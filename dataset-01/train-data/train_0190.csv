5,Realistic Look At 50's Naval Aviation,"This is one of the best movies ever made about the U.S. Navy. If nothing else, the detailed scenes of a straight-deck carrier operating F9F Panthers is fascinating. Many of the features of shipboard life and the procedures for carrier-based jet aviation survive onboard modern CVs. I'm sure there were few things that could be more ""exciting"" than to be launched off a short deck in a first-generation jet fighter. A solid story line with good acting makes all the characters believable. A true classic!"
4,An Anti-War Film,"THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI gives a very realistic account of fighting during the Korean War. The movie also repeatedly raises questions about the futility of war. Most of those questions are asked by Lieutenant Harry Brubaker, a navy reserve pilot called back to duty from his job as a lawyer in civilian life.Brubaker is played by William Holden in one of his most unforgettable roles. Grace Kelly as Brubaker's wife has a minor but important part. The supporting cast of Fredric March, Mickey Rooney, Robert Strauss and Earl Holliman is superb."
5,good old w. holden navy movie,just fine dvd as expected bridges at toko-ri as had prior vhs and other navy fliks thank you very much
3,Ordered because it was recommended by Astronaut Niel Armstrong,"An avid reader, I recently read a book titled ""FIrst Man - The Life of Neil A. Armstrong"" an authorized biography by James R. Hansen. In it is an excerpt where astronaut Neil Armstrong is quoted as really liking the old movie ""The Bridges over Toko-Ri""...so I ordered it from Amazon. It came promptly and I watched it right away, anxious to see it. The movie is simply an old war movie. It is very darkly lit so it was difficult to see well. It was the expected story line and was an ""ok"" movie. I'm not sure why it's a Neil Armstrong favorite other than it is a period movie about, perhaps, the time in history that most interests him. I'm not sure I would buy this movie again if I knew it was so poorly lit that it made it hard to see or enjoy."
5,It Would Not Be The Same Without Grace Kelly,"Other reviewers have done an excellent job of discussing the plot of this film and related matters. I just wanted to add a few of my own thoughts.THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI is definitely a war movie but it also has Grace Kelly and a nice romantic interlude in the middle of the motion picture.Of all the war movies I can recall this is one of the most memorable. It is not because of the action, although the final action sequence seems to be particularly realistic. Instead it is because Holden's character goes through such agonies of conscience and the corresponding reaction of Grace Kelly is so believable.Mickey Rooney and Earl Holliman are terrific. In fact, this may be one of Mickey's very best roles in his long career.If I wanted to recommend a film on the Korean War, this would be my first choice."
4,Reveals the inner thoughts of Korean War Naval Aviator,"In this excellent adaptation of Michener's book of the same name, William Holden delivers a terrific look at the thoughts and worries of a man flying off ""the boat"". The flying scenes are excellent, and the ramp strike footage has been reused many times in hollywood, most notably in ""The Hunt for Red October"". One of the best plotlines is that between Holden's character and the flying chief, played by Mickey Rooney. The way each man looks out for one another, across the lines of fraternization, says a great deal about the actual comraderie found in both the military and in combat. If you like Naval Aviation, this ""Top Gun-Korea edition"" is a must have in your aviation library. Also of note, is the soliloquy given at the very end,(Where do we get such men?....) which has become a cherished quote about those who fly from the pitching decks."
3,"Good Movie, But No Wide screen","The Theme here is a Navy Reservist, from WWII, called back into service, and thus putting his civilian career on hold to take part in our little Police action in Korea. Sounds too familiar, and too much like life imitating art, or art imitating...Any way those fans of movies about aviation will love this movie, and its dipiction of how fast ones life, and perspectives can change, and war is hell and all that.Good story line and plot, with a bit of mystery, will the mission be a success, or no? Tune in to see.I have but one complaint, why no widescreen?"
3,Only in Hollywood,"Enjoyable are the actors, setting, subject, USN aircraft, ships and operations circa 1954.The plot is B grade at best.Flag officers do not become emotionally involved with Lt's. Lt carrier aviators don't need the emotional support. If they do - wrong profession.Jets didn't haul the mail USN Korea. The Spads were the heavy haulers followed by Corsairs.Close to the ground, down a valley into a heavy AAA defense?Spads are made for the vertical dive.Jets similar, in first with frags for the gunners.The real story of the movie ending:[...]"
2,Didn't care for this classic...,"I thought I would like this one. My wife's uncle as actually on-board the aircraft carrier when the filming was done. Unfortunately, I thought movie was slow moving and the end was silly."
2,disappointing.,"the writer of this movie is well known but this one is one of his bad stories. the only thing i enjoyed about this movie is how they showed how an aircraft carrier works. other than that the story sucks. the ending is awful. watch the movie ""bataan"" and you will see the comparison on how these movies compare."
3,Bridges at To Ko Ri,"The DVD quality, supplier delivery date, were satisfactory. Personally, I thought it the worst of William Holden's movies; very little in story and plot quality."
2,the bridges at toko-ri,The dvd ordered (the bridges at toko-ri) would not play in region 1. It would only play in region 2. Another country. I had to pay for the shipping both ways when sending it back. I would have liked for them to send me one that would play in region 1 but they would not. Have no idea where to order this dvd from. Timothy Orn
3,The Bridges at Toko-Ri,"I was really excited when I saw this movie on the shelf at the library. It was one of the few Grace Kelly movies I had not seen. I was not prepared for the ending though - It was very disappointing and extremely sad.William Holden is Henry Brubaker, a naval reserve, sent on an assignment to destroy the bridges of Toko-Ri during the Korean War. Before he goes off on the assignment, he meets his wife, Nancy (Grace Kelly) and his two little girls at Tokyo. Grace Kelly is beautiful as usual, and William Holden is great at his part. Mickey Rooney also stars as Brubaker's friend. This is a good movie except for the ending."
4,One of the best films about the Korean War,"The Bridges at Toko-ri, based on the novel by James Michener, is the story of a reserve naval aviator, Harry Brubaker (William Holden), a World War II veteran, who gets re-activated during the Korean War. He is bitter about being torn from his wife (Grace Kelly), 2 young daughters, and his law practice and sent to fight in a war about which he feels ambivalent. In the end he does his job well but pays with his life during a difficult mission to destroy 3 bridges. The cast is first rate with fine supporting work by Frederic March (Rear Adm. George Tarrant) and Mickey Rooney (Mike Forney), a rescue helicopter pilot. The action and flying sequences are exciting, including a ditching at sea, rescue of the downed pilot (Holden), and the attack on the bridges. This is one of the best movies about the Korean War."
4,The romantic view of war with a surprisingly cruel finale,"This film about USN's air war over North Korea in 1952, has some strong merits, like the realistic aerial scenes and especially that of the air strike on the bridges of Toko-Ri and, of course, Grace Kelly who is really marvelous. On the other side it depicts the war in a romantic sense (like a pilot reporting to the admiral wearing a robe, or loudspeakers giving orders on the deck of an aircraft carrier like it is a cruise boat etc.) which has little to do with the real thing. The actual raid on the bridges though is very well filmed given the technical abilities of the era and the finale is far more realistic than what you could find in most war films."
4,Almost a recruiting film,"This movie was released in 1954, and it is based on the James Michener novel. It is the story of a Navy reservist pilot who was called up to action during the Korean War. The movie explores his feelings of leaving behind his law practice, wife, and two daughters to fight in the war.This is not the typical war movie with lots of action footage. In terms of war action, there is the run by the bridges to take pictures, and then there is the run to destroy the bridges and the attack by the communist forces. Other than, the action includes picking up a downed pilot and landing on an aircraft carrier.This does not mean this is bad movie. This was a movie that draws attention to the dedicated pilots who give up the comfort of home to fight for their country. Listening to the admiral talk of this, you will think this may be a recruiting film.I would recommend seeing this film."
5,ndolo en wuen; (my love for it),the cd is jam packed with the most caressing zouk music of all times and i can't help myself every time i play it.
5,BP Large cuff,When I received this unit I plugged it into my Omron monitor and the readings have stabilized and are consistant.
4,Large sleeve works great,"This sleeve is much bigger than one might imagine, thus should be large enough for even the biggest of arms."
3,"13""-17"" Large Cuff accessory","As a personal trainer, I bought this accessory to go with the OMRON Blood Pressure Monitor HEM-712C. The large cuff fits arms from 13"" to 17"" which can accommodate those who may be a bit overweight or large like bodybuilders. It works fine.Although I couldn't say that about the OMRON HEM-712C Blood Pressure Monitor, which runs on batteries. It didn't always give me a reliable reading with or without this large cuff because of using batteries. I eventually opted to buy another brand blood pressure monitor that runs on electricity. It was more reliable. I tried to use this cuff with it but it was a different brand and didn't fit.I eventually achieved good results using a wrist blood pressure monitor.This cuff works good, but, I recommend using it with an OMRON monitor that runs on electricity. It needs more power to inflate than batteries can supply."
3,PRODUCT OK,I use my blood pressure unit several time a week; so I needed a cuff for my larger biceps that was easy to use. This cuff is better than the smaller original cuff that came with the unit. But the new cuff needed more adjustments of the strap than I expected. In a phrase: workable but not perfect.
5,Works Great,"Our old cuff developed a leak and would not inflate, and this new cuff works great and helps us keep tabs on our BP."
3,"It fit my arm, BUT...","It fit my arm, but didnt fit my machine do its useless. Seems like it would be a great product though. I just wish in the description it would tell you what types of machines it fits."
5,works great,I tried it out and it works great. The fit was better than the regular one that came with the unit.
1,Misleading information,"I purchased the Omron large cuff which says on the package you can use with all Omron automatic or manual digital blood pressure monitors with a D ring cuff. I have no idea what a D ring cuff is as my Omron blood pressure machine doesn't mention it. My husband has a big arm so I read all the reviews and believed I had found just what we needed so he could comfortably use my machine. Today his cardiologist took him off his meds for a week but he wanted to see what his pressure was. I opened the box, followed the instructions, and the tip did NOT fit in my Omron bp machine. So before you buy this, make sure you don't believe everything you read!"
2,Completely Unnecessary,"Unless your a body builder or have really large arms this cuff is way too big for most people. I am 6 foot, 225 lbs, and it is way too big for me."
1,CANNOT USE BECAUSE OMRON BLOOD PRESSURE GUAGE IS DEFECTIVE,Having this Large Adult Accessory Cuff is a moot point since the device I purchased from you to use it on is defective. The device was replaced once with an equally defective unit.
3,OMRON H003D Large Adult Accessory Cuff,This cuff is exactly what I needed to get an accurate blood pressure reading. It is just like the smaller cuff that came with the tester except for the larger size.
3,Misleading description; no return possible,"I needed a larger cuff size for obese patients. The product indicates that it is a large size 13-17"". When it arrived it was the standard size 9 - 17"" which is no different than the one that I already have. The message from the company before I ordered had not been clear that this cuff would not solve my problem. The company refuses to accept returns although the product has never been used. I wasted my money on this purchase."
4,For large arms,"My arms are is too big for the small cuff, besides not fitting the readings were all over the place. The large cuff is easy to interchange; slip out the hose for the small cuff and slip in the hose for the large cuff."
4,Arrived early,"Works very well, but not as easy to put by yourself as others. placing item on the arm is kind of hard to keep straight when placing around the arm for a secure fit."
1,"For the Insomniac, Not the History Buff","Although this video is a nice survey of information about the cities, it's production value was mediocre at best, and the educational content was sparse. The presentation was monotonous and literally put my students to sleep. Even I was hard-pressed to keep my eyes open and I'm fascinated by the subject. There are too many better videos out there on the subject to waste your time here."
4,Roman Architecture as it was built,"As an Architect who has been to Rome, it is very difficult to imagine the ancient splendour of the buildings that are now in ruins. This video is fascinating in the fact that it rebuilds the Roman temples and ruins to emulate what they once were - absolutely magnificent! No wonder that it won the best Italian film and ENIT prize for 1994."
5,A Must Have!,"This is definitely a ""Must Have"" for your polymer clay library. Ellen's surface design techniques are very inspiring, the photos are stunning, and the instructions are clear and concise."
1,Could they possibly speak any slower?,"I found this French learning audio CD to be on the pathetic side mainly because the French speaker repeats the French very slowly, which is not going to help you understand a native speaker who is speaking at a normal pace. You don't realize just how quickly people speak until you are trying to learn a language and you visit a place where that language is spoken. I would get another CD set if you want to learn French."
3,Speaking French to strangers!,"I did not find this CD and the accompanying booklet overly hepful as it didn't give me casual ways to converse with French family members....which is what I was hoping for. I did get some vocabulary and grammar review from it, but I found that it moved too quickly and did not give me enough time to incorporate the words and phrases in a useful way. All in all, I listend to it for awhile and then put it away. I may try again some other time, but I will also seek a CD that focuses more on personal conversation...that a family might have, rather than conversation that tourists would have if they were going to Paris or other French cities. That's when this CD would be more helpful. In France with French people rather than in the U.S. with French visitors."
1,Don't Buy It!,"Don't waste your money on ""Listen and Learn French"" - the ""teacher"" actually sounds like an old voice over from the 50's or 60's (and sounds kind of angry). I couldn't listen for more than 10 minutes - no value added. Spend the extra couple bucks for Drive Time French - those cd's are awesome!"
4,Black Lung - 'The Depopulation Bomb' (Fifth Column),"Black Lung's music has been called a 'soundtrack' for a film or a movie that has yet to be made,while others consider them to be a good choice of thinking man's ambient music.I've heard the duo,members John Lieberkuch and David Thrussell reside somewhere in Australia.This is the kind of music that requires the listener(s) to close their eyes,open their mind and expect the unexpected.If you decide to check out this CD,be sure to soak your thoughts heavily into cuts like ""The Unreality Industry"",""The More Confusion"",""Angstlos"" and the way-out there ""The Drone Of The Castle"".This is your pilot speaking...we sincerely hope you have a nice trip."
5,Michael Jackson Thriller cd & dvd dual disc - Michael's Invention,I love this artwork with Michael's photo. It is rare. The item is a cd on one side and a dvd on the other side. This was Michael's idea. Michael created this dual disc concept while people were still trying to figure how to program their VCRs for VHS. Michael was a pioneer. A genius. A Human Masterpiece. In afterlife Michael has found a way to send his love from heaven to us here on earth. I love Michael. I miss Michael every moment of every day.
5,Out of the darkness...into the light,"Brilliantly written story of the tragic childhood of Mary Ellen Wilson. Through every illfated twist in her life, the author pulls you emotionally into the story and makes you want to reach out a catch Mary Ellen as she falls through every crack in the system. Thank you Eric A. Shelman & Stephen Lazoritz for taking this story out of the darkness and bringing it into the light on the pages of your book. It's a great read & I found it difficult to put the book down! It not only makes you feel the darkness of Mary Ellen's early life, you also celebrate the heroes who saved her. I read this book constantly wondering why such a significant story sat untold for soooo many years! It must have been waiting for these authors to tell her tale."
5,THE BEST ANIMAL RIGHTS BOOK EVER,"This book is perfect for anybody interested in animal rights, human rights or even local history (New York). I could not put this book down. I have never read a better book!!! If you only read one book this year make it Out of the Darkness you will not be let down."
5,Make room in your heart for Mary Ellen...,"Child abuse is a subject many people would prefer not to think about. This account of the life of Mary Ellen Wilson will change that way of thinking. This story will open your heart to a little girl who, for much of her childhood had no friends, no hugs, no kisses, no bedtime ""I love you"" moments. The book will take you from the beginnings of a love story, through death, child abuse, hate, compassion, rescue, and survival. It's a must read for anyone who thinks that one person cannot make a difference in the life of a child. Thank you, Mr. Shelman and Dr. Lazoritz for bringing Mary Ellen into our lives...may the doors of our hearts be opened as a result."
1,Waste of money,"I came upon this book while browsing through the HISTORY section on Amazon. Be aware that this book is actually historical FICTION. And not very good historical fiction. The writing is terrible. I can't understand all of the five star ratings as the book falls well below the level of a third rate bodice ripper. I have picked it up and put it down 4 times and still can't get through it. As a rule I will read everything I purchase because I hate to throw money away but I can honestly say this the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. If I could have given it no star, I would."
3,Incomprehensible to the Untrained Reader,"I bought this book based on a bibliographical entry in Burton Stein's ""A History of India."" Perhaps I was being conceited as Stein calls it ""very deep stuff"" and I thought ""I like very deep stuff."" This book, however, uses formal logic of the third-semester-logic-course variety, two semesters beyond what I took ever so long ago. Additionally, most of the essays require working knowledge of Sanskrit, a dead language. If you fit either of these qualifications then, by god, read this book and make your education worthwhile. Otherwise you're up a creek on this one.The introduction, incidentally, is very interesting, but pertains more to his book ""Exploring Mysticism"" which I've just ordered as he made it sound so fascinating. Read that one."
5,Moment In Time,"This is a recording of Brenda Lee Live in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra with arrangements written and conducted by Ray Bunch (of Star Trek Enterprise, Flight 93, The Pretender fame).Other credits go to Brenda's band - Tom Rogers (piano), Chuck Spence (bass), Charlie Wood (drums), all from Nashville, Tennessee and David P. Reinen (lead guitar) from Oregon.I was a member of this band and when I discovered this DVD was available, I found myself watching Brenda more than myself.There are entertainers that are highly paid and receive words of praise throughout their careers - Brenda Lee deserves every penny and every word.It was an honor and a joy working for her and being part of a great band.Thanks Brenda...and thanks guys."
4,Great Video,"Although this is close to 30 years old (1978) , it shows Brenda Lee as the all time great she was in the rockabilly and rock&roll; world.Worth purchasing if you are a Brenda Lee fan like I am."
3,disappointed,I wish I had realized that this DVD was of a concert from 1978. I sat down to watch it and wondered why everyone looked like the 70s and then read in small print that it was from 1978. I was disappointed. I thought it would have been of a more current concert.She is still a talented artist though.
2,Feliway electric diffuser (48 ml),"I purchased this for my skittish cat. She didn't really respond to it. My big problem with this product is that it is supposed to last a month, and it was empty in 2 weeks. I was very disappointed, since I really don't think my cat had a chance to respond to it. I won't purchase it again. It's pretty pricey and it didn't last."
1,Can't believe this video is $30.00,"My best friend bought this video recently and was just as dissapointed as some of the reviewers here. I thought she was exagerating, so I borrowed it and could not believe how absolutely awful it is. You don't have to be in the film business to understand how unprofessional and bad it is. I'll not go into any details as other reviewers here have said it all and very well. I'll only say that I am sooooooo glad that I did not waste my money on it."
1,SLOPPY CRAFTSMANSHIP,"As a videographer who has produced in the film industry for years I cannot beleive this video could ever win any type of award. The person who performed editing and titleing cannot speak or spell English even near properly. Lighting and production borders on being terrible, and lighting is so poor that in a number of cases you cannot see what the teacher is doing. There is also no variation in techniques offering the viewer different methods which could be used on different subjects. There are much better videos on the market for the same price.A Hollywood Producer"
1,A MUST for MST3K fans,"The DVD version is a rare gem. Of course, the movie is as bad (or worse) than you imagine from the hackneyed copy. But played with the commentary by the yahoo writer (replete with catty comments about the Director's girlfriend)--this treat transcends the awful to acheive Enlightened Idiocy.1 Star goes for the camera work for remaining in focus throughout (for the most part).Heck it's even cheaper than the new Boyz2Men CD--go for it."
5,The leviathan story.,"I LOVED this story and, contrary to popular belief, it was NOT the Leviathan story that killed ""DS"" but the AWFUL story that followed--the 'parallel time 1970' story. Look at the old ratings and one will see that the absolutely boring 'PT 1970"" plots plus the absence of the main actors-Frid, Bennett, Barrett, etc... who were off making the first movie-is when the ratings slid downhill. ""DS"" ratings actually jumped back up during the '1841 PT', enough to save the show but Bennett and Frid both wanted to quit and ABC didn't like the 'cult' audience that the show attracted. It is ironic that ABC didn't like the young audience being the source of the huge ratings figuring they did not control the household purchasing thus meaning they only wanted the 25--45 age range watching their shows. In this day and age that teen-age to 25 year old viewing audience is what EVERY network wants. ""DS' was ahead of its time in many ways."
5,Holden Caulfield,"Well, I agree with the raves regarding this book. I believe this extends past an armchair sea-cruising book and wallows into classic literature. But I'm not an expert on that so I can't say for sure. However, this story that Caldwell tells closely resembles Holden Caulfield in Salinger's classic. I've always thought this after I put the book down. The transference from normal to borderline and then a psychotic state is very slow and subtle. I'll go no further. You'll have to read it."
5,Desperate Voyage,This was a very insightfull book of one man's sailing adventure to return to his true love. I was very moved by this book as I have visited both Costa Rica (from where he starts his adventure) and where he finally found his perfect island in the West Indies. Both sailers and non sailers will love his humour and love.
4,Excitante lectura,"Un relato extraordinario. Te quitará horas de sueño y alimentará tus sueños. (¡Y tus pesadillas!) Aunque no es una lectura recomendable para quien no tenga ya un buen nivel de inglés, la naturalidad y sencillez del relato te atrapa con su ritmo y su fiebre. Desde luego, peca de evidentes y numerosos excesos y fantasías completamente inverosímiles, como pescar y subir a bordo a un tiburón vivo de varios metros que termina destrozando el barco o comer cuero de zapato frito con aceite de motor, lo cual parece un poco excesivo incluso para el proverbial mal gusto culinario que atribuimos a ingleses y sajones. Pero la tensión y la viveza del relato es tal que eclipsa cualquier defecto. Gran viaje y gran libro. Apaga la tele y disfrútalo."
2,gave it away after one chapter,I am not a sailor although I have owned several large power boats over the years. I was looking forward to a survival at sea adventure but became lost in the jargon of sailing and gave the book to one of my sail boating friends who I am sure will enjoy and appreciate the language of sail boating.
2,Hipper than thou . . .,". . . and a hellava lot more boring.Yes, these guys are the coolest thing ever to emerge from the jam band wasteland. Yes, they can play circles around most of their cohorts. Yes, John Medeski has killer keyboard chops (why doesn't he use 'em?), as witnessed by his duo album with Andre Jaume, the French sax great.But where's the substance?Nowhere to be found, sad to say.Some really radio-friendly, massively ephemeral tunes: a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing."
5,They are still creative,"I was impressed with this album. Being a fan since Shackman, and owner of every album on the market, I eagerly await each new release. Uninvisible let me down--Not that it is bad. But it seemed like a sequel to Combustification, and at certain points, it sounded recycled. When End of the World Party came out, my expectations were lower than usual. I was hoping that it would be new and alive. And it was. This album is a progression of their cataloge.At times it sounds like music made on a computer. But knownig that this is unlikely (correct me if I'm wrong) it makes the music interesting as an organic/inorganic blend. Rather than taking a computer to make music that sounds like real instraments, this is music made from real instraments and real musicians that sounds like music made on a computer. I think that is cool. It is a far distance from MMW's earlier stuff that sounds like standard trio jazz.The only problem with this album is it raises the bar for their next album."
2,Jazz for people who hate jazz.,This stuff makes Kenny G. look avant-garde. I like fusion as much as anybody but I know supermarkets that would refuse to play this crap. Stay away.
1,Not sure why this was recommended to me,"This was recommended to me based on prior purchase - Mofro. It sucked, instrumental only, no lyrics."
4,Almost there,"I was stoked to pick up this album, for I am quite the MMW fan. After listening to the whole thing, I can say that I have definitely heard better from MMW, and I have heard stuff that was a little worse. I will single out a couple songs. The first song ""Anonymous Skulls"" really didn't grab me at all. The title track, however, was pretty grooving. ""Ice"" was also another track that just wasn't my cup of tea. ""New Planet"", ""Mami Gato"", ""Curtis"", and ""Sasa"" were very enjoyable tracks. The two last tracks, ""Midnight Poppies"" and ""Queen Bee"" were a perfect coup de grace to this again different MMW album."
3,recorded late at night?,"This is certainly an eclectic, interesting album by MMW, with lots of good ideas swirling around. Love the idea of having Ribot sit in, too. I have to wonder if it was recorded in a boozy late night session, though, because there are quite a few instances of sloppy tempo that puzzlingly arise in the middle of good grooves. Now, I have no expectation (or desire) for them to be paced like a drum machine, and some elasticity in a groove is part of what makes it work. But, really, I was surprised at all the points where the tempo got down-right sloppy on this album. These guys are much better players than that. That's what makes me wonder (only somewhat facetiously) if it was recorded buzzed, then kept because the vibe was considered more important than the tightness. Anyway, maybe if you get yourself in the same condition while listening to it, you'll be right in sync. I haven't tried that yet, but....."
5,Oh so catchy,"As a long time fan of MMW, I have been disappointed with some of their post-Combustication work, but this CD has certainly revived my love of their funky hooks and fusion jazz. I play it alongside Herbie Hancock, Miles and John McLaughlin, and ""End"" never fails to draw me in. I especially like ""Bloody Oil"" and ""New Planet"" coming through back to back, and ""Curtis"" is a wonderfully uplifting tune that creeps up and then soars. The other noteworthy song is ""Queen Bee"" which feels like a sixties throwback and I can imagine the Doors jamming it out while Jim Morrison takes an extended break in the wings. It is more than gimmicks and hooks though as they develop their musical motifs and take chances, including some feedback that drives my more conservative wife crazy."
5,A psychedelic jazz masterpiece,"Jazz purists probably hate this album. However, I think it is a masterpiece. Imagine a funky ""In A Silent Way"" by Miles Davis cut up in 4 minute snippets with some psychedelia thrown in for good measure. MMW have always been determined to go their own way for better or worse. In this case it is for the better. I wish they would do more music like this and keep pushing the envelope, jazz purists be damned. I love this album. If you have a soul you will love it, too!"
3,One is enough,"Some of the furniture in this book is pretty amazing, but I was disappointed in the end, and unfortunately, I bought three of his books so it was compounded. Much of the furniture is rustic casework, decorated fabulously with twigs and bark, but still casework as best I can tell. If you're looking for artistic inspiration, you're not going to get a hint of construction details! Many of the chairs and beds are also pretty ""straight""--lots of hickory stick furniture.The antler work is nifty. The staircases are amazing. The photography is good. There're just too many right angles for my taste in ""rustic."""
2,ok for 1984,This movie prolly was good back in 1984 but watching it for the first in 2013 leaves a lot to be desired.
2,Captions?,I remember watching this on tv and loved the story. I recorded it on VHS during that time. Now I want to buy it on DVD. But I can't because it is not captioned or subtitled for the deaf. So what is the point of buying it? There is ADA law that now says all movies should be captioned or subtitled. I still see a lack of respect of not doing that on many films or tv shows regardless of what year it was made. Pls made this movie captioned and all other movies and tv shows captioned from now now. Thanks!!
1,not received,"I was charged for this item but never received it. I corrected my address but never got it. My other 2 movies came, though."
1,good movie - BAD DVD,"I am a 29 year old man who remebered this movie fondly from my childhood. So i pointed, clicked and oredered it up. I was horrified the instant the menu came up on screen and the option to start the movie was spelled wrong, it read ""STRAT MOVIE"". This should give you some idea as to the level of care and attention that went into the production of this inferior product.The picture quality was unforgivable. Usually a bad transfer doesnt bother me that much as long as I can see whats going on, but this movie transfer is pathetic. I am not kidding when I say that you are better off ordering a clean VHS copy than wasting your time and money on this DVD. It was absolutely unwatchable on my widescreen TV, I eventually had to put it in my computer to watch it as the ""pixelization"" was so bad ... consider youself warned....."
4,Overlooked Movie Is Actually Good,"The Philedelphia Experiment has been overlooked for a long time. I don't remember when I first saw this movie, but I remember really liking it. I was about 7.Later in my life, I was perusing my local Blockbuster, and I spotted a copy. So I rented it.Michael Pare is good as always. For a movie of its obviously limited budget, the effects are really good. Nancy Allen is good, heck, all the acting is good. The music is rousing, and the plot is interesting. It really needs a Widescreen release from Anchore Bay Entertainment.My advice, get this movie. Its really good. And the sequel isn't half bad either."
4,A must-see movie for SCI FI fans.,"Even though the movie shows its age, the plot is still exciting for science fiction fans. The effects are ok, but what makes this movie is the results of the experiment which is complicated by the second experiment."
3,Entertaining Sci-Fi,"This is the type movie that is interesting because of the era that it was filmed in. Not very sophisticated FX but the story line is paced well and is supposed to be based in an actual event that occurred. Nancy Allen is good as a friend to the confused sailors that go through the experiment and try to cope with the results of being transported into the future. Michael Pare is okay in the lead character role and this film sort of runs along the lines of the Kirk Douglas feature where an entire modern day aircraft carrier is transported back in time to December 7, 1941, except that because of a similar time travel misshap, the Philadelphia Experiment transports two young sailors into the future. This is a decent ""B"" movie good for a late Friday or Saturday night viewing and interesting enough to watch from time to time. I liked it, that is why I jumped at the chance to add it to my collection."
3,Philadelphia Experiment,This movie is supposedly based on a true story. It's not the most believable movie I've ever seen but I still find it very enjoyable to watch nonetheless.
3,"decent enough,but i would recommend The Final Countdown as a superior film","as time travel travel movies goes this one's pretty decent.i've seen afew in my time,many of them stinkers,and this is certainly nostinker.it isn't necessarily the best of the genre,but it works forwhat it is.it's fairly low key and sedate.the special effects rangefrom not bad to pretty good,especially for the time period during whichthe movie was made.the acting was pretty decent as well,though also lowkey,like the rest of the movie.the story is decent enough.the moviereminded me of another time travel movie from 1980 starring KirkDouglas called The Final Countdown,which to me is a superior movie.asfor The Philadelphia Experiment,i give it a 3/5"
3,A so-so film,"This movie was ok. I don't know what else to say. It was entertaining, but not fantastic. It didn't leave me wanting to see it again, but it wasn't boring or poorly done. It was just ok."
5,Philadelphia Experiment,"I ordered this for my mother. It came very quickly and was sealed, so it was obviously new. It never skipped scenes."
3,Good Movie Poor DVD,"I love this story. I've had VHS versions for years. This2009 DVD says on the Back cover there are ""English subtitlesfor the hearing impaired."" NOT ONLY are there no subtitles,there is not even Closed Captioning. Also no attempt was madeto remaster the picture. It is a 2009 DVD that looks exactlylike the vhs tape. So if you have the VHS version, don't spenda penny on either the 2000 or 2009 DVD. I was very disappointed."
4,theme continuation,The thought of this timeline style film was a great step-forward for films like Back To The Future and it's sequels. I am hoping that further storylines can be developed following this same concept in the future!Peter
4,great pop up book,I bought this as a gift for a friend who is getting quite a pop-up book collection. It's great. Very creative and full of many of our favorite nightmares!! She liked it a lot.Only complaint - would be nice to have more nightmares in it - but that is just because we are greedy.
5,WOW,"I thought Gary Greenberg's first pop up book established a new benchmark for this genre, but this book is even better. The explanations of the nightmares are so outstanding that I found myself, in many instances, believing they were factual. Even Siggy Freud would be impressed. Balvis Rubess, as usual, does a great job with the illustrations, while the three-dimentional paper sculpting by Matthew Reinhart is truly amazing. If you enjoyed the ""Pop Up Book Of Phobias"", you'll absolutely love this one. And if you have not, as yet, experienced ""Phobias"", buy them both!"
2,A bit of a dissapointment...,Although not a waste of money (time) this book left me flat. The cover gave me the hope of something unique and strange - and my expectation was that the graphics and pop-ups would follow suit.This was not the case.It was mundane and pedestrian in concept and delivery.
5,One of the year's best films.,"This is one of the year's best films, and one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Don't be misled by the title's implication that this is a film for racing fans. This is much more about dreams, and is a film for families and anyone dealing with young teens at this crucial turning point in their lives. Director Marshall Curry is a talent to watch. He skillfully captures the tension, drama and subtext of his subjects, without crossing into an emotional manipulation of his audience. I concur with the unanimous praise bestowed upon Racing Dreams by the 20+ national reviewers on the RottenTomatoes website, who have given the film a 100% fresh ranking, the year's best score!"
3,Closed Caption/English Subtitle not included,"This current version purchased has no closed caption/English Subtitle not included in this documentary film, I really like go-kart racing stuff... would like to replace with latest version of this DVD or on Blu-Ray to have English Subtitle in it(we are hearing impaired viewers and using HDMI cable between player/TV, cannot pass TV closed caption through HDMI cable, only subtitle will work)"
5,Best Documentary I Have Ever Seen,"A Spellbound or Mad Hot Ballroom for the NASCAR set, Racing Dreams ends up speeding past its niche market and working its magic on anyone with a rooting interest in the dreams and ambitions of this country's youth."
5,Great compact field manual,"I love this book. I'm an anthropology student, so I have osteology textbooks (notably the one by Tim White) and what I was looking for this time was precisely what I got: something that condenses all of the information of a textbook into a more portable form. This is not, I believe, a book for actually LEARNING osteology, and I don't think it's designed for that, so if you're looking to get a really in-depth look at the human skeleton, I do recommend going for textbooks first (or a class if you have the opportunity.) But this is a great supplemental reference material.One drawback that people have already touched upon is the physical book itself. The cover seems in constant danger of falling off, and the wire ring binding gets in the way of comfortable perusal. I do hope they make a sturdier edition in the future. But for me, it's not enough of a drawback to mark it down. It's still excellent at what it does, and I recommend it."
3,Good Field Manuel,Dr. Bass's book is well written with good descriptions of bone details. The spiral binding makes it easy to keep open to the page while using your hands for other things like holding the bone. The one problem I have with it is that there are no pictures all the bones are drawn. I would suggest Folkens and White for lab work and a study tool and Bass's book for being in the field and quick reference.
1,Not a history of the ostrich,"Though well written, this is NOT a history of the ostrich, but rather an autobiography of a man who grew up within view of the ostrich industry in his native South Africa, and then was able to run across them and write about them later in life.There is really nothing new in this book with regards to the history of the ostrich, and the author indeed had nothing to do with the industry at all - at any point in his life.If you are buying this book for insights into the history of this magnificent bird in food, fashion and fortune, then you will be disappointed to be sure.Nice story of Nixon's life, well written, and only occasionally pedantic; however a history of the ostrich this is not."
1,Very ugly earrings,"Really dislike the way these earrings look and sit in the ear. No way I would have purchased if seen in person. But I can't fault the listing or seller, it's my own fault."
2,The prose is totally unreadable.,"I had high hopes for this book. But as I got into it I found myself having difficulty linking the concepts together. At first I though it was me but after a while I started to parse the sentences. I soon concluded that the sentences are totally unreadable, full of vague terms, run on constructions and, perhaps, paradoxical comparsions that are not readily apparent. Take these two sentences selected at random:In both cases they were outsiders to the collectivity, thus exacerbating their opprobrium. Even a plurality of opinions had no effect on this second accusation, which followed from the first, since the bourgeois were no less detested on the left than on the right.Now maybe this makes more sense in the original French. The translation is by Furet's wife, Deborah who may be so intune with her husband so as to assume more from English reader than is usual.A great disappointment."
5,Furet,"Whether the skill of his wife's translation or not, this man wrote in this work some of the best historical prose I've ever read. A profundity on every other page in a field that's been exhausted by the historical profession."
5,Keep Young Hands Busy!,"[This review was first published in the ""Ephrata (Pa.) Review.""]Bright felt squares, needle, embroidery floss, scissors. These four basic materials and a child's hands can create 60 practical items for personal use, decorations or gifts.Labeled ""very easy,"" ""easy,"" ""a little harder,"" and ""challenging,"" the projects include games (tic-tac-toe and checkers boards), household items (coasters, placemats), apparel (vests, baby bibs), decorations (Christmas tree skirt, mobiles) and toys (beanbags, puppets).The book's format is kid friendly. Its binding allows the large pages to lie flat. Instructions are numbered and clear, and each craft is generously illustrated with large photos. Instructions for basic stitches and patterns are included."
2,Could Be Better,I am disappointed in this book as it has very few projects. Too much money for so little information.
4,I love This Game,Very interesting not too difficult to learn. Bought it back when I was in college to pass the time
5,Just like old times,It was a surprise when I realized it shipped with the expansion set as well. Game looks brand new and I have had no trouble with anything except for the Gods. This game is insanly addictive and very hard to put away once your start playing.
4,An exploration of integrity vs. faith,"The agony that a fine academician and scholar such as B. H. Roberts must have endured is evident in this collection of his letters and essays. One can empathize with his struggles as he tries valiantly to reconcile his religious yearnings with the rigors of genuine inquiry. Ultimately, the book makes no sweeping conclusions as to B. H. Roberts's personal beliefs regarding the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. But, what is clear, is that he was deeply troubled by the preponderance of the evidence that comes down against it. The book is as much an exploration of the difficulties of maintaining intellectual integrity while trying to hold religious beliefs as it is a continuing source of serious challenge to the lofty claims made by the Book of Mormon itself."
5,Ulysses: Adventure out of time,The code for the wheel: at 12: 4-4-4. that will solve the entire wheel if you know your math.
3,"You know, there is another way....","go to cyberflix.com and there is a forum about this game. With out those people's help, I wouldn't have beatten it."
4,very helpful,"To US of A: It's ok to get clonked on the head. You can get the notebook back by going to turbine room while the ship is sinking. First,get the shawl from Claris Limehouse then trade Vlad the shawl for the notebook. Finished game today! Good Luck!"
5,Excellent Book!,"I totally love this book! It tells of all the secrets and hints in the game. Without it, I would have never finished the game. I just completed the game and won, and I love it! If anybody has any questions, or anything, feel free to ask me. :-)"
4,You can solve the complicated game with this book!,This book was a lifesaver. After playing the game for many hours without advancing the plot (and becoming very frustrated) I decided to get the book. You can use the book to just solve little parts of the puzzle or take you step-by-step to the final moments. I am so glad that I bought this book. I finally finished the game!
5,Great all plastic gate valve,I use these on aquariums where I need more control over flow than a ball valve provides. They also put less pressure on bulkheads since they require less force to open and close. These are heavy duty and with no metal parts I don't need to worry About corrosion.
4,The story in his words...,"Mr. Barrett interviewed Geronimo after several years of his captivity and this is his version of what happened in the Apache Wars. Definately an interesting read and a great story. Not what you should read if interested in a complete history of the Apache Wars and the part Geronimo had, but still worthwhile as it tells it from his prespective in his old age."
5,Geronimo . . . Reappraised,"This is a fascinating, well-written, tightly-woven, factual story. It brings sympathy and empathy for a flawed but great man to the serious reader. Written from ""The Victim's"" own perspective, this book is an essential read for anyone who cares about a balanced evaluation of the sad plight, (then and now) of our true Native Americans. I suppose there probably couldn't have been any other outcome, given the times and the inevitable result of a collision between the onslaught of an industrial culture and a Stone Age way of life . . . but there SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER WAY."
1,Dull,"For those interested in Apache history, this may make a nice read, but most of it amounts to a catalog of battles, which to me, are very uninteresting. Some aspects of the way Geronimo thought comes out, but this was basically a boring, tedious book."
3,Had to have it for a class,"As far as class textbooks go, this one is okay. It's not especially gripping, but it does give the reader an oft-overlooked view of the Native American's role in American history through the eyes of Geronimo."
1,Shame on Amazon,"This book is currently out of copyright and should be available for free for the Kindle. Alas the free version is nowhere to be found. You can, however, find the free version on iBooks. Very disappointed in Amazon for allowing people to profit off material whose copyright has expired. Shame. Get your act together, Amazon, before the iPad becomes the number one eReader."
2,Who needs covers?,"This was a good book, but it said it was in a ""like new"" condition and it showed up with half the cover missing. But that's alright. Who needs covers, right?"
4,Bob,Very interesting book. Well worth reading. The fact that it was edited by the enemy (U.S. Army)before publication makes me wonder if some things are not glossed over.
4,A good short read.,If you are a Native American History Buff you will enjoy. This is a quick read that gives a good idea of the mind set of Geronimo
5,Good book,I love that direct quotes are used and this was not written as a summary. Its a very good book. Enough?
3,They will leak,These batteries will do the job for which they are intended. However I have found in my application that they leak severely after 2-3 years. This could damage sensitive electronic components.
5,Enersys Cyclon 2V 5AH battery,"Replacement for old cell. Perfect match in form, fit and function. Item was exactly as described and was shipped promptly."
2,Bought them for the name,"We had a party for Mary Jane, but the candy itself is not that good. Highly recommended for a Mary Jane named party as a decoration"
5,Le Creuset Mortar & Pestle,This product arrived timely & in great shape!Thank you so much!Kathleen S Vaccaro
5,Awesome !,"The most detailed book on Isma'ilis - the best unbiased, factual and complete book on Isma'ilis out there."
3,"Good read, but not very scary","While the storyteller does an excellent job of weaving 2 seperate plots, he leaves out one important factor. The villian wasn't scary. The villian has to be like a horrible car accident. While it makes your insides shudder and crawl, you still can't look away. All the reviews for this book compare the villian, Horridus, to Hannibal the Cannibal. Not even close. Looking into Hannibal's soul was like looking into a snakes eyes. You are completly mesmorized and cannot look away, even when you know the danger that lurks within them. Don't get me wrong it was a good read but it won't keep you up at night."
4,Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick,"A previous reviewer wrote, ""Please don't waste your time or money on this one.""Re the latter, I use the local library exclusively for my books. Re the former, It was not a waste of time. It was a good read as were several other of Parker's books. Not a disappoint at all, not even close."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!,"But it's not THAT bad either! It was fine when i first started reading it, but then it started to get boring and boring; the boring part took me 2 months to finish it!!!! I didn't like it much, the story keeps repeating again and again, same thing happenes! nothing's new about it!!"
5,Intriuging,"I really enjoyed this book. The author is obviously extremely talented. This is one of those books that you start reading, and get drawn into. I would highly recommend this to most anybody."
4,Excellent read,"This was my first experience with this author, and I would recommend this book to everyone. It took me a full 2 weeks to finish, because I found myself not so engrossed in the story through the middle of the book. The final chapters of the book though kept me wanting to find out more. There were plot twists that were unforseeable, to me anyway. I was stupified a couple of times. The characters in this story were believable, although not memorable. Donna Mason, the main character's ""mistress"" was too supportive, it made me wonder if there was something she was hiding. Come on, no one is that nice!Over all I give this book a thumbs up and will put it on my to-read-again list."
5,Truly Incredible !,"I am a voracious reader, though in the last year I've had a horrible case of Reader's Block. This book literally ripped me right out of that dilemma.The character development is stunning and very believeable. The book delves into the heart of madness in such a way that makes you wonder if its madness is contagious.There are many subplots and wonderful twists and turns that keep you locked in a death grip with the pages. I am writing this review so I can ""move on,"" get out of its grip...The end made me weep as though it happened to me. A truly incredible work.Read the book. You'll have to write your own review to get it out of your head. Or maybe I should say, blood. I wish you luck ..."
4,T. Jefferson Parker always delivers,"I became a fan of Parker's by accident and now I actively look for his novels. Parker not only writes a compelling story, but he developers his characters with an eye to giving them characteristics that really draw you into the work. And of course in an era where we all know that black and white is gray, Parker's protagonists that are less than perfect are particularly attractive. In this novel, we can't help but cheer for the guy, after all he is every ones hero and going after a horrible villain helps. Parker's novel will keep you turning the pages and when you are done, you feel you learned something about yourself in the process. This novel is extremely well written and entertaining."
4,ChingChing99,"Good. Couldn't put it down. Grammatically, needs a lot of work. Misspelled words, bad punctuation, spelling that won't be found with spell checker. Needs better editing."
2,Where Serpents Lie,I didn't even finish reading it. The language was a turn off for me! I don't understand why authors think bad language makes a book good to read.
2,"This book had potential, or so I thought","I've never read Parker before, so I thought I'd start out with this one. I'm glad I did, because despite of how little I liked this one I've since read a couple of his other books I've liked more.Where Serpents Lie should have been great but it wasnt'. I just couldn't believe the story line, either one of them.Please don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,MULTIPLE GRAMMATICAL ERRORS IN BOOK.,"This book has MULTIPLE errors in spelling, grammar, and even several places where a completely wrong word is inserted. All the T. Jefferson Parker books I've read are this way. The stories are great but there obviously is not proof reading involved.Best story yet though the errors really take away from the enjoyment of the story."
5,Murder and mayhem at its best!,Downloaded this book as I'm a sucker for a murder mystery. This is my first T. Jefferson Parker book and I was pleasantly surprised. Flawed but relatable hero pulled the story together. Would definitely recommend!
3,"Great price, got what I paid for.","Great price! Jacket wet with condensation when received, one sleeve was faded & brown compared to the other. Basically, I got what I paid for."
1,"Okay, but not for me","This jacket was a good price so I decided to try it. But, when I tried it on, I decided it was a little too purple and just not what I was looking for."
2,Size charting wrongly described,"I ordered 26/28 size,and i got that only,but i measured it ,it came out 30/32 ,and it was too big for me.I have to return the item,also the way it looked nice on site,it is rather dull otherwise...."
4,Speedy,The item came sooner than I expected and was exactly as advertised. I would definitely do buisness with them.
5,Awesome,"It was perfect. The lines are great, it's very flatering, and the sleves are long enough that they can fit anyone given a bit of tailoring."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!,"This is a great book. I liked it because it seems as though it could really happen. It was just so wonderful. As soon as I was done reading it I wanted to be just like Harry. My teacher said to read it so I did. Once I did I just couldn't stop. It was soooo good!It has owls, and rats, and cats Oh, my. Andy and company gives it two thumbs up!"
5,This book was REALLY good!,"I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone because everyone else in my reading class was reading it. I am now glad I did, because this book was awsome! I know that many people reccomend this book to all their friends, and I know that I will. I love how the book was very relistic for a fantasy, and how the characater's were very real. READ THIS BOOK!"
5,Arguments against some poor reviews,"This review is mainly countering some of the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews I've seen: First, parents & teachers: Harry Potter dosen't encourage weightism: Dudley is not changed into a pig because he is fat, it is because of his clearly pig-like personality. His weight is just a detail. Second, H.P. dosen't encourage rule-breaking-Hermione, one of the bravest people in the book, is very concerend about both grades and rules. In the book it says that one of the main attributes of Slytherin (house of Harry's greatest enemies)is breaking rules, therefore putting it on the ""evil side."" And besides, what's a good book with out rule breaking- some of the time! Loosen up and read for fun!"
5,Wonderful book!,I thought it was a wonderful book! I couldn't put it down! I loved the way you never knew what was next.
4,Harry Potter Series,"My rating for this book, is for the whole series, not just one. It is a good adventure, great stuff for the youth. Just to worn you, there is some cusing in there for you who would like to know. The rest of the stuff is great, the story between good and evil, stuggles to do what is right.I just can't wait to see the third movie. It comes out June 4th 2004."
5,Harry Potter,"First, I think this book was too hard for me to read, because I don't know many English. But finally, last year, my teacher make me read it. When I start to read, it was really hard, but after 1 month, it was easy. After I finish this book, I learn much more English than the past. It help me a lot, I love it.This book was about a boy, who name Harry Potter, lost his dad and mom. And he had to live with his aunt and uncle. Then he find out that he was a wizard. He go to the wizard and which school. And he got a lot of adventure there, he face the one who kill his mom and dad.To find out what happen to him, read the Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone!"
3,Harry Potter poses as the new young hero for students.,"Harry Potter strays from the most recent genres of normal young adult literature heroes by taking students back to fiction and dreamland. Students will have a difficult time identifying with this character since his world is so unrealistic. Potter is a fun & different character who comes from extraordinary circumstances. Harry doesn't allow these circumstances to make him snobbish toward anyone, instead he tries to befriend all."
5,The Best Book Ever,I went to camp and everyone was reading this series so i decided to try it. I am glad I did. This Harry Potter book is my favorite book in the entire world. It is just the best and cleverest book ever written.
4,"I must say, this is a very good book series.","This book series is almost as good as the chronicles of Narnia. I am reviewing the whole series of Harry Potter. The story and such is not the best, but for some of the things that are out there, it is superb. Overall, a highly enjoyable piece of literature. Recommended to anyone who can read, even if you are not into the genre of fantasy."
5,Awesome,"nuff said, if you're a fan, you're a fan, if you're not, you don't know what you're missing."
5,The Best Harry Potter Book,I thought this book was great. Harry's parents were killed by Lord Voldemort but he lived somehow. He went to live with his Aunt and Uncle Dursley. The Dursleys have a son named Dudley which always picks on Harry. Harry keeps on getting letters about a wixard school named Hogwarts. Harry meets a bunch of people which some become his friends. Read this book and you will see what happens to Harry and his friends. I like this book because I think the first book is the best book.
4,Harry is witty and clever...for all ages,"I think this book is wonderful. I am 22 years old, and was completely impressed with the witty names, situations and events that happen in the story. Rowlings sarcastic humor is refreshing and her writing style keeps you turning page after page. Great book for any one who wants a lighthearted mystery."
3,Ole Miss EDEL620 Review,"Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone, the first novel in the Harry Potter series, by J. K. Rowling, was intriguing. Because of its mystery and imaginative style, it is a book that can be enjoyed by any age group. The story entices the reader with tales of adventure intertwined with the constant battle between good and evil. Reading the novel it was easy to recall the frustrations associated with meeting new people and adjusting to new social settings. The book leaves you eager to continue the journey in the sequels that follow."
5,It was a magical book that people of all ages will want to r,"The book Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a great book. It is about a boy named Harry Potter. Harry lives with his aunt and uncle and their awful son Dudley. Harry is abused and hated. But all that is about to change. When Harry turns eleven he discovers a magical secret his aunt and uncle never wanted him to find out... It is a great book and I recomend it to anybody, young or old."
5,The best children's author ever!!!!!!!!!!,This book blew me away! It's number 1 on my booklist. I hope that this becomes a great series!
4,A very exicting novel of magic and wizards,"HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is one exciting novel. The novel is about a boy named Harry Potter, who thought he was a normal person, but who soon finds out he's actually a wizard. Then suddenly from a disliked boy he turned to a famous person. As time goes by, at Hogwarts, the school for wizards, Harry Potter discovers alot of secrets. He found out the secret of the Sorcer's Stone that deals with the person who killed his parents. The story gets more and more exciting towards the end. I highly recommand this novle to people of all ages who like exictment."
5,"Wonderful. A realistic, scintillating story.",Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is wonderful. It is catchy and realistic. You become completely caught up in the adventures of Harry and his friends.
4,You don't need to be a kid to enjoy this book!,"Ever miss reading a book that is light hearted but still adult enough for you not to feel silly reading it? Then pick up a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone and you will find yourself a fan of the series. I read this book and had to order the second through fourth one after finishing it. It's so hard to put it down.If you enjoy classic wizards and witches stories with English style writing (trust me, it's funny!) then you should consider picking up this book. It will make you thirst for more."
5,A great book to read to your family,"This is a wonderful book! I just finished reading it to my entire family. (Even my husband didn't miss a reading session!) We all loved it!What saddens me, though, is reading an article today from the Los Angeles Daily News stating how parents from several school districts in CA are trying to ban Harry Potter from school libraries and classrooms. One parent stated that she is even working toward a ""censored book list.""We have so homogenized what is available to our children that it is no wonder so few children leave anything to imagination anymore. Ask a child today to make up something, and you're bound to get something related to what they've seen on a Saturday morning TV show.This book is a wonderful, fantasy-based book that lets the reader's imagination soar right along with it. Our family is looking forward to reading the further adventures of Harry Potter!"
5,The best book I have read in 15 years!,Harry Potter is an excellent book! I am hooked! I am reading the third book now and several fellow workers are reading right along with me. I don't know what I will do until the fourth book comes out. I hope it will be released soon. This is an excellent book for fifth graders and up. One of the teachers here at the school is reading it to the fifth grade class and we participated in the Harry Potter Magical Candy Contest Harry Potter is spreading like wildfire! I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Brilliant book for 10/11 year olds - boys and girls!!,This book has kept my Grade 5 class enthralled all year. It is the incentive I use for everything in my classroom - 15 minutes of 'Harry Potter' - they all crave it (and this it when given a choice between 15 minutes of computer time or a no-homework night or 15 minutes of reading 'Harry Potter'!!!) We have just finished the first book and are starting the second. They are all hoping that there are more books on the way. I will be encouraging them to send their own reviews in very soon. Congratulations on a truly terrifc book! Is there any way the students can write directly to Ms. Rowling?
5,It is Fantastic!,I think this book is so creative and I think the charactors have great personalities.You would love the part when Harry meets Hagrid
5,Love love love it!,"Not only is J.K. Rowling's story amazing, Jim Dale does an incredible job with each character's voice. I have since listened to all 7 books and he maintains the integrity and quality to each character throughout! I have also read all the books too, but it is a good way to pass the time on long trips with a nice English accent!"
5,Exstordanary Magic!!!!,I would give this book five stars because the way J.K. Rowling writes it seems like your in another world. the auther writing is so brillant because when you read it the words in the book let you see it the writing like pictures except their are no pictures of anything in the book.......!!!!!!!6th grader from Maine.
5,Delightfull writing for any age.,"Rowling's prose is transparent in the sense that the reader forgets about reading and enjoys the story. In my view, many contemporary authors let the writing get in the way, as if it has become more important than the story itself. This is an enjoyable read for anyone."
2,Go for the paperback,"Sadly disappointed by this book. Everyone who'd be interested in a collector's edition will already know the story, so I'm not going to bother with a plot summary. This book is seriously overpriced for what it costs to actually produce it--but then, they're milking wallets like crazy.I found that the leather binding was rather funny-looking, the illustration had somehow been altered in a way that was VERY unappealing, and the picture of Harry by Rowling somehow... uh... it just didn't make me feel any less odd about it. I don't have a problem with, say, the leather-bound LOTR volume because they bothered to make it more worth the money.I'd advise that either you take the advice of the other reviewer and get it from the UK (where people apparently don't get quite so milked for their merchandise) or buy several paperback copies. It's not worth seventy little ones just for a semi-nice cover."
1,harry potter and the sorcerers stone,this book is probably the worst book i will ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it took me weeks to finish this book. the words are to small and the is as thick as my head. this book is for people with bad taste in books.
1,RACIST,"SO I SUPPOSE THE POINT OF THIS BOOK IS THAT PEOPLE WHO WEAR TURBANS ARE EVIL??? THERE ARE NO MINORITIES IN THE BOOK AND HARRY ""THE WHITE BOY"" POTTER SAVES THE DAY THIS BOOK IS RACIST AND SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BUT NO PEOPLE READ AND THE ONLY GIRL IN THE STORY IS PORTRAYED AS A NERDY BOOKWORM SIDEKICK BUTT KISSER REAL GOOD PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN WASNT IT WRITTEN BY A WOMAN??? THIS BOOK IS STUPID AND RACIST AND DONT BUY IT"
1,not impressed,"I picked this book up (from my kids) because, while reading reviews of the Twilight Saga, it was constantly being compared (unfairly, in my opinion) to HP. I have seen and LOVED all the HP movies, and consider myself an HP fan, but, this first book is a major disappointment.I was expecting much better writing, more descriptive story telling and better characters. I am not finished with the book yet, and I will finish it, but I am not too sure I will finish the series.To be fair, my 10 year old did tell me it was kinda boring, but he has read it 3 times... maybe I need to introduce him to the rest of my library! It has some fabulous fantasy in it. MUCH better than this.This is the rare case where the movies are FAR superior to the books."
1,bad book,"It was very unrealistic, and some of the scenes came out of nowhere, and there were chapter cuts where there should not have been chapter cuts, and that's all I have to say."
4,Reveiw of Sorcers stone (book one),Harry Potter is a book for those who still have an imagination. One of my friends read the book and she hated it because she doesn't have the imagination. I personally loved the book. It had very good details so I could actually put myself in the place of the main charecters. I felt the pain of Harry's losses and when he fell I fell to.When he triumphed I felt like I was a part of it. I didn't give it 5 stars because then the book would have had to be satifying to all my senses. It missed only one! My smelling sense and it is very hard for a book to deliver that to a person.
3,Excellent Except...,"We are enjoying the Harry Potter series of books but inspite of the excellent stories and overall good writing, we have one major concern. Young readers want to believe in magic and dragons and wizards and such. If they are not prepared to understand that Magic, in this sense is a myth and all in fun, they may be encouraged to seek magical experiences through the occult which is the closest reality to the magic presented in the Harry Potter books. There is of course a very real spiritual dark side, only to anxious to initiate our young people into the ""secrets"" of witchcraft and supposed power over others. With this understanding, they are very enjoyable fiction."
1,pottermore?,"I thought maybe I'd read the book, until I had to create a second profile to buy this for my Kindle. That's about the worst user experience I can imagine. Forget it."
2,A Disappointment,"Where a bunch of FOOLS gave this movie five stars, I speak ofthe truth. J.K. Rowling LAVISHED some cheap imagination in the makingof this book. I can name at least ten predictable parts in this book. I just don't understand how this book made it big. Many parts of it are laughable, questionable, and just confusing! The book has too much imagination and BULL in it! Come on people, get the point!Finally, the second Harry Potter book is better, three stars, but that doesn't mean that's a fascination either."
1,Harry potter and the sorcerers stone,GOOD!!!!!!! I really liked this book.....the style of writing was good. Awesome twist at the end of a good book!
2,HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE,HE LIVE WITH ANUT THEY LOCK HIM IN THE CUPBARD IF HE WAS BAD. HE KEPT GETTING LETTER FROM SOMEONE BUT HARRY WANTED TO KNOW WHO WAS WRITTING TO HIM.BUT HIS ANUT WOULDN'T LET HIM HAVE IT.
3,Rob your children of their childhood!,"You want your children to cast spells on each other? That is what happens in this book, oh sure the tards out there are always whining about everything else but not harry potter. Some kids in Turkey cast spells on each other and one ended up getting third degree burns. Is this how you want your kids to learn to cast magic? Not a safe book, they would be better of learning from an old John Christopher novel or something."
3,Dreadfully Dissapointing,"I was very dissapointed in Harry Potter. With all the rage about it. It was an okay book, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't as thrilling as I'd expected. I found the story to move along far too slowly. It took forever just to get to the point!"
5,What a BRILLIANT Book!!!,"This book is the best book that I have ever in my entire life read!!!! This book was so enchanting that I got into such a lot of trouble at school from not being able to put it down, that I had to sneak it under my desk to read. It was eventually confiscated and I only got it back at the end of the week after my teacher had finished reading it!!!!!!"
5,My Childhood,I freely admit to being part of the 'Harry Potter' generation. Passing on a copy of this book just makes me grin.
1,harry potter and the sorcerer's stone,i hate this book itis way too scary for me and the girls in the book are not realistic and they talk stupidly. i would never reccomend this book to anyone 10 or older even though i am 8 and would never read the rest of it.(even though i only read ten chapters). they have too much scary scenes in it and not much details so no pictures pop up in my head. every time i read the book i get scared and can't sleep at night. i always have to sleep witht he night light on or sleep with my mom. it would never be a book that i like.
1,I SAY I DO NOT LIKE POTTER THAT MUTCH MATE,"I dislike Harry Potter. I think that it is frightfully priposterous. There is more magic in the coriidor, mate. So yes I donot agree. So it is frightfully odd."
1,Poorly styled prose unreadable,"I am a person who loves good literature, including good fantasy writing. I have read and enjoyed Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitzin, but also love The Lord of the Rings, and other fantasy works by the likes of Stephen R. Donaldson and Philip Jose Farmer, for example.When my wife became an avid ""Potter fan"" I decided to give this book a try, but I found the prose style so dreadful that I was unable to continue beyond the first chapter. Whatever this series has to recommend it as far as the story goes (I watch the movies to keep up with that, and they are pretty entertaining), the writing itself is unforgivably poor. Most creative writing students that I spoke with about it at Fresno State agree with me, as well. This makes me think that Harry Potter is mostly read by people with limited experience with literature, as is the case with my wife, for example. If you never listen to Beethoven, Vivaldi, or Mahler, you won't recognize good from bad attempts at ""classical"" music."
3,"Good, but not as good as other books I've read","My mother read me this at bedtime. I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't the best book I've ever had read to me at bedtime. Other, better books include The Hobbit, by J. R. R. Tolkien, and The Last Battle, by C. S. Lewis. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was exciting and I kept trying to guess what would happen, which was fun. But it wasn't at all scary or shivery, though it was sad that Harry's mother and father were dead, and that someone I liked was on Voldemort's side. I liked the magic bits, but Narnian magic seemed much more real. Also I didn't believe some of Harry Potter, like the defeat of the troll; it seemed too easy peasy lemon squeezy. But I liked it enough to read the next one."
1,All I can say is disappointed,This book does not live up to the hype. I've been told that it is the best of the series and if that's true I cringe at having to read the others. And they only keep getting LONGER!
5,Wonderful Books,I think that all three of these books were great and would advise anyone to read them. I could'nt put it down. She draws you in till you finish the book and can't wait to srart the next one. I have read all three books and can't wait to read the next one. I think that J.K. Rowlings did a great job of writing them. And I think that older people can enjoy these books too. I'm 19 Years old and enjoyed them Very much. I havn't read anything this good in a while.I think they are well worth there money and time. I say read them!!!
5,If there was an option for 10 stars that's what I would give,"I am a graduate student and had to read the book for a class. I started it yesterday and stayed up late into the night to finish it. I don't understand why anyone would want to keep this book from children. The book had mystery, suspense, action, humor, and morals. What more could a kid ask for?I kept hearing all this hooplah surrounding the book, and I couldn't figure out why. Now I know. It's a tremendously entertaining read, and it reminds me of the books I loved to read when I was a kid. I'm not embarrassed to admit this, but I'm eager to read the next books in the series. Me, a college student...."
5,I couldn't put the book down.,This book came highly reccomended to me and I am glad that I had the opportunity to read it. I have enjoyed the book very much......I am anxious to read the second book.
5,Great Book!,"I find the Harry Potter books fascinating. I have always had a wonderful imagination and still do at 25. I have always been an avid reader and heard mention on the radio about some of the controversy surrounding the books. So naturally, my curiousity was fueled and I was out purchasing the book that evening, I finished it soon thereafter and purchased the 2nd and 3rd book immediately. If anyone thinks these books could desensitize children or corrupt them, then they are truly wrong and should not pass judgement until they have actually read the books. It fuels a childs imagination which seems to be deteriorating over time, parents should be happy to see their child reading a book. Do people think that the 'Wizard of Oz' books are evil? desensitizing? or corruptive? NOT ME! I have the whole collection. Come on get w/the program dust off your imagination people! Come be a child w/dreams again. While your doing that, I am off to read #4...may take awhile. =)"
5,"Great Book, that is not just for kids!","I'll admit, I was one of the thousands of adults that thought Harry Potter books were kids books and that I would not enjoy them. But after hearing friend after friend pick up these books and enjoy them, I thought I would give them a try.I am sure glad that I did. From the opening of the Sorcerer's Stone, I was taken to a world of wizards and witches. The writing was very easy to read, but there were some story lines that were very interesting. This was a book that took me to a different place, Hogwarts. It was great ways to take your mind off the stresses of life and read a happy story about a young boy making his dreams come true.This was a good book for all ages, and I highly recommend it to everyone!"
4,Very good book.,Thoroughly enjoyed. It has a good story and lots of very interesting characters. Would recommend to both children and adults.
5,Enchanting!,"As a Grandmother of a seven year old and a nine year old who have thoroughly enjoyed discovering Harry Potter, I decided to meet him also. What a treat. Not only is the writing great but there is a real moral thread throughout. Responsibility and loyalty are just two of the character traits demonstrated in a very entertaining manner. My only reservation is that some younger children might find the evil scenes overwhelming. Parents might want to preview the book before reading it to their little ones."
4,Impressed Despite Misgivings,"Harry Potter has been the rave for some time, and I tend to avoid top sellers, because the few times I have broken down and tried to read one, I have been burned.Harry Potter has blown me away.They are not a difficult read, but they are a good read. It is a simple story, and reads in a similar style to such books as, ""BFG"", ""Matilda"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"".It is a rare childrens book that does not over simplify it's language or ideas for children. And this is one such book.I think it is very appropriate for children of all ages, (including us over sized ones). It is Ideal for a bedtime story, because the parents should get as much enjoyment as the children.So I say, Harry Potter impressed me, despite my misgivings."
5,I am 10 and I can't put it down!,"I love this book and so does my brother.I think everyone should read this WONDERFUL book. some people say ""It has to much violence"" or ""It teaches kids it's okay to do something wrong. Well, I have only one thing to say to them: HELLO! Practicly everything today has violence and teaches kids bad stuff, but.... kids need at least some imagination and if we can't have that I'd rather not be apart of this cruel world!"
5,A Fantastic Book...Read it!,"The book Harry Potter, written by J.K Rowling, is one of the best books that I have read. The mystery of the mystical magic is one of the best parts about this book. I like the way the characters go through the dangerous and magical journeys. The book made me feel like I was there. It felt like I was following Harry everywhere he went. For somebody who doesn't like books, I really like this one."
3,Same as US,Anticipated more of an English flair to the writing but pretty much follows the U.S. version. Glad I only purchased the first book and not the set.
5,Great way to start a series,I wish I had read this sooner. It was a fun read even for someone who does not usually like reading. Can't wait to read number two! :D
3,Why all the hype?,"I will admit that I enjoyed this book. But it was like mashed potatoes, a comfort food. It had no real substanince or flavoring. It was quite a bit too meandering for my taste, and while it had some good charicters, I found most of them to be rather stuck up and boaring. This is deffinitley not even in the realm of good books. It was a quick read, and not that good."
3,harry,"My cousin reads these books and has a big picture on her wall of him. I paged through one book and forgot which one it was. These books are good, since they are encouraging children to read and use their minds instead of them watching Nickelodeon and other TV garbage and rotting their brains until they turn to mush. But, aren't these books a bit overhyped?"
4,"Weird people, weird things","Well this book is really quite good, so are the others in the series; I especially liked Chamber of Secrets. My feelings about each bookSorcerer's stone: Great for the opening, quite good at setting up the basic elements of the book and pushing an open path for the other books.Chamber of Secrets: BEst! iT IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER, FEAR AND DARKNESS. Yet the parts about Lockhart are really fun. It has so much adventure and has so much action, with such vivid descriptions.Prisoner of Azkaban: Deeply moving, how Harry feels about his dead parents and brings his father to life within himself, the horrible characteristics of the Dementors. This one has the ability to play on and connect to your emotions, producing the deepest impact.Goblet of Fire: Good all around, exciting new plot, great work at showing character in people.Keep it up J.K. Rowling!"
5,Tommy Smith Amazing Book Harry Potter,I thick it is good.But it sounld be more real.The three headed dog is dum.It sounld be a one headed dog.The cloak is cool.
5,Fantastic Read,Very entertaining and imaginative from start to finish. Looking forward to the rest of the books and while he getting them immediately.
5,3rd grade love,"when this came out i had instantly fallen in love with the book, being the age as an up and becoming wizard you cant help but wonder if on your eleventh birthday a giant will come take you away, you find yourself fantasizing about different creatures and powers that you wish you had, truly mesmorizing for a first time author"
4,HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE,"harrry potter and the sorcerer's stone is an amazing book to read the movies caught my attention so i had to read the book. Iam not going to say anything about it, if you read it i guaeantee that you will like it."
5,LLLLLOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE IT,The Harry Potter series is the best series ever. It has the coolest things and the most interesting events that you could ever imagine happening. It was such a good book and the rest of the serries is great to. So join the millions of people and start reading
5,Magical,I am as enchanted by this book now as I was when I first read it at age 12. My love of reading can be traced back to this story. I recommend it to anyone age 11 to 111.
5,Wow!,"An amazing book! It keeps you hooked through the last page! Makes you want to read the rest of the books as you follow Harry, Ron and Hermione through their fist year at Hogwarts. A suprise ending keeps you wondering how Rowling got her ideas."
2,"Kudos to the promoter, not the author","I can quickly name five to ten other far superior children's fantasy series. Credit should go to the publisher and publicist for selling this book. The language is flat. The characters very predictable. Where's the tension, emotion? I was relieved to see the abridged version of this and the two sequels for sale on CD. Clearly this shows that people really don't enjoy reading these books and are too afraid to speak up. If they listen to the CD's they will know enough about the characters, plot,etc to converse with others so they don't seem so of the loop. Has Ms. Rowling ever developed a paragraph longer than 6 sentences? Perfect for today's short attention span."
5,My review,I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a really good book. It has a lot of imagination in it
5,AMAZING,I absolutely love this book!! It has great plots and a fantastic world you can live in (in your mind that is)!!
4,Great for kids,This is a Good book for children or anyone to enjoy over and over again you always find new things
4,Potter fantastic,"I love this book. One of my favorites! Harry Potter is the best. My favorite is the fourth book, but all are great."
3,Harry potter,Very good book this is must read bookReally interesting and captivating! Makes you want to read more and more!
5,I've read this 5 times and it's one of the best books ever!,"I have read all the Harry Potter books and I think there the best books... After reading #1 5x, #2 3x, #3 3x, and #4 2x I'm still not bored of them. I look forward to #5 and hope it will be as good as the first 4. And another thing. Harry Potter is not 'Evil' or any thing. I mean I go to church and all and this is fanasy not witchcrarft... Anyways, if u like the Hobbit or like the Left Behind seris then ull love this. C ya."
5,A wonderful family read,"I was aware of some of the controversy surrounding this series and so decided to read it to my children myself, rather then letting my 8 and 10 year old read it alone. I am very glad I did. The story is captivatng from the start, and we all enjoyed it thouroughly.We took plenty of pauses and breaks to let the storyline sink in, stopping to discuss what was happening and why, and what we thought might happen next. My kids loved the challenge, and I liked watching them mentally engaged,their minds working. No one was bored. The storyline is fairly complex, with many characters and subplots.I strongly suggest this book be read as a family. We can't wait to start the next."
5,A book for the ageless readers!,"I've just completed reading ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", and yes, I'll confess, I've past my childhood ages for a long time, and now proceeding towards middle age, and still, I feel that I've been pushed back in time, toward my forgotten childhood, when the world was full of mystery and endless magic! J.K. Rowling has amazing inventive authority in gripping a reader's attention with such commanding lyrical voices in her story, a reader's age becomes irrelevant. I was hooked to the book from the very first sentence, couldn't take my eyes off the book till the fascinating end. I heartily recommend Harry Potter to everyone. Let's have little magic in all of our ""Muggle"" lives."
5,An extremely good novel by J.K Rowling,"Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone by J.K Rowling is one of the best novels I have read in a long time. Harry Potters parents were killed by ""You Know Who"", and now he lives with his mean Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and Dusley a chubby, whiny, mean boy. Harry gets a letter from the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardy. During his first year at Hogwarts, Harry meets Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasley and all of Rons brothers. But he also meets a nasty bunch Malfoy, Crabb, and Goyle. What will happen during his first year at Hogwarts?"
5,Loved it,Even though I've already seen the movies I still really enjoyed reading this book!It was a really easy read too. This was a great book to read for the first time on my new kindle.
4,A good start to a good series.,"This is the beginning to a great series that will take the world(literally) by storm. As 11 years old, the young Harry finds out he is a wizard starting a chain of events that will threaten not only Harry's life but the entire wizard and muggle world.This is a good book that most definitely needs to be on your shelf."
5,Still my favorite,"Of the entire Harry Potter series, this is still my favorite one. Rowling created an entire new world, which is so vivid. I didn't start reading the Potter books until I was in college. So this is for children and adults. If you're looking for a book to read to your kids, this is it!"
5,Harry Potter Year 1,"I usually like to read books with girl characters, so at first, I wasn't sure about reading Harry Potter. I was wrong. I read Harry Potter and it was great. One of Harry's best friends, Hermione, is a girl. His other friend is a boy, Ron. Also, the book was scary and had non-stop action. I've also recently read the second Harry Potter book and it's great too. I give them both 5 stars!"
5,Absolutely magical... for all ages,"Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry weave a captivating tale of mischief and mystery. Since this is the first in a series, it is dialogue-driven and the story really progresses fast. However, Ms. Rowling is such a great author that there are surprises around every corner. This book is full of nothing but good. It is a quality book and teaches children the basic good versus evil conflict. This is a must read for every American who has ever dreamed to reach above the ordinary."
4,Pleasantly Pleased,"I resisted reading this book, having seen all the movies (which I loved.) It's easy to see why it became such a hit with young readers - easy to read, but not childish. Great imagery. Obviously the beginning of an epic story. I'll plunge in and read the rest!"
5,Harry Potter RULES!,"Our teacher just finished reading this book to us in school......AND IT ROCKS! In basic, it's about a boy who lived with an uncle, an aunt, and a spoiled-rotten cousin who all detest him...(deep breath) for the first eleven years of his life. Then he starts getting mystery letters, is visited by a huge giant named Hagrid, and before ya know it, he's enrolled in a school of wizardy and witchcraft called Hogwarts. I thought this book was AWESOME, and I CANT WAIT to read the next two books. If you like fantasy, magic, and have read the Chronicles of Narnia, this book will give a jumpstart to your day. READ IT!"
5,A great book for THE CHILD WITHIN ALL OF US!,"I will be the first to admit that I'm 30 yrs old and I love Harry Potter. It doesn't matter how old or young you are-if you can open your mind just a bit and want to believe in a little magic, you'll love this series and Harry Potter in particular. We have all at one time or another been the underdog, the person faced with insurmountable odds-this is the story of one such person and how he deals with everything life seems to throw at him. JK Rowling has created a magical world that is extremely creative, fun, mysterious and leaves you wanting more. I look forward to reading the rest of this truly imaginative series!"
5,Great Book for 4th grade and up,All the Harry Potter books are good books for children to read. The most appropriate age I believe to be is 4th grade. They will not glamorize or idealize the liftstyle portrayed in the book. A younger child might have a hard time seperating real life from fiction. The books are easy to read and will hold your interest throughout. You should read the series. If you do not start with the first one you will not be lost as the author explains everything.
5,I wish I could have read something this good when I was 11!!,"I am 22 years old, and this book is so well written that I do not feel at all weird about reading it. I have a day care and all my children, ranging from 8-13, constantly ask me to read this to them. I have read these two books about five times a piece. That doesn't even count the amount of times I have read them myself. This series of books is bound to stay on the best of all times lists with others like Charlotte's web and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I am so glad I have purchased these books, they will stay with me until they have fallen completely apart. I can't wait to purchase number three!!!!!!!"
5,I Love This Book,I loved this book. I was instantly hooked as soon as I started reading it. I would recomend this series to evereyone who enjoys a great read.
5,AMAZING,Totally worth it i absolutely loved and i lov reading it on my kindle u should really think about getting this book
4,Harry potter:),Really good ;) i loved it it was so good I read it in three days now reading the secound one
5,A definite must read,"My kids insisted that I read the book before going to see the movie. So, I purchased it and half-heartedly started reading it. In less than 4 hours I had devoured this book! I could absolutely not put it down. I immediately rushed out to find the next volume and read that with equal fervor. I highly recommend this to all ages. As soon as he is old enough, I will be reading this to my grandson!"
5,Muggles Beware,"It seems like some people just don't get the Harry Potter novels, and never will. The book aptly names these people Muggles. They refer to these books as hype or dangerous fantasy. They despair over the poor innocents that will be impaired by this book in some way. They fail to see that this story is the introduction to a wonderful world, every bit as fully realized as Lewis's Narnia with characters as memorable as Dahl's Matilda, and James and the Giant Peach. The only way Harry Potter could impair someone is by giving them a love for reading."
5,amazing,"I am amazed on how well J.K Rowling has put this book together. I have read the series many, many times and I am shocked every time how everything is placed just in the right spot at the right time. It's very subtle looking at the big scheme of the books, but it's there telling you more about what's going on and what might happen. It keeps you on your toes without it being too much for you to take in. She has done a brilliant job setting up the series with this book. You are really depriving yourself of a beautiful piece of art if you don't read this masterpiece."
3,Diane Duane's Wizard series is much better,"Nothing new here. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone iswell-written and engaging, but there is nothing original here. Harrycould just as well be any of many super-youths unaware of their power and heritage, such as Wort or Luke Skywalker. The plot is predictable.Much better is the Wizard series (So You Want to be a Wizard, etc.) by Diane Duane."
3,so,"On some of my reviews i stated that the Harry Potter books were poorly written, but thats just because i have resad better fantasy books... Like books by Robert Jordan and Jrr Tolkien. The Harry Potter books are not as good as those books. I also said that the Dreaming Tree by C.J. Cherryh was better than than Harry Potter books, however, not all people may think so; but that is my opinion. Personally, I think The Wheel of Time and Lord of the Rings are better written. Other people may disagree, but, again, that is just my opinion. Read these if you want to and ,well, if you dont want to read the Wheel of Time and Lord of the Rings.{I am not saying the Harry Potter books are stupid or anything, but not all people have like them}"
3,this is an okay book,Harry Potter and the Sorcer's StoneI have just recently read this book and I didn't really care for it. I think that it would make a great children's book though. I didn't like the story that much because I like sport stories the most because I am a sports kid. Out of all the adventure stories that I have read so for Harry Potter has probably been the best. Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone is about a boy and his parents die and Harry Potter goes to a wizard school. Harry has to protect the school and keep a guy named Voldemore from taking over the school. The climax of the story is when Harry Potter fights Voldemore and tries to get the stone back to help the school.
3,Morally Decrepit,I have read many editorial reviews praising this series and must conclude that J.K. Rowling has created some inventive childrens' literature here...however I would not recomend this series to descerning parents who might find its themes and moral decrepitude dangerous for young children.
5,Harry Potter dazzels the minds of young children.,"Harry Potter is an inspiration to minds of people all over the world. His magic and friends always pull him out of trouble. His best friend Ron Weasley always is with him when he needs to talk. His smart buddy Hermoine Granger is sometimes giving him spells to get out of trouble. Hagrid showed him fluffy the guard dog. Then Harry, Ron, and Hremoine go into the chamber and find He Who Is Not To Be Named, and...... Read this extraordinary book to find things out of this world."
2,harry potter and the sorcerers stone,i really did not like this book! it was really boring for me!YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"This is the best I've ever read, it is excellent!","Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone book is the best. It is a excellent book, with a great story line. My favorite charchter is Malfoy, just kiddig. I like Harry and Nieville. This book is awsome I advise everyone to read this book. J.K. Rowling is a grea writer. Read this this book. It doesn't matter How old you are I'm 7th grade Ithink it is great!"
5,Great Book,"Love Harry Potter , I bought this book for my teenager who reads all the time.bought all the Harry Potter series but they had to be first editions. Great book better then the movie with lots more detail.."
4,Escapism for Adults,"Nearly 4000 reviews so I'll be brief. It's not just a kids book andthe hype is justified. In case you live in a cave or the moon.. Harry Potter small child parents dead lives with horrible relatives, gets invited to wizard school, makes friends and enemies, learns the wizard sport, has adventures.Should only take a few hours to read and you can spare that can't you?Any idea why the titles different (In England it is the Philosophers stone)"
4,Philosophers stobe,"Good book, had seen all the movies now reading them in order. Enjoyed the book very much. Now for next one"
3,poor packing,"i ordered a new book as a gift,so id like it to look new! the packaging itwas in bent the corners of the entire book and devalued its appearance. for that i could have ordered used and saved some money! the book was fine other than that."
4,A very good read.,I FINALLY got around to reading this after seeing all of the movies. I enjoyed it very much and I wish I had read them earlier as they came out.
5,Classic!,"Unfortunately, I did not read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone until after I had seen the movie. I thought everyone was just fussing over nothing, but after the movie, I decided if the book was better than the movie (which is usually the case), I have to read this book! I am so glad that I did. Rowlings's imaginative tale is a real page turner. I stayed up all night to read the entire thing because I simply could not put it down even though I already knew what was going to happen. The plot moves just as quickly as the movie but with fantastic description and great character development as well. I believe children and teens can definitely relate to the idea of trying to figure out exactly who you are and dealing with the past while trying to plan for the future. I believe this coming-of-age series will become a classic!"
4,Great Read,"I've been hesitant for YEARS to read this novel, but I finally bought and read it. I must say that the author impresses me quite a bit. JK Rowling really knows how to write a good story. It kept me interested and turning the pages. I admire and respect Rowling as an author, even if I don't respect her as a person for her careless and irresponsible marketing strategies. Anyway, I highly recommend this novel for its literary value. And, it's fun, for kids and adults."
2,STUPID!,"The storyline is pretty good. I do like the idea of a boy who knows nothing of what he is to become and how he will affect many people's lives just by living. But that has been overplayed too much. (Dune, Star Wars, both of which were ten times better.) He has friends with stupid names, teachers with stupid names and a lightning bolt on his forehead. (LOL)I don't understand the big deal about this book. by people who are for it or against it. No, I don't beleive that Harry is Satan, but I do beleive that this book is average and there should not be a big hype over it.I did like the ending. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to use everything that they had learned to face VOLDAMORT! VOLDAMORT! VOLDAMART! (I SAID HIS NAME) It was interesting, but boring.I'm going to go read my new Harry Harrison book and leave this one to [others].... I give this book, *Imprints a two over Harry's lightning bolt* a two. Have a nice day."
3,An okay book,"Really, though it's been on a craze, I could find many other books much better. The book is fun and all that, and I found it cool at first, but then I started to realize that they're a lot of other good books out there, but not as known. I kind of consider it a waste of time, but it's a good book."
2,Christians Beware.,"Harry Potter is an exciting book, full of twist and turns. But if you're a Christian reading this I advise you to not go further. It discourages witchcraft in the Bible. For those who are not Christians please look into it. I'm not forcing this upon you but just look in the Bible, especially Matthew. If you have an I-phone you can get it. If you have a computer look it up. Please."
5,Harry will have you amazed with his spectacular bravery.,"Harry, a humorous boy going to wizard school, experiences many great adventures in this spectacular story. It is very well written and can be enjoyed by anyone. The book is about a boy that after ten years discovers that he is a great wizard. He is sent to Hogwarts, a wizard school, to learn how to use his powers. But Harry doesn't know that he will face many troubles."
4,The amazing story of Harry Potter,I thought that this book was a very good book. The book is about a boy that finds out that he is a wizzerd. I think it was 1 of the best books written.It would be avery good book report.
4,Better late than never,I didn't think this series would be as fun as it has turned out to be. On to book two.
5,Harry Potter is a must read!!,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is an enchanting tale written by J.K. Rowling. Harry is a famous boy at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry was a baby his parents perished while he survived Voltmorts dreadful attack of his wand. Eleven years later he received a letter from Hogwarts. Harry wanted to go but his Aunt and Uncle forbidhim to go because they refused to believe in magic. Harry has two friends. One a girl, named Herminone Granger, andRon Weasly. They all try to find the sorcerers stone which can make anyone live forever. While on their quest they learn that together they can accomplish the task at hand. I enjoyed this lengthy tale of Harry Potter. This book kept me on theedge of my seat. I would recommend this book to all my friends."
4,"Great book, fun 2 read","Loved the book. I couldn't stop reading it once I had begun. Great for boys and girls and kids 8-15. A must have if you love fantasies, which I don't read that much(why the 4 stars)"
5,Amazing (:,I love it .(: it's truly an amazing book .if you haven't read it I strongly recommend it .(: it is one of my favorites .
5,The best series,This is one of the best series ever! :)I love how it keeps me on my toes and I never want to stop reading it!
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone,I found it very hard to put the book down. Even though I had seen the movie it was still exciting to be there and go through it even closer than just watching it on the screen.
3,Harry Potter,Harry Potter is a O.K. book. It wasn't the best I have ever read.The reason I rated it a three is because it was not my kind of book. I read the whole book becasue I thought it would get better but I didn't. Bet that still doesn't make it a bad book. I know a lot of people who like Harry Potter and fantasy type books. And i like real books. Like hatchet that is a based on a true story and that is why I liked that book. Also the River. So thats it.
3,harry potter and sorcerers stone,"This book was my least favorite out of all four. the first half of the book tells about who Harry is and how he became a wizard. A giant wizard named Hagrid takes Harry from his muggle aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. He then takes harry to Diagon alley and buys him all of his school supplies. Later on in the year Harry faces the Dark wizard Voldmort. Read the book to find out what happens."
5,harry potter,I think Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone is a very good book! It's about an eleven-year-old boy who finds out he is a wizard so he goes to Wizarding School. This book is very exciting and it's got a very exciting plot! There wasn't a boring part in the whole book. It's so exciting that after reading the first chapter I didn't want to put it down. I would highly recommend this book to men and women of all ages!
5,harry potter is the best!!,I read Harry Potter when it first came out. I loved it and recommended it to anyone who wanted to read a great book. I love Harry Potter and think it is the perfect book for children and adults. It takes you to a place that you have never been before. J.K. Rowling really knows what she is doing!!
3,"Pretty good, entertaining read","I don't hesitate to say that this book, along with the rest of the series, is a good read in general. It is engaging, enjoyable, and holds you until the end--just plain fun. I encourage you to read it just for the experience. However, I didn't really identify very much with Harry, though it's just me. I recommend the is book and its sequels, but for a truly wonderful childrens' series that adults can also enjoy, try John Bellairs' books."
5,Brandon's book review for Harry Potter,i think the best part in harry potter was when they are playing the flying games in the air that cool.i think the kids that like magic books then they would like harry potter it got a lot of cool stuff like finding thing geting in trouble and lots of other stuff that cool so if you like magic books then you read Harry Potter!!!!!!!!!!!
5,This is a very good book because our class read it.,I love this book because I read this book and I am reading the book and I am almost done and my mom wants me to read it to her.
4,Good,"This book is good. But the movie is better. Harry Poter's books are a little bit scary. This book is better than the second. This book is more interesting. You should read this book if you are Harry Poters fan, if you're not leave this book alone, it not going to be interesting for you!Trust me."
4,Pretty Good for a First Book,"I am far too old to be such a Harry Potter fan, but I am. I was not a major fan of this first book. I thought the writing was mediocre at best and the story line too choppy. What makes this book so good, and one you want -- need -- to finish is the character development. Almost from the beginning you're on Harry's side and wishing he could get away from his mean aunt and uncle, and when it finally happens and he's walking down Diagon Alley looking for ""school"" supplies with Hagrid...well, you're hooked. This series of book is, of course, geared towards young people, but they are much more than your average children's novel. Some of the themes of friendship, good vs. evil, family, and overcoming adversity are timeless themes, which will appeal to any reader -- young or old."
4,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, etal","The story is well written especially as if it is through the eyes of an 11-year old. The story is wordy at times and I found it slow to read. The story is enjoyable, but I do not understand the fanatical behavior that it prompted in the public. I certainly would not have been on lines at midnight to have purchase any of the books. It is good but not great."
5,the best book ever!!!!!!!!!,Harry potter is the best book ever I wish I was him. I can picture it in my head learning magic riding brooms. It can drive you mad wanting to read to the end of it. Alas i just turned 11 and school started so i am just a simple Muggle wich is annoying cause i wanted to ride a nimbus 2000. no not just that learning magic and geting a owl it sounds all to fun to even be allowed in a book. It's sad really well never see a quiddich game or a boy woth a lightning scar on his forehead. But then we might be able to I the movie. I can't what till i get the second then the third maybe the fourth perhaps the fifth i hope the sixth but defanatly the seventh.
4,Another dimesion of Harry Potter,"Jim Dale brings a lot to the story with the voices he gives the characters. Perfect for long car trips. Be sure to try the British version to, with Stephen Fry reading."
4,Very entertaining and pleasant read,"The story (now 3 stories) of Harry Potter and friends are really fun to read, and can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. If you like these, you SHOULD NOT MISS OUT on reading the 5 book series of Taran the Pig-keeper (The Book Of Three, etc) by LLoyd Alexander. It is truly a 5 star series."
4,Read da book luv da book yo!,"Yo who eva iz readin dis book should buy it if yall already haven't. This book is so interesting it has action parts, Inky parts and annoying parts. Just like any other book dawgs! Well most of them anyway.If your gonna read the first Harry Potter book then you have to read all of the other ones such as numbers, 2, 3, 4, and the newest one number 5! ... WELL MY DAWGS READ DIS BOOK BEFORE I MAKE U!"
4,"Mmmhh, very suspicious","Well, I have read a lot of Harry Potter stuff in internet, among the first three books, so I am doubtfully...DO THERTE ISNT ANYBODY IN THIS WORLD WHO HAVE NOTICED DE SUSPICIOUS SIMILITUDE BEETWEEN HARRY POTTER AN THE TV SHOW BASED ON THE BOKKS OF JILL MURPHY, THE WORST WITCH!!!!!You know, It have been quite a dissapointing time for me when I saw the show for first time, and I noticed the bunch of similitudes.Anyway, the book is great, and I strongly recomend it to all the people who wanna read an interesting, humorous and well writted book.Thanks, and e-mail me!!"
5,"Harry Potter, a fantastic series!",The Harry Potter series are the four best books I have ever read. I own all four and can't wait till the fifth comes out. The movie will be spectacular too. If you have not read these books you should really take the time to do it. You won't be sorry. J.K. Rowling takes you on an amazing journey through magic and mystery. These are the best books since the Nancy Drew series and are amazing. If you pass these books up you will regret it!
5,Potter,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is very entertaining, people who do not even read would be interested in these fictional novels. Mystery, death, wizards, it's a plethora of excitement! As soon as you start your adventure to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and wizardry. You will be captured in the magic by watching Harry's first day at school with friends to coming extremely close to expulsion. If you are a constant reader or someone who barely reads at all. Either way this book and all of the series are books to pick up."
5,J.K. Rowling Harry Potter,"This book is the one of the best books I have ever read. I am 14 years old and I'm going to buy it just so I know it's on my shelf, but also to read it over again! I borrowed it from a friend who's little sister's 3rd grade class read it, then her whole grade read it, then all the parents read it, and then the author was invited to Rosie O'Donnel! if you haven't read it, READ IT!"
4,"Good, but why change the title?","The Harry Potter books are good fun, well worth reading, and full of neat stuff (in a wizard's photographs, the people in the photograph don't just stand still: if they're busy they disappear, if they're pleased to see you they wave). Harry Potter isn't just some boring child-hero: he's real, he changes, he misses his parents... and he has neat friends.But why change the title? The original title was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone was an actual medieval concept - a substance that could make you immortal or change ""base matter"" into gold. The sorcerer's stone is completely meaningless - particularly as, unless they've changed the text of the novel too, the stone is referred to as the Philosopher's Stone throughout."
3,Tiresome,"My wife bought the first two Harry Potter books for me last Christmas because I had mentioned that I was interested in finding out what all the fuss was about. The answer? Not much. This is nothing more than an engaging, if shallow, tale about a misfit who makes good. Nothing different or more enlightening than any of a thousand other books already out there.Harry is a semi-likeable guy. He doesn't cause any grief or put anyone in terrible danger, and he's a hell of a Qwiddich player, but that's about it. The rest of the book is fairly standard fare, easily cribbed from any of a dozen other children's books from the last quarter-century."
5,Enchanting and engaging. This book is not just for kids.,"An enchanting story. J.K. Rowling creates magic in this tale of a young boy and his relationship with his adoptive family, friends (muggles and witches), and the discovery that he is famous. Engaging because the author mixes fantasy, monsters, witches and wizards with humor and the angst of being an eleven year old. We read this story aloud as a family. Our kids, boy 8 and girl 13 could not wait till story time. They both took turns reading. Try it."
5,GREAT BOOK,LOVED THIS BOOK AND RECEIVED IT IN GREAT SHAPE. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN ADVENTURE!!
5,"greatest book for kids, teens, and adults!",I am a 13 year old boy and i loved this book! it was great i was up all night reading it! it is such a wonderful story i can't wait to finish the series! j.k rowling is a great author and i can't wait for the movie and the rest of the series! You have to read this book you won't regret it
4,I'm the mom and I read the book first...,"As the mother of a precocious 9yo girl, I was amused to read in the news about parents wanting this series of books banned in schools. Being the mother that I am, that was pretty much enough to make me run right out and buy all three books for my daughter. I don't agree with the parents/readers that commented that the books are much to 'violent' for children to read. I would much rather my child read this book than watch the evening news anyday of the week. As her parent, I thought it was my job to discuss the world around us with her, not sheild her from it and have her be shocked by it when she reaches adulthood.I'll continue to read each book before her to ensure that it's something I am comfortable with her reading, because really, it should be MY choice, not the choice of a bunch of closed-minded people."
3,Harry Potter,"I'd say that this book is okay. The plot is fairly interesting and it is written decently. Overall, it's an okay book. It isn't a classic, but it's pretty good. For people who hate it and say it's absolutely fake and horrible, I would have to disagree. It isn't horrible, but it isn't outstanding either. What bothers me is when people fall in love with it and read it only because it's popular. They claim it's the best book ever and they can't wait for the next one and it's so, so awesome, and I can tell that they have bought into all the hype surrounding Harry Potter. People should actually think about what they read, not just read it because it's a fad or because they get an excitement high from it. Harry Potter is taking the spotlight and drawing attention away from the true classics. Of course, this isn't the author's fault, but it is true. Harry Potter is decent, but not brilliant. The problem isn't with the books- it's with our culture."
3,Teach Your Children to Think For Themselves!,"One of the most important things you can teach your children is independent, analytical thinking! So, of course, as soon as libraries and school districts start talking about banning a book, it's the first one you should buy!And what a great investment this book is. Harry Potter and his adventures will keep your kids enthralled, reading, thinking, and using their imaginations.""We want our kids to read! Oh, but not this one. . .""My home is filled with books on every subject (no one knows this like Amazon.com!) and my son is encouraged to read anything he can get his hands on. When he's choosing Harry Potter over Nintendo, how can you argue with THAT!"
5,Birth of a legend,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's stone in and of itself is a good middle school read. The book, much to its benefit, opens the reader to a much larger world and series. The series is what makes Harry Potter good, not the writing or interesting characters. This book was well-written in terms of public appeal, and should not be considered to be a highly literary work. If you read one Harry Potter book, the connections from book to book are what make the series awe-inspiring. Brava."
5,It's a great book for moms to read to their youngsters.,"Harry is a Wizard who doesn't even know it. The giant Hagrid gave Harry to his mean aunt,uncle, and three year old Dudley. The adventure begins when Profesor McGongle sends so many letters that Harry has to leave his house."
5,The best book for any age,"This book was awesome. And I don't care if people say it's for ten year olds. I'm fourteen and it was very entertaining. It stretched my imagination to the maximum. I also can't find any connection between Harry Potter and drugs. I don't see how the media could connect the two. Also The book isn't saying humans are stupid. They are just another race. The wizards are portrayed as humans might, and ""muggles"" are just a non concerning race or species. I recommend this book to anyone even if they are older than ten. As I said I'm fourteen and this book didn't seem immature or too basic at all."
4,A grownup's nostalgic treasure,"As a 29-year-old graduate student in English literature, I approached this book cautiously, disdainful of anything stamped with the word ""Bestseller."" But this book is a sheer delight. It reminds me of the Xanth novels by Piers Anthony which I used to enjoy in my youth. I love all the unique devices the author invents (I wouldn't mind having a Nimbus Two Thousand of my own!) and the message that kids have ""powers"" cultivating which adults would do well to help along.I took away a star because as I've discovered, not all adults will like this type of fiction, though certainly all children will! If you've never enjoyed the fantasy genre, this isn't the book for you. For the rest of us, try to read slowly: there are only four books and they have to last until the fifth comes out!"
5,"Wow, wow, wow: I'm 24, and I LOVE it!!!","I don't know what all the fuss is about whether or not Ms. Rowling has written books that are of ""literary"" quality, etc. I borrowed this book from my mother, a 2nd grade teacher, after hearing for so long now the split praise of it. And while I can see where some critics might find fault with certain editorial aspects of the book, I can't imagine why they'd allow such nit-picking to overshadow the truly wonderful overall composition. This is a classic story with a contemporary attitude! Children, adults -- it's got something for everyone, even a 24 year old college student wanting something to read on breaks from studying for finals. The characters are engaging, if not completely developed -- but, hey, that's because there are more books to come, more opportunities to develop everything! I'm buying copies for all my nieces, nephews, and little cousins who don't already own their own!"
5,This is not just for kids!,I just wanted to say that I am 25 years old and that it has been a long time since I've enjoyed books as much as the HP books. I read all four this week and it was so addicting that I did nothing else! I had heard about the hype but wasn't too impressed. Out of boredom I decided to read the 1st book and I thought it was just great. I'm just sad that I'll have to wait so long to read the next one. This week I got to read one after another!
5,great great great,"I just wanted to say that this was a wonderful book. And it is not just for kids. My 25 year old sister bought and read all three, she then lent them to me, her 22 year old sister, I then lent them to my 50 year old mother, who has now passed them down to my 23 year old boyfriend! The whole series is great, great, great!!!"
5,What is there not to like?,"Magic. fantasy, excitement. suspense. Makes me feel like a kid again! a 52-year old Mom!"
5,I was skeptical at first,"I was not so sure of what to think about the book. But then I saw J.K. on the Rosie O'Donnel show, so I was convinced to read the book. It is about a boy named Harry Potter who is sent to live with his muggle aunt, uncle, and cousin. He is sent to live with them when his parents are killed in a car accident. Little does he know, he's a wizard! He later finds out what really killed his parents. Then he has to later battle the ____ that killed his parents. This book has so many good points in it. I was so surprised that it was that good. This book is the GREATEST book that I've read in a long time. I'm about to start the third book and I'm looking forward to it. Please buy this book and read it soon, and when you're done with this book, read the rest of them."
2,This book was a disappointment.,"After hearing all of the rave reviews, I was expecting a book on a par with the Chronicles of Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time, the E. Nesitt books, etc. It was a nice enough story but I found it disjointed and full of distracting cliches."
2,"Not revolutionary, not award-winning, but cute...","I wonder if the big fanfare about the Harry Potter books is due to us Americans having little experience with the light/humorous fantasy books more prevalent in the UK, both adult and juvenile. I can't help but feel Rowling was influenced greatly by other authors, possibly even the hilariously clever Terry Pratchett. I like the books, but they are not, as some have decided, revolutionary in juvenile literature. I would hope this might encourage readers to expand their vision to those like C.S. Lewis, Douglas Adams, and other British writers of fantasy. Additionally, it's a downer that Harry is repeatedly placed in bad situations where the numerous authority figures to which he's entrusted at school either don't care, can't be trusted, are unbelievably unfair. Adults love these book, yes, but are actual kids comfortable with them?"
4,"Like Candy, but more expensive and less unhealthy","If you are the type who enjoys reading fluff for fun, you should almost certainly get _Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone_. Even if you are not generally a fluff reader, be aware that this is particularly good fluff. The characters are quite flat, the hero unlikely and his choices frustrating, but the book itself is quite enjoyable. The imagery is excellent and the plot, while simple, interesting. There is just enough of a twist at the end to catch the reader off guard. Rowling does not spend much time on the specifics of spell casting or explain much of the structure in her magical world, but for some people this would be unwanted background material. This also gives a more lighthearted tone, so if you like the comprehensiveness and gravity of the _Dragonlance_ saga, you might be a bit dissappointed."
4,A well written yarn,"I was pleasantly suprised by this book. Its an original compelling story that draws one in and holds on for a relatively quick read. It was not an ""I can't put this down"" read, but worth the price of the paperback.Ding from a 5 star rating; its too light a read. The plot and characterizations are not very deep or compelling. It reminds me a lot of early Heinlien (pre-60s, before he wrote his true classics). A book for the adolescent in all of us."
5,From a 6 year old girl - Ana Sofia,When I saw the first Harry Potter book lying around I got a little scared. But then my Mom who writes art books took it out one night and then I thought I have got to read it. All my friends are reading it. And now that my Mom read me the first book of Harry Potter I fell in love with it. I am almost at the 4th book but I got a little confused because I did not know where I was in the 3rd Harry Potter book.
5,I am over 35 and I loved this book!,"I NEVER read books like this and when I got it for Christmas, I thought, ""Oh, like I'm really going to read this! It's a kid's book!"" I couldn't put it down. The adventures of Harry and his pals facing a 3-head beast and an ugly, club-carrying troll kept me glued to the book for hours. I loved the very believable characters like Hermoine Granger and school bully, Draco Malfoy. We all knew people like that in school! The book is full of great characters, fast-moving adventures and lots of humor that all adults would enjoy.I am definitely a Harry Potter fan now. Sorry, ""Danielle"" and ""Syndey,"" but your novels will have to wait!"
4,Great Book,This book is great. It goes into detail about everything and creates lots of suspense. I wish it could be a bit longer though.
5,Awesome,I ordered the book for my 9 year old son and myself. We have never read nor watched the Harry Potter series. We are loving book one and so glad I waited to share this reading experience with him. We can't wait to finish book one and then we are onto the next!
4,good book,this is a really good book but the first few chapters are really really really really really really really really really (i could go on like this forever)really boring. I attempted to read it three times before I FINALLY DECIDED TO PUSH THROUGH THOSE FEW BORING CHAPTERS AND FOUND TAT I REALLY LIKED THE BOOK IN FACT I READ THE SECOND BOOK IN 1 OR TWO DAYS!
5,This author DOES dance in Dahl's footsteps.,"For a long time, I stopped reading. I just couldn't find that right author since Roald Dahl died. Sure , I read some gre at books, but I just couldn't get into them, like I would Dahl's, Llyod Alexander, Brian Jacques and so forth. When I first saw the cover of this book, I thought, ""It's probably some lousy first grade book."" Boy was I wrong. I became interested when I read in the paper that this author danced in the footsteps of Dahl. So, longing for a Dahl-like book, I read it and i am dying to read this author's next tale."
4,A book even adults can enjoy,It took me awhile to finish this but that had nothing to do with the book just other things got in the way.Well I am probably one of the few who has never read this and no one needs another review telling you what this book is about so I will skip all that and just shortly tell how I felt about the book.It was a good light read as would be expected for really a children's book. I however really enjoyed the story and found myself picking up my phone to read a few minutes when my Kindle was not near. The writing was not so simple that you get bored with it and the story kept my interest from start to finish. Looking forward to the next one.
3,This is not for adults,"I read this book out of curiosity, and while I sort of enjoyed it, it definitely is not a book for adults (I am 32). The plot is subdivided in several chapters, which are more or less self-contained (this book reminded me of a season of half hour sitcom shows). The storyline does not advance much in each chapter, but little by little something happens. Am I going to read the sequels? Maybe. Read it only if you have kids or if you're into stuff kids like."
5,Excellent,This is the third time I have read this book and still love it! J.K. Rowling 's imagination is mind boggling!
4,Harry potter and the sorcerer's stone,"One thing I liked was the blade sharp detail, but nevertheless, Harry did almost nothing with his wand. (Except stick it up a trolls nose) looking forward to getting my hands on the next book, GREAT PLOT AND SUSPENSE."
4,If you like Mr Potter...,... you might also want to read the _White Mountains_ trilogy by John Christopher: another series of books about a young man trying to find his place in an unfriendly world.
2,Fat kids getting picked on because of this book,"I am a girl in high school, and my little brother told me a story about what happened in his sixth grade, where everyone is totally hooked on this series. There are a few fat kids in his class, and he says that everyone mocks them and calls them ""Dudleys"" because the fat character in Harry Potter, who is really mean, is named Dudley. I think the author should have showed more sensitivity. Does anyone else agree? What if the mean kid was black or Jewish or Mexican? Everyone would have gotten really mad."
4,My Harry Potter review,I thought the fist harry potter book was great! The story was one of the most creative I've ever heard. I know this for two reasons....ONE:The writer was able to keep the story on track. TWO: It was the first story that i had ever read(and finished).
5,a fabulous book...couldnt put it down,"This is J.K Rowling's first book in the series and my favorite so far. She's an amazing writer with such depth and a remarkable ability to see the world in the eyes of the children who will read and love this book just as I have. You don't even realize it but as you are reading this book there is this certain love you begin to have for each of the main characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione) and a certain loathing for the bad guys (Professor Snape, Draco Malfoy). Children and adults alike will find a special place in their hearts for this series. I know I did."
5,a sevbenth grader speaks,"In my opinion and the opinion of must of the other people in my seventh grade class the book ""Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone"" was a very good book. I was on the edge of my seat when I was reading it and during the climax I could have sworn my hair stood on end! Besides the suspense I also enjoyed how interesting it was with the made-up words and interesting twists. Over all, I love the book and would recommend it to anyone that wants to be intrigued to read a great book."
4,"Wonderful, but not quite.....","...on the level of the Chronicles of Narnia[C.S. Lewis], the Dark is Rising series[Susan Cooper], or the Tales of Prydain[Lloyd Alexander]. However, the is highly entertaining, eminently readible fare. For me, though it falls just a little short of these classics, although the Potter series will become a classic down the road."
4,"4 stars for the AUDIO version, 5 stars for the book!","I have to take away at least one star for Jim Dale's reading of this story. His inflections were strange and poorly timed. On more than one occasion there was a passage that he read flat or pensive that ended in ""she exclaimed""! Oh well, as long as you can make the mental adjustments for how the text OUGHT to read, you'll do fine. I spend 2-3 hours in my car daily, so this was a great way to be a part of the Potter craze."
5,This is my new favorite book.,I got this book on my 14th birthday and stayed up until 12:30 AM to finish it. I can't wait until I get the Chamber of Secrets. This book deserves the Five Star rating it has. I certainly hope that Rowling writes the last six as good as the first one.
5,Never get tired of reading it,"This is the third time I've read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I really enjoyed reading this along with Pottermore. Pottermore incorporates a lot of the details mentioned in the story. It was fun to pay attention to the little details this time since I know the story so well. I also liked reading the bonus material she wrote on Pottermore - it adds a lot to the story. I don't know if I realized this before, but J.K. Rowling is excellent at showing and not telling. For example: ""[Mr. Dursley] hummed ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" and as he worked, jumped at small noises."" She doesn't have to say that he's starting to lose it because I've decided that for myself. The books have so many fun characters that aren't in the movies. I love how optimistic and humble Harry is. I also like how light-hearted and quirky the books are. The movies tend to focus on the darker aspects of the story. I never get tired of reading these books."
5,Great read.,"Wonderful! Hard to put it down. I truly enjoyed every word, and look forward to moving forward in the series."
5,Great book!,great book! filled in many if the blanks from the movie. i would highly recommend this book to harry potter fans.
5,Remember The Magic In Our Lives,"First I have to say being a bit older and everything I thought that the whole Harry Potter series phenomon was ""just a phase"" but intrigued by a friend who is a teacher and mother of 2 I decided to read this fist and let me tell you I was instantly hooked! I am proud to say I am 23 years old and a fan of Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling reminds us what it's like to be a kid again! Her hero and weaving of the perfect imagiative and cerative story is timeless! I bet when my children go to school Harry Potter will be on the ""required reading list"" cause it is something you really need to experience to believe! Remember the magic in our lives, throw out your inabitions and escape out of the muggle world and into a truly magical adventure!"
3,"A good start, and the best since Roald Dahl exited the scene","I never actively set out to read the Harry Potter books - always felt that they sounded like Roald Dahl's children's books (which I really enjoyed!). That changed when someone gave me the first 3 books. So, I figured I had nothing to loose. As things go, my first impression that Harry Potter was written in the same vein as Roald Dahl was true. That is good because that makes the book quite enjoyable to read! However, I did feel at times that J.K. Dowling took the 'simple' route out and didn't really show any signs of wonderful little eccentric plot twists until the end of the book. Maybe this is because I am an adult. I am sure for kids and young teenager and the young at heart, this book is magic in itself. I will let slip that having progressed beyond this book in the series, it is defintely worth hanging in there - and you have to read this book to get going... You will enjoy it!"
4,A Really Good Book,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, written by J.K. Rowling, is one of the best books I have ever read. Harry Potter, an eleven year old who lives with his horrid aunt, uncle and cousin is invited to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when he finds out that he is a wizard. At Hogwarts he meets such friends as Ron Weasley, a tall red-haired boy, Hermione Granger, the smartest witch in her class, Rubeus Hagrid, a big, friendly giant and albus Dumbledore, the principal of the school. But will Harry have enough brains to figure out what's going on at Hogwarts? Find out in this awesome book that is for the whole family."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (book 1),"I bought the book because I wanted to understand what all the fuss was. I have to tell you, this book is fantastic. I could not put it down. It is full of adventure, heart, and fun. Rowling, does an exceptional job of bringing the characters and and their surroundings to life. From the beginning when Harry is at Privet drive to Hogwarts, to coming face-to-face with ""you know who"", the reader is embraced by the lead character and all that he experiences. I am hooked. I am on the 3rd book of the series and am looking forward to the 4th book. In each tale, you become more attached to Harry and his friends, you can really appreciate their innocenence, their bravery and their sense of adventure. It does not matter what age you are, these are just really fantastic books. I cant wait to see the movie!"
5,The amazing,"Harry Potter 1 is one of the best books I have read in my life. It is very exiting. The characters are great. I like how every one of them are different, but in a way they are similar."
4,Fun fantasy,"Very enjoyable, likeable characters, compelling plot. I like fantasy so this was right up my alley. Four stars instead of five because I didn't get emotionally attached as with other books I have read, but I will definitely continue the series."
5,A piece of art!,I just finished reading this book and I have to say I am hooked! I LOVE it! Beautifully written and has a great plot and moral! It is really piece of art. Their were so many times when I just understood what the characters were going through. The plot of the story kept me at the edge of my seat waiting for what was going to happen and it wasn't something that was easily predictable.Would recommend for ages 9 (possibly 8) through adulthood.
5,Great book,We bought this as a gift for a friend's daughter and she loves it. She is becoming obsessed with Harry Potter!
4,Nice Fantasy Book,I enjoyed reading this book but don't see what all the hype is about and why it has been so popular. It is very easy and fun to read. I am 15 year old avid fantasy reader. Thank you for reading my review.
4,A great book for everyone,"You should read Harry Potter if you like drama and excitement in your stories. This book has it all. Harry Potter is for all ages. Things I like in it, and it probably has things you'd like to. Harry Potter is a boy that's soon to find out about his parents and himself. He lives with his Aunt and Uncle they try to stop him finding out that, he is a Wizard."
5,AWESOME!,"I was recently recommnded by my friends to read this book so i did. And i was surprised to find ir totally awesome! It has the best plot and the characters are so cool too. hehe, but i think that they Harry and Ron should be a BIT nicer to Hermoine..."
4,Great Book,I am 9 years and i really enjoyed this book and most of my friends did too. It's never boring and I can't wait to read the next three.
4,Great,It's a very good read more for the younger to late teen....but if u like mystery and excitement through out you will enjoy this.
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone,"I read the fist book of the series and was completely blown away.A story of a boy wizard who grew up not knowing what he really was. Who on his eleventh birthday was introduced into a new world, which he belonged in all his life. Who attended a magical school of wizardry and witchcraft. Once there he quickly made best friends who will clearly play major roles in the future books. No story would be complete without villains which this book provides a great deal of. While at the school Harry uncovers his dark past and how he ended up living with his relatives. At the end of the school year Harry comes face to face with an evil figure from his past. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is clearly on its way to becoming one of the century's best books."
4,A great start to an even better series,"This is the first in a series of seven books. It's a great start and a wonderful way to introduce the characters, the setting, and the conflict. The next books in the series are better in that they start to more fully develop the characters, intensify the danger, and darken the conflict. I have read this book many, many times, including reading it in other languages, and I am well into my 30's. It's a nice way to lose yourself for a few hours into a fantasy world that you can just almost believe is real."
5,The best book I have ever read,Harry Potter is the cutest little boy I have ever met in a book. I am still waiting my acceptence to Hogwarts!!!. You have to read this book and then read the second one !!!
5,I wish I went to Hogwarts!!!!,"I'm not supposed to be in the age range that this book appeals to but you shouldn't pay attention to that. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is smart, imaginative and keeps you guessing right to the end. A great adventure to take your children on."
5,Awesome entry into the magical world of Harry Potter!!,"In 1997, as a student in Canada I had heard all the hype surrounding a book called _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_. Hence, that Christmas as I was waiting at Pearson's Airport I saw the book and bought it. For the next 3 hours I was captivated by the world which Rowling's had created. I didn't want the story to end. I was hooked! For me that was my iniciation into the wonderful world of Harry Potter!! My feelings of love and not wanting the story to end remain as true today as they were that wintry day in Toronto.~FallenMoon"
4,Harry Potter,This book is very good for children who like adventure and magic and sometimes scarey. The book is about a boy named Harry whose parents are killed and now Harry has to live with his anut and uncle and their spoiled son Dudly. One day Harry founds out by a letter that he is execpted at Hogwarts the school of witch craft and wizardy. There he meets some new friends Ron and Hermione and some founds dangers that lay ahead for Harry. He also finds out more about his parents and his own life as well.
2,too long and boring,"I found the Harry Potter series to be ok, but for me it went on too long, and the series could have been pared down a little. The first book was fairly entertaining, with all the magical scenes taking place at Hogwarts, and there was some nice humor and interesting characters, but it all became a little bland after awhile. For a much better read, I recommend Roderick Blackwood and the Demon Stone by Ralph Rathbone. It's very entertaining and basically has all the boring bits taken out, so it's an exciting read from start to finish. You get the sense sometimes that Rowling knew she had to fill up numerous books, so things drag on a bit. In Roderick Blackwood and the Demon Stone, things don't drag at all, and it's non-stop magical action which keeps you wanting to turn the page and find out what happens next."
3,Not the full size hardcover.,"Unfortunately, I ordered this book thinking I was getting the full size hardcover book. It's the smaller version hardcover. It's fine. I should have read the description more clearly to make sure I was getting what I thought."
2,Not what I thought,Front cover was extremely creased and wrinkled. I expected it to be in better condition for the rating it was given.
2,"Lots of surprises, but a slow beginning.","This book was entertaining because many of the plot events took me by surprise. However, the beginning really dragged and it took a long time for me to get into it."
5,A mere kid's book? I think not!!!,"I bought this book for my 10 year old daughter, who devoured it. She loved it so much, she insisted on starting to read it aloud to me one night as I was washing dishes. I, of course, ended up staying up that night to read the book all the way through to its conclusion! Charming, exciting, engaging simply wonderful -- beginning to end. I'm almost 40 and have not enjoyed a book so much in a long time. J.K. Rowling -- my hat is off to you!!!"
5,5 Stars? Try 10!,While growing up my favorite author was Roald Dahl. So delighted I was to find out that a new author has written wondeful books that follow in Dahl's footsteps. The books is absolutely delightful and will satisfie and reader's craving.
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was the best book I have read;it never got boring. The book is about a eleven year old kid whose parents died. His mom's sister recieved him on their doorstep. When he grew up his new parents told him that his parents died of a car crash. His new family also had a kid who was a spoiled bratand beat up poor Harry. One day on his eleventh birthday he was visited by a wizard named Hagrid who told him he was a wizard and found out that his parents lied to him.He later on in the book went to a famous wizard and witch school. In the school he finds a secret room and learns about the Sorcerer's Stone. The book is an exciting and is a very good book to read I give this book 5 stars.
2,so-so,"I have honestly seen better books. I love fantasy, but the old classics really reign supreme over today's stuff. Except for Brian Jacques' work.He is an awesome writer!T. A. Barron is also very good. OK, shoot me. I mean, a kid who lives under the stairs,goes to a magic school at age 11 and has some adventures. Whatever."
4,a good book,"I found this story fantastic, and I must say that it gets better in each book. This is the kind of book that start reading and you can't stop anymore! The whole story af Harry Potter has five books. When you read the first one you may find that the story is for kids but in the second book you can see more action"
5,Such an easy read,"I picked up the first Harry Potter book, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE on a flight...figured I would finally see what all the fuss was about....After a short one hour flight, I found myself nearing page 100! I have never had such an easy read. It's fun, intriguing, exceptionally easy to get into (one of my worries when first purchasing the book), and as I stated earlier--as supremely easy read.Pick it up!"
5,How to get along with people,I think this was a good book beacuse It tells new people to not be afrade of the stuff in there new place. Like if you were new you shouldnt wory about people thinking you are dome or stupid. so what I trying to say is dont worry how you look.
5,A fantastic book for everyone!,"I was reading the paper when I read a review of Harry Potter and how popular it is now among children and adults. Naturally I got very intrigued and bought it right away. Once I began reading this book i couldn't stop. It's amazing!!! It is a ""kids"" kind of subject matter BUT that doesn't mean that adults shouldn't read it. It is very interesting and the story line pulls you into the adventure. A great book for people how enjoy reading. This is no ""Pride and Prejudice"" but it is certainly a fun read and should be read. And OF COURSE it is an amazing book for kids!"
5,THE FIRST BOOK IN AN AWESOME SERIES!,"Harry Potter is a pretty normal boy... or so they thought. Harry has experienced weird things. When he gets mad or upset he can break things with his mind. When he is chased by his awfull cousin he can summon powers to help him escape. Then one day, a not-so-normal person will come and change his life forever. He will take him away from his beastly aunt and uncle and cousin. He has a lot to learn... the thing is ... will he survive. His past will give you chills... his future will leave you speechless.Whatever happens, he will never be the same..."
5,Wonderful Series,My niece and nephew went crazy over these books. Anxiously awaiting the next book. Great way to get young people to read. Great imagination that catches everyone who reads them and transports them to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and sorcery.
4,i finally read it,"After all this time I've finally started to read the Harry Potter series. I had planned on avoiding it still, but I figure anyone who makes a study of popular culture, the Potter series is a must. It surprised me by turning out to be quite good. I wouldn't have expected it to create the mania it did, but still I found it to be a well-written and entertaining book. Not at all offensive. And a little simplistic at times."
5,Not just for kids!,"One of the most creative and entertaining books, I've read in years. It's Roald Dahl on acid!"
4,Review: Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone,"This book was pretty good. It had many exciting moments. The book lead you to think that one person was bad when it was really another. It start with Harry Potter, who lives with his aunt and uncle. They tell him that his parrents died in a car crash, which isn't true. Eventually a man named Hagrid comes and takes Harry to get ready to go to a school for wizards. This is where Harry's real adventures begin. He makes new friends and enemies. After a while of being at the school he learns that someone is trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. He and his two friends go and try to stop the person. Harry travels to the place where the stone is kept and retrieves it so that the evil Voldemort can't get it. This story is exciting and is over all a good book."
5,Harry Potter is an instant hero.,"I read this book because it was recommended by Rosie O'Donnell when she interviewed J.K. Rowling. For the first time in my life, I wished I were a preteen again. It's a wonderfully rich story filled with interesting characters. The world Rowling creates is astounding."
3,Overrated and bland,"This book is overrated, bland, and very commercial. I really don't see what the fuss is about. I've read worse (hence the three stars), and the plot does move, but it lacks the magic of real children's classics. Read C.S.Lewis, Dahl, Tolkien, Baum."
4,I don't care,"I'm fourteen, and I don't care what people say about this book. I don't care if it's too simple, or too predictable, or if the characters don't develop in the story, or whatever. The important thing is that it's an exciting, entertaining, fun-to-read-book that makes the reader feel like a part of the story. A friend from Luxemburg introduced me to Harry Potter, and I was hooked. For weeks after I've read it, I was in a dreamworld, thinking about what it would be like to receive that letter, to go to Hogwarts and to meet all the characters. I have to say that I don't actually believe in a school for witches and wizards, but all the same it was a wonderful and well-written book. I'm not missing the third one!!!!"
4,My Harry Potter review(Anthony C.),I thought the fist harry potter book was great! The story was one of the most creative I've ever heard. I know this for two reasons....ONE:The writer was able to keep the story on track. TWO: It was the first story that i had ever read(and finished).
4,Cleverly written book,"J.K. Rowlings has written a clever mix of all my favourite school girl stories ( The St.Clare's/Mallory Towers series of Enid Blyton), hints of Tolkien, C.S.Lewis, and even Roald Dahl. It's a pity that not many kids seem to read these authors in these days, but better that they fall for Harry Potter than not live in a book-induced haze of sorts at all.( What a wonderful feeling, at any age!) She has effectively replaced some of the more dated concepts with a veneer of modern references and even political correctness ( boy with dreadlocks, Parvati Patil(! ) etc., etc.) But the basic appeal of the story remains the same as many great stories -- The triumph of the under-dog."
5,Harry Potter book,"I received the book on time and it was in the condition that was described. I have not read the book yet, but I am sure that I will like it since I like the movie."
4,Fun First Year at Hogwarts,"I am an adult who had seen all of the Harry Potter movies (at the urging of Potterhead friends) but had never read any of the books, mostly because they were ""for kids."" After seeing the final film, I wanted to know a little bit more about the story, so at my sister's urging, I finally picked up the first book. And now I'm wondering--what took me so long?I won't summarize the plot (that's been done many, many times before) but I will say that I found this novel to be fun, light, and interesting exposition for the rest of the series. Since I know what the ultimate conclusion will be, it was fun for me to see how the whole story fits together, and to see the pieces from the beginning that will add to the whole! Even though I was familiar with the story, I found the book to be charming, fast paced, and engaging, even for an adult reader. When I finished I immediately wanted to start book 2!"
3,Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition),"Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition).I wanted to purchase a replacement volume for my daughters original Harry Potter collection so I was little disappointed since this volume does not match the appearance of the original publisher's books. The story, of course, is great!"
5,Very well written and very entertaining,"Too be honest, I was very skeptical about this book. Magic creatues spells potion and that type of thing wasn't my style. But since it was highly recommended from many sources I gave it a shot. And suprise......... This became one of the best books I had ever read. This book is entertaining for people(muggles) of all ages. The amazon age level reads 8-12 but I would say 8-99 is more like it. I recommend this book to everyone."
5,A great read for people of all ages!,"When I first heard about this book, I wasn't sure if it was a book just for kids or young teens, or if adults would get into it as well... Rest assured, as soon as I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. The thing that fascinated me most about the book was how it was able to transport me back in time and space to when I was a young kid, just learning the joy of reading. It was almost as if I was being introduced to the incredible power of the fantasy genre all over again! While told in terms that people of all ages will understand, it really is a timeless tale, one that anyone can pick and completely escape inside for as long as it takes to read. Truly a remarkable book, no matter how old (or young at heart) you are!"
5,Excellent book - so is the sequel,My name is Rafe Markham and I am 8 years old. I think Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone (Sorcerers Stone in America) is just about the best book I have ever read. I would say it was the best but I have read another one (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) which is just as good. I think J.K. Rowling is an excellent author. She puts in lots of descriptions and I imagine I am there doing what Harry Potter does. They are truly thrilling books. I can't wait for the third one to come out.
5,"SIMPLY, THE GREATEST!!!!!!!",When I read this I almost fainted at how J.k. Rowling makes every little detail a huge outcome at the end.It denfinently is a must read!
2,poor quality,"This is a great book, however if you are looking for a complete set of the HP books in hardcover this is not the version to buy. This version has a very poorly made hard cover with no sleve and is much smaller then the hardcover version of the later books."
5,An Excellent Introduction to an Unforgettable Story,"I have now read the entire series of Harry Potter books three times, and am in the process of reading them aloud to my six year old daughter. She and my four year old laugh out loud and really enjoy them, but they are also witty and well-written enough for me (obviously). These books are doing a lot to increase her vocabulary and develop a love for books, besides being funny and engaging stories. When my son was a newborn, this is what I read while pacing the floors with him at 6 am."
5,It was a great Mystery,"Harry Potter was a well written book. It was my kind of book and it had a lot of action in it. It was so intresting that it was hard for me to put it down. I also like Mysteries so thats why I liked this book.Dear author, What ever you do don't kill Harry or Ron Sincerly your Reader,"
5,Harry Potter is a great book for kids 7-14!,"Hey all you mothers and teachers out there. If you are gettingsick and tired of seeing your kids wasting their time in front of the telivision, Nintendo 64, or the computer, then you will LOVE this book. The characters are original and amusing, the plot uplifting and intresting, and the book in general is GREAT! In fact my 17 year old daughter actually read it and admited that even she liked it! And please do not believe those shameful rumors that the book is Satanic and that children who read it will start worshiping the devil. That's rubish! By reading this book kids will learn that it is not wrong to be different, that being special is cool. I hope this review has helped ...Adios!"
2,Very Slow and Somewhat Boring,"When I read ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"",I was very disapointed in the content and general story. After hearingso many great comments about the book, I finally decided to read it myself. After I did so, I was surprised with what I had read. I am very disapointed that I can not like Harry Potter as so many others do."
5,Loosen up!,"This is an awesome book! It's fun, adventurous, and funny! People who don't like it because they think it is bad have their right to think so, I mean, no one in the world has the exact same opinion, right? But the stuff about it being anti christ and awefull for your kids is utterly rediculous! If your kids know it's not real, why be so scared it's going to make them stop going to church and worship the devil? The way most kids are influenced by Harry Potter is they want to read more! In other words, it's a good thing! Don't forget, there are OTHER religions in the world, other religions that fing it perfectly acceptable. And besides, if magic is so bad, why are there so many books about it that do-good-soccor-moms havn't freaked about?"
5,This book was the greatest book I ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"And no this wasn't the first book I ever read either. Most of my friends have read it and all of them loved it also. If you were looking for a good book to read, this would be it! You probably wouldn't like it though, if you didn't read books much. I'd give this book an A+++++++++++++++++ ect."
5,Even better than The Narnia Chronicles,"Harry Potter is undoubtedly one of the best books I've ever read. Period. It combines comedy, suspense, mystery, drama, and all of the other genres into one. Trust me: YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THIS BOOK!"
5,"Very good book, and I'm not even finished!","I first heard about these books a few weeks ago on the news, then proceeded to check out Amazon.com...with almost 2000 reviews, this has got to be a good book, so I bought it...it's not good, it's VERY good! It's very consistent and never takes a boring downward spiral...and I'm not even finished! Then come the reviews, which is the deciding point between customers buying it or not. I heard the good reviews and the bad...the bad reviews are probably made by prudish people who want nothing but peace...I can't agree more for peace, but it's never gonna be exactly like you want it. I'm pretty sure kids won't take it that far and try witchcraft, because most likely, it won't work. But that's beside the point. Anyone who wants to read an interesting book should pick this up...I'm sure the other 2 in the series are good, too."
5,You can't wait to see what happens next!,This book is so cool!Things in this book are so strange and mysterious.You always want to find out what is going to happen next.I love all the weird names and people.When you're reading this book it describes everything so well that you feel like you're at Hogwarts school with Harry.It is a great book!
4,Use the Magic Carefully,"Do you believe in magic? At Hogwarts you do. This is a fantastic, fictional book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. J.K. Rowling is the author. She has three main characters: Harry, Ron, and Hermione. All of these children go to a magical school, where they learn how to be a witch or wizard. J.K. Rowling made this book from a dream she had.This book makes me feel curious if there really is school like Hogwarts. I like this feeling because it always keeps me thinking. I also wonder why J.K. Rowling decided to make her dream into a book. Sometimes I wish I could have a dream like J.K. Rowling did. I just love feeling this way!"
3,Great primer,This is a great intro to the Harry Potter world for those who are looking to see what all the fuss is about. It describes the characters and suggests their motives and inner conflicts so that you will be able to go on to other books with a good understanding in place.
3,andrew's book review,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone By J.K. Rowling is about a boy who turns 11 and finds out he's a wizard. He also finds out that he is going to a school called Hogwarts School for Witch Craft and Wizardry. There he meets two friends and learns magic. At the end of the year he relies just how much danger he's in BY this evil wizard named Voldemort.I think Harry Potter was a good book. One reason is that it was about wizardry. Another reason is that it was an easy read but got harder as it went along. Thirdly because it was 7 series long so it just kept getting better. Harry Potter is a really good book.
5,HP Sorcerer's Stone - the magical beginning to one of the best fantasy series of all time,"I have to admit upfront I don't feel qualified to review this book. It's simply brilliant, and it gets even more so each time I read it. For those who don't know, it's the tale of an orphaned boy whose uneventful life turns upside down when he learns he's a wizard. At Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, he joins loyal Ron and brainy Hermione in balancing schoolwork, rivalries and illegal dragons...all while trying to prevent the return of the most evil wizard known to man.The novel has its share of familiar fantasy elements - an orphaned boy, a wise and kindly old wizard, and a collection of dragons, unicorns, centaurs, ghosts and spells. But creativity abounds, from the wizarding game of Quidditch to the mirror of erised. Add to that Rowling's sense of humor, magical descriptions, penchant for details, and web of foreshadowing, and you have the ingredients for a classic."
4,Simply Magical,"Funny and delightful. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I want to be friends with Harry Potter, even though I'm only a Muggle. :)"
4,Grown-ups will love this too!,"As a teacher (and an adult), I am delighted to discover Harry Potter. After a slow start (during which I questioned all the hype...), the book proved to be hugely entertaining, very creative and full of surprises. I am already into the second book and have the third on order. I'm certain adults who are knowledgeable about Harry Potter will gain all kinds of admiration from his younger fans. Hurray for fantasy that adults can enjoy too!"
5,A Great Book,Though the beginning is rather hard to getn into as the as the story umnfolds it becomes a unique and wonderful book. The Author is a genius. I am reading this for a mother\daughter book club and I absolutely love the end. I thing the activies will be quite interesting (we are playing quiditch) and the discussion great.
5,HARRY POTTER RULES,This book is very cool because its just not for kids.If you like books like the Hoobit and other things!hey you get this book and you will love it i garntee!!
5,Who's the villain?,I like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone because of the way he didn't know about his past until it just jumped out at him unexpectedly. The best thing about this book is that you are never really certain who the bad guys are. It may be someone you would least expect.
5,Brings magic back into the heart!,"Imaginative, fun and exciting. What a great story for all ages. Perfect to share with the entire family."
5,"Different, but by far the best book I have ever read!",This book was not like your average Sweet Valley Twins realistic fiction. It was different. It was creative and funny. It actually made me want to go to the school where this book takes place. This was the author's first novel. I hope she writes more stories about the same characters. It was an excellent book. I loved it.
5,IT'S THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When I read the first chapter my teacher said to stop reading but it was so exciting I had to keep reading. And I think it's extraordinary how the story became a book. My favorite charector is Prof. Dumbledoor because I like his personality. I just started the 2nd Harry potter and I bet it's going to be just as good as the 1st.
2,It was Boring to Me,I found Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to be boring. It was just to slow to get to a point. I do recommend The Lord of the Rings!!! Check this out at the Library before you get it.
4,Harry Potter,"In this first book Harry Potter has been tortured by the Durleys. Harry over came that when he found out that he was a wizard. But then he also got a bad new, he found out that his parents didn't die in a car accident, they were killed by a dark wizard that named himself Lord Voldemort. He tied to kill Harry when he was a baby but couldn't, so he tried it again when he was ten years old. Harry survied one more time and it was because of his mother's love. In this first book you might not find lots of action but as you read it it will take you into a different world that, like Harry, you don't know about."
4,Imanginative.,"I don't really know what all the fuss is about. I mean it is indeed and excellent book but I reckon all the kids just ran out and bought it because everyone else did. I, personally, was displeased with the book - it was too slow, unimangianable and uses up it's talent too quickly. I was displeased but all the same I loved it.Harry Potter is a ""human"" who has been taken away from the abusive Dursley family to be taken to a school called Hogwarts. Why? Because he is a wizard. But it's not that fun when you have a dark lord and a huge scar on your trail.If your looking for imaginative fun, a chilling and thrilling plot and a huge amount of violence and awesomeness - I totally recommend Harry Potter.Anyway, wasn't the title of the book actually HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE?"
5,AMAZING,The book is just amazing there's no words to describe the epicness that is Harry Potter yeah this book is a MUST read.
2,Unhappy with product!,I was unhappy with this product as the book came with a LARGE discount sticker on the cover which I was unable to removed without tearing the jacket. This was intended as a gift which I was unable to send.
5,Give your kids a chance-Katherine,"I read this book just after the 5th book came out, when I was 9. I read them all in about a week and have been a fan ever since. These books are brilliant! As for the whole devil issue, does it ever say to worship witchcraft in the book? There is a certain element of choice in this. If you don't want to read the book, thats your choice and I'm not going to make your choice for you. But before you stop your kid from reading the book, you have to remember that everyone they know is going to be reading it, and that its not like they're going to become evil anti-christian devil-witchs just by reading a book. At least sit down and give them a fair chance to convince you to let them read the book. It's just a book, remember. The kid might not even like it! I'm 12 now and I think that its just mean not to let a kid read a book because it talks about witches. I hope I helped form some new views on the subject for you."
4,Fantasy With a Kick,"Fantasy and science fiction stories have always been a good choice to read and escape reality and create a mystical world to stimulate one's imagination. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a exciting story about a young orphan boy who finds out he has mystical powers and is being chased by a renegade wizard. He also has all sorts of adventures at the school in which he was accepted to. There is never a dull moment in this story, there is always someone causing trouble or amusing magic that the children have to try to perform in thier class. For example, the kids have to turn one thing into something else for an exam. Almost around every turn there are other mythical animals around that get involved in the plot like centaurs, dragons and unicorns. This book is entertaining and easy reading, to which makes the book almost impossible to put down. For those who love fantasy and science fiction books, this would be a good book for them to read at any age."
4,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a good book.,"Harry Potter was a wizard.When he was a young boy his parents died, but I will not tell you how because you have to read the book because it is a really good book. Many people say it promotes witchcraft and wizardry. I think it is just a fun book because it is in a series of 4 books. You don't have to read just one and figure out what will happen to Harry you can find out by reading the rest of them. If you decide to take my critique to heart you will be hooked on this book and you will have to read the rest of the series. The book brings you into the story and makes you feel like you are at the Wizard school learning what Harry is learning."
5,An Intriguing Twist on the Cinderella Theme!,"This is a wonderfully entertaining yet thought-provoking book. Rowling is one of the new greats in children's literature. Harry is abused physically & emotionally, little-knowing that he has a heritage to be proud of. The far-reaching love of his parents & the steadfast (but far from perfect) friends he makes at school give the story life & depth. Nearly every name has a deeper meaning. Excellent reading for anyone 10 or older! FYI, this is NOT a primer for Neo-Pagan religion (Christmas & Easter are celebrated at Hogwart's). If this is a concern for a parent, read & discuss the book with your child. But this book by no means deserves to be banned for that reason."
5,This book was the absolute best book in the world,"This book I loved, loved so much that I wish there was more of that book. Even though there are more books I wish that were longer. I liked it because everytime I read it, it got more and more exciting. Well until it ended:). So if I put it down, 2 minutes later i picked it back up. Thanks."
5,"Harry Potter,The Sourceres Stone","This book is a great book. There are five main characters in this book Harry, and his aunts family and the anonymous letter sender. This book is about a boy named Harry Potter that moves to his aunts house after his parents die in a car accident. His cousin is a spoiled brat. then after his eleventh birthday some wierd unknown person sends Harry so many letters, but his mean uncle wont let him read them. In the end Harry manages to steal a letter from his ucle . The letter turned out to be an invitation to a much happier place than living in a closet card board box that was his so called room. This book was a great book. It was a New York's Bestseller. It could be given a oscar I think. I think everyone should read the series in 7th grade to forever."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITEN!!!!,"At first when my teacher Mrs. Rubino interdused this book to our class I wasn't too empressed. But now I love it! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is increedable!! I know that you will love charictors like Hagrid, Ron, Professer Mogonagle,Vold...I meen, You know who! and of course Harry Potter! Want to know more? Then PICK UP THIS BOOK AND READ!!! Are you hooked?"
3,"big mac of magic adventures (sells, but...)","The book is easy and fun (for the most part) to read, somewhat addictive.I also thought it was simplistic and low-quality work. Definitely not a classic.It does not come close to good ol' Lord of the Rings or A Wizard of Earthsea (a less well-known but very exciting and thoughtful magic adventure from which Harry Potter borrows some of its plot, but unfortunately not much more)."
5,An amazing adventure!,"From the first page, Rowling had me guessing. I had the needed hate for the Dursley's, Snape and Malfoy. I rooted for and loved Harry, Ron and Hermione. And the end, well my gosh, I was shocked and amazed! I can't wait to share this book with my future children"
4,A Fun Ride to Hogwarts,An easy read intro to Harry Potter and the wizarding world of Hogwarts. It gives you just enough so you look forward to the next adventure. I highly recommend it for young readers.
5,Great Beginning to a wonderful story..,"I remember my first grade teacher reading this book to my class back in the day. I'm so glad because reading it again and again is such a wonderful, magical experience. Praise to J.K Rowling!!!"
5,IT WAS GREAT!!!!! A Great easy read for summer!!!!,I thought this book was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It was about Harry's first year at the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. And also the annoying Draco Malfoy and also the evil Him-who-must-not-be-named. ( Voldemort). He ends his horrible life with his aunt and uncle Dursley and his new exciting life at Hogwarts. It was a great book and I would really reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys magic and a little humor.
5,I loved it!!,"I am eight years old and I loved this book. My favorite part would have to be when he got a Nimbus 2000 broom stick (actually that is my second favorite part, but my favorite part is at the end and I don't want to give it away). I have started the second book and my favorite part of that book would be when Ron got a howler. I recommend these books. Even though they are long, you will probably finish them in no time."
5,The most wonderful story forever,"This is the first Harry Potter and my first Harry Potter book and it really bring me to a magic world. At first I read it in China, in Chinese translation, now reading it in English helps me to better understanding its culture and its words use are just amazing! Whenever I read it I'll close my eyes and image that I'm also a friend of Harry and experience the adventure in that magic world. This is the most wonderful story book ever, period. Every child will learn about it and enjoy the fun and happiness it brings."
5,Great Buy,Great purchase from GoodWill. They shipped a very good condition copy. We love the Harry Potter series and it's a great way to encourage imaginative reading. Affordable and fun. I would recommend this series.
5,Never gets old!,This is my second time reading the Harry Potter series. Better than the movie! it never gets old! love love love!
5,Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone!,"Exciting, exciting exciting!!! A cliff hanger at the end of every chapter, suspense in every paragraph! You've tried all of the other so called ""good books"" so try the best!! ~AJ~"
5,THIS IS BOOK IS THE BEST!,"I remember when I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. This book is so good it is worth reading again and again, and as soon as the sequel came out I bought and read that to. It's like being sucked into world that has a little bit of reality, and a lot of imagination. This book is one of those that you can really be a part of the action. This is a great book and I definitely recommend it!"
5,This Book is Awesome,When I heard of the Harry Potter books I went out and bought them all. They are really cool. This book was my favorite. I really loved it alot. I loved it so much i read three times.
4,Another adult hooked on Harry Potter.,"I dismissed the HP craze as nonsense until recently. Needing refuge from a very difficult situation, I immersed myself in Sorceror's Stone one evening and enjoyed every minute of it.As if by magic (laugh), my troubles were completely resolved a few days after finishing this enchanting story. Looking forward to reading the entire series."
4,Good for all ages,"I was pushed into this book by my wife, a 4th grade teacher, who wanted me to get into the series before going to see the movie. While used to reading mostly history and adult fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the story.Although I am not head-over-heels pumped to read the next volumes, I see how kids and adults alike can lose themselves in this fantasy, far-fecthed as it may be.I disagree with those who discount Potter on religious reasons because it supposedly sensationalizes occultism. There is more than just magic in this book. Kids can learn the lessons of trust and friendship, among others, Rowling weaves into this adventure."
4,The sorcerers stone,"It's a good book, I choose 4 stars because it was a good book but it felt as if there was something missing, but it was a good book."
5,A great book,"I have read all sorts of fantasy and sci fi, but this is one of the best I have ever read. Henry Potter is a character you instantly love. His relatives are the bad guys that you love to hate, and his school is every kid's fantasy. My mother read this and suggested it to me. I read it and thought it was great. Now my little brother is reading it and he loves it. I couldn't put it down. It's great for every age range. It's just a really good story. It comes highly recomended by everyone I know who's read it. If you haven't read it you should."
5,rented,so glad I was able to rent this through my prime account. Had fun reading it on my kindle paperwhite
1,Pottermore is a SCAM,"So I decide to buy this book for my kindle because I enjoyed the series and I'm directed to the ""Pottermore"" site and they force you to accept cookies into your computer, which is essentially a virus, before you can purchase. No cookies, no purchase. Keep the book..and you're cookies."
3,Sexy Book,This book is not the best book in the world but its not a bad book! Well now see if you like!
1,Don't buy this book on cassette,"This review is not for the book, which I loved but for listening library's quality of cassettes. I have all the Harry Potter books on cassette and after listening to them several times the extremely poor quality of the cassettes came through. Every book has one or more cassettes that are ruined. I own over 50 Audio books by Brilliance and have listened to many of them 100's of times and only had on problem with the tape and it was promptly replaced. Listening library does not stand by their produce at all, instead of replacing a single cassette they replaced the whole book with very poor grace, and now 3 cassettes are ruined in that book. The representive told me they would replace the tape but that would be the last time. So now I am stuck with all 7 books on cassette which was a big mistake on my part, get the CD's instead. I will now have to invest big bucks to re-buy the books."
4,Fantasmo,"Can't wait to see what's to come in the wonderful world of Hogwarts! A quick and fun read, couldn't put it down."
1,"After month and months of hype, I sat down and read this book.","I went into it with some hesitation, but figured it was bound to be a good read.. EVERYONE I talked to said so.All I kept thinking throughout the whole thing was ""Dear lord, this harlot has ripped off 'Books of Magic'! Right down the effing owl!""I finished the book pissed off and permanently biased.How anyone can say that this woman has any talent is beyond me.. she hasn't got an original idea floating around in her head."
1,This book is horrible!,"And I don't mean the way stuff is written. I'm referring to the story! Not only does it have snake prejudice (i.e. Slytherin(pure evil)=snakes), but it just puts things as black and white (referring to good or bad). Think about it: the only exception is Professor Snape, the Potions teacher Harry has prejudice against.And it also leaves some questions. Why would perfect Albus Dumbledore let ""bad"" kids join the school when they might commit crimes there (i.e., students like Voldemort)? And why would snakes side with Voldemort in symbolism and literalism (you find this out in the later books), simply because he's evil!?!In fact, I don't see what's to like about the book (in terms of things that I like): Snake prejudice (HOW COULD anyone!?!?!), witchcraft, geeks like Ron Weasley as perfect brats!?!"
1,Cool,"Really great book. great vocabulary used in the text. good plot line. ron weasley was very funny in several ways. over all,great book!"
1,damaged book,"i bought Harry potter, and about 30 pages in the middle of the book is binding poorly. even some sentences are missing."
1,condition of Book,"The condition of this book was listed as ""Like New"". Should have been listed, ""Very Used"", I didn't even want to touch the book when I opened the box! It was so yellow and dirty. I could have bought this brand new for $3.00 more. I just thought the seller was honest about the condition of this book, I have bought several used books on Amazon from other vendors,and they have been true to their listing! Very disappointed with this vendor!"
1,Missing Disk!,I was very upset with the product I received. After opening and beginning to listen to the CDs I realized that I had two copies of disk 2 and none of disk 3. This error should not have occurred. I would hope that a copy of disk 3 would be sent to me at no charge since I have already paid for the entire book. No one would buy a book if part of it was missing. It is the same expectation should be applied to audio books.
5,Ages 9-12? Hah!,"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is one of those rare children's books that seems to be utterly wasted on children. The plot is engaging, the characters are likeable, and it's a good quick read for those older than the specified ages. I'm 18, and I finished it in a few hours, then handed it to my mother, who is 39. After she finished it, she agreed that we needed to get the rest of the series. In a family that regularly reads Shakespeare, that's high praise! It's a refreshing and enjoyable way to get your mind off the overly serious Muggle world and bring back a bit of wonder and magic. If you're a parent considering getting this book for your child, please do... But get a copy for yourself as well, and enjoy revisiting your own childhood."
5,First book of the series and one of the most amazing ones.,"Through reading the first book of the series again, I can't help but fall into the magical world yet again. This is the first of seven books to kick off such an amazing series and pulls you right in, thus creating the need and desire to read the rest yet again."
4,Not really for children,"I am 52. I liked the book a lot. I'm reading them all, even though the news says that J.K. Rowling may have borrowed very heavily from a 1984 book of someone else's. Still, the books are great fun. I feel, however, that certain things are not for children's hearts and minds. For example, at least three times in this book, malevolent characters sneer at Harry Potter that his parents died violent deaths and that they deserved it. This in my mind is not fare for eight years olds. It is fairly violent and scary reading for youngsters. I'm having a great time reading them all, but I won't give it to any children I know."
3,"Very Cute Story, But Why Is It So Popular?","This book was a fun read, with an imaginative flair. However, the plot was more episodic than integral and the characters were dull stereotypes. I'm not sure why it's so popular, but anything that gets kids reading is OK in my book. With regard to its magical content: religious persons might want to remember that magic isn't real."
5,Superb,"What a splendidly imaginative book. Only those with the most closed of minds could rate this book anything less than five stars. Harry Potter an unloved and unwanted child enters a wonderfully exciting world of magic and finds friendship, acceptance, and a sense of self. It is a wonderful book which can teach children the value of self-love and self-worth. Of developing good friendships and accepting those who aren't exactly the same as everyone else. Everyone belongs no matter who you are. Kudos to Rowling for an absolute gem of a book. From a devoted and caring christian Mother who is careful about the materials I allow my children to read, this rates right up there with Charlies & The Chocolate Factory, and The Hobbit. BRAVO!"
4,Great,"Awesome. Amazing piece. Suspense, action, it was an awesome book. I loved this book. I recommend it to everyone. Its a great book."
3,Harry potter and the sorcerers stone,I rated it like this because I wanted to.It was good in the end of the book just because
5,Great read!,Now I understand the fascination with this series :) Looking forward to the next book and also seeing the movie.
4,Another classic,My favorite Harry Potter book ever! I remember reading this book in the 5th grade with my class and falling in love with it. I believe every kid should read this.
5,Harry Poter is probably the bestbook of all time,"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone has no dry parts. It is surely the best book I ever read.With a mix of adventure,mystery and fantasy, J.K. Rowling wisps us away into a world of unicorns,wizards,and flying broomsticks.I recommend it to everyone."
5,Simply magnificent!,"I have read a lot of books, but ""Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone"" amazed me. Even though it's supposed to be a book for younger people, I found it incredibly funny and extraordinary. J.K. Rowling has with this book written a masterpiece."
5,the beginning of a classical series,"J. K. Rowling introduces to us in this fabulous story, the tale of a young boy who is anything but average. You see Harry is a wizard who has been sent to live with his muggle relatives after the death of his parents. His relatives try to thwart his becoming a wizard by any means possible. This causes Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to send Hagrid the game keeper to bring him to Hogwarts and thus begins the magical tale of how a young oppressed boy finds friendships, danger, and a mortal ememy who wants nothing less than his death. This is the fast paced tale of a high-flying sport, Quidditch, potions and spells, and intrigue where things are not what they seem. Highly recommended as the start of a classical series."
5,One of the Best books EVER turned into a movie!!,I saw all the movies first so I was kind of worried the movies weren't going to be like the books but they are!!!! I loved it a must read for everybody!!!!
5,A true insperation! It Rocks!,"Hagrid, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, all dazzlin' characters that are unique and beautiful in their own way. Harry is not the kind of person that you would find appealing, but he is brilliant! From the name to his powers it's all no.1! I couldn't put this book down! It is true inspiration, with curiously tingling words that tickle your imagination! Just fabulous!"
4,Still great reading,I haven't read all the books in sequence before. I'm grown up now but still this book keeps its merits!
5,Great characters in an Excellent Book,"The first series of the Harry Potter books, the Sorcerer's Stone, is quite an amazing story to the world of magic. Filled with the coolest spell to the funniest experience, you will even laugh to yourself while reading this book. At the beginning, Harry was living with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and his not-so-good cousin, Dudley. After Hagrid came to tell him that he is a wizard, his life changed. He met Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger at the Hogwarts Express; You've to go straight to a wall between Platform 9 and 10!! Which is why it's called Platform 9 3/4.He and his new best friends, from Gryffindor, went to numerous adventure to get to the sorcere's stone. Read it...while stocks last!!"
4,Tommy Smith Harry Potter and the Sorcarors Stone,I thick it is good.But it should be more real.The three headed dog is dum.It should be a one headed dog.The cloak is cool.
4,Go Harry Go,Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone (book one) is simply outstanding. It is a captivating best-selling novel that is all-inspiring for all ages. I am not a reader and as soon as I started reading I refused to put it down. You will instantly find a favorite character and living Harry's life from the first word to the last. You will laugh and sometimes even feeling very sorry for Harry. J.K. Rowling slowly reels you in and you get to know every character like a friend...or foe.As for the movie it is great as it follows the book and can even be more thrilling at times. However I reccomend you read the book before you see the movie.And after you finish the Sorcerer's Stone you may want to sink your Muggle teeth into the equally terrific sequels. I say start reading now.
5,HARRY POTTER,"Rowlings first book is a real gem. You meet Harry and his closest friends, and you learn how his story began. It's a really quick read, and by JK Rowlings standards is a short book. As are all of her Harry Potter books this one is totally original and the characters just jump off the page. I always suggest anyone being introduced to the series to read them in order..and to read them before you see any of the movies. The movies are really good, but dont compare to the books and Ms. Rowlings great writing. The gentleman who reads the books on audio, Jim Dale is fantastic, he makes the characters really pop, and his Hagrid is hilarious. As for as the books go id rate them...* The Goblet of Fire* The Prisoner of Azkaban* The Half Blood Prince* The Sorcerer's Stone* The Chamber of Secrets* The Order of the Pheonixbut really they are all good in their own way..I mean I consider them all five star books."
5,HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE,"This story is about a boy who's parents died in what he thought was a car crash. Now at 11 he finds out 1, he's a wizard, and 2, his parents were killed by another wizard while they tried to protect him from death.Now he knows why he must say with his Aunt and Uncle.He goes to a school called Hogwarts,makes two great friends,and plays a game called Quidditch. Oh, ya also the wizard that killed his parents is trying to kill him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Harry potter year one,Book is a classic and the perfect set up for a timeless series. I recommend it to anyone looking for an escape :)
3,Critique of survey,"ReviewPurchase review project interesting, and included some now-forgotten items. I would appreciate some feedback from the results of the profile, as compared with other buyers of the same item."
5,"Great for kids, teens, geezers and fogies","It's not often that a new series comes out that captures its audience in such a magnificent way as Harry Potter. This series has influenced many other writers, including Stephen King! It has helped children to bond with adults in a fun and magical way. It has introduced a new world to all who read.In the first book of this series, we are introduced to many of the main characters that play a crucial role in Harry's life. We travel to Hogwarts, a school of Magic where truth be told, I think many of us would like to attend. We meet deep characters, some good and some bad and we learn of magical villages that can be accessed only by those ""in the know.""If you haven't done so already, make the HP series part of your library and share it with your children, friends and family."
4,Great Introduction,"Even though thisbook starts slow at first and may even be a little boring at first, keep reading. I promise it will be very exciting at the end. It is a grat introduction to Harry, Hogwarts, and Harry's friends. Well written."
4,Harry Potter,"The book Harry Potter by J.K Rowling is a good book. The main characters in the book were Harry Potter, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley's and their son Dudly. The setting of the book mostly took place in the Dursley's house. In the begining of the book Harry Potter get's sent to his reletive's the Dursley's,and he really doesn't like it that much because they didn't treat him right so that's why he didn't like them that much. Harry finds out that he is a wizard. At his school he wanders around and gets in trouble. There was a lot of action and suspense through out this book. The ending was a very surprising and made me want to read the next book to see what happens next. I recommend this book for any age group. You will find this book interesting and fun to read."
2,It's the content that concerns me,"My son was introduced to this book in his 3rd grade class. Because it was so well rated, and included in the school curriculum, my wife decided to purchase it for bedtime reading. After reading several chapters, I developed a concern that portraying witchcraft, wizardry, and sorcery as normative, positive and embraceable was inappropriate for the impressionable mind of a nine-year old."
2,not deeply imaginative,"I had hoped, given the reviews I read, that this would be a book great for bedtime reading to my two sons. I bought the book and started to read at night. I had a hard time keeping interested. And my sons lost interest shortly into the book. Just not a lot of new characters or story line to speak of. Seems to be a lot of rehashing of other better written books. Dialog of characters very elementary. And I know this is a kids book, but not too much stimulating converstation. I am sorry that I seem to be an outsider in my opinion of this book, but I think my standard for ""great book"" might be a tad bit different than prior reviewers."
5,LOVE,I just love these books! Such a brilliant story!I've even had some of my questions answered! Looking forward to the next six books.
3,Parents wanting to buy this for their child read this one,"This book has too many names, they are too long and too hard to remember! I am not saying the book is bad, it is just that it isn't a great choice for readers under the age of 9 or 10! This book is wonderfully written, but if you want to buy this for your daughter or son, make sure they are pretty good at pronouncing long and confusing names and words. They will ask you how to pronounce many words. Overall, you should buy this for your daughter or son, if they are:1) 9 and up2) Good readers3) pronounce words well4) willing to read a long book"
5,2nd Copy of Book 1,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I wore out my first copy of these discs and could not go without one. This was so much cheaper than going to a store where you have to be lucky to find one. The box was a little worn but the product is perfect. Thanks, Harry and I can continue to be friends. By the way I'm a retired school teacher and have seen kids go from being uninterested in reading to avid readers thanks to the Harry Potter series. I've even seen kids start with listening to the audios first to wanting to read it for themselves. These books, audios, movies didn't sell millions for nothing. They teach could moral living and values like few books have ever done. Donna Hicks"
4,Very good book,"It is a very good book, very entertaining and original. It also talks a lot about values. Once you started you can not stop reading it."
5,Hi,It's goodHajajjzjzjzjzjzjjzjzjzjxjxhh Hajajjzjzjzjzjzjjzjzjzjxjxhhnk. Nd j j j j hmmmm j j. Is j j j k k k k
4,Taking a Chance,When I first heard about the Harry Potter books I was very reluncant about reading them. I criticized the books continously and wondered why people read such junk. After deciding to just read one of the books I was hooked. Each page allowed me to explore the world of this young teen dealing with so much pain and adversity. Each chapter encouraged you to read on and find out what will happen next. I enjoyed how the book was so greatly put together. I appericate J.K. Rowling for making a book so freshly written. Some of the ideas and setting were tied into real life. So it doesn't feel like you are reading a fairy tale. The issues focused on in the book are so world wide that any age can read the book and enjoy it. I encourage anyone who doesn't like the book to just try it. It made my a fan.
5,Good,It's was a very good book and kept me guessing. I can't wait to read the second book of the series!
4,Harry Potter and the sorcerer 's stone,"I have been waiting for these books to come out on e-reader for a long time. I am new to reading Harry Potter,even though I have watched all the movies. I enjoyed the book and I am going to buy the next one."
5,Loved it,It was all I expected and more. Great read!!! I would recommend to everyone. Can't wait to start the next book.
5,Awesome!!!!!,"I agree with many people on here who said that there were many stereotypical things about this book but you know this is a really good book because I looked right at these problems and said ""you know what, I really don't care!"" and continued reading one of the best books that I have read in a while:)"
5,This is the best book I've read!!,"When my mom gave me this book I was at first thinking ""Oh, another book that won't go on my bookshelf with my favorite books."" But I was wrong. I like the plot of the book and the way she describes everything and everyone in a detailed way. I also love the charectors names, and I hope there are many more coming!"
3,This would be the perfect cartoon....,A very cute children's book. Reccomended for people who don't like very wordy novels. Also a must read for young adults! Harry Potter is very enchanting.
3,Not as good as the hype,"While the book is pretty good, I think it doesn't live up to its hype. I hear Book 2 is better, so maybe the series improves. I thought the middle of the book dragged a little, and by the end I was just wanting to finish it."
5,A magical journey for all ages!,"I was very sceptical as I listened to all the hype about this series. Not being one for 'fads,' I paid little attention to this one. However, I took my little sister to see the movie, and I was very impressed, and was inspired to give the book a try. I did, and to my amazement I couldn't put it down! I started reading the first book Tuesday night... it's Monday, and I finished the third book this afternoon! I absolutally love them. I recomend everyone, whether interested in fantasty (which I am not) books, or not, pick up a copy and give it a try, I guarantee anyone with an imagination will appreciate this series! Bravo Rowling!"
5,BEST BOOK EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is filed with action and adventure I really liked it you should to it was awesome just read it
5,great book,Brought it as a christmas gift... I love it when I read it years ago and hope the recipient will too!
1,Book was ruined.,I received this product and every page was absolutely inundated in unintellegible ink stains. There were no pictures and the kid on the cover looks like an idiot. WHAT DO THE MARKINGS MEAN? I will never purchase any book like this again.
2,A Potpourri,"The book's strength is putting characters from Germanic, Scandinavian, and other European fairy tales into one story and making it readable, and accessible to non-European readers. JKR gets 2 stars."
5,It's a great book!,"It has lots of words. The movies misses a lot of the good parts of the story found in the book. My 6 year old son is helping to write this review. On the cover of the book , harry potter looks different from the way he looks in the movies. My son looks forward to me reading a chapter to him every night."
3,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Om,"WHAT IS IT? A mark on the forehead? A hidden shopping precinct? A current of air? Brooms flying in your head? Your eyes roving amongst the maps at Hogwarts?It's all of these. But it goes so deep. The portrait you see is Harry Potter lost in the middle of a big, big cosmos that you don't grasp easily and that you don't control either. And who is Harry Potter?He's you!"
2,WHAT DOES UNABRIDGED MEAN REALLY MEAN?,"I ordered this book for a Japanese learner of English who found the finer print of the original edition too daunting. Although the front matter of the large print edition says the original work is unabridged in this edition, it is certainly not the entire original material. I found that to be a disappointment."
1,false advertising,"I had to give one star because there is no such catagory as zero starts, which is what this quack deserves. This product was supposedly a first edition, first print of Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone. Firstly, it is not a first edition or first print of the book, and secondly, it was large print, which was not advertised. We are very disturbed by the false advertising and plan on returning the book for a full refund."
3,Wish I Could've Seen It,"I'm a big Harry Potter movie fan. I was looking forward to The Half Blood Prince, but the quality of the DVD was so poor that many scenes were too dark. It was impossible to see what was going on. Too bad. I think I would've enjoyed it."
3,It's good for kids.,"My girlfriend loved this book, but I couldn't take 2 paragraphs. I loved the movies so I suppose the books are probably good(for the intended audience) if they sprang the movies. The few sentences I read though were very very much geared for a younger audience."
3,Average Book for 4th to 6th Graders,"I am completely perplexed by the number of adults who love Harry Potter. After hearing so much hype for the past few years I picked up the first one and think it's an okay children's book. I guess it is as good as many of the books I read at the age of 8 or 9, such as THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH, A CRICKET IN TIMES SQUARE, and JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, but not much better.I have nothing against the book, but after reading the first one I still have no idea what all the hype is about."
2,Decent fantasy...?,"I had mixed fellings while reading ""Harry Potter"".On one hand I felt that this is decent fantasy book with exciting action and shallow meaning. On the other hand it felt like some kind of unhealthy mix of C.S. Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and Le Guin's ""A Wizard of Earthsea"". If you are familiar with those books i would not recomend ""Harry Potter"" to you, it will feel all too familiar. If you are unfamiliar with the genre of fantasy -- ""Harry Potter"" books will give you a nice intoduction."
5,The Real Deal.,"I strongly disagree with another readers point of view, and just wanted to put in my two cents. First off, the Reader says that the book uses the word ""Kill"" in a very real sense. Whereas the bible details Soldiers nailing Jesus to across, slashing his side and placing a wine covered sponge onto the wound. It also details a crown of thorns placed around his head. I ask of you this, which would rather have your fifth grader read."
5,Wizard Wanted!,"Harry Potter lives with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and thier son,Dudly.Harry is treated very badly, a lot from Dudly, like getting beat up and getting wacked with Dudly's stick. But, his aunt and uncle are always picking on him, they don't even remember Harry's birthday! On Harry's eleventh birthday they leave thier houseand go to a cottage. Thats when Harry meets Hagrid and finds out he's a wizard and he's been accepted into Hogwarts School of Wichcraft and Wizardry! In my opinian, this book is exelent."
5,So much to do!,"I love how much stuff there is to do in Hogwarts. Something new and exciting is always going on, whether it's finding a mirror that shows what you most desire, playing a game of Quidditch above hundreds of cheering students, or solving magical riddles to stop a dark wizard.And Rowling's storytelling skills are amazing."
5,I HATE TO READ!,I don't know if I hate to read or just don't.... I'm 31 years old and have read less that a hand full of books and then only kicking and screaming... After the first 3-5 chapters of harry potter I didn't want to put it down.... I'm a slow reader and actually would read the book outloud to my wife. I READ IT TWICE and when the fourth book came out I was excited that is had over 700 pages!!!Thanks you J.K.
5,"Narly, bodashis, tubular, cool, radical, and awsome","This was the best book I have ever read. It hooks you and makes you want to read it when ever you can. It leaves you hanging on every word they say as Ron, Harry and Hermione go on many dangereous journeys. I've only read the first two and the very second I finished I was all ready craving for another. It makes you feel like your really there. I recomend this book to people who like reading funny, mysterious books and who read so much that their eyes hurt before they go to bed."
5,love it,I listen to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone while commuting to work which helps me go on with my day. And I also listen to this on my way back home to unwind. Travaling 2 hours back and forth from home to work helps pass the time.
4,enjoyable,"The Harry Potter books are one of my all-time favorite series' for both children and adults. This book, the first one, is no exception. Highly enjoyable. It has a slow start, but a beginning that many in this world can relate too. It opens the minds of the readers and lets them consider possibilities that they'd never thought of before.I won't reveal the plot of this story, but it's good. I will say, though, that it is nothing compared to the books that follow. I honestly think that the Harry Potter books get better and better as they go. In this there were times that it got a bit boring, but not enough to put it down.I would strongly recommend buying this book. I did...you should too. There's a reason it stayed on the New York Times Best Sellers list for so long.Not the best by J.K. Rowling, but still very good."
5,I was blown away by this book!,"I have easily read more than a thousand books in my 30 years-- classics and Pulitzer Prize winners, mostly-- and I do not remember being so taken by a character as I am by Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling has created a masterpiece that would recommend without hesitation to anyone of any age."
3,Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone,"Book was purchased used-good. It was missing cover. I would not have bought book if I had known cover was missing. Otherwise, book is in good shape and arrived on time."
3,Book,Thought was buying Anniversary Edition but that is not what I received. NO response from seller; book was in perfect condition just not right copy.
5,This is the best book I ever read.,"Harry Potter is a very funny book. It has a lot of cool magic in it. I especially like the quidich matches they play. Harry's position is ""The Seeker"". He tries to catch the golden snitch. My favorite character is Professor Dumbledor."
5,Charming!,"This book is a great break from the stresses of the real world. I love the characters and the story. Harry Potter's aunt and uncle are absolutely the worst relatives one could imagine, but are funny at the same time. Hogwarts reminds me of school camps, although, we never had beans of every flavor...which may be a good thing. I am definitely going to read every Harry Potter book I can get my hands on!"
5,Escapism par excellance,A number of people I know were talking about this book. At the time I didn't know it was a children's book. But I looked for it and found it and read it. I was amazed! It's wonderful. Not only is the story fun but it's so well written that I couldn't put it down! I then read the 2nd book and it was just as good as the first. Try it you'll love it. Where was this author when I was a child?
5,Well worth it.,"I hesitated about buying this copy of this book seeing as I already have a couple copies of it here. I'm very glad I did. I loved the little hand-drawn picture of Snape by JKR and the full-page color picture of the adventure across the Black Lake. Those features aside, I reread the story and forgot just how magical and wonderful it is. In comparison to the later books, it is a quick read and I forgot how much I love it."
3,A pretty good fantasy,"I picked this up on the theory that if it's banned in South Carolina, there must be something good about it. And it was an entertaining read. I'm a little scared of the people who claim it's the ""best book ever written,"" but I'd read more (in paperback. Rowling's prose may not be up to the standard of C.S. Lewis', but I didn't feel like I was being hit over the head with her religion, or like screaming because of the 1940's-era sexism. Not bad, especially for kids."
5,What a fun filled and creative book for all ages!,"This was such a great book for all ages. I am 19 and I thought it was one of the best books I have ever read. I read it in one day. This is a book that you can't put down. After reading the book, I made my mother read it, and she loved it also. This would be a good book to read to your kids before they go to be."
4,"Great Book, but not Godlike","I think this book is very good. The plot was fun and unpredictable, and the characters are all exciting to relate to. However, unlike ""The Three Musketeers"",or some classics, it's not incredible literature. Thankyou for the fun adventure of reading your book Mrs. Rowling, it's a work of art."
4,Harry Potter and the Sorcrerer's Stone,"In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone J.K. Rowling uses setting and suspense very well. Rowling sets up the book on Privette Drive. This is home to the Dursleys who are Harry's relatives. Rowling shows in great detail how the Dursleys act and how hard it is to live with them. Rowling also uses suspense to get the reader involved in the book. I didn't want to put the book down. I will admit that in the beginning though the book was rather stale. It takes too long to get to the exciting parts in the book. One of the most suspensful parts is when Harry has to face Voldemort in the end to try and save the Sorcerer's Stone, and all of the wizarding world. This was a very good book, and Rowling does a very good job using these literary devices to get the reader involved in the book."
5,Loved it!,"I just recently discovered the Harry Potter series. This is a great book, fun to read for adults and kids."
5,An Instant Classic,"J.K.Rowlings has done it. She made an entire society that co-exists with the one that we live in without the people of the ""mugle"" society not knowing. It makes you wonder whether this is fiction !"
5,It would be a good book for children and adults,Harry Potter is an excellent book. I would reccomend it over The Chronicles of Narnia or any other related book. I would also reccomend Holes.
5,After I read it once I had to read again!,I hope they come out with a movie soon! Why can't there be 10 books
4,GREAT BOOK!!!,"The book Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is about a boy named Harry. Harry's parents died when he was just a young baby, presently Harry lives with his aunt, uncle, and his cousin Dudley.One day while at home Harry gets a letter, but for some strange reason Harrys uncle won't let him see it or read it. Mysteriously the letters just keep coming and coming. The letter is from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry finally gets his hands on that letter and discovers that he is a Wizard.Will Harry go to the Hogwarts School and become a true Wizard, find out. Don't let the size of the book intimedate you. I did until I read it in class for silent reading and loved it, I recommended it to everybody I know. I rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars. Enjoy."
5,Great start to series,"The Sorcerer's Stone is a great start to this long running series about Witches and Wizards. I just started reading the series in 2005 after 'Goblet of Fire' came out in theatres, and I loved each of these from start to finish. Sorcerer's Stone was so much fun that I finished it in a couple of days. I'm not a fast reader, but this one was just great. I highly recommend this kid-friendly book as a bedtime story, or even a quick read on a vacation to get yourself started in the series. J.K. Rowling hits a homerun in the opener."
4,Not the Best of 'em-but need to read,"The stories of Harry Potter are definitely some of the most original and creative stories I've read. This first novel introduces the ideas and characters very well yet once you've read the other books of the series, you will see how this is certainly not the best. When I finished this book (as well as the second one-The Chamber of Secrets) I thought that it was a very well writen children's story. It's almost like a fairy tale. It's not until later that it changes a bit to show that there actually are some serious issues in this fantasy world. I would definitely recomend this book but just know that if you aren't that impressed with it (or the next one), keep going. It gets better than this."
5,This book lives up to the hype!!!,"I wanted to know what the hype was all about!! So, I decided to check a couple of pages out, then ""BOOM!!!"", next thing I knew I was hooked. I couldn't believed that this book drew me in so easily!!! I was amazed and excited while I read and that doesn't happened to me often!! I must admit, I saw the movie first and I can't believe that the movie followed the book pretty well!! This book reminds of a modern Cinderella with a twist. The main character is a male, Harry, who is treated wicked but his Aunt, Uncle & porky cousin Dudley. Later, realizing he is someone special by people that are unknown to him (the witch & wizard society) and he is someone already famous!!! Now, what kid wouldn't want to be famous!!! This is an awesome read, I would recommend this to anyone not just children."
4,Midnight Magic,"The book Midnight Magic is a really good book if you like,tarot card readings, magic, secrets, romance,and thrills. The Old magician in this book was almost prosecuted for doing ""magic"", as the king would say. He tried to tell the king that the so called ""magic"" that he did was nothing mearly tricks and something to make a living out of. The kings most trusted advisor let him be in the debt of the king. The king later found out that he needed a favor from the old magician. mangus ( the magician) is faced with a problem that he cant solve because he really isen't a magician, just a entertainer. The king won't beleive him and if the problem isen't solved, than he will be excecuted at once. These are just alittle of what happenes in the book. As you can see there are always problems that occur and its not boring at all. You always are woundering what is goin to happen next and you dont want to put down the book untill you see. This why i like, ""Midnight Magic."""
3,"Sweet Summer, Bebe Cambel","Sweet Summer is about how the author, Bebe, grew up knowing and not fuly knowing her father. Every summer Bebe went down South with daddy where life was completely different than with her mother in the North. Everythign was 'easy living' as she put it, where you could run down the lane in yoru bare feet, pump water and boil it for a hot bath,and where ain't wasn't a word momma could yell at you for. As much as I had enjoyed the book, it stirred up a few emmotions i had though hidden as it became more clear exactly how much she idolized her handicapped father Through different flashbacks of the summers they had shared an the laughs they enjoyed though her youth and well into her adult and mother hood. A must have novel for every ""softie"" out there."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone,"I couldn't ask for a more satifying novel in months! It has everything that a person needs, action, drama, and a GREAT plot. The more JK writes the better the story gets, I often find that rare in books today esp. in children lit. I couldn't put it down, and I had to read it more than once... DEFINATELY should the one to buy."
5,Dale's Performance Extraordinary,"In reviewing the cassette edition earlier, I neglected to mention the incredible performance of Mr. Dale - which is what prompted me to review the edition in the first place!While encouraging kids to read is, of course, hugely important, the performance by Mr. Dale is so entertaining that it warrants purchasing BOTH the book and the cassette editions for your children. The many characters are easily identifiable with Mr. Dale's wide range of British/Scottish accents, and they are brought to life by his treatment. As well, Americans will appreciate hearing the proper pronounciation of ""Her-MY-oh-nee"" (not ""Hermy-WON"") and other British names. I'm very impressed with the quality of the performance and am anxious to purchase other cassette editions of the series."
5,Harry Potter begins,It was two years ago when i first heard about Harry Potter. Now I am a true fan of all wizards and witches alike (with the exception of a few you know who they are). When I first began reading these books it was just to read; now it's more of a hobby I have read all five books that have been released and am in the process of buying them. I have also seen the first three movies and find them just as good as the books and everything is exactly how i pictured it. I would recommend this book and the others that have been published so far to anyone.
4,Harry Potter And The Sorcerer`s Stone,"The first positive thing is that a book for everybody, and the children don`t watch the tv all the time: it is a good way for children start reading because they will intend to read other novels as well.It is very easy to read, and very enjoyable it stimulate our imagination."
4,a really good book,"It's a really good book for both children and grown-ups. Try it, just try and you will like it."
3,Meh,"When J. K. Rowling wrote this book, she still wasn't in the writing style and was just... average!!! This book is a very worth while read, but still is missing something. PLEASE, decide for yourself, but NOT ANYTHING like the other Potter books. AVERAGE."
3,"Good at first, but...","When I first read Harry Potter, I thought it was really good. Then, after a while, I saw how thin the plot was. It is ok, but it has no life. It is not a book you would want to keep forever. If you want to read some really good classics, I would recommend The Chronicles of Narnia."
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,I am 8 years old and I think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an extraordinary book.I think it's the best book in the series so far because it's the scariest. I think the last book in the series should be called Harry Potter versus Draco Malfoy.
5,A muggle's view into the world of wizardry!,"Oh, wow! This was one of the BEST books that I've yet read! (and you can believe me, I've read ALOT!) Rowlings makes you feel like you could have actually be there not to mention she gives the characters very good personalities and real life problems that all kids face...not to mention some that you'd never even think of!"
5,Sparked Interest in Reading,"I first heard of Harry Potter's books from my mother. She suggested that my 14 year old son read one of them. I knew my son was more interested in computer games and skateboarding and had no interest whatsoever in reading. I did buy the Sorcerer's Stone book, hoping that I could find a way to get him to read it. I made a deal with him. If he read a chapter in the book, he could have the computer. At first, he fought it saying no way was he going to read this silly children's book. But, I stuck to my guns and he sat down and started reading. Right now, he is on his last chapter and he just asked me to order the next two books for him. Hurray for Harry Potter!"
3,Chris Mata review,"Harry and the Sorcerer Stone By J.K Rowling is a very interesting book. If you like books with magic and adventure I recommend ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone.""This book is very interesting because a kid named Harry lost his parents because a evil wizard killed them but right as his mom was going to die she put a protection spell on Harry. Harry is living with relatives, but they don't treat him as one of them. Harry's uncle didn't like him very much, They went to the zoo one day and his uncle's son accidentally fell into the cage of he snake when Harry looked at the glass.I recommend this book because it is exciting and it has lots of adventure's. The author has a lot of imagination and I like that. The author wrote this book as if he wanted to escape the world and live in his own."
5,It is good,"It is good and new book. I get this book from day which i order to i get book, only few day. it is fast."
5,"This was a ""horrible"" book? Not REALLY!","I just said it was a horrible book to get your attention! It was an amazingly beautiful book, with the suspense in the right places. A boy named Harry Potter (DUH) has been living with the horrible Dursleys for years now. His mother and father were killed in a ""car accident"". THe Dursleys are horrible and hate Harry. One day, a letter addressed to Harry arrives on their front steps. And then just like that, Harry meets Hagrid and learns all about the wizarding world, and also that he is a wizard. His parents were killed by a horrible wizard named Voldemort He is off to the wizarding school, Hogwarts, and there he comes across a frightening and suspenseful mystery."
5,Great!,"I would like to tell all you people out there that this is the best series of books I have ever read,and believe me,I have read a lot of books! It is imaginative and interesting. It just makes you wish you were there and was one of them. The series is about a boy,after living 10 years with his aunt and uncle,he finds out that he has wizarding blood and is invited to go to Hogwarts, a wizarding school. It tells of his adventures and life at Hogwarts. I HIGHLY recommend this book to people of all ages. It is easy to read but is enjoyable for all ages."
4,Harry Potter's First Adventure,"11 year old Harry Potter's parents are dead, and he lives with the Dursleys, a family that hates Harry. But when he gets a letter, he is told that his parents were murdered by a wizard, known as Lord Voldemort. When Harry is accepted into a school for young witches and wizards, he finds out that a teacher is trying to help Voldemort gain immortality. Now Harry must try to stop Voldemort from gaining the power to become immortal, or suffer dearly for it."
5,This book is adventurous everytime you turn the page.,this book was sort of scarey but it was also exciting ! I thought also that it was very funny.
4,David's review,"I really enjoyed Harry Potter's books. The book is about a boy who is a wizard. He goes to school to develop his magical ablities. He plays Quiditch for the school. In the end he has to battle his arch enemy, Voldevort. I really enjoyed the book. I think anyone can read this book. It's really fun and you will enjoy it from start to finish. I have never read a book similiar to it. The only draw back is it is a little bit long. But I will recomend it to anyone."
5,For all ages,I'm 30 and I loved this book. I would encourage people of all ages to read all of the Harry Potter books. For kids it is an adventure. For adults it is a great get-away.
3,O.K.,"Harry Potter isn't the worst book I have ever found, but it's no 'Wonder book.' I believe J.K Rowling has a good sense of humour and her writing is fairly good. While she has enhanced the wizarding world more then most authors care to, a lot of it is just a mix of old fables. But her characters are one dimesional. Harry Potter- the shy, neglected child who really doesn't want all the attention. Hermione Granger- book worm. Ron Weasley- angry red head. Draco Malfoy- Annoying prat. You get the idea. An O.K. book."
5,Sha-ZAM! Zounds! Superb! Phenomenal!,"What an excellent novel! Having heard about this exalted book, I read it. In one sitting. Not that it's short, but that it's . . . WONDERFUL! I nearly laughed out loud at the stupid antics of the Dursleys, and shared Harry's every emotion. This is a thriller, an adventure, a wonder! Every plot twist jerks you in another direction. And I feel that the 9-12 age level is unjust - - I'm 13 and am a loyal fan. But that's no biggie; my mom has read the books and can't wait for #4! Hurry up, J.K. Rowling!"
3,Good book!,"J.K. Rowling is a poignant author and this is an example of a fast paced book, worth its price, the character development shines and dialogue is sparkling, a favorite of mine!"
5,Captivating,"Having seen the Harry Potter movies, I decided to start in on the books. I could not put this one down. The plots and story lines are not complicated but they are completely captivating. Looking forward to the next one."
5,An rad book!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I never used to like to read but when my friends said it was a great book I took it out of our libary and every day I couldn't wait to get home from school and read I finished It in like 2 or 3 days it was rad every body should read it.
4,Wonderful Book for young and old alike,"I picked up this book along with book 2 about 2 days ago. I was planning on using them next year as I am a teacher and thought my kids would like to hear the story. Boy was I amazed! Not only was the story completely fun and exciting, it had me up late finishing it. Harry Potter is the perfect kind of hero for a children's story and all will be cheering for him through his many adventures and problems at Hogwarts school and with his Muggle family he is forced to live with. I am now reading book 2 The Chamber of secrets and can't wait to purchase book 3 which is already out, and book 4 due to come out on July 8! If you like interesting stories, filled with adventure, hilarity, and magic you will love the Harry Potter series."
4,wonderful,"I enjoyed this book almost as much as my children did. Undersized,bullied and generally downtrodden Harry Potter is actually a wizard and a famous one too! His first year at wizard school, especially the breath-taking quidditch matches make for edge-of-the-seat reading. All this said, if you grew up reading Diana Wynne Jones (Charmed Life, Eight Days of Luke, Magicians of Caprona and others),as I did, you'd say a lot of it's been done before and done a bit better. Hence the four stars. But I'm still among the first in line for each sequel."
5,"Harry Potter Books 1, 2, & 3","I am a 25 year old reader with a BA in English Literature and I have to say that these are some of the most enjoyable and well-written books of any era that I have read. While they may have originally been intended to be children's literature, they have completely surpassed all of their author's expectations and that of their readers. They are sure to become classics. I am one of the thousands that have pre-ordred Book 4 from Amazon and I'm anxiously awaiting its release."
3,Imagination never has its limits.,Harry has enchanted me. It is such a great book it deverves 100 stars. R.J rowling was done a great job. Harry Potter makes people wonder what kind of mind the author had to write that book. Harry streches peoples minds. It makes tham think that anthing can happen and it can in Harry Potter. It is a book that no one can stop reading.
5,This Book Rocked!!!!!,When I read this book I was stuned!!! It kept wanting to read this book because it had a lot of suspense. I congragulate J.K. Rowling and Mary Grandpre on this book I think it has a good plot and good illustrations I am looking forward to getting the seqel.
4,Sorcerer's Stone,"A wonderful, rich, humorous, adventure. The Greatest book I read. I went to see the movie before I read the book. After the movie, me and my mom had to stop at the store. I asked if I could have the book. The Movie was excellent; 31/2 Stars. But the book changed my life. I thought after seeing the movie nothing could be better, then I read the book. I was amazed at how J.K Rowling could tie so many different elements into a book. The great novel had me racing through the pages wanting more and getting it. Easily, the most incredible fantsy novel ever. The book that started it all. Congrats to JK Rowling for being an exellent author, and keep up the good work."
4,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneBy: J. RowlingReviewed by: [...]Period: 2This book is about a boy named Harry Potter learning about his past and who was his parents. He also learns how to do magic. Such as Fly on a broom or do potions. He also goes to a school called Hogwarts to learn about magic.I liked this book because of its ups and downs with the story line. Like this Quote"" ... yes- ! broomsticks!we've got catch the key to the door!"" I also like the part about harry getting a letter and then leters pour in because he didn't get to read one.I dislike the parts of the book when it was boring. Like in the begining. i didn't relly get it.My most favorite part of the book is when Hagrid comes and breaks down the door of the light house and gives Harry the letter about Hogwarts"
4,A Fantasy Reader,"Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone is about a young boy living with his rude and stuck up aunt and uncle because his parents were ""supposedly"" killed in a car crash. On his eleventh birthday, Harry receives mysterious letters that Uncle Vernon will not stop ripping up. Harry travels with his aunt and uncle to a shack out in the middle of the ocean. A giant of a man, by the name of Hagrid, finds Harry and gives him a letter personally. Harry soon finds a secret about himself he didn't even know, and about what really happened to his parents.I enjoyed this book very much, and I recommend this book to any one."
4,i was shockeed,This book was excellant. My little brother read it and said it was really good so o read it. It was amazing. it was the best book i read that was from the kids section. He weaves a web that makes you really see Harry like he is a kid. I loved the book and i highly recomend it.
5,"a must for everyone, young and old",just like the rest of the world i fell in love with Harry Potter as soon as i opened the first book. well written and surprising twists. a book that one can not put down!
4,A Late Bloomer....,"I've just recently started reading this series, and I have to admit that I have been very entertained. This book was a bit ""young"" I noticed in the writing, but understandably so, since the main character is only 11. Since I had seen the movie before I'd read this, I didn't have very many surprises, but all in all, it was worth the read."
4,Great Start,"A perfect start to a wonderful series. I must admit I read the Chamber of Secrets before I read this novel, but then again I got hooked on Harry Potter by Dobby the House Elf!"
5,BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD,PARENTS: WANT YOUR KIDS TO GET INTO READING???I AM 13 AND I PERSONALY HATE READING. MY MOTHER TOLD ME ABOUT THE BOOK AND I RELUCTANTLY STARTED IT. BEFORE I KNEW IT I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I WAS HOOKED. TRULY AMAZING BOOK. KIDS WILL LOVE IT.
5,The Best Book,"Although I am only 10 I'm a great reader for my age. Even a 140 page book I can read in 2 hours. I've been waiting for a long, but entertaining, book. Every nice, long novel is either boring, or hard to follow. But then I found the Scorcerer's Stone, a long, exciting, easy to follow, book. I read it in a week. I already read the first 4 books, and I plan to read them all over after they all come out."
5,One Day,"I just would like that say that I picked up this book at 2pm in the afternoon and everychance I got during the day I was reading it. It was such a wonderful and exciting story that I could not put it down until I was finished later that night. I truely recommend it to anyone who would like to read a great, easy read, funny, interesting, and overall awesome book."
4,"Ah, if only I was still young!",".This is a great book.But I'm too old to be reading it for the first time. If I had read it when I was younger I would've read it many, many times. But now, alas! I am too old to be reading it for the first time.When I finished reading it, I though, ""You know, if I had read this when I was a kid, then rereading it now would've been the greatest pleasure!""But oh well. I digged it anyway. And as they come out in paperback I'll buy and read them all. And then MY kids will have them, so they can give them the full five stars they arguably deserve.Oh--and all that Satanic stuff is ridiculous. Don't believe any noselin who says this book is Satanic. There's far more about Satan in Acts than there is in Harry Potter, book 1.That's enough on that."
5,This book was awsome!,"The Harry Potter series is the best series ever thought up in one persons mind.I couldnt stop readind it once I picked it up.I really didn`t like reading until this series came along.So far I have only read the first book but I hear ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""is sapose to be the best book J.K. Rowling has ever written.I am toward the end of Chamber of Secrets so I will be reviewing that soon."
5,A great way to bear tie ups in traffic !!,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""- audio - was a gift for a family member but since I am a Potter fan, I decided to listen to it on the way to work. A good way to relax when sitting on the Parkway!! Morning and Evening - really helps past the time."
3,Better than many but not the best,"There are many books of this type that are still among my favorites--The Hobbit, The Dark is Rising, A Wrinkle in Time, books by Rosemary Sutcliffe, etc. So I looked forward to adding a new favorite after reading some of the published reviews. I was disappointed. The book started well but became formulaic fairly early. There was little fresh or engaging about the characters; the whole thing felt ""forced cute."" Nowhere did I feel any chord of real emotional response--fear, awe, wonder--which characterises the other books I mentioned. I skimmed the last 75 pages or so just to reach closure on ""what happened."" If I had a child of the right age I would read this book to him/her, as it's better than average, but my guess is that very few young readers will find it is a book they come back to in later years."
4,A great book to read to your kids!,"Full of outrageous characters, silly twists, great romps, and imaginative craziness! My son, age 10, and I read this together. We BOTH found it a joy to read! On a side note, the book offers some social issues -- ""mean"" parents, bullies, going to a new school, learning what you're capable of doing -- that my son could identify with, which gave us a few things to talk about. Overall, a delightful book, and a great book to read with your kids!"
4,Great!,This first book in the series is perfect to get you hooked to read the rest of the series. My fifth grade class will be happy that I have read it.
4,UK Edition of HP,I loved that I could purchase the UK edition of HP through Amazon. In the item description it did not list that is was LARGE PRINT. I am not sure I would have purchased had I seen this in the info. I did receive notice that the book had shipped but didn't like the fact that no tracking # was provided.
5,A wonderful book full of wise knowledge for young and old,This book is wonderful. Don't let the reading age level stop you from sharing this book with a younger child. My 7 year old son and I would read several chapters nightly. We both loved the book and the time we spent together. There is wise knowledge in this book for both the young and old. We hated to end it. Now we can't wait to read the next one!!!!!
5,A very interesting novel about wizards and witches,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K, Rowing, is one of the best novels I have read in a really long time. This great book is mostly about wizards, how Harry Potter an eleven year old wizard had a lot of intresting adventures with his friends, making the reader not want to stop reading the book. In overall this is an excellent book to read and have in your personal library. I would like to recommend this magical book to everyone from a kid to an adult."
5,Great Book,"I got this book on friday,september 8. I started reading and couldn't put it down. I finished the book on sunday, september 10.This Book was great. It lead you into thinking it was one person when in fact it was another. After reading this book, I Promise You'll want to read the second!"
5,This book was great,That was a great book .Ya'll should try the book. Harry potter is a good book you should read it
5,"Great, fun read.","I really had a fun time reading this book. It may not be the world's greatest literature, but it sure was fun reading it. Give it a shot, you won't be sorry."
5,Just Amazing!,"The only reason I got this story in the first place, was because it came in a set with other books that I wanted in a book order at school. I simply put it in the back of my bookshelf when I got it in the mail and didn't look at it for several months. Then, on a snow day while school was closed I had nothing to do. I looked through my room and found Harry Potter. I read the first few chapters and became HOOKED! Just as I finished the first one I went out and bought the second. Two years later, I had read the third and second books at least two times. Something about leaving your troubles behind by going on a train far away and meeting new friends was a universal dream that most people have wished for. I've now seen the movie and waiting for the fifth novel of the series!"
5,Fantastic!,"Just Excellent!! The book is Great, J.K. Rowling is a wonderful writer and the perfomance of Jim Dale is Fantastic, each character is truly alive!"
5,Exciting and Thilling!,I am an elementary school teacher and my students just loved this book. We had a great time anticipating what Harry and his friends would do next. It is truly an adventurous read. It allowed the students to exercise their imagination and lose themselves in a fictional world of magic and mysticism as only could be seen through a child's eyes.
3,Great book,Recorded to reread the book on my be kindle. Things didn't change I couldn't put it down finished in 2 days!!! Love me some J.K Rowling!! <3
5,Omg.,Sooo amazing. NEED the next book. Loved every bit of the first book and I can't wait to get book two!
5,This book is the Bomb,Harry Potter series are the best books ever. I have read all three and they are amazing. You have got to read these books. J.K. Rowlings is a great writer and I hope she writes more Harry Potter books in the future. So my point is YOU HAVE TO READ THESE BOOKS!
2,Not the best,"I have read all three Harry Potter books and I do intend to keep reading the series but I'm not sure what all the hype is about. While these books are entertaining (and, as a teacher, of course I'm thrilled kids want to read these books or any others) J.K. Rowling is no C.S. Lewis, Susan Cooper, Lloyd Alexander, e. Nesbitt, Edgar Eager or Jane Langton -- all talented writers who have written fabulous books which take their readers to different worlds (all of them far more magical than Harry Potter's). The Harry Potter books are a good hook to get kids reading and interested but I would recommend any of the above-mentioned authors over Rowling. If you like the Harry Potter books, please don't just sit waiting for the Rowling publication. Instead, try these writers -- you won't be disappointed!"
3,FILER OVERUSE,"This could have been cut in half if Rowling removed the unnesesary parts. The Harry Potter Series just doesn't live up to the hypeNot bad, but only a small section is really interesting.A challenge to those who have yet to read it, start on page 100 and see if anything is confusing."
3,rising action for harry potter sorcerers stone,"Harry Potter is the only person who survived the curse of Voldemort, killing Voldemort as well, but leaving Harry with a thunderbolt scar on his forehead. after 11 years of torture from his aunt and uncle and his bratty cousin dudley, hogwarts sends for him to come to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. there he meets ron and hermione, his two first best friends, and Malfoy, his new rival. he also meets hagrid, who is the keeper of keys at hogwarts. throughout his first school year, he encounters a fight with a troll on halloween, quidditch games as the youngest seeker for gryffindor in a century, midterms and classes, horrible snape as his potions master, learning about the world his family was from, and trying to uncover the mystery of the sorcerer's stone, and why voldemort is after it."
2,Harry Potter,"I liked the Harry Potter books, and the writing, I'm glad to say, DOES get better as the series goes on. But seriously, these books are ntohing to go crazy over. They're your basic, Not origanal fantasy.The people, which I suppose JK Rowling tried to make realistic, are completely unbelievable. The Dursleys, Dumbledore, Snape, Harry Potter himself, the list goes on and on. The first book, like the fifth, is a big disappointment, and I don't see what the big deal is about these books in the first place. If you want good books, go to the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. Now those are books worth getting excited over."
5,Great read!,This is my third time reading this Harry Potter book and it's still a very exciting and very attention grabbing!
4,"gripping, funny, surprises to the very end","A very well written book by J K Rowling. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the tale of a young boy that grews up as a Human with his terrible aunt, uncle, and cousin. Soon, he is flying off to a school for witches and warlocks to start his schooling as a magical wizard. He faces great dangers to protect a stone that gives the owner everlasting life plus the power to turn metal into gold. He must fight the most wickedest of them all- the wizard who killed his parents."
3,Harry Potter,"Gr8 book:)Ron is my favorite character- I loved his sarcasim, Snape is nice sort of ?!?! That surprises me"
4,Great book,"Great book, very interesting. Lots of non stop entertainment. I would recommend this to many different readers of many different ages."
3,Why three stars?,"Though I am an avid book reader and Harry Potter fan I didn't think this book was that good. Let me explain,I think that when Rowling wrote this her writing style was just evolving. As the series continues her style gets stronger and stronger and you are pulled in to Harry's world."
1,Harry's spell didn't work for me,"I finally read this book, and what I found out was this book was one of the most overrated books I've ever read. The story was mediocre, I have no idea why most of the reviewers love this book. Furthermore, the main characters were dull. You find no one who is attractive, as you do when you're reading ""Gone with the wind"" by Margaret Michell. So I figured out this book must be for children. If I were 9, I might like this book. But I am 23, and I prefer books which are more profound. Try ""The Satanic Mill"" by Otfried Preussler. This masterpiece has got a ridiculous English title (the original title is 'Krabat'), but ""The Satanic Mill"" is the best fantasy I've ever read so far."
1,Harry Potter Sorcerers Stone,"I read this book in the 5th grade, because I thought it would be an interesting Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stonebook to read. After I had started the book I realized it was not interesting in fact it made me sick after the first two pages. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you like witchcraft books and other books like this. I would most likely give this book ONE star."
1,I didn't received this book just now.,"Hi,I did't received this item just now.I would like what is happening. I wish an help with the carrier.CelsoBrazil"
5,No book is better,"I am an ordinary girl and i used to love reading but after 4th grade i stopped liking reading because books weren't interesting to me anymore. everyone had been saying that harry potter books are really good, so i thought i would try one. well i bought this one and everyone who knew me and even i was shocked at how much time i was spending reading the book. it was so exciting i just couldn't stop. i have never read a book that was so incredible. now i am reading a lot again thanks to harry potter and the sorcerer's stone. i will never forget this book and if i do, i don't have a problem reading it again. now i just have to wait for the second book to arrive in the mail!"
2,Not exciting or thrilling,"After about 100 pages, this book seems like one of the dumbest books that you could have ever read or made up! There's this boy who gets a whole lot of letters (WOW, Creative!), and then they run off to an island or something where a giant guy meets y ou there. The rest of thebook isn't much better either. I thought it would be good because of all of these good reviews, but it was a huger dissapointment and a waste of money"
1,"Great book, but it did have one major flaw","This was a really really great book, except for one thing. Why did the wizards always have to make sure the muggles didn't know they existed? The only thing the book had to say on the subject was, that the muggles would always be asking them for things! That was a pretty lame excuse. However, I did think it was a very fun read, and, I am anxiously waiting the next book."
3,Dont read,I don't think that you should read this book because it isn't real and it makes kids do stupid things.If you should read this and your kid does something stupid than don't say that I didn't tell you so
2,so-so,"I have honestly seen better books. I love fantasy, but the old classics really reign supreme over today's stuff. Except for Brian Jacques' work. OK, shoot me. I mean, a kid who lives under the stairs,goes to a magic school at age 11 and has some adventures. Whatever."
2,Average Fantasy Novel,"Despite all of the hype about Harry Potter, I found myself getting tired of such an easy, boring read. After being told that this was the greatest book of all time, I was surprised at the interest level in the content of the story. Harry Potter is an unimpressive, childish read. Recommended to ages (3-10)"
1,yes i am those crazy people who hate harry potter,i bought this book because everyone finished the entire series and all liked it. seriously i dont like this book. no originality at all
2,GIRLS DON'T RELATE TO HARRY POTTER!!!!!,"I know a lot of people LOVE Harry Potter books and I have to admit, I used to enjoy the magical and suspenseful feeling I used to get when I turned the pages but as a teenager I now realize that it is much better for young girls to be reading books that will keep our feet on the ground. Judy Blume books are my favorite because the books take you through life as a teenager and it is easier to rlate to a self-concious teenager than a genius wizard who likes to ride a broom and defeat evil wizards for fun. As girls, we have to find a book to relate to that will help us through life and Harry Potter is deffinetly NOT one of them."
5,Great Book,I am 19 and have just read the book. I feel that it is a great book and I am afraid that it is going to be banned. I would like to allow my children to experiance this book and will be purchasing it as soon as possable. It helps to let kids use thier imagination of what it would be like to come from a differnt walk of life.
4,I Read it after the movie,"After seeing the movie I could not wait to read the book. I've always found that books are by far more detailed and wonderful then the movies. In the case of The Sorcerer's Stone I'm not so sure that this was the case. Maybe because they did such an excellent job in relaying the story and keeping it real in the movie.I enjoyed the book a great deal, however, Rowling seemed to move through details awefully quickly. A few examples are the chess game and the Troll getting into Hogwarts. The movie helped to create suspense and I just did not get that from her book.The sorcerer's stone is a quick read and while it is meant for children, adults will enjoy it as well. It's Alice in Wonderland meets Annie meets...well I don't know what else to compare it to. Rowling has an excellent imagination and it's no wonder that her books have reached historical sales!"
1,Heyy,Heyy what are you looking at my sweet was my favorite line in the book and yes it was in the book you just have to read between the lines
1,Why do people like this book?,"I am 14, I love reading, and this is probably the most boring, unoriginal and derivative story I have ever read. It is not interesting and was a waste of my time. Can someone please respond to my review and tell me why people like these books?"
1,I just didn't like this book.,"Call me crazy, but I just didn't like this book. I thought itmoved rather slowly. The book just plays on that hackneyed boy-wizardmagical theme that's been done time and time again. Childrens' books that have some kind of underlying portent are the best kinds of childrens' books, and Harry Potter just doesn't fit that mold."
3,Harry Potter; It's Really Not That Great!,"Though Harry Potter is one of the most sucessful series in the world, if you take a closer look at this book, you would realizes that it's not really that great. J. K. Rowling writes as if she was an angst-ridden junior high student; the sentences are descriptive, but in a childish way, (she basically throws a bunch of adjectives on a noun about a million times in a row) she is horribly repetitive, (I think I read ""Harry jumped"" about twenty times) the characters are just so... so flat, and worst of all is the horribly predictable ending.I'm not sayying this is a bad book, but it's just not a good one...Trust me, and don't believe the hype. If you really want to read it, get from your library, it's not good or original enough to waste any money on."
1,One of the Worst Book Ever,"This is the most boring books I have ever read! Maybe the last 2 chapters have a little, key word ""little"" action in them. I hardly wanted to pick up the book. I think a long stuided story. The Series dosen't get good till the Goblet of Fire. The new on comeing out is going to be so long its just dumb to read. Even the moves were having a hard time making the story exiting. I am not even going to borther with the new one. Just by hearing the title ""Order of the Phoenix"" sounds boring. How his there going to be 7 of them!? Harry Potter fans are in for it now."
1,a slow moving book,"I guess I am the odd one out. I read this book to see if it was safe to give my young daughter to read, and I found it to be very boring. So many pages, for not much information. It reminded me of a preteen's writing style. Safe to give my daughter? yes,but it's not her style either."
1,Harry Potter should just disappear,"Hype is like a Tsunami, it's a massive relentless wave that swallows everyone whole. I tried reading the first book and couldn't get through it; the writing is so bad, so unoriginal. I didn't care about any of the charecters. How is it that these books are so popular? Even the movies are slow and were it not for the special effects there would be nothing to look at. And the house names: Slitheren? I'm glad J.K. Rowling is out of poverty, good for her. Now she should try, I mean REALLY TRY to write something exciting. Something that leaves the reader breathless, something that doesn't make me want to wave a magic wand and make the whole series vanish."
5,Great book,After seeing the movie the book gave a greater insight deeper into the story line. Loved the book and will continue to read the whole series.
5,Captivating!,"I liked this book very much!! The author has a way of making the words come alive!(not unlike a sorceress)! It's nice to see how Harry comes to terms with being a great sorcerer and his being famous. I can't wait for the sequel, I hope Dudley gets it good!!hahaha!"
4,refreshing,"I would say I'm a muggle and the the story is very mugglish, in the sense that is pretty ordinary escapism. Exactly what one needs after an abysmal day at work. The prose is crystal clear and the story is devoid of complicated plot intricacies. The rare twists are rather twist-friendly and I understand the need for linearity (kids and all). I loved the book. I recommend Jonathan Carroll if you can find it and you'll know what I mean."
4,Great for kids and adults...but low on detail,"I loved the book, but surprisingly I loved the movie even more! The book was suited more for teenagers and down, in my opinion, but the movie was full of details not fully ""shown"" in the book. I am more of a Tolkien-style lover myself: UNBELIEVABLE detail and place settings...so that might have set me off on the wrong path when starting this book.The fact that the movie was better than the book might be contributed more to great directors, acters, and the like, but who knows?I highly recommend reading the book and then watching it play out on screen!"
5,Children's Literature An Adult Would Be Proud To Read,"The first Harry Potter book, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", is a classic example of fiction writing at it's best: we care for the characters, laugh and cry and gasp in all the right places...but most importantly, for this writer, the book has something happening on nearly every page, ends chapters with a cliffhanger, and builds a sensible and reasonable climax (even with an unexpected surprise that totally sets us up throughout the book) that make it the classic example of fine writing that it is -- no matter what your age."
4,The First,"For anyone who wants to escape the troubles of our real world, and find a world of creativity, magic, and heroes, this is the book for you. Children will be lost in these books, and it will make them want to read. Adults will become Children again.Harry Potter has lived in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years when he is rescued by a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid. The magic is everywhere, from the train, to objects, even to classes. He soon has two best friends, and with them he becomes a detective and solves his first mystery as a wizard.This book will appeal to people of all ages and teaches many values such as friendship and bravery. You will enjoy this book if you read it."
5,This is the best book I've ever read,"I picked up this book because it was 1-2-3 on the bestseller list. I thought it was probably a fad. I was terribly wrong! It had enormous depth and you were really pulling for the charecters. The ending was like the rest of the book, Superb! I would reccomend this book to a child who wants to start reading or an adult who wants a free reading book."
5,What a great book!,"I fell in love with this book almost from the beginning. I felt as though I was taken back to a time when my imagination was set on auto-pilot and my magical powers, although not fully revealed to me, were much greater then the abilities of my closest friends. J.K. Rowling wrote the greatest bedtime story that I have ever heard and created a world that is almost as well defined as Star Wars.In each page I lived the moments with Harry, Ron, and Hermione (whose exact name pronunciation I did not learn until Book 4 - Its Her-mee-oh-nee, for those who haven't gotten that far yet). Although the adventure has the ability to get old quickly, Ms. Rowling has injected enough reality to keep the story interesting. The characters remain close to life so that young and old can still identify with their triumphs and pitfalls.If Rowling keeps putting them out, I will keep buying them. 5 stars just isn't enough ******!"
5,This book is a fantastic fast-paced fantasy.,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a fantastic book.10 year old Harry Potter discoveres he's a wizard, makes cool new friends and defeats other evil wizards in this fast-paced fantasy. This is a book most imaginative kids should love."
5,Harry Potter and The Sorceres Stone,"This was the best book I ever read. Well it is one of the best. Harry Potters parenys die when he is only an infant ( baby ). I am one of the biggest Hermine fan in the hole world. I love the strong efection for me read this. There is a lote of adventure in this book, I recamend this book for the people who love fantasy, adventure, and wizards. I give thanks to my 4th grade teacher fir sharing it to my class."
5,It was great I can't wait until the sequel comes out!,I read it in about two hours in the sun. It was so good I couldn't put it down. I even read during breakfeast and lunch. Can anyone tell me the title of the first one I'd like to read it.
3,Good Ideas,"But you have to admit, the stories go all over the place! You might call it creativity but I see it as compacting 'whatever you can think of' ideas into one draggingly long book.But I do give points for stirring up such a fuss all over the world. Must have created whole new markets out there."
5,A magical journey to a place of childhood dreams.,"You're a kid. You wish you wish you could have magical powers. You wish something exciting would happen in your life. You wish you could stand up to some toughs at school. You wish you could fly. With Harry Potter, you get to see a kid do all these things. You learn how magic isn't all it seems to be. A wonderful tale of friendship and fun and mystery, it unfolds before your eyes like a, well, magic carpet. Good for boys and girls. I bet Robin Williams will be cast as Hagrid, the school groundskeeper, in the movie."
5,Potter will keep you on the edge of your seat,"This is a book that you won't be able to put down. It is the best book i ever read. It is a book about a boy named Harry Potter who finds out he is a wizard. Then, he gos to Hogworth's School of Wizardry and Whitchcraft. There he meets Ron and Hermoine and become friends and together save the Sorcer's Stone from getting in the hands of the evil Voldermort."
5,Harry potter sweeps the country,This is one of the best books i've ever read; and i'm not alone in saying this. more and more people are becoming intranced by J.K Rowlings unique and fast paced writing style. Definitly a book to add to your collection
5,I was very surprised at how good it was.,"Being a reader who has read many books, I thought that I was too mature to read these books and won't find them interesting. But when my little brother got one I took a look at the first chapter and started to read it. From that moment on I was hooked, the time I usually spent watching television was now being spent reading this book. I was so into it only took me 2 days to finsih it. This is a great book and a superior series. Any one of any age who loves to read should get this book."
4,This book was an amazing work of art.,"HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCEROR'S STONE was a really great book.The author made it all seem very real, and it was almost amazing how Rowling made the whole fantasy world in such detail."
5,A fabulous trip to your imagination...,"This is one of the most uniquely written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. JK Rowling is wonderfully creative, not only with the overall plot, but with each individual chapter. There were some great scenes that I absolutely loved in this book...however, i don't want to give the book away...so I will not mention specifics. All i can say is that this is one of the best books you will ever read! I still haven't figured out how it is possible to dislike this story. READ IT! LOVE IT!BUY THE SEQUELS!"
3,The story of an ordinary boy who finds out he is a wizard.,"This book is competantly written and compares well with most children's books written today. BUT for plot, interesting magical events, character development, and interesting dialog it cannot compare with E. Nesbit's, Edward Eager's nor with C.S. Lewis's books! (for example: The Enchanted Castle by E. Nesbit, Half Magic by Edward Eager, and the Narnia Series by Lewis.)"
5,A perfect bedside compainion...,"J. K. Rowling's outstanding novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Her increadable style and miraculasly realistic charecter development, along with an awsome and spellbinding plot stirred together in a Magic Cauldron create one heck of a spell: Harry Potter. Harry will undoubtably be a classic along with the Winnie The Pooh stories and The Hobbit."
5,A MUST READ!!!!!,"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great book! A must read! Once you start, you will NEVER put it down. It is a classic. If you haven't read the Harry Potter books, you haven't read anything yet!! A masterpiece!!!!!"
5,This book was da bomb!,I can't believe how good this book was! It was great how Rowling can capture my imagination.
4,Harry potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,I like Harry Potter because they are Exciting and full of adventure. You always want to read more no matter where you are or what time it is.
5,PERFECT!!!!!,"OMG! I have read this book 9 times(literally) and evrytime I jumped, laughed, and gasped in surprise evrytime! I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan and as soon as I read this book was when I relised how trully magical the world of Harry Potter is! I recomend this book to anyone - adults, children, anyone... Every word, paragraph and page is written with such care and security you wonder how that brilliant J.K. Rowling even imagined this! Quidditch is the best spot ever. Harry, Hermione and Ron show truly what best-friends are. This book is just...PERFECT!!"
4,What's all the fuss?,"This is without a doubt a truly charming book (no pun intended), and sure to be a classic. However, I'm still not quite sure what all the fuss is about...there are many exemplary children's books that don't generate anything like the excitement that this series has... I simply wonder why."
5,"a delightful, rare book that lives up to the hype","I admit it: I was prepared to strongly dislike Harry Potter--what with all the hype, the droves of fans, the bestseller-dom and the geeky genre of fantasy (yes, I'm a bit of a crumudgeon). But this book absloultely delighted me, kept me glued to the pages, laughing and snorting aloud at times. Rowling does a marvellously economical job of creating engrossing characters and an alternate world that makes perfect sense on its own terms. If Harry Potter can enchant me, (a 39-year old single male with intellectual pretentions and an aversion to the over-hyped and the mainstream) I can't imagine who would be immune. I immediately picked up the second book (which held my attention, but didn't seem quite as good) and am now halfway through ""Prisoner"" (which so far seems every bit as good as ""Chamber""). And now I'm off to Scotland to see if J. K. Rowling will marry me..."
5,A MUST READ!!!!!!!,"I've never read a book as great as this one! J.K. Rowling did a spectacular job. I was just about to read the second Harry Potter book, when I realized, needed to read the first book. Am I glad I did! It would be hard to read the second book without reading the first book because you have to get to know all the characters and vocabulary."
5,The first in the series,This book establishes the basis for Harry Potter and is excellent. I ordered this book simply to complete the set in hardcover for my daughter.
4,"Without the hype, what might this be?","I picked up Harry Potter because I wanted to see what the big deal was about. I only wish I could know what I'd think of this without everybody screaming that it's fantastic. I think I would have liked it pretty well, but I wouldn't wait up all night for the next one in the series (well, maybe...). It can be compared to stuff like A Wrinkle in Time, only much more lighthearted and the characters do seem slightly more real. Harry and his friends could be any fourth/fifth grader (except maybe Hermione) and the way he deals with his problems isn't anything out of whack. What makes these stories so fun is Rowling's sense of humor and oddity. But is it all fun and games? Well, the first one is, generally, but don't get to hooked on this series if you're not willing to put up with the Dark Arts..."
5,Perfect book to get kids started reading!,"There's just one way to put it. The book is terrific. First chapter is a little hard to get going in. It's hard to understand what's going on, - but as soon as the 2nd chapter gets going - so does the book. I loved it! Got my daughter back to books. She would suddenly not read - now she does! Good for both child and adult. Read it!"
5,I'm Mezmerized!,Harry Potter is a very lovable character who leads the reader through many magical adventures. Listening by audio allowed me to close my eyes and let my imagination soare through the corridors of HogWarts. After finishing the story I absoluetely can not wait to see what adventures are ahead in Part II.
5,This book is on the top of my list! Kids & adults love it!!,"Harry is an 10 year old orphan, living with his extremely mean and spoiled cousin and his parents. They have made him believe Harry's parents were killed in a car crash. Near his 11th birthday, Harry begins to receive mysterious letters. The aunt and uncle know what they really are and destroy every one he gets. Finally, after a struggle, Harry gets to read a letter brought by a strange visitor. This letter is explaining that he is a wizard and they are inviting him to Hogwarts, the best school of wizardry and magic in the world. Harry soon enters a magical world full of every-flavor candy, broomsticks, magic wands and more."
2,what's the big deal?,"From the review this book got, you would think it was the first children's fantasy book ever written. Sure, the author of the Harry Potter books has some inventive additions to the typical fantasy story (Quidditch is one of my favorites, and has enjoyable, if somewhat stereotypical, characters and plots. Nothing, however, that justifies the reviews that this book has been getting. And as for appealing to adults, I can think of several children's fantasy books that would be equally, if not more, appreciated by more mature readers. In summary, read the book, call it excellent and original if you must, but please stop treating it like the best thing that ever happened to children's literature."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I read a little bit of this book.However,I did not read all thechapter .Mr and Mrs Dursley.Mrs Dursley were the sister of Mrs potter but they hadn't met for several years.In fact,Mrs Dursley pretended she didn't a sister,because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was another good reason for keeping the potters away ,they didn't want dudley mixing with a child like that.The child were with Mr and Mrs Dursley and named him harry potter.This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter and the sorcere's stone.Harry is a nobody,treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begradgingly interited him whan his parents were killed by the evil voldernort.Mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite,yes,altogether different from his aunt,uncle and spoiled,piglike cousin Dudley.this is the little bit I read."
5,10 yr. old fan's review of Harry Potter's world of warlocks,"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is a magnificent must read. It is an exquisite, intriguing story of wizardry. Harry makes the story funny because of his dry, sarcastic humor. Any 21st century kid could relate to the daily life Harry goes through, including the bullies at Hogworts, trouble with his parents (aunt and uncle), and his maturation at the end of the novel. The book is realistic because the characters act as normal people would, under the circumstances. It's a ""can't-put-down-please-read-more"" adventure story. I highly recommend this book."
4,Great,Little do you know when you start this book that you are embarking on one of the greatest stories of your life. A perfect start to a perfect series that will ALWAYS have my heart
5,BIG T's reveiw,I think this book is very good. Harry Potter books are for all ages. To me Harry Potter books drive youre amaganation As for as you can think. Harry Potter books always have you on the edge of your imagenation and they always have you thinking whats going to happen next. Every time I tried to put this book down I hade to pick it up and see what was going to happen next. To me Harry Potter books are the best books out and will always be the best books out. I think that J.K. Rowling will keep the sequels going if she wants to keep on macking alot of money. I think Harry Potter Is the best F**king book ever.
5,Great book for all ages!,"This book is about a boy who has magic parents who die. When he was a baby he was left on the door step of his very mean aunt and uncle. After being treated bad for 10 long years he finally finds out on his 11th birthday that he's a wizerd,and is going to Hogwarts school Witchcraft and wizardre. Then a guy from the school helps him out along the way. He also finds to friends who helps him out intil summer."
2,Good,"the book is good, but it spends a lot of time in the introduction. Maybe is because its the first. However, is good."
3,The beginning of a literary empire,"A thoroughly enjoyable read. Had I been 10 - 12 years old when I read it (it was instead Jules Vernes who captured my imagination at that age) I probably would have declared this to be the best book ever written and proceeded to become as hooked on the sequels and movies as the youth (and many not so young) of today. But when all is said and done, J.K. Rowling did not reinvent the literary wheel with this series in spite of the enormous amount of sales and acclaim that resulted from it. She simply wrote some pretty good YA fantasy books. This is the only one I read or felt inclined to read, but presumably the details grew richer and more addicting to fans as the series went on."
5,The no Sleep Book,"This book is the best book I have ever read. This unfortunetly doesn't say much by the fact I don't read a lot, but this is the only book that kept me up until 12 at night to read. It is also the only book that got me in troble for reading it in the middle of class,and I am typing in a sort of daze because I was up all night reading the second one witch is just as good as the first. So if you are one of those people that think the world would be alot more fun riding on a broom stick (and who does't) than this is a book for you or if you have a kid that just won't read than through him or her this book and tell them to read the first few chapters thay will be asking for the second one in a week. This is a good book to read to your kids that can't read yet but I warn you some parts might make king cong afrad of the dark so the sugested ages are 1-101."
5,Fun read!,I an late reading this series but finally decided to. The book was a lot of fun and i look forward to the rest!
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITEN!!!!!!!,"When my teacher started reading it, I started paying more attention then mostly do.There was so many surprises around every turn.I could not belive that a book could be so great!"
5,The Beginning of an Increadible Journey,"I'm 20 years old and I fell in love with a childrens novel. I wouldn't have guessed that in my life. The book that targets young children, had my mom, dad, sister, and myself reading til the early dawn. Once you pick up ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" you will struggle to put the book down. A young child Harry Potter brings us to the magical world of spells and snakes. One reading the book becomes engulfed in the fancy new language and concepts brought on by J. K. Rowling. After reading the books, I felt a part of the young child and his magical friends lives. It was so easy to become engulfed with a child who is an outcast in a society we live in yet famous in a world that seems as real as anything else, but truely a figment of the readers imagination. It's a great gift for a young loved one, but don't be suprised when you pick up the book and read it all in a day or two. You will probably end up buying the rest of the books too."
5,An absolutely enchanting book for anyone to enjoy!,"Although I adore Chekhov, Tolstoy, Dante, Steinbeck...(I really love to read and have rather eclectic tastes)nothing compares to a well-written, unique, children's book. This book is the epitome of stories for the young that can satisfy readers of any age. Harry Potter and his troupe of young wizards (and witches) to be has charmed me! I'm on my second (maybe fourth) run through both Harry Potter books, and am enjoying them just as much as the first time through...."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"Finally! A book that parents and children can truly enjoy together! Harry Potter is a true hero. He's brave, positive, and a good friend to the end, yet vulnerable at the same time. Wonderful for family reading time! Mind expanding fun!"
1,ANNOYING,"Too bad the lowest rating was 1!! Who wants to read about some magical boy with wounderous adventures and mysteries and such and all that junk! There are plenty of books just as good as this but don't get 1/35173th of the creditJust in case readers think otherwise, I HAVE read the book!!"
1,HARRY POTTER,"I like Harry Potter because Ilike how they are written, I think they are inneresting and exciting"
1,Copyright infringment????,"This item was very unprofessional and I question it's legality. The disc was a ""Walmart"" disc and label, there were no copyrights to the disc. It looked as though someone had purchased the ""legal"" copy, burned it on a computer and is selling them ILLEGALLY online. I tried to contact AMAZON but they are non responsive-!!"
1,I'd be happier if it had arrived,This book has not arrived. I have written to the seller two times and to Amazon two days ago. I have not heard from either. Doesn't make me a happy consumer.
1,Where is my purchase?,My item was supposed to be delivered to my dorm room between April 22 and May 7 it is now May 16 and I am no longer at my dorm because class has ended and I have not received my purchase. I would give this purchase no stars if that was an option because in order to have a review of a purchase it implies receiving it. I wrote them and email and never got a reply back.
1,Ignore my review,"Please pay close attention to my title. I am mainly writing this for two reasons. One I do not want Amazon to recommend these books or any like them to me. Two I genuinely dislike these books. The premise is tired and unoriginal. This writer has creatively blended all of the greatest mythology stories and essentially given it a 20th century make over. With the exception of Quiddich. By and large I think these books were written for people who don't want to be challenged anymore and simply want to mentally check out while reading instead of watching TV. So, once again go along with your blissfully ignorant lives of what a real author would create and ignore this review."
5,A Must Have,"I have an 8 yr. old daughter and a 6 yr. old son. My 8 yr. oldhates to read, it's a constant fight. I bought Harry Potter with thehopes of stirring her even a little. Harry and his unique line of friends and foes did just that. Every night they passed up T.V. time, computer time, even ice cream to hear the next chapter in the exciting mystical world of Harry Potter. I can't wait for books 2, 3, and 4!"
4,Where about Diana Wynne Jones?,"There's no doubt that this first Harry Potter novel isdelightful reading, but have readers noted its worrying similarity toDiana Wynne Jones' novels? Harry Potter seems to be distilled from two Jones novels: Archer's Goon, in which a middle-class English boy learns he is the youngest of a family of squabbling gods, and Eight Days of Luke, in which a boy being raised by horrid relatives who dote on their own fat, cruel son and treat the hero like a male Cinderella wins his freedom with the help of the Norse god Loki.What's worrying is that if you mixed these two Jones novel together, you'd get...Harry Potter. Have other readers noticed this?"
2,it's ok........,"I am not a big fan. As you see, I bought the book a week ago b/c and only b/c it's on sale and I would like to get sth to read. The story is a little bit disapointed. Why there are always evil aunt and uncle??? Why the little victim is always the ""super special boy""? It's a okay book for little kids to have fantasy about magic, spells, etc. But the depth ideas are not as heathly as the surface - a little special boy learnt magic. When you read the book to your kids, please pay attention to the negative ideas regarding the aunt and uncle issue."
2,Rather boring with less than original plot,"I found this book kinda boring and not that original. It's not that I don't like fantasies, but this book is just a cute children's book. It's storyline repeats itself and stuff doesn't really come as a shock. It can't stir emotions and the characters don't develop. They just keep getting in trouble. I know a lot of books that have better plots that make magic seem fun and amazing. This book muddles it and makes it confusing. If you want a good fantasy book I suggest the Lord of the Rings series and The Golden Compass.I am not a person who hates books I just find this one dull and unoriginal. Same line, Same verse, A little more popular, and a whole lot worse!"
5,Great book!,"I read the entire series over a couple of weeks. Rowling is exceptionally talented and keeps the reader coming back for more. I'm currently re-reading the series and enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first. Just read it! Could say more, but I'd rather you find out for yourself."
1,boring book,that book is the most boring i have ever read in my life.i regret that i read it and i suggest everybody not reading it.reading that book is absolutely waste of time !!!(...)
1,"i just didn't like this book ,December 13,2001","Call me crazy,but I just didn't like this book.I thought it moved rather slowly. The book just plays on that hackneyed boy-wizardmagical theme that's been done time again. Chilren's books that have some kind of underlying protent are the best kinds of childrens' books, and Harry Potter just doesn't fit that mold."
1,Hedwig's role is the best,"I don't know what to rate this book. It's not the best, and the best character, i believe, is actually HEDWIG!!!! I really do love hedwig, and i'm glad that JK Rowling made her up because the book would be NOTHING. They use the word ""muggle"" in a lot of books, and i'm not sure if it's her stealing OTHER people's ideas, or if it's other people stealing HER ideas. Anyway, i resent this book except for the parts with hedwig because a mail-carrying owl is so much more magical than the beginning of the book, even though the beginning IS magical. (I was even hedwig for halloween)!Well, I just saved you. I despise this book, and i only recommend it if you enjoy leafing through the book and finding lovely parts about hedwig. I still think HEDWIG is the best character, and all the humans are just...mostly fake. The movies have done a good job transforming this book into something that everyone is crazy about.(Hedwig fanatic, signing off!!!)"
5,A Great Book: I wish they had this when I was 12!,"I absolutly love this book. Whe I babysit for some kids who have this, I read this when they're in bed instead of watching TV. It's great! Read it!"
5,Great for Kids and Adults,"Harry Potter is an absolutely wonderful character! I started reading the book with my 7 year old son and quickly found that both he and I were addicted! We managed to finish the Sorcerer's Stone in 1 week reading it after dinner up until bedtime. We actually found that time flew and it was almost impossible to put the book down. We found ourselves feeling sorry for Harry, feeling excited when he met Hagrid and quite anxious when he was faced with the two faced man.J.K. Rowling is an astonishing writer and my hat goes off to her for writing books that can once again bring a family back together. She makes me feel like I am missing something by being a Muggle!"
5,A Modern Classic For All Ages. Highly Recommended!,".********************************************************I wish I read these books as a child. Even though I'm not a child, I still enjoyed reading this book to my niece and plan on buying the complete series.Harry Potter is an orphan who survived an attack by the strongest wizard of his time. This wizard, who killed his family, could not kill Harry. The forces of good rejoiced, but fearing to spoil him, left him to be raised by his mean aunt and uncle.It is not hard to imagine that Harry is, or will become, himself a wizard. He seems destined to meet and beat this bad guy some day.These are the sorts of books that will be handed down from generation to generation. Start a new family tradtion. Buy this book for your children and for yourself and for your grandchildren.... Senior********************************************************"
5,Wonderful !!,"I thought this was a wonderful book! It wax thrilling and only took me two days to read. I would however like to make a comment. Saying that anyone above fourth grade is too old to enjoy this book,that just makes me mad! I am an 8th grader. I also dont belive that all the book is about is Witchcraft and Wizardry and saying that humans are stupid. Look at Hermione Granger, she's muggle born and they dont talk about her badly."
3,"Pretty good, but not a classic.","Although I liked this book, it does have a number of flaws that keep me from rating it as highly as others have.Since the Amazon reviews gives a rather complete plot description, I won't add any more to it. For the most part, it is a pretty typical ""school of magicians"" book. The characters are engaging, and three-dimensional.However, I feel that Rowling ""cheats"" too many times. For instance, a number of times she has major characters act in rather uncharacteristic ways in order to move the plot. This is rather disturbing -- especially on the second reading where the reader knows that the reason for the sudden personality change is that the author is being lazy.Also, there is a logic puzzle given in the text, which one of the characters, Hermione, solves. Unfortunately, only PART of the puzzle is shown to the reader -- Hermione knows more than the reader. This is quite unpleasant, since it keeps the readers from solving it themselves. Disappointing."
4,Great read!,I enjoyed this book. Not what I expected from a young readers author. Will definitely read the series. Can't wait!
5,The best EVER written!,"I think this book is the best EVER written. Some other people may not think so, but it caches my imagination TOTALLY, and I REALLY hope there's a long series added on it! I suggest that every kid with lots of imagination should read it. And kids without a lot of imagination should read it also! it's da bomb!"
5,A Muggles Perspective,"A fun, magical, beginning to a legendary story that will capture the imagination of muggles, young and old, for generations to come."
1,Poor Product and Service,"The product was in horrible condition. I bought it to replace an older version for a neighbor who let me borrow it and the ""new"" one I bought was in worse condition than one I wanted to replace. The product arrived within the time frame promised, but came later than any thing else I have bought from amazon. I was very disappointed when I received my merchandise. Don't buy from this person, they are not honest about what they sell."
1,this book is missery,"My mom got me this book thinking I would like it. I HATED THIS BOOK. This makes no since. My grandma was reading it to me. She Hated It. I Hate It. we made it to chater 5, all I remember is Harry was wearing glasses. and just how bored it was. To yall that love it I don't understand a bit of it. I despise this book. I give the aurthor and the folks that worked on it credit. We only made it to chapter 5. (...) I cant do the other review. God Bless"
1,What was I thinking?!!!,"I picked up this book recently because of all the hype and critical acclaim. I love fantasy(JRR Tolkien, George RR Martin, Robert Jordan etc.) and thought this would be a good book to add to my list. Well folks, let me tell you, this is not only one of the worst fantasy books I have ever read, it is one of the worst books I have ever read. This JK Rowling is a disgrace to fantasy readers and writers everywhere. If you have any hint of self-respect what-so-ever, my advice to you is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!"
1,why doing a mistake ?,"This book is a great way to waste your free time .The story is so flat that you think to your self thatit is too long for a bad joke .Don't buy it , it is a waste of money !"
4,A strong beginning,"Since I have the privilege of having read the next 3 books before writing this, I can say that this is not the best of the 4. It is, however, a wonderful beginning to an enchanting story of such a magical world. Rowling does an excellent job of defining her characters and giving tantalizing insights into the world of HP. These elements alone make it an enjoyable story; a classic rainy afternoon read."
5,A Great Start to a Great Series,"You know, I can tell why so many Christians and religious groups hate these books... No really... it's very evil, what with the children having fun, and learning the value of friendship. The main character is especially demonic. Harry has some audacity to willingly leave a home and situation where he is regularly starved, confined, and beaten for a place where he finds friends, love, family, and a past he never knew he had. Seriously, it just reeks of Satan.Honestly, the Harry Potter books are wonderful entertainment for children and adults. I found myself shutting off my inner-cynic while reading, and being carried into a world that is as well-realized as it is fun. Rowling's style is funny, witty, and emotionally moving. I can't wait for book 5, guess I just have to read the first four again. And mark Novemember 15 on your calendars... the Second Movie."
5,The Harry Potter Original Is Great,"The first book is such a good book. Although I haven't read the other books, this one is a very good novel. The book has a lot of twists, and although these twists move along very quickly, the story stays interesting throughout the whole story, and that matters the most. A terrific book that can be read by children and adults alike. Highly recommended."
5,A wonderful book!,"I must say, when everyone else first picked up this book a few years ago, I gawked at it. I thought it couldn't be as wonderful as people said, I mean it was a children's book.When I finally did pick up this book, I literally could have used it as a fan! I loved this book, and the characters were extremelly engrossing! Harry, Hermoine, and Ron, they all had very seperate personalities. As soon as I finished this book, I immedently started the second and then the third and finally the fourth. They all are completly wonderful, and mus be read in sequence to make sense.In a world where childrens' books are often too childish for adults and teens, and adult books are snubbed by teens and completely not understandable by most children, Harry Potter is a rare find! I wonder who these books were written for, becouse we all love them!Buy it, you'll love it, I promise you!"
5,Harry potter,"I am not an avid reader, but I can't put any of the Harry Potter books down. Great read for anyone."
4,It Got Me!,"I was skeptical at first. Tried to resist the pressure I was feeling from people around me who had read the book. I didn't want to read it, I thought, like many times, people are just exaggerating it because it's a best seller. And plus, it IS a children's book why would I read it?Well, I am sorry that I waited so long now. I finished the book in one day! From the first chapter, the book got to me so much I couldn't put it down until I finished it. It is a children's fantasy book, but it's also definitely more. I think it's a great way to teach children and (even the big children like us) not to judge a book by its cover.I will not spoil it more for those of you who have still not read it. If you are one of those people, PLEASE read it! It's a story I would definitely read as a bad time story to children."
3,My thoughts,"My review about the book Harry Potter is that is a very interesting book. It has a little bit of everything. For examplethe book had Plot,Theme,Setting,and Conflict.At the begining of the book it was really borring but in the end the book gets really good.Because it has more actions.I would recomend this book to other people.But the only thing I didn't like about it was some parts were kind of complicated.So I wouldn't recomend this book to younger kids.I kind of liked the book at the end of the chapte.If I was to give this book a ratting i would give it 3 stars."
5,The sorcerers stone,This is a 5 star book. Well written and wonderful story. I am sure I will read it again and again.
4,Loved it - and had no idea it was a book for kids,"Just a quick review to say that I had no idea this was considered a children's book until I looked up info on other books by Rowling. Looking back on it, it certainly wasn't difficult to read, but it was a great story and with wonderful characters. Can't wait until my daughter is old enough to read it (but I'll have to buy another copy because I just shipped mine to my sister in Germany)."
4,JK Rowlings is Masterpiece,"This book is perhaps one of the best I've ever read. It's not to long not to short and a definite promise of a sequel. The plot, which I'm sure many people know all to well is that, an underdog (in this case an abused child raised by his wretched aunt and uncle) becomes a wizard whom his aunt and uncle fear. Now when I first read this book it wasn't because the movie was coming out I just did because my Dad made me. Now I hated the movie but this book I praise and recommend as a good read. The many characters are so petty and human and somehow in hundreds of countries no matter what language it's in Harry Potter has cast a spell that has made him one of the most well known characters in the world."
4,awesome,This book was great because it gave kids a good perspective of magic. I think it went a little over board though on how much magic it used. But I mean if you are really into this stuff this book is for you
3,Harry potter and the sorcerers stone,This book was I'm not really a Harry potter fan though I would give it a three at the most
5,Harry potter,Very fun and catchy love itCool awesome my favorite series in the world hermione is my favorite character the end
4,Good Book.,I bought the first Harry Potter Book a few weeks ago. The first two chapters of the book were Sort of boring... But then when you get to the 3rd chapter it starts getting really good! I enjoyed the book. It's not just for kids!!!!
5,Loads of fun.,This book is cleverly written and enloyable to read. I especially enjoyed how creative this make-believe world is that Rowling has created.
2,I must be the only person in the world...,"I must be the only person in the world to not love this book. But I didn't. I thought it began well - with the horrible adoptive parents and their child - but then I felt the book was sooo predictable. And when it wasn't predictable, it was because a new deus ex machine was introduced into the story. The writing is pedestrian for the most part. I did like the quiddich matches, but I really don't understand the big fuss about this book. To me, it reads like a Walt Disney animated cartoon."
2,My Harry Potter Book Review thank you by gaby,This book didn't give me the right feeling that i like in a book. I like funnier and shorter books with easier words. I don't like magical and fancy books with uncorns and magic carpets and evil monsters because that is kind of wierd to me because its not realistic like other things are.It was okay in some parts because you could actually understand what things are. Maybe other people could understand what they were saying but maybe i'm just stupid. i don't know but i think that there are better books out there that are waiting for other people to read them.
4,Good reading,A good start to a great series. Truly an enjoyable page turner for all ages. I don't think I'll ever get tired of rereading it.
5,The review of Harry Potter Book 1,There is no way possible that I could give this book anything less than five stars! I hope someday somebody will be able to write a a book series close to the amount of awesomeness this book has!
4,Harry potter sorcerers stone rating,"I chose this rating for the book because it was one of the most amazing, interesting, challenging and magical I loved it!!!!"
2,What's the big deal???????,"I have read all but the fourth Harry potter book. All my friends think these books are great. WHY?????? I have no religious problems with these books, but I find it pretty sad how much of the world is caught up in the notion that these are great books. They are boring and run of the mill. Rowling should try to be a little more original and exciting. The books are no better than the ""Babysitter's club"" or ""Nancy Drew Files"". If you want GOOD books, go to the library and look around, they're not hard to find."
1,Harry potter,Bad hate it not worth buying. Lego and the world is going through my mind and the rest. Rise in addition
3,"Regular, NOT origanal fantasy...","The Harry Potter books are okay, and I'm not going to bother putting in a summary or anything, since everytone already knows what happens, but I think that these books are pretty regular, predictable, and the writing is a bit dull. They're definately not as great as everyone believes, and I've read lots of books that are better. Or maybe it's just my taste."
3,What's all the fuss?,"The book is like a cotton candy, in that kids would find it delightful and would want more servings, but adults would find it insubstantial at best. It is, however, perfectly ""G""-rated, i.e. no profanities, etc, and has a genuinely sweet spirit.However, this book is far from ""Little Prince"", the only ""fantasy"" book for kids that continue to impact me as an adult.If you're an adult, do buy it, however, for your kids, nieces, and nephews."
5,Extra! Extra! Harry Potter!,"Harry Potter was just an ordinary boy until a giant comes through the door saying he was a wizard. Of course, Harry couldn't talk with all the excitment. He gets to go to school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When he gets there, he finds two friends. Ronald Weasly and Hermione Granger. But a teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape, is going to steal the sorcerer's stone. Is Harry going to save the stone? Is Snape going to steal the sorcerer's stone or not?"
5,Absolutely amazing!,I started reading these books thinking that they would probably suck but boy was I wrong. I love the adventure in these books. Especially when they sneek out in the middle of the night in hogwarts to have a duel with Malfoy who is the kind of Harrys' nemesis. I highly recomend this book to anyone who likes adventure mysteries.
5,I WISH I COULD GIVE IT MORE STARS!,"I love this book! On a scale of one to ten, I rate it 20!:) Harry Potter is the best book ever. I've read all three, and I just loved them. I liked them so much I got the UK version of each! My mom's read them too. All hail Harry Potter!"
5,"Harry Potter in Hebrew, at last!","I read the reviews of the Harry Potter books in Newsweek and Time Magazine months ago. It has finally been translated into Hebrew and arrived at the book stores here in Israel last week, and I rushed to buy it for my 11 year old son. He read it within 24 hours and says it is the best book he has ever read. He loved the plot, the characters, the descriptions and the humorous tone. He can't wait for the other books to come out in Hebrew."
4,"An ""older"" reader's view","The first book of the series, Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone establishes what might become the most beloved fantasy series since Lord of the Rings. I won't bother recapping the plot at this point since so many others have. Rather, I think it is important to look at how the novel interacts with the reader. Ostensibly aimed at younger readers, it never talks down to the reader nor does it coddle them. It deals with issues timely for its audience such as abandonment, fitting in, and school pressures. Ms. Rowling creates a world that is easy to get lost in yet remains grounded in the real world.All in all, and excellent beginning."
2,Harry potter,"Ordered by mistake, done reading, not the book i wanted....... would like a different book just learning my kindle thanks"
5,epic,this is one of my favourite books of all time. everyone should read it! and the whole series too. great book.
5,The best book in the world !,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book I'v ever read. One morning I read from 6:00AM to 1:00PM non-stop because it was so interesting. You can't put it down. I don't see how you could not like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You should read it!
5,Better than the movie,"Books after movies for me, I like that Harry comes off more put together in the books versus how they make him out in the movies. Looking forward to the rest of the series."
5,ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLY AMAZING!,"Without a doubt, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book I've ever read! It captures the imagination and whisks the reader to truly wonderful places. EVERYONE should read this--regardless of age! If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I definitely would; JK Rowling created a masterpiece!"
5,Harry Potter is a great book it is educational and also fun,Harry Poteter is a clever written book.It is full of fun and suprises.Harry Potter is one of the greatest written books ever.
5,Excellent,I REMEMBER READING THIS BOOK BACK IN 5th GRADE AND I STILL FIND JOY READING IT AFTER COLLEGE. NOTHING BEATS READING THE FIRST HARRY POTTER BOOK.
3,Easy reading for Tweens,"Easy reading for Tweens who want a simple story and are happy with all the hype. Personally I am happy for my eight year old to read this book, despite the theme of witchcraft. However I would be happier if she didn't read it."
3,poor quality of CD's,love the audio book story but several of the cd's did not play. cleaned the cd's but still hade some problems. on the different tracks.
5,Does anyone hate this book? Doubtful!,"What's not to like here? Kid sleeps under the stairs with relative who don't unstand him and BAM he's told he's a wizard in this secret society. What a great story and what a great character. There is nothing but fun adventure here, and from the first world to The End, it's a great read. If you haven't read this then get with the program and read it. These books are MUCH MUCH better than the movies, by the way."
3,Good for youth,"I read this book for a Young Adult Literature class at college. For those who like fantasy, magic and strange occurrences, this book delivers. It has dragons, witches, potions, spells, wizards, tricks, and suspense. It also gives a realistic view of youthful alienation and discouragement. However, if you want something more realistic, insightful, and more connected to world issues, look elsewhere."
4,MY Book Talk,"I'm doing my book talk on harry potter and the socerer's stone. The author is J.K. rowling,and this is a fantasy/fiction book about magic and wizardry. The main character is harry potter and he is mistreated by his aunt,uncle, and cousin. He also has a scar shaped like a lightning bolt on his forehead. His uncle makes him live in a closet at his uncle's house. And he has not had a birthday in 11 years. But all this will change when he recieves a letter from owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that harry-and anyone who reads about him- will find unforgetable. (Read interesting part) this book is for 9-15 year olds"
4,Rereading Harry potter,As good as I remembered. Some of the parts were a bit corny but still a good read for even adults.
5,Ten-star rating. :),"The first book of the Harry Potter saga is filled of humour and surprising turns. I love this book, and, if I got the chance, I would recommend it to my younger brother, in the hope that he would produce the habit of reading."
2,good but not the best,"I have repeatedly read this book. It's an excellent book, with believable characters and a very fresh, imaginative plot. However, there is a lot of old ideas simply rewritten and compiled together. In fact, the whole series is like that. Sorcerer's Stone? Basilisk? Veela? A lot of these have been used and reused but not presented to a child audience. How clever. Also, the books seem to fall apart very easily. Not very well-made.In conclusion, a good read but not worthy of the Newberry Award, not only because of the unimaginative writing but also because the book was written and published in Britain."
3,Am I the only person who DIDN'T like this book?,"I'm a big fan of science fiction and fantasy but this book doesn't hold a candle to ""The Hobbit"" or Anne McCaffrey's series. It's written like a Saturday morning adventure show. I can really imagine the movie....but literature, it's not."
2,has anyone ever read REAL fantasy???,"if these books can get so overrated, there must be NO one out there who has read real fantasy. i mean, other fantasy books could use a bit of credit...especially Garth Nix's. besides, some of the events are too vulgar for the intended audience. just a little review, if you liked the series, try reading some REAL fantasy someday."
2,I may be the only person in the world...,"I may be the only person in the world who didn't love this book. I don't think it's a bad book, but I don't understand the big excitement about it. The writing is pedestrian, the characters are not that well developed, and frequently things happen that we as readers had no idea were possible. For me, it reads like an interesting children's movie screenplay. My fourth grade son read it before I did, and he agrees. We both liked the beginning and we both liked the quiddich matches, but felt the rest of the book fell flat."
5,Holy Cow,"I heard about how J.K.Rowling had to type up each and every copy of this book with her typewriter when sending it to possibly interested publishers because she couldn't afford photocopies. Definitley no walk in the park, but what a fairytale story as possibly the most succesfull children's book ever. I LOVED this book, and that is no understatement, and I literally couldn't put it down. If it weren't for my obligations, I would have happily read it in one sitting. If you haven't bought it yet, I don't know what planet you're living on - buy it, and all those to come - take your phone off the hook, cancel all your appointments, and be ready for the most excellent adventure. Soon you too will be scratching the days off your calendar for the next release. And if, by some miracle, J.K.Rowling happens to be reading this (or anyone who has specific contacts to her), I ask you ""Why stop at seven?"" Keep going after his graduation PLEASE. Looking forward to the next Harry."
5,We couldn't put it down.,For years I've been trying to get my twelve year old to have a love for reading like me. This book has helped significantly. He's begging to read the whole series. Yesssssssssss!
2,Surprisingly unoriginal and rather boring I'm shocked to say,"I started to read Harry Potter with great enthusiasm having heard (as we all have) great things about it. It was a surprise to me that this first book is actually rather badly written, quite boring and surprisingly derivative. It wouldn't take a fantasy fan long to come up with a list of the sources of most of the ideas in the book. How anyone can call it original is beyond me. Maybe I've just read too much of the much superior source stuff (like Roald Dahl and Terry Pratchett). However I can understand its appeal as its blends Enid Blyton and Adrian Mole into the cauldron of fantasy ficton and therein lies its only shred of originality. However I've been told the books get better so I'm reserving final judgement until I complete them all..."
4,Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone,"The setting of the book was at Hogwarts and all around the school and outside the school. The main characters were Harry,Hagrid,Ron,Harmani. What happens is Harry finds out he's a wizard and he goes to Hogwarts. He then finds out about the Sorcerers stone is at Hogwarts and all the teachers are trying to protect it from Voldamort who wants to steal it.I thought the book was pretty good but long. It had lots of action you really don't want to stop reading it."
5,ALL MUGGLES&WIZARDS! MUST READ!,"Hey Everyone! I loved this book so much. The detail is great. Harry Potter attends Hogwarts...a school for magic. Where he meets intersting people like wizards, nice friends, trolls, dragons...it's a very spectacular book. You are missing out on many, many, many, things if u don't read this. Once u read the 1st you will have to read the 2,3,4. You can't stop! I recommend the Harry Potter series to everyone! J.K. Rowling has become my favorite author. She is a very creative author! Five stars!"
3,used book,this book price was great but it was a little dirtier than usual with a smashed bug or worse in the last page
5,The Most Wonderful Book I've ever met,"This is so wonderful to read this wonderful book which drew all my attention into the description, even though I am no longer a child. I have told every my friend that this is definitely the only book that kept me from all other ordinary stuff and had my whole concentration on, in recent years. J.K. Rowling's fluent and clear description made me want to read more and I'd say that I hate this feeling of waiting my the other three books, which have been ordered on Amazon.com. In my view, the Harry Potter books are not only for the kids but for adults, especially for those who still have dreams and wanna believe the old and fansanating legends and stories. I would hold my breath when I read the threat of Voldemort and be relieved after reading Dumbledore's explanation toward Harry. This book has satisified my magical imagination and inspired me to ""dream"" a lot.... I'm really looking forward to reading more about the story soon."
5,IF YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO READ GET THIS BOOK,i am 13 and i hating reading for fun before this book. I thought that only wierd people would like this book so i got it to see how stupid it was. The next day i was hooked. It really is a great book. For advanced readers like me to the youngest kids and their parents
5,I am HOOKED on Harry Potter now,"I have only read Sorcerer's Stone so far, but I do NOT plan on stopping there, I plan to go out and buy the other two ASAP. Before Harry Potter, basically the only book series I read was the Redwall series, and I still love Redwall, but now that I've read Harry Potter books I've found something even better than Redwall."
5,Engaged from the Start,"I got the UK adult edition to add to my collection that complements the U.S. version. Unlike the U.S. versions however, all UK editions (for adults and children) do not contain chapter art."
5,A Real Realistic Fiction Novel,"My brother started reading this book and recommended it to me. Of course, I thought this is just going to be another one of those fairy tales books. To my surprise, I felt endulged in this book and read it everywhere, under the covers when I'm supposed to be asleep or during class when I 'm supposed to be studying. I turned page after page. By the time I was done with the first one I had started on the second one. Soon most of my friends were reading it. It appeared at book fairs and carnivals and bookstores all over the world. I can't wait to see the movie!"
5,Harry Sweeps Nation!,A great book for everyone! A terrific book from cover to cover! I myself have read this book 2 times with the second time being the best. It is charming and exciting from the day he leaves his awful relatives. This book has charmed it's way into my heart and hopefully yours! I would definitely recommend this book for all readers 3rd grade and up. Even adults should try it! So read this book! Happy Reading or maybe from the wizarding world EXPELLILARMIUS!
2,ISBN 059035342X hardcover - AWFUL quality of paper and prinitng,This review is NOT about content of the book (which I and my kids really like) but rather specific hardcover edition (ISBN 059035342X hardcover w/ no DJ).DO NOT BUY IT! Paper is gray and low contrast and quality is worse than what's used for many newspapers. It's nowhere near the quality of original hardcover edition.It's also NOT cut/bound correctly so end of line is higher on some pages than the beginning of this same line; very annoying.Find some other printing if you want a hardcover edition.
5,Buy this book!,"I got this book thinking ""wow, this cover looks interesting,"" and now I can't stop telling people to buy it and read it! I'm a college student and I can say in all honesty that this book will keep any reader of any age interested. It's one of the best books I've read in a long time!"
4,Got this adult back into reading!,"This may sound silly, but I credit this book for getting me back into reading. I hadn't read much in many years, but as I began to hear all the Harry Potter hype, I decided to give Book 1 a try and found it delightful, especially for a ""children's"" tale. After the HP series (which was about 4 deep at the time), I reread both the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series and the ""Lord of the Rings"" series (including ""The Hobbit"") and then just kept reading (and not just fantasy stuff, either!). Thanks, JK Rowling, for leading me back to books!"
5,Excellent Book,"In my opinion, I think that this book should recieve the Newberry Book Award. I found it very exciting and can run your imagination wild. I absolutly love the book. There might be 1 or 2 dull moments, but it's extremly excellent. You may think it's very uneducational, but I think it's an extremly extreme book for the first book of the ""Harry Potter"" series."
4,Why We Like Harry,"I just finished rereading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I must have first read it when I was the same age as Harry in this book, and while I didn't love it then, I find it charming now. I've read the books as they have grown increasingly darker, and it is refreshing to return to when Harry was an eager young wizard, not an angry teenager.The world of Hogwarts comes to life vividly, with all the fantastic creatures and people Harry meets. The story is simple, but original. I don't think the Harry Potter books are classics, but they are entertaining. And really, what more are we looking for in a book like this?These books are popular, I know, but don't expect to be bowled over by glorious, poetic prose. The writing in this book is solid, but not brilliant, and sometimes even clunky.Read, and be entertained."
5,Both Younge and Old. Everyone will love this Amazing Book!!,"Who cares if it's a childs book? I'm 32, I bought it for my son, and strangely enough I was the one who read it twice, and once to my son. 'Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone' is one of the most funniest, outgoing books I have read in a long time!! I can not wait to read all the others coming soon!!!! THIS IS A ABSOLUTE MUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Harry Potter Books,"This is the best series in the world. The writing is very descriptive and the author make the book appear to be written from a 13 year olds point of view. You can feel the excitement during the games or the suspense just as a teacher rounds the corner and they are almost caught. I cannot wait for the rest of the series to come out...these first three books were so good, I read them all in 2 days!"
5,I KEEP READING IT OVER AND OVER!!!!!!,I thought it was the best! I'm 18 and my little bro read it! He recomended it to me. I must admit i was first a little sceptical. But beleive me that it deserves all the praise it has gotten and is worth it to read!
5,Great Beginning to a great adventure,"...To have a book make me smile while I am reading it, and discuss it excitedly with friends, to make conversation with strangers you see reading it on the commuter train in the mornings... that is the mark of a great book. This book thrilled me because of the plot twists, (I never saw some things coming), the remarkable breadth of the characters (Snape is so hateful, yet is emerging as one of the most intriguing characters of them all, and in this book, you get to see his first encounter with Harry.) If one wants to read Harry, definitely, they can only start with this book. Some complain the book is not well written, or sophisticated. Who cares? This book hooked me from beginning to end, (and so many other readers) that it truly is a phenomenon. This book deserves to be a classic with a long, long shelf life. Once you get past Chapter 1, you're hooked for ever. And considering that Rowling, like the rest of us is just a Muggle, that is true magic."
5,"Absolutely fantastic book,the best i will ever read!","Harry Potter and The Philosophers Stone is about a young wizard whose parents died under an attack by The Dark Lord Voldemort and Harry escapes unharmed, but with a large lightning shape scar on his forehead.Harry then grows up with his horrible muggle aunt,uncle and cousin.One day Harry receives a letter, but before Harry can read it his uncle snatches it off him.More and more letters come for Harry everyday until his uncle finally goes mad and they all move out into a house in the middle of the sea. There in the middle of the night he meets Hagrid who tells him all about his past. Then in september Harry goes to Hogwarts,the school for witches and wizards and thats when the excitement starts......."
5,Entertaining and exciting!,"I picked up this book just to see what the hype was all about. After reading the first three chapters I was absolutely hooked! Harry is such a likable character! With all his adventures in his new school and his insecurites in facing his new endeavors, it isn't hard to see why this book has captured the hearts of kids of all ages. A little bit of mystery, a whole lot of fantasy and so much fun! Bravo! It's about time a book like this came out to get kids excited about reading! I can't wait to dive into the second and third ones!"
5,Is a 10 for The Whole Fam,"An exciting and mysterious story of a wizarding boy by the name of Harry Potter, this book appeals to readers of all ages. Being a muggle, Harry starts his adventures with his evil Aunt and Uncle, eventually being bombarded by letters until they have no choice but to let him go to Hogwarts Wizarding School. He lives his parents name to the fullest no matter if he's up to trouble late at night with Ron and Hermoine or playing Quidditch, the game of many balls. This book was most interesting because it opens the mind to new worlds and ideas. You dont realize that theses ideas are too extreme until it closes each night. Also it leaves you feeling curious, it draws you towards future books, you never know the complete truth of Harry's life. Children will sleep at night dreaming of magic, not of nightmares of the evil Voldemort, its not too scary, just enough to keep you interested. A true classic in the making, don't u think Constance? Love your main man Mr. B!"
5,Harry Potter rules!,"In Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone Harry and his family was cursed by a evul wizard. Harry's parents had died but Harry was the boy who lived.In that pioerd Harry stayed with his anunt and unckle. He got a letter telling that he could come to Hogwarts. They would not let him go,so Hagrid came and got him. Harry was very famous at Hogwarts,he was a seccer on the Qittich team. Voltimore tryed to steal the sorcerers stone,a stone that would make you emortal. But Harry stoped him. It was one of my faviote books and I hope it will be yours to!"
5,"very, very, VERY GOOD BOOK!!!!!!","A funny Book that really shows the Witch or Wizard in all of us. Enough characters, bad or good, to make a book just right. A MUST READ for kids and adults!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"This book was super, wonderful that is if you are a wizard.","I loved how Harry always got in trouble and found every thing out. I love all the weird things the have at Hogwarts, such as going thourgh a picture who visted other pictures and you had to say ""Pig Snout"" to find a tunnle behind it that you would go follow to get to your room."
5,A Wicked Awesome Adventure,This first book in the Harry Potter series was one of the best. The characters created by the author make the book hard to put down. In this book Harry becomes a hero for vanquishing the powers of the evil sorcerer Lord Voldemort.The plot thickenss when someone tries to steal the sorcerer's stone which can make you immortal. It also has the power to turn any metal into pure gold. This is a great book for young and old alike.
4,An excellent book for kinetic theory,"Chapman and Cowling's outstanding work for kinetic thoery.This book is regarded as a Classic in this field. However,the notations are not so farmiliar to me. So I was somewhat perplexed at first.more introductory texts are,J. Jeans ' An introduction to the kinetic theory of gases'E.H. Kennard 'Kinetic theory of gases with an introduction to statistical mechanics'"
1,Buyer Beware,"In theory this is a great product - sunglasses that you can work out in. However, the quality and customer service is horrendous. I have already sent them back twice and Oakley insists that I will need to pay for them as they claim it has sweat damaged. First of all, I hardly used them. Secondly, why have an athletic product that can withstand sweat? What a bunch of morons.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU DON'T SWEAT AT ALL!!!!!!"
2,Only if you like blue shadows,"While I was initially thrilled with the power of 144X zoom on my Canon Power Shot, I soon found that the pictures were blurred and had blue and yellow edges on all principal objects. I purchased the Canon 1.5 converter lens and am much happier with it."
3,Could be better,"Basic concept is good. Although there is a section that teaches each exercise (Learn These Movements), when you do Phase I the instructor does the movements too quickly without any guidance along with it. Of course this is just my opinion, but I think there should be a repeat of the description of each movement as you go through each one. I also think that doing the movements a little more slowly would give the students time to learn the correct form making the movements more effective. This would probably only be necessary for Phase I since Phase II and III are the same movements but repetitions and holds are increased. On the whole this DVD is worth buying and using.Pfilates"
4,Frustrating Ipod Controls,Hooking your ipod up to this receiver is a great feature. Navigating to music on your ipod however is not. It would probably take me fifteen minutes to scroll through all the artists on my 60gb ipod. So basically you will only use your ipod for listening to playlists and shuffling through all songs. Sound using the PANASONIC CA-DC300U DIRECT CABLE(not included costs ~$30-40) is a lot cleaner than using a standard aux cable. I recommend this receiver.
4,Very Interesting,"I heard good things about this documentary, and the brief outline I got of the subject matter intrigued me. I found the movie engaging and well made. The subject matter did not disappoint; it held my attention the whole time. The tiles are introduced and explained in detail, and in a systematic way that I appreciated. The narrative follows the three main characters on their hunt for clues chronologically. The way they continually revealed new hints kept me glued to the screen. Definitely worth a watch."
2,Useful but disappointing,"This book provides a useful description of the entire process of writing manuscripts, from information acquisition and literature searches to a very lengthy description of the editing process. There is very little information on the actual contents of the manuscript. I was looking for an in-depth description of each section of the manuscript and possibly some suggestions or helpful hints. Writing of the manuscript and the contents of each section is limited to a few sentences on each section. I was looking for a book that guides someone early in their scientific career through the process of writing the actual manuscript, rather than focusing so heavily on the editing process, as this book does."
4,Great forJunior Graduate Students in the Sciences,"I am a senior graduate student in molecular biology and purchased this book in preparation for writing manuscripts and my dissertation. The book is very comprehensive and detailed. For me, it was a little too detailed in the wrong areas. I've done a lot of writing and I'm looking for more structural/insider tips as opposed to sentence structure and tense. The book covers grammar, delivering presentations, preparing figures, etc over several chapters. The sections on actually writing and publishing your manuscript are covered in two shorter chapters -- if you need more guidance here, consider looking elsewhere. I'm looking to convince my audience and develop strong arguments and I didn't find it in this book."
2,I donot receive the order!!,I donot receive the order!!I also cannot find a phone or email to report this problem ????
4,good book for the beginner,Good book for the beginner. Lots of information. Everything you need to know to get started.
4,CNC PROGRAMING HANDBOOK 3RD EDITION,"THE BOOK IS VERY THOROUGH ALTHOUGH SOMEONE WHO HAS READ IT AHEAD OF ME SAYS IT MEARLY SCRATCHES THE SURFACE. IT GO'S INTO MANY ASPECTS OF CNC;LIKE CONTROL PANNEL, PLANES, OFSETS AS WELL AS THE MECHANICS OF THE MACHINE TOOL. I HAVE ALREADY HAD ONE COWORKER OFFER TO BUY IT FROM ME. THIS IS PROBABLY A GREAT BOOK TO START WITH. THEN GET OTHER BOOKS TO GET INTO SPECIFICS WITH AS WEAKNESSES ARE DETERMINED. THE BOOK CONTAINS ENOUGH INFO TO MAKE A JOURNEYMAN LEVEL MACHINIST WITHOUT GETTING INTO TO MANY SPECEFICS TO CAUSE CONFUSION FOR THE BEGGINNER."
3,Book review,"The book was in good condition. It came as advertised and had the CD included. Overall, I was pleased with the book."
3,Very good book but,"I like the layout of the book. The way it is devided into small chapter makes contents in each chapter focused and easier to read.However I found that the writer don't understand a mathematic concept and explanations on some formular are wrong, In mathematic, devide any number by zero is not defined but the book said the result is zero which is incorrect. There are some spelling errors as well. Hand book should be perfect."
3,Some evidences,"Tom, could you please at least read the book?Take it from someone who *read* the book.I don't care much about english in the book and I totally agree that it is a good book but it could have been better. Apart from mathematical incorrect, some of the examples in the book also incorrect. Look in page 311 programe O3503 for example.Look in page 53 for the word ""theses""Look in page 190 for ""it this case""Look in page 287 for ""That may me a little..""Look in page 321 for "",can be also be programmed...""There are more.Finally, if you are doing cnc programming, buy the 2nd book. Perhaps you will not get these mistakes.Bye, I have to go and study some more english. :)"
5,Compelling & Addictive,"A Confidential Source is a big-time mystery in small-town Proivdence, Rhode Island.A fast paced read with beleiveable characters and unpredictable plot twists. I was hooked from the opening murder scene in a local supermarket to the very last chapter that caps off the mass corruption.Highly reccomended."
3,"Good book, but one major flaw","I like this book, and I'm in favor of Israel in this conflict. However, the problem with this book is simple: it doesn't even attempt to present two sides to the story. It is so full of sniveling and whining against the Palestinians that it grates on your nerves after 30 pages. It doesn't present one single argument in the Palestinians' favor. It's just whining, whining, whining from Israelis, who fail to see that their actions may have some role in the current mess we're in."
3,Typo's Galore,"I think the idea behind this book is fantastic and if there wern't so many typos and mistakes in the diagrams and project schematics it would be a 5 star book.The ground and power bus is mislabeld in almost every project. Some of the projects won't run without fixing the bugs in the diagrams.If there is a second edition, hopefully these issues will be resolved."
5,Digital Electronics made easy and fun!,This book is fantastic. The two included PCBs were a joy to build and are very helpful when doing lab experiments. This book would appeal to an absolute electronics beginner as well as an expert. The projects are fun and very educational. Two thumbs up!
4,"i am sorry to say, but you're all wrong.","this isn't related to eddie vedder, and since when is eddie vedder a god?my favorite part is how someone said ""unlistenable noise.""you obviously didn't realize that this was A NOISE ALBUM.i give it four stars."
1,worst radio in history!,"I have ordered about 5 of the same pogo crap radios and have had to send them all back! They all have worked great for appoximately a month. Then they just stop recording!! What is up with this crap radio?? Don't buy it, you will hate it too! It should be called the experimental boomerang radio!"
2,Not worth the money,"The sound quality is very poor and tinny, batteries will not last a week of use, and radio reception is poor with much static even on local stations. This is a classic example of too many features that neither stands out. Better to buy a quality product if you are looking for MP3 player for a good music sound and a radio for those features. I made a mistake buying this. Its junk."
1,Greg,Serious disappiontment. Playback for FM and line-in recording is on voice file with very poor sound quality. Battery life is terrible - 3 hours or less just listening to radio. Pogo Products customer service is the worst I've ever experienced.
5,Radio VCR,"This little unit is perfect to record shows like JIM ROME, Phil Hendrie, Dr. Laura, Rush Limbaugh ""Insert Radio Host here"" or the ball game that won't be on TV and on during your work hours....Pogo also has a great Tech Support staff that quickly helps you in case of any problems and they respond to all emails lightning quick.All and all you should get it if a Radio VCR is something you been wanting for years."
1,No Reception!,"Bought this for recording NPR shows, and I live in an area where the radio signal is very strong. I cannot get reception for more than one (unidentified) FM channel, so this is worthless to me. You would think for the price that they would pay attention to the quality of the radio they include in the device, but that doesn't appear to be the case.I was VERY DISAPPOINTED, guess I will wait for a newer generation version from another manufacturer, and stick with my iPod for the time being."
1,NO GO for POGO,"I love the concept of having an ""all in one"" device and I was especially excited about the ability to record am talk shows, however I could NOT have been more dissapointed. The unit was cumbersome, and often froze up. The controls were awkward and the instructions for use were confusing. The software had multiple glitches and was difficult to use. You had to have a separate memory card to hold more than 3 or 4 songs on the mp3 (an additional expense). My advice: WAIT...this concept will be improved in the future but it is not there yet."
3,"Great for talk radio, not so great for music playback","I got this because I like to listen to talk radio late at night before I go to sleep and my favorite show is on when I am at work and I can't listen to it. Radio Your Way is fantastic for this but when I tried listening to music on this, the music sounded awful. I don't like the headphones either."
4,Great,My dad has been using this cologne for as long as I can remember apparently he really likes it because he religiously gets a refill. I decided to buy this for him for father's day and the shipping was so fast it was awesome!
1,Re-confirming: Do Not Use with HP All-in-One,"These labels killed my HP6500. There are comments with similar experiences above, but I wanted to start a new thread for folks to see... Am now out the cost a full set of brand new ink cartridges and a printer, and turn-around time of several days to get a new printer and still don't have the dang labels! At this point, it would have been cheaper & faster to have used an on-line printer - even with higher min quantities!(I had already purchased the labels from a different source and therefore didn't see the warnings on Amazon or would have avoided the experience! *Always check those Amazon reviews!* ;0)"
5,killjoy 3,the item worked fine. the item was just as it was described. i got the item. there was nothing wrong with the item.
2,I Farted 3 Times While Watching This Movie!,"Killjoy 3 is a pretty dang inaccurate title for this horror sequel. It didn't kill me and didn't bring me dang joy. Oh, but I did fart 3 times while watching it. Killjoy 3 is a pretty dang stupid movie, and not as much fun as some other recent movies from Full Moon Pictures. Gingerdead Man 3 would be a dang better choice if you want a Full Moon movie with a dang ""3"" in its title."
5,"Woodcarving Tools, Materials & Equipment is Outstanding!","Chris is an English carver with a vast knowledge of tools and carving history. This not your typical wood carving book with remedial carving instructions and patterns for spirits and gnomes. In fact there are ""no"" patterns in this book.The book has a very thorough description of every carving tool imaginable and a discussion of how many of them are made commercially and explains how others can be made at home. He also tells you how to modify existing tools--reshaping, grinding, and bending. He included a very good explanation on how to anneal, harden, and temper your own carving tools.I first opened this book, early one evening, intending to read for an hour or so; I finally set it down at 2:00am. In one session, I learned more than enough to justify the cost."
5,"Wow, excellent book on carving tools!","This is not a book on carving, it is a book about the tools and etc. The sections on selecting and sharpening tools are spot on. Mr. Pye writes very well; this is a good read.Highly recommended"
1,THIS IS NOT THE METAL BAND CRISIS,"I was very disappointed when I received this CD. The review said it was the Metal band Crisis. It is not. It is an Electronic band from Europe. If you like Electronic, you would probably like. Otherwise, avoid this!"
3,Umm.. What was that again?,"I actually got lost in this book. I don't understand hedge funds and banking that well, so reading this book took a lot out of me. I was thinking so hard trying to understand what it all meant, how it all tied into the plot, that I missed out on the rest of the story. I finished this book feeling incomplete. I wasn't sure if I figured out who the real bad guy was, who the spies were, etc. I also got lost in trying to figure out how Jackie investigating Hayek and the banking stuff tied in with the congressman and his wife and this so called smear campaign. Overall, I rate this book with 3 stars. I liked the descriptions, but I couldn't fully grasp this story. If you understand hedge funds, politics, and banking then you could probably read it and enjoy it. But this book was not my favorite!"
2,Inaccuracies Plague Story,"Mr Bunn's biography on the end flap says ""raised in North Carolina, taught in Switzerland, worked in Africa and the Middle East, and served as direct in Germany, currently lives in England."" I can only wonder if he has ever spent much, if any, time at all in Florida. Having lived in Orlando for the past twenty-one years, I find it extremely annoying to read a novel about my city that is so full of inaccuracies. His geography is all mixed up, his roads are confused, and even the weather is incorrectly represented. In the twenty-one years I've been here, it never once hit 100 degrees, and certainly no where near that in April, for heaven's sake! Maybe this wouldn't bother someone who doesn't live here, but there's an old, but correct, saying: ""Write about what you know."" Mr Bunn simply does not know Orlando. It ruined the story for me."
1,Very small!,"These coasters are only about 2.5"" in diameter and are about 1/4"" thick - an extremely awkward shape and size for any coaster. They will certainly not fit most standard vehicle cup holders. It would have been nice to have some size specifics in the Amazon listing."
1,LUVMYGIRLS,"Just received this product and was excited to let my 3 and 4 yr olds give them a whirl. First problem: 2 were cracked in the package. When you pay $15 for 24 crayons, that's no good. Second problem: they barely make a mark w/o extreme pressure, even the darker ones. I could barely make them work, especially against the background of a coloring book. They work a bit better on white paper but that wasn't what I had in mind. Guess my expectations were too high. Thinking I will return them."
3,Predictable,This is a good rainy Sunday chick flick. Nothing special but cute and happy story. Demi Moore and Jeff Daniels are better than this movie allowed them to be.
5,A wonderful guide for developing a personal spirituality...,"Lama Surya Das has written a wonderful sequel to his last book, ""Awakening the Buddha Within."" This effort connects buddhist and eastern practices with daily western life. It will help us in the West develop our own spiritual life and practices without the baggage of eastern cultural traditions. Humerous and very personal stories of his own spiritual development sets a wonderful example of western spiritual awakening. Numerous meditations, chants, practices, etc. present many meaningful contributions to a daily practice. I know my personal spiritual practice will bloom as a result of reading this book."
5,Awakening to the Sacred: Creating a Personal Spiritual Life,"This book was warmly writtien and gave in depth information on Tibetan Buddhism, showing you how to connect it to your own faith."
5,Inspiring!,I love this book. It stirs my soul. Lama Surya Das speaks to the heart with warmth and clarity. Bunny Hull
3,Fritz,"I found this CD a bit boring, too much of it sounds like it could have come from any ""euro-pop"" album. There are a few interesting pieces that incorporate alpine arrangements and instruments but yet have a contemporary edge, but these don't compensate for what I felt was an otherwise generic sound to this CD."
5,A Great Gfunk Compilation !,"this cd is brought to us by shaft gangsta click. It contains 16 great tracks. The 16 tracks are not your ordinary rap affair they are a mix of boungy funky beats mixed in with some great rapping and hard lyrics. The more you listen to this album the better it sounds. Ive had this album for three years now and still dont get bored listening to it because its a refreshing change from mainstream rap and really focuses on the gfunk underground genre of rap. The cd is pretty hard to find now and is reaching up to 60 dollars on some shops , however i wouldnt let this put you off as its a great album and well worth the money."
4,YOU GOTTA READ BOOK AND SEE MOVIE,"The book is great. I read it about a year after seeing the movie. The movie was stirring and haunting, suffused with a feeling of loss and sadness. There was a lot of emphasis on the attorney's character, played so well by Ian Holm. Atom Egoyan is a terrific director (see EXOTICA! ).The book is the same story, only different. I felt completely different reading it, while acknowledging that it is telling the same story. The same, and yet the tone is different, the details emphasized are different. And the character of the attorney has the same experiences as the one in the movie, but feels like a different person to me.I recommend both very highly. How often can you read a book and see a movie, then say, ""I loved the book, and I loved the movie too, even though it changed alot."""
5,A Tragedy and Its Aftermath,"This is a beautifully written book about the aftermath of a tragedy in a small New England town. A school bus accident kills many of the town's children and the novel examines the complexity of grief, hope, and the need for assignment of blame - - blame to make sense of and sort out the unfathomable. It examines how people withdraw into themselves, uniting only in the commonality of their shared tragedy. Each person deals with the tragedy deeply and we are given witness to the strength and resilience of some vs. the fragility and hopelessness of others.The novel is told from the vantage point of three townspeople - - the bus driver, a 14 year-old survivor and the parent of 2 dead children - - and a lawyer. The lawyer has come to town to find clients in order to build a case and help assign blame.This is an incredible book, multi-layered, beautifully written, and one that you will not soon forget."
4,"A short, insightful read","This book is a quick read, which somehow, for me is a disappointment. I found the premise very intriguing and I liked the way each chapter is devoted to one character, so we can see how the accident has affected each of them. The atmosphere of a small town is nicely depicted. Of all the characters, Nichole comes across as the strongest, and it is her chapter that I enjoyed the most.Overall, a good book, full of humanity. I haven't seen the movie, but I am looking forward to."
5,A compelling look at a small town tragedy,"Do you believe in omens? I picked up this book because I had heard what a great film was made from the book. I have not seen the film but was intrigued by the plot. I started reading the book and was suprised to see it was set in Essex County, New York where I grew up. I had no knowledge of this before purchasing the book. The real bizarre turn came when the book came to an end. The last scene of the book occurs in the town of Sam Dent at the County Fair's Demolition Derby. Believe it or not, I grew up in that town. It's called Westport, New York and Mr. Banks describes the fairgrounds perfectly. What are the odds of a person picking up a book at random and discovering it is set in his hometown of roughly 700 people? Perhaps that is one reason I found the book so compelling. It really felt that I knew those four people."
5,I read this book in 4 hours one Sunday afternoon.,"Absolutely excellent book, literally could not put it down. Admittedly, I had seen the movie first and the book is, as another reviewer said, twice as good."
4,Beatiful but Dispassionate,"Russel Banks is a truly accomplished writer and ""The Sweet Hereafter"" serves to cement that reputation. Beautifully written and constructed, Banks accomplishes a rare feet in narrating the events from four seperate viewpoints--each of which comes across authentic.Many reviews have called this novel depressing, a reading I dispute. Like any good tragedy the novel employs extreme cirumstances--events which violently disrupt the lives of those involved. But as the novel progresses, so to do the characters. Perseverance in the face of tragedy is, in my view, a triumph of human nature and it is rarely expressed so eloquently.As beautiful as the novel is, it sometimes leaves the reader feeling cold and analytical. The prose has a tendency to lull the reader, rendering him or her placid and unfeeling. At times you wish Banks would break out with some raw emoting, but it rarely happens."
2,"A quick read, but a lackluster ending","This book is a quick read and keeps your attention throughout, but at the end I found it unsatisfying. The author weaves an interesting, though tragic, story, which leaves the reader heading hopefully towards an exciting finish. But the ending left me empty because it seemed like I missed it. The story had no climax; it just sort of ended. Based on this, I would not recommend the book."
1,Awful!!,"I was assigned to read this book over the summer by my school, and I had to unpleasantly plow my way through this book. I did not enjoy this book at all. The characters got on my nerves SO much; all they did was whine and complain about things not even related to the accident, and I hated the way they thought. I couldn't read this book for more than 30 minutes at a time; it bored me too much. I feel like this book had no point to it at all. I didn't learn any ""lessons,"" nor did I find myself even relating to the characters at any point during the story. Sorry, this book was just really, really awful."
3,"Good plot, but very boring!!","When one reads this particular novel and begins to find all the symbols that exist, one will eventually see that it can be said to be a good book. What one must realize is unless you analize the book to death and go beyond what it is saying in text, you will find it quite dull. A proud to be Seneca College Accounting and English Student!!"
5,Brilliant!,"This book is amazing. Its narrative, presented from four utterly engrossing points of view, turns on an awful event, a fatal school bus crash in a small Adirondack town. Every time I drive down a snowy Connecticut street, I think of Dolores, the bus driver, and her bus full of kids. Russell Banks gives us, with his sparkling narration, a brilliant array of moral questions and human emotions. After reading this book I felt enriched, saddened, and thrilled by his art. The overall themes of this work are terrible loss and riveting transformation. Read it."
3,The author attempts to make the main characters too big.,"I read the book because I work in the school bus field as a trainer. I found the book interesting in its character presentation but flawed in the technical area, primarily in the climactic ending where Nicole states the bus was going 75 miles per hour. Even with more more powerful engines and improved drivetrains, today's newest school bus models will not exceed 65 miles per hour under the most ideal conditions such as downhill on an interstate highway with a light load or empty. In addition, there is almost no way a passenger can view the speedometer on the type of bus that was portrayed in the book. I know these are not big things but they did take away from my reading of it."
2,NOTHING SWEET AND NO HEREAFTER,"I have no idea where they came up with this title. There is nothing sweet about this book. It's hard to read because you have kids dying, it's excruciatingly slow and the end leaves you annoyed. It was well written and I'm sure it has an audience that likes these extremely sad types of books, but it's not me. OH! And what the heck's up with the picture on the front?? Did I read a different book because there is nothing even CLOSE to what would bring about this picture!"
5,Better than the film,"I've recently become enamored of this author's writings, and started reading his previous novels. In comparison to the film based on this novel, The Sweet Hereafter created a more lasting response within me after reading it."
5,Teen Power and Integrity,"As a high school teacher, I think our kids seek authentic stories and issues above all--yet so much of what is out there is cynical and discourages their own sense of power in the world. This book offers an accessible, engaging story about a perfectly ordinary tragedy (if such a thing exists), around which characters familiar to any modern teen converge in the hope of establishing responsibility, or perhaps more of assigning guilt. At the center of the tale is a young girl whose life has been changed, for better as well as for worse, who slowly realizes that she holds the power to perpetuate the pain or to begin the healing. Her choice angers some powerful adults, but affirms our better instincts and validates the notion that young people can change the world."
4,The Sweet Hereafter,Brings to life an Adironondack community. He knows his territory. Also an excellent examination of the ways a disaster can destroy a small tightly-knit community. A good read.
5,Infinitely sad and yet almost therapeutic,"This is the story of a town that lost many of its children in a schoolbus accident. I read this book a long time ago after suffering a great loss of my own, but rather than making me sadder strangely it made me feel better. Banks communicates the terrible loneliness and isolation that surrounds and overwhelms the parents, the surviving victim, and even an attorney who is planning to sue for damages (who has himself lost a daughter to drugs).Banks' chacters have feelings that are genuine and human rather than stereotypically ""bad"" or ""good."" Because the characters are flawed and struggling with those faults, it avoids sentimentality. I identified with many of them.If you have avoided this book because of its tragic story, I urge you, ""Don't"". I can think of no other author who can convey the emotions of ordinary people as well as Banks.I would not have believed it, but it made me feel better."
3,"Good service, good delivery time, less than 'good as new' condition","I purchased the Sweet Hereafter: A Novel listed as 'good as new.' This was not the case. This book should have been labeled as used. The cover was frayed, the pages were a bit worn and many sentences in the book had been underlined.On the other hand, the price was great, and the delivery time was good.As for the novel itself, this is a wonderfully written, sad story. See the movie.It's one of the best independent films I've ever seen. Ian Holm and every other actor is superb.The Sweet Hereafter"
2,Lowest Common Denominator - And DO SOME RESEARCH,"Why is this author so reverred? As an attorney, I was totally turned off, and could no longer suspend my disbelief in this syruppy nonsense of a novel, especially when he got to the lawyer's story which was so unbelievable as to make me angry enough to throw this book against the wall. First, so a bus went over a cliff killing some kids. That's original fodder for a novel? No one else thought that was emotional enough of a subject to write about? And then the lawyer comes and commits all kind of ethical violations (in person solitication is unethical) and is going to pursue a ""class action"" lawsuit? Huh? No, he would represent each kid's estate and try and get something. Only thing is, these cases are not normally million dollar cases. Kids just don't generate much money in lost wages. The writing was decent and so I gave it two stars. But that was being generous."
4,Better than the first,"This book, although a little bit of a let down, was a better read that the first. I am looking forward to the next book in the series, somewhat. This book brings in a few different characters which help to evolve the seiries and help Alvin come closer to discovering what and who he actually is. If the first book tickled your fancy this one most likely will too."
4,"Really good, but a little repetitive","This sequel was very good, written with the same sytle as the awesome first book. My main problem was the repetetiveness of all the Reds. Okay, we get it, Whites have no feel for the land and the green music, and Reds are the chosen people. It seemed like every other stream-of-conciousness from Ta-Kumsaw was some variatiion on that idea. I also wish that the book had been more about Alvin. Despite these problems, Red Prophet was a very compelling read. It was just cool to see well-known historical figures moved about and manipulated to do things that they never did in reality. Harrison in particular gets the shaft. Also, Ta-Kumsaw's decision to fight the war despite his understanding that the land (which he holds in such high esteem) is against it, was a powerful comment on human nature. Also, Mike Fink's beating of Measure almost made me cry, I had to put the book down and relax for a while. Powerful stuff."
2,Odd,"I've enjoyed all the Ender books and the first Maker, but this one was just weird and seemed forced. Hasn't steered me off the series, but it did make me lose my OSC momentum....I'm reading other stuff for a while."
1,Kindle - Missing a large portion at the 95-96% mark,I don't know how much but it jumps from letter being delivered to napoleons betrayal.Flawed product that is charging full book prices. I expect this from freebies but not products this expensive.The story itself I like although I expect there to be varying opinion on the work. My rating is for the flaw in the kindle product.
4,Not as good as the first one,"This book was a disappoitment! I really longed to know what happens next to Alvin, and the characters of the first book, but this book doesn't bring anything new to it! It only raises more questions!Now, then. This still isn't a bad book. I liked the ways the indians were developed, I liked Napoleon's brief visit in the book, and I liked a lots of other things in it. This book would have been far better, if it had been a part of the first book. Still, I liked it so much that it is worth of four stars."
2,Too much Scott Card,"Orson Scott Card is definitively a great story teller. But from my point of view he has three kind of books:1 - When he writes as his characters. He is great when he does it. ""Ender's Game"" and ""Songmaster"" are the best Scott Card I've read.2 - When he is inspired by other books. ""The Worthing Saga"" is the main example of this situation. It's a great story, it's well told but yet when you read it, you may feel like you already knew it.3 - When he is too much of himself. ""Homecoming"" series are the main exponent of this. It's like he is trying to convince you about something instead of telling a story.Red Prophet is an example of type 3. The first book is quite better and between types 1 and 3.It is worth the money you pay for it, but is not gonna change you. You may agree or you may not, but won't change your life what is what you really expect from reading."
5,Well done,"You don't see too many native American point of view books, so I found that pretty interesting. It was a good take of how the natives really saw the colonial americans. If you like last of the mohicans you'd probably enjoy this book.Card shows good range as this is a different style of the ethical dilemmas presented in the Enders game series"
5,Loving the series,The pacing is a lot quicker that Seventh son. You'll have trouble putting this one down if you enjoyed Seventh Son.
4,Card delivers as usual,"The second volume of Alvin Maker continues the saga in fine, albeit bleak fashion. Tensions are escalating between Whites and ""Reds"" in an alternate frontier America where various folk magics really work. As usual one of my favorite authors shows his effortless storytelling brilliance in a tale that's vivid, intense, and at times heart wrenchingly moving."
3,6' minimum focus,"Apparently there has been a design change, no longer 36"" close focus... decent binoculars but weird stretchy neoprene socks to protect lens is very awkward and promotes leaving them off which isn't a good thing... I would check with Brunton for any design changes and compare part number with what is advertised and what you receive."
4,Good Book to Read BUT DON'T BUY for the exam,"It's a good book to have especially if you are an e-project manager. However, Cisco has discontinued the exams and as such don't waste your money buying this book for exam intentions. BUY the book if you would like to have a clear knowledge on e-architecture. Worth the money for knowledge."
5,Lathers Better,"Compared to the Olive & Aloe bar, this one seems to lather better. I've been very happy with this formula overall.I also tried the Olive & Honey bar, but it had a smell that was somewhat overwhelming."
3,"Worthy, but in this expansive set, hardly","Volume nine of ultra-diverse saxophonist and composer Zorn, with his amazing group of players, ventures into warping traditional Jewish music once again in this second to last of the Masada numbered series; already a vast project in an already downright intimidating catalog. Perhaps completionists may argue Tet, and quite a few of Zorn's other discs, do not really cover any new ground, and in the proficient but repetitious ninth volume of an overwhelmingly similar sounding Avant-Garde, post-bop, Israeli-influenced noise this decade-long project has articulated, one would be hard pressed to recommend this volume over a few other standout sessions. Capturing equal parts slow mystic noodling and blazing, irritated puncuations, Masada 9 offers a fine overview of the group's unique, intoxicating jazz interplay, though rarely steps over mere summations of what they have achieved more intensely and intricately on prior sets."
3,Okay,"... I'll watch any genre of horror movie, from slashers, gorefests, cheap thrills, and psychological. This had good acting, interesting story, but very predictable, stupid towns people, and uneeded nudity. They put that in, because the makers of this film new the audience would be bored. This is an okay film, but could have been alot better. I have this one on The Boogeyman/Devonsville Terror dvd. The Boogeyman is the superior. I guess when you have seen The Exorcist, all other horror films just seem tame."
3,Small Town Horrors,"This overlooked horror entry boasts eerie color photography and an interesting story about small town fears and prejudices. Three progressive woman arrive in a small town, and the locals fear they are the reincarnation of three witches destroyed by townsfolk hundreds of years ago. Some shocking violence against the woman guarantees some spectacular revenge. An interesting, worthwhile horror film offers both shocks and disturbing ideas."
2,Not the same scent,Product arrived on time but did not smell as the same when I tried it in the department store so I was very dissappointed with it.
2,Not her best,"I did not like this book as much as I did the first in the series for a couple of different reasons. The author repeatedly used a style of dramatic writing that subsequently became distracting. For example: ""[she felt]...agony. Agony and anxiety. Anxiety and accusation. Accusation and acrimony."" In addition, the inner spiritual conflicts the main characters experienced I found hard to understand. Even though the main plot was good, with a romance intertwined with a 'whodunnit', I struggled to finish this book."
2,Disappointingly incomplete,"I bought this dictionary to have handy while reading Willy Voet's book that alleges performance-enhancing drug use in European professional cycling. Voet's book, ""Massacre à la chane,"" presents two notable challenges. First, it contains some ten-dollar words. Second, it contains a variety of idioms and slang.Unfortunately, this dictionary proved virtually useless. When I didn't know a word or an expression, I rarely found it in the dictionary either. That proved true both for the unusual and the idiomatic or slang language.The dictionary is suitable for casual use by tourists who need a quick reference, or for beginning and intermediate students of French.Random House publishes an excellent Portuguese-English dictionary in the same series. It should be able to improve this one in the next edition."
4,Convenient and versatile but not perfect,"I was excited to get this lens and have the capability of zooming in close without having to switch lenses for wide angle shots. It does a good job, is very easy to operate, but I am a bit dissappointed with its ability to focus up close. It can not take pictures of objects closer than 6-8 feet. So I will still keep my 35-80 lens in my camera bag for those shots that I just can't back away from."
4,All in one,"Have recently purchased this lens for my Maxxum St si. The lens weighs much heavier than the Minolta 35-80mm lens which came with my camera but covers a much extended focal length range, possibly all that I would ever want to shoot within. The focusing rings turns as faster as the oneon the smaller lens did.Though the lens dwarfs the relatively smaller ST si camera body but the overall look of my camera is impressive. Hope the wide focal lenght coverage will equally have a premium optical quality."
4,POD has nothing to do with this album,"Just because POD makes hardcore music, doesn't mean they want to BE another hardcore band. I mean, POD and E-Town came up at about the same time. I'd dare say that POD was on the scene long before E-Town Concrete became what they were on Time2Shine. Heck, POD had released two full-lengths and 2 EPs by the time Time2Shine came out, and had been doing that music for several years priod to the Fundamental Elements of Southtown coming out.That said, The Second Coming is an awesome cd. My buddy used to listen to E-town constantly in the car, and I developed a taste for them. This album is by far their best."
5,Like a cross between Hatebreed and Eminem,"It's so sad that bands like e.town concrete go unrecognized when they are so much better than almost every band that is part of the rapcore scene. I've heard a lot of bands like that, but these guys just make all those bands look like nothing. It can go from being powerful hardcore songs to rapping interludes to funky, sort of jazzy intro's, and none of it ever sounds out of place. The diversity on this cd isn't something that you'll find anywhere, and what makes it so great is that it never sounds out of place because they play it so well. The vocals are great, going from a brutal hardcore voice to rapping that is right up there with the best of them. I highly recommend this to fans of hardcore, metal, rapcore, or people just looking for good music, because this is about as good as it gets. If you like this, check out Snot, their style was similar to these guys."
3,Boring and repetitive,"I have always been fascinated by Burma in all its aspects and I wanted to be more informed on the current political and social situations. The subject is certainly very interesting but I personally found the book itself very boring and repetitive: The concepts and ideas are repeated dozens of times in different chapters, over and over again. This book would have been much more powerful and appealing with 100 pages instead of 300."
4,"Glass Cut 4"" High Brillance Diamond Cut Glass Paper Weight","We purchased one Texas A&M and one Air Force as Christmas gifts. The quality of the paper weight is high quality however, the black padded presentation box is very low quality. I realize the weight is not suppsed to ""live"" in the box but it made what would be an otherwise high quality gift seem cheap when opened."
2,Needlessly wordy and long winded,"While O'Brien seems to really know his stuff, and the book covers a vast array of material, it's just too darn wordy. His sentence structure, and word usage are awkward. Many of the terms he uses are NEEDLESSLY large and difficult to understand. He uses terms like 'tactical planning', 'proactive and interactive', and the like with out even explaining what he means. Many of his sentences have fillers and are full of redundancies.The simple fact is that text books that are well written make learning the material easier. I implore the author to fix this book.This is a poorly written book that has a great deal of valuable knowledge."
5,MARCIA MULER AT HER BEST!,"IF YOU EVER ENJOYED A MARCIA MULLER BOOK, YOU'LL LOVE THIS ONE. IF YOU HAVE NEVER READ HER STORIES BEFORE, IF YOU AREN'T ON A FIRST NAME BASIS WITH SHARON, HER HEROINEP.I., THEN YOU MUST GET ACQUAINTED. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK TOSTART WITH. I'VE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED AND I DOUBT THAT YOU WILL BE EITHER. I BELIEVE MARCIA WAS THE FIRST TO CREATE A FEMALE P.I. I COULD BE WRONG, BUT I KNOW SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST. ENJOY!"
1,Make by high schoolers with a pocket camera,"The actors were stiff and seemed to stumble on their simple dialog. The five actors, a ""ghost"" and a shaky cameraman did little to add to the very weak story. Only the ending was worse than this high school performance."
2,not the one,When I first saw that this movie starred Michael O'Hare I thought it was the same actor who was on Babylon 5 as Commander Sinclair. However after going to IMDB.com I discovered that the actor in this movie is Michael O'Hare Wallace.
1,"Good, if you suffer from insomnia","If the American Gothic- esque cover isn't convincing enough, the tracks within this disk are boring enough to put Paul Bunyan to sleep. Lacks any ""spirit"" this CD claims to have."
2,"Great for weather updates, horrible for communication","I used brand new Duracell batteries with these radios, and the reception was still horrible. We had to repeat ourselves about 5 times for the other person to understand what we were saying. The only good (nay, excellent) thing about these radios is the weather updates. Perfect for camping, especially when you see flashes of light in the distance (turns out where we were camping had a severe thunderstorm watch, which turned to a warning while we were leaving at 2 AM). Possibly saved our lives, because the next day it was reported that someone else who was camping nearby got struck by lightning. However, there are other things available for that purpose. These things are junk for 2-way radios, but lifesavers for weather warnings."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money buying this kit. I bought it from another site on the internet. I bought it to make an ethernet cable for my boys' X-Box. It worked good on his cable. I made one more cable for a customer (I'm an electrical contractor), and it turned out fine. That was it!! I successfully made and tested 2 cables. After that, the crimper started destroying the ends, and as a result, the bad ends messed up the tester. I ended up buying a new crimper for over twice what this whole kit cost, and it's worth every penny. Also, the new crimper and ends that I bought were RJ45 EZ. With the EZ ends, the individual wires come out the front end of the connector so you can tell if you got them in the right order. The EZ crimper cuts off the excess wire as it is crimping. I will be purchasing a better tester, also."
4,Good tools,Was able to make a number of cables without any issue. The case is very flimsy so I replaced it. Overall very satisfied.
2,too much like watching Bart Simpson,"I received this DVD today and watched it with my 3yr. old. The information presented about bison, zebras, apes and monkeys, giraffes, and a couple of others is presented in a way that youngsters can understand, but I found the narrator, Billy Blue Hair, to be completely annoying. His voice and manner of speaking is way too similar to the ultimate brat, Bart Simpson. The animation is very much in the cartoon style, and the exclamations Billy uses include ""holy guacamole"", not an expression I'd like to hear my child repeat.Overall, this program was difficult for me to watch, and my 3 year old began fidgeting before the 30 minute show ended. We don't watch a lot of TV, but he has no trouble sitting through most half hour videos. If Amazon did not have a NO RETURN policy for DVD's, I'd return this one!"
1,"Can you say ""kho-ro-vats""?","Mediocre through and through.The only question in my mind was: ""How could someone like Serge Avedikian or Simon Abkarian sign up for this after reading the screenplay?!""Aside from being a complete artistic failure, this film has the potential to give the uninitiated viewer an absolutely idiotic notion of Armenia and Armenians. For this alone, the director should be shot using a gun of a particularly large caliber.The only watchable parts of the DVD are the deleted scenes without any dialogue."
1,Banal tripe. Jensen fans go elsewhere,"Enjoyed Jane Jensen's work, and discovered she was in this band. Thought I'd score some bonus early material.Wow. This is BAD. Lyrics (not hers) are banal enough any college creative writing program could better them in an hour seminar. Music is horrible synth-pop. And though Jensen is singing, it's often passed through dimestore filters and has none of the expressivity that makes her albums good listening. Not only is Blue completely different from anything she's done later, it's pitiful on its own merits. Very sophormoric, and that's being kind. Unlistenable is closer to the truth. Not a single track worth taking from this disc.I bought at $3 *with* shipping. I want my $3 back."
3,Okey for a low budget film,I liked this film. It has an interesting view on the subject of good and evil and shows a different perspective on the Adam and Eve myth. Some of the fight scenes are a bit graphic when two male characters lose an important body part. The cinematography is quite good for a B-movie
1,"Bizarre, Poor Everything","This feels like a joke honestly. This has the potential to be very interesting but the acting is awful, the cinematography is that of a child and there's not really a story line either. Don't waste your time here. It only goes downhill from the crappy city explosion within the first few minute."
3,Motorola Q9H leather pouch,The item arrived early than expected. There was some scratches on the back of the cellphone case. It it a reasonable price this cellphone leather pouch.
4,Fine,"A little tough to squeeze in the extended battery case, but all in all, it is fine and was definitely a bargian."
1,?,I never received this product. I was sent a hard plastic clip. i e-mailed you and was told you could do nothing about it.
3,Does its job,nothing special about this pouch. i dont like the plastic clip in the back. It was cheap and looks decent.
2,"Not for me, great for my son",I was dissatisfied with this product because it would not stay closed when used with my Moto Q phone. It does work for my son's blackberry. He loves it!
3,Not bad- Not good,"Pros- Leather is good quality. Good stitching. Good styling. Strong clip.Cons- Magnets in the flap are too weak. Flap itself is too flexible.If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy this case."
4,From Razr V3 case to Moto Q case,"I used to have a RAZR V3 and I bought an OEM case from Eforcity, I've used it for over a year and it still looks like brand new. Since I've changed my phone to Q, I got this OEM case from the same seller again. Fast shipping, nice product. Just never fail me ~*Like the smell of the leather case."
5,Great price and decent product,"Great price, way better than the cell phone stores. Product was received about 3 weeks ago. It has held up good. Still looks new. My husband uses it at work, so he has it on his belt all day. He said it feels secure and doesn't feel heavy. A lot of people said the magnetic clasp wasn't good but the way the phone stays in the case that doesn't matter much because the phone can't fall out anyways. Thanks."
3,"Motorola OEM horizonal fashion leather pouch (Black) with ""S"" clip for Motorola MOTO Q","Product looks good, but doesn't really hold up well over the long haul. It usually seperates from the clip with the leather seperating. but the price is good..you can order 3 for less than the price of one at the mall. Good enough."
2,Like Sheets in the Wind,"I dropped my Motorola into this pouch, and it was clearly too big for it. I'm guessing this is a generic pouch with an ""M"" on it."
1,Rather hear the alphabet recited,"I adore John McDermott's voice and have seen him in concert several times. He is undoubtedly one of the best singers of Irish and Scottish folk music in existance. I own all of his albums and was so excited to see this new one on Amazon. But I could not have been more disappointed. John's voice is as wonderful as ever, but these songs are not what his fans might want to hear from him. I would rather have heard him recite the alphabet then listen to this music. I played it once and will probably never listen to it again. I hope in the future he returns to the music that brought him to international attention."
2,"Too much commentary, not enough Tennyson","The readers for this audio recording performed satisfactorily. Derek Jacobi was particularly fine. However, there was too much narration between the poems. The commentators should have worked briefly, and before the poems, not between them.A poor choice for those who expect an uninterrupted stream of beautiful English poetry. We paid for an audio book of Tennyson, not stale controversy about him.For those interested in better recitations, try the Caedmon listings."
5,Best weather calendar out there,"I had the 2001 calendar and it is by far the best weather calendar available. Each day has a significant event in history, each month has a great picture, and inbetween the months there are articles and charts, etc.. If you know a weather geek, this is for him/her. Great gift idea for the skywarn'er in your family."
5,Why the name?,"(Porno) I like this short little movie. I don't really understand the title. The title makes it a b@$ch to find without bringing up all sorts of trash on my computer. It's about a teenage girl who seeks affection from boys in the entirely wrong way. She moves to a new apartment building and focuses on one particular, quiet boy. Interestingly, he's not that into her very forward approach. It makes you want a sequel to see how things might have developed between them. This was the only movie I was interested in watching in this compilation."
1,Vapour CD ??,"I've heard of vapourware (vaporware for cousins in the US) but is this vapour music?This CD is advertised on Amazon, supposedly published by La Cooka Ratcha, itself a part of the Voice Print company and is mysteriously unavailable. I have just had my Amazon order for it delayed for a second time and I wonder if it will ever materialise.Are they offering CDs for sale that do not exist? Why would anyone do that?"
3,An Alternative that packs easily,It's ok if a regular binocular is not available or you have little space to carry a standard set. Much harder to focus on any moving object so birding is out. Nice idea though.
1,Broken - This is Junk,"As soon as I took it out of the box, the eye piece separated from the rest of the device. The lens quality seems fine but it is useless if it falls apart so easily. Stay away from this product."
5,very nice scope,"This 6 x 30 monocular is an excellent scope for watching wildlife. Good light gathering ability in a moderate size package. Easy to use and seems to take the knocks of hiking well. I can't comment on waterproof ability, as I do all my hiking in the high desert. Pros- nice field of view, well-made, easy to use with glasses and fits your hand nicely. Cons- a big heavy, neck cord needs some softer cloth around it when hiking, only 6x power and the little plastic cap does not fit tightly on the eyepiece when rolled back for use with glasses. Overall very good optic for the price."
1,Handle with Care,"This monocular is the perfect size and magnification, but I broke mine the second time I took it out on my kayak. It handled getting splashed for a little while, but when it got slightly submerged it fogged up, (meaning water got inside). The fogging seemed confined to the eyepiece, and when I gently pried up the rubber around the eyepiece to find the source of the leak the entire eyepiece snapped off in my hand, and the lense dropped out! It looks like it was superglued on, and obviously that's where the water got in. I realize kayaks are a rough environment, and these weren't meant to be submerged, BUT anything advertised as water resistant should be able to handle a dunk or two in my opinion.In summation, this will work great for you..... if you don't ever drop it or get it wet.Edited to add: It appears Brunton will repair or replace this monocular for me! Excellent customer service!"
5,Very Helpful in so many ways.,"Thank you for this book. Figuratively, takes me home, as well as literally brings home my memories. I never knew how to spell the words until now! I even found the pretext to my name, which has not been said in over 30 or 40 years, maybe longer.....very much heartfelt thanks."
5,"Indispensable,,,","Somewhat dated, especially for computer related terms, but this little book has been well worth the $3.99 I paid for it 5 or 6 years ago. Almost every scientific discipline is addressed. Do yourself a favor - buy it."
4,Bible Study,Would have liked more exegesis and perhaps some concordance but did like presentation and translation.
1,I can't believe Doubleday approved this print job!,"I ordered my copy of the Jerusalem Bible over the objection of a previous reviewer who warned of a poor print job. Wow was he right! A 2 minute scan of the book reveals how miserable it would be to actually read it. Small font, light, uneven print. An abomination! It goes back today."
1,Pathetic printing,"The content of this edition may be wonderful, but the printing quality is like a bad xerox. what a pity that the publisher didn't purchase a quality job. I'm sending back the copy I received today. Ex-printer."
5,Truly a Love Letter,"This Bible is written from a very close and patient study of ancient texts, and shows just how much the Creator loves His children. Great for clearing up some 'confusing' texts that have been written in other translations."
2,I should have bought new,This was one of those used books that you look forward to receiving and then you receive to find it has an old musty smell. Then you have to start over
1,didn't like,"I really didn't like this product. I didn't like the layout of the book on the inside, hard to follow. I would not recommend this to others."
2,Disgraceful printing job!,"I had an original Jerusalem Bible from college back in the 70's and I loved it until somehow it went missing during a move. I was glad to see a version available that was true to the original text, although missing the reference notes that were so helpful.I was horrified however, at the printing quality. The publisher, Doubleday, should be ashamed. This is worse than a bad Xerox job, some places in the text blurring from the ink running! The paper is shamefully inadequate for a text as important as this.Be prepared, you will love the original text, but be sorely disappointed by the quality."
4,Most accrate rendition,I have been teaching The Tragedy of Julius Caesar for over 30 years and this BBS production is the best version available to show. Not one word has been omitted. The Hollywood versions are okay in a pinch but they lose some of the beauty of the language by editing for a movie audience. I'm glad that I bought this collection and hope that all the others included are as faithful as Caesar is.
3,Not as good as Zeferrelli,"BUT it was more complete than the 1968 version. And I will say, Alan Rickman's Tybalt was better than Michael York's. York is another one of those actors who makes a habit of chewing scenery, I much prefer Alan's more understated way of playing him. Not to mention, young Alan+tight costume=happy me!!!!"
5,Sweet!,"My wife and I used the configurations set in our closets and liked them so much that we decided to re-do our kitchen pantry with them.This piece went in the pantry. It has a firm plastic bottom, wire frame and canvas siding. It is being used to store wax paper, plastic wrap (the perfect height, by the way, to store these vertically), plastic baggie boxes, trash bag boxes and then some of our silicone bakeware in the ""extra"" space.It is big and spacious.If you purchase this in conjunction with the 3-shelf Configurations unit (the pine colored), it will stick out in relation to the 3-shelf unit. It is fine for us, as our pantry doors won't interfere with it, but it's close. The price you pay for the capacity, I guess.Could look better underneath that 3-shelf piece, but it's fine considering how much space it has.Anyhow, just wanted to tell you all that this thing is nice for kitchen pantry applications, too."
1,feeling ripped off,"I purchased this item and was not happy that there are only two tracks on the whole cd. There is no video or making of and wondered why it is listed as such. While I love the song, I was hoping there was more to the cd."
5,"Work fine, less expensive and ship to your house.","These filters are a more convenient and cheaper alternative to my local supplier. They work fine, basically it is a big wick, so it would be difficult for them not to work!"
5,Seller went out of his way to rectify mistake.,"Thia Aprilaire 45 Replacement Water Pad- Twin Pack [Misc.] that they describe on Amazon might not be what you receive. They describe the pads as 13.5"" X 10.5"". They also say it is a ""twin pack"" which, in actuality is two pads that are actually 7.5"" x 9.5"" each.When I put the two pads together I got 15"" X 9.5"". I cut the 15"" down to 13.5"", which I needed. I am short in the other direction. I need 10"" and have 9.5"".I am not happy with the way the vendor describes it versus what I actually received.UPDATE 2/17/2012After contacting seller concerning the above problem, they replied very quickly. Withing a few days i did get the correct item. The new pads fit perfectly.The seller was obviously concerned that the wrong item was sent and wanted to rectify the problem immediately. For this reason I am changing my 1 star to five."
5,Vivitar versus Canon,"I bought this lens to replace a Canon zoom lens I previously owned. This lens has made a world of difference in the quality of pictures I am able to produce. I am now planning on buying a new lens of a different power, and I definitely plan on it being a Vivitar."
5,great book!,"This book is not only good and witty sci. fi., it is also aparody of the American obsessiopn with consumer's society and endlesscommercials. How would you like to live in a society where great majority of people has brain implants who emit signals for example of being itchy when there is a commercial for spray to ease itching, and symptoms subside as soon as you order the spray etc."
5,Not just for Special Education!,"I am a special education teacher and this book is awesome! It is huge and has a TON of activities on writing words, sentences, and paragraphs. I got it along with ""Let's Write!"" by Cynthia M., M.Ed. Stowe, but if I had to choose one it would definitely be this one! This is the best book for a huge variety of writing practice pages that can easily be copied. This book makes writing so much easier for children! Don't think it can only be used for special education either! As a teacher, I have bought a lot of books to help me teach a variety of skills and this is easily in my top favorites!"
5,Wonderful Must-Have Resource,"This book is extremely well written, well organized, useful, and important. The exercises build on one another, beginning with practice with high-frequency words, all the way to independent writing. I am so happy I found this book for my student!!"
4,Works Well For Me!,I bought this for my guitar effects pedals that I wanted to ensure affixed to by gig bag and for this it does a pretty good enough job. I suppose it could be stronger at the side attached to the item as it does seem to come off some of my effects pedals more easily than others but I suppose the different surfaces account for this as well. I've since used this for other purposes like on my bathroom tile and it has held up well so far. I guess this does as advertised and so far is quite reliable for me. No real complaints.
3,"Works, but don't use on paint!!!","This sticks to pretty much anything, but just a word of warning - do not use on wall paint! I did, and was so happy with the product (since I live in an apartment and can't put nails in the walls), until I went to remove the product from the wall. It peeled off *all* of the wall paint underneath. Now I'm frantically scrambling to try to figure out a way to patch the paint (and will have to spend more $ to do so)"
3,"fine service, glue doesn't hold up to outside temps","Fast shipment of product, happy with vendor. Used this on an item outside in sunny, 80F weather. Glue bacame gummy and failed."
3,Not sticky enough,"The back is not sticky enough for my purposes. I bought industrial strength velcro before and should have gotten it again. If you're using it in a place where it might get a little damp or with fabric, it probably won't stick for very long. I'll get industrial strength again next time."
1,Slippery,"I'm disappointed with the strips. A few weeks use and they are coming off willy nilly endangering the scene and my attempted bath entry. Being a senior disabled citizen, I DO NOT recommend this product."
1,Junk,This velcro doesn't stick very good! I used it to put up a screen on my porch but it wouldn't hold the screen. The screen is very light made out of nylon or rayon. I had to use some strong twine to tie the velcro to the beam.
1,i guess its ok but cant be used outside,"i used this to hold the floor mats in place in my car unfortunately i didn't know the glue melted above 80 degrees and now the glue is stuck in my carpet and i barely got the Velcro strips off, it took lots of carpet with it when i pulled it up and left glue all over the floor mats and all over my hands when i pulled it off i thought these would be great and would last forever and i wouldn't have to take them up but because the glue started leaking out the Velcro and making everything sticky i had to get rid of it."
4,An improvement over previous versions,"Usually the adhesive used on the sticky back is weaker than the hook&loop so within a week or so your thing falls off with both sides of the velcro still attached. Not so with this stuff so far, I've hung smallish pictures, wireless thermometer displays, various small electronics devices and they've all held."
5,Exactly what you would expect.,"These strips are easy to peel and easy to cut with scissors. The adhesive is really strong. I'm using this item to hold Christmas candles on my windowsills.I worry a little that the adhesive might be so string that it will pull off paint if the strips are ever removed, but I don't think that's a detriment. These aren't being billed as ""paint safe."""
5,Works as intended,What can I say about Velcro? Our graphic artists use it in some of their projects and it works as it was meant to work. What more can you ask?
5,Velcro in a box,The one great thing about this Velcro is the adhesive on the back side. It sticks twice as well as other so I don't need extra surface to be sure the velcro adheres to whatever I apply it to.
5,Will the war ever end for the Thomases?,"In the fourth installment of the Children of the Promise series, Hughes takes us deeper into the wartime lives of Alex, Wally and Bobbi. Alex faces time as a prisoner, Wally continues in the unspeakable horror known as the Japanese P.O.W. camps and Bobbi struggles to keep her relationship with Richard alive as wounded soldiers pour in from the South Pacific theater. The reader is drawn so deeply into the lives of these characters they almost seem like family. Hughes, once again, has brilliantly triumphed in continuing to keep us so tuned in to the Thomases."
5,Really great!,"It would be hard to review just one of the books in the ""Children of the Promise"" series, what would one book be with out all of the others? The entire series is great! I really enjoyed reading it. It makes you think about a couple of the things that happend a little bit differently. I love great World War II books and I was proud to read and add ""When We Meet Again"" to my collection. If you love a series filled with suspence, romance, action, adventure and heart ache, then read this book, and the entire series for that matter!"
2,When We Meet Again (Children of the Promise) [Hardcover],This was a gift for my sister. I am so happy that it arrived during her visit with my family and we could share in her joy of recving this book to all to her collection.
3,insightful little book,"this little diary will give you some idea of life in the mid 1800's. it reads like the author was thirty some years old. Not a big contributor to the history of the period, it still worth a read if you are a Lee family admirer to begin with. It would have been a gold mine, if Agnes had continued through the war and after."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I guess I was not familiar with the term ""bead crochet"", but this book is not what I wanted. I was looking for books like ""Crochet with Wire""By: Nancie M. Wiseman and ""Crochet Jewelry"" By: Sophie Britten.This book covers Tubular crochet, and crochet that the beading looks more like Pave-studded fabric. Most of the projects look like somebody just tangled a hodge podge of beads together. Not one of the projects appeals to me--they all look very 'hippie' and outdated.I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before I bought this one."
5,Great Book!!,"I borrowed this book from our library and fell in love with it. I am very picky about the crafting books I choose to spend my money on, that is why I do the library thing first. I do agree that most of the projects are complicated, but it doesn't take long to work up to them. I just love this book and have plans to purchase it. If you are looking for more beginner patterns, try ""Simple Glass Beading"" by Dorothy Wood."
2,a certain level of competence in the medium is assumed,"I, unlike several other reviewers, really liked the look of the designs and the projects included in the book. However, I do agree that the instructions were overly simplified and not nearly informative enough to be a ""how to"" book.I've been soldiering through some of the projects, and I'm now back at Amazon looking for a better book to help me continue on."
3,Hoping practice makes perfect,"I suppose these are of good quality, but the actual task of using them on one's self is very challenging. There's nothing inherently different about this model of nipper that can change that."
2,"""Extended Cut"" is false advertising","I sprung for the extended cut, expecting to see some additional scenes or extra dialouge to flesh out the movie more. Sometimes these scenes are redundant or unimportant to the main plot but bring more depth to the characters, or are just interesting if you are a big fan of the original work (as I am).The extent of the ""extra footage"" for ""more movie"" are a few shots of gore during the burning church scene. Added absolutely nothing to the experience.Save your money and buy the single-disc version. Or, for the best experience just stick with the book."
3,Another okay sequal...,"To start off ""The Davinci Code"" was 3.75 stars this falls at 3.5 maybe even 3.25 stars. The biggest problem with this sequel is that the book it is based on is a prequel. While the movie decides to be a sequel, this screws up the 3rd act of the movie, with changing the time line of the movie the ending had to receive a Nip/Tuck to make it work with the rest of the movie. No complaints in the acting or directing all are spot on for an adult popcorn film. If you enjoyed the movie version of ""The Davinci Code"" you will more than likely enjoy yourself watching ""Angels and Demons"" though you will feel a little disappointed."
1,Digital Copy Code NOT VALID SINCE 3 DECEMBER 2010,"Although I enjoyed the movie (the real crux of this review, right?), for my collection I'm only trying to buy blu-rays that come with digital copies. I was disappointed when I received my A&D blu that the digital copy code HAD AN EXPIRATION DATE and it was already expired! I hadn't seen this before, but was thoroughly upset that something that is advertised to come with the movie had an expiration date? That is ridiculous. I'm pretty upset that Amazon didn't fully disclose on the discs page, I wouldn't have bought it then. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
2,Hanks and Howard at their worst.,"Initially I came away from the film thinking this is perhaps an apology for the concern the Church had over the first film. However, in my contemplation, I became awkwardly curious why all of this star power tainted themselves in a Porky's II attempt at duplicating a movie that had conclusion. Money is the only reason I can deduce. In the competitive Hollywood game of diving for pearls, Angels and Demons found empty shells."
2,pretty bad,"An unimaginative script, lots of running about but no real suspense. Cant find other words than ""boilerplate"" and ""boring"". Fake pretentious unimaginative drama. Like ""The Code."" i like history like the next guy but this...this, this was indigestible junk movie-food, unprofessional scriptwriting and film making.and awful casting. Hanks was totally off, the physicist character undeveloped. the cardinals weren't bad, tho'there was the beautiful backdrop of a virtual Vatican.music, by Hans Zimmer, was predictably good, probably the best part of the whole thing."
2,Don't buy Two-Disc Extended Edition,"Other reviewers have adequately commented on the motion picture itself. This review pertains to the so-called Two-Disc Extended Edition. While most two-disc editions provide the viewer with hours of additional features on the making the motion picture and the cast and crew, this edition provides the viewer with only three ten-minute featurettes, that easily could have been included on the feature disc, and about 20 ""previews"" for other motion pictures. At typically a 50% premium in price over the single-disc version, the three featurettes are not worth the price. Buy the single-disc version instead and enjoy the movie."
4,tom hanks,anothe great moviethe acting was great it was enjoyable to watch.to any tom hank fan this is one of his best
3,Wireless Camera,"First let me say I enjoyed this movie even though it has a glaring technical error regarding the wireless camera. There's a whole bunch of other technical silliness too that I won't go into.The video of the canister containing the anti-matter is broadcast using a wireless camera. This means that it transmits on a certain frequency. So that means there is a wireless receiver that 'captures' the video on the frequency being transmitted to be viewed by the vatican police. I am an electrical engineer have been involved in many, many, many wireless designs in the past and to my eyes it would be very easy to triangulate the location of the transmitter and find the canister very quickly. Or trace the video back to the receiver and go from there. Maybe there's some new technology that would prevent finding the transmitter that I'm not aware of.That being said, I put my engineer hat away when I watch this movie and just enjoy the ride."
3,Interesting Movie,"The DaVinci Code got me started so I bought Angels and Demons. Cant say I enjoyed it as much as the DaVinci Code but it was quite well done and good in its own way. Now I will be curious to see another one and hope they make a lot of them. There are many more they can do if someone knows what to do with the information. Try Angels and Demons, you might love it more than I did."
3,Movie Review,"I enjoyed the movie but wished it stayed closer to the novel. As the saying goes, the book is better than the movie. Still was worth watching"
4,a little of a let down,"it was no way as good as the 1st movie, but they really put in a good effort in trying."
5,Angels & Demons...and everything in between!,"What a powerful movie of international intrique, action and religious facts & lies, that, while truly controversal, is surely amazingly and entertainingly, extremely mesmerizing! When watching you must remember it's a work of fiction with theatrics that is peppered with some historical facts thrown in to intice the viewer. A work of genius, and movie you'll want to purchase. The director and actors are excellent and so believable in their rolls that are filled with suspence and action. I feel it's much better than The Da Vinci Code, although a it of a continuation of the ficitonal books but Dan Brown. Remember, Amazon has great sellers with great prices on used movies, too, so if you don't want to purchase it new, buy a used copy. Heck buy several for friends and family at the prices they can be purchased for!Carol in Virginia USA"
3,Book is better,"This is a decent movie, but the book is ten times better. Ron Howard took a lot of liberties with this movie. I just think the book is so much better than the movie."
3,Yawn!!!,This movie was a bit long but ok. Maybe I was not impressed with this movie because I read the book. Rent it first and add your own opion. I wish I had rented it first.
2,DVD,The price and packaging were great. As far as the movie..Well it's a personal opinion but I thought it was terrible.
2,cage vehicle,"This movie is so dumb it should have been a Nicholas Cage vehicle. It's got everything a brainless thriller should have: a ticking clock, double&triple crosses, murder and mayhem, a beautiful woman and a charismatic action hero: Tom Hanks?? Why did he do this? Saving Private Ryan, Apollo 13, Castaway, Joe vs the Volcano - now those are movies where Tom Hanks belongs and shines. But this is foolishness. I guess what with having done DaVinci Code (ridiculous, true, but a much better movie) and that they must have paid him 50bazillion dollars it shouldn't be a surprise, but I am disappointed. Actually, I'm not dissing Nicholas Cage's acting or charisma. But recently he just seems to pick one odd, silly movie to be in after another..."
5,Great movie!,This is an excellent blue-ray DVD. It is wonderful to watch on the hd tv. Definitely recommend.
2,No spanish subtitles?,"My rating is not because of the movie, I really, really liked the movie (I never read the book). It's incredible that with 40 GB of capacity in blu-ray discs the studios won't consider the spanish spoken customers and give them at least spanish subtitles. This Blu-ray disc, along with The Da Vinci Code (Extended Cut) and District 9 have the same problem.Every customer that buys a Blu-ray disc should receive ALL the possible information, extras, interviews, documentaries, trailers, EVERYTHING!!! about the movie that is buying (and that includes subtitles .... that's my opinion)."
1,Don't waste your time,"The main characters are egotistical, the story is totally implausible, and the script is focused on little more than stomping the Catholic Church. This film consists of a mis-match of boring clues followed by chases and running to the next boring clue.This is not my favorite movie. I dumped it after 45 minutes.Rent something else this time."
1,Terrible Movie,Maybe they should have read the book before they made the movie! The book is great but the movie doesn't hold true to the book at all and was very disappointing.
1,It's the British version and will not play in my DVD player. :-(,"This is a review on the purchase, not on the movie.Apparently I was not careful enough when ordering, and I picked on that was coming from the UK. I didn't think much of it, but when we tried to play it it will not play because of the ""coding"". Complete waste of money."
2,Book - Great! Movie - Bad!,"Another example of Book-Movie adaption gone completely wrong. I expect there to be some liberties taken, I am not naive. But, there were so many! As I watched I felt like, ""Did I read the book?"", because so many things that I thought were key in the novel had been changed. Hollywood needs to stop messing with good stories! I may think twice before I see another Book-Movie adaption."
2,terrible movie.,"this was a terrible movie. admittedly, i can't tell if my disdain comes from having read the book first or not.i don't even think this is worth renting for 3.99."
2,Nothing like the book,"As soon as I started watching this movie, I realized that it was nothing like the book. A huge team working on the antimatter project?? It was supposed to be a secret between Vittoria and her father. Oh wait, he's not her father, just her partner? Wow. It just got worse from there... Leaving out the director of CERN completely, having the fourth cardinal survive and become pope, making the hassassin out to be nothing more than a hitman, the list goes on and on. And what I thought was a main part of the storyline... The media aspect was also left out. It seemed like the whole point in the book was that the camerlengo was trying to get the word out about God, and he was using the media to do so. Anyway, all of that said, I suppose this could have been a good movie if you didn't read the book. I myself wish I had never bothered seeing the movie."
3,No extras worth mentioning. This is Blu-ray?,"Look for a movie review elsewhere. Personally, I thought the movie was 4/5 stars. No extras worth mentioning cost it another star, so I give it 3/5. What a waste of Blu-ray space. I've seen more extra content on DVDs."
3,Not as good as the book.,"Good movie, with plenty of action. I'm the read the book then watch the movie type of person, and unless its a Stephen King its probably not going to turn out well. I liked the movie, but was upset about some of the changes and parts left out in the movie. I know time constraints kind of forces you to make changes when creating a film adaptation, but there were some important details from the novel that was just left out. If you haven't read the book you're going to like the movie if you're interested by the story, if you read the book you might not like the movie."
5,Angels & Demons Review,"I LOVE this special 2-disc edition, though I just love the movie in general too. The action, the locations, how they got the locations, the details, the surprize plot twist, the music. All of it FIVE STARS!!!"
2,"Starts slow, and the pace is even slower","This is a very overrated movie that starts off slowly and continues with a slow pace throughout the movie. In fact, nothing happens for two hours, then it gets interesting in the last 15 minutes of the movie. Luckily, I didn't pay for the movie ticket when I saw the movie because it was a complete waste of 2 hours and some change, with the exception of the last 15 minutes. Perhaps its because this movie isn't my cup of tea.Keep in mind that a lot of people liked this movie, but I sure didn't."
2,OK Movie,"Just being about the vibe of the movie - I expected more after all the great reviews and the hype. It was just an ok movie. Not too boring, but not enough action and suspense. I just didn't get a feel of excitement from it."
2,What Happened?,"I loved the book, it had so many twists and turns. Then I watched the movie and it didn't follow the book at ALL. They didn't even put some of the main characters in the movie. Things just didn't line up. If I never read the book I might have liked the movie, but from the stand point of someone who thinks that a movie should follow the book as close as possible, this movie was a huge disappointment."
2,"If you like fiction, this is for you.","Brown has time and again attempted to pass the historical references in his stories as fact; however, once again we have a story from Brown that is full of historical inaccuracies. All you have to do is just a tiny bit of research to pick most of them out. So, if you like fictional stories that claim historical accuracy when they are not accurate at all, then this is for you."
1,Buller? Buller? Buller?,"This is a bunch of BULL! How can you explain leaving out THE MAIN VILLIAN OF THE BOOK!? That's like leaving out Lex Luthor of a Superman comic, Joker from Batman etc, how do you leave out the villian of the novel when it's the villian that has a vendetta with the church that's displayed in the movie!? The ""hashassin"" of the movie was just a sideshow character no where near the importance that's giving to him in the book, this movie was made strickly to please hollywood and the church."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this video as a ""USED - LIKE NEW"" video. To my surprise, when it arrived it was nothing but a copy of the original. If I wanted to buy an illegal copy I would have talked to my IT man at work."
2,Not in good condition,"Though the DVD plays fine, the inside of the case had what looks like pop spilled and dried in it and the outside of the case (and paper description) is damaged (paper torn, wrinkled and maybe rerolled flat to put back in plastic). I didn't even want to touch the case with a bare hand until I wiped it off with a clorox wipe!"
3,Nothing special,"Got to see it finally. This movie must have been made around the time National Treasure was made when driving around chasing clues was the thing in movies, only National Treasure was a better movie. Rent it, watch once and forget."
3,It was decent,Mildly entertaining thriller. I like the use of science. I like Tom Hanks too. It is based on a fictional novel by Dan Brown. It has nothing to do with the One true God and Jesus Christ so it wasn't really good at all.
2,not that into it,The blu ray played great. I'm not a blu ray fan. Have a lot of bad experiences with them not playing right. The movie is good. It has a good story to it. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy it. Special because it keeps your brain working.But it's not for me. I'm not a bright person and this movie puts me to sleep. I have this movie added to my collection because my husband likes it.
3,Talk about holding a grudge...,"While the faithful await the election of a new pope, symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and a beautiful physicist (Ayelet Zurer) follow the trail of the Illuminati, who have abducted the most likely papal candidates and threaten to destroy Vatican City in a blaze of anti-matter in retaliation for the persecution of Galileo and other scientists.This film features a few nail-biting scenes, so it is not as boring as its predecessor. However, it's still just a bit too neat the way Langdon is able to follow the trail of hidden clues and it's unclear why the villains would provide such clues in the first place. Oh, wait, that's right...without them, there would be no movie."
1,2 hours I'll never get back.,A real waste of time. The book was excellant and I could hardly put it down. I could hardly tell this was supposed to be based on the book. The worst movie I've seen since Showgirls way back when. If you would like a free copy of this movie look in my garbage can.
1,Read the book,If you've ever read the book. Please don't waste your time or money on this DVD. They changed the story dramatically it was not very good at all. I was very disappointed by the movie. I understand things need to be changed for film but they changed some very strange things that just ruined it!
2,Disapointing,"I read the book and this movie did not justice to it at all.I watched it with my wife, who had not read the book, and I had to pause every 5 minutes to explain for 10 minutes.It too rushed and took the beauty of the story away."
4,A great ending,"This is the follow up to the movie ""Da Vinci Code"". I actually think this was the better of the two. There are a few reasons that I think this one is better. First off Ewan McGregor is great. He plays a very good role in this movie. I also think Angels and Demons was less drawn out than the first film. A lot of people slam this movie for not following the book. I think that's a stupid thing to do, not to mention stuck up. Books and movies are totally different things. A great book is a great book. A great movie is a great movie. Angels and Demons is both. I recommend watching this movie and enjoying it for what it is. Try to be objective. No movie with Tom Hanks and Ewan McGregor in it has a remote possibility of being bad. You should definitely check this one out."
5,Angels & Demons,I was pleased with the rapid and accurate response to my order. It was delivered promptly.
2,Paint by numbers/cookie cutter - blow the main plot loser,"Not a complete disaster, but loses the dynamic feel of the book. Many of the details are changed including some major plot points and for no apparent reason other than to shorten the movie. The progression of the clues moves in a paint-by-numbers fashion. I was looking forward to the movie and had high expectations given the director and actors. Very dissapointed."
1,terrible,"It is not that often I feel my IQ level goes down after watching a movie, but I think we are talking at least 3 points here. This movie is utter crap."
3,Is there faith on earth?,The question unanswered in this movie is whether it was good for Christianity or not. (Roman Catholic especially} There was an inner battle going on relative to faith. The acting was superb. Is there anyone better than Tom Hanks?
5,Angels and Demons Blu Ray,"I bought Angels and Demons on Blu-Ray for my boyfriend for Christmas. He had waited patiently for it and wasn't disappointed. He's watched it 3 times now.Tom Hanks delivers a command performance just as he did in The Davinci Code.The total package has 3 disks. Theatrical Extended Editions, Special Features, anda Digital copy.You won't be disappointed."
3,Cool movie,"This movie is much like Da Vicni code, but there'[s enough differences to keep the two from being copies of one another. I haven't read Angels and Demons, but given how much I enjoyed Da Vinci Code, I should enjoy this book as well. The movie was very enjoyable - if you like Da Vinci Code, you should like this, though I thought Da Vinci Code was better."
3,Fast paced,"This film is clever just like the book. It just has so much to pack into the movie. You can't really get to know the characters as well. I liked the Vatican and the majesty of its architecture and its clergy. I would like to go there one day and tell my story. I love Italy. I loved Robert's quick mind, he is so intelligent and can put things together faster than a computer. It would be fun to put together clues and find the treasure or answer at the end or throughout. I recommend the Da Vinchi Code over this film yet it has a similiar thread just not as much of a find at the end, not as mysterious of a quest and not as rich with character development."
4,Wonderful Beginning,"The first ""Let Your Body Die"" on the Cyber-Tec Project in perhaps one of the best techno songs I've heard, with a few good tracks after it mixing Ambient with Hardcore, for a great combination. Just a little tip to you Cyber-Tec people out there, however, don't put for remixes of the same song on your debut album, it's just a bit tiresome."
5,GREAT deal for the money!,Great picture quality. Make sure to calibrate picture settings. Good ammount of inputs but a second component set would be nice.DON'T listen to people that say the picture looks stretched! No DUH! You don't even know how to set the aspect ratio correctly! RTFM before you list as a con!Overall this is an amazing deal for the money. Have the neighbor kid set it up for you if you technically challenge before you list a FEATURE as a CON!
2,Used tv,"I ordered this tv new. But when I opened the box, it did not look like spankin' new, was apparently used with finger print on the screen. Has anyone had this problem? I read on the internet about samsung repacking defective used items as new after fixing it. I'm returning mine not even for replacement but for refund."
3,"Great picture, speakers vibrate at times","This is an edit to my original review. I loved this TV but after only five years it occasionally goes black. I hear sound but no picture. It starts up ok and it's only gone black a few times a few days ago but started going black again today. I'm looking to repair it if it continues. I found a repair service with free diagnostic. If it's too expensive to fix, I'm looking at new TV's. They're much cheaper these days with more features but this one has a helluva lot of inputs!"
5,Samsung TV,"I spent about 2 months researching both Plasma and LCD TV's. I discovered this Samsung to be the best bang for the buck. I couldn't beat the Amazon price (free shipping and no sales tax). It was at least $300 cheaper than the same TV at Best Buy or CC. Once I ordered the TV it arrived via Eagle Shipping within about 1.5 weeks. I opened the box and discovered it had been dropped and one of the corners of the TV was chipped. I called both Amazon and Eagle and they immediately shipped a replacement (free of charge). I had to wait another week and a half but it arrived in excellent condition.The TV itselft is great. I don't have HD programming yet and won't for another 6 months or so. Regular programming is good and I can't imagine how good HD will eventually look. Easy to set up, very light. The sound is about average for any other TV I've ever had. DVD look outstanding.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this TV. You can't beat what you get for the price."
3,Our first big-screen,This is OK for the money. Doesn't do well for VHS. Sound volume changes unexpectedly when changing antennas.
5,Good Value LCD,I got the TV plug it in and it worked. Very easy to set up. The picture is good. You have to point the remote precisly (need the bottom of the TV) else everything is fine. I plug my laptop to it to play files and it worked just as well.
2,OK tv,"Just bought this one at BestBuy, will be returning it for the LNS4051, a much better TV, the pixelation on this 4041D even with component inputs is unbearable! Its like getting a tooth pulled every time the pixels appear during an action scene or a closeup, overall its just an ok tv,,for $1300 I think you should get more than ok and get the 4051, a much better samsung."
2,2.5 Years in and the problems start,"I have enjoyed this tv very much for the past couple years. The picture was very good, it interfaced with all my devices very quickly and easily. The sound wasn't the greatest, but acceptable for a set of tv speakers. The big problem is that the ir sensor on the front started becoming 'blind' last week. Meaning that the remote has to be within 12 inches of the tv in order for it to work."
4,Great TV,"I really like this TV.Good:The SD performance is good. The digital processor is top noch.The HD picture is as good as any.I'm satisfied with the contrast.There is a lot of input options.The HD tuner is pretty good. I'm only using a $3 rabbit ears and get all the major HD channels with solid signal strength (most transmitters are 20-30 miles away).Great price for a name brand.Amazon's delivery was fast and courteous.The not so good features are minor, but I'll list them incase it helps the reader decide:No QAM tuner.The remote/IR reciever is not great. There are times I push the buttons on the remote and the TV doesn't respond. You need to point the remote at the lower right corner of the tv for best response.Clunky menu navigation (function buttons on the remote help, though)Univ. Remote has no codes for DVRs (Tivo/ReplayTV)"
4,"My Samsung LNS4041D 40"" LCD HDTV",I have had this TV now for over three weeks. I have to say that I am very satisfied with the product. The TV was pretty much ready to go right out of the box. The colors are vibrant and the details are very sharp.I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a value buy that is of very high quality.
4,"Good TV, Small Annoyances","TV came delivered in good condition. Do not particularly like the time it takes flipping between screens (like a hotel TV 1-2 second delay), but will get used to it. Good quality product. Once I got the 43 inches(total size) up on the wall it looked larger than I envisioned. If I had the chance I may have gone with the 37"" instead. I did go in and make changes from the default - Contrast and brightness turned down. Also make sure the SRS TruSurround XT is set to Yes, the sound is considerably better."
1,TV has big problems,"Before you buy this TV go google ""Lns 4041dx takes forever to turn on"". I have had the tv for 2 years the quality of picture is good, sounds OK. The only complaint me and thousands of other people are having is that the conductors on the board go bad. Basically at some point can b a week after you buy it or 3 years the TV will stop turning on right away, it will take about 5 min, then a few weeks later 10 min then a week later 20min till it does not turn on its at all.. Now you can at this point pay Samsung 300+ dollars to fix it more then half the price of the tv, or you can fix it yourself if you do not mind pulling the board out of it and soldering a few new conductors on.. Any way its and epic fail on Samsung part, guess i should spend the extra money and get a Sony.."
2,3 years and it won't turn on anymore,"Like some other posters, the common Samsung problem started occuring recently where it took longer and longer to turn on. Yesterday this TV finally died and just makes clicking noises. Obviously warranty is out of the question, and having it fixed by a professional would almost cost as much as a new tv. Sad that most Samsungs seem to only last under 3 years based on a lot of research I've done regarding this problem on the internet."
2,Great TV but we got a lemon,"We bought this TV in October 2006. About 2 1/2 months ago, a line appeared on the screen and ""grew"" to the entire length of the TV. We called within that week we noticed it and have been given the run around ever since. The last promise from Samsung is someone will call us to schedule an appointment to replace it. If it weren't for the slow customer service, I would give the TV 5 stars. The reason we even gave it 2 stars is because it is a great picture (if you over look our ""line."")We expect the TV's we buy to last at least a couple of years!"
5,"Unbeatable Price, Great Quality",This is the best deal I found - $1100 + no tax + free shipping.The quality is excellent when viewing HD programming or a DVD movie.Highly recommended 5/5.
1,burned twice,"I bought this TV for a christmas present for my husband. After 4 days of use one of the speakers blew. We returned it and got a second one of the same make and model. We got 3 days out of this before wavy, amorphous colored shapes began to appear when we watched either DVD or TV. I know Samsung is supposed to make great LDC TVs, but I would steer away from this model based on our experience."
3,"""Not Bad Action Sequel!""","Bruce Willis, Justin Long and Timothy Olyphant star in this 2007 action sequel.Cop, John McClane and a computer hacker try to stop a criminal mastermind.This isn't bad, but it's not as good as the other films. This collector's editionnot only has nice picture and sound, but unrated & rated versions of thefilm plus some neat extras. I still recommend this."
5,"John Mcclain, always in the wrong place at the right time.","Bruce Willis' version of the action hero is always entertaining. He does what needs doing, throws in a great sense of humor and gets it done! What more could you ask for? Yippee Ki-Yay !"
4,Live free or die hard,Great movie new one in theaters not as good. Nnnnnnnnnnnnn n n n n n n n n n n n nbbnnbbbbbbbb
2,A Spoof of Itself,This movie could only be called a good movie if it was meant to be a parody of itself. Over the top action and special effects. Each scene sillier than the one before. Not worth the time or money.
1,movie died hard before viewing,"could not get the movie to play,play for 20 seconds,then froze up.repeated attempts.unable to watch the movie.i was very disappointed."
3,It's alright if you like these kind of movies.,"Live Free or Die Hard starring Bruce Willis is the 4th installment in the Die Hard franchise. The last film was 15 years ago and John is still a tough as nails cop. Justin Long is pretty good as well, nice comic relief, always liked him on the t.v. show Ed. The stunts are pretty outrageous (that's a good thing), and the plot is intense, great music as well. I am not a huge fan of action flicks but this one is pretty entertaining, Die Hard 2 is the best in the series but Live Free or Die Hard shall make your aderaline pump profusely, enjoy!"
4,Live Free or Die Hard,"I loved this movie, saw it at the theatre and enjoyed the fast paced action and the way the title character has not changed his attitude. The supporting cast were believable and the action sequences well filmed. Storyline was also fast paced and there was no down time at all it was like the others just go, go, go. Four stars from me."
1,OMG! This movie is SOOO Bad!,"2 hours of my life wasted. This is a terrible movie, who could have been saved if they didn't try hard to create absurd action scene, which are so dumb in their execution, they completely ruin the movie.Where do I start?Black helicopter loitering above DC, without being shot?FBI Swat team on their way for the rescue turning in circle above a harbor in a landlocked state?Building an office space in a elevated parking lot?The F35 scene is the DUMBEST action scene EVER!!!! I seriously was expecting the USM pilote to go after John with his knife once he ejected!The hot asian bad girl, getting hit by a ford expedition at 35 miles an hour, full frontal, but still surviving it? he legs were probably protected but the huge boots she was wearing....And the list goes on.....Avoid this movie like the pest, it is just bad.I feel sorry for bruce willis, He can do better than that...."
2,Although I did appreciate...,"... DH 1-2-3, I think this one will appeal only to those who regard TV crap as entertainment, and video games as the 'nec plus ultra' for what does not any longer deserves to be named ""civilization"". As well, the director's name must have been very badly mispelled, since it should not be ""Len Wiseman"", but ""Loose Dumbkid"". And, since they must have paid Bruce Willis over the top so they could use 'Die Hard' in the title, that would explain why they were not able to have any real actor in this pretence of a movie.Of course, all those with an IQ lower than 55 will disagree with that opinion."
4,Bruce Willis to the rescue,"Over the top, wonderful CGI but Bruce saves the day. This wouldn't have worked without him. Good quality sound and picture; liked having a choice between theatrical and unrated (mostly for the language)."
3,Good but not best of trilogy,I liked the movie with all the action.....But I liked the second movie the best.....I would rate the trilogy in this order.....213 two being the best of the three and 3 being the worst.....3 was good though....worth the purchase.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Die Hard movies are all about John McClane the everyman, so it's a bit surprising that this fourth installment decided to turn him into a superhero; when you couple that disjarring fact with the boring villain of Timothy Olyphant and general PG-13 lameness, this starts feeling less like a Die Hard movie and more like a mid-80s Schwarzenegger vehicle."
2,Bruce Willis sells out to homeland security?,Let's see if we can't give them more powerby making us even more afraid?A real action adventure with a point:you are in trouble without the computers controlling your life...
1,WARNING REGION A ONLY,"I am really peeved about this. I can't play it in my PS3. Region coding was abandoned years ago in dvd, what a stupid idea."
1,WORSE DIE HARD EVER,THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST OF THE DIE HARD SERIES. NO REAL ACTION AND IT WAS BORING.
3,Live Free or Die Hard,"This movie is silly fun. As always, Bruce Willis delivers a good performance. The film's sidekick, the ""Mac Guy"" from TV is also enjoyable to watch--the perfect nerd."
3,Did we really have to,"Was it really necessary to make this movie? I mean, you could've just rented, bought or re-watch the very first one because ""Live Free"" is a rehash of ""Die Hard"" down to the elevator shaft and the bad guys with foreign accents. Bruce Willis has sort of attained a super natural hero stamina and strength, sure he moans and groans when being pummelled but that's just for sound effects. Ironically he is what's impressive in this movie because he is aging well. You can obviously tell that he's an older gentleman but still gritty, handsome and he never lost that charming sneer in his smile. Sure the movie effects are visually stunning, the plot is so- so but, the bad guy wasn't bad enough. I think I am being generous by giving it three stars, it all goes to Bruce Willis. I recommend you watch the first one if you haven't seen it in a while or if you haven't seen ""Die Hard"" at all."
2,2.5 stars entertaining but ultimately a letdown.,"Live Free or Die HardAka Die Hard 42007** 1/2Headline: This is the WORST of the series and a utter letdown.I found this film a terrible letdown. The writing, the style and the feel were so different from the previous films. My gut feeling is that this story was slapped together and McClane was added into it.The story at times feels so utterly generic that its an embarrasment to be the diehard franchise.There is no wonderful mixing of energy (intensity, seriousness, subtle humor and over-the-top sequences). Die Hard 4 takes itself too seriously. It comes off as a CSI episode with McClane in it with a rare quip.So in the end this feels like a prewritten film with John McClane added afterwards. For that and the overly serious tone of the film make it a huge disappointment."
5,"Brings ""Die Hard"" Back In The Game!","Let's be honest... the first Die Hard is the best. The second and third movies left a lot to be desired, but this movie brings itself right behind the first!Willis' character has the same sarcastic crap talking as the first and is accompanied by Justin Long's quirky surprised/sarcastic comedy... an excellent balance. The action was great... maybe just a tiny bit overboard with the whole 18 wheeler/bridge scene, but none-the-less, still an excellent movie!"
3,Heads up: Only the DVD contains the Unrated Version,"Just a word of advice. This is a new 2013 Blu-ray / DVD combo set. Even though the description from Amazon said it is rated R, the movie itself on the Blu-ray is actually rated the theatrical PG-13 version. Only the DVD contains the unrated cut of the film so if you are looking for the Unrated Version on Blu-ray, you will not find it here. When I returned the disk to Amazon, I recommended that they should update the product description to avoid other customers from being confused as I was. As always, returning the product to Amazon was a straightforward procedure and they will refund most if not all of my return shipping fee."
3,"Lots of action, but not as good as the earlier ones.","Live Free or Die Hard has non-stop action, and well done stunts. But Bruce Willis is looking like a tired old cop, getting successively beat up escaping near death in the non-stop plots to kill him. If you are a fan of his earlier Die Hard movies, you will want to add this to your collection. If you have not seen his original Die Hard movie, that should be your first buy."
4,blu-ray review,"Not the best but far better than Die Harder.Video and Audio are very good.I don't care about the extra's, I just wantthe movie in the best way quality possible.This is not the best blu-ray release ever,but it is a very good one."
4,The watch,"The is a great movie, Bruce Willis doing a bang up job that he always does. The cast is outstanding like always, this is a Full review."
3,"you know what your getting, that is why you are there","LF or DH is a nice bookend to the series. john is sought to bring in a computer ace hacker because it seems other ""famous"" hackers are being killed off-also, the goverment system has been compromised. so, the bad guy is deliciously played by DEADWOODS-TIMMY OLYPHANT. he has the meaness, swagger and confindence to wreck the system since he made it. he was screwed over and now he is going to shut america down. interesting premise, excellent over the top special effects and performances. john's daughter is along for the ride and has several great key scenes. justin long is the ace hacker who helps ""outdated"" john mcclane understand the techie world. great action and enough entertainment to satisfy the viewer. if you liked the series then sit right down for a familiar friend-doing his job."
4,A worthy entry into the Die Hard series,"I must admit that I found myself a little bored at times, not to mention that some of the dialogue was pretty bad. I actually liked the movie more as it approached an hour or so into the mayhem. Bruce Willis did seem to be just going through the motions, especially early on, but he still had some clever lines and action scenes later in the film. Justin Long, as the helpless computer nerd, was much funnier than I thought he would be and really got the most laughs out of my packed theater.All in all, the PG-13 rating didn't hurt the violence one bit, but having John McClane not throw aroung the F word every few lines really felt out of place in a Die Hard movie. Even his famous line is muffled by a gunshot.Still worth seeing if you like mindless action, with a little humor thrown in for good measure.3.5 out of 5 stars"
5,Awesomeness !,"Huge Die Hard fan here, and I would suggest you get the blu-ray box set of all the die hard movies 1-4. I enjoyed this movie very much and this blu-ray should look amazing. The sound quality I expect 5/5.While Die Hard the first movie was a classic I was a little skeptic about Live Free Die Hard, but its an entertaining, smart and actioned packed movie from start to finish."
5,Keep McClane coming back!,"What a great treat! I always loved those Die Hard movies (in fact, it's dangerous for me to channel surf if one of them is on TV) and was thrilled when Live Free actually happened. The story, action, fx, acting, attitude are all there in spades. Some things are worth revisting when they're done well. This does not dissapoint. A reason to actually drag your tired [...] to the movies and pay to watch commercials!! Can't wait for the dvd."
3,"Good action movie, Unrated very different from Theatrical.","Of course, the Unrated version allowed John McClain to deliver his infamous ""Yipee Ki-yay, MF"" line, unlike the watered down theatrical version. However, there were other scenes that were very different as well. I think I liked the theatrical version better honestly! It was good for the action, and I loved the on-screen duo of the Mac guy (Justin Long) and Bruce Willis. Justin balanced out the over-the-top toughness of Willis and really made us laugh. Such a cutie.If you wanted to, you could poke all kinds of holes. And the fighter jet scene? Come on. But, it was certainly very entertaining and the helicopter scene was awesome."
4,entertaining,"Die Hard is keeping with the times! This high - tech Die Hard challenges John's well-known qualities, but he, of course, finds all responses. And naturally, finds them with a help of a partner, who like in Die Hard 3, is reluctant at the beginning, but helpful afterwards. The scene of the final fight, perhaps, ends too fast, but McClane again, in his usual manner demonstrates the imagination, that only a human being may ever have."
5,Die Hard Fan,"I loved this series from the beginning, and I'm so happy to see that this one didn't disappoint. It's a pure Bruce Willis action flick and it lives up the hype - take it all with a grain of salt as usual and enjoy. Yippe-ki-yay, indeed. Watch the unrated version if you want to hear him utter the classic foul mouthed line, though."
4,"AKA ""Die Hard 4.0"" and Beware of Motion Sickness!","Known in Australia as ""Die Hard 4.0"" this is an excellent movie and a worthy addition to the Die Hard series.But be warned - the same chimpanzee that threw the camera around wildly from time to time in The Bourne Ultimatum has been hired for some shots in this movie too. Sometimes the camera is jerking around so aimlessly that it may not only confuse your sense of what is happening story-wise, it may cause nausea and motion sickness. This is purely moments of crazy camera work that snuck by the editor (or looked cool on a tiny editing screen?) - the movie overall is great!"
2,Unbelievable,"This movie was ridiculous. Willis' character is more like Superman, Batman, Wolverine and The Hulk all rolled into one. He is inhuman and more like his character in Unbreakable than the origional character in Die Hard.The movie is so full of unbelievable action and stunts that it just seems like the director and writer were trying to take you on a roller coaster ride just for the the hell of it. The story is stupid and the dialogue is horrible.The could have called this Die Hard 4 Cannot Die So What Is The Point."
2,Don't buy Blu-Ray edition! NO UNRATED VERSION!,"Boy did I get screwed! Having previously enjoyed this film as a rental from Netflix in standard DVD form, I took advantage of a special ""buy 2 get one free"" offer from Amazon on selected Blu-Ray titles. It never occurred to me that Fox would put LESS on the Blu-Ray than the standard DVD edition. SHAME ON YOU FOX!!!!!!!"
2,Please!,"Bruce is back with his usual antics! It's a predictable plot for all us die hard junkies. But this time Bruce achieves super hero status as he accomplishes impossible and unbelieveable feats. Lauching an empty car to take out a helicopter that is 20 or thirty feet in the air? Please! I watched the movie all the way through, but went away with a feeling of time wasted. Oh well, guess I'll just wait for the next episode! Once a die hard junkie always a die hard junkie!"
2,DIE HARD TO BELIEVE,"Maybe Iam too picky, but should not a movie contain a resonable piece of pluasablity. Well Die Hard 4 contains none. It could be more believable if John McClane was depicted as a super hero from another planet,With indistructable super powers.It could be movies like this that encourage young people to fight each thinking no one will get seriously hurt, when in reality one punch could cause the death of another person as has happened many times here in Australia as iam sure it has in other parts of the world"
2,***BEWARE*** Region A Only...,"Though i still rate this as 2 Star for Amazon Super Saver Shipping and fast delivery. But the BD only works for Region A console. Though, i have bought a lot of BD at Amazon and this is the only BD and Fantastic Four were i can't watch this BD in my PS3. Attention message showing that this movie is encoded to Region A console. So you have been warned.Hans"
5,Stunts Galore and Willis Still in Character,"Nothing much to add to the trunk-full of reviews except that the stunts alone are worth the price of admission. Add to that a script that gives Willis the wherewithal to keep the character vital and you have a picture worth seeing. Of course, it is not the type of violence that seems real which makes it entertaining not frightening."
5,Great movie,"You should buy this, if you haven't seen the previous 3 it doesn't matter the story's aren't connected at all. 1 and 3 have a tiny connection but nothing you need to know about really."
5,Best Movie of Summer 2007!,Bruce Willis and Justin Long worked great together! This sequel over 12 years after Die Hard 3 is the best movie of them all!!!
5,Live Free or Die Hard,"Arrived on time, free shipping and significantly lower price that what the stores were charging around the holidays."
5,Live Free or Die Hard,"Excellent movie, Pure Action all the way through the movie. I really enjoyed this movie. Bruce still has the moves!"
4,not the best die hard but still a fun ride,Problem:Bruce needs a sidekick - just doesn't ring right - on the other hand great action sequences.
1,WORST OF DIEHARD,"The first in the series was pretty good. This, the last of the series, is the worst of the series. The film is really nothing but explosions with no plot. Don't waste your money/time on this dreadful dvd."
2,A few good action scenes but I fell through all the plot holes and got hurt.,OK...I watched the whole thing so it gets two stars. Avoid this movie like the plague. The story is highly contrived with unbelievable situations and 1 dimensional characters.
4,Great action movie,"This movie was everything I hoped it would be. Some movies I see the trailer and thats all that was good about the movie, but not this film. Hell, I saw it twice. The PG-13 rating kind of made me rethink seeing it but I did anyways. There was a couple behind me who wouldnt shut up all the way thru it, but I still enjoyed it. A few parts didnt really fit with the story, but im not a nerd who picks at those kinds of things. Its a great addition to the series. John may be older and swear less, but the action is really heavy and there are a few good laughs thrown in. The best action movie of the year so far and probably all year.I also want to predict something. When this movie comes out on dvd, it will probably be given the unrated edition. I honestly dont know what they could add to the movie, it was perfect the way it was."
4,Unrated version is overated if you have Hi-Def.,"I bought this Unrated version thinking there would be better fight/action sequences. But the only thing the unrated version gives you is more profanity (curse words). The action is still the same. So if you have Blu-Ray, I would buy that version instead, even if it is PG-13."
5,Gotta love Bruce!,"Ok, I know Bruce isn't getting any younger, but he will forever be sexy in my mind. I'm a huge fan of Die Hard and this movie did NOT dissapoint. I loved all the action and the story behind it. I was happy to find that the movie was less about his character's life and more about non-stop action and story-plot. A good watch!"
