3,L'Equip 101.5 Mimi Pulp ejector juicer,"I honestly can't tell the difference in the juice from this $100 juicer than from a $25 juicer I'd had for years before I bought it. Maybe my body can tell the difference, but my $25 glass of juice was as good as my $100 glass of it."
1,great doorstop,"The juicer would not power on so I sent it back to the manufacturer. When received back, I was able to use it perhaps ten times before it would not turn on.It's now decorating my garage floor."
4,Does the job,"Juicer is small and compact for my limited counter space. Easy to clean and assemble and makes short work of the fruits and vegetables. Pulp is a bit damp, but I don't think I am missing much juice. Overall a good little machine for a decent price."
5,Fantastic Juicer,"When this came out I bought it for $300. I got mine about 6 yrs. ago and its still running like its brand new! I find its a fantastic product, and I can't believe the price of it now! It's flu season and I have been using mine for the past 3 wks, and not sick yet. I often juice some fruit and then put it in a blender with berries/more fruit and it is fantastic stuff."
1,Company Lacking,"I ordered this item based upon several good reviews. It was not as advertised and obviously limited. I've tried to return the unused item. The company has delayed this process, offers no mailing label, charges for return postage and a 15 percent restocking fee on an unused item. I have been very dissatisfied with the product and the company behind the product. I caution anyone thinking about this product to buy elsewhere."
4,Unicorn killer book,Most of the times the book is better than the movie but in this case I think that the movie was better. I liked the parts of the book best that discussed Holly & also her relationship with Ira. Some of the parts of the book that discussed Ira's views & beliefs did not hold my interest all that much. Ira's views and beliefs are really out there.
5,Excellent,"Reviewers below think UNICORN'S SECRET was too tedious and didn't get to the point quickly enough. I disagree. The book is as much about the 60's as it is about Einhorn and Maddux. You need this background to understand the characters, especially Einhorn. You learn Einhorn's will to power actually played a more substantial role in his politics than any altruistic or ideological motivations.Einhorn was addicted to the leadership role, and let politics define who he was in a way that truly twisted his personality. We see this over and over again, even today, in such movements as the Christian Coalition, and Leonora Fulani's ""social therapy.""UNICORN'S SECRET, along with David Harris' DREAMS DIE HARD (about another tragic murder of a 60's radical) help more fully define the decade for history."
5,Fascinating story,"This is a gripping story, made all the more tragic because Einhorn remains free in France. It paints the picture of why liberal activists are so often not benevolent, but selfish, sometimes psychopathic. People with huge egos like to pat themselves on the back, which is what fuels their activism: selfishness NOT selflessness is what so often fuels the public liberal. Einhorn is a (very) extreme example of that. Sometimes the scum, and not the cream, rises to the top (as Einhorn did for a time). France should be ashamed of themselves for harboring him. To read more about psychopaths (of which Einhorn almost certainly is) read the nonfiction WITHOUT CONSCIENCE. Reading that book will help you spot true evil before it happens. Maybe Holly would be alive today if she'd had that book."
5,Excellent,"Just to mention this...The songs on this CD are not 160+ BPM as one of my fellow reviewers pointed out... 160BPM is extremely fast and falls under the category of underground-industrial-techno.TranzWorld however, is a mixture of 120-140BPM songs of euro-techno, euro-trance, eurogressive and euro-house tracks... What makes this compilation great is the origin of the tracks...If you've noticed, all the tracks are European... compared to the U.S. freestyle/club junk, of course it is amazing...my point is, even though Webster Hall has managed to get some great stuff on the disc, some tracks just don't cut it as the best from Europe.Probably the best song on this compilation is YOU AND I by GRIFFEN, which is track #1."
1,There's lots of echo but where's Charlotte ??????,"This DVD is simply a big disappointment. You don't have to read any more.Sony Classical worked hard to make sure Charlotte Church only sings two songs even though they promote her name heavily with this DVD.Sony Classical also worked hard to put in as much echo as possible. No doubt because Vanessa Williams and Tony Bennett need all the help they can get. That echo spoils the little singing that Charlotte does and it spoils all of Placido's singing. Maybe Sony Classical thinks that this sound track should be played with heavy echo on $... boom boxes.What a great missed opportunity for Sony Classical to have Placido Domingo and Charlotte Church sing a few christmas carols together on a DVD without distortion.There's obviously a lot of reasons why this DVD is now being heavily discounted. Sadly, it's just a big rip off."
1,mercy!,"What a travesty, the great Domingo soldiers on with a group of motley artists (Charlotte excepted). I mean, Tony Bennett should retire and enjoy his millions, he is REALLY past it! It was painful to watch him and Placido mangle beautiful Christmas music and it would have offended the ears of The Creator.Charlotte however, is showing more maturity in her singing.The other female pop star lacked diction, and was clearly out of her depth.These annual Christmas in Vienna shows have been really tacky over the last few years.......check out 'Christmas Glory at Westminster Abbey', the BBC will show how it is supposed to be done."
1,"I LOVE CHRISTMAS, BUT NOT THIS COLD CONCERT CATASTROPHE!","Each individual element of this event had potential of providing a warm and memorable Christmas evening, but together they are lost in a blinding snowstorm. As much as I love Christmas, its music and all things wonderful about it... this video does not deliver!"
1,Hands of Bloo,"Imagine what's basically a home movie from the late sixties, starring your untalented friends, no sense of editing or sound quality, and you've pretty much got it.The story is plodding, but not as perverse as the production values.I should probably give this movie more than one star for the unintentional humor it provides, but my Blood, it sure is BAD in every sense of the word."
1,Amazon doubled the price!,"I have always known Amazon to have fair pricing but not on this order! They doubled the Costco prices on every Kirkland brand of vitamin I bought. No, I didn't check ahead, but never again. Bad Amazon!"
3,"Good selection, lots of errors","The words selected were relevant and commonplace on the GRE. However, in the practice tests there are many errors. In addition, several of the definitions are not as precise as in other books. A good book to start with, but supplement it with something more academic."
4,Loved it!,"This book is fabulous! I really enjoyed reading it! Thank you, Cristina Ferrare, for such a great read."
1,I Used to Be a Fan,"I used to be a fan of Christina Ferrare until I read this book. Besides being totally self-indulgent, the main objective appears to be a hook to launch her jewelry line."
1,Robertson is a bigot!!!,"Pat Robertson is a bigot who attacks other religions and hates the poor. He is not totally pro-life because he says that abortion is okay in case of rape and incest. Less than 1/10 of 1% of abortions are because of rape and incest. It is not the child's fault being conceived out of sin.Save the Baby Human,Joy Marie Murphy"
5,Crazy In Love,"This DVD has Beyoncé's video for ""Crazy In Love"" and the making of the album, ""Dangerously In Love"", You see Beyoncé recording some of her songs in the studio and she talks about each song on the album. This DVD is definatley worth you 8 bucks...you get to see Miss Beautiful Beyoncé..."
3,an obsolete translation of an incomparable book,"John Beevers, a British layman, had a great love for St. Therese and introduced countless people to her and through two other books about her. His translation has been superseded by the translation of Father John Clarke, OCD, who worked directly from the original manuscripts and produced a translation for ICS Publications which has gone into three editions. That text is universally acknowledged as the authoritative English translation, and I would like to see all new readers start with it. We appreciate the Beevers translation as an important historical work in the rise of the cult of St. Therese."
5,Very moving,I never thought a book about a saint would be so enjoyable. Saint Therese is an inspiration to everyone! She shows in this work that she was also a human with faults as well. I highly recommend this little book.
5,Lovely,"Soooo loved reading this book. Enjoyed reading about herwonderful life, and what a great Saint she is. Wouldhighly recommend it to anyone interested."
5,"""Story of a Soul""...St. Therese of Lesieux This book is an outstanding source of spiritual teaching.","An outstanding souce of spirituality teaching, meant for any christian seeking a deeper knowledge and understanding of their relationship with God.St. Therese kept this diary at the instruction of her superiors, and in it outlines her ""little way' to spiritual happiness. Briefly, her ""little way"" is doing small things with great love to please Jesus.This will be my fourth reading!"
4,Overall a Decent Panda,"In reguards to the review saying that the ""face"" is nice. I definatly did not feel that this was true. I am going to upload a picture of hte face, the display panda is definatly a much cuter panda. As for quality, it is very good. Has a bean bag bottom, however I have a girlfriend that cares about how her stuffed animals look (face wise) and this panda simply isnt up the pretty spec. IT SEEMS mass produced, overall I wouldnt recommend it based on the picture.PROSQualityNice TagsQuality bag it came inCONSQuestionable Ugly FaceWhat brand is it?Sheds like crazy, have white/black all over me after opening it"
5,Panda causes much happiness,"I have a friend who, after watching a special on television about Pandas, fell in love with the gentle creatures. She was so passionate about the Panda. I saw this baby Panda bear and sent for it so I could surprise her. The little bear has an adorable face and is wonderful to hug. I did, indeed surprise my friend. She holds it every day and loves having it. I am happy such a small token could bring so much happiness."
1,Bad Build Quality,"I bought this toy along with the Toy Maltese Plush. The quality is terrible--the seams are uneven, the legs are of uneven length, the eyes are crossed, the blacks around the eyes are of completely different shapes. It looks like they took all of 10 seconds to cut and show up this toy. All in all, this toy has completely lost its initial appeal, its cuteness. I am ashamed of giving this as present because of how suicidal this panda looks. I will never purchase from Aurora again, because they seem to have stopped caring about quality that they used to produce."
3,Smaller than expected,"The bear itself is nice; it's just MUCH smaller than anticipated. As with the other stuffed animal I purchased, this one must be measured from the end of the feet to the top of the head because it is NOT 12"" sitting down. Cute anyway!"
4,A good purchase,I got this gift for my girlfriend as she loves Pandas. The toy's quality is really nice and looks pretty durable as well. It was a good purchase and would recommend this toy for others to purchase as well.
5,Best Panda!,I love this Panda. It kept me warm and loving . I don't have enough words to say he is so adorableand so cozy and loving. This is my second one btw.I love it!!!!
3,Not as it seems,"Well, first of all the panda isn't AS cute as it looks, it's face is a little messed up. It's noes isn't quite right, and its face is oddly shaped. It is very fluffy though, really nice fur. It's just it's face that is a little messed up."
5,My teenage daughter loves it,"She's big into the Asian culture and loves panda's. It's the perfect size for her to cuddle with. The texture borders on faux fur, very soft to the touch. Body is also the right amount of squishy. Facial characteristics are quite accurate."
4,A little too big for 2 year old,"Got this for my daughter. She had a smaller one that she takes everywhere. This one is bigger and heavier, a bit too much for 2 year old"
5,Sweet gift for young panda lovers.,"Purchased this for my Goddaughter after buying the ""beannie baby"" version. Both were appreciated for their attributes, but this one seemed much more plush (and huggable due to it's large size, of course). The quality and value appear to set this above most other stuffed bears I've seen. Now she's set... one for the road and one to snuggle in bed. But, I seriously doubt that will suffice for long."
3,not so cute panda,"definitely not as chubby and cute as it looks in this display image. Looked more like a expressionless,dead, stuffed panda. absolutely no sign of life... as opposed to the live n kickin pug marketed by the same manufacturer Aurora."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!!!,"I purchased 22 mostly different stuffed zoo animals for the kindergarten class I have adopted, as they are going to the zoo this next week. These animals were to be their reward for being good at the Zoo.This toy is advertised as being 10"" tall. I just measured it and it is EXACTLY 8 "" tall! I couldn't BELIEVE how SMALL these animals are!! The WORST thing is that I ordered animals from other companies and they ARE about 10"" tall - so NOW I am left scrambling to buy NEW animals that really ARE 10"" so that some children do not feel slighted over getting little, tiny animals!Granted, this animal did not cost a great deal. But when Amazon ADVERTISES the animals as being 10"" - I fully EXPECT them to be this size!!!"
4,Not like the picture but still VERY Good,"I got this for my friend's 2 yr old. First, it didn't look as cute as in the picture, but definitely better than any other that I have seen..Very soft, not sure how durable it would be. The size is perfect, not too small, not oo big for a 2yr old. Overall, I think its a very good buy.."
2,Ugly toy,"It looks so cute here, it looks so horrible in real life. Its mushed up face isnt cute at all"
1,Not life like!,I got this toy for my little girl and at first she loved it! However she began to obsess over the toy in a way I never knew a three year old could about anything. As you see my family lives in china so i decided to venture into the wilderness with my little girl to find a panda thinking they were as small an adorable as this. I searched nearly for three days until I found a panda. My...my little girl ran to it was just like the toy but then...A much larger bear struck her and she's now in intensive care I hope the company who builds these pay for the medical bills my god the horror they put children through!
5,Very cute little Panda,"This was a great purchase, she loves it and it's her constant companion. Very soft and well made, as cute as it looks in the pictures. It's also a good size to be carried around."
4,Makes a great gift!,"When my sister-in-law was planning to get married, I wanted to get her a gift that she could keep and refer to throughout her future. We come from a large Hispanic family, so when I saw this book I was impressed. It made a cute gift and she was really excited to have gotten it. It goes thru all the different Mexican-themed holidays, offering history and ways to celebrate. Once she has kids, I know they will like it too!"
4,Buddha And The Chocolate Box,Thank you - Buddha And The Chocolate Box safely received in good condition. Lovely to hear it again.
3,no wonder it got cancelled,this season is depressing and proves what gene has been saying about women. Shannon has become a everything he said women were and is proving his point for him I see a bad break up coming. I also feel sorry for his kids.
2,Vintage Rockabilly,"Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks were probably one of the better bar bands of the early and mid-sixties. The music is ""night club"" sixties style ""rockabilly"" through and through. Ironically, this band evolved into ""The Band"" with Levon Helm, Rick Danko, and ""Robbie"" Roberson as the most prominent survivors. If you into this style and era it brings back a lot of memories. However, the quality of the recording and music selections leave a lot to be desired."
5,An Irishman By Now,"Fabulous book . . . very well written! I am hoping that a book 2 is in the wings. I could have read on and on. As it was, I read it, or perhaps more accurately -- devoured it from cover to cover in one day. Please, please, please write another book.An Irishman by Now: An American Boy's Tale of Passion and Discovery in Rural Ireland"
3,The SAME Keith Bryant.....,"Yep, folks, it's the same Keith Bryant who does the song ""Ridin' With The Legend"". Only place I've found that release, so far, is from the record company Lofton Creek Records, website is www.loftoncreekrecords.com Hope this helps those who are looking."
4,Useful and stylish potholders,"This potholder was the perfect color for my kitchen; soft pumpkin orange, is how I would describe it. Not an easy color to find. It goes beautifully with Mario Batali's stiped oven mitt and oversized kitchen towels. It is nicely made and not apt to fall apart on you but it could be a bit thicker. I suggest NOT inserting your hand but rather using it as you would most potholders and folding it over the handle. Folded over it gives plenty of protection."
4,"Cute, durable","These potholders are very hip and fit nicely in any decor. Not incredibly heat resistant, so may need to double up for super-hot pans."
4,good mit!,I have trouble finding thick pot holders... this is a good one (when used as a pot holder not a mit).
5,Great Arranging Resource!,"This book has lots of ideas: both written out and as audio examples. It begins teaching a very basic music theory lesson. It then goes through many different arranging topics, which include style, syllables, harmonies, rhythmic techniques, vocal jazz, and much more! I bought a copy for myself and I plan on buying one for my college a cappella group (College of Wooster's ""A Round of Monkeys"") as well. Definitely worth the money!"
5,Excellent Teleconverter,I bought this teleconverter initially to use on with my Sigma 70-200/2.8 EX DG HSM lens and it worked very well. I subsequently bought a Sigma 300mm/2.8 prime. Again the TC worked great. Autofocus is fast and image quality is very good if not great. This TC only works with Sigma lenses and TC are not recommended for slow lenses. By slow I mean anything slower than f4. Anything slower and your autofocus is not likely to work due to insufficient light. Used appropriately this is a great product at a great price.
1,Sigma 2.0X Teleconverter,"Although the teleconverter fit on my Nikon camera, my Nikon compatable lenses would not fit on the teleconverter, thereby rendering it nonfunctional."
4,Fifty Years in Siletz Timber,Exactly what I wanted and paid a fair price for a bit of history. The item was received in a timely manner.
2,Weird Interpretation,"This was a rather novel setting for the opera in an English school. While the singing was very good, as well as the acting, the interpretation is weird. I prefer a more traditional production. It seems arrogant on the part of opera producers to reject tradition in favor of their own fads. If you look at the box cover, it appears traditional. But, you will not get tradition. You get a sorceress who is some type of sex freak with punk-mod girls as her assistance.Traditional opera setting as required by the composer provides us with real insight into the past and the composer's mind. A really good traditional production can complement our understanding of some of the great CD recordings."
4,Great recipes,"This book is extraordinary for the innovative takes on old favorites (e.g., greek pastries). I was drawn to this book because of its particular konafa (aka kataifi) recipe which I had been searching for many years, and it was delicious. I also attempted her baklava (not to my taste only b/c I didn't like the orange flower water). I am giving it 4 stars however, because the author does stretch the concept of ""mediterranean"" a bit. This doesn't detract from the tastiness of the recipes she offers, however."
5,"Guilt, Sin, Temptation","Description: After an illicit affair with a college coed, Professor Dennis Burke(Peter Coyote) is forced to accept a post at another university. Alone in his apartment, Dennis discovers a collection of erotic letters. Intrigued, he responds and soon finds himself seduced by Lydia(Nastassja Kinski), an escaped murderer, framed by a jilted lover(Udo Kier), Now, Denise must outwit a relentless detective(Ernie Hudson), and a suspicious student(Fairuza Balk) and determine what to trust - his emotions or the evidence.Starring: Peter Coyote, Natassja Kinski, Fairuza Balk, Jeremy Piven, Ernie Hudson, Paul Gleason, Udo KierSpecial Features: Spanish Subtitles/Subtitulos en EspanolGenre: Suspense/ThrillerRating: R (Strong Language, Sexual Dialogue, Some NudityRelease Date: 2001Label: Paramount Home VideoDirector: Bradley Battersby"
2,Mostly a waste of talent,"Unfotunately, the talents of the cast are ill used. The story trys to be clever and sexually titallating, but mostly is just silly. The characters never seem real and the story less so. I am a big fan of both Ms. Kinski and Balk and wasting their talents in this tawdry thriller was very disappointing."
3,"Good for continents, not detail",The book is like the size of a small workbook. I was sketching the world using it and it allowed for a focused look at small parts of the world at the same time. All the projections are different however and some portions of northern Europe and the pacific islands are lacking. Good overall but if you are looking for details about specific places you might have trouble.
4,Ronnie Hawkins,"The subject matter usually makes the book. This one has the subject matter, however the presentation could have been better. Could build and flow bettter."
5,Useful Addition to an already great gun!,"I am a big fan of Soviet-Pattern Weapons, as an SKS being one of them and the cornerstone of my collection, I decided to upgrade it and buy some parts. I came across this ""Recoil Buffer"" and decided to buy it. I am very happy with the quality of the construction and I know that this part will give many years of faithful service."
2,change my mind,"thought i might need it until i talk to the right people,a correctly SKS operating gun doesnt need it. if ur guns banging that bad. change the spring."
3,SKS Buffer,"While this is a item that should be required for all SKS rifles, shop around to find the best price & watch out for the mark up on shipping. ""I Love My Glock"" charged $9.95 for this item which is way too high priced & the shipping of almost $7.00 is a rip-off."
4,A must if you own a SKS ...,A must if you own a SKS. It helps to reduce the recoil and is a must if you are using a scope. Super easy to install.
3,May cause feeding problems,"It does a bit bit to soften the recoil. Not too much, but noticeable. However, I had a couple feeding problems with it. This was with both wolf, and yugo surplus. Its not horrendous though, its around 3-4 failures per 100 rounds, so its not regular enough to be a problem, but as soon as I took it off, it went back to 100% reliability. I think the muzzle brake takes far more bite out of a recoil, though, so I ended up going with that instead."
2,not needed,i bought this cuz i thought it would save on my parts. well i dont think it really will after testing. the sks was designed to run without it and does so very well.. i dont believe this product is neccesarry to help your parts last longer.
3,caused feeding problems with light loads,"While it does do what it claims (reduces recoil, protects receiver, protects scope), I experienced about a 20% failure to feed rate while using this item. This was with baurnal golden bear ammo, I think some hotter loads most likely would not have these problems.If the buffer was not so thick I think this problem may not have happened, but the life of the buffer would most likely be reduced. I may try removing a few coils from the recoil spring so I can continue to use this buffer.Overall a good product, just be sure to thoroughly test your rifle after installation."
2,carpform,"did not fit and after reading several reviews decided not to install, these guns are made to shoot over 1 mill. rounds without flaw, forget it and save your money"
3,snug but works well,I had to take a lighter to it to get it to fit right and snug down into carrier. But Once it got in there with another bit of heating it slid snug and fit. Looking forward to seeing if it makes a difference at all in the performance.
2,Not really worth it... but hey did deliver early!,"For what it really is, not worth 5 dollars.. didn't notice any difference. Cheap looking little piece of plastic that, to me, should be somewhat rubberized but no, just a little 10 cent little piece of plastic..... no thanks. Not even worth returning!"
4,G,"I Liked This product. The only reason, and possibly a bad reason I gave it a four is because there's still obvious recoil. but this is a great product for Sks's with scopes that tend to go into your eye every time you fire. Good product."
3,SKS recoil buffer,"Installation very easy. Have not tested it further. Expected it to be softer, but it should last a long time."
5,How British Cops Handle Insanity Redux,"The fictional county of Midsomer still has murder rates per capita are higher than Chicago, Detroit, and New Orleans combined. However, Barnaby is now joined by a new sidekick, Detective Constable Ben Jones (Jason Hughes). Ben Jones will eventually earn a detective Sargent rank - but not yet. :-)The pluses for this set are: this is still fiction, the scenery is still much better, there remains lot of tongue-in-cheek British humor, and John Nettles - an excellent actor and humorist. Jane Wymark, as Barnaby's wife, continues her great support role along with Laura Howard and Ben Jones.If you like multiple who-dun-its woven within one story, the series is for you. Since PBS stopped airing the series, my wife and I have a weekly Hercule Poirot/Midsomer Murders night every Sunday."
5,Better as they go,Every time i receive a new series I seem to enjoy it more than the one before. Great acting and always a good story line.Shirley
4,Young John Nettles,"Any American viewers taken with John Nettles might care to see him in the tv crime series that established him as a household name in the UK. The series was called Bergerac(after the character played by John) and is set on the charming island of Jersey(which is part of the UK, but is in fact close to Brittany in France). Dvds of the series are available on Amazon.co.uk. You could a taster by checking out clips on Youtube."
5,Great Series,"We have every series that have so far been released. We have even been tempted to buy from Amazon.co.uk, but we cannot play the uk dvd's on our machine. Love this series."
5,Set 11 Midsomers Murders,"I have all 11 sets and I love them. I am a retired Police officer of 27 years, If you like murder mysters you'll love it."
4,murder in florida,"Midsomer Murders Set 11I have watched all of the Midsomer Murders and love them all. I was dissapointed, however, in ""Down Among the Dead Men"", there was only 1 murder! What's with that? There are always many plot twists and turns with Inspector Barnaby and so many villagers getting knocked off that you begin to wonder how much of the village can be left! It is always interesting to try to figure out who did it in these mysteries, but i had to wonder if they brought in a ghost writer, it just was not totally up to Barnaby."
2,Time lag a concern.,I have generally found this series well presented however I am losing faith with the length of time it is taking from air date to DVD release. With the new series now 3-4 years in front of the DVD release and the show destined for termination (apparently)I am going to wait until the whole series is released as a box set (which will be cheaper and probably quicker than waiting for this DVD series to be released!)
3,Nice but hard to assemble...,Definately requires two person assembly. If possible purchase better screws (the ones included bent and stripped pretty easily). Otherwise they are nice once together. We got these for a very low price over the holidays and feel like we got a great deal (we actually bought two) but would not have paid full price for them. Overall they are good quality. My only gripe with the finished product is that the screws are black and they really stand out from the beautiful colors of the shelves. I will be painting the screws or covering them with stickers.
4,Fun stocking - a little skinny,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas as he needed a new stocking and wanted something unique. This definitely fit the bill. My only complaint is the size. The ankle/foot area is very narrow. I could maybe put some golf balls in the foot/ankle area, but that's about it. We're definitely going to keep and use the stocking, but in order to give it 5 stars, it would need to be wider. Note, the length of the stocking is as long as a traditional stocking so it looks nice hanging next to other stockings. (As nice as a woman's fish net leg can...)"
4,good produt,This product sound more like duck instead of squirrels but I will try when squirrels season comes again next year to see if which one works the better.
4,Im just a beginner,"So far so good, I get the critters attention, and I am still working on the effects. Best place for testing how critters react is at boat landing where lots of animals are present."
3,crappy gun..... good memories,This was my first airsoft gun I bought it a a hobby shop in rochester n.y.called video game monster(good store) but it was very week 120 fps (i clocked it) for the month and a half I had it it was the funnest airsoft gun Ive had so far
4,Great CD!,"Don't hesistate to buy though a lot of it is instrumental music. There are some really good popular songs that I had forgotten about and was happy to hear again. As always, anything sung by Boris Gardiner is worth listening to."
4,Very similar to Barron's other manual.,"This Hamster Handbook is very similar in information and binding quality to Barron's Complete Owner's Manual. Slightly redundant, but an essential guide for hamster owners. Barron's is an excellent company that publishes quality pet owner's guides. Their books on Golden Retrievers are also some of the best on the market. The authors have much expertise in this pet and others, and do not hesitate to document it on the page."
4,Mamsters,"Next to dead chickens, Hamsters are my favorite pet. This book is exciting for any Hamster fan. It introduces us to the well soiled world of the Hamster. It details much information that I didn't even know of, for example, the Hamster is the genetic result of crossing a Ham ferret and a rat. Also, Hamsters lack teeth, they only have two bones that many people mistake as teeth. Hamsters are also vegetarians, which includes eating rice, dead insects and beans. Next to my pet Hamster, I love this book."
1,Very disappointing as Felix only makes a brief appearance.,"I purchased this video for my 3 year old as I wanted to introduce her to Felix the Cat as I loved watching him as a child. I was very disappointed with this video as Felix appeared briefly in the first cartoon (with very bad sound I might add) and after that it was followed with an assortment of obscure cartoons that don't feature him at all. Some of these cartoons were rather violent, for example one had someone's brother dying from thieves, another had a gun being used. Then again another one featured the character called ""Injun Joe"" which some might find offensive. My 3 year old luckily had walked out of the room in boredom prior to some of the more offensive scenes appearing. I don't think I will ever buy anymore Cartoon Carnival movies as now I know they will feature a popular character of their cover, but then submit you to a bunch of cartoons that couldn't be sold on their own merit."
2,Dont Waste Your Money,"This DVD is just a stupid retaliation against Welcome to Death Row. If you have Deathrow Uncut, dont waste your time with this dvd. The interview shown is the one that was taped for BET on the eve of Suge's release from prision. Doesn't talk about anything new. There is a cool video from J-Flexx, but thats pretty much it. The front cover advertises a bunch of videos WHICH AREN'T EVEN ON IT!!! If you cant find Deathrow uncut (like most of my boys), get this video. But if you wanna see some REAL gangsta stuff, i'm talkin candid exclusive. Check out Daz Dillinger's RAW (Tha Independant Game) dvd. Thats some REAL RAW gangsta stuff. Daz is from the Dogg Pound, with partner Kurupt. Wanna know how gangsta? theres a seen with Snoop and the Eastsidaz cleaning blood off walls and tables after beatin some guy down."
2,There's Two Sides To Every Story!,"Following the controversial documentary, ""Welcome To Death Row"", the notorious head of Death Row Records, Suge Knight decided to tell his version of the story. This authorized version really doesn't tell much at all about most of the events covered on ""Welcome"". In fact, it is just a couple of old interviews with Suge edited together with some classic Death Row videos (most of which were already shown on ""Death Row Uncut""). The most entertaining stuff is pulled from an exclusive BET interview with Knight just a few weeks prior to his prison release in which he claims that Dr. Dre told him that he wanted to be white and details how Snoop Dogg and Tupac had a serious falling out before Pac's death. Most of this video is dedicated to Knight trying to make his enemies look bad and plug his musical catalog as very little time is spent speaking on his own life and the start of his label. Only die-hard fans should bother with this one."
5,from a legend t legends in history,kareem is not only one of the greatest players of all-time but a very intelligent man.this book is a must for all.it's history that needed to be told.and i couldn't and wouldn't put it down.i recommend it for all.
5,Excellence,"What's more remarkable than the informative nature of this text is how it came to be...An African American sport icon who gained success through one of the primary avenues African Americans have to reach affluence (sports and entertainment) just to use it as an avenue to actually uplift the intellectual level of his community. Well done!I can't tell you how many tears it brings to my eyes to see a brother who achieve greatness through the stereotypical avenue of sports and actually use his greatness to do the truly great...uplift his people. Though there have been lists and books previous to his on the same subject, it has rarely been done by a person with such influence among youth, and for that I credit him unlike other past atheletes who simply use their stardom to sell grills, orange juice, or try and become rappers.Peace to the God"
5,Kareem you did a great job!!!,I thought I was pretty well informed on the subject of black history but that was an eye-opening book. Kareem did a great job with this book. I am proud to see a great athlete show his skills as a great scholar. Thanks for sharing these powerful profiles. I stand taller with this new knowledge of my heritage.
5,Alan needs to spend more time mastering the art of helmsman,"I don't know about the book, but the author brings an entire new meaning to the term, ""head up"".Call me Ishmal......"
2,Politally Correct or Stupid?,"The major thing wrong with this recording is the editing out of the word ""darkies"" which is like eliminating ""cowboy"" from western songs. If this guy is so sensitive, why include ""Massa"" which is a tribute to a slave master. Also, He's Got The Whole World In His Hand is generally attributed to the modern age.If you want to hear a much better rendition of Foster, and other music of the period, try and find Thomas Hampson, ""American Dreamer"" and ""An Old Song Re-Sung""."
2,Stephen Fosters America/Douglas Jimerson. tenor,Bought for stephen foster SONGS but 2 of the spiritual songs are not Fosters.And there is patriotic songs that are not FOSTERS. Your listing does not say songs from others yet there are 4 such songs.Bad advertising.
5,Great retrospective,"This is a wonderful Petula Clark retrospective. In addition to many pre-Downtown era songs never released in the US, this collection includes a full album of Tony Hatch compositions that was never released at all - and it's great material! This collection really shows Petula's evolution as a song stylist."
3,His Scandalous Duchess,"Set in the midst of the French Revolution, ""The Scandalous Duchess"" is a love story with a mystery! Though slow for the first chapter, action and characterizations pick up and the intrigue of spies, murder and sex are fully realized. Lucius Keene, a dedicated rake and determined bachelor, realizes that he must take a wife and produce a heir to the dukedom. Finding Althea Wintergreen as an excellent choice, Lucius finds he must convince her to marry him!! Althea shrouded in scandal and with mysteries to solve, can not imagine that a duke would want to marry her. I enjoyed the author's characterizations, especially of the hero. Marilyn (The Regency Lover's Cafe)"
4,My Opinion,"For the first book I have read by Sara Blayne, I found this one to be enjoyable and worth reading. I will definitely try some more of her books. Johanna Lindsey will always be my favorite, for her versatility and writing style. But Blayne was good at keeping me interested without making me want to skip some lines get through the book. A different book to read. Enjoy!"
3,My child loves it,"I came here looking for more shelly t turtle, my son loves it. Seems kooky at first but my son likes the songs and seeing the animals, he asks to watch this one all the time."
3,Could have developed further,"As this is the author's debut novel, I am able to overlook some of the issues that I noted (e.g., French characters with English names, such as Marcus Hawke). Some additional research would have been useful in that regard, but it was not egregious. There were also a couple of copy editing errors that caught my eye, but I have most assuredly seen worse.What I would have *liked* to have seen was some additional development of a rather important plot point regarding the White Russians in Paris during the time period. They are referred to, and are crucial to the story, but they are simply people who are there and nothing much is said of them. This is a very interesting period in French history, and expanding on it might have made this book more entertaining (and earned it a higher rating)."
4,How the fleet fought back,"Excellent book! Lots of photos in a clear and straightforward narrative of the salvage efforts after December 7th. I did not previously know of the post-attack concerns about CALIFORNIA, and there is much detail about the challenges in setting up a long-term salvage operation even while expanding the Pacific Fleet's forward operating base. Strongly recommended for anyone interested in Pearl Harbor and, especially, what happened after the attack."
5,EXTREMLY SAD,"THIS MOVIE DOES NOT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING, BUT MOST OF THE ORIGANAL FAIRY TELLS DON'T. IT MAKES YOU CRY WHEN SHE TURNS INTO SEA FOAM AT THE END OF THE MOVIE, WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING A GOOD ENDING. MY FAVORITE CARTOON MOVIE OF ALL TIME."
4,"Better than disney, it's the true story","i hated disneyd version of the little mermaid, when i was a child i saw the little mermaid, not this version it was even earlier, and can't find it anywhere, but this version was very good, because it tells the real story, wich until disney came along, and messed up the ending. But i liked the 1974 version better, though that one is narrated, and still isn't the one ive seen when i was a child, but this is the way it should be told, i think disney should rethink how they do there animation, it's becoming to generic, they need to get back to basic, back to the way disney used to be, something precious, and unique."
2,better than disney,this version is better than disney's.it tells the the story as it was written.if posible get the unedited version in the original box.it is harder to find-but it is worth tracking down.the uncut copy is 5 stars.
5,Tap Shoe Review,This is a very high quality tap shoe.It was delivered in a timely fashion and it fit perfectly!
1,Nasty Sunburn Red Rash,"Well I tried it on my 3 year old son and he broke out in the terrible red rash as well. I thought it was just something that would be a problem for him. Now last night I used it on my 2 year old daughter and she had the same reaction. Poor thing looks like she has been out in the sun for days. I called the Burt's to let them know about this and they gave me a case number and said that I could talk to customer service about it further. We will see what they say. They recommended that I take the bottle in to the pediatrician, and have my kids tested for allergies. Normally I love the Burt's products, but this one is a huge no for my kiddos! Works just fine on me. Spot test for sure!!!!!"
5,Better than the pink bottle lotion,"NO Alcohol!! Why would you put alcohol on sensitive baby skin? Don't, Baby Bees lotion is soothing and keeps baby's skin feeling silky soft. It isn't the traditional baby smell lotion, but it does smell great, works perfectly alternating with the apricot oil after bath.You won't regret getting Burt's Bees Baby lotion for little miracle."
5,smells great!,People want to know why I smell so good. My husband loves it and uses it everyday. Keeps skin soft and stops dry itch.
1,Itchy!,"I broke out in a horrible itchy rash 4 hours after applying this lotion. The rash is all over my body 'cause I had used the lotion all over the body! Now, I have to spend more money on antihistamine meds. Please do a patch test before applying on your child. BTW, I am 37 and not some baby with really sensitive skin."
1,Do not waste your money...can cause a serious rash,"My mother found a bottle of this lotion given to us as a part of a gift set. My 2 year old's skin is very sensitive and my mother used it thinking it was ok because it's natural and hypoallergenic. I got home to see that my daughter had a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE reaction. She has a rash from her neck down to her Pull-up. She cant sleep because of the discomfort."
3,Strong smell,"I like the consistency of this lotion - not too thick, not too thin. But the smell is very strong, my husband dislikes it very much. I agree with him when I first put it on the babies, but once the night goes by, I do enjoy the slight smell that lingers for the next 2 days. (which probably means it really is too strong!)"
2,Burts Bees is usually better,"Not my favorite burts product and I am a huge fan. This has a funny smell to it, and is very greasy. I will admit it works great, just cant get over the smell and the long lasting greasy effect."
3,A Good Reference Piece,"This book has a somewhat too academic feel. Meant more as a history book than a treatise on HY bonds - it does provide an excellent backdrop for future thought processes and how the current market's recent tightening fits with empirical analysis.I recommend this book for any junk trader or bond manager with manadates for HY as a must-read for added perspective BUt do not expect to be over-whelmed by insights into CDOs, CSOs, or trading strategies in the current markets."
4,Really Good - But Be Sure to Buy Volume 1,"My buddy has A LOT of Pickin' On and other bluegrass tribute albums and we both really like this tribute to U2. However, Volume 1 of the tribute is far superior IMO and ranks as my favorite tribute album of all the bluegrass stuff out there. I've actually come to prefer to listen to it more than the original U2 versions!"
5,A Must Read,"Not only did I enjoy reading this book, I have actually met the author at a book signing. Alice in person, is just like Alice in the book; charmimg, intelligent, confident, and very articulate. I think this is a book that would make a great movie. Very entertaining, yet very informative about a person's inner struggles of life, love, and the pursuit of happiness in a complete, well written story. I'd give it 10 stars, but 5 is the maximum. Great job, Alice !"
4,Good book,This is a story of a gender chameleon who was able to successfully integrate his two lives. I liked it.
4,An Almost Must Read & Not Just For TG People with Reservations,"An excellent book, that IMO needs to be read by all people, not just TG's their friends and Significent Others. Christian conservatives need to read it also in order to better understand the causes and non-cures of Transgend,erism. Love, not hate, scorn, or ridicule is needed to understand causes of this condition, Jesus did not preach hate, but love & understanding is what he was taught. Please read this book. I do give this book 4 Stars I do not endorse evry thing that the author has written and this book not is not for everyone."
5,enlighting,"Reading this book,was almost like reading my own story,I can relate almost to a ""T"" what she has gone thru,unfortunitly I have not been lucky enough to find a partner so understanding,her courage is a great inspiration to me."
4,Good Reading,I was hesitant about purchasing this book for fear it would be boring but I was dead wrong. This was a great book and I found I could not put it down. I wanted to know in each chapter how Alice's life was going and found many aspects similiar to my own. I highly reccomend this book to anybody.
1,No thanks,Using crossdressing as an excuse to cheat on your spouse isn't good. I bought this book expecting to hear an excellent account of how someone managed to incorporate crossdressing into their life. This memoir fell flat. I ended up disliking 'Alice' due to her selfish bahavior. Not recommended.
2,interesting yet....,"At first, I loved this book. As a woman with in a relationship with a transgendered woman, I could appreciate the insight. Yet, as I read on, I was exposed to someone who lived two lives. One for public view and one that she truly wanted. I found it disappointing that she kept a wife and children while being involved with a man when she was ""allowed"" to dress as she desired. Although interesting, for me it was disappointing. I am someone who embraces monogamy, and felt that both relationships were being somehow cheated. I accept that there are those who fully embrace polygamy. Yet, it is something I personally do not embrace in my life, nor would I knowingly purchase a book about it."
4,Figuring it out,"Thank you for sharing your story. I enjoyed reading about your life and how you've dealt with the ups and downs of a crossdressers life. However, I am left with uncertainty. You are married, however you have a boyfriend? I don't understand the logic in that. I would have to conclude that you are living a lie. That you are unwilling to accept your true self. You seem to enjoy your time with your boyfriend, yet I don't understand why you are married or why your ""wife"" allows such goings on. Does she have a lover on the side. Would you allow such a thing? I am trying to understand for I am also in the ""same"" boat of uncertainty and trying to figuring it out.You make me question myself. Am I really gay? Do I only dress up to allow myself to be with a man? I know today I would not allow or accept being with a man as my genetic being in male clothing. Trying to figuring it out. You've raised many questions."
2,Marriage Vows,What a one way street this guy/gurl is riding. So much for marriage vows. It's all about him/her. The book is well written but I can't help feel for his wife which he made a chump of. What does she get out of all this? He should be on his knees saying Novena's that she has anything to do with him.
1,Don't Get This!,"If you want to hear these songs, get Terri's versions. The people on this CD can't even get the words to Terri's biggest hit right! (They say ""ride away from love"" instead of ""run away from love"" on No Fear.) I must admit though, if you want a Reba imitation for Better Than You, you might like that one."
1,Bad Customer Service,I ordered these and then discovered I would not be needing them any longer. The seller refused to take them back. I believe I have a right to return them. Poor customer service and way overpriced.
5,Well-chosen Selection -- But Beware,"This is a well-chosen collection that is a pretty good introduction to Richard and Linda Thompson's work together and a fine starting point for anyone eager to explore Richard Thompson. However, neophytes should be aware that the new release does not include any tracks from the brilliant ""Shoot Out the Lights"", which most fans regard as their greatest achievement. If you are indeed a neophyte, you might consider grabbing the new collection plus Shoot Out the Lights, and you would then have a magnificent and reasonably comprehensive overview. By the way, if you haven't heard it, the guitar solo on ""Calvary Cross"" on this new collection is stupendous and alone worth the price of admission."
3,better songs elsewhere,"The emphasis here is on ""Island Years"", which were not necessarily Richard and Linda Thompson's songwriting salad days. I pulled out my own 17-song ""Best Of"" collection and found only four of the songs were replicated on this ""Best Of"" compilation- Roll Over Vaugn Williams, When I Get To The Border, I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight and For Shame Of Doing Wrong. While this collection pre-dates Sunnyvista and Shoot Out The lights, and misses therefore strong compositions such as Don't Renege On Our Love, Walking On A Wire, Borrowed Time, You're Gonna Need Somebody and Lonely Hearts...how could songs like Sweet Surrender, Restless Highway, Died For love, Dark End Of The Street and Jet Plane In A Rocking Chair have been overlooked? That's a lot of important material to be left out of a ""Best Of"" collection...in fact, too much for my liking."
2,Boring,"I guess you either like old English music or you don't. For me, this missed the mark. It just sounded like a derivative of so many British bands that I loved in the 70s and 80s -- without actually being them."
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Richard in the 70's was better than Richard without Linda, but still hyped by critics far above his talent."
5,damned near perfection,there is only one flaw to this cd... that being that its too short. aside from that this cd is the perfect blend of bass drums and keyboard. Since This Computer Kills it seems that Nick and Jeff are doing hella wella.. this cd is so dope i cant continue to describe it. So just buy it
5,"A Barney ""Must Have""","If you're torturing yourself over which Barney DVD to choose, stop here. This rendition of Mother Goose introduces a large number of rhymes and songs with a truly wonderful actress as Mother Goose and a magical set with real storybook quality props. My daughter adores this one and is constantly singing and dancing the many numbers from the disc. My only complaint is that in the opening scene, one of the kids is trying to write rhymes and was crumpling up sheets of paper and tossing them on the floor in frustration. My daughter started trying to do this and we had to tell her that this was a naughty thing to do and that Barney forgot to point it out."
3,A little more Mother Goose,"When we were in Hawaii, we rented this video for a week for my 2 year old. It was the only video we had, and he insisted we watch it every day.As Barney videos go, I give it a not bad. My wife and I loved there rendition of Wynkin, Blynken and Nod. 1/2 the video is also available as an episode called ""A little Mother Goose"" They add a 20 minute section where the children go to Mother Goose's house in the video.If Barney it must be (and if you have a two year old, it must be Barney) this is a nice one to have in the collection."
5,a great updated version,"This mother goose video is far better than previous ones. This is one the kids ask to see over and over again. With wonderful songs, rhymes, and costumes it makes for a great viewing experience. When the children visit mother goose at her home it becomes clear how much fun nursery rhymes can be."
3,Almost too much Singing,The kids seem to like the video but not as much as teletubbies or the Baby Einstein series. I think there is not enough play and too much singing.
3,Good DVD if you like Barney,Got this for my 2 yr old becuz she LOVES nursery rhymes. I was a little dissapointed with all the dialogue and skits that preceeded the actual singing of the rhymes because she doesn't seem interested during those times. But the parts of the DVD that was just singing were pretty good. I guess it's for older kids.
2,barney crashes,"my three year old didn't warm up to this at all. she had seen a barney tape when she visited her cousins so I thought she'd be thrilled to have it and she was excited when I gave it to her, but her enthusiasm dropped nearly immediately and I don't think she ever finished watching the entire thing."
4,Naval Aviation History Lesson,Quality of the old films reproduced in the dvd is much better than I expected.
2,Bought this CD for my wedding....,"My wife is from a Greek family and her dad wanted us to play some ""Greek"" songs at our wedding reception. We bought this CD at the last minute and ultimately after listening to it we didn't choose any songs for our wedding. It's an ok CD, but I would recommend looking elsewhere for other Greek wedding songs."
2,The Album Title is FAKE,"The contents of the CD and the cover name is not matching. The songs are NOT Greek Wedding Songs, and the Main Title of the original CD is NOT Greek Wedding. They have changed the name just to take advantage of the movie ""Greek Wedding"" which had good Greek Wedding Songs. The musical contents of the CD is only acceptable."
5,Among the best,"I have bought these for two different women -- one rather heavy and one super skinny. They look great on both bodies. The sexy lace frames her butt, and the fit in front is snug and smooth. Makes me want to get on my knees! Good quality and fast shipping, too."
4,Sexy Undies,"Bought these for my wife as V-Day gift. Look great on her, and she was pleased with fit and feel. Good price to value ratio, and shipping was timely. Came in red not beige as listed, but happier with red."
2,Cheap and not that cute!,"These panties have a really weird fit - they were very high cut in the front and showed, well, exactly what they are intended to cover up. If adjusted so that they were covering more in the front, then they tend to ride up really high in the back and stick way out of my pants. They have a cute look to them, but aren't that flattering on. I suppose if you were someone who wears your pants up past your belly button (or if you just wanted to wear them as lingerie and not under clothing), then these might work for you. The writing on the tags and stuff is in spanish as well, which I found to be a little bit annoying, as well as how much they cost to ship. I bought 3 pairs from the same seller and it cost as much to ship them (all in the same tiny plastic envelope) as the actual panties cost. I really wouldn't recommend."
5,nice,"very comfortable, look good, gf loves them and i love looking at her wearing them ... very good purchase, very happy with this product, wish they had more colors."
3,Smoking-HBO video,"This video has some great information. Good plain answers to questions. The film is very 80's with the 'big hair' and styles, but the information is still very good! I like the way it has the Sergeon General on there to answer the questions and rumors that we have heard."
4,Good debut,"I watched all the fame academy episodes, and I have to say I thought none of the contestants had a really good voice. Alistair had his good days, but he wasn't great. His song-writing however was very impressive, and so I wanted to have his cd anyway. And he didn't disappoint me.On the album his voice sounds really nice, and there are some really great ballads on the album.The only song I always skip is ""My lover's prayer"", I just can't stand that song.My fave songs on the album are ""Oblivious"" and ""You and me"".I do think there are to many covers on the album."
1,Nonsense,I bought this book because of the great reviews. I plan to send it back. Very silly and not worth the bother.
5,THIS is what you are searching for,"This book will not give you answers but it will help you to frame the questions that you need to find your answers. It does not reek of patchouli but has more soul than the typical self-help book. It is a thinking person's guide to yourself, splattered with ideas, inspirations, optional exercises, and lots of hope. Read it all at once or just little bits as necessary. I consider mine a little treasure box and that I can go back to over and over again because I have different takes every time I read it. Be good to yourself, buy this book. It will open the door to much needed fresh air in your life."
5,Delightful perusing,"What a wonderful collection of thoughts, ideas, and philosophy woven together to create a window for light! This is a refreshing change to the pervasive negative and fear based messages so common in the world today. If you're looking to find out what good can come to you and accentuating the positive this is a most excellent acquisition."
4,"Irreverent, and sometimes a little vulgar, but still Uplifting!","The premise of this book is to look at your interactions with the world from a different perspective than what most people exercise. Rather than thinking that the whole world is out to get you, the author suggests the idea that maybe the universe is working in a vast conspiracy to help you. When you get right down to it, the thought is both liberating and uplifting. As someone who is still trying to shake off the prudishness of 20 years in the Lutheran Church, portions of the book concerning sexuality were a little disturbing, but not so much as to sour the whole experience. This is an innovative piece that isn't really easy to characterize. Sometimes it rambles a little, but it still ranks highly as a uniquely exhilarating book. If you are weary of news of war and destruction, this is the antidote."
5,Pronoia now and then,"Every time I pick up this book and start to read, my mood changes. These wise words pull me right out of any of the shadows that the world can send my way. I begin to feel lighter and less worried about the state of the world. I feel hope and maybe even start to hum a ditty. Even if the universe is not constantly sending blessings our way, it can be enough to consider the posibility. I have worked for the last twenty years with the criminally mentally ill. This book is a good anidote to that toxic environment. The expanded edition makes this tome worth another read. The author came upon many of his ideas through the experience of the event called Burning Man. If you can't make it there do the next best thing and read the book."
5,"Buy this book, you owe yourself that!","What a gem of a book. My goodness, this book could not have arrived at a more perfect time. It's true the universe is conspiring to shower me with blessings. I cannot say enough positive things about this rare, special, feel-good treasure! The thing I find most inspiring is that Rob Bresney, himself paid to manufacture, produce and promote this book-OUT OF POCKET! In the end it cost him over $30,000 to get his words out there(and thank god he did). As soon as a I got this book, I ordered one for my best friend. The best $15.00 I have ever spent! Thank you Rob Bresney, thank you so very much!"
4,"Rich like a sundae, fun like a roller coaster!","Brezsny is great. This work is a modern day, adult coloring book for the soul. He poses a host of delightful questions and offers up a variety of soul-teasers. The book is written in his luscious style which draws the reader into his world of play. It's a great book for someone who is starting on a new path or graduating. I enjoyed the free flowing nature of it and its consistently positive outlook. Avoiding a lot of the politics and nonsense of the new age movement, Rob let's you make the book what you will. Get it and indulge!"
4,"All over the place, but inspiring","I didn't initially ""get"" the whole flow of this book, but after a few days, you realize that isn't supposed to flow. It's supposed to be random and full of surprises, kind of the way life is. Granted, the POSITIVE subject matter is soooooo all over the place that I honestly thought Rob Brensky was loaded on hydroponic mushrooms and/or acid when he wrote this---until then I read his disclaimer that he hadn't touched a mind altering substance since the 80's!!! LET ME HAVE WHAT HE'S HAVING, PLEASE!Seriously, though, it's a happy, inspiring, self reflective, uplifting read. It has inspired me to look at my pain and shortcomings in a positive way [even, perhaps, take a trip to the Burning Man festival]Maybe I should throw big, shiny sparkles on my pain and wear it on the sleeve of my inside-out blouse. Pronoia at work, Mr. Brensky, coming from a self proclaimed heartless bitch!!!"
4,I finally purchased the revised/ expanded version.,Brezny has given my thinking foundation a much needed boost towards liberation from the non-sense of the hysterical and dramatic world of western mental/ emotional theater. Here's one portal of possibility if one endeavors to slip the strangulating noose of IJC silliness. Onward towards liberation from domestication and Spiritual trafficking..
5,Third Eye - C'mon and OPEN,"I think Rob Brezny's Pronoia book is just what every blossoming bodhisatva needs to help her along the way. No I haven't reached bodhisatvaness yet, and maybe I never will, but I do maintain a deep interest in weirdness. If you love Rob's astrology column you will LOVE this book.I highly recommend it to any aspiring mystics, bodhi's, buddha's or just people who want to open a few more doors."
1,"disappointed -- too far ""out there"" for me","Don't get me wrong. I'm not new to New Age writings -- quite the opposite in fact, which is why I was so pleasantly intrigued with the premise suggested in the book's title and subtitle. With the author's writing style, though, I couldn't go more than a few chapters in before I realized I was growing increasingly skeptical and annoyed. Frankly, the writings read (to me) like someone who was extremely high when they were written or, less charitably, by someone who was mocking his readers.I choose to believe the author's intentions were good, and will only say that my approach to the subject matter is apparently considerably more pragmatic than the author's, um, esoteric approach.You'll find this same review by me on the same author's ""Televisionary Oracle"". That's not an accident -- his writing style completely puts me off."
2,Disappointed,"Bzezsny does not come through with his promise of an antidote for paranoia. The book is very experiential and would be adequately described as a workbook of esoteric, narcissistic, and sometimes profane, exercises that will help only those with excessive time on their hands. But then again if you are familiar with Brezsny you might get exactly what you would expect."
5,Gives me hope,"The stuff in this book will thrill you and excite you and, perhaps, inspire you to do good in the world and for yourself. The hidden secrets revealed within may even help you see the world in a new light. And to stop believing that all is doom and gloom. Turn off the news and read this book!"
5,Fantastic,"I love the whit and upbeat tone to this book. I was also surprised by the work pages, which was a delight. Lots of great quotes and as an artist and creative person, I found this book very inspirational, stimulating self originality. In a round about way, this book gives you permission to be you, your whole you!"
4,Glad to have him back in the swing of things,"Nice to see Aaron doing what he does best...what a nice CD to listen too. Of course love the soon to be classic ""Kiss This""...but there are many other well written and of course well sung songs on this CD. (Gotta luv the ""BIg Boy Toy's"") Only skip maybe 2 songs...hence the 4 star instead of 5 star rating."
5,EXCELLENT CD!!!,AARON TIPPIN SONGS ARE THE BEST!!! AARON IS AN EXCELLENT SONG WRITER AND SINGER. I LOVE ALL OF THE SONGS FROM THIS CD. LOVE THE SONG BIG BOY TOYS! THAT'S A GOOD WAKE UP SONG TO GET YOU OUT OF THE BED IN THE MORNINGS. HEARING AN AARON TIPPIN SONG AND GOING TO HIS SHOWS ALWAYS BRIGHTENS MY DAY!!
3,"Got it for ""Kiss This""","The rest of the CD isn't bad, but I have three strong favorites and the rest are good if you like strong country. (Note: I am more of a roots music fan, but the three titles I mention are standouts)Of course, ""Kiss This"" had me laughing. Nice to see a C&W; artist respecting tough women.""Big Boy Toys"" is so true. It's just as good as ""Kiss This"" in a masculine way. Had me laughing all the way through.""29 and Holding"" is another song that respects women. It talks about the Atlas level tasks a single woman has to go through just to keep the lives of the ones she loves together.Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"
5,Best beginner guitar,"I purchased a Squier Stratocaster from the guitar store I take lessons from. I bought the Peavey to do a wiring mod I found online and basically fell in love with this guitar. It is shorter, lighter, and the 'belly' cutout on the back is deeper. It is so much easier to play than the Squier Strat. As others have said it took some tweeking to get the intonation and string height just right but lots of good websites to tell you how to do that. Love the bridge humbucker pickup for hard rock. The neck pickup plays Jimi's stuff pretty well. Like I said it is way better than the Squier."
3,"If anything, good to study the history of medicine.","There's a reason that although this book was written in 1995, there have been no more recent editions. It would be way too much work for Dr. Polk to remove the constant barrage of sexism to make a future edition sellable in this day and age. Maybe this was the definitive guide for success in medicine in 1995, but I'm sure glad times have changed. Any current or entering medical student today would be shocked.I don't want to condone giving this book any more sales, but it is a moderately useful book for the medical student. It certainly is the most unique book on medical studies that I've read. With no hint of idealism it gives the veteran doctor's inside perspective to what really counts in medicine--lifestyle, money, and prestige. An interesting perspective when most of the other books I've read on the medical student experience say the same things over and over. This book definately gives a unique and probably helpful view on what is to come."
3,Works great but hole punch not so good,"Got this kit to install on my new refrigerator and save $120 on what the store would charge. Plus I get to tap it from my Watts RO unit. One complain is the hole punch to tap the water source is not great as the small hole causing slow water flow on the refrigerator. I replaced this with ""Watts PL-3003 Push Tee, 1/4-Inch OD"" which works better.Still a great price."
2,Not Great,I would spend a little extra money and buy the pieces seperately. The hose is very low end. I would go braided stainless or copper and I would not use that hole puncture connection piece. I would just get a some kind of t valve. It is easy enough to figure out I am not very handy and with the homedepot guy and some common sense I figured it out and it the out come is mutch better than this kit.
2,"May be for you, but not for me","Just as the other reviews say, the directions were not on point, then once we got it hooked up, the problem was the tubing could not take the water pressure running to the fridge even when it was turned down completely low. It kept popping off. Eventually we said for get it and ended up going to Bestbuy and buying the stainless steel product which worked absolutely great. Waste of money for us. The product seems to be made secure except for where the metal attachment and the cords meet."
1,Junk,"Leaks water from both connection ends. under or over tighten or just wright, it leaks. Photo incorrectly shows picture of nut upside down."
2,Not Happy with this product,I got this on time but when I got everything hooked up it leaked at the refrigerator. Had to buy some extra fittings and then it still leaked. Come to find out that the tubing is not a true 1/4 inch so the fittings they sent in the kit let the water leak out. Went back to the store and bought more tubing and did it all over again and now it works. The only thing that did work was the saddle piece that you attach to the water supply. Would not recommend this to anybody.
4,Pure music,"As with Beethoven each of Vaughan Williams' nine symphonies has a distinct character of its own. the eighth is the most lighthearted one, ranging in mood form energetic to festive to downright comical, with a measure of gentle melancholy thrown in for contrast.The 2nd and 3rd movements- a funny march for winds and a beautifull cavatina for strings- show VW at his best.So what if he does not grab fate by the throat in this symphony? This is music in its best and purest form. The other work on the CD-Symphonia Antarctica- has its moments but it remains essentially what it is: a glorified movie-score.Director Kees Bakels proves again that he is one of the best Vaughan Williams interpreters of this time."
3,Latin book,"This book was missing its first 7 pages, and those pages were kinda important, so that was upsetting. Other than that, there was just a bit of writing, nothing too bad throughout the book."
1,Waste of money,"This player refused to even play when the card was inserted. It just started shutting off and since not even displayed anything. Designwise this is a neat player but that is of little use if it just does not work. When I first inserted the memory card it refused recognize it... later it did... but refused to come up through the USB connection, so I used my flash reader to put the songs on it... it attempted to play one of the songs and suddenly just powered off, has not worked since other than lightening up its indego light."
3,Functional Starter MP3 player,"The Trio MP3 player has worked well out of the box. I was able to use 1Gb drive with this unit and the unit was able to play sound well after copying 100 songs to it. The only concern is that the one AAA battery runs out fairly quickly. Otherwise, this unit also acts as a secondary backup unit with a USB interface. The compact size is a winner and it is easy to carry with you. The headset speakers were not very good however do a decent job. Overall, it is decent with no frills."
1,Why sell this piece of Junk?!!,"Why do supposedly reputable companies not check out the items they sell? This TRIO MP3 player is junk. If the largest-selling O/S doesn't support it, DON'T SELL IT!!!"
5,Mystical Musical Experience,"For those who are native Hebrew speakers, this CD can become a true vehicle (Merkavah) to a divine, holy and spiritual, awakening experience. For those who are not, I recommend finding the translation in English to the words, which are mostly taken from the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Ezekiel etc.The music is mostly new age with a strong authentic sound of Middle Eastern drums, strings and flute. Some of their music has inspired me to paint pictures.I hope their music and effort will bring peace, love and wholeness to the world, which so desperately needs it.Y.Z.R"
5,not much to say but a beautifull case,"This is an impressive case for the money, very solid and well manufactured it looks killer in comparisson with my other guitar cases. the only thing I don't like is the weigth. cause this case it's like a stone."
2,"Same 'ol, Same 'ol","While an interesting compendium of information, this book tells you nothing that you can't find out on the internet for free. The author(s) would have been better off just starting a website."
1,Not worth the package it comes in,"Skips horribly, worse than any unit Ive owned. You absolutely cannot run with this. Buy an older Shockwave, this thing is [garbage]."
3,not bad,My friend had purchased this player after telling him repeatedlly to buy Phillips. At first I thought that it wasnt worth the money seeing as how electronics prices are sloping. But it wasnt bad and I am considering purchasing one myself.
1,"THIS ""TRIBUTE"" SUCKS!","How could you call this a ""tribute""? Every song is sung by ""Tapping the Urge,"" a virtually unknown band who is nothing close to the real thing. Why listen to this CD when you can listen to the real versions sung by Matchbox 20? Don't waste your money on this...go out and buy the actual MB20 cds."
1,Absolutely ghastly!,"I don't get it. I just simply do not get it. Why would anybody by this ""tribute"" which is HORRIBLE, when you could buy albums by the real Matchbox Twenty for the same price? This CD is abominably bad! They butchered every single song, especially Bright Lights! There is nothing redeeming about this CD at all. The delivery and arragements on every song are disgraceful, and the vocals are horrible. They don't do the band justice at all! I've heard better Matchbox Twenty in karaoke bars! Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. There's only one Matchbox Twenty."
1,For God Sakes Turn Around,"If you think you're getting quality here, think again baby! Don't over analyze this, it just plain sucks and makes you appreciate Rob more and more. Tribute? Hardly, just a bunch of guys with some extra money trying to ca$h in on MB20's name and music. If you're thinking of purchasing this ""For God Sake's Turn Around"". If anyone wrote a favorable review of this crap they either work for the distributor or are one of the musicians."
1,Absolutely horrible,"This is the worst ""TRIBUTE"" I have ever heard. This sounds like someone rocked out with a karaoke machine or recorded themselves singing in the shower. It seems like it should be a parody, but its not. This 'tribute' robs Matchbox Twenty's music of its soul.. Its just disgraceful.."
4,WOW THIS IS GREAT,"I MAYSELF AM NOT A BIG FAN BUT MY SISTER IS A HUGH MB20 FAN. I GETTING HER IS ALBUM JUST CAUSE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH MB20. I NEVER BELIVE A BAND COULD DO THE SONG JUSTICE BUT FROM WHAT I HEARD THIS BAND DOES A D@M GOOD JOB OF IT. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THESE SONGS ARE ROB HEART.KEEP SINGING ROB, KYLE, ADAM, PAUL, POOKIE <-------(brian for those who dont know."
5,book review for english project,The book was very interesting. I liked how it showeed a middle school kid just like me. Me and adam are just as overworked and tired. Now back to the story it is one of my personal favorites. My favorite part in the story is when you find out about the donation. At first you get all suspenful and excited. Then you start to think what is this money actually going to support. In the end it gets extremely suspensful because someone may loses their job and you are guessing why.
1,Very strange,This book was in the young adult section of my library and it picked it up. I didn't realize until looking at this site that it was meant for elementary and middle school students. It is very simplistic. It doesn't really seem realistic that so many stories would occur at the same time. One thing that bothered me especially is that the heavy mention of Adam being over involved in the beginning virtually disappears until the last few pages.
2,Disappointing,"I bought the unabridged audio book version -- 4 or 5 CDs and I was very disappointed. It is one of the few audiobooks that I chose not to finish. I am not 100% sure whether it was the reader with his overly whiney Phoebe or the writing. People in other reviews said they couldn't wait to see what happened. When I turned it off, I was almost done CD 1 and they were covering some smile contest, there was no suspense or tension. Adam is/was mildly jealous of Phoebe and there was some hint of upcoming drama over a donation made to the school. But honestly, I just didn't want to listen anymore."
5,Great story!!!,This is a lovely book my kids enjoyed. It is funny and full of real situations that you can relate to. You wont be disappointed!
1,NOT the cartoon!,"Please be aware that this is NOT the cartoon! I was fortunate enough to work with a seller who was upfront and honest with me about that, and he refunded my money!"
2,Not my favorite,"These came to me and they were not a great consistency, very gooey and hard to unwrap and eat. Messy and sticky."
1,BLAH!,"This is so low-rent and generic!!! They sound like Showtime At The Apollo contestants imitating K-Ci & JoJo! The songs are horrid.Look at the album title,how generic is that?! ...-poor talent like this baffles me.So many talented vocalists struggle and struggle while half-baked ""artists"" like these two get a record deal.This is future bargain bin material.For real."
3,It's not as bad as people set it out to be...,"Okay, I like Ruff Endz for the simple fact that they do have some real vicious songs on their sophomore CD, (and they're from MD), but for real, they actually have a good CD. What would have made the CD better is if they would have cut the serious filler tracks, (i.e., ""Cash, Money, Cars, Clothes"", ""Would U Leave Me"", ""If It Wasn't For"", and ""Dont Stop"") and replaced them with some actual good songs. It's not all about being in the club and ""sweatin like a muh-fu..."" like they make it out to be, but on the other hand, the remainder of the CD is damn good. My favorite songs on here are: (in no order)1. Will You Be Mine2. Kama Sutra3. Threesome4. Bigger5. Shake ItGet the album, you wont be disappointed..."
5,Genius,"Stew understands what makes great pop music. The Negro Problem was the most underrated band in decades.If you like intelligent, hook-laden music that you'll find yourself singing to yourself at odd times, it's imperative you buy this CD."
2,Sounds like a demo...band in need of a producer,"Ever since they changed managers several years ago, this band has begun a steady decline. If they stopped surrounding themselves with ""yes"" men and groupies, the essence of this band could be saved. Stew is highly entertaining and can write a pop tune second to none but this effort leaves me indifferent. If they ever returned to the original lineup and LISTENED to credible advisors, they could be as big as the B-52's or Blues Traveller."
3,"Nice look and fit, but the belt clip is disappointing.","Very well made. Very snug fit (I thought I was going to break the phone trying to get the covers on. Then I got a plastic ""zip"" tie and slid it under the clear plastic window. This released the plastic and it slid on really nice...really, really helps!) The belt clip does not detach from the phone which was disappointing. Clips nicely to regular belts, but any wider or thicker than usual belt causes the phone to slip off. Ouch!"
2,Top is tight and plastic is not clear,"The design of this case is really nice if you don't need the swivel clip. The top is too tight. Once you get it on it is nearly impossible to get it off. The worst part about it is that the plastic over the main display isn't that clear. Mine shows a ""moisture"" looking appearance from where the plastic touches the screen. It goes away when it has air under it, but mostly it is always ""wet"" looking. I will probably take it back if I can get the top back off."
3,Recoding quality not great,"I was a bit disappointed with the recoding quality and it not containing some of their big hits, but it is a decent live capturing of Y&T live."
2,Little informaiton,"I was a bit disappointed with the quality of this video. Too short, too little information."
2,"Great Idea, But Breaking Tools Far From ""Toddler-Proof""","A terrific concept, clever and visually appealing, teaches children not just how tools work but also about shapes, colors and counting. Parents and children alike want to love this book, which is why it is so disappointing to find that the ""sturdy cardboard"" tools break quite easily after being played with just a couple of times by a typical toddler.My 3-year-old boy was in tears when both the wrench and hammer broke during the first day of use because he bent them. Toddlers will bend toys if they are bendable! When we taped the tools back together, they no longer fit into their slots.This seems to be a book that evolved from the author's great idea into the publisher's slick package. In the end, it is frustrating and sadly impractical for its recommended age group."
2,Would need constant supervision,"Got it to give as a Christmas present but decided to take this one back. Great concept, I'm sure a lot of kids will love the book, but bear in mind the other reviews that caution about how easily the tools will fall apart, this book will have a fun but limited life span! It might be good to bring out at special times for parents and children sharing a book together, quiet time, etc. You couldn't give kids the book and have them play with it unsupervised for very long before something would get broken. What's the point of tools if you can't use them?!"
4,Great Father & Son Activity,"First off, ""My Little Blue Robot"" is a better book than this one. While, my son still likes it, there is more to do with the robot. The robot is limited to only 2 tools, and the toolbox has around 8. He enjoys using the wrench, drill, screw driver and saw. The hammer, ruler, and pencil are less enjoyed.My 3 year old will typically request both of these books every weekend. It's a quick book to do and we can go through all the tools in about 15 minutes."
1,Not happy,The book was cute but the tools in it were all bent and some of the pages were bent and had sticky stuff on them!! It was a christmas present!! I would have like to have knowned that it wasn't worth buying. But it said good condition it wasn't!! I will never buy books from here agian.
5,A great book for the little Mr. Fix-it,"My son is almost three years old and absolutely loves this book! He enjoys taking the tools out and hammering, sawing, screwing, drilling, and drawing plans of the things he's going to build. This book is also a puzzle as the tools only fit into the slots a certain way. It's a great book for children who are fascinated with construction and tools."
1,rapidly destroyed,"If you like toys which won't hang around for years this is perfect for you. My son wanted to really screw and pound and had a little difflculty at first understanding the limitations of these tools and keeping them in the context of this book. There are many better choices for play tools out there, save yourself from having to deal with the disapointment of your child when his screwdriver or drill tears in two."
1,horrible,"These wires do not fit well at all,too long or too short. The one wire is stretched from the spark plug to the cap so bad it won't let the dist rotate. I tried using them but I'll be be buying different ones."
4,great book - but watch out for the size!,"This book was everything I would expect from DK - great pictures, good information, easy to search through, but I did not expect it to be only three inches high! Now I know to look for the dimensions with every book I order. A great book for children to look through, because the book is really to small for adults to use on a regular basis."
1,LOTS OF CATS...BUT STILL DISAPPOINTING,"There is some interesting information contained here but it is still a major disappointment. Unless one physically sees the book before ordering, one can easily take note of the 400 pages and feel they are getting something of value for their dollar. However, it should first of all be noted this book is less than four inches high! I found the book just too overwhelming small and frustrating to bother with and certainly not worth the price.If the reader truly wants value for their dollar, I highly recommend any and all of the books by Desmond Morris, such as ""Cat Breeds of the World."" Readers should not be disappointed in any of his books. They contain an endless wealth of information and beautiful photographs of cats. In my opinion, all of his books are worthy of a five-star rating and certainly worth the money."
5,2000 Edition: CATalog,"I'm submitting my review under this book as it is essentially -- almost exactly -- the same book in a beautiful thick little paperback. I adore this book! Of course it could be because I found ""dead ringers"" for both my Sabrina (pg60 -- Norweigian Forest cat) & my best friend's Gracie (pg 222-223 in my addition -- a Chartreux) We were both wrong on our cats' heritages. (Adopted.) I always thought she was mostly Maine coon because my neighbor's Norweigian was so much bigger. (Think he's just a tad overweight though.) 'Brina is a fit 15 lbs. I just love her long whiskers, big eyes & loving disposition. She is also good with my little grandchildren.Anyway, it's like a cat show in a book! Dr. Fogle knows his stuff."
4,"Harsh, but wonderful","This was the second Williams work I read after the superb ""Taking Care"", and I was not disappointed.I'll start with the minor negative: Ms. Williams is best at short story length. At novel-length, her wry, existential cynicism becomes something endured rather than enjoyed. Her characters are always desperate, always ignoring a problem in front of them or escaping another, and always as baffled by themselves as by strangers. Nonetheless, this is luminous, excellent writing, full of brilliant descriptions, and often as darkly hilarious as it is disturbing. Her frequent comparison to O'Connor is unfair to both writers; Williams's style--a surreal paradox of compassion and misanthropy--is unique, and not to be missed.Recommended."
4,Not Just A Guidebook -- Great for Armchiar Hiking,"I would imagine that this book would be considered a reference, but I read it cover to cover. Mr. Schlimmer does a great job of putting you on the trail, and sprinkles his prose with just enough humor to make it fun. Unfortunately, he also sprinkles his prose with a little too much politics for my taste, but I still greatly enjoyed the book. I'm also unsympathetic with the reader who was expecting more about the AT. The book cover explains clearly what trails are included, and the author gives a good justification for his choices in the introduction -- which, by the way, is pretty darned good as well."
5,Spotlight on the Underdogs,Schlimmer's book spotlights all of the long distance underdogs across the US. This book will introduce you to long distance trails that you might not know even exist. The contact info gives you a starting point to start researching your trips. The photos and humor will have you reading for hours. Few get to discover American like a hiker does.
1,"Misleading Book Title, Buyer Beware!","This is fine book except for one major problem: the title. Imagine if you bought a book called, ""A Hiker's Guide to Inca Trail"" and when it arrives you find out that it talks about parts of the Inca Trail in Bolivia (which few venture) but mention the part of the Inca Trail that everyone thinks about when they hear ""Inca Trail"": Macchu Picchu.Or imagine a book called, ""A Hiker's Guide to America"" and then only talks about trails in Alaska and Hawaii.By not delving into the PCT, AT, and CDT, known as the Triple Crown of thru-hikes, this book does not live up to its title. The Triple Crown are America's biggest and most alluring thru-hikes. To not include them in the Top 25 is a crime."
5,excellent,"I usually don't listen 2 rap, but I can put in and listen 2 this whole cd.I'll be looking out for more of Disconnected Clique.Hope i won't have to wait long!:}~~"
4,Off The Hook !!!,This Cd is the .... This is my Thrird copy my friend and My wife took my other copies.This is one of the best Cd's I have every heard and I heard a lots of them. You can checkout there website @ monumentalrecords.com and get a sample of there music. Much Love to the Disconnected Clique I would Like To Meet the group I'm A rapper myself. Later PeepsP.S. When Is the next cd do to drop!!!!!!!
5,"""I Know"" this cd is tight",This cd is tight front the intro till the end. The song I really like is Connections & I Know. But this cd is something to to ride to. I hope to be seeing more cd's in the future.
3,Good idea doesn't fit as simply as stated and in my case at all.,"Company's web site said it would fit my model mower but it did not. I had to fab up my own solution to make it fit. However, it's a good idea and now that I have it installed it works well. It is well constructed. However, if you are not adept at mechanical work and you do not see your exact model of mower on the companies web site I would not recommend that you make this purchase. I my case I had to add a separate metal plate to both sides, drill holes to mount it to the mower as well as holes for the kit in order to make the kit fit my Toro."
2,Very basic at Best,"This was a very well reviewed product, so I purchased it.My Honda HHR didn't come with swiveling wheels in the front and with the purchase of my new home, it was required. If I had known now, BEFORE installing them, I would never had wasted $70 for them.These are very basic at best. A sturdy, but poorly designed product. If you put enough holes and slots in them, well it will fit just about anything. The pins for height adjustment have fallen out so many times I had to replace them with screws and lock nuts. I wish I had done this before I ran over them with the mower. I also used a threaded rod between the wheels to straighten them and give more support.I emailed Eazy Mow with no response.I'm not a complainer, just a dissatisfied customer with a poor product and out $70."
2,"Good idea, flawed design, no good on uneven ground or dense grass","I liked this idea, but as others said they only work on flat level surface. If you don't have a flat level surface you end up fighting to keep the mower where you want it. Also the hard small wheels sink into thick/dense (not tall) grass making the mower hard to push (even with self propelled) and this results in an uneven cut and gouges in your turf. Maybe with larger/wider/softer wheels this would work on thick/dense grass, but my healthy lawn is too much for them and I've had to remove them. Waste of money for me."
3,Not for Husquvarna model,"The product is great! However, it did not work with our Husquvarna model. We had to do some tweaking to our mower to get the wheels to fit. (ie. the bolts it comes with are too big to fit in the existing holes) We had to drill a new hole and make the other hole larger to attach the wheels to the mower. We love the product, it just isn't generic to this brand."
4,excellent product,Works perfectly...well designed and easy installation. I did need to drill one mounting hole on each side but nothing difficult at all.
3,Works Great if your lawn is perfectly flat ...,This product is made well but it is only good if your yard is flat. It doesn't work well on hills or uneven ground as you cannot steer it straight. Kit comes with pins to lock the wheels but that defeats the purpose of have the zero turn capability.
1,EASY MOW NOT SO EASY,the pins rattle out in the middle of use. very hard to change levels. Took them off. THEY WOULD NOT LET ME RETURN THEM SINCE I HAD TO DRILL A EXTRA HOLE TO INSTALL THEM.
2,Horrible product,"At any case, you will most likely need to modify your lawn mower to fit this kit which requires you to drill a few holes. The kit is a joke, these people that give this product a 4 or 5 stars should not of rated this product. First of all the pins that keep the wheels together will continue to fall apart, you will also have to find a way to modify the pins to make sure their secure. For me i have to weld everything to make it secure.The worst thing about this product is, the metal frame is not strong enough, if you have a lumpy lawn, the metal frame might bend alot, which cost you alot of time trying to hammer it back to straight.Product does not worth what their asking for. People that mow their lawn regularly or professional landscapers should never buy this product. See the picture? looks cheap, because it is."
3,"Easy come, easy go.","I returned this lens the same day I received it. I found the macro function to be combersome, less than crisp, and with a miniscule depth of field. With no lock for the lens barrel, the lens extension continually slid forward with the slightest negative angle. And, once extended, the lens was awkwardly balanced and difficult to steady on my Novoflex head."
1,GRR,"well, it looked pretty cool until i find out what i ordered didnt come with the base unit :] ugh..."
4,Awsome,"I got this last summer,and it worked great,we have broadband and 8 computers,so I just leave one one all the time and use it whenever I want.The only problem I have with it is that the rechargeable battery only lasts 5 minutes or so,but I'm sure thats easily replaceable.Overall great product."
1,Do not buy... no warranty from Motorola,"At first, this seems like a good product... brand name, ease of use, low cost. But if the battery goes dead, there are no replacements made anywhere and because this item is so old, Motorola no longer provides any form of warranty for this product.I bought this item from BuyJFGoods here on Amazon as a Christmas gift and it never worked because the battery was dead and would not charge.- as far as the item is concerned, do not waste your money on something that is so old that the manufacture does not cover any longer.- as far as BuyJFGoods is concerned, let's see if they assist me with a refund where I do not have to pay return shipping since I paid for shipping to get it in the first place."
5,Living the Good Life Revisited,"I remember reading this book many years ago. It is about a couple who decided that they could simplify their lives by changing the way they lived. My future daughter in law wants to live in a yurt and go off the power grid. I thought this book would be a good choice for her, since it is about a simpler way of life which is still relevant today, especially with global warming and population growth stressing the environment. My son tells me his finace is devouring the book. It's an ""oldie but goodie."" Check it out."
5,Good product and a good price,No problems with the battery. I searched the net for the best price. This was by far the best price.
5,Good quality,This one looks good. A battery I bought from another vendor only lasted a couple of months. This one is doing ok.
4,Farily good life,"This battery had a fairly good life of around 2,5 hourswhen it was installed fot the first time"
4,The Steps,"I thought this book was exciting, and I recommend it to fifth graders everywhere. I liked the details, they made the book very interesting."
2,Grill Brush,Grill Brush would not withstand the barbecue heat. Description claims it is resistant to 400 degrees temperature.I would like to know how to get a replacement.
2,Disappointing,"I was not as impressed with this book as the other reviewers. Being a Robin Hood story, I expected at least some action. There was very little and the plot moves very slowly. I am one to apprecieate a fair amount of romance in a story but there's far too much love-making in this book, for me. Every section of the story ends with one couple or another becoming ""sky-clad"" and releasing their passions. There are several couples in this story and they're all completely devoted to one another as the author makes clear time and time again. The new addition of magic and the Goddess to the legend is interesting but not enough to save the plot. There's just too much romance, for me, and not enough of the ""classic"" Robin."
1,What a piece of junk !,"A cheap no good copy, I have a good Magnavox Video player and it won't track, big line right down the middle whata waste of good money!"
4,Tim Powers and Jim Blaylock at their most playful.,"This excellent little book is purported to be a collection of the work of a purely fictional writer named William Ashbless.The authors originally created him when they were literature students at Fullerton State University near L.A. Over the years he has either appeared in or been referred to in most of their books and Tim Powers considers him a ""good luck charm""."
1,Tribute to Puddle of Mudd,"Ok, so isn't a tribute album suppose to be for bands that have been around forever and that actually kick ass??? Don't get me wrong, I kinda like Puddle of Mudd, but to do a tribute album for them?? Is that really necessary? I must admit I like their new single, but the video needs to be thrown out. They are NOT Nirvana, and will never be, so stop trying so hard."
4,Great Effort...,"You STILL can't beat the original Puddle of Mudd songs. If you want to buy this album, I highly reccommend you go and but Puddle of Mudd's ""Come Clean"" or upcoming ""Life on Display"" albums. That way, you would be able to appreciate this tribute CD MUCH better. If you buy this before you buy ""Come Clean"" you will absolutely hate it. Now, tribute CDs are hardly ever good. But I believe that it's great that a band has such a great interest in Puddle of Mudd; and they did not do a bad job on tributing them. Puddle of Mudd deserves an AWESOME tribute CD, and this truly is NOT it... For a tribute CD, it is not bad. I know I'm probably alone on my opinion, but I really do appreciate and like this tribute album.-Christian"
5,RAZA de la TIERRA,"Like SANTANA and EL CHICANO, TIERRA is one of the few groups to maintain their creativity and vitality. GEMA, (from thier debut album-which I still have) was our wedding song, bringing tears to the eyes of the tios and tias. TIERRA, unlike MALO or AZTECA, was fortunate to have hits which made it to the airways, keeping thier influence alive for almost thirty years. Today TIERRA has a strong following. TIERRA also created a local pride with the likes of LOS LOBOS and EL CHICANO. Whether you call it the EAST LOS sound or the CHICANO sound, TIERRA is another example of what CHICANO PRIDE sounds like.// CON SAFOS!"
3,Even lesser Dunning is not bad,"My fellow reviewers on this page are obviously Dunning fans who are feeling disappointed. It's true that this is not up to the other two -- and later -- Dunning mysteries, but even early Dunning has qualities to recommend it. The author admits the ""rawness"" of his work in the highly informative forward. But he has nothing for which to apologize. He has delivered a well-plotted thriller that could use a little more in the way of detailed characterization; everything else is a quibble."
3,"Once Jim Ryan gets on the road, the book is off and running","This is a reprint of an early attempt at writing mysteries. As a fan of John Dunning, I'd read anything he wrote cover-to-cover. Even so before it was reprinted, he should have thrown out the first 1/4 of the book and figured out a different reason for his protagonist to spend the rest of the book in a spell-binding treasure hunt, part of it underground. The author is as good withspelunking as he is with rare books. The last 3/4of the book is so good, you won't be able to goto bed until you've finished it."
2,"Can't believe it's by the same author as ""Booked to Die""","I loved Booked to Die and Bookman's Wake, but couldn't find much to like in this one. It never caught my interest, and the plot line was convoluted and unbelieveable."
3,awful start,"I wasn't entirely sure about this book from the cover copy. I just finished chapter 1 and have no incentive to keep going. Dunning never tells us what happened with the secretary, might as well have cut all those paragraphs."
4,A lovely addition to any meal,"Just think of the looks on your guests face when they ask ""What's for dinner?,"" and you say ""Fresh boneless New England Scrod!"" Everyone loves to hear the word ""Scrod"" and it's the perfect way to begin an evening of fine dining."
5,Fresh,"Wasn't the 3lb, but ordered scrod/cod in a smaller size from Fisherman's Fleet. The product impressed me by smelling really fresh. Like just unloaded from the boat fresh, not the stuff from grocery stores (even good quality grocery stores) that inevitably smells a little fishy in a bad way. Tasted great baked, too."
5,GREAT COLLECTOR'S ITEM,"I am a beginning tennis player and love the sport. It is an excellent video and was everything I hoped it would be. I loved seeing the old tennis greats: Chris Evert, Tracy Austin, Steffi Graf and of the men: Connors, McEnroe, Agassi, Lendl and Sampras.....It was awesome just reliving all the final moments of their winning.The players of that decade really showed a lot of emotion, spunk, and grit.Last but not least, Connors comedic court display when his opponent fails to return the shot always keeps me entertained.Looking forward to seeing another video for the next decade of U.S. Open Champs."
3,Conartists seeking a husand,"This movie is one of young lady seeking a rich husband with the aid of two people.I'm not much on movies that have magic in them otherwise this would be a good movie. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. performace is great. I especially enjoyed the actress Helen Broderick, I'm hoping they will release more dvds with her in them."
4,"If You Like Classic Romantic Comedies, This Is A Good One!","I love this movie. I bought it for my cousin for Christmas, since it's a favorite of hers, and my son taped over the last 5 minutes of the copy she let me borrow.This is definitely one to add to your collection if you like classic romantic comedies."
4,Rock your face off,"I was fortunate enough to see their live show. Living in Altoona, PA, they have stopped by twice and there is always an above normal turn-out for a show when they play with the local bands. If you like just ballz to the wall scream-core, much like other talented bands, ""majority rule,"" ""crestfallen,"" ""the index,"" and the late ""pg. 99,"" this album is a must for anyone dedicated to this music scene. From beginning to end (granted not a long time) this is a great CD. Also watch out for ""The fury of turd ferguson"" to join these ranks someday."
1,"They should have called it ""Bored to Death""","Lugosi's only color film is for his most devoted fans only. A good cast (Lugosi, George Zucco, Nat Pendleton, etc.) can't save this incoherent mess, plagued with a confusing script and terrible editing. This one stayed on the shelf for three years before it was released. If you have to have all things Lugosi, here it is."
3,Not as expected,Rather boring to little ones. I was hoping it would be more exciting and engaging to get a toddler to want to try it. I think if they showed the kids dancing to music first it may have been more interesting to the tots. Instead it stats with music-less step instruction
4,"fun , instructional","Bought this video from a book club order magazine.If your child is interested in tap, this will be a good way to start and find out. It would be a better idea for AMAZON to show a picture of this video to its customers though."
1,it was terrible,we love Amanda Burton but that was one of the worst sets we have ever purchased. This serieS should never have been made and I question that good actor would ever taking this role HORRIBLE WASTE OF MY MONEY
4,Another GREAT find!!,"I bought this strictly because I loved Prime Suspect and figured this might be as good. Turns out that was really good thinking! This series is intelligent, suspenseful, fun, well-plotted and a sheer delight to watch. My only beef is with one of the critical plot points which has a seasoned police vet like the commander sleeping with a convicted killer and murder suspect. I almost gave up on it because of that unbelievable premise, but it is a testament to how good this show is that I was hooked despite it. So worth it! Really excellent show!"
3,From The Vaults & More...,"A must for Nazareth fans ! Early material from their best albums.Hard rock titles such as: Railroad Boy,Friends,Down, If you see my baby, Hard Living,Greens and classics like : Love Hurts, My white bicycle plus live material.From root to stem, some great songs within this cd. Rare titles, B side singles. This is not to be confused with a greatest hits package or anthology, this is really stuff from the vaults...Enjoy !"
5,Great Gift,I purchased this for my daughter to complete her collection. This is a great series for families or kids ages 6-13. It is funny and keeps you entertained.
5,Love,The full house series is one for the whole family. Each episode will make you laugh and maybe cry. It teaches life lessons and is just a great show.
3,All good things come to an end,"I grew up on the series, and introduced it to my younger sister on dvd. She loved it.But the once cute kids were growing up, and the show really lost it in the later seasons. I thought the final episodes had some nice call-backs to the old days - including bringing back DJ's boyfriend Steve, but overall nothing about season 8 was great.That said I'm still glad that it's avaliable on dvd, and that I bought it. If you loved the series, then the final season is a necessity."
4,Great introduction to Alamo history,"""A Time to Stand"" is perhaps one of the best books ever written on the historic Battle of the Alamo. Walter Lord, a reporter turned non-fiction writer, focuses mainly on the general events that took place during the siege, rather than on specific character studies of the three main heroes (Travis, Bowie, Crockett), but that does not in any way tarnish the end result. His account is very vivid and detailed, and gives the reader a real sense of what it must have been like to be behind those old adobe walls. An good addition to the book is a fold-out map of the Alamo complex as it looked in 1836, plus various pictures and facsimiles of letters sprinkled throughout. A highly recommended read and wonderful introduction to the real story of the Alamo."
4,Must-read History of the Battle of the Alamo,"Walter Lord's ""A Time to Stand"" is a great history of the Battle of the Alamo for the general reader. This short, readable book should be read by every American to get the basic history of one of the most famous battles in American history.Lord tells the story of the Battle of the Alamo, and the campaign leading up to it, in an easy-to-read yet detailed narrative without getting bogged down in details. He brings life to many of the famous and less-than-famous defenders. He also describes the political climate in Texas and the United States and why the Battle of the Alamo, a loss for the Texans, was so important in Texas' journey to independence.Just as importantly, though, Lord continues the story beyond the fall of the Alamo. He continues the campaign to its conclusion as Sam Houston and his Texans destroy Santa Ana's army at San Jacinto, with ""Remember the Alamo"" as their battle cry."
1,Very little value of as an occult work.,"This text may be the work singularly most reponsible for the propagation of the Wiccan myth. That is, it is incredibly famous in the Neo-Pagan community (not the genuine occult community) and has done more damage to the Craft than good. This book and its clones have cut both our legitimate Wiccan friends and Wiccan elitists off to the rest of the occult community by ignoring the fact of the hundred of Non-Wiccan magickal systems do exist and some are older than Goddess cults. Besides being dry the magic is non-scientific and the histories propel an anti-science, anti-Christian feel, even though in other areas the book specifically says this is not its aim. In short, only fair as an introductuion to Wicca, and pure trite as an intoruduction to occultism on the whole. Even more damaging to the true Wicca than it is to those of us in Non-Wiccan magick."
1,This is NOT a good book,"I'm sure that there are worse introductions to Witchcraft, but this is probably one of the worst. Buckland doesn't stop at plugging the tradition he created, Seax Wicca. He commits the crime of being boring. If you want to read an introduction to Witchcraft, read Scott Cunningham's Wicca or Silver Ravenwolf's To Ride a Silver Broomstick. If you want to find out about Seax Wicca, try Raymond Bucklan"
2,A nice attempt but...,"Raymond Buckland, having been initiated and ordained by Gerald Gardner, who (quite frankly) claimed initiation and ordaination by an old Witch who was long dead (his creditials thereby questionable), never quite managed to gain my respect in the Magickal world.This book, while chocked full of information, is also written from a narrow point of view. There is much information in this work with which I cannot agree. His variation of Wicca is not only heavily Gardenarian, but also smacks of trite and sometimes superior statements which degrades the value of the work.While it tries to include everything, this is a dry work which lacks exuberance. It is systematic in that it feels like it is bound by its own restrictions. It is methodical as it maintains the same inconsistencies throughout. And it is plodding as it trudges one by one through what should be joyous rites and celebrations.Frankly, I was not impressed."
1,Eh...,"How bland, how dry, how self-absorbed. This is a happy little introduction to something that is frankly somewhat dangerous, scary and powerful. NOT happy, safe and whimsical. This is not a serious book by any stretch and does more harm then good. It was written for an 8 year old mind. Try Mastering Witchcraft by Paul Husen for more realistic and relevant information. It does have some info, but don't delude yourselves, witchcraft is for real and needs to be taken far more seriously."
1,SICK TWISTED SEXIST,"DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!! EVER!!!!!NO NO NO . This man is terrible. He only believes in covens, thinks you have to tie up someone naked with a blind fold to initiate them, believes you have to have a priest and priestess... and the priest is the Boss, and the only true way is his, otherwise you are doing it wrong. I've only read the book I did'nt buy it Thank Goddess!!!!! This man has no right to call himself a witch, he is sick."
4,Great for starting out,"I bought this book because I read somewhere that it was a great beginners book. And I have to admit, it is wonderful to have so much information so clearly laid out. I would recommend this as one of your books on your shelf."
5,I love it.,I am learning alot from this book. My name has already found me with this easy to do book.
5,Good book for beginners and others.,"The Big Blue book, while having an introduction that is largely trash, presents the most workable colelction of ritual and theology a beginner can have.The material is not disjointed-it falls neatly into place. Ritual A goes with ritual B.Like other books, it's dated. It says 1986 classic, but I believe it's actually older, from the 1970s (that's what the copyright data says) and it fits more into the 1970s boom of Witchcraft books than the later ones.That being said, his ritual tool creation stuff and runes are not worth the paper they are printed on, but even with those flaws it is just such a workable book that it is worth every cent.It is also good for people who are a little fluffy who want to reign in their fluffiness.. A good book for people who feel they've wandered too far from Wicca and need more info."
2,Complete Book of Witchcraft?,"Well I must say the book sounds just like a course in Seax Wicca Buckland offered years ago through a correspondence course. Is it? Hmmm Let me see Raymond and Tara Chochran-Buckland? Who is Silver RavenWolf? It sure seems confusing in the world of writers to me. Oh well, I must comment that no book is ever complete is it? How many fiction writers are writing these types of reads? Just curious."
4,This book was very good to get some basic knowledge.,"This book allows each reader to get a little of the basic knowledge that is needed to pursue their own paths, if that path deals with magic"
3,Not That Good,"First of all, Witchcraft and Wicca aren't the same, I know because I practice both.Ok, this book had some good information, but it was boring and dry, and it's not a training book for the third-degree as the introduction said, but I wasan't expecting it to be. This book is all coven-orianted with only one chapter on Solitary Witches.I am glad that I payed half-price for this book in Barners & Nobels. You can get better information in other books.Hope this review helped you."
4,Great book,"I found this book very interesting and informative. It covers many many subjects including herbs, divination, spell casting, rituals, and more. Also, there was some review about him promoting Gardners made up religion. News Flash: All religions are ""made up"" They all came from somewhere. People aren't born with religion and hello, before Jesus came, his teachings weren't there and you could say therefore that when he came he ""made up"" a religion. In any case, for anyone who's truly interested in the craft, I'd recommend this book, but not as a complete source since some subjects should be covered in more depth than he gave them."
5,My first and best book on Wicca ever!!!,"Unfortunately, I haven't brought it yet. But my priestess andfriend has it. I loved the book completely. It was a great book fora beginning coven. We learned a lot of things from this book. If you are a beginner this is a great book to start with!!"
3,Not as Fair or Foul as others say...,"Some say this book is one of the greats on the subject, some say it is one of the worst. These people are both wrong. The book does have it faults but it sets out what it accomplishes to do wonderfully. It is fair to all manor of Wiccans and in my opinion treats women fairly with sexist undertones (which is understandable in the time frame Bucklnad grew up) I would recommend this to anyone as a starting point or old favorite. But it is only a small piece of the puzzle as for there being one book on Wicca, I don't think there is everyone must follow there own path..."
2,I traded mine in,"Sorry but this guy is so full of himself. I didn't even get a quarter of the way before I traded it in for another book on Wicca. It's just another case of blah blah blah me me me. The information felt fake, boring, lacking in anything interesting and as if I had just picked up a very bad paperback book from a thrift store. I don't want to be sold Wicca."
1,Complete?,"I'd say it is well written to convince the novice and even some intermediates that eveything in it is correct and ""complete"". It is not. It simply shows that people will buy whatever they are looking for no matter the truth or fiction of it all without even investigating the information. One shouldn't take this book as 'gospel' should I say? If it were so complete and so rigid in truth, then why is the same author continuing to put out other books filled with nonsense saying that they also are true. The only Craft I see being used in all these books by the Bucklands is Craftiness in Writing Skills. Keep up the good work. You page claims over a million in print of all your works. Good Paycheck eh?"
5,A good book,"Merry Meet!I find this book to be a very good read! I've been praticing witchcraft for about 5 years and it's good to see a book that doesn't confuse ""Wicca"" with ""Witchcraft"" cause i'm a witch NOT A WICCAN!I like this book because I finally have a good book to teach my students from. I use many books but by far this is my best book used for teaching.If anyone needs some extra help in witchcraft training you can e-mail me at -Midnyght_Raven-@pathwaytodarkness.comI teach for all ages. SEROUS STUDENTS ONLY! AND YOU MUST HAVE SOME BASIC KNOWN ON THE CRAFT!-Midnyght Raven-"
3,A classic but...,"Not to much to my taste. None the less, it has a lot of basic information. I would rip out the chapter on demons before giving it to a new witch or impressionable one. I find the chapter on calling up demons disturbing and dangerous. The rest of the book is filled with important information. Buckland is just not my cup of tea. I have his candle magic book and I do adapt some of his rituals. Over all, I would not recommend this except to someone with some time on the path and a good dose of common sense and well grounded."
2,OK,Though Buckland did give a plethora of useful information is Obsession o himself and his own accomplishments distracted from the book as it became more about vanity of his own doings rather than a Craft instruction
3,Eh... so-so...,"Ehhh... There's a lot of various stuff... It's good for someone if they want to expand on stuff, and it's awesome for studying the Seax-Wica way. The good parts are pretty much the instructional sections (forging an athame, numerology, things like that). NOT too good for Solitaries, because it's centered around Covens... If you want to spend for a few well-written sections, go for it. If you want a book that's great as a whole, don't bother."
5,Worth every star,"My sister recommended this book to me several years ago. The author is great at explaining everything in easy to understand chapters. At the same time, even a person with a lot of knowledge in the subject will still find plenty to learn from! This book is easily worthy of all 5 stars."
5,Worth it... but not a standalone,"Like all books on Wicca, this doesn't do well as a stand alone. Buckland can be silly at times, but this book is far more good than bad.Compared to the rest of the field, this book is in the top 4 or 5."
3,"Lots of info, not enough emphasis on one thing","I think this is a great book to get you started thinking about all the different things there are to learn in wicca. The problem was that it tried to cover too much. There wasn't enough emphasis on one particular subject. I find this a lot in books on the craft where the author tries to cover too much territory. I did though love this book because of the various thing it gave some information on, thus leading me to other areas of study. It was pretty good all in all although more for the physical acts of witchcraft than for explaining the reasons and spiritual beliefs behind it. The one section I didn't quite agree with was the section on the history of witchcraft. The rest I found quite interesting. All in all, a pretty good book."
4,Awesome,I loved the book. Although i would have liked to read a bit more about calling tne watch towers.the contents of the book were amazing .I haven't seen any book that had so many different rituals in it .everything was so interesting
5,The ultimate beginner's reference!,"I bought this book when I began practicing Wicca- almost 3 1/2 years ago. This book gives you basic history and beliefs. It gives the information new practitioners need about numerology, the ingredients of an alter, herbalism, etc. It is also an excellent referance on divination, from Tarot to Cheiromancy (palm reading). And remember all you newbies out there: ""An' it harm none, do as thou will."" Blessed Be"
1,Would you buy a used religion from this man?,"Buckland's book is crap. If you are not into 'Saxon' wicca, and not into being told one true way, this is not the book for you. 95% of his quotes are from his own works, his history is shaky where it isn't outright wrong, and his ethics are more than a little shaky. For those who are interested in anything besides Gardnerian wicca and its offshoots, it's not quite useless. Though as a beginner book it's worse that useless since it predicates one true religion of Wicca. Pfaugh. Pick up 'The elements of...' series, and take a look at ""Drawing Down the Moon&quot...."
1,Buckland needs some help,"I would probably use this book if I were writing a ritual and wanted a variety of ideas (there are some good tidbits). I would definitely NOT use this book as a guide for someone just beginning to seek into Wicca. It's pedantic, dry and dull. Buckland can't get past his own tradition of Seax-Wica, and although he does plenty of grousing about other traditions incorporating Ceremonial elements he seems to have a real ceremonial hangup of his own. It was also patently dangerous and very irresponsible for him to reccommend Culpeper as a guide for those wishing to practice *modern*, *medical* herbalism. Misguidance like that is the last thing the Craft needs, which is why Buckland should have been extra-careful to avoid slipups. Well, he wasn't."
5,Best Informative Guide Book.,Buckland's Bomplete Book Of Witchcraft gave me all the information I needed to guide myself on my path. It gives you the basics principles from a beginning to an end. Starting with a brief history of the old religion. It's a must get. It'll be a ray of light in your life.
4,"Fantastic for beginners, novice or those just dipping their toes","This book, for the most part, is an easy read. Prepare to pull out your high-lighters on some chapters (lessons), some of the information is just fasinating. For someone who would really like to learn a decient history of the Craft this is a great starter book, and for those novice witchs out there this gives a basic understanding of the why's and how's, along with basic teachings of what is needed. It was also nice to see the way the book was formed form the beginning (the history of witchcraft) to the end (basic spells). All in all I put my hands together again for the teachings of Raymond Buckland."
4,Living Wicca,"This book is a very good primer on how to practice witchcraft as a religion and magical system. If you've read one of the ""wicca 101"" books, you've read them all. By the definitions laid here I would be a solitary witch and legitimately. This is one of the books I had seen in stores as a teenager that caught my attention when I first got into witchcraft as a teenager. I would say to get started practicing wicca this is easily one of the best books on it that gives explanations of the different tools of the trade. And more importantly it shows the student how to make their own equipment. Though these days you can get better quality items that will last a long time and still look new on online occult shops."
4,Good study guide.,"This book is a study guide for witchcraft and as such it is an excellent book for the novice witch, however the title is misleading. This book is a very good primer but it is anything but complete."
4,A WITCH LIBRARY!,"Every witch needs a LIBRARY! This book is a must have. This was my first witchcraft book. It is a Text book on witchcraft. It read like a text book and that is the only reason I give it 4 stars. There are six books I think every Witch has to have in there library 1. Scott Cunningham Wicca A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner 2. Scott Cuningham Living Wicca A Further Guide For the Solitary Practitioner 3. Slver Ravenwolf To Ride A Silver Broomstick 4. Silver RavenWolf To Stir A Magick Cauldron 5. Silver RavenWolf To Light A Sacred Flame and 6. RAYMOND BUCKLAND BUCKLAND'S COMPLETE BOOK OF WITCHCRAFT. After I have read Scott Cunningham books on Witchcraft I picked up Mr. Buckland book and I enjoyed it the second time around. I have bought most of Raymond Buckland work and love them all mostly his Gypsy books. I just take what I need and forget the rest. Be an ECLECTIC witch. There are more than just one Kind of Witch (Celtic, Gypsy, Egyptian,Native American and ETC...."
4,A Wonderful Beginner Book,This was the very first book I ever read on Paganism and Witchcraft. I still refer to it every once in a while. I reccommend this book over Scott Cunningham anyday!
4,good book so far,what is this about it being all fake just to make money? i certainly hope not. it has been a good one so far--its helped
3,"Not complete, but still useful.","This book is a greatlook at a particular sect(Seax-wicca), but as a look at wicca as a whole, no. Now don't get me wrong, the beginner's section is great, and there are a few rites that have merit for use, but to call a book on a particular sect ""complete"" smacks slightly of egotism."
1,Worthless Reading,What a lot of horse puckey! Surely people in the craft know that this in made up to sell more of this writers books. Well even his newest wife has one out. If one can't make a believer out of you (to spend your money) the other is trying the children's market with spells. Get a life Bucky. Most of us MALES know that you don't got a day job YO! This book is to sell sell sell! All the Pagan communities know about you now.
3,good choice,"good book, very informative, but it is set up like a workbook to wicca and i dont really like that. The language is kind of dull. I would not recommened this for beginners!"
4,"Well-rounded, and informative...","I bought this book in a shop near NYC. I didn't like it at first because it was black and white and it wasn't covered with pictures. Colorful pictures may be the only thing that this book is lacking. It gives an abundance of information on almost everything you can think of. The author doesn't go abysmally deep into the subjects, but for a really well-rounded book, this is definately a must-have for a first time (and older, maybe twenties) witch. The lack of color threw me off when I was younger, but now that I look at it (I am older now), it has so much information, that I can get a lot out of it!!"
5,excellent reading,Great book. It was easy to understand and went into detail on all things it contained. It had practical excerises which ensured all was understand. Especially helpful to those new to the world of wicca.
2,Not recommendable for beginning Solitary practioners,"This is the first book I read on the Craft, and I wish it wasn't. All of the rituals in this book can only be done if you are in a coven. Granted there is a very short section discussing solitaries, but it's useless. Fortunately I had purchased another book from Scott Cunningham for beginners. There is better understanding and he doesn't force his opinion on you as Buckland does."
1,"""Complete"" If You Happen To Be Raymond Buckland","Nevermind all the hulabaloo that surrounds a Big Name Pagan. Buckland's full of himself and a lot of other stuff, too, and this comes across in the pages of this book. For starters, it is the most pompous and boring book on the Craft I have ever read. His ""style"" is stiff with an almost touch-me-not aura. Let me also point out that this is no book on general witchcraft. It is a tome on the brand of the Craft Buckland invented himself, Seax Wicca, and won't be every witch's cup of brew. I'm always amazed at how any book on the Craft can lack passion, and this is the most passionless out there. Should I even mention the ritual bondage associated with initiation? Symbolism, sure. Bondage is bondage and has no place in a practice where all are equal. Read this if you must but please supplement it with other more liberal renderings of the Craft."
4,High Standards,"This book was given to me as a gift by someone who had no clue what she had. Her exact words were, ""this is weird so I thought you'd like it.""Heh, now look what she's started.Anyway, I do like this book very much. As with pretty much everything in life I don't agree completely with Mr. Buckland or feel that it offers me ""everything I need to know"" it has been a valuable asset to my learning.I've seen a lot of comments about Buckland's high handed writing style that seems to talk down to the readers, but I didn't actually get that impression.It seemed to me like he has high standards for the people reading his book and that's actually more comforting to me than many of the new wave ""I'm your buddy, let me hold your hand through this big scary word"" form of writing.Blathering aside, I reccomend this highly to everyone just starting out as well as those who've been at it a while but have been intimidated by the author's steadfast opinions on what he considers truth."
4,great read,This is a great starter book for anybody starting off in the craft. For covens or solitary this book gives facts and understanding about the religon as well as ritiuals for sabbats and some basic spells. I was recomended this book and I have continued to recomend it to others.
4,easy read & informative,"A practitioner recommended this to me as an introduction. Very easy to follow and has lessons at the end of each chapter to test your retention & comprehension. The only reason I'm not doing 5 stars is that some images are unlabeled and I had a few ""why"" questions that were unanswered that, I felt, would have aided complete understanding. Other than that if you are looking for a place to start... this is it."
3,A great reference,"I started my path into Wicca using this book and I can say that while it does have some great ""technical"" aspects and loads of useful information it does not really help you to get in touch with the spiritual aspects of the religion. HOWEVER with that said this should be in every Coven/Solitary bookshelf along with Mr Cunningham."
4,A great Wicca 101 text,"The book covers all aspects of Wicca. If used with other books on Wicca like To Ride A Silver Broomstick it makes a great basis for learning Wicca. Not everyone will agree with all that is said - but all the topics covered, should be covered by the beginner. People who are looking for books of Spells and Rituals are not interested in learning Wicca. This book gives many of the tools needed to become a Witch."
2,Hmm,"I read this book when I first started out on Wicca. I didn't like it that much, but there is some usefull info in it. If this book helped you, more power to ya, but when I was starting out it just confused me more. lol"
3,Good refrence book,"Buckland did a good job squeezing alot of info into one book and is definitly an investment. Though he does overemphasize his own tradition. If your just starting out as a wiccan then your best bet is to pick up a book by Scott Cunningham. Remember, wicca is a very personal religion and all that you read is from an individuals point of view that may differ from your own.If a book contains the words ""'an it harm none, do what thy will"" Then your headed in the right direction. Blessed Be"
3,It could have been better.,"The book to me could have been a little more open to other crafts other than seax-wiccan, but if that is all he knows then that is all he can write about. It was very informative if you want to be in a coven and want to study seax-wiccan. but it did provide a good, if boring, history lesson."
1,A One Star Rating Is Too Kind,"I don't like this book, Buckland is so full of himself it's not even funny. No wonder so many people call it ""Bucklands Big Blue Book of BS""!!"
1,Egotistical and Overbearing,Raymond bucland is an egotistical author claiming it was him that brought witchcraft to america. This book is terrible for a begginer and you should avoid it like the plague. if your goal is to form a facsit coven then this should be your handbook. you are better off with scott cunningham. the only good book by buckland is practical candle burning.
1,BLAHH,"That pretty much sums it up for me. I do not like this book, and glad I did NOT buy it. I borrowed it from a friend and could only stand reading it for a little while. Its dry, boring and not any help IMO. Nor is it a ""complete"" guide, no such thing in ONE book. If you like boring books that make you fall asleep, by all means, buy it..LOL~Blessings~"
2,Proceed with Caution,"Buckland was one of the first people to really bring awareness to the Craft in the United States. Unfortunately, he was also ludicrously egotistical. This book's ""History"" section is a lie from beginning to end---Craft practicioners need to realize that their religion is not thousands of years old or some secret handed-down tradition from generation to generation. We're new, folks. Deal with it.Buckland is also, if I may quote my good friend Sannion here, ""nauseatingly self-referential"". You'll find he quotes his own books far more often than any even remotely modest human being would, and he often goes into an extremely dismissive tone when talking about anything that isn't directly related to his interpretation of the craft.The herbal section might help you out, as could the rituals, but I recommend avoiding this thing like the plague if you've got a more than basic understanding of Wicca."
2,If I would have known...,"If I had known how focused this book was on Buckland's tradition, I would not have bought it. I was looking for an intro, like the page described. Students who truly are at the introductory level should not herded to one tradition. Cunningham's book is much better if you don't want to be one of Buckland's sheep."
5,Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft,"This book is very educational.. explains alot of miths.. and is also a work book so you can track your progress in learning the craft.. Excellent purchase and well worth it. If you are serious about learning information on the Craft, it is a must have book."
5,Buckland is great,"I have always thought of Buckland as a good writer and this book did not disappoint me. I bought it for a new member to my circle and they agreed that it was very helpful as a beginners guide. And that's really what it is, it's a guide and overview of the practice for newcomers. it is not intended to teach you everything there is to know about the practice. You need to find some one to teach you if that is your goal! But all in all this is a great resource and I keep a copy on my shelves."
3,Good Reference Book,"This was the first book I picked up on my Wiccan journey. It was a pretty dry read. That being said, I found it to be a great reference/resource book. I often find myself skimming the pages for info."
4,Great Range,"This book covers an excellent range of topics and in my opinion is a must for any serious student of Wicca. By no means is the book a tell all know all book. However it is an excellent introduction to many topics that witches should become familiar with.The only things that keep me from giving this book 5 stars is the fact that it left me wanting more information . . . which could have been included to make one huge volume. I certainly would not have minded a larger presentation in this book, especially considering Buckland's scholarly approach. The only other thing that kept this book from getting 5 stars was Buckland's constant mentioning of his own tradition of Saxon Wicca. It almost seemed as if he was pushing it. And in a way, you can't blame him if he was.Bottom line is that this is an excellent, well rounded book giving great introductory information on various topics."
4,COOL BEGINNER'S BOOK ON WITCHCRAFT,Buckland's book is a cool beginner's book on witchcraft. He covers a great deal of territory in this resource book. I bought Sirona Knight's book Empowering Your Life with Wicca just before I bought this one and the two books are perfect complements to one another. Buckland's book is more traditional and Knight's is more New Age. I think everybody who wants to get into Wicca would find Buckland's book (and Knight's book) useful and very helpful. This is the kind of book you can refer to over and over.
1,Outdated,"This book was writen many years ago to introduce people to the Gardnerian Tradition of Wicca - even the title of Bucklands book is misleading! This book CAN BE of use for everyone interested in the Gardnerian or Alexandrian Tradition of Wicca. If you look for ""basic training"" and good beginners books - look elswhere!The book is outdated and much to complicated!"
1,He just keeps reprinting it!,"Doesn't matter that Wicca's best thinkers chucked all ideas about ""The Olde Religion"" years ago, he just keeps reprinting his so-called ""history"" chapter. How can I take seriously a book or author that has no more respect for its readers than that?"
3,Not impressed.,I feel that this book is written well for a beginning pagan student but for my taste I prefer something a little less dry. I have been studying for 11 years now and when I bought this book I kicked myself because I felt like a twelve year old discovering my rebellious side.
2,nothing special,"i dont understand why everyone,thinks this book is oh so wonderful. imo it sucked. yes he covers alot of ground,but he doesnt teach you enough about anything,he acts like his tradition is the only tradition of wicca. plus is too full of himself,now being proud of your accompolishments is one thing but thinking you are the best thing in the craft is another."
3,Good for beginners,"By the time this book was written, Ramond has strayed from straight Garderian and had become more Saxon-Witch, Picti-Witch. Its evidence is all over this book. It is a good book for people to learn some of the basics of witchcraft but it has no real investement in the religion itself. It a good teaching book."
5,Great book,"i highly reccomend this book. i didn't have it when i started out, and i wish i had. it covers all the fundementals with good detail while still letting the reader shape the religion to him/herself."
3,Book Reviews,"Well personally I was sent this book by Raymond Buckland many moons ago. It is what allowed me to open my mind to various misinformation that had been put out in media forms by the Christian religions pertaining to Paganism etc. As a result of this particular book I began my own research, questioning many Christian doctrines. Had I not been given this book, I might still be wallowing around in guilt and self pity about life. But I am not! So, I of course would recommend it to anyone who feels afraid to venture out into their own search. I suppose these reviews all simply depend on what one is seeking in their life. I gave it a three because I believe that is an average. I think four is for outstanding and five is for the Pulitzer :)"
3,Very valuable read if you are already a Wiccan,"This book would be of great value for people who have already decided to follow the Wiccan path, have read several books before and have clear thoughts and beliefs on Wicca. Otherwise, it can be very misleading. Having lots of historical information, helpful hints on rituals and useful tips for effectiveness on magic working, it is still too technical and can make the unexpert believe that there is no other way to be a Wiccan than Buckland's. He is wise, but narrow-minded at the same time. If it were possible to write two different reviews for this book, I would rate it 5 stars for Wiccans and 1 star for non-Wiccans. Great book. Just read it at the proper moment."
5,Everything you need to know to practice the craft.,Before reading this book I knew very little about the craft. Now I have uncovered abilities I never knew that I had. I enjoy being a witch and would like to thank Buckland for such an informative piece.
3,A good reference,"Yes, Uncle Bucky's Big Blue Book of Witches is a good reference book, but the Farrars' Witches' Bible is much better. If you are interested in learning Seax Wicca (not Gardenarian, as some have suggested), then it's a pretty good reference. If you want to learn Gardenarian, find a Gardenarian. If you claim to be a Third degree of any sort after completing this book, people will laugh at you. A book is no replacement for a qualified teacher."
5,blue gold for wiccans,"this is a masterpiece for those wanting to practice wicca or if your just curious about the craft everything is covered from history of the craft to breaking the news it not only proves that were not devil-worshippers but shows that wicca is a very respectible religion that has morals, ethics and promotes spiritual growth basically this book is blue gold for wiccan's"
4,The first Beginners book that I actually liked,"Finally someone with something positive to say to those who are just starting. In terms of beginners books, this is at the opposite end of the spectrum from $ilver Ravenwolf. He doesn't offer the advanced secrets, but does show you what it is to be a Wiccan Witch.He manages to artfully thread the line between revealing too much (oathbound) and revealing too little (Cunningham) and avoids making stuff up to fill pages ($ilver). This would be an excellent primer to anybody who wants to be a witch but hasn't found any in their area yet. I do recommend it."
2,Magical me,"I bought this book years ago when I was first interested in paganism and alternate religions. The writing is egotistical, pompous and condescending . On reading ""The chamber of secrets"" a couple years after I was convinced J.K. Rowling was having an inside joke by including a character such as Gilderoy Lockhart - It is just the epitome of Buckland. He is a bit too much of ""My way is the only way"" - to the point he quotes his own books.I gave it 2 stars as there is some good information in it - but it is far from complete. The parts on blindfolding, binding, and hanging certainly did not appeal; and the insistence that one needed a numerologically correct practicing name was a bit childish'"
3,Good for the beginner,"This was one of my first books on witchcraft and I thought it was great when i got it home from the store and started to read it and do the questions at the end of each chapter. Now, almost a decade later that I look back I see it was a great stepping stone to get me started but has too many practices of Wicca to be useful. Some examples being how people do not need tools to practice magic(it is all in the mind), not to use circles but sheilds (since entities get pissed off at circles)and many other things. I am more evolved now in spirit from other sources than this book however, this book was on of the first to help me on my way and is a good reference book as well."
5,Bucklands Complete Book of WitchCraft,"This book is Wonderful reads, it teaches from lesson 1 with a very user friendly format. I enjoyed this book very much, and I think it's a Great Book for the beginner. I rate this book over-all 5 Stars."
2,Not quite worth it,"This book gets a lot of publicity, and it would deserve it if it were the only book of its kind out there. But it isn't. This book has a pretty good section on making an athame, and everything else you can find in tons of other books explained a LOT better. The author does a good job of remaining impartial to any religious viewpoint, but as a result the book is no more than an information pamphlet written by a disinterested, unimaginative, and sometimes not very thorough author. I don't recommend this book for anyone actually trying to look at ""Witchcraft"" and get a feeling for what it is. This book doesn't do that at all. It just gives a lot of techniques that, in my opinion, don't really work that well."
1,Wake Me When It's Over.,"Buckland's too full of himself to give the subject an appropriate treatment. And besides, ritual binding and blindfolding? No, thank you."
3,Good Begineer Book,"I don't know many long time, non-family trad Witches who didn't cut some teeth on this book. It's a good mixture of history, practice and theory. The book is lacking, and even the Wiccan newbie will soon find themselves wanting more. Good light read, but if you're just entering your path to Wicca or Witchcraft, do yourself a favor and buy Spiral Dance or Drawing Down the Moon with this book to satisfy some other needs."
4,"Not complete, but pretty darn informative","I really enjoyed this book. It was set up very well, the information (excluding the history in the beginning) was wonderful, and manner it was presented in was very forthright and easy to understand.I particularly enjoyed the lack of waffling and the fact that the author genuinely believes in what he writes. If I read one more book on witchcraft that has an author second guessing themselves in the name of political (or religious, I suppose) correctness, I'm going to scream.Luckily, with this book, I am scream free.Great for beginners but must be followed up with other books on witchcraft. (As with all books on the craft, really...)"
2,Claims to be more than what it is,"This was one of those books which I had very high expectations for, but found very disappointing. I will say that it is better than most introductory books, and I do like the workbook aspect. However, the historical and theological information is just plain wrong. Buckland attempts an intellectual approach to Wicca, but ends up creating a work that is not nearly as intelligent as advertised."
4,A must for someone who needs basic knowledge of the craft,"This book gave us the insite that we needed. It was the first book that we read, and gave us the knowledge to get started. It a must for someone needing the basic knowledge of the craft."
2,Okay for reference sometimes,"As a solitary practitioner (and a beginner at the time), I didn't find much of anything useful in this book. I occaisionally go back to it for historical references, or to look at some of his holiday rites, but I haven't used it much at all. I also didn't appreciate the emphasis Buckland places on the necessity of tools, or the formality of his rites."
2,Welcome To Buckland 101,"This book is dry, flat, and quite boring. Buckland droans on like a stale college professor. If information about witchcraft is what your after steer clear of this book. His rituals and most information is geared for covens and not solitaries. Needless to say if you need a sedative, this will do the trick"
1,WTF?,Since when did gc deserve a tribute album? This sucks so bad i'd rather stab my own ba||s than listen to this. This would be over-priced if it were free!!!!
1,Dont buy this,This tribute sucks! It is so horrible. The dudes singing dont sound near as good as joel n benji n they cant sing worth a crap. I dont know how amazon can sell this. I think they should burn every copy of it!
1,This is (...)hallerious!!!!!!!!!!,"If me and my friends were making an album mocking good charlotte? This is how it would sound exectly, and thats why its so damn funny...Maiby after gc listing to their album ""tribute to good charlotte""they'll see how dumb and gay they sound and actullie stop making music ? I hope so!I mean, with lirycs like ""im mad at my mother"" how do you expect to be taken sirious ? The one star for making me laugh tho. Still, do not buy it unles you feel like laughing your ass off."
2,why dont i have an alliance with a parcel?,it makes me happy and thats what matters but i must say that if these guys are serious they need to get a new job/hobby/thing. its very funny thou......they remind me of weird al except much worse.
3,Horribly funny!,"Some of the songs on this sounds like they're sung by cartoon characters!It made me laugh and cringe at the same time.I think this is a good comedy album.I feel bad for those 'United Punks Of America'.Well, I give this album 1 star as a tribute, but 5 stars as a parody."
1,sounds like drunk old men!,omg this sucks! and i just listened to a few seconds of it! they sler (prolly spelled wrong sorry) their words together and on the anthem they sound like drunk old men! ugh get a life and stop being gc wannabe's! cuz ya can't replace the original who is the best! luv ya joel!
1,bull$h!t,"ok, some of good charlottes music isn't too bad, and i'm not going to go and call them posers, but come on. they've released two albums and they get a tribute album? i'm a big punk fan, and while gc isn't true punk, they've had a few good songs (despite some of them being overplayed). two albums does not warrant a tribute album though, save it for the bands who deserve it, and maybe a tribute album will come after 7 or 8 albums, but not 2."
1,holy crap that sucked,"I'm a hardcore GC fan, I have all their albums...and this ""tribute"" seriously sucked. They totally mutilated some great songs, like Screamer, Lifestyles, and the Young and The Hopeless...A lo0t of other people said they laughed, i didn't laugh, because THIS SUCKED.don't waste your money on this."
1,is this supposed to be funny?,"wow, i don't know if they intended this to be funny. and i thought joel madden had a slightly nasal voice. this guy is scary. he's possibly one of the worst singers i've ever heard. it sounds kind of beatles-ish somehow, expect maybe more like the beatles from hell, if you know what i mean. he totally mutilated ""screamer"" and i love that song. i'm a big GC fan and have all their CDs except the Death Art version of Chronicles. This CD is just awful...does anybody like it? i wouldn't even call it a tribute! ha, don't waste your money, kids."
1,Could it get any worse?!,"Gosh! I didn't even BUY the CD and I think it sucks! It makes me cringe just listening to the samples! Whoever did this, just, don't tributize anything again... Please, it's for you're own good. Omigod, I just... I didn't think Good Charlotte songs could sound bad, not even a little bad, but God, this CD proves me wrong. I hope Good Charlotte didn't buy this and then listen to it, maybe they burnt it. Hopefully they burnt it... Music sounds way better when you get the ACTUAL CD from the ACTUAL band. Don't buy this, it doesn't sound right. Buy Good Charlotte or The Young and The Hopeless, their AUTHENTIC albums."
1,do not buy this,"this cd is sh*t i feel sorry for good charlotte coz they have these ppl trying to sing there ace song. i cant beleave that sum1 can make good charlotte songs soooooooooooooooo sound bad, DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!"
1,Way bad,I listened to the recording and it sounds like a bunch of sh!+! I CAN SING THE SONGS WAAAYYYY BETTER THAN THAT! Dont buy it I REPEAT DONT BUY IT!
1,DO NOT GET IT!,Ahhhhh unfortunitely I brought it from Bestbuy w/o hearing a single song. The band who sings these songs have turned all of these wonderful G.C. songs into BAD songs. The lead singer's voice is so nasally that it just makes me cringe thinking about it. I don't listen to it at all and I just brought it yesterday it was THAT bad. You think G.C.'s not all that punk yet...well these bands turn these songs into the weird pop music song that was once heard in the 80s! So it's not even the right generation of pop music. Overall I just have to say it's def. not worth your money...DON'T BUY it...I regret havin' done so....:(
1,Holy......,Just listening to the clips made me want to throw up....how could they do this to good charlotte and release something so low......dont waste your time OR money.
1,Waste of Money,"I thought that this so called Tribute to Good Charlotte would have bands like Simple Plan and NFG singing Good Charlottes songsThe lady that sings on this cd has horrible vocals and it sounds weird hearing a girl say This girls, a hott girl, a riot girl and she's takin on the world I would not reccomend this cd to anyone because it is a piece of junk. This so called cover band can not sing cover songs by groups like GC.Hey Joel, Benji, Chris, Paul and Billy Sorry that people are trying to be like you also known as trying to pose as GC."
1,What are they thinking,Seriously I feel bad for these people. I love my GC boys but this was almost an insult to them...sorry to be so harsh.
1,Ha Ha Ha............................,"I tried listening to this CD and the first thing that came to mind was""Why the heck did I buy this?"" I listened to the songs and 'The Anthem' singer sounded like a Baha Man wanna be . The others sounded like British Punk-Rockers singing. Who would dedicate this crap to GC? But it's as funny as listening to the ""William Hung"" CD .......................Ha Ha Ha"
1,this cd sucks so bad its not even funny,i got it as a gift for christmas and wanted to puke when i listened to it good charlotte is awesome but the people singing tthis suck DO NOT BUY IT!!! PLEASE!!! ugh it sucks so bad
1,...wow...,All I can say is that this had SO better be a joke... even the clips here on Amazon make me want to cry because of how horribly ruined GC's songs are!
2,Missing piece to hold the scissors together,My scissors came without the black circle to hold them together. I didn't realize that was the problem - only that the two parts wouldn't stay together - until it was too late to return them. So I've always had to try to hold them together to use them - not very practical!
5,great gift for people who have almost everything & cook,"Especially for people who cook alot (live to eat, rather than eat to live), these scissors are a fantastic gift. I have given at least a dozen pairs as wedding or house-warming gifts. I have had mine for eight years & they are still razor-sharp. I reach for them a dozen times each day. These would be a welcome gift for a valued staff member or an appreciated teacher, as the holidays approach. I couldn't live without mine."
3,Poor Quality,"I used them the first time, and the insidw blades were left with stains when I cut tape on a bag of lettuce, and cutting open a bag of tortillas. These are supposed to be stain resistant, and they aren't."
4,The Astonishing Roberta Peters,"What a pleasure to see this peerless diva perform -- she is the purest example of her art that I have ever known. Like a great actress, she dissolves into her role, and yet her voice and style are easily recognizable for the effortless simplicity with which she nails every note and figure. I wish they could have taped in color in those days, and I would have liked to see her perform more examples of the coloratura repertoire and less of the popular romantic themes. Overall, I am delighted with this video."
2,Catchy...,"...but that's where the positives end for Petey Pablo's joint, ""Freek-a-Leek"". Petey Pablo basically fits in the ""Just another MC from the south"" category, and although he has a distinctive voice and flow, his lyrics leave a lot to be desired. The beat and hook of this song is basically what makes it catchy, but it certainly got old real quick. The uninspired video doesn't help the song much either, but it's still a catchy, if sub-par, track."
3,Anthony Boucher's Far & Away,"This is the 2nd Boucher anthology that I've bought from Amazon - The Complete Werewolf was the first & perhaps the best. There are a couple of overlapping stories, but both are a must have for anyone who enjoys the sci-fantasy-mystery short stories that Boucher penned so well. Similar in some ways to some of the short stories of A E Van Vogt, Frank Belknap Long, Henry Kuttner & Abraham Merritt...a great ""fun"" read...with some macabre twists that make these anything but bland reading.In terms of condition of the copy I purchased...its a vintage copy that needs care...but it gives that vintage quality that adds something to the reading experience!"
5,Favorite Negro Problem Album,"This is my favorite of The Negro Problem CDs.Stew & the gang always provide catchy music with interesting lyrics, but this collection has some of their strongest work.""Miss Jones"" is an evocative slice-of-life that wildly transcends the depth of meaning that you'd expect from a pop song. But it's not alone -- ""Doubting Uncle Tom,"" ""Ghetto Godot,"" ""Meaning of Everything,"" ... well, the majority of the tracks on this collection are not just fun music, but convey a great deal more. The CD is the experiential equivalent of simultaneously reading a collection of philosophical short stories and having a BBQ/summer dance with your friends on the sun-killed grass of some poorly-maintained Los Angeles park."
3,more than a week late,"ordered the product early january, received it more than a week after the deadline of feb 2, product was fine, it just took way too long to arrive."
1,Garbage,"This disc came out of my machine and went right into the garbage, where it belongs. Every single thing about this movie was lame, especially Mark whoever he is... And all the other reviewers on here really need to get lives if they think this crap was so spectacular."
4,movie lover,Really thought this movie would be about a ghost but it's really about memories. I have to admit this is one sad movie. If you like a sad movie you will like this one. Just stick with it from the start.
4,Ditko - Genius at work,"So many fans only think of Dr. Strange and Spider-Man when they think of Ditko, but he had a prolific career illustrating horror and science fiction comics in the 1950's. This is a great book, with crisp b&w linework and good production values. These stories show Ditko already in polished form even before his early 60's monster books and super hero work, which finally earned him his renown. This is simply an excellent book."
4,Works with Windoze,"I bought one of these, new, for the price of a couple of McD's meals, and it's allowed me to bring a small wireless ""modem"" (from my ISP) into work, hook it up to an aging, otherwise stand-alone laptop I had gathering dust at home, and get good, private Internet access (on my own time) *without* connecting through my company's network, creating any security issues or bringing down the wrath of my corporate LAN-Lords. It's not the fastest thing around, but it is reliable on every Microsoft OS from W98 on - and maybe earlier ones, too. W2K supports it directly, so it's essentially ""plug and play"" on my old laptop.I'd give it five stars if it handled 1000TX too, or worked flawlessly with Macs - but right now neither is necessary. And the price was right."
1,Dead on arrival,"DOA out of the unopened box. These things happen, but since it was only $5, it wasn't worth the time and money to return it."
2,Sub-Standard Quality for OTC,"When it arrived, this set was labeled as ""OTC Stinger"" not ""OTC"". While I can't confirm it anywhere, the Stinger subsidiary of OTC appears to be OTC's home mechanic (read ""cheap"") line of tools. (Perhaps similar to the BluePoint line that SnapOn sells.) It's manufactured in Taiwan, not the US. The kit includes a 2"" and a 3"" splitter, but they are not the OTC 1122 and OTC 1123 splitters. Both the OTC 1122 and 1123 splitters are made in the US. The difference in quality is very apparent. The splitters in this kit have high porosity castings and the ""knife edges"" on the splitters are clearly inferior to those on the ""made in the US"" OTC 1122 and 1123 splitters. This may be perfectly adequate for ""loose"" tolerance bearings, but maybe not. I'm not willing to find out and the kit will be returned."
2,"Broken, no help.","Quality looks decent enough.I only used this tool once and a puller arm broke at the threaded section.OTC warranty period is 1 year, so i was SOL on the return.The cost of the replacement part I need is almost as much as the complete set from Amazon.I have a few OTC tools and always liked them, but this one has me a little sour."
3,Taiwan Butter Steel,"Course threads on the shaft, thats bad. BUTTER STEEL, Works on light duty stuff, the splitters are better quality, good luck, bent some parts 1st time used on fairly light pull. NOT ORIGINAL OTC QUALITY, we, as a country import to much junk, key word there!!!!!!!!!"
1,I returned it.,"This product is made in Taiwan and the steel quality is VERY poor. The edges that are supposed to sperate the bearing from the axle started to mash over before the bearing even started to move, and I had heated the bearing a bit before I started as well, don't waste your time or money."
5,Cute kitten!,We got this adorable stuffed cat for our almost 2 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it! She carries it around all day and sleeps with it at night. Did I mention it's really cute?!
2,good for sinatra fans,"This is entertaining, but not very interesting. Some of the dialogue is really lame. It's cool if you're a Sinatra fan, though. Frank is a criminal who started off on this path because he had a bad childhood or something..You know, a criminal with issues. His character seems to like hurting and killing people out of curiousity, though, so it's alright when he's not going on about his past. Also, he or one of the other characters talks about the moon landing in the future (it's '54, so it hasn't happened yet, of course). So that was kind of cool."
1,Warning: NOT the 1973 film!,"According to the Anthem Pictures website, this is ""a bittersweet dramatic comedy about friendships, insecurities, rites of passage and the death of idealism. Corbin Bernsen (L.A. Law) is featured as Alex's father, forced to drop everything to come bail the kids out of trouble and Michael Jackson (Newsradio 1070 AM) provides a documentary-style narration drawn from the Desmond Morris book by the same name.""This is NOT the rare Johnny Crawford 1973 film, more's the pity, but a cheesy coming-of-age flick from 2006 (see IMDB for more info)."
1,Never got it!!,"I never got it! Waste of money, its as simple as that. You might as well flush your money down the toilet."
1,Boring waste of time,"This book focused on two Jewish boys, and their tyrant parents. There was not one part that interested me fromt the beginning to the end. This is a colossal waste of time, and unless you are in a hospital bed, I DO NOT reccomend this book. As a student, I have other things to do than read a book that uses Jewish terms that 1% of the population understands. If you HAVE to read this for school, do yourself a favor and buy the Cliff Notes.This book drags on & on, and is WAY too descriptive."
3,Okay then!,"This episode is certainly imaginative, but it's also *super* campy. I realize it's supposed to be, considering the style this episode is trying to parody, but Voyager is already certainly campy enough. Just... skip to the next one."
2,Broken!,Just received season 5. Opened up package and plastic casing smashed up. So buyer beware! You would think at the price they charge for each season they would at least spend an extra buck or two on protective casing. Well I guess I'll find out if DVD's are scratched once I start watching them!
2,Bad Episode,"I've been going through these old Voyager episodes, and though I don't usually leave comments, I thought I would leave behind a note that I wish someone would have left me:Skip this episode. It is really bad."
5,Excellent,One of the best...you must see even if you are not fan of Star Trek. Writing and directing are excellent.
1,Waiting for response from seller,When I received this set it contained no Disk #2 and 2 Disk #5s. I have e-mailed the seller to see if they will rectify the situation and I'm waiting for their response.
1,Oblivious oblivion,"This episode started off exciting, though climaxed far too early, only to plateau and not recover. While the first few minutes captivate, the remaining episode lacks any stimulus to keep entertained. Spoiler alert, in the end this ""false"" ship is all for naught, it disintegrates and nothing is lost, except for the 45 minutes you spent watching it."
4,Great product!!,The DVD set was in great condition and nothing was wrong with it!! We received it in a timely fashion!!
2,Disc 4 is defective,"Disc 4 is defective, lost entire episode, have to buy replacement disc. The rest of disc are fine. Wish the companies would check product before it ships fore defects"
4,"Well done, really charming","I liked this one a lot. It progressed really s-l-o-w-l-y, although that's probably because every other Voyager episode seems to rush by, as though the writers try to cram as much into one episode as possible. This is the exception -- that one track on an album by your favorite band that chooses to abandon the usual worn-out song structure in favor of a more free-form style. Here we have another representation of 20th-century history, but this isn't ""Future's End"" where the writers make a point to juxtapose the futuristic Voyager crew against the weird 20th-century Earth-dwellers. Instead, this episode plays out like Janeway's holonovel (or ""Remember"" way back in Season 3). It's like a short story -- you're given a window into a larger world. Obviously it's still a TV show and not a movie, so the window is really small, but I thought it was well done enough that you can use your imagination to fill in the rest. Needless to say, I was engrossed."
4,It's 4/5 good but it's not 5/5 OMG AWESOME PERFECT,"I think all the perfect 5 out of 5s are an indication of just how rare it is when a Voyager episode isn't predictable (I smell desperation). It's a solid story, but c'mon...it pales in comparison to truly great episodes like ""Timeless"", ""Drone"", and ""One"". Up until now the crew and the captain just blindly trust every stranger they meet (predictably leading to them getting royally screwed over) but this time somehow they pull a sherlock holmes and they finally outsmart the bad guys....it only took 120 episodes, but Janeway did it. YOU GO GURL! PARTY TIME!*SPOILER*Janeway kisses just how you'd think....like watching a person kiss a wall."
4,Starfleet in the Delta Quandrant,"Much to Voyager's surprise, there is another Starfleet vessel in the Delta Quandrant. This ship however is far from following Starfleet rules.The idea that there is a limit to how far your ideals will carry you was brought up and tested in Deep Space Nine so its nice to see it here. What if Voyoger didn't have the resources it had, what might they become? what might they do? Captain Ransom and his crew answer that question nicely."
4,"Tom, the hero","Tom Paris disobeys orders and is sentenced to the brig for 30 days. Why, because he was doing what was right.This episode advances Tom's character considerably because we see someone who was out for himself actually risk his life to benefit others. There is nothing in it for him and, succeed or fail, he was going to be in trouble.Also, this gives Trek an opportunty to show that they really do leave people alone. They provided help when asked, and even though further help is needed they let the aliens hang themselves. This sounds bad, but since the Prime Directive says don't interfere, they didn't. It's also nice to see someone punished. It is unreasonable to expect everyone to be good ALL the time, and there must be some levels of existence between Starfleet obidience and full on traitor."
4,"Predictable, but also touching...","This episode is about lil Miss Wildman and her Mother; it's a bit mushy, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Two things surprised me about this episode as well:1. The little girl playing Naomi impressed me; convincing acting, she was funny, and of course adorable2. The childish holoprogram was goofy and entertaining, like a Pixar or Disney film is...it's meant for kids but it can still be enjoyed by adults too.This one is very much standalone, but I still recommend watching it."
3,Was that a season premiere?,"First and second act were fantastic, but as usual it all falls apart a the end. At about the 36 minute mark things get ridiculous and that leads to the inevitable abrupt ending with no resolution. For a season premiere I would be a bit ashamed to air this on TV...it definitely wouldn't have hooked me and it didn't get me excited for the rest of the season.And the bizarre side story with Janeway feeling guilt and attempting self-sacrifice is just silly and out of place. She did made a HUGE mistake in the very first episode, but now is not the time and place to deal with that; you're a captain....LEAD THE DAMN SHIP! Don't throw yourself a self-pity parade."
3,Banana Pancakes,"The major player here is B'Elanna, in fact the entire episode is all about her. As I finished this episode I felt that I could have skipped it and not missed a thing, but maybe that's because I can't relate to clinical depression or PTSD...I've been lucky enough to never have experienced either. Or maybe it's cause these kinda of stories make me feel depressed :\*minor spoilers ahead*What I don't understand: She heard the bad news about the Maquis a long time ago...so why is it only NOW affecting her attitude? Seems like the writers wanted to retroactively shoe-horn this type of story in..."
1,"WHERE IS ""IN AMERICA""???","How can this be the ""Ultimate"" collection when it omits one of Charlie's biggest country and pop hits? Thanks, but I'll stick with his 14-track ""Essential"" disc. That's all I have to say about this. Thank you"
2,I think I would like it.,"I think I would have liked it but CD 1 wouldn't work in any of my Cd players. Now CD 2 was great, just wished I could have heard #1. Ol'Charlie can play. It's my own fault I don't go thru all the BS to get it exchanged. Does make me think twice about buying on line. Tag,1 for their team."
1,won't buy- displeased,"Iam rather displeased to see that the material used to make the cabbage patch kids' hair has been replaced. The Yarn hair was one of the only features that was the same throughout, and in my opinion, the best feature ever. Now I will not buy a cabbage patch doll for my child. I cannot find what I want with yarn hair!!!"
4,Great Educational DVD,My family have watched this movie three times already and my grandkids adored the characters. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone with children. Great animation and easy for kids to follow. Hope to see more stories with Andy..
4,"Good performance, but noisy",I purchased this 8 port gigabit switch to do parallel computing. The setup is easy and it works reliably. The only thing I dislike is the noise made by its cooling fan. It is a little bit too noisy
3,"Not for me, perhaps it's for you.","If you like Barley Tea, than perhaps this is great, I've never had any but this and thought it would be nice to try. The price was right, I simply didn't enjoy the tea."
5,"Yummy, nutty, instant iced tea!","This iced tea is very yummy. Slightly nutty, roasted flavor. I love coffee and this is a great instant tea for coffee drinkers. I've also read that Barley tea is good for your skin, in addition to preventing tooth decay and helping with your heart health as well. I can put the tea bag in a glass, fill it up with water, and continue refilling all day and still get delicious tea."
5,Drums & Didgeridoo & Synthesizers,"The first song is my least favorite as it reminds me too much of the Trance Ambient music of the 90's. The remainder of the songs are great fun. I'm a fan of Didgeridoo music and there are several selections with just drums and didge. I love the way that interesting percussion instruments are layered into the songs--different bells, symbols, gongs, wooden blocks, shamen drums. The percussion is driving but not boring or monotonous. There are New Age sounding pieces with beautiful melodies and world music with exotic instruments. This is the best CD I've bought recently."
1,BEWARE!!!! This falls apart!,We got this cute trike for our toddler and it was falling apart 2 weeks after christmas. The handles totally come out of the base and it just crumbled to the crowd. We tightened it and everything a # of times and yet it still falls apart!!! BEWARE!!! this could be a safety recall issue.
2,Beware - This is not a safe tricycle!,"My son loves this tricycle, however if he is biking down a slight hill and turns quickly,it jack knifes. He has fallen several times, fortunately he always wears a helmet. I'm glad I only paid $[...] for this at a garage sale."
2,I can't recommend this trike to anyone,"I bought this for my 3 year old thinking it would be great. In reality, the seat is too high and the trike can tip easily. Also, he had a very hard time reaching the pedals and controlling the trike. If I could do it again, I would buy him a regular little tiny bike with training wheels instead. They actually are sturdier and sit lower to the ground."
2,"Cute, but not safe","We have been very disappointed with this trike. Not only will the steering wheel not stay positioned properly, but it is very tippy and dangerous. My son has had this trike for a year, and now at 3 it is still a hazard. Children sit up so high and the broad turning radius causes the trike to tip over very easily causing a big fall. We are going to buy a Kettler instead and anticipate better results. Cute to look at, but best left at the store, at least for 3 year olds."
2,Handlebars are useless,"Must admit got seduced by the radio flyer name and thought this would be great for my 2 year old, and it does look nice. The only problem is that the bike is useless because the handlebar keeps coming loose and out of alignment. It is just poor design, b/c you cant tighten the bolt any more. Couldnt do anything with it short of welding the handlebars in place, so decided to swallow the $20 paid to amazon and buy a new trike."
2,cheaply made...difficult to assemble well,"I think radio flyer was once called 'the american classic' or something like that. Well I bought two of these for my twins and I can tell you that the parts are poorly made, difficult to assemble properly, and feel very cheap. Spend the extra money and get something more solid than this, these are horrrible!"
2,Classic Red Radio Flyer,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year. I felt it being a classic it should be a durable bike to purchase. My daughter rarely rode the bike. It easily tips over when your child turns a corner. The Wheel fell off in the first 3 months, the rubber handle bar grips fell off, and the handle bars keep losening and need to be retighted. My daughter now has a cheap low to the ground trike she loves."
3,I should have read the reviews first,"Like the other reviewers, I am sorry I purchased this trike. I too had a moment of nostalgia and always thought Radio Flyer created good products, therefore, I bought it for my grandsons. It is very easily tipped over which leads to lots of tears and frustration. The handlebars are constantly crooked and it's driven me nuts trying to ""right"" them. For preschoolers, I'd recommend Step 2's Tractor--very durable, easy to pedal, and kids love it (especially with the cart/wagon accessory attached), and it's never tipped over. I've learned my lesson: Always check out the reviews on Amazon before purchasing toys."
4,Handlebar concern,"We purchased this trike for our 2 year old. Putting it together was no problem until I got the the handlebars. Instead of the ""old fashioned"" bolt that held the handlebars in place, there is a ring that you slip around the tongue where it positions onto the bike. You tighten the ring to secure the handlebar in the forward position. Both my husband and I tightened the bolt as far as we could but the handlebars are still not as stable as I would like. When she gets off the trike, the handlebars turn independently of the front wheel. I would return this trike if I could find my receipt.The seat isn't real stable either. It twists from side to side.With research I'm sure that there are much better tricycles out there although I liked the retro look but my daughter's safety is more important."
4,"I keep saying ""This is nice"" when I'm listening....","I buy a lot of trance, world, Deep Forest, etc. type music. Though much of it starts to sound the same after a while, OverDream keeps popping to the top. I'll put it in my 6CD changer at work or in my car along with other similar stuff out of my collection, and as I'm listening, it's always OverDream that catches my attention and makes me say ""This is creative. Different. Rewarding. Which CD is this???""Why? It isn't a long 90-120 BPM trance. It doesn't stop with one particular style. It blends a few voices in, but doesn't fall into the Indian/MiddleEast/... trap. It occasionally pulls in some latin style stuff, but I wouldn't call it ""Brazilian world trance beat"" -- just has influences.And it weaves its way from one rhythm to the next very nicely.All in all, well thought out, well produced, and gets you noddin your head in time with the music. Buy it. I wish Pimpi Arroyo had more to buy."
2,Flavorless Pop,"Imagine a house or jazz beat, house vocals/sampling without the diva, descent synth programming and various instrumental sampling and you would typically have an album I at least moderately like. But there is nothing on this even the least bit interesting. It is not creative enough to be jazz, but too flavorless to be pop. I have tried listening to this several times but it always ends up sounding like bland muzak they might play in a car showroom.Would make good background music except there is much, much more listenable stuff out there than this. Spend you money more wisely on Tosca, Minus 8, Ian Pooley, MUM, etc. That is what he is trying to sound like here anyway."
1,there is better out there,"this album was a gift from a friend. i guess the best way i can help you(the buyer) is telling you i returned it for moby's EVERYTHING IS WRONG. i have moby on lp but i never needed another copy until recently. a friend gave me this album and i listened to it in my car for a week. it was ok but it lacked magic. it just seems to float hopelessly like a dead astronaut in space. there is no life, there is nothing here to wrap yourself around. no emotion. nothing to wrap my mind heart or soul around. i think the graveyard down the block from me could be more lively if i asked it to be. this is not a bad album but it just lack that certain 'oopmh' that makes me go ""yeah baby..music to my ears!!"""
1,stinks,i have nothing good to say about this. i have another review here which states how good this album is. i admit my mistake. i was stoned when i listned to it. ignore my previous review and AVOID this worthless piece of trash of an album!!!urban
1,shop elsewhere,"the word boring should have a picture of this album. good to sleep to i guess, maybe a paperweight but i am not sure what this is. good it is not. stay away you should. thats my take on this"
3,Heavy M4 M16 Replica Airsoft Gun Double Eagle M83 A2 Full Automatic Electric Rifle,the m83 is ok i had and i thot it was the best gun ever util i shot at one of my friends from 50yrd away the bbs dropped at 35yrds.fps215 mag 40bbs good gun for beginers. now i use my agmmp001 sniper riffle.overall not that good
2,"Good Deal, but I don't like the Gun.","+ Got in the mail in about 2 days.+ No scratches+ Gun battery fully charged+ Many attachments and A LOT of rail.+ Rail protectors.+ Sling+ Good deal- The silencer and longer barrel attachments are made of cheap plastic and broke off within the first 2 days.- Laser pointer does not work- Inaccurate RDS- Inaccurate plastic sights (lol)- 30 round Mag :(- Only about -200fps unlike its 240fps advertised.- Hop up option does not work and it sucks hard chicken. The impulse begins within 20ft.- Not heavy at all, unlike it's being advertised.- Jams every 5-7shots, but all you have to do it pop out like and let a pellet drop out, and slide it back in.+++ Resold it to a friend for $30 (I added 1k pellets, and a speed reloader.)"
3,Good Gun Horrible Parts,Ok so ive had this gun for about 3 months now and ive had 4 things break already first it was the laser then the flash light broke affter that was the trigger then the barrel so all i have now is a case of plastic I would not recomend buying this gun at all i would go for metal only cause i have a metal ak 47 from 2002 that still works ive only had to change one thing on that and it was the barrel because i wanted a newer one so all and all DONT BUY THIS GUN unless ur going to use it for show
1,If you want this gun READ THIS,"This was my first airsoft gun. If you are looking for a gun that will break in a matter of minutes this is perfect. Heres a tip for beginers, buy a gun of an airsoft website with more information and spend more than thirty bucks! Without all the accesories i think this gun would cost about $10, thats realy bad. it is incredibly delicate too, i wasnt even rough with it either. i shot at my friend and some DUST got in the magazine, then it stoped working and the stock broke off. Also, this gun has ZERO lubricant and about 4 pounds of dead weight on it. its a 3/4ths scale model too so its not even realistic. TRUST ME even for a beginer, $40 is too cheap and 200 fps it too little."
1,M-83 arrived broke returns its better to throw away and pay for a new one,"returns its better to throw away and pay for a new one.. the M-83 arrived broke it wont fire. after hours we found out that it is semi auto / auto button. we must keep turning it back and forth and we can shoot a bb or two. hot imports called... maybe we will have a new m-83 in a month. {NOPE 6 weeks and still wating} first i have to send back. they will look at it then they will send a working one back. it took 11 edays for the first one to get to boston from west coast. . it dignt get processed fast. it was there for 3 weeks before we called to complain then the prosess started all over , call to same guy who cant do anything without autherization. just burn $40 bucks it will be less painful"
2,"Junk,junk, waste of cash for anyone who has it!!","I bought this gun about a year ago... I'm twelve and really into airsoft... now I have full metal m16. This gun was my secon aeg automatic. It sucks. 1st day I had it i set it to charge for awhile. Then I took it out to test it. 100 rounds out beutiful. Then I got some more ammo. It was the samw type of ammo for U to know. I fired the gun, and nothing came out. returned and got it fixed, took it back out of the box with a note that said was jarred. I tried again to see if they fixed it (by they I mean my retailer at Hobbytron.com) Samme thing happened. So I dismantled the rifle and salvaged what was still in good condition. When I got to the Gearbox, which was the problem in the 1st place, had a huge hole in it, and the gears were ruined. My guess was the cheap plastic inside broke during practice.Bottom line: IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!! PLEASE TAKE MY REVEIW INTO ACCOUNT IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT!"
3,Meh,Don't buy on impulse. Fun for like 5 minutes but overall a pretty shitty gun. I was just being stupid and bought it. I would sell it now.
1,WORST GUN EVER,I bought this gun thinking it was going to be GREAT and it turned out to be one of my worst buys ever. It might be the least accurate gun I have ever seen and its FPS isn't even that good. There is no point in the scope because it is so inaccurate. The first day I got it I was all excited and then I took it out and shot it.......Then I wasn't so excited. I doubt I could hit a target that was a foot long from 20 feet away with this gun. Also the battery takes forever to charge and it is impossible to access the battery compartment. The gun itself is made of a cheap plastic so it breaks REALLY easily. DO NOT BUY THIS GUN IT MAY SEEM LIKE A GOOD DEAL BUT ITS NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Kinda sucks,"When you open the box your like ""whoa"", But it sucks. All the add ons suck. The iron sights really are not that great. I guess the electric sight is good. The laser is cool at first but it does not work outside in day light. The flash light is good. But the battery isn't good. The grip is the only thing that's really good. The flash hider makes it look like an M4, but with out it, it looks like a weird SMG. The gearbox is fully plastic, so don't stress it out. The magazine has a design flaw that makes the first bullet not feed. Then those extra BB's can get jammed. The gun is just bad. Cause your in the middle of firing and it stops sending out BB's but the motor keeps running. I guess that's the cheap gear box. But it happens every time i put a new magazine in the gun. And it really pisses me off. If your looking for a good starter gun look somewhere else. This gun sucks."
1,Wouldn't buy,Would not recemound this gun to any one that wants power cause this is the wrong thang for thatRight the tightly ytuufhu tight bugging ygughihnggj yvjujgrb ughjj ugliness huhjk nhbhjj nhbhjj.
2,Not built very well,"This airsoft gun has poor build quality and even worse instructions. Reading the instruction manual was an exercise in futility as the English translation was not accurate and the effect was like reading gibberish. As a result of the poor instructions, I made a mistake in removing the battery cover for the scope, effectively breaking the on/off toggle switch. The gun itself seems to work okay but loading the pellets is difficult and the gun does jam once in a while. I would not recommend other users to purchase this item."
2,PLEASE READ,"When I got this gun I was amazed. BUT it was also my first gun. It looks fantastic.BUY ANOTHER MAG! mags are very small and I had to fixed it because it had internal probs. Flashlight DOSENT WORK, red dot is useless in the sun, laser broke, grip is NICE, my tacticle rails came were crooked, MY suppressor broke off inside! still inthere. Mag always leaves about 2,3 bbs unfired. Not a prob. Semi auto get jamed sometimes. Full auto shoot out fast YES! but not good for standard mag. the sling ischeap... but who needs it? Overall its an OK gun good for backyard battles once in a while..."
5,Durable for the price,My 9 year old son purchased this and absolutely loves it. I was sure that he would have it broken within the week due to how rough he is with things but it is quite durable and fun to use. The only downfall that I would have to say is the laser sight. Its certainly for looks and something fun to play with but the switch came off the wire inside of 30 days - not that big of a deal. My son loves his airsoft gun and I would purchase this again.
5,Nice gun,I have had this gun for about 2 months now and it is crazy!Its real size and all in black.First ill start with the aiming its pretty good and you can fix the aim with the hop.Second the grip is cool it reduces the weight of the gun and feels like a better position for your hand to be.Third the laser is nice and bright but the way to adjust it is strange and it works well outside to.Fourth the flashlight is uh kind of good but a little dim.5th the red dot scope is nice but when you put it where the pictures are you dont need it at all so unscrew the carrying handle and then it becomes a m4 carbine and put the scope there.Sixth the sound reducer is more for decoration.Where i live its desert and the gun works well out here.I tried using .20 gram bbs but the gun jammed after a while so i tried the .12 bbs and it worked fine so the best weight is .12.Its best for people that have about 3 or 2 more airsoft guns.This was written by an eleven year old so sorry for spelling errors. :)
3,Don't expect much.,"I bought it and when I first tested it out I was disappointed that it couldn't even pierce a soda can from about 13 feet away. It's not very accurate and the bbs tend to stray away from where there supposed to go. Don't expect to do much sniping with it. The laser scope is cool but it's useless since the bbs don't go too far. The semi fire gets jammed whenever you use it a lot, resulting in having to fiddle with the safety to get it to work. The shoulder strap gets in the way of the laser pointer. But at about 50 dollars I didn't expect much. It's fun to mess with it with your friends in your back yard.Overall it's not very powerful and I only recommend it for people new to airsoft. I wouldn't use it in an actual battle. It's more for messing around in the back yard."
1,Not as advertised,I called and asked some questions about the item and when it arrived I found it to be far less than the description and what I was told on the phone. The magazine is cheap and doesnt hold many pellets whaich was the question I had asked.
2,M16 airsoft gun,"Although the airsoft gun works, I was disappointed in the fact that I had to assemble part of it myself and that the flashlight and laser don't work. I would recommend buying other m16's unless this will be a starter gun"
3,Jams Way Too Much,"Great accuracy, yet sadly no power what so ever. Can't even pierce a cardboard box, but another problem I saw is that it jams. I had the gun for a day, and shot 2 BBs and it jammed. Then after 35 minutes of fiddling with the unjamming rod it got unjammed, I had two more shooting sessions, and then it jammed again."
2,Don't buy just because of all the accessories!,"I have to admit, all the accessories that came with this gun were pretty cool, but most of them were broken, defective, or performed poorly. Also, the fps is so low so you won't be able to actually play airsoft with it (unless you enjoy losing). After 3 months of not using it that much, a part of the barrel broke, the crane stock broke, and the magazine stopped working properly. Take my advice: save up for a better gun that won't let you down like this one! Buy a CYMA CM028 or a Galaxy MP5K"
4,Pretty good,"This gun is a pretty good gun. it has a fast rate of fire and feels good when shot. There is one problem though. I was firing it on semi auto and i didn't quite pull the trigger far enough and my action stopped. I took out the mag and two bbs fell out . I tried firing again and still no action. I did the same as before, but only one logical explainaion, JAMMED! Since there was nothing in the manuel (yes I do read the manuels) on getting out a jam I decided to call it dead. Though it broke, I am still going to get another, same kind, and it is still my favorite."
2,Inaccuracy makes it useless,"Gun looks awesome. Lots of cool accessories. Laser is great. But unfortunately it is so Godawful inaccurate that the gun is useless. If you hold the rifle in one spot and shoot full auto, the BBs go in all different directions. On Semi it's a little better, but you can rarely hit the same spot twice. Also the battery charger has no instructions, so I had no idea when the battery was fully charged. I just waited until they got warm. I bought my kids some good Combat Machine M16 Carbines. They are way more expensive with no accessories, but they are more powerful, hold way more ammo and shoot dead-on accurate. Spend the money and get a good gun. Don't buy this one."
5,qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnnm,"listen, i do not usually rate these kinds of guns, buuuttt, this one is different. this is the best gun for the money. perfect for backyard wars and light woods wars. perfect. get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun, get this gun."
3,Its ok for a beginner,"this gun is a pretty decent gun for the price but will definitely not stand up to $50+ guns. When you get hit with this gun it hurts about as much as a wal-mart pistol. This gun would be better if it had a hi-cap or even a mid-cap magazine. If you fire this gun on full auto it will be out of ammo in a matter of seconds. As i said before this gun is a great gun for the price but if you can afford a more expensive gun i would recommend that you buy another gun. This gun is good for a beginner but will not hold up to other, more expensive, aegs"
4,Overall Quality Good Performance Great,"The overall quality of this airsoft gun is good, but the performance for the price was great and worth it. This airsoft gn is great for beginners and average players. I would recommend getting an extra clip and a speed loader for in the heat of battle. Also have plenty of airsoft bbs and a pistol, so when you run out of both clips, you have a last resort. Even a cheap pistol would work. Sometimes you can make one, but it is not as good. ALso this gun has safe, semi, and auto firing modes making it extremely safe to use. The semi setting also helps you to conserve bullets in the heat of battle."
4,Heavy M4 M16,Product came quickly. I had a question about the charge of gun and contacted Airsplat. I was on hold less than a minute. I spoke to Larry and he quickly solved my problem. I have ordered from Airsplat before and the product is great!
4,fairly decent gun,if your looking for a decent airsoft gun and your just starting this is the one the gun is pretty sweet minus the fairly low fps. the extra stuff is good but isnt really meant for playing and the magazine your going to want to buy a second because you run out in record breaking time but other wise its a good gun
5,better than expected,"I opened the box and I was very surprised, it was made of metal and came with batteries for the accessories. I am very happy with the gun."
3,Review of the whimpy M4 M16 Double Eagle Airsoft gun/toy.,"I must say... This gun is kinda bad. I got it about two weeks ago, it has pretty bad accuracy, low FPS and you need to reload after you fire for just a few seconds. I only recommend this gun for younger children that play in a small yard. Do not buy this if you are even somewhat into airsoft. Over all the material is a very strong and sturdy plastic that will not break if you drop it. The gun has very high detail such as: A nice rail system, many attachments, and looks very real. The only thing this gun is good for is torturing your siblings and short range, and I mean very short range combat."
3,liked it... but magazine broke,"For the price that was paid it is okay. Shipping took long, which only enhanced the anticipation of getting it. Everthing went together fine. When taken out to actual use it with friends the aim was not good for distance, and my magazine broke when I went to reload it. Finding a replacement has not been easy. It is okay if your just goofing around your back yard and doing target practice, but when out in a field with friends competing, it is not recommened, unless you like to lose."
2,Not a reliable vendor,"I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift. It had good reviews and had allot of nice features. Although the scope, laser and flashlight all worked very well, the gun itself was very problematic. It constantly jammed, would not fire and was just to complicated to fix for my 8 year old every time it jammed. I tried contacting the vendor and that's when things got worse. First, the only way to contact the vendor was by e-mail. Then - you quested it - no responses.Lesson learned, don't bother dealing with this vendor. They do not back up their products."
2,monthly use,i bought this airsoft gun about a month ago and when it came it was in good shape everything was there but the thing that annoyed me was that after i used it a few times the FPS started to go down which was odd and now for some weird reason it wont shoot AT ALL!! so i recomened if you want to buy this be ready for it to break in a month or so
2,poor quality- jammed immediately,"We received the product and had a good time with it for about 30 minutes at which time it jammed a bb (one that came with the product). There was absolutely no way to retrieve the bb. we went online to get hints on how to remove it after reviewing the useless instructions that came with it. nothing worked. we spent the rest of the nite messing with it to no avail. The next morning i finally had to dismantle the gun completely at which point it completely fell apart, with no way to put it back together. it is now in the dumpster and the company offered us $5 credit...ummmm, not good enough. Perhaps we received a bad gun but the company did not try to back up their product so that leaves a little bad taste in the mouth- not buying from them again. The one good thing about the company is that they did immediately reply more than once so at least they didn't just ignore us.And they were polite. but not helpful."
4,"Ehh, why not?","This gun was surprising, in many ways. First off, it looks really cool, although full plastic, and is the perfect weight for running around in close quarter combat areas. Dont expect to snipe anyone down over about 20 feet. Second, it is the best LAEG under 50$. The hop up is minimal (when adjusted) and shoots well enough to be a good, cheap weapon. Mag size is very small, and mine actually fell out during a war so I had to order 2 new ones. BUY EXTRAS! All in all, this gun was a very good surprise, and I was satisfied with almost every aspect of this gun."
3,Decent but not great...,"This is a good gun for people who are just starting out and if your a pro, i suggest something a little more pricey, cause as this product shows, u get what u paid for"
2,broke in a week,i orderd this item and recived it after 2 weeksi liket the gun at first but the short hold for a charge was very annoyingafter little use i picked it up a week after reciving in an fired it only to be rewarded with a whirring noise and so rounds firingi went to my local airsoft retailer and was told that its gearbox was stripped and beacuse it was double eagle intagrated gearbox the could not replace it so its brokeif you are looking for a gun thats cheap heres your answer do not buy this if you intend to use it a lot.
3,OK GUN nice company,"this is a good gun if you dont play airsoft that much, your a beginner or you just play in your backyard. my gun broke in like 1 month, but then we called the costumer services and got new one for free from the double eagle company. i dont know if you can see from the picture, but there is actually a button right next to the trigger that you need to press then shoot the gun while your holding it down. if you play airsoft like every season it gets litteraly IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD DOWN so be careful. heres what i think about the guns inner-functions:1.rate of fire: 1-2 bbs per second possibly 32.battery lasts about 2-3 hours of full-firing3.mag holds like 40 bbs either get a speedloader or extra mags4.can probably can hit a quarter from 5 ft away with .40 gram bb's"
4,Best starter AEG for the money!,"I have been playing around with this gun for over a day now and I believe it is the best all round starter AEG for any one looking at getting into airsoft.The Barrel is actually 11in. long the gun comes with two barrel extentions one is a silencer and the other is the standard barrel with flash hider. the accuracy at 50ft is good, averaging a 10in grouping however beyond that the pellets seem to spiral off. the accessories are very generous: A laser sight, red dot sight, and flashlight all of which can be used on other guns. the gun has spare and high cap mags avialable which fit it nicely and give the feel of a real gun shooting experience. Over all a very nice entry level AEG and a fine addition to any collection.tip: buy a weaver rail for your carry handle, it makes the red dot sight more accessible and more accurate."
2,Airsoft Gun Review,"This gun would not shoot correctly. The only way it would shoot ""normally"" was by shooting it upside down. The company did send out a different clip to try and solve the problem but that still did not work. The gun was returned for a refund, but the company only offered us 80% of the value (apparently those were the terms in the small print). I can not recommend this gun and would have been more satified if I would have received a full refund. I also had to pay for the freight to have it returned. It ended up costing me alot of money and nothing to show for it."
4,Great,"The M83 is a pretty decent gun if your looking for something thats good for begginners. Its not the best gun out there but for $[...] its good. The attachments are ok but the sight kind of dissapointed me, it ok but its not a red ""dot"" scope its more like a small crosshair. The rail guards are cool but are useless when you have the laser or flashlight on. The laser is good I like it a lot, it goes really far. The flashlight is not the best quality you can get but it works,(who plays at night?) Then there are the barrel extensions, (regular, silencer) i think in my opinion the regular barrel look the coolest. The foregrip and the carrying handle is what I use the most because i just like it simple. The mag only hold around 40 rounds so I would stock up on these.Overall i would recommend if your just beggining airsoft like me. But if your looking around for something thats a little more high quality then i wouldn't get this but i think its great little starters gun."
2,Find a different gun,"This M4 was pretty nice. I got really excited and was always really careful so I could make it last, but somehow after one week it broke. I was just firing it and a plastic part in the motor snapped. FIND A DIFFERENT GUN."
3,Decent,"Clip broke 4th day of use, was dry firing it and it stopped so i figured, something is wrong with the motor, disassembled it and sure enough a wire from the motor was disconnected, had to resodder it and it works again, overall i give it 3 stars.Pros-Decent weightFeels realrate of fire,cons-WASTE OF MONEY."
1,Cheap & Cheaper,"We purchased this because it looked like a good price, but the gun didn't function properly. It jammed condinuously. When we contacted the seller they recommended we lubricate the gun. We did that and it worked for about 10 min. Spend a little extra on a higher quality gun."
1,poor quality,"Broke after first use, way to expensive. This product I made of a cheap plastic. Have to try duck tape the areas that broke."
1,worst thing i ever bought,it sucked so much. i took it out of the box and put it together and the batteries sucked so bad do not ever think about buying this DO NOT buy it
5,Great gun for backyard fights,This gun is a great gun for the money. I looked this up online and it costs 225 so for 30 to 50 dollors it is great. Also some people say the light doesnt work you have to contact the seller and he will send it to you for no charge. The scope is ok. Not the best for its money but it is still a pretty good scope. Also if anything is blurry on it clean the leanse and tighten the scope so thats about it. I recommend buying 4 mags or a 330 mag. But all around it is an awsome gun for the money
1,Very big ripoff,When I got this gun I thought it would be a great buy. I took it out in an air soft war and put a few hundred rounds through it. After a few hundred wasted bullets I found out I hadn't hit anybody! I had figured it was just the sight or my aiming but when I looked at it while my friend shot it I found out that every single bebe went up at a 50 degree angle. When I saw that I started thinking about if it was just the barrel wobbling but it was the bad quality of the gun I returned it for another one so I will see if it was just that gun but I will update
5,LOVE IT,"I got this airsoft gun 6 days after i ordered it and it works miraculously. All of the parts came, has not jammed at all, ive had it for about a month and its great. only thing is that when you're done shooting a mag with any amount of bbs, a bb or two will fall out when you release the mag. also when you shoot it, the bb might not feed into the chamber so when you shoot, the bb wont come out until the next round is fed then 2 bbs go out of the barrel, this only happens sometimes. all of the parts came good and secure, no damage. overall, its great."
2,its ite,Cool gun but it breaks easily. The magazine broke just by loading it. I only had the gun for a month
2,Heavy M4 M16 Replica Airsoft Gun Double Eagle M83 A2 Full Automatic Electric Rifle,pro's1.nonecon's1. small mag2. cheap battery3. horrible gear box4. breaks easily5. inside barrel is paper / cardboardin my point of view i would save up for a better gun that's more reliable like a scar-H. but that's my point of view.
3,its kinda good,"the First thing you should know is you need to be really careful with the barrel extensions because when i was putting my suppressor on, not very roughly either, the little thing that juts off that has the threads on it snapped off like it was made that way, also the red dot sight is useless because you can't take the front sight off, but one of the most important things is the stock and it works perfectly, the extra grip works really well and its really simple, it shoots just fine but i suggest that you get more ammo if you want shoot this thing, the back sight is a pain in the butt to put back on so be careful with it, you might just lose one of the tiny little nuts for it, the flashlight is complete crap so don't bother with it, and don't get your hopes up on the laser because i got everything that it says you get but the laser itself, so overall i give this gun a decent 3 stars."
4,Good movie prop...,"Not much to say here... all plastic. Works fine but if dropped it will break. Otherwise it looks real & can be used in movie project to save $$$. Overall I like it, just cheaply made... made in China go figure."
4,Arrived late,The product overall was worth the money. The amount of time I ha to wait for it in the mail almost made me forget about it. It came a week after it said it was supposed to.
4,Good but not great,This gun is good but it has a few thigs but very good for beginers iwhen mine was shiped it was missing a laser but and its not the most accurate gun ever but good. i reccomend
4,COOL,This Gun Is Pretty COOl. I Like The Way it Feels. Comfortable Grip.Only Con Is The Magazine. Only One Magazine. So Buy An EXTRA.Yea My Other Guns Came With 2 Mags. But This One ONLY ONE.But This Gun IS Still PRetty Good.
4,good gun,this is a really accurate gun and alothough it is not very fast on full automatic the accuracy makes up for it. the magazines is a drawback though they only hold 40 bbs and they tend to run out fast so u need a couple of speed loaders in ur pockets or just buy a different magazine but otherwise thats my only complaint about the gun
2,Poor Quality Product/Martial Arts Land has POOR PRACTICES,"Purchased 2 of these guns. One broke the first day due to the cheap plastic ""Flash Barrel"" due to normal play and product was missing a part. Company was very hard to reach. For 3 months they gave me the run around and then told me to send in gun for replacement(I'm sure due to my persistance). When they received gun, they ACCUSED US of breaking it and would not replace it. Also said I only contacted them once, 3 months after we got product. They never acknowledged all my phone calls and other emails I sent.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, USE OTHERS AND SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE!!!!!"
3,plastic = bad,"the gun is a good gun, for about a month.then little problems start popping up like;the mag breaks, the mag release breaks, the laser and light stop working.and i suggest never to use the barrels - because they're going to break anyways. also, don't trust the strap.it's an OK gun but you might want to be a little less cheep when it comes to buying an airsoft gun."
2,Experienced buyer,"Well, when I received this order, the flashlight and scope were completely busted. Also, the gun's clip can slip out so you have to hold the clip for it to stay in. Getting back to the company is hard! There is no phone number and they don't respond to emails. I recommend emailing them, wait two days, and then call Amazon. They will make the company respond. I should be getting my money back, or at least amazon said so. Well, I know you don't want to hear it but you really have to just save up an extra 70 bucks or so and by a JG or something. In the long run, this will save you time and money. Hope I helped... don't buy from Airsoft Central. Peace........................UpdateTwo weeks later. Company would not accept my return! Im gettin money from Amazon. What a hassle. But at least I can sell the parts of the gun on ebay lol. But wow. Seriously, this is ridiculous!"
4,great for beginners,I got this gun for christmas last year and i was pretty excited to open it. when i first opened the package the gun looked great and feels great. The red dot scope thingy mine came with doesnt work but the gun isnt accurate enought to use it. it has a pretty high fire rate so i would recommend buying a few extra mags. The only problem i had was i accidently dropped the gun on some hard pavement and the stock broke off but i easily fixed it with some hot glue.Cons:great for beginnerspretty high fire ratehurts at close rangePros:mags only hold 45not very accuratethis is a great gun and i would highly recomend it for beginners.
3,I'm happy,"By the most part I'm happy with it. The only problem I've been having is it not sending out consistent shots. What I mean is it will fire 1 pellet for every 3 or 4 pulls of the trigger. In full auto it get's a little worst. The lubricating grease that was used is coating the pellets and causing them to jam just below the barrel opening. It doesn't matter whether I'm in normal or hop. Now I have cleaned out the aperture where the pellets leave the magazine and enter the barrels firing chamber and that seams to help for a few shots but after that I have to clean it again. So, I don't know if it's the lubrication or if the magazine spring is understrength. If anyone has any idea's PLEASE let me know. joseph_millan@yahoo.com Otherwise I'm gonna keep messing with it to see if I can work this out."
3,ok gun,when i got this gun it worked great however after a day i accidently dropped my mag and it broke i finally fixed it only to find out that i had to use a bungee cord to hold it in overall it was a good gun would recomend to someone who isn't too serious on airsoft wars backyard battle at most good at short distance.
3,Good Gun For Beginners,This is a great gun for beginners like me. I bought this gun from airsplat for 120 dollars and i liked it a bit when i first got it. It was also missing some attachments. (the flashlight.) It has pretty low FPS but it is pretty accurate. I got bored of this gun after a while and now am searching for a better Full Metal airsoft gun. The battery goes in the barrel and the top of it is very hard to get off. Everytime you take it off you almost have to bend it in half. I personally would not recommend this gun.
3,get a new clip.,This gun is great it has fast shipping but im mad I got it today and it dosen't workso I look in to it and its the clip the spring is not big enough so buy a better clip.
4,Cheap But Good Gun,This is a fairly nice gun for its price. I have had it for 3 years and it still works great. It Isnt very powerful but it is powerful enough to give my friends welts.
1,Not the gun i ordered,Well I ordered this from Airsplat and turns out whenI get the gun they send me a 150 dollar half metal gun which is a great one but still wont what i ordered so keep that in mind
3,IT DIDN'T WORK!!!!,My gun didn't work! It would only shoot upside down but it wasn't the clips if it was the clips then both didn't work. But when I did shoot it upside down it worked fine and had decent/good accuracy but the hop-up is anoying shooting upside down because I'm pretty much shooting the ground. It had a good rate of fire but I would recomend only using full auto if your attacking multiple targets that are close together. One thing I hated was the scope. The thing that you use to aim when you don't have a scope blocks half the scopes view and the scope just plain sucks.
1,Not what it said it was,"The displayed information was for a M4 M16, Double Eagle Automatic M83 electric rifle. I only received one gun, the M83. It also did not shoot as fast as claimed. Very unhappy with purchase."
1,Big trouble from little china...,"So my girlfriends having a rodent problem in her backyard, naturally me being the loving caring boyfriend make a mental note and show up down the line with roses and this gun in hand."
1,Help,Hi this looks like a sweet deal i was wondering wat type of m16 magazine will work with this airsoft gun thx to the person who answers
2,Really cool...until it breaks,"This is not bad at all for a beginner's LPEG, and I probably would've given it more stars if it had not broke on me after less than a month. Blame it on the plastic gearbox; first the gun jammed on me and would only fire semi-auto, and eventually it just stopped working altogether. You could probably do a lot worse than this, but just remember if you're not spending a lot of money on it, you're going to get what you paid for!"
4,Nice for begginers,"This gun is perfect for beginners. A little heavy but it comes with alot of fun attachment which i enjoyed. I've had this gun for about 2 and a half years and i still use it today. one time the gun stopped working and i had to take it apart from the inside, but it was prety easy and i havent had any problems with it since. I strongly advise buying a speed loader and an extra mag for this gun.Pros: Cheap, reliable, looks good, FunCons: the barrels break off (but i don't care cause i don't like the barrels any way) only holds 40 rounds per mag.This gun is a great first gun!!!"
3,Very realistic Air Gun,"When I ordered this product from China I was skeptical. There are a few problems, but the level of realism and detail is very good. Some of the add-on parts seem a little cheap, and the scope is a joke.But the sights came pretty much lined up. The full auto mode fires a continuous stream of BB's without much vibration or kick so you can pretty much point and shoot. The single shot mode is very accurate.I bought this for fun to shoot at bottles and targets. It definitely does well for that purpose."
1,terrible,the safety goggles were missing. and the batteries for the laser died after 10 mins of use. also the gun does not shoot so im returning it. DO NOT BUY. i saw reviews that said dont buy but i did anyway & it was a mistake. ur better off going to bass pro & buying a gas gun with 480 feet per second for about $60 that will last a longer time than this piece of junk
2,Poor Quality,"Terrible. It is extremely innaccurate and has a pathetic rate of fire. It is made of cheap plastic and it only shoots 175 fps with .2 gram bbs, DO NOT use .12 gram bbs if your going to use them the gun will jam. They come with a wimpy magizine that only holds 45 rounds and they only give you one. It is a decent gun for the price but it is not ment to take to an airsoft park, BACKYARD WARS ONLY. I should have just saved up 60 more dollars and bought a decent one at big 5."
2,meh....not sooooo good ( this gun is not heavy at all... its cheap plastic),"ok when i bought this airsoft gun i thought it was going to be really good because of all the reviews where fairly good ones. on that note when it arrived at my house i was exited so i when i opened it and found that its a really cheap quality airsoft gun made in china with missing parts... (i like how in the title of this gun it says ""heavy"", this thing is far from heavy its not even made of abs plastic instead its cheap plastic lol). the only good thing about this gun is that it works somewhat good to say the build quality its not so good.all in all there are better guns for the same price as this on amazon."
3,not the best,"this gun is actually kind of sad. i think it has more cons then pros (personally)pros:1. its a fun gun to shoot2. its full auto3. the battery lasts a long time4. its customizable (its easy to cut, glue and paint it)cons:1. the clips run out VERY fast (like 5 seconds)2. the range sucks3. the hop-up broke when if first tried it4. theirs a metal bar in the stock to give it weight and only a small piece of plastic holds it, so mine FELL off i didn't hit it on anything it just FELL off5. its 100% plastic6. all the attachments that come with it suck (except the fore grip)7. the my magazines broke"
1,ewww,This was my very first gun and i was happy when i got it but it is horrible. i didn't enjoy it and it wasn't very accurate. :/
1,You Get What You Pay For,This Double Eagle M83 A2 riffle looks a lot better than it actually performs. Don't let the cheap price fool you into buying this otherwise useless toy.Spend the extra money and buy something worth having or that least works as intended.Some of the problems we encountered:*Laser missing the mounting hardware*Ammo clip does not seat correctly therefore only shoots while upside down*Thread on one of the barrels is damaged making it difficult to screw on
3,It's ok for the price.,For the price it's ok. Magazine capacity really sucks. There are no upgrades and extra mags are a little expensive.
3,"first airsoft, pleased","I bought 3 of these guns, so far, for me, they have been a good investment. These are my first airsoft guns, I use them with my family in the backyard, so there is no pro discrimination here, but I like them all the same"
3,Hmmmmmm....,"Well, the 9 long days wait to get this gun have resulted in an M4 replica that does not perform as it should. When first fired, it didn't shoot at all and the bb's jammed in the barrel and the magazine. I had this happen about 7 times in the first 10 minutes. When it did shoot, it only fired about 180-220 fps. Even with the hop up, most of the shots fired randomly zoom upward, and some would fall out of the barrel and plop to the floor. However, the gun somewhat redeems itself through the many attachments it comes with. An adjustable red dot sight, a quick remove grip, decent flashlight (which I can hook on to my pistols sometimes), a sweet laser that's actually accurate, (once adjusted) removable carrying handle, interchanging barrels (which shoot the same btw) and heat grips... HEAT GRIPS!? That's a first in this industry. All in all this gun is semi-decent, but it feels like you're buying the attachments and the gun is just a free bee."
2,The M83 airsoft gun,"Well, it worked for about a day or two. The battery holds almost no juice in it and how do I get the battery out?"
4,awesome gun,this gun is a good gun it is about 200 fps. A thing is that it only has a 40 round mag. it has good attachments but the scope is okay. It has good accuracy and is good for sneaking up on people. I have had it for a couple of weeks now and I have still not charged the battery so the battery lasts long. When I have wars it is a good gun to use it is also good because there are two safes.
2,Dang!,I got the m83 and i was exsited the glasses were broken and but still happy all the stuff was their i played with my friend with it he kicked it once BAM Stock Brok i was Mad
1,"Pretty bad, first gun material","its pretty bad in everything:rangeaccuracyrpmpowerbattery lifebattery sizebattery charge timePlastic is cheap, mag doesnt feed good, bad amount of ammo the clip holds, clip is cheap, all attachments are crap, red dot breaks, grip is ok..., sights are pretty bad, rail guards dont really work good, flash hider and suppressor are cheap, flashlight broke right away, stock is uncomfortable, sling is cheap, 2 orange tipes with flash hider.... gay.Dont like it at all.but would recommend for a first gun, after that get a real gun."
1,SUCKS,Broke after 1 game-shoots slow-doesnt hurt at all-took it apart to see why it wasnt working- found out u cant take it apart without breaking some pointless peices off-so u have to break it to fix it-has weights (that look like lead) inside of the gun all the attatchments suck so far the best one was the flash light ( lol the flashlight is beast i put it on my CM041 CYMA MP5 ) Sling Sucks red dot sight= pointless you cant put it on this gun- lets just say buy a 150$-220 gun so you dont learn the hard way that most cheap guns completely suck. I never saw a good Double Eagle gun either... get a JG- a newer CYMA (CYMA's old guns suck but new ones are better) Tokyo Marui or a $230 Dboys gun if u want to take the risk of DboysRed dot sight works well on other guns but still not the greatest.Overall:To lightTo weakTo slowPoorly Designed
1,read me if your buying this gun,"ok, pretty good but not too accurate, looks really cool though. the gearbox is not metal. since that you only get to have a working gun for 3 weeks becouse the gears grind down. amazing battery length! the bolt dosnt move back like a real m4. the scope is pretty good but for that it goes innaccurate every time you shoot it. get extra mags goes quickly. dont lose your speedloader, loading by hand sucks."
3,Good for a while,When I bought this gun it didnt come with the lazer as it said. I had a lot of fun with this gun until some on stepped on it and the stock broke off. I still kept using it because it still worked. Then my friend put to much bbs in the magazine and it broke and everything fell apart so now I'm buying a new mag.
4,How it looks,This gun looks so cool! Me and my friend have been talking about it for months. it isGreat for beginners like me
2,Don't buy it...,"Unless you intend on using this gun for a battle that is 20 feet in front of you or a are a super beginner with no money then to NOT buy this gun! It is inaccurate to a substantial degree and sprays bb's every direction. I even recall the feeding of the rounds to be awful, you can just hold the trigger and you will get one bb out every 3 or so shots, it's ridiculous. Double Eagle is a low grade company that makes either beginner stuff or just really cheap stuff, i would not recommend this to anyone and there are many better rifles out there for a better price guarenteed. Also i remember never getting the A.C.O.G. scope to even work at all! I put new batteies in i spent hours trying to get it to work but no result. Trust me this gun is only good for a super beginner with a low budget or a super cqb battle."
2,not the best,This product is good when you get it and for some starters but as you use it you'll know why it's not the best and what you expected. You have to charge it well or you are gonna mass up you gun. So ask someone if you don't know how to charge it properly.
2,WTF,Me and a friend were playing airsoft and I was going around a corner and fell and the gun fell to the side and broke off the stock and grip and the silencer from a little fall the product is not worth the moneyHeavy M4 M16 Replica Airsoft Gun Double Eagle M83 A2 Full Automatic Electric Rifle
3,Decent gun,"This gun lasted a while but it fell apart as i used it. The battery life is long but the fps is terrible. The guns attachments are added up to the price of the gun if you buy them separately, so that's nice. The magazine doesn't hold much ammo for the fire rate when it is fully charged."
2,M4,"This gun looks real. But when i try to shoot my friend, the bb doesnt even go that far/ doesnt even hurt too."
1,What a piece of junk,Bought this for my son for christmas within 1/2 hour it was broken. The stock broke off just putting it together out of box. The barrel of gun broke 20 min later. This is before we even got to shoot it. Then the next day we used what was left of the gun as it still worked and the clip broke shortly after he started shooting. If you want a gun that looks really cool but is a piece of junk.....well then this gun is for you. Save your money and buy a different gun. Very dissapointed!!
1,nerds,you nerds need to get some real guns. maybe then you wouldnt be on here polluting the real gun accessories. seriously every time i turn around over here i gotta deal wit dumb airsofteqipment. plus you cant use this stuff in the zombie apocalypse. plus if you want to try out your skills join the military and see what your really made of.
1,a bad buy. >:(,"I got this gun thinking it would fair for the price. But boy was i wrong. If you lose your loading rod your screwed because that happend to me.The butt stock broke off easily,the gun is very,very VERY unacurate,red dot doesnt work very well the extra barrels are for nothing and the flashlight doesent work worth anything. the only good thing throughout the whole product is the laser. Yes the laser. dont buy this. You cant beat a regular spring gun."
1,bad gun,this i think is not a very good gun either i got a bad gun or it just sucksfirst bad clip sizesecond mine doesnt even work payed 50$ and dont work the battery doesnt charge and the wires are fried
1,pathetic,this gun is terrible the first day I got it the flashlight was broke its not powerful and the gun would not shoot and then all of a sudden the gun shot 15 bbs. this is a overrated piece of chicken!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Breaks easily,This gun worked fine....for about the first hour. The gun jams and then it broke. Wont buy another thing made in CHINA!!! Not worth the money.
1,Hit Guns will not honor their warranty,"The gun is made with very weak and thin plastic parts. Within minutes of taking the gun out of the package, the barrel broke, then the back stock broke and other parts started breaking with light handling. I contacted Hit Guns immediately( which sounds like a 16 year old kid selling stuff out of his basement) and they refused to stand by their warranty. I sent them numerous pictures of the damages as they asked. I filled out the RMA form as they asked. Then a month passed by, no word from them, I had to email back twice to get a statement that they will not honor their warranty. The attraction is the cheap price, but believe me it is not a matter of if it breaks but when it will break. They will not stand by their warranty. Amazon please do not carry products by companies with poor business practices such as Hit Guns."
1,SUCKS,I buoght this airsoft rifle seven days befor i recived it.I opend the box and played with it and i noticed that the hopup will clog up the gun.The silencer broke when i gently hit it on my sisters knee.The only good things were the attachments. The magazein is too heavy so you half to hold it in or else it wount shoot properly.Over all it is the suckiest air soft rifle ever.DON'T BUY IT IT SUKCS.
1,Broke after one round,Basically a waste of $30 dollars. I used the BBs that came with it and it was awesome. The next round of BBs I used were .20g and this piece of crap would not shoot them. I guess I will try holding it upside down to see if that works. Please don't waste your money on this gun.
1,STOP!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"I never leave feedback but this is a special circumstance... This gun looks really cool. This now concludes the part of our complimenting section. This thing is a major pile of junk. It was a Christmas gift so it sat under the tree while the seller's warranty expired. On the day it was opened, the laser broke, the magazine literally fell apart and one of the barrels cracked and it never even left the house! The user's manual said nothing about a manufacturer's warranty so I emailed the seller and they also could not find a manufacturer's warranty. This was the biggest waste of money... EVER!!! Why doesn't the manufacturer provide a warranty? They know it is going to fall apart immediately. Instead of wasting your money on this, send me your money and I will put it to better use. Have a good day."
1,Don't waste your money,This gun looked really cool online but it is poor quality and cheaply made junk! The stock broke off the thing the first day my son had it. He wasn't playing ruff with it at all. The gun simply fell from our patio table onto the deck and the stock broke. It's made of cheap looking plastic. I would never buy this product again!
3,Really cool!,"I bought this on a whim and I have to say it's pretty cool to mess around with. It's really close to the actuall weight of the real thing and if you did'nt have the orange details you would'nt be able to tell the deifference. Id say it's accuarate up to about 20 ft. After that the pellets really takes off but just for popping off around the yard or with a friend it's worth it. Make sure you wear eye protection or you WILL get hurt. It stings on bare skin and even on clothed skin ay close range. Now I'm only giving it a 3 star rating beause of the painfully slow shipping. Took over 10 days from CA to NY, that's too long, matter of fact I tracked the package and it was in CA for 3 days alone before it left the warehouse. Overall it's a cool gun if you're just starting out in airsoft like me or really as a souvenir."
4,"Awesome for the price, great quality and included accessories!","Won't rehash all that's been said... great quality, gun is nice and heavy feeling, and the added accessories are nice (laser, light, scope). As others have said the scope is pretty useless but for my kids, they loving having an illuminated scope. I took off the h-bar on the gun (the carry handle) which gets in the way if looking through the scope.Pros: build quality, accessories, priceCons: to charge battery, you have to remove the scope, laser, and light to remove front stock. Also, only 30 or so shots in the huge magazine? Come on folks! That runs out in a second!"
4,You get what you pay for,"Guns work fine. They do stick sometimes, I'm pretty sure that it's due to double feeds. The extra pieces are plastic, so make sure that you are very careful. Is worth the money though. Great for a starter gun for my kids. Hard to site in, but does work well with a larger battery. All and all, a good buy."
3,Decent Gun,"This gun took 10 days to ship, I was not too happy about that, but who cares. I will start by saying that this is my first airsoft gun. Almost everything on the gun is plastic, so some things may break. When I was using the barrel extension (not the silencer), It hit the ground, and the tip broke off. I guess this is why they gave you a silencer. The firing rate is decent, but I will say this DO NOT USE .12 BBS THEY WILL CURVE UP AFTER 15 FEET. I use .2 bbs and they work fine. The disappointing thing about this gun is the fps, which is about 200 at most.Overall, this is a good gun for people who just like to have fun with their friends, but if you are serious about airsoft, do not get this gun."
3,Good but..,"other people say there gun came with 8000 bb'?! i got like a little bag with 20 bb's. was this supposed to come with a laser sight because mine did not. it was not in the box. anyway, the gun fired great. didn't jam, accurate good fps. but it is not very durable just be careful."
2,Good Until it Breaks.,"The gun is clearly a very cheap clone, and obviously its not the best of quality. However, it shoots pretty good for the price. However, mine broke without ever being knocked around hard. The hand guards are also not compatible with any other kind I know of.But don't buy this gun, you will lose all your money. Just pony up for the real thing, go with a quality clone like jing gong or echo 1. You'll lose your money, and being cheap with airsoft will be very expensive in the long run."
3,fun while it lasted,"This gun was really cool when I got it. I only got to play 1 airsoft war with it then about a week after its only war it started skipping rounds on auto and semi then it started to not work at all. When i pulled then trigger it would make a saw noise like an electric saw. it worked well when i had it decent range, ok accracy, but mag size was too small. I contacted the supplyer I got it from and now they are sending me the double eagle m85 because they were out of m83s."
4,okay,"this is a great gun. the site the gun comes with is okay, the irons are really good.i also like the grip. get an extra mag youll need it. the flashlight and laser are good to. the only complain is that it took 8 days to ship, 3 days over the time it was supposed to come."
3,Good Beginngers Gun,"I bought this gun and so far its ok. I looks great, good details, the package comes with an extra magazine and 4 BB bottles of 8000 bbs so thats good. What is dissapointing is that this gun looks awesome but it doesnt perform up to its looks. For example it only shoots 200 fps which is extremly low. The bbs dont hurt and the electric scope isnt that good. But overall its a good beginners gun but not for me."
1,gun broke the 1st time out of the box,"My son was very excited to get this gun. He loves the look and the features it offers. Unfortunately, the quality has been an issue. He had a piece break the 1st time out of the box. He has had other parts of the gun break as well. We contacted the company and received correspondence. They were apologetic about the issues we have and promised to send a replacement. That has been almost a month ago and still have not received it."
1,sucks!,this gun sucks! its worst then a nerf gun i bot it and wasted ALL MY MONEY! dont get this gun its mad out of plastic and looks like santa claws and his magical migets made this gun! THIS GUN IS A PEACE OF CRAP! DONT GET IT!!!!!
1,this is not a good one,this gun sucks and it really bad i dont like how when i opened it it didnt even work on the first try its so messed up wath there trying to sell to people please dont buy thing your gana end up returning it trust me this gun is no good the range it 1 to 2 cm from the barrel
1,do not buy this gun! IT SUCKS!,IT BROCK THE 2 DAY I HAD IT!THE GUN WOULD NOT SHOUT STRAT IT WOULD ALWAS GO UP! IT GETS GAMED ALL THE TIME1 I HAT HAT HAT THIS GUN! THE TRIGHER WILL NOT COME BACK!
4,Cool Gun,"Gun arrived with all parts, but a bit difficult to assemble. Has an accurate shot, but the shot is affected by wind. It looks authentic and works well too, and my son really likes it..especially they way it fires at a fast rate."
5,Awesome!!,"im new at airsoft so i can't really compare with any other guns, but i got mine the other day and it's awesome. really accurate, hop up helps alot, add ons that its comes with are great, shipping was really fast came earlier then they said it would, 8 day i think, low price, great for beginners."
4,Great Gun,"This is one great gun, love it. This gun is heavy because its half metal half plastic. Its metal inside to give it the weight and sturdyness and its plastic outside to give it the details and smooth finish. Love this gun, great deal, you get a good gun with a bunch of accesories including a flashlight, handguards, T grip, electric scope, an extra magazine and 4 bottles of bbs. This gun is great to play with your friends because this doesnt hurt that much."
1,"Chicago Cuttlery, Insignia 10 Pc Set","I recently purchased a 10 pc set of Chicago Cutlery, Insignia set. Less than a week later the printing on the knives started disappearing. Now, less than a month later the knives are seeping with rust. There are fine pits and cracks that seep rust and I am very upset as I cannot return, exchange or get a refund for them."
1,expected better,"These are the worst steak knives I have ever purchased. The tips of the knives have actually broken off 3 of 4 knives, and the blades have rusty spots on them. Even though the price was relatively low compared to ""top of the line"" knives, I expected more from a name like Chicago Cutlery."
1,Total Junk,"I own a set of the walnut tradition from Chicago Cutlery and have been very happy with them. I wanted something I could put through the dishwasher, so I ordered these, thinking the quality would be on par with my other knives.Mine didn't even make it to the dishwasher - all 8 that I ordered had cracked handles upon delivery. On top of that they were pretty dull - nothing like my walnut handled chicago cutlery knives...."
5,Greatest steak knives I have owned.,Very balanced and easy to cut. No serrated edges that tear the meat. Very well worth the money.
3,A workmanlike adaptation.,"The Star Trek Log... series is an adaptation of the episodes from the old animated Star Trek series; the episodes in Log Six are ""Albatross"", in which Kirk and the Enterprise crew must find evidence to acquit Dr. McCoy of having accidentally caused a major plague nineteen years before; ""The Practical Joker"", in which the Enterprise's computer develops a deviant personality; and ""How Sharper Than A Serpent's Tooth"", in which the Enterprise meets the entity who was worshipped as Kukulkan by the ancient Aztecs. Foster does a fine job of portraying the characters and developing the plots, and the episodes are reasonably interesting although the last one strikes me as derivative of the episode from the original series, ""Who Mourns For Adonais"", in which Kirk and company meet Apollo."
1,"It's a 4-pack, not 6-pack","This is a 4-pack packaging, not a 6-pack, contrary to what is indicated in the product description, and the picture.If you look carefully though, in the ""Product Specifications"" section, the ""Item Package Quantity"" is 4 (not a 6), which is the correct packaging number.Amazon refunded the price difference, and as usual their service gets a 5 star rating, but not the product as advertised here."
2,Gregory Peck Collection,"I was disappointed in my purchase, because I did not realize there would be so few movies on ""the Collection""."
2,"Playful, laid back psychedelia","The band The Wild Flowers was a kind of rehearsel for more ""serious"" bands. The hand full of songs the band's constantly changing line-up produced, sound like undeveloped experiments performed by unexperienced muscicians. Which doesn't mean their music is childish or unpleasant, in fact it's light-hearted and spontanious, just not very interesting, yet. Many members would join other bands of which Carvan and the Soft Machine were the most succesful. For fans of these bands it is interesting to hear their sounds and styles being developed here."
5,My favorite book ever.,"Still Mostly True is the greatest book I have ever had the pleasure of reading- it cheers me up when I am sad, inspires me when I am blocked, and reminds me to look toward the little things in life for happiness. I appreciate Brian Andreas more than he will ever know for helping me, my mother, and my roomates at college through good, bad, happy and sad times. I only wish he had fifteen books like this one. I would never stop smiling!"
3,Installed on 2008 Pontiac Vibe,"Bought these to go with the new Hawk pads. The ""ticking"" sound from the rotors is somewhat annoying. I could turn up the radio like some of the younger generation. Anyway, one rotor warped after 10,000 miles. Had them both turned and that fixed that problem. The ""ticking"" was reduced somewhat. One thing for sure is that it takes very little pedal pressure to stop at lower speeds. Be sure any passengers are wearing their seat belt. But that could be the Hawks. I bought these dimpled and slotted because they were about $5 over the plain rotors and what the heck I'll give them a try. To do this over again I would go with plain quality rotors. The Mrs. drives this car mostly as a commuter and she is a brake eater. Time will tell. Of course, your driving style and conditions may warrant these rotors."
2,Suzy saves it,"Bad dubbing, atrocious special effects, and Stan is so sick it's hard to watch him. That said, some of the slapstick is pretty good and the movie does have one significant redeeming feature that make it worth watching - Suzy Delair! Wow, she is one sumptuous beauty."
2,It's different; try one of the other L & H films first,"This European film, produced in 1950, was the last Laurel & Hardy movie, and most of the international cast and crew spoke other languages. (In the film Stan and Ollie speak English but everyone else is dubbed.) Both comedians had serious health problems during filming, and these are obvious in the film. The language barrier also caused communication problems on the set. Thanks to Laurel & Hardy, what should have been a total disaster is not all that bad. There's a novel setting and plenty of L & H humor, as they inherit a ""yacht"" and a tropical island. Laurel & Hardy fans may enjoy this as a novelty; first-time viewers should try an older, more typical L & H movie from the '20s or '30s before seeing this one."
3,"CD player good, car kit substandard","The CD player works very well and has some nice features for the price like replay, random play, location memory, etc.However, the car kit cassette insert for the cassette player in my car is of poor quality. It seems to work when it wants to and it doesn't want to very often.I took a 5-hour car trip recently and was relying on the CD player to keep my kids entertained. I think it worked for a 45 minute stretch and after some frustrating attempts to get it to work, removed it and packed it away.I would give the CD player 4 stars and the car kit 2 stars and the car kit is really why I bought this model."
4,Sensus,"I really like this CD player. I wish that it had a program mode though. But for it's low price I can't complain. It did not come with an AC adaptor, but it is very effecient with batteries. One pair of AA batteries lasts 20-30 hours. (I remember when portable CD players would use up 4 AA batteries in less than 8 hours.) I usually carry this CD player in my jacket while walking and it hardly ever skips. Great value."
3,For example ...,"I bought this book for my counseling class, and found it mediocre. It was very informative, but gave hardly any examples. I work well with examples, and even though most concepts were easy to understand, some would have been made clearer with a good example of how it applies to a counseling session, clients, etc."
2,"Fascinating topic, difficult reading","Although one of my favorite movies of all time is ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" I knew that much of the details were fiction. That's why I purchased this book, hoping to learn -- as promised -- the real story behind the Burma-Siam railroad.However, the book's prose is so bland and uninspiring that it manages to make an otherwise interesting story boring. There is little narrative here, the paragraphs are large and clunky and the comma-free punctuation will annoy readers.That said, if you have a deep interest in and knowledge of the Pacific Theater in World War II, you might find this book more approachable."
5,Great Barbie/Krissy playset,Both dolls and the carriage are well made and cute as can be. A young child will have no problem helping Barbie walk behind the pram with Krissy inside. The playset makes a pretty display for a collector if it's taken out of the box! Way too cute and fun to stay in a box. I bought mine in 1999 when it first came out and paid $26. It is still in very good condition. Didn't know the value had soared but I'm keeping mine. You'll love it!
5,My daughter loves this,My daughter got this a couple years ago for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! She has watched through the entire series many times and still continues to watch through it! It may be a little expensive but it is worth it! If you are having any doubts just forget about them and buy the series. Its worth it!
5,Awesome set,"All I can say is if your a big fan of Full House buy this set, it will not only save you money then buying each one individually, but it is well worth it, also it is a awesome dvd set!. You will not be disappointed."
1,Vile and revolting,"I remember periodically watching this show when younger and thinking it was ridiculous in the simplicity of the problems the family faced. The characters oozed enough sugar that I'm sure long-term fans suffer from diabetes. And yet, there was litle else on television of value.Flipping through the channels the other day, I just so happened to catch bits of a rerun episode and was about to show my little kids until I discovered the subplot about DJ's friend, Kimmy - more annoying than Jar Jar Binks - and her non-stop makeout sessions with her boyfriend. Forget family friendly, this show is disgusting and stupid.You'd be better off teaching your kids life lessons through a good book."
5,Full House anyone?,"Full House complete series is a great set to add to your dvd collection. If you are a huge fan of Full House then I recommend you adding the complete series to your collection. It has every single full house episode in a cute little collectible box. The only thing I wish is that there were more extras that came with the complete series. So sit back, relax, and enjoy hours of Full House entertainment with Danny, Jesse, Joey, Becky, DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle.If you already have all of the seasons of this show then I don't recommend you getting the box set because there really isn't anything special about it besides the packaging BUT if you love the show and haven't kept up with collecting the seasons then make a wise purchase and buy the complete box set."
1,The box wasn't full,I received my order.However it isn't complete. The box is not full. I received only 16 DVDs. Two DVDs for each season and not four. The other 16 DVDs are missing.Above it's written what I received.Full House: The Complete Series CollectionSeason 1 - disc 3 and 4Season 2 - disc 3 and 4Season 3 - disc 1 and 2Season 4 - disc 3 and 4Season 5 - disc 3 and 4Season 6 - disc 3 and 4Season 7 - disc 1 and 2Season 8 - disc 1 and 2
1,Very Disappointed,I ordered and received this product but I can't review the quality of the dvd's because I had to send it back :( I opened it up and was sad to see that exactly half of the dvd's were missing out of it. I don't know how something like this could happen but you would think it would be kind of hard to miss as they were putting the set together. I know amazon.com has nothing to do with the putting together of this set so it's not them i'm blaming. I'm thinking someone somewhere got the other half and was just as disappointed as I was.
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT- MISSING DISCS,"I too have experienced the same fate as other reviewers. I only received 16 out of the advertised 32 discs in the complete series. Very bad business Warner Brothers. It's obvious that you must have had a disgruntled employee that sabotaged your product. Unfortunately, I and the many other buyers who paid well over $100.00 for ALL dvds of Full House The Complete Series got stolen from. Not good. Not happy."
4,Sobre los Subtitulos en ESPAÑOL [About the Spanish Subs],"this review is thinking in the SPANISH SPEAKING:only the first 5 seasons includes spanish subtitlesS6-S8 only english subtitles. S7 only [CC] none subtitlesWHAT A MISS! can you call to this DVD edition a FULL PROFFESIONAL one?---EL PAQUETE ACABA DE LLEGAR! es una hermosa cajita (por su altura no cabe en mi estante para dvds!) la calidad es excelente, el menu entretenido, los episodios comodamente divididos por capitulos,el unico ""PERO"" es que:Solamente las primeras 5 temporadas estan SUBTITULADAS AL ESPAÑOLla temporada 6 no incorpora subtitulo alguno (solo [CC] en ingles)la temporada 7 incorpora solo subtitulos en INGLESla temporada 8 incorpora solo subtitulos en INGLESEspero que esto les ayude a la hora de determinar la compra.saludos"
2,"Difficult, Innacurate, but Topical",The textbook is difficult to understand and many of the answers in the back of the book are wrong. Also it addresses lots of good topics but mostle hard to understand.
2,"Canned methods, sloppy....","THe credentials of the authors speak in bounds... Drexel University and Georgia Perimeter College???!?!?! GPC is a 2-year. Anyways, all that aside, the presentation of the material is horrible. Obviously, the background of these authors is that of 1,2,3 methods, with absolutely no concept of any concepts behind the material. The problems/examples are unrelated to the material in the chapters, and no preparation was given to answer them. Our professor even said that he emailed the writer to change the wording in a few questions, the writer agreed wholeheartedly, and yet the question remained in the next edition....IN the age of Chubb Institute and quickie-degree schools, this book would do fine. Math, in my opinion, while can be learned with these methods, is useless without the knowledge of how it came about, why it is used, and theory or explanation/background. This book provides none of this. I do not recommend it to anyone. ESPECIALLY not one of ""beginner"" status(...)"
1,Avoid this book at all costs,"Discrete math is difficult enough without having to hire a translator to do your homework. Yet, this is exactly what the authors want you to do. Math is supposed to fun and challenging, not insanely difficult. If you are going to purchase this textbook, please take heed an make reservations at the nearest mental hospital."
2,Not the best math textbook,"As a comprehensive book on discrete math I really found this text lacking. At times some examples were vaguely illustrated or maybe omitted altogether.If you're using this for a discrete math class, hopefully your instructor has enough supplemental material to carry the text, but I'm not as lucky. Doing an independent study of the course that used this text meant using Google a lot.I also have the next edition, and I can say that there is hardly a difference as far as the lack of examples and overall clarity."
1,Great! If you already know the material...,"According to an instructor of mine (not the one teaching the course), this book was written by mathematicians for mathematicians. If you are not already well-versed in proofs and logic, this book is excruciatingly difficult to follow. The instructor teaching the course was a Ph.D. from MIT. Obviously he understands it, but both he and the book utterly failed to explain the concepts in terms that a normal computer engineer/scientist undergraduate could understand. If this is required reading for you Discrete Structures (or equivalent course) I highly recommend getting a second book that explains the terms in plain English (as opposed to in the language of Math, which I am not fluent in). Unfortunately I was not smart enough to do this myself early on, so I cannot provide a recommendation. Suffice it to say I learned my lesson and I hope my experience benefits you."
2,Not recommended for beginners,"It appears the authors created this book for people with prior knowledge of Discrete Structures. Most of the exercises require you to research in other places which defeats the purpose of this textbook! In a class I recently took, most of the students actually complained about the college using this book because it makes the subject look harder than it already is."
4,laptop,Unfortuneately didnt keep it. Although arrived with great timing and since it was in thirty days of purchase had no problem returning it.
4,"For the Money, Great Deal!","Recieved the product ahead of schedule, which was a suprise since I opted for the free shipping option. The knives are of reasonably good quality, My only real complaint is that the wood in the handles is not particularly well finished. I know I can't expect Rolls Royce for Chevy prices, however they should have stepped to the next finer grade of sandpaper at least. Aside from that complaint, they all arrived nicely sharp and the steel appears to be of good quality, if not overly polished. Fuctionally they handle well and seem to hold an edge reasonably well(time will tell). The block is of decent quality, not great, but decent. Asthetics aside you will have to spend quite a bit more to beat these knives. I have some Henkels (5 star) single knives, aside from better finish, they aren't a huge jump except in price."
1,Missing Pieces,"The knives are of good quality, however the boning knife was missing from the order. I am not happy with the customer service."
3,Beware the scissors!,"We are enjoying the knives and have no complaints ... but the scissors are the kind that you can separate the blades. I guess that's for better cleaning. However, the scissors can easily come apart in your hands if you are a little clumsy. Three times we have had half a scissor take a half gainer into our kitchen floor. Luckily the cats were not prowling below each time. We have gone back to our screwed-together scissors, which fit quite nicely in the scissors slot of the block."
4,Short term - great; Long term - remains to be seen,"I bought this on the lightning deal offer. The set works beautifully. If you are not careful, you could end up cutting off the tips of your fingers (I have done so twice). The four stars is due to the fact that the handles are not as smooth and polished as I expected them to be."
1,Junk junk JUNK,"Wood is splintering before they were even washed! Blades rusting, rivets coming loose. This is nowhere NEAR the quality of the company in the early 1990s, which was amazing (I have the 400T set, whatever its called, beautiful buffed gloss wood, full tang blades, razor-ground edge, sharper than anything in my antique razor collection!).Even the block is JUNK. These people that gave it 3+ stars have been conditioned by $20 knife sets and haven't seen quality like my old set. This isnt even worth $20!I ended up using them, taking 1 to work each time I needed one, and throwing them away instead of even washing them. Not even worth recycling. Put it in the landfill!"
1,So disappointed!!!,"I bought these knives for my best friend. She has a very busy job and 4 kids so I act as her personal shopper sometimes. This is the first item that I've purchased for her that I'm embarrassed to have done so. I trusted the Chicago Cutlery name (and the previous reviews!), but no more.Within the first week of use they began rusting. Then I went to visit her, was chopping up broccoli for dinner, and the blade of the small knife I was using broke in half! I have never broken a knife while using it before. And on broccoli???I urged her to return the set, but in her busy life she had not saved the paperwork or packaging. Very disappointing."
5,Excellent Quality,These knives keep their edge exceptionally well. Have used a set (I'm acutally on my second set) for over twenty years. Just use the steel periodically!
5,Substantial knife set at a budget price point,"In the overall scheme of things, this knives are cheap for the number of knives you get at the price point. I grew up in a household where we couldn't have a sharp knife because my mother would always slice her fingers open. Some 20 years later, a heavy sharp knife feels amazing when you're using it! Must be something about the mother thing, but I can imagine when cutting chicken that the blade is going right through my finger, bone and all. Which I think that most of these knives would be fully capable of doing!I recommend that you use a sharpening kit like this for sharpening any knife:Smith's DFPK Diamond Precision Knife Sharpening KitThese kits are amazing and will put a professional edge on any knife. You can adjust the angle of the sharpening edge, down to the razor thin edge like an X-Acto blade."
2,Low end of the quality knife market,"I've had my set for almost ten years; they're nice (better than Farberware ""never-sharpen"" serrated) but not the best. They're working fine for me now, but when it comes time to replace them, I'll go with a Global.I also prefer the wood to the plastic handles-- the plastic doesn't feel as good.FWIW, I use the steel every time, and have had them professionally sharpened once, after about 6 years. And of course, they don't go in the dishwasher."
3,Nice Knives,"I have used this brand before and like them, however the set arrived with one knife missing, as this was a gift and i didn't check it before hand this was kind of embarrassing. Amazon refunded me for the missing knife without any problem."
1,and then there was boredom,this dvd is just a bunch of old friends and hangers on to AC/DC jibbering about the good old days. very disappointing
1,HORRIBLE - DO NOT BUY!!!!,"This dvd is terrible. You can tell the second you pop it in. The menu page graphic is terrible and then you have the text that appears that says it all...""This DVD does not include any AC/DC music"" What the hell is that? This is basically someone making money by just interviewing anyone who has an opinion about AC/DC. Basically think of you interviewing your friend about the band, throwing in some stock photos and selling it to any chump who thinks its an actual AC/DC DVD with AC/DC music."
1,kentucky,This dvd had nothing do to with AC/DC at all. It was boring and drab. I want to return this dvd. I felt like I was ripped off.
2,Disappointing,"As a huge AC/DC fan who saw Bon with them in 78 before they really made it in America, this is not what I expected. It is only for the fan who absolutely has to have every bit of footage ever released on this band. If you simply like the band and want their best; get the Stiff Upper Lip DVD. I have watched that more than any other DVD I own, and saw the concert live."
2,Lacked something,"This book is suppose to be about the Marines and the Semper Fi code they live by but most of these storys don't show that, while some do most are like openings or middle sections of books which make them not fitting for this perticular book. I think the editor and writer didn't really put the book together as well as they could have and the stories as well. It isn'ta bad book book but defintinely not a good book so that is why it only got a 2 star rating from me. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they wanted to be put to sleep by most of it. NOt a good pick to give to anyone joining the marines or a former marine"
1,Semper Fi,Story was so far fetched and written like all marines are have no grasp on the English language and are a bunch of idiots. An insult to ALL the Marines.
1,Works great until it dies.,I purchased this unit 3 years ago and it worked fairly well until it completey died. I have a friend who had the exact same switch for the same amount of time and his died within a month of mine. Dont plan on getting more than 3 years use out of this switch.
2,Ports failing after a few years,"We've had this for about 3 and a half years now and 5 of the ports have gone bad. Because of that, the switch itself is slow and intermittent. We'll be replacing it immediately, but not w/another D-Link product for sure."
2,"Not outstanding, then problems!","We had this switch for about a year. It worked well, but was not exceptional. This week, two of our workstations couldn't connect to the server. The problem turned out to be that several ports on the switch had gone bad. I've uplinked a spare hub to the DSS-16+ and things are working fine for now. I plan do some research and get a more reliable switch."
1,"Fast, but prone to fail","I picked up a DSS 16+ switch and it definitely improved our network of 14 computers. We were using the two uplinks. I purchased the system in January and it has a 3 year warranty.Yesterday, it died completely. We lost all our ports. You cannot get through D-Link tech support by phone, and e-mail has been slow to get an RMA.In retrospect, I think the slightly more expensive Link-Sys switches may be manufactured with better quality control.Pete"
4,Cheap Trick still rocks,All their best songs and a few I had forgotten they sang. Definitely a great addition to my MP3 library of songs.
4,Pretty Good,"Music is awesome, of course. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the annoying screaming woman near the microphone in the live track."
2,A Terrible Representation of Cheap Trick,"Cheap Trick was one of the finest rock bands of the late 70s. However, their best material is omitted on this CD and the greatest sin of all is that there is not one song pulled from their phenomenal, yet under recognized debut. Skip this CD and fork out the extra cash to buy either all of their first five albums or a compilation that presents Cheap Trick as they truly were in their golden years, prior to the embarrassing 80s tripe; you will not be disappointed."
5,spiders,"This is a really good spider moviethat I saw.It has gore,creatureviolence,action,terror,explosions.And the most important thing a happyending.So do more good reviews for thismovie ok."
1,HORRIBLE,"I have seen a lot of bad movies in my day, but I honestly have to say that SPIDERS is THE WORSE film I have EVER seen in my life. I am a film critic, so I give movies a break when they have low budgets, but it seemed to me that when they got the idea to make this movie, they just started, and began making the plot (and the special effects) as they went along. The acting is bad, the effects are terrible, the directing is silly, and the plot is sub standard (even for this genre). There was actually a scene where it looked like the Spider was made of paper and they just walked it by the camera on a stick. It took every thing in me not to turn it off and throw it in the trash. If you have an enemy and you want to torture them, send this movie as a gift. Humm, what is my boss' address, anyway?"
4,A Very enjoyable B-Grade Movie,"When I bought this movie, I had low expectations. But once I saw it, it amazed me. It exceeded all my expectations and I had a fun time watching it. The spider (even though it says Spiders, there is only one), grows from a small, creepy arachnid into a giant two storey beast. The final rampage was fantastic even though you could tell the spider isn't there when the cgi was used. But my favorite size would have to be the 6 foot tall one. It munched on many victims and even a good use of blood is in here too. Perfect for a Friday/Saturday Night with a few mates. Give it a shot."
4,I was impressed,"For a b-movie this was good, I enjoyed it, the acting was decent and the effects I think were pretty realistic, not all computer special effects, kind of like the ones used in aliens, well machines if you will make it look more realistic. But just want to add something if anybody knows Jonathon Breck the guy who played Jacobs in this movie also played the monster in Jeepers Creepers, which is awesome, just wanted to add that. I say though if anyone likes aliens and arachnophobia im sure youll enjoy this, Of course 8 legged freaks will prob. be 10 times better, but still this is a good movie, enjoy."
1,the budget wasn't big,"if the budget to this movie were big(which it wasn't)the speacial effects woouldn't be so obvous that it was computer aminted. the expolisions in this film are SO fake you can tell they're computer aminatied! this movie is ... i caught it on the sci-fi channel it seemed more of a rip off of alien only using spiders!the movie doesn't contain good dialog at all it's all very corny and even these ""actors"" can't act like they're trying to convense the viewer they feel the way they do.skip this film it's too chessy!"
3,Better than expected,"A straight-to-video release, but not badly done. The spider actually looks better as it gets bigger, from two to thirty feet long. The two foot spider is extremely plastic looking, as it is tossed around the set on wires, but the six, and finally thirty foot spider, are done well, with the latter tearing across streets and parking lots, eating cars along the way! The synopsis on the back of the DVD case was unpromising, as the story is ridiculous, with secret govt. bases and crashing space shuttles, but it played out better than it read. This is a fun, well made B-movie, worth checking out!"
3,LAME SCRIPT BUT OK EFFECTS,"SPIDERS (Trimark) and ARACHNID (Lions Gate) are a perfect double creature feature. As you might guess big spiders dominate these two low budget flicks. In Spiders, a college newspaper reporter is assigned to cover the space shuttle landing. When the shuttle crash-lands, they sneak into a restricted area and stumble upon a secret (is there any other kind?) government experiment that has, as they say, gone horribly wrong. Spiders have been injected with alien DNA and now, as is always the case in such matters, there's hell to pay. Arachnid has a group of scientists on a secret mission crash-landing on a South Pacific island where alien spiders run rampant. Both films have some pretty good jolts, but the lame, predictable stories weaken some of the better special effects."
2,Weak movie with weaker ending,"This movies not scary, not funny and not camp. It's just a poor movie. Our top secret military installations have the worst security I've ever seen-easily breached by three wannabe college journalists. Then, as typical in these type movies, the secret computer files are hacked into by our 3 ""heroes"" in a matter of seconds. There's really nothing about this movie to recommend. It's not even a worthwhile rental. The ending is really dumb, with the police watching helplessly, as the heroine dangles from a helicopter by a rope, armed with an armor piercing bazooka firing at the ""spider"" on a skyscraper-which one would think would be full of people, even if it's night-there are bound to be maintenance workers. Hey--so what--let the girl, who has lost her glasses as well, take her shot at the monster what are a few dozen casualties if she misses! One thing about this movie-you'll be glad when it's over!"
3,Movie stands out in my mind...,"Honestly, I haven't seen this movie in over 20 years but it sticks out as one of the creepiset things I have seen. I remember images of people in glass coffins and waving. Very scary for a youngster. I wonder what I would think about it if I saw it today"
2,Sleep-inducing campy horror,"A group of frog-worshipping British bikers learn that the secret to returning from the dead is as simple as wishing you won't die really, really hard when you commit suicide. There's no gore, the zombie bikers look exactly the same as they did before they died, and there's nothing even remotely scary going on here. It's all done with a droll British manner, and is perhaps tongue-in-cheek, but it simply isn't funny enough to really care. There's a reason why movies like this were shown on late night TV - they put most people to sleep!"
1,Warning: scene missing on Geneon DVD,"The Geneon edition of this DVD is missing the seance scene. This scene introduces Shadwell and the mom and shows the mom's psychic ablilities, showing what she gets out of Shadwell's presence. So it's kind of important. (It also shows why she's sleeping in a chair.) It's only two or three minutes long, but it shouldn't be missing!!!"
4,psychomania-crazy english hells angels,a very silly british film which is also great fun. a gang of hells angels decide that if you kill yourself while expecting to come back to life then that is just what will happen. and once they become invincible hells angels what do they do? take over the world? no-they visit the local supermarket and push over piles of baked beans etc! also featuring an amusingly bad folk song scene-and these guys are supposed to be hells angels! so it's an awful film right? put it this way-i'm buying it!
3,It was very weird!,"I thought if it had had more gore and blood it would have been great, But it was still very funny and was good."
3,"A ""classic"" plot delivered in a cult classic budget.","What a wonderful story, the search for eternal life. This film however, takes an unusual twist. No flowing fountain of youth in this one. You have to want to live forever so bad that you give your life. Questionable acting, rough film quality, strange handling of storylines, can not take away from the ""Lost Boy "" attraction of this film. How can cheap English motorcycles put through their paces, hard core English wannabees doing themselves in, and ketchup gore be bad. It can't. This story has stuck with me since I was 9. Staying up late that night watching this movie on some obscure cable channel has haunted me ever since. This is pure entertainment at its best. Not for those who like ""Titanic"", but maybe a ""Repo Man"" fan could appreciate."
5,Classick,"I never thought I would see this move in DVD format and was very happy to find it. If you are into freaky, hippie, 60's, horror, biker movies, you have to see this!"
3,Fun 70's horror,"This is a fun film that few people know about. It has to do with a motorcycle gang who commit a group suicide and return from the dead to wreak havoc. Not too much violence, but the film has touches of the ambience that some 70's horror films managed to capture. More than that, it's great campy fun with some good laughs, as only the British can do."
3,Disappointed,"The book did not come with the deck of cards, so I could not do a reading. So, I was disappointed in my purchase."
5,A Great Place to Start,"OK, I'll start by saying that Bill Wilson is a friend of mine, but having said that, I probably wouldn't have become friends with him if he didn't do top quality research, teaching and fencing.Bill's book isn't the final word on rapier fencing, but it is a pretty good place to start. It also isn't really a how-to guide. It explores the basic concepts and principles of all rapier fencing and shows a large number of sample actions in clear photographs. What this book will do more than anything is to help you to understand the rapier and to know where to go after you finish the book. It will certainly prevent you from making any of the common mistakes seen amongst rapier fencers. This is an extremely useful book for anyone interested in rapier fencing, particularly beginners. I commend Bill on a job well done and look forward to his planned work on the Bolognese sidesword (early rapier) school."
4,Excellent basis on Italian Rapier,"I've spent a while now looking for a book covering the basics of thrust orientated Italian rapier. I've met William several times and worked with him, so was pre-disposed to buy the book anyway.It is excellent, though not an advanced manual -- something the book admits, recommending that from here you obtain a translation and work for that. The basics include photographs, drills, terminology and description for developing the period style, as well as an introduction to the masters.I'd recommend it to anyone interested in SCA style fencing or a more serious Western Martial Art."
5,The Joyous Cosmology,"My best friend let me borrow 'The Joyous Cosmology' and I read it in 2 hours. An intellegent perspective of such things was very interesting to read because most of the time when you hear about Acid, Mescaline, and shrooms, all you hear is a bunch of incohearent praise with nothing to back it up. With a scientific understanding of it, I would feel a lot safer doing such things. A super book!"
5,Entheogens: Professional Listing,"""The Joyous Cosmology"" has been selected for listing in ""Religion and Psychoactive Sacraments: An Entheogen Chrestomathy."" http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy"
1,Worst Experience Ever,"I wanted to use this lens with my Canon EOS-10D and I was shocked with its performance. The AF only works for objects closer than 4 feet and it does not focus on objects farther than that. First, Sigma told me that the serial number I bought was old and the lens needed updating for it to work with Canon digital SLR Cameras. I have no idea why they distribute outdated lenses to their resellers.. That's not all, I tried manual focus, and the photos came out very soft even at very small apertures (large f-stop number)After 4 weeks I get the lens back from Sigma in the same condition. I can only call this horrible service and a very bad product.My recommendation is pay a little extra and either go for the Canon EF 15mm f/2.8 fisheye or the Canon EF 17-40mm f/4 (which I did)."
2,out of date,I thought the text was somewhat out of date. It is geared for the classroom teacher and young ages. Buy cheap or rent at library.
3,I only have eyes for you,I only wanted one song of this CD: I Only Have Eyes For You....it's great !!! The rest are pretty good also.
3,Pretty good most of the time,This switch works most of the time. Occasionally it registers no keyboard or mouse. It also occasionally doubles keystrokes when I'm typing.
5,Cute charm!!,It arrived in a timely manner and it's just the right size for my charm bracelet. It's very pretty and thanks so much!
4,Dynamite!!!,"Perfect 70s exploitation! Its a super low-budget mobster film about a Vietnam soldier turned hitman. Like other Williamson-directed films, its fun and simple but has alot of interesting qualities to it. It moves slow, but its never boring. Great moments include a ""special guest appearance"" by Williamson's ""M*A*S*H"" co-star Elliot Gould. As soon as Gould appears its obvious the two are having a lot of fun improvising the scene which has nothing to do with the story. Roddy McDowall gets little screen time but his effeminate British persona translates into a very strange mobster. Also, the ending is mind-blowing. Great late night viewing material."
4,Classic Fred Williamson,"Early, low-budget Fred Williamson flick...one of the first movies of the period to address the plight of the American G.I. returning from Vietnam to a country that reviled him or just didn't give a damn. Some of the dialogue is weak and the production value is pretty low (as is typical in the genre) but the message and the pure entertainment value make this one worth adding to your blaxploitation collection."
4,Fascinating look at biggest News Story of the Post War era,"The premise is that due to certain inconsistencies in the surviving records, the producers, spoken for by Elliot Gould, accuse the Soviet Union of fraud in their Vostok program of putting a man in space, and they seriously question whether Yuri Gagarin ever went into orbital flight.They argue strongly, and bring various ""witnesses"" to support their version of events, but I feel they have not done a sufficiently convincing job to upset the official account, nor to dethrone Gagarin from being the USSR's biggest hero of their entire history. However, the movie is crammed full of really cool historical trivia, and many images pulled from Gagarin's 7 years of glory prior to his tragic death in the test-flight crash of a Mig-15 in 1968.This is a very educational, and engaging look at the Russian side of the Space Race of the 1960's, and I've already watched it 3 times, and expect to watch it several more times as my time permits."
3,"Nice pictures, lovley words, but not a gardener's helper.","Mary Englebreit has a very definitive look, and the pages of this book are filled with lovely photos that embody her style perfectly. Pictures aside, this book is not a very helpful gardening tool, since the captions do not indicate what types of flowers or plants have been used to make up the great settings pictured. The book's cover states that the reader will be shown how to obtain ""the look"", but one can't very well do that if no where does it say what flowers are used, can they? Over all, nice to look at, but not a big help ."
5,Great visual,I already had this book but had given it away! It was great to be able to get another copy of it! Thanks!
2,"Good performance, but.....","Ansermet's Handel is, I sure, beautifully drawn and the playing of the Decca Strings (surely a pick-up group) is quite lovely, but damned if I can hear much of it. Though the recording boasts a good bass foundation, all of the soft passages are swallowed up by the horrendous amount of surface noise that was left by transfer engineer, Seth Winner.I have high esteem for the bulk of Mr. Winner's work on historical recordings, but this one is just too noisy for me. I have not heard the Lys issue of these performances, but perhaps it would be best to seek that one out."
1,wrong bottle,"The brand you sent was correct , but the bottle i recived is different from what i ordered. It is to late to exchange Iwill be going back to Asia in three days."
1,Item is NOT what it says it is!,"This is NOT a genuine HP cartridge! It is a remanufactured generic cartridge! This item is currently advertised as a genuine HP cartridge, however what the seller is sending is remanufactured generic toner."
4,Supa!,"Inspired? No. A cheesy band name? Undoubtedly. Bad? Don't jump to conclusions! This is bluesy, fun, rock n' roll. This band doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, which is a nice change of pace. But they do take the music seriously, and have written some thoroughly enjoyable songs."
5,Great book,"Out of all the Jack the Ripper books I have read, this one stood out as being thoroughly researched and executed with simplicity and common sense. Mr. Paley does a great job of presenting his case and he doesn't torture the facts to suit his theories. Too often, the theories of Ripperologists are as outlandish as the original murders. Joseph Barnett was skilled with a knife, no doubt, and Mr. Paley wields Occam's Razor with the same finesse and brutal precision. I borrowed the book on Amazon Prime, and then turned right around and bought it because the author deserves the support."
1,The Kindle version is an absolute disaster!,"All other reviews are about theprinted version and I agree with them that the book itself is quite good and interesting and well written. But the Kindle version is plain awful. There are several errors on each page that accounts for a very basic and amateurish scan and OCR conversion that nobody bother to check in just a few pages. In parts you can not read it as the meaning is completely ruined.Onm a printed bbok I would surely demand a refund as it is a faulty, damaged product that it does not make justice to the author. If I were the author I would demand that the digital version corresponds in all integrity to the written version.Stick to the written version and stay away from this!"
3,Don't miss this book,"I read Mr Ressler's book on criminal profiling a short while ago. Creepy,but effective."
4,Great value for money - Hitachi CPX5,I work in adult education and I needed a projector for my class activities. The Hitachi projector has been very simple to use... plug and play with my mac. The size of the projection is great. The projector does not get overly hot as some projectors tend to after 2 hours of continuous use. I love that it is quite lightweight which makes it easy to carry around. So far I am satisfied with my purchase.
5,Blue Buried Skies,"These Guys are killer.Catchy grooves and riffs.Their music seems to be guitar riff based and well put together.Dave has a killer voice range and a cool style, this band is a MUST see for any live performances i might add.Check out their other CD's like:Mondobizzaro, and Juggernaut. These guys need to find the right manager to push them to the top,Cause they are worthy of it.They need to get Nicky back on guitar somehow and get him shredding again. Good luck in the future Boys- You rock!"
2,"Half political history, half airpower history","I bought this book after reading some of the brilliant articles written by James Corum for the USAF official magazine. I rate this book with only two stars, because if one knows the history of various insurgencies of the past, can easily avoid reading half of the pages.Corum and Johnson did not go deep in details, so the book remains just a general historical overview of the phenomenon of airpower against insurgents, even forgetting some minor wars (Sri Lanka against Tamils, Russia against Chechens, Morocco against Saharawis and so on).Moreover, in the chapter dedicated to Colombia the two authors give an explicit negative political judgement on Clinton politics and overtly claim an American military intervention in the ongoing Colombian civil war: mixing politics with an academic work is not a good thing."
1,Someone should have shot the entire wedding party...,"This book, like the others in this series that I have read, can hardly be termed ""murder mysteries."" The protagonist, Lucy Stone, never seem to solve the crimes. Instead, she accidnetly blunders into trouble and the murderer then promptly attacks or kidnaps her.Like may readers, a book is as escape for me into another world. Lucy Stone's world is one I do not intend to visit again. Her harried supermom performance, coupled with an inability to say no, makes her such a victim that I end up rooting for the bad guys. Her children are lazy brats who manage to get into all sorts of trouble. Her husband is insecure and selfish. Her friends think nothing of imposing on her. If reading this book is a ""break,"" it's a painful one.Save your money."
4,Enjoyable reading,"The whole Lucy Stone series is very enjoyable reading. Lucy is a very regular person with family issues that could apply to alot of people. Sometimes I wish she could have a nicer time of things, but then the story wouldn't be the same. The mysteries she solves are not huge conundrums, but I like to get an idea of who the killer might be before the last page sometimes! Not every mystery book needs to be the end-all of stories--just fun and easy is nice, too. And her series is definitely that. If you are looking for deep darkness, this is not it. But if you want a likable character and easy flowing story, here you go."
3,Not as well done as others in series,"This is a usually first-rate, warm and lively series with an engrossingly charming heroine. All of the books are well done. I waited for a good month for my library to get WEDDING DAY MURDER. Must admit, however, this is the book which deserves the title of ""not as good as the others."" The characters are NOT as well drawn as usual, our heroine, Lucy Stone, isn't her usual 'cope with it' self, and there's simply a flavor of a book done hurriedly and without the usual charming touches."
2,As big as an elephants head,"This mask is enormously big and won't fit anybody. There is no person who will be able to say it fits. I am 25years old guy, 5'11"" and 175lb and this mask is twice as big as my head. I will not recommend this mask to anybody except if you buy it only to hand it on the wall.Mask look ok, has some hair, but size ruins everything. 2 stars is best for it"
5,"5 stars for the artist, none for the listing.","If you're actually looking Joe Jones, you'll never find him on the Amazon search, as the false ""Boogaloo"" (another Joe Jones), ruins it. (I put his name and a song title up on ""Scroogle"" to get here.) For those of you old enough to remember ""California Sun"" by the Rivieras,('64?), you're gonna -love- the original 1961 version. For one thing, the real words are way better, and the band is tighter and funkier. (I guess the Riv's record company paid out more payola, because -this- should have been the bigger hit, if music had anything to do with it.) ""You Talk too Much"", of course, was the hit, but everything else on this CD is as good or better."
3,Mistaken listing again,"This is not Joe ""Boogaloo"" Jones.This Joe Jones is fun tho, and his ""California Sun"" (which predates the Riviera's version is hot.""You Talk Too Much"" is a hilarious almost monolog. It spawned several ""answer"" songsSeveral other nice tunes, he reminds me a bit of Fats Domino. Too bad it's out of print. The big hit (You Talk Too Much) can be found on VA compilations tho.Amazon should pay us amateurs for correcting all these mistaken listings"
4,Great product for your Cannon,"When I bought my Canon Elan II I opted for the Sigma lens over the Canon lens. What I based my decion on was that the Sigma Lens, although it does not have the second chip in it to make the whisper focus, it does come with the Macro feature, which with a flip of a switch, you can focus on things three inches from the lens, allowing for some great close-ups with flowers and other subjects. I consider it well worth your money, besides the whisper focus is not really worth the extra bucks."
4,Great Cookbook,"This book has great pictures so I knew how my sushi was supposed to look! The instructions were fairly easy to follow as well. I still need some practice, but for a beginner I am pleased with this book!"
4,"Good Recipes, Easy-to-Read Layout","The book is nicely laid out and easy to read. It's a good choice for someone new to sushi and looking for a starter book. There are a wide variety of recipe types, for vegetarians, for example, but not a lot of recipes. There are many good photographs for learning sushi techniques."
4,great pictures,This book gives a broad scope of sushi types and has wonderful pictures to assist you.
3,"good, but not great","This book shows some nice homes but, the point of the book is not based on design but on square footage.So if your looking for a book based on design only, u might try another book"
3,wish i read more of the reviews,"The book is lovely, but not at all what I was hoping for, which was inspiration for a building a small home. All these homes seem like no one lives in them...big empty rooms with hardly and furnishings. I was also hoping for ideas for using space more effectively but I don't think this was the book for that. I agree with the other review that this book was all about vacation homes."
3,"Overall, A good book for the layperson.","25 Houses is an overall good book for the layperson. It's successful in showing that well-designed custom homes don't always have to be enormous. However, it lacks in depth for those who are looking for ""how it was done"". This book would really shine if there was information about materials used, custom details or the inspiration behind the designs.Also, there are a few examples of ordinary houses that, in my opinion, shouldn't be in this publication."
4,fun,"I love the large format of this book. The houses were interesting, big beautiful pictures, a lot of fun to look at. If you can consider it a down side i would say i would have personally enjoyed more practicality of house and i felt i have seen these houses or something very similar before. For modern houses i found them a little garish. Of course i have a lot of similar books."
1,dissapointing,"I'm very glad I did not spend my money on this DVD. I had heard of it, then checked it out from the library. This movie was not well made. It absolutely could not hold the attention of my 1 year old. He loves his Baby Einstein movie & I hoped this DVD would be on par with that, but it is not. They do not seem to have a grasp on what kind of images will hold the attention of babies. There is one song where the whole song just shows a little girl kneeling next to a teddy bear, and she just picks and pulls at the bear the whole time. Unbelievable. The whole thing was painful for me to watch, and my 1 yr. old found better things to do. An older child might sit still for this (my 6 year old did watch it through, but she did not ask to see it again after that). It's a great concept, but they need to go back to the drawing board."
5,Rada tomato slicer knife,I happened upon this knife when looking for a granny knife. Love it! Been using it for several years. Gave one to each of my four children. I never put it in dishwasher. Great for cutting small fruit and hardboiled eggs. And the price is right.
5,Excellent Item and Service,"This is the second Rada Tomato Slicer I've purchased from this seller, and I had it sent to a friend. It's a quality item at a very reasonable price, and the service was exceptional."
2,Hate it!,"I'm really surprised at all the great reviews of this knife. The blade is plenty sharp, although a little skinnier than I prefer. But I knew that when I bought it. My biggest issue is that the handle is SO wimpy! It's not much bigger than the blade itself and I find it extremely uncomfortable to hold. I feel like I have no control over the knife and it makes me nervous that it will slip and cut my other hand. I don't think I'll be keeping this one."
5,THANK YOU RADA AND AMAZON!,"I had a little tomato/citrus knife for years that I used every day. It was perfect for sectioning grapefruit, slicing tomatoes and celery, and cutting lemon wedges. When it disappeared, I panicked! Panic turned to surprise and delight when I found this little gem. Actually, I bought two so I could hide one, just in case.I did consider the plastic handles because of other reviewers, but I'm glad I went with the brushed aluminum. It feels good in my hand and gives me a better grip when my hands are messy. I ALWAYS wash and dry my knives immediately after use, so I hope discoloration won't be an issue, but this is such a great knife I don't really care!I'm officially a Rada convert and can't wait to get the starter sets, steak knives, and sharpener. Super quality, American made, and you just can't beat the price! I wish somebody would give me a bunch of Rada stuff as a gift. I'd be absolutely thrilled!"
4,one sharp knife,"I purchased this knife for two reasons: I wanted a knife that would cut tomatoes without hassle and Rada's seemed inexpensive. I read in a couple of other reviews to watch out, that this knife was awfully sharp. But despite being quite slow and careful, I sliced my middle finger badly the first time I used the knife. All's well now, or I would have hated this knife. I think the handle's somewhat short for the length of the blade but that is the only drawback so far. The handle hasn't discoloured for me, as some reviewers mentioned. (I have never put it in the dishwasher; I rinse it quickly in running water and wipe it with a little towel. The knife cleans fine). The knife makes cutting tomatoes and lemons seamless but the blade is really, really sharp. Buy it if you want to spend as little as you can to get a reasonably good tomato-knife."
5,Excellent for the money,"Fantastic knife, great for slicing any produce including tomatoes. I don't have a dishwasher and wash by hand, and the handle has not discolored so far (used every day for 1 month so far)."
5,Great product,"This knife replaced one that came from my mother-in-law and that was worn out from hard use. It's just exactly what I was looking for. The serrated edge is very sharp, the point is sharp, and the blade is flexible. The carved blade makes it perfect for slicing tomatoes. I debated trying to put a new handle on the old blade because I loved it so much, but I'm glad I ordered this knife instead."
5,Great knives!,"RADA knives are great for cutting anything and everything! Super sharp, and precise! This knife will cut everything from veggies to raw meat!"
5,My go to knife for tomatoes,I LOVE this knife for tomatoes. Don't let the price fool you. THis is a QUality knife that is excellent for slicing tomatoes.
5,Here It Is,"We laughed at it in the 60s - then spent decades trying to find it again. Charming, psychedelic corn. Have a 60s party!"
3,Classic Album but Volume Compressed,"Great classic music but poorly remastered onto CD!I own both the original album and this CD. The album has full dynamic range with excellent sound. Unfortuately this CD was run through a volume compression device that lowers the loud passages while raising the soft passages of the music. The result is a ""louder"" but far less interesting recording. If you are listening to this CD in a car, with the windows open, you might like the volume compression, as it allows you to hear the music over loud background noise. But otherwise this is a serious type of audio distortion that is present in many recent CDs."
5,I didn't think they'd have THIS one!,"Fine assemblage of sounds befitting the 1967 scene. Some truly unique sounds from esoteric instruments, and some of the first uses of electronic(moog type) instruments. Good music, narrated, not sung or rapped, one ""song"" for each of the twelve signs. And, if you are into astrology, you'll have more to talk about. (I don't know enough about it to critique it, but my own sign fits me fairly well)"
3,"Great to see on CD, but LP sound is better","It is really good to see some reviewers being honest about the sound. However, I imagine that few people have a turntable to say nothing about having a copy of the LP, although you can find it pretty easily and not too expensive. Just to have this on CD is a real good thing. It was considered pretty much exploito stuff at the time, but it was mildly interesting and worked well within certain radio formats. The music is a good example of the times."
3,Fits very small !!!,"This is such a beautiful suit, unfortunately, fits so small, it looks silly. I am a size 8 or 9, ordered the large, fits like a size 5 or 6. So disappointed."
1,Cracked Handles,"I ordered these knives and received 1 knife with a cracked handle. Amazon sent a replacement and all 4 handles were cracked in the same location. In addition, 2 of the replacement knives were cracked in 2 locations."
1,NOT AS REPRESENTED,"everything previous reviewer wrote is correct. My wheels are black, much more dust than OEM. These are not ceramic pads as advertised and as shown on box they came in."
3,not what you think it is...,"There are only about 2 commercials that have Red in them on this DVD...the other commercials are just those originally aired with his show, but cut out of the DVD releases. A nice bit of TV commercial history, but not for those looking for commercials starring Red. This DVD was originally a bonus disc with the ""Unreleased"" set."
4,An enjoyable mystery,This is a well written mystery that takes place in Spain in the years following the country's civil war. A young man named Daniel becomes obsessed with a local author who disappeared during the height of the conflict. As Daniel unveils more facts about the author he comes to find that their lives parallel one another in many ways.I found the German translation to be somewhat challenging at times. The sentences can be quite long. Not a good book for beginning German students.
2,Disappointed,"This particular book does not cover ""America,"" but only California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico. When I have the opportunity to travel to these states, I think it will be somewhat helpful. I was dissapointed more of the U.S. was not covered."
2,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed.A collection of very short tales from the author's travels... Really not much of a theme running through it. I'm not sure what the author's objective was in writing it, other than to be able to tell people that he's writing a book. If you want to read about small town America, try Dayton Duncan's ""Miles from Nowhere"" or Jonathan Raban's ""Bad Land."""
5,Excellent book.,"A most entertaining book. I had trouble putting it down. Graves has an easy style which is always humble, insightful, and extremely well researched. It makes you want to hit the road today!"
1,The last scene had me laughing through my tears....,"This movie was not worth the $0.49 I paid to rent it. On the other hand the begining and end were hilarious, featuring ninjas jumping as high as 20 vertical ft. I've never seen so many weapons come out of thin air in any other movie."
5,The British and their music,This CD offers an excellent sampler of traditional British music. If you have watched Chariots Of Fire you will recognize Jerusalem By Parry(the final scene at Harold Abraham's funeral). This is a beautiful selection. The Tam O'Shanter Overture dispells the often unjustified characterization of the stuffy Englishman and is a rousing piece. All in all a very enjoyable CD. Buy it!
4,A beautiful CD!,"This one is for all those who want a splendid introduction to the music this CD offers. It would make a lovely Christmas present for the discriminating listener. My favorite is ""Jerusalem!"""
4,"Well, I'm still horrible - but it's not Living Language's fault","I'm just terrible at learning foreign languages. This CD set lets you go at your own pace, but you must be the type who learns well from rote memorization. I'm much better in a classroom, so while this system is helpful, it does not do as much for me as face-to-face schooling/tutoring does.The four stars is for the quality of the product - don't let my admission of how bad I am at learning dissuade you."
1,Portuguese Complete Course: Basic-Intermediate Compact Disc Edition,"The order I made should have a book and a CD, but only book was delivered. Even though I sent them an e-mail, but its response is extremely poor."
3,Complete Course is only Brazilian in the audio portion,"fyi - per living language, ""... the Complete Course is only Brazilian in the audio portion and both Brazilian and Continental in the book. In case you decide to continue on into more in-depth Portuguese, our Ultimate Portuguese has about 9 lessons out of 40 that are Continental (while the rest are Brazilian)."" Also, Portuguese In-Flight is only Brazilian."
5,best that i've found,"you have got2get this! it's fast, easy and you'll be speaking Portuguese soon! It has you repeat sounds, and unless you have a short attention span (like me) the quizzes are really easy."
3,Not what I was expecting...,"I was looking for a system that I could use in the car while I am commuting everyday. This is great for repetition and accent, however, without looking at the book, I can only guess at what they are talking about. I do speak Spanish, so the words that are similar to Spanish I can understand, but if I didn't, it would not be usefull at all."
5,exciting stuff,simply outstanding. must be listened to on CD with good sound to appreciate it. An must for every collector
4,Excellent!,"This is an excellent buy. Panasonic has been around for many, many, years and this cd player is great! It has the new NO SKIP feature which makes it nice to jog with or go bike riding! You can't turn on and off the skip protection because it is on all the time, so you don't forget to turn it on. And it has a wireless remote,(which comes in handy).This is a great cd player! I recommend this cd player to everyone!"
5,Great little gadget!,"I was looking for a new CD player since my other one broke a while ago. Anyways, this morning I was looking in the Target Sales Paper and found this CD player coupon on it. I thought it was pretty nice, and I checked other people's review before I bought this. Like the other reviews written here, this IS a great machine. I'm loving it! The sound quality is great, nice design, and the remote is pretty nice."
2,All items not included. Was listed as a car kit and came with nothing but ear buds.,"Was shipped fast and was useless when received. CD player works great but it is not a ""car kit"" when all you get with it is ear buds. The listing stated I would receive headphones, cd player, remote control, cassette tape adapter and a car charger. Informed seller and seller stated I had to click several links to get to the accurate description of the item. Discount Daves was the name of the seller. I am leaving state so I needed it fast but I got ripped off instead. Thanks Amazon."
1,It died much to young,"It was very good when first used. Tonight, it's dead as a doornail. Blast and (...)."
1,Was great at first...but soon couldn't play cd-r's,"I admit this cd player was great and worth its money at first, lightweight, cool-looking, and it didn't skip. But what I didn't know is that after 3 weeks, when I played my CD-R's I discovered that after about Track 5 it would play fuzzy and scratchy, basically not listenable. Well it was alright as long as I could play Regular cd's, but it was a pain. Ah but months later, I went to play a regualar cd, and it wouldn't play, It said ""NO DISK"" when there actually was a disk in there. It is now disabled and worthless. I suggest you try something else."
2,Neptune another Simon dud,"Alas another kids book. Not very detailed for this amateur astronomer. Some of the pictures were good, maybe 3 or 4 star. No real detailed reference information. I have seen Neptune many times with my telescope and would like detailed information on the planet without PHD math. Big print to fill up pages so little is said. I did learn a few things but not a good reference book. This book is for grade school kids, parents showing nice pictures and reading to their kids or the very beginner in Astronomy. Will give this book to my nephew for his mom to read to him after I find a more detailed reference book on Neptune. Please Simon can you also write about the planets for grownups wanting more detailed information."
5,Complete informations about game cock,"Very complete book about breeding, handling, preparing cocks. Also interesting for all the breeds over the world."
2,strange poems,I downloaded this to see what it was and I am not a big fan of poems but I thought I might like one or two of them. Not so much.
5,An excellent resouce and easy read.,"I have many books on the Blackhawk War. This book is very straightforward and deals with the Sauk/Fox history and way of life as it pertains to Blackhawk. It presents Blackhawk as a human being rather than ""the noble savage."" This book is impartial in it's presentation of the causes and effects of the Blackhawk War. It basically presents the facts without glorifying any party. It also deals with the aftermath of the ""last indian war east of the Mississippi."" I highly recommend this book to any fan of indian life or lore."
4,Good solid information,The book touches on enough information to give a firm understanding of the elements of a VPN. Some portions are somewhat redundant and certain explanations are a little difficult to grasp in the first reading. Overall I would recommend this book for anyone who would like an understanding of the issues surrounding a proper VPN deployment. The book seems to flow in the direction a compnay would take when implementing a VPN --- almost providing a blueprint for actions to take.
4,Well-written introduction to VPNs,"The author gives a very clear and thorough introduction to the different aspects of VPNs. I found the book rather IP centered and lacking QoS coverage. All the same, this must be one of the best and most usefull VPN books so far."
5,Radio Fyler Classic Red Scooter,I would recommend to others but keep in mind the height of the child.My granddaughter is 4 years old and is tall for her age and she has to almost bend over to hold the handles.
1,This scooter was NOT SAFE for my 5 year-old,"My son recv'd this scooter as a gift from grandparents. He initally rode it w/training wheels ON & his free leg/foot would usually get ""tripped"" up on the training wheels (they extend-out too far). The platform is too short (for my 5 yr old). My son recv'd three gashes/cuts to his ankles (on 3 different occasions) from the rear wheel screw/nut when trying to propel himself along (this is without trng wheels). He also got a cut on the inside part of his leg (near his ankle)from contact w/the metal sloping part (just behind the front wheel) when trying to lift it off/away a curb. After the 3rd incident, we dismantled it & threw it away."
4,Buying another one!,My three-year-old niece loves her scooter so much that I'm buying one for my friend's four-year-old son.
1,Not functional,"This is a very durable toy, however the turning radius is awful and as a result, the scooter is not very functional. My 5 year old got it for his birthday, tried it out a couple of times and hasn't touched it since. When he tries to ride it, he can only go in a straight line since you can barely turn the handlebars. Also, the platform is very high and that makes it dangerous for a young child who is lifting their foot on/off the ground to push the schooter. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,Not much fun,I bought this scooter for my 4year old. It was very clunky and hard to handle. It sat unused for a year. I finally gave it away.
1,"12"" Radio Flyer Classic Red Scooter","This scooter is like a miniature ""Hummer."" And it would be a great toy for my 4-year old son if he was riding through rough terrain or a battlefield. The toy is heavy, clumbsy, and not well not well-built. It was anything but fun and my 4-year old son quickly lost interest in it; I had to purchase another one. (My son was told that Santa made a mistake, and boy did I!) The Radio Flyer company makes great wagons and they, in my opinion, should stick to that market. They've totally missed the scooter market."
3,great if only they make the front wheel base easier to make turns with!,"This scooter has the quality of a radio flyer, well built. However, it isn't very good when maneuvering turns as my 4 1/2 year old gets fustrated when she wants to turn with it. Very limited in the movement."
2,Skip This DVD,This is such a disappointing video. The subject matter should be thrilling yet it is presented in a very matter of fact way with little fanfare.
1,A Top Notch Adventure,"This should be five stars, not one. This is my first C.J. Box book and it certainly won't be my last. It was great to read about a hero who had a normal family life and makes a mistake now and then. Other reviews have given the plot line, so I don't think it's necessary for me to do so. However, I would like to say that the author has created believable characters and situations and kept up the suspense all the way through the novel. I liked reading about a wilderness area that I knew nothing about. Great job!"
3,Great setting,This is the fifth book in the Joe Pickett series.He is an appealing and quite well drawn character. Like the other books this has a lot of concentration on his family life. Unfortunately it has got rather too much like a soap Opera and is repetitive. His wife's character seems to have taken a somewhat implausible turn for the worse.As usual the wildlife and scenery descriptions are quite good and I wish the author concentrated more on them.The storyline starts out quite intriguingly but then gets rather silly and unrealistic.Maybe I am over analysing these books and should consume them quickly and not worry about all the implausibility's and inconsistency. In many respects these books are like undemanding TV shows and should be enjoyed as such.I bought four of these when they were available at a bargain price but I doubt that I will buy any more.
5,An excellent book!,"Box excels at sense of place and creating interesting characters. This book has the classic elements of drama and suspense. But there is much more to it than that. This is a book about conflict on many different levels. It's intriguing, dark, honorable and made me think. It is, I believe, Box's best book so far."
4,Joe Pickett series,"I liked all of the Joe Pickett series which I have read so far, and I have read the first four novels. I have ordered and received four additional volumes, and I'm enjoying the second book received, which is the fourth in the series. My cousin turned me on to this particular author by giving me the first two books in the series, and I pass them along to a friend when I finish reading them and he is also enjoying the series."
5,Out of Range,"C J Box has scored again! Delightfully evil villains. Joe Pickett and his wife Mary Beth are well-developed protagonists. Fans who have read the previous books learn more about the couple's human failings, which make them even more sympathetic and admirable. Joe goes to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as a replacement for a friend/co-worker who mysteriously committed suicide. It's immediately apparent that he's an anomaly among the rich, the arrogant and the avaricious. As usual Joe's reputation arrives before he does. The twists and turns again make this a book that will cost the reader a half night's sleep. At least, I was unable to put it down once I got past chapter 3."
3,Not bad at all,A quick read and keeps ones attention. Interesting characters- though not developed much; and some plot twists to keeps this exciting.
4,Darker,"One ingredient I would add to the mix amid all of these mixed reviews is Darkness. Not the dystopian darkness of Infinite Jest but a more personal, involutional and really quite terrifying darkness (even despite the humor, which in fact grows so delirious as to become terrifying in itself at times). The characters inhabiting Infinite Jest, however narcissistic and self-destructive, are woven into a fabric; the sickness of Infinite Jest is societal. Here it is personal, agonizing, solipsistic. If you were to take away his brilliant language Wallace's vision in Brief Interviews would be unendurable. But then, only by that brilliant tool could the vision have been so vividly shown."
2,Clever but Reader-Friendly?,"As a writer, I found the craft utilized by David Foster Wallace intriguing. He really breaks out of what a standard ""story"" can be and is quite successful in a few of the pieces. I, however, did not enjoy much of what I read.There is something to be said for being clever and being inventive but to put so many stories together in one collection limits the ability to take them all in and truly enjoy them. I think if this book had been cut in half I would have given it a better review, but the sheer number of non traditional stories was too overwhelming. In other words, I wanted more story and less creation."
2,A Failed Experiment,"David Foster Wallace certainly conducts an interesting experiment with this collection of shorts. He has a knack for writing in the present, or capturing a moment that, in many ways, is unprecedented. He portrays the absurdity of contemporary culture in a way that makes the the reader feel close to the oddities and peculiarities. However, Wallace often fails to create characters that are compelling and interesting. When he manages to do so, and he begins gaining momentum, he is often slowed by a less compelling, or tedious short. The stories themselves are often redundant, and what seemed to be a cohesive series of shorts soon becomes a tedious compilation of repetitive stories."
2,Fragments of modernism not as compelling as his essays,"I am a huge fan of DFW's non fiction. His essays are amongst the choicest examples of the modern form. But his fiction I'm not so sure. I keep gearing up for a shot at his mammoth Infinite Jest, but reading these trickles from his stream of consciousness mind puts me off. I can see the talent there, but these come across as flicked off the wrist exercises in craft. Neither particularly stylish nor funny. I think I'll stick to the non fiction."
4,A Different Perspective,"This was the second of David Foster Wallace's books that I've read, after Infinite Jest. This is certainly a more accessible tome in comparison, but maintain's Wallace's unique perspective. Much like the man himself, this book is often very funny, and sometimes very sad, but always comes from a perspective of seeking out the humanity in characters where it's not always obvious.This is obviously a much different book than Infinite Jest, which was a sprawling novel of vast ambition. The short stories, or 'brief interviews,' will sometimes make you laugh out loud, sometimes blow you away, and sometimes leave you scratching your head and shrugging. And in that respect, the two books are very much the same."
3,Not all that I wanted it to be,"I'm a HUGE David Foster Wallace fan, so it is with sadness that I find that I can't give his latest collection of stories a better rating. As much as I hate to say this, I think DFW's style is getting a little stale. The footnotes that were so fresh in Infinite Jest and A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, for instance, are tedious in Brief Interviews With Hideous Men. The characters were too pathetic to care about one way or the other.This said, though, you could do a whole lot worse than to read DFW's worst and the fact that I didn't particularly like this one is not enough turn me off of DFW for good. I'll be waiting with baited breath for his next."
2,"His insight and his writing skill has not diminished, but his subject matter is deprived and you guessed it, hideous","I read a collection of Wallace's essays called ""Consider the Lobster"" that I found provocative and insightful. His descriptions of people and places were saturated with wonderful rich details. Together the effect of Wallace's intellect and his writing skill was simply electric. With regard to Hideous Men, his insight and his writing skill has not diminished, but his subject matter is deprived and you guessed it, hideous. I guess I was ill prepared for how low he could go. A couple of the short stories were searing with surprise twists and turns. The rest were an exercise in self indulgent ranting. Remembering his suicide, I couldn't help but wonder if this was a window to the soul of a man truly unhinged."
2,Wanted: An Editor,"The pattern here soon becomes familiar. Start with an oddball premise, sometimes shocking, sometimes offbeat, occasionally brilliant. Find a voice, an authentic voice -- perhaps working class, maybe self-obsessed neurotic, occasionally just delightfully kooky. Then, with these admirable ingredients, proceed to beat the reader over the head with this same premise, this same voice, for 30, 40, or 50 pages. While slogging through this, occasionally smiling, sometimes laughing, but mostly drowning, I recalled Jack Kerouac's famous line ""you're a genius all the time."" Kerouac wasn't and neither was DFW. But what editor had the balls to tell either of them that?"
2,Where I lost patience,"I loved much of Infinite Jest and his essay collection A Supposedly Fun Thing, but he always had tics which threatened to ruin his work and here they are given free rein. It's all here: the trivializing long-windedness, the meaning-denying vocabulary, the distracting footnotes, the reflexive experimentation, the fetishization of the grotesque, the general sense of droning and contempt for the reader."
1,Disjointed,"This book was a boring read, very disjointed, and not at all what I expected based on the description. Although effective (his piece ""the depressed person"" put me in a depressing, annoyed mood with every page I read), it was not for me."
2,Ick. Not for me.,"Supposed to be great. Critics loved it. So original. I thought it was boring and annoying. A collection of short stories about unlikable people, a lot of gibberish that was intentionally unintelligible. Which is fine for a while, but an entire book is too much. I really disliked it. I applaud any attempt to do something completely different, so I give it two stars instead of one, but jabbing knitting needles into my eye sockets would be different too, and I wouldn't like that much either."
3,Wallace gone Hemmingway?,"First off, allow me to say that I'm a huge fan of Mr. Wallace and have nothing but the utmost respect for his uncommon intelligence. That having been said, I find this collection of stories utterly infuriating. Mr. Wallace, surely you must know by now that your core readers ENJOY keeping the trusty Oxford English dictionary by their sides as they read. So, why must you alienate us? Why keep the sentences so simple? Have you shamelessly let your editors boost your reader appeal at the expense of your style? Unfortunately, as I whipped through this collection, I found I had more questions (pertaining to your personal motives as opposed to those raised by the literature) than answers. Granted, it's still better than 99% of the rest of the printed manure out there, but this is definitely a low point in the Wallace catalog. Here's to hoping for a triumphant return."
4,Three quarters amazingly entertaining,"Most of these vignettes were just preciously hilarious - piercing but entertaining views of the human condition.I found a few of them a little tedious: they were like Dennis Miller meets Faulkner. But maybe I'm just not patient enough.Also, if you're a man-hater, this is a must have for your collection! ;)"
4,Falsely billed as a comedy,"Excerpts of reviews printed on the cover bill the book as a brilliant comedy. Brilliant, perhaps; comedic, no. Violence, rape, and misogyny are the common themes of these stories. One graphic description of a rape disturbed me for days. The book is full of creativity and worth reading, but don't expect lighthearted humor."
3,More effin' footnotes?,"Wake up, people! It's a gimmick. A literary gimmick that gets older and more hackneyed-looking with each passing second. Footnotes. Hah!"
1,Smug and Vile,"I have to preface this review by saying that I normally do not have a visceral reaction to novels and stories I do not like. As a matter of fact, I have wasted a good chunk of my life reading things that were no good and or not worth reading. That being said, I actually threw this book across the room. I have never read such a self-congratulatory piece in all my life. The smug conceit of the author actually oozes out of every page. The book made me go and reread some Dostoevsky, just so I could feel better about the world and literature."
1,Brief Review of Hideous Book,"Having read -- and disliked -- two of this collection's pieces in Esquire and The New Yorker, I should have avoided ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men."" But I wanted to give David Foster Wallace and his vaunted dry humor one more chance. I found a couple of the briefest stories (""Forever Overhead,"" the first episode of the two-part ""The Devil is a Busy Man"") interesting and even laugh-provoking, but the remaining stories bored me. Like Jon Stewart's ""Naked Pictures of Famous People,"" this book strives too hard and self-consciously to be funny. Wallace should buy a volume or two of Barry Hannah's work and study the master of the dryly hilarious short story."
2,someone wake me and 'splain me.,"I'm not a literary genius as clearly some of the author's fans are but, I'm bright enough to know this was really self indulgent and asked a whole lot of the reader without giving much back. I did enjoy some of the interviews that revealed the ""hideous men"" (and a few women as well). And, I found some of what seemed to be total stream of consciousness to be interesting for a bit. But, the gibberish went on forever, the pages and pages of footnotes were annoying, not funny, and the fact that DW felt absolutely no obligation to gift the readers with any kind of resolve to any of it, ever, is a statement in and of itself. If you put 100 avid readers in a room with this book you would have 18 people smiling with their face buried in the pages, 10 people sound asleep, and 72 others intermittently looking around to see if anyone else was as bewildered and bored as they are. Abstract and uppity isn't necessarily genius."
5,The Future of Fiction,"I can only echo jonvoellestad's excellent review below. This is truly a book for our times, and Wallace is the one contemporary writer who seems to hit the mark with everything he does. He is able to track and elucidate moments in life which we all have but which we've never seen in fiction before.There are many great stories and vignettes here but the highlight is the outstanding penultimate story (simply called Brief Interviews #20) in which a man narrates his experience of a girl telling the story of how she was raped by a psychotic sex killer. The trick is that Wallace manages to write highly self-consciously, humorously and movingly all at the same time, no easy feat. He takes the best parts of the realist, modernist and postmodernist traditions and combines them into something new and hilariously funny.In doing so he transcends genre to produce something new and very exciting. The future of fiction is here."
3,He's a genius. He writes books. Mutually exclusive.,What if Bill Gates wrote novels instead of what he does? Would they be D.F. Wallace books? I find DFW's books fascinating but as warm as ice. I will continue to buy them the moment they appear.
4,Kindle for Thinking,Liked this one a lot. I listened to the interviews on Audio C.D. and enjoyed the times with these hideous men. Its not an easy fun book. It is true kindle for thinking.
1,King of Blarney,"More blarney from the king of blarney. How does this crap get published? Wait, don't answer. The editors in NY are more puerile than the child who penned this egotistical, mastabatory gibberish. The writing here reminds me of precious artsy undergradute literary magazine twaddle."
2,Lengthy Soliloquies on Boring Themes,"A collection of stories has more latitude in shorting plot and characterization than a novel does, but this collection's stories goes way overboard in exiguity. All but one of the pieces -- or perhaps two -- seem a farrago of odd, un-reviewed essays and are too often encumbered by poorly edited, impertinent footnotes.I liked one of the stories -- about a sexual predator with a birth defect. His character was well-defined, and the story had punch -- it was a full 360 degree view of the practice of a particular perversity.The other stories -- e.g., the boy at the pool, the toilet minder, the girl who was violated -- I found flabby and pointless artistically. I found particularly silly the story of the toilet minder, a story I would have to characterize as a sad pushcart of childish scatology."
5,Outstanding Value on an Excellent Collection,"Great set at an excellent value. There is not a bad movie in the bunch and there are several excellent movies. This is certainly a cost effective way to get the best of Oliver Stone's work. Any three of these movies are worth the price of the set. Unfortunately I already owned Natural Born Killers, but fortunately Platoon was not in this set as I already owned it as well. While all of these movies are at least 4 stars in my opinion, several are five star movies including Natural Born Killers, Wall Street, U Turn, JFK, and Any Given Sunday.I highly recommend this set for anyone that likes good movies."
2,"Great zoom range, auto focus not so good","I got mine off Ebay, Like the maximum 2.8 aperture and zoom range but not too happy with the auto focus. Has a lot of trouble focusing on with anything but bright subject. Often hunts but fails to find focus. Not sure if it is a problem with mine or the model lens."
2,Ya! Rust spots when put in dishwasher.,"I bought this to replace wooden handle Chicago Cutlery knives that were being ruined in the dishwasher. These don't have the quality metal that the old wooden handle Chicago Cutlery knives do since the wooden ones don't develop rust spots on the metal after a run through the dishwasher while these do. So they must be of poorer quality than the old ones I have had for years. I also bought the Wusthof Grand Prix set and there are much much better for just $20 more. I know, I know you're not supposed to put knives in the dishwasher but I need to kill the harmful bacteria and heat sterilize them after cutting raw chicken etc. don't I?"
3,"Ok, for the price!","Face it, if you want real quality you'd have bought the Heienkels set! But it's better than Farberware. This set does hold an edge, but tends to not hold it very long. On a price to quality ratio, I'd say it's above average, and acceptable for daily home use."
1,Disappointed Twice Over,"I purchased this Insignia set. Three weeks later the handles cracked. I decided it must have been a fluke and tried a second Insignia set. I washed the knives in the dishwasher prior to the initial use. Two of the handles cracked and on 6 of the knives the stamp ""Chicago Cutlery"" washed off, perhaps they weren't proud of their product. It does say in two places on the box that they are dishwasher safe. I did like how the knives cut and especially how they were weighted. I will not however purchase a third set of these knives, the quality seems to be lacking."
1,Made in China,"The set of ""Chacago Cutlery"" knifes has MADE IN CHINA written all over it: on box, on every knife"
4,Great for the average cook,"I consider myself a savvy shopper and usually do my homework before making a purchase. This includes reading any reviews I can find. I read the ones posted here and I must admit I stewed over making this purchase for about a week and finally came to the conclusion that what was considered a ""higher quality"" or more expensive set of knives such as Henkel or Wustoff wasn't needed in our household. We are the average busy family with no more than 3 or 4 meals a week cooked here. Thus, eliminating the need to spend more money. I have always considered Chicago Cutlery to be quality in my book, and I am very pleased with my purchase. I also want to note that I didn't have the problem with the cracked handles as some reviewers had stated. They were just fine, and I love being able to throw them in the dishwasher!"
4,Good Knives at a Fair Price,"These knives are a value for the price. They are well balanced and have a nice grip, and provide a fair quality at a fair price. I also like the bakelite handles that are dishwasher safe."
2,Problems with small knives,"I think the knives are great, except that many of the small knife handles are cracked. I don't know if it would cause a problem, but I don't like to buy new things that appear broken. I e-mailed Chicago Cutlery customer service and after three messages and waiting over a week they suggested I call a number they gave me. Well it was too late, the knives had already been packed up and returned. I also noticed the same problem on the same small knives for sale in one of their factory stores."
3,"Great knife, but quality it ain't","I made the mistake of purchasing this knife set before I read the reviews listed here. Like several others, three of my knives had cracks in them near the rivets. In addition, there were obvious quality concerns in the construction of the knives. That's why I packed up these knives and sent them back to where I purchased them. In spite of obvious flaws, they are good knives and extremely well balanced, although I would have preferred a more ergonomic handle (it's kind of thin). In fact, I saw a Chicago Cutlery Centurion three knife gift set (same knives, different name) at [a local store] for [a low cost], so I purchased it. These knives had no cracks and clearly had higher quality construction. I guess they save the lower quality knives for their sets."
3,"beautiful knife block set, cracked handles","I always considered Chicago Cutlery as a high quality manufacturer. I thought this particular set was very attractive. The knives offer a nice balanced feel with a thick bolster and full tang. However, 5 of the 7 knives had a very obvious split/crack in the handles.I noticed someone else had this same complaint in the reviews but I still opted to buy the set. I was dismayed to discover the same defect. The defect may not take away from the functionality, but it certainly takes away from its appearance!!"
4,"Good suspense, good choice for obsessed lover genre fans","This movie has great blues music, two beautiful women in love with the same guy. Only problem, one of them is mentally unstable to the max! Nice update on the FATAL ATTRACTION type picture."
1,"Kind of a sad,dissturbing ending.","I Think the ending of this movie would have been better if she would of gotten arrested,Instead. Not only that they had to bring up a sad scene from her childhood."
5,AWESOME,"I have been a fan of Anas, Anna, Rosie and Faye for 2 years now. This DVD is awesome, even thou there's only 2 music videos on here it's so worth buying. Whole Again takes you back to the 1950's with co0l makeup and clothes while I Must Not Chase the Boys shows a more mature side of them. A MUST for any Play fan!-Lisa"
4,a fine balance,This great magazine blends articles about antiques and fine art and craft in a way that is accessable to collector and novice alike.The layout is clean and well designed with insightfull but not stuffy text.
4,One Of The Best So Far!!!!,After reading the 13th Heartland book I'm glad things are starting to get back to normal. I found alot of surprises in this book too though! Like the fact that Soraya doesn't like Ben anymore and how Amy meets Ty's old girlfriend Kerry-Anne. I can't wait to find out what happens in the 15th Heartland book Love Is A Gift!!!p.s. for all of you who love those kissing parts and seens when Amy and Ty are alone I do too!
5,Awesome Book!!!!!!!,"Ok,this was a great book!I was so mad when #13 left you hanging about Ty!I'm overjoyed that he is recovering.I hope there are more Heartlands.About Soraya,I think it was sort of mean and betraying that she quit the thing w/ Ben,but it still is an awesome book!I love Dazzle,the mustang,because of his personality,breed,color,etc.THIS BOOK IS GREAT!"
4,Awesome book!,"Beautiful! A heart warming book, a gallant attempt that really showed. Nicely written. A little secret to those who read the book- Amy gets to meet a beautiful mustang stallion, Dazzle. As far as secrets go, I am telling no more. Fab book!!"
5,Sooooooo Amazing,soory for my terrible english i am a german heartland fan the book trou enough is in germany coming .Its terrible the books need to much time to translate .but i can say the books are so amazing i read it in 3 hours .i love horses and i love this book seriesi can just say READ IT !!!!!.
5,Great product,"For the price this lens gets the job done. Stopped down to f/7.1 - f10 gives amazing sharpness. As far as I can see there are no chromatic abberations. Focusing is very quick compared to the Tamron 70-300. The Focusing motor is a little noisy. I'm using this lens on the K-r. Because the K-r has a high ISO range, in low light I shoot at ISO 5000 with good quality and no problem. High ISO ranges eliminates the need the for the very expensive f/2.8 lens hype. I'm a wedding photographer and my lenses put in alot of work so I'll update my review soon."
5,The Eraser - Special Edition,"This Special Edition of The Eraser includes the album, a single and a t-shirt all packed in a firm plastic bag with handles.I for myself love The Eraser as an album and found this edition quite cheap for it's content. The t-shirt is supposed to be a size Large, but it's more like a Medium."
1,LIES,"This item dont have a OBI, only a tshirt and two cds, but dont are from tailandia o malasya... is a lie, sorry for my english"
3,Liked Rewriting the Wrongs best so far....,"I have been a fan since the days of the Bachelors, but somehow it always fell short for me. I was introduced to The Dear john Letters by my Gal. I fell in love with Rewriting the Wrongs. (still in my top ten of all time favorite local records.) All I can say about Stories is that I miss the writing team of Rob Benson and poet/lyricist Michelle PriceI noticed he used another name on this record in the writing credits, I thought maybe it was a pseudonym for Benson? (It had the same nonsensical lyricism as Benson is known for) Aside from the repeat of the beautiful co-written songs of Unbroken, this could have very well been a Nevada Bachelor's record. Good but not steller. I for one am hoping to hear more from the Benson-Price team and DJL in the future!!"
2,Great performance - unfortunate audio quality,"This disk sounds like it was recorded in my bedroom closet. I may be hypersensitive to such characteristics, but when I want to listen to music of this type I expect it to sound alive and bright -- not tired and hollow. Certainly the price is an impetus for impulse purchase... but you might want to pay more for, say, the recording of Telemann's ""Water Music"" done by Musica Antiqua Koln."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of medical thrillers and I was so disappointed with this one. This book was 346 pages long and really, it could have been half, if not a quarter of that. The story behind it is good...seemingly healthy patients are dying from a pulmonary embolus even though they had a special medical device inserted into them. Sounds like a good story but oddly the author doesn't even go into any detail about it. It's more of Whodunnit with a bunch of bumbling cops. Two thumbs down."
4,Great Medical Thriller,"The third book by this author, and this one is the best! It is captivating and suspenseful. I did not put it down until I had finished it! Very authentic in the presentation of medical material which adds to the thrill and excitement of the book."
5,"Exploring, Discovering and Learning With Children","There are several nice things about this book. The activities are fun and use regular household items that most people have on hand. The items needed for each activity are listed in a section called ""Just take..."". The authors share personal experiences from their own childrearing and quotations which apply to child development. There is a space on each page to write personal reflections, ideas, or comments about how the activity went when you tried it. The authors comment that they are not famous or well-respected scholars. Actually, they have made a real contribution by taking the time to gather these ideas and put them into a fun-to-use format. Fun for children of ALL ages."
5,Sensual Magic!,"Tides of Love is a must-read for any romance reader who loves strong heroines and unforgettable heros. Noah and Elle are all that and more. Plus, I liked the setting very much. I have never been to the Outer Banks of North Carolina (and certainly not in 1898!!!) but really wish to go now. I also like the hotter edge in this book. Some of the best love scenes I've read in a long time. (I am a loyal Susan Johnson and Thea Devine reader.) It is also sweet and very romantic. Ms. Sumner delves deeper into the character's than is the norm too."

3,OTC 1130,"This tool came with alot of the casting material still present. If you were to use it strait out of the box the bolts would warp because of it. I spent a good hour with a heavy file to remove the casting so the nuts would rest flush on the splitter. while removing a pinion bearing on a 9"" the inner eye area became distorted while removing the bearing on the press. The tool say's right on it,"" Made from global outsourced materials"" That might mean China.But for the money this tool is hard to beat if you plan on only using it on a few occasions,but if you are a proffesional, look else where."
1,"What a disaster, don't buy this machine","Save your money and buy another brand. I went through 3 of these machines in 2 months. Each one worked worse than the previous. Messy, the ""steam cleaning"" feature is a joke, grounds are still left all over the place and you have to wipe the whole inside top and grinding chamber to clean up the beans. Each machine also became so slow in making coffee that half the water drifted away as steam. It's ashame Krups let the quality slip so much, it appears that many others have the same issues. I just ordered the Melitta gind-n-brew, I hope it works better."
1,the other guys aren't kidding!,"My first clue was the discovery of coffee residue on the machine the first time I used it--had already been returned to the store once! I could overlook the turbine-engine grinder noise if it worked more than 15% of the time, but a successful pot usually involves completely disassembling the machine's many parts, declogging, drying, waiting 30 minutes for the cycle...then it gets its one star for tasty coffee. Still, after several months, I'm giving up. I wonder if the positive reviewers have used theirs for over 2 days."
1,"Loud, louder, then failure","Liked it the first month, even though it woke us every morning and it was very quirky - - often the beans wouldn't grind unless we'd wiped out the machine. But then it simply failed to pull the water through, and got louder and louder like a kid blowing on a straw. Returned it, and afraid to buy any other Krups."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!!,"This is a terrible coffee maker - the worst I've had. We put 10 cups of water in it, and an HOUR later we have about 3 cups of coffee. It works very well as a humidifier since that's where most of the water seems to go - into the air as steam. If we put a dish rag over the steam vents on top, we do a little better - about 5 cups in an hour (after putting in 10cups of water). We clean the constantly-clogging grinder every day, but still do not get any better performance. Also, the design of the carafe is terrible - you cannot pour from it without burning your hands from escaping steam. Overall, it's a total waste. We've only had it for 3 months, and we're shopping for a new one (NOT KRUPS!)."
4,Good coffee maker with few problems.,"I have yet to own a coffee maker as good as this one. I would have given it 5 stars, but because it got clogged up on me and wouldn't make coffee shortly after I bought it, I decided to give it only 4 stars. However, once I got it unclogged, it's worked excellent ever since. The grinder is noisy, like everyone has already said, but come on. Isn't a grinder supposed to be noisy? I guess for those who don't like noisy grinders shouldn't have a Grind-N-Brew coffee maker then."
1,Great considering it's the first coffee maker ever made.,My second fresh aroma in six months just quit. It seems there is a seal inside that can go bad. You will know this when your machine starts to create a lot of steam and seems to make a lot less coffee that water inserted. The grinder sounds like a chain saw. A full pot of coffee takes almost 25 minutes. Krups replaced my first one in two weeks. They promised to refund the $15 postage it took to send it but didn't. This one their sending for and replacing with a different model. I wanted a refund but no go. This is with out a doubt a bad product.
1,WOW! I see I'm not the only one...,"I will add my BAD review to the list .... I feel really bad that my husband spent (dollar amoount) hard-earned dollars last Christmas on this ridiculous machine. After reading the reviews, I've decided to purchase a Melitta Mill & Brew.Everything you've read in these reviews is true. I thoguht at first that I was doing something wrong, but I see I'm not alone with the problems this machine has. Listen to the reviews - DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER!!"
2,Disappointing,"I thought I was going to write an expose here, ripping the lid off this Krups failure -- if only I'd come to this site before I got this fool machine! I think it makes coffee that tastes good, and I was sure sick of the mess from using a separate grinder. But I quickly discovered that if you omit a single step in the set-up, you wind up with a pot full of dirty water and a hopper full of steamed beans. (This can happen even if you do things right. And since the hopper doesn't detach, it can be real tricky getting those wet beans out.) The first time I used it I set it up to have coffee ready when we got up. Darn thing went off like a jet engine and scared me silly. It's more complicated than a VCR and louder than a boombox. The reviewers are right: Bad engineering."
1,Do not waste you money on it,"This is one of the most idiotically designed machine you will ever see. First it is way too loud (you may want to use it as an alarm clock, for self and neighbors), the grind cycle is 50 seconds no matter how much coffee beans you put in it. It makes more steam than coffee, you may have to put 4 cups of water to get one out (magic!!). Grind filter is hidden and is pain to remove and place it back in. The carafe's bottom is narrow and therefore surface on the hot plate is relatively small, so coffee cools real quick. The engineers who designed it must be on dope or something."
2,Changed My Mind About This One,"Previously, I posted a highly enthusiastic, 5-star rating for this machine. Fairly soon thereafter, my coffee grinder/maker began to misbehave in most of the ways described in the poor reviews posted here. At one point, obtaining a new one meant three exchanges at the department store as, in one machine after another, the clock/timer feature didn't work.Ultimately, standing in my kitchen filled with the smell of burning metal, smoke and steamed coffee beans, I'd say ""nice try"" to Krups, but it's too unreliable and quirky to be a worthwhile purchase.Heard this as well from a coworker, to whom I had raved about the machine. Now SHE hates it.SKIP IT.pee ess followed the instructions to a T"
1,Poor Performance from Krups,"Our Krups 625-70 coffee maker never made a decent cup of coffee. It either would not grind beans, or would grind them immediately upon setting it to brew at wake-up. If grounds were used, it took 1 1/2 hours to brew a pot of coffee with water everywhere. Obviously, this machine was never tested and was no good. Unfortunately, we live some distance from a service center, so the [money] we spent on it is wasted. Now we use a $20 machine from Black and Decker that we got at Wal-Mart and have learned our lesson."
2,Great coffee...doesn't last long,"This coffee maker was given to me as a gift, and worked great for about 6 months. It is a VERY high maintenance machine. The entire inside must be wiped down after every brew. It made a great cup of coffee for a while, but now is broken. I cleaned it every day and was very careful, but it leaks water and steam, the screen for grinding broke and now it won't even brew a cup. I called the company and they want me to send it in and I will now be without a coffeemaker for 60 days. DON'T BUY IT!"

1,Terrible!,"I've had this product for about 1.5 years now. Initially, I didn't care for it because it didn't seem to be made well. The worst feature was trying to pour from the decanter without spilling - nearly impossible! In addition, it was difficult to clean due to all the odd shapes and many parts.Right after the one year warranty expired, it developed a leak. Now, the grinder doesn't work at all.This is easily the worst coffee maker I've ever owned. You would be better off spending [less] for a Mr. Coffee than buying this. .."
1,Oh What a Mess Every Morning,"For my birthday I was given a Krups coffee makerwith grinder. Well that was in July and at thispoint I am ready to throw it in the garage.The beans will not go thru the grinder at all.So I tried just using ground coffee. Well Iguess not. The filter that was shipped alongwith the coffee pot with the incorrect size.After trying the new replacement. That becameeven more of a problem. This filter did notfit properly either. So lets say the grinder,filter and maker all our defected items aboutthe only thing that works are the carbon cleaners.To bad the first couple of cups of the coffee werevery tasty."
2,"GOOD COFFEE, BAD COFFEE MAKER","I have had this Krups coffee maker since December 2000.Net:The coffee made is good, but*Grinding motor is way too loud;*Grinding mechanism CAN NEVER BE CLEANED. It is enclosed, and the so called ""self-cleaning"" is not good, so there are always OLD, CRUSTY grinds inside the grinder housing. You can easily test this out by brewing a pot without any beans and seeing how the carafe water is a light tan everytime;*Old hidden grinds, as they dry and ""crustify,"" do eventally slowly fall out of the grinder housing. If your filter basket and pot are not in place (such as if they are removed for cleaning), the grinds will fall out onto the hotplate and get in the seam around the hotplate making it impossible to thoroughly clean.*Brewing is SLOW. For a full pot, don't be surprised if the brewing takes 20 minutes.I've also heard the Cuisinart model is a pain and unreliable. If I were to do it again I'd try the Melitta Grinder/Brewer. That seems to get pretty good reviews."
1,Mine died too fast!,"I bought this coffee maker about a year ago, and paid about [$$$] for it. It has been nothing but problems and is now ready for the grave (I assume this is why Krups stopped making it, and you can not get parts).It made great coffee, but died too soon!"
2,Takes 45 minutes to brew coffee,"Love the look, the grinder, and the taste! It just takes 45 minutes to brew the coffee whether from beans or ground coffee!"
1,"What a Horrible, Horrible Coffee Pot...","Even though previous reviewers capture many of my sentiments, I do have input from Krups themselves to add. I spoke to them last week about the fact that the coffee grinder is jammed, you can't get at it to clear it out, it takes 25 minutes to brew a pot of coffee, and yada, yada, yada. I was hoping they had already decided to recall the darn thing and I would get a newer model that doesn't have all the problems.I was told that it does indeed take 25 minutes to brew coffee and that the grinder getting stuck is probably my own fault if I keep my beans in the freezer. I said it requires too much attention to work properly, and they countered that a Jaguar requires a lot of attention too. Believe me, this is no Jaguar. Like another reviewer, I currently use it to just brew, not grind, and am in the market for a new machine. Thinking about the Capresso."
1,Bad design waste of money,"I bought this coffee maker on April 2001. After few weeks of use it took almost an hour to make 5 cups of coffee. Not to mention all the noise and steam it makes. After 2 months it stopped making coffee. We returned the coffee make to Krups, which replaced it with a new machine. Second coffee maker lasted less than 2 months. It is a very poor design. Krups should RECALL this coffee maker. DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."
1,Note the trend here -- avoid this coffee maker,"I'm always on the lookout for a better coffee maker so I've had lots of experience with good and bad brewers. This was the biggest disappointment by far. If you read the rest of the reviews, you'll see some common threads: 1) Starts out great; 2) After 2 weeks or so, brewing a pot of coffee takes over an hour; 3) Shortly afterward, it just stops working. All that was true for me. There are a variety of design flaws (height of the machine, coffee burns almost immediately on the stay-warm plate) but they pale in comparison to the unbelievably bad engineering.Krups was a favorite brand of mine, but I think the quality of their products has declined dramatically. I'm moving on to Braun, Cuisinart or maybe even Starbucks."
1,A bean to grind with Krups,"More concerned with gadgetry than functinality, the Krups people have designed an applience with all the customer convenience of a NASA rocket launch. By the time you are done preparing this baby for coffee making you actually require something considerably stronger than coffee. Incidentally, a rocket launch is good description of the noise this thing makes during the grind and brew cycle. Easy to damage and impossible to get parts for, it is a great deal like owning a Lamborghini. All the Chevy owners will smile knowingly as they pass you by alongside the road."
1,A very unreliable coffee maker,"A plastic part broke after three months. It took two months to get a replacement because they were out of stock. (Probably because it breaks so frequently.) After less than a year, the grinder runs whenever the unit is plugged in, even with the lid open, the dial set to ""off"", and the selector set to ""no grind"". That's a very dangerous defect. I'm never going to buy a Krups again."
1,worst,This is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned. I have had better luck with the ... pots you buy at discount stores.
1,disapointing product,"We liked our Krups grind and brew so well we bought one for my inlaws. We liked them until we used it awhile. The one for the inlaws leaked right out of the box. Ours worked for a little while then it too leaked, turned on by itself, and began to melt away the arm that held up the lid.I called Krups and e-mailed them all they said was the standard phrase. If you think there is a problem send it in to one of our repair centers.I used to believe krups was one of the best in the buisness, not anymore. Everyone can have problems, but its the way you handle them that counts. I tried to get them to recall this product the 625. The two machines were bought from totally different locations and had the same problems. buyer beware!"
1,not well designed,"I had this machine for 8 months. In that time it was replaced once. This is one of the most poorley designed coffee machines. Whenever you grind beans, they escape and go into the water resevoir. The coffee grinds get stuck in the water intake and then you are out of luck. Also, the coffe is not hot at all. You have to leave it on the burner for 30 min before it gets hot.Take my advice. Get a decent coffee grinder and a good machine. I'm pretty sure Krups discontinued this machine and will no longer make it. I wonder why."
1,Krups Aroma-Great coffee for two weeks,"Purchased this model and used it for two weeks before it started to produce steam and not coffee and then clock stopped. The brew time went form 5 minutes to 30 minutes. When it worked, it made the best coffee I have ver tasted. Called the local repair station who told me that they do not have any parts, so I sent it to Krups. After one month I am still waiting for my unit back. Krups is a great company, but this product need a major redesign. I just purchased the Melitta grind and brew which is a very well designed product."
2,Krups Coffee Maker,"The Krups 625-70 coffee maker is cheaply made with a lot of plastic and plastic hinges. The instructions make no sense and have you making coffee BEFORE they tell you to remove the water filter for a clean-out run thru. Once I finally figured it out and went out to buy filters, the coffee was O.K., about what you'd get from a Mr. Coffee. For this price you'd think they could write a decent manual AND throw in some filters."
2,So So,"Makes good coffee but the steam rinse system does not prevent clogging of the grinder. You have to clean it virtually every time. In fact Krups includes two notices reminding you to do so. Also, the coffee pot steams your hand as you pour the coffee. Bottom line: Neat design but doesn't work so well"
1,"POOR, POOR SORRY I BOUGHT IT","Customer support at Krups, super poor. Coffee maker super super SLOW in making lukewarm but ok tasting coffee, pot very hard to handle, filling coffee making area with water from pot is impossible, as water spills all over, grinder built in feature SUPER LOUD, clogs alot, very poor, worst money I ever spent, do not buy, very very bad product. Would love a QUICK, HOT cup of java, not much to ask after spending 100.00, is it!"
1,Grinder doesn't shine,"I purchased the grinder/coffee maker in Feb, 2002 and the grinder slings ground coffee back up into the bean chamber and into the water chamber. Thinking it was a design flaw I contacted Krups to suggest a removable screen be installed over the beans to prevent this. After a period of time with no response I contacted Krups and was told to return the product. Krups has had the product for 2 weeks and no word for repair or replacement. I could have bought a functional, dependable coffee maker for the cost of return shipping for this Krups and bought a separate grinder at very little cost. I gave this product 1 star but the shine of that 1 is getting very dim."
1,Complicated and Unreliable,"We've had 2 versions of this coffeemaker go bad in less than a year! We sent one back since it stopped perking in less than 2 months and we are getting ready to send the next one back since the heating unit went out in less than 5 months. When you clean and dry the machine, which is required after EVERY use, you have to be able to insert the strainer back into the machine without looking--something my husband was never able to do--thus, when I was gone, he used the cheap, spare coffeemaker which just keeps perking on! ..."
1,Buy another brand,"I would give this product -5 stars if I could. I received this as a gift. It never worked. The gravity feed for the grinder constantly got stuck. It was able to make coffee about 1 out of every 3 attempts. You could agitate the machine to assist the beans in their path downward, but then why have a timer?In addition to not being able to make coffee (its primary task in life), the thing demands a lot of counter space. The basket swings to the left, requiring free space to the left. If you're right-handed, you need free space to the right of the machine. This unique design ""feature"" effectively triples the width.Personally, I'm never buying another product from Krups as long as I live."
4,Krups automatic griner/coffee maker,"I liked it so much I'm getting one of each of my two sons, and my brother!"
1,This one's a lemon!,"My Krups Grind and Brew never worked right from day one. At first I thought it was my water, because I kept having to change the filters, but that was not the case. It steams continually and takes a very long time to brew the coffee. It is very difficult to get consistent flavor. I have owned it for less than a year, and interior plastic parts under the cover are breaking. (I am very gentle with my appliances.) This product is a true lemon! Do yourself a favor and pass it over!"
2,too much work for a cup of coffee.,"I just got my krups coffee maker and I m very dissapointed.I had a grind and brew coffee maker which was great( Another kind) This machine requiresyou dry the bean hopper before eachuse. It also requires you to dry the lid thoughly, and dry andclean the ground catcher. The other thing( which is the worst thing about this machine is the noise and the lengh of which it makes this ear pierecing sound. Even when all the beans are ground it goese on for 50 seconds each time. The design of this machine is one of the worst I have ever seen. Make sure you have a good 15 minutes each time you want coffee. The onlything redeemable about this machine is it makes decent coffee.I was very dissapointed. I'm glad to hear they have discontinuedthis model."
2,Disappointment,Grinding motor broke within 2 months. Nearest service provider is an hour away. Have not had time to call Krups directly so now I grind the beans before setting up the coffeemaker. Kinda misses the mark.
3,Good coffee but a pain to keep clean!,"Just received this unit a couple of weeks ago since it was on clearance...I must say, it does make a delicious cup of java but the subtrefuge required for maintaining this coffee maker is nothing short of ridiculous. I find that it is much less work to just use ground coffee rather than to grind my own beans in the morning (the grinder is VERY loud). When I have used the grinder, it grinds rather unevenly and requires too much cleaning from use-to-use to make it very efficient. The brewing time is also very slow compared to what I am used to, though I do like the ability to pour a cup while the pot is still brewing. On the upside, the timer works and the design is sleek, but if you are considering a premium brand of coffee maker, I would have to say skip this unit and go for something simpler!"
2,Shot after a year and a half,"When I first used this Coffee Maker I fell in love, It worked great and made one heck of a cup of coffee....As much care as I showed this thing I thought it would last forever. That was however not the case, ..."
2,boy was i wrong!,i take back what i said about this . coffee/grinder if thats what you want to call it. makes great coffee. but i can't see the time on the clock due to condensation and the grinder has a mind of its own goes off whenever it wants to finally had to unplug coffee maker. have tried getting in touch with krups no answer. fortunately i received this as a gift so im not out any money. too bad for krups i'm sure thay make great products just not coffee makers.
1,What a pain!!,This coffee maker does make wonderful coffee - but it is such a pain to clean. I think the worst part is waiting more than a half an hour for your coffee to even brew! I've had it for three months and it still works good but am currently in the market for an new one!
1,This is the WORST,"We went from a clogged Capresso to this Krups - what a mistake. I could never get it to grind all of the beans - then when it doesn't, they all get soaked and you have to take them all out and clean the whole grinding mechanism before you make another pot. It is difficult to clean and VERY noisy. We kept it less than a week and sent it back - I will get another Capresso. I noticed the price of the Krups has dropped... in the past month - it still isn't worth it."
1,EGAD!!!,"Looked great, priced right, features sounded good. First & foremost, it was loud. My vaccuum is quieter. Setting that aside, after one short month of use it broke. It would create only steam and after taking 20 minutes to empty the tank of water, I had about 1/2 a pot of something that was not coffee. The mandatory drying of the bean chamber was a hassle, as was all the cleaning and removal of parts it required to make a new pot. Extremely disappointing!"
3,does whats its supposed to do. requires effort,"I purchased this because of the Grind and Brew option. It does as promised and works good. Makes a good cup of coffee. Its just that the feel of the thing is not tight, lots of parts hard to shut and close properly. In other words it requires effort, ie cleaning and drying the grinder each time you use it. It also seems to take forever for the brewing process to complete 20 mins for a few cups of coffee."
1,"So Slow and Loud,Great Coffee",Takes a 1/2 hr to brew 6 cups. So you set the timer early and wake up the hole house with the VERY LOUD grinder. I was hoping to wake to the smell of fresh brew. Krups Consumer Information says to send it back and within 4 weeks they will repair it. SORRY Naomi good tasting coffee that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
1,1 Star because there is no 1/2 star.,"This makes GREAT tasting coffee... but...The coffee beans get stuck and don't grind unless it is perfectly dry where you put the beans in. This also where the water goes in!There is a strainer that is broken since we got it. It's always falling down.It's always a mess, coffee grounds go everywhere.It only makes 10 cups.It's difficult to pour the water in because of the shape of the carafe and the lip (which hits the carafe as you pour in the water)."
1,Good coffee? I don't think so...,"As one who enjoys fresh coffee from freshly ground beans I thought I had found just the combination in this machine. I was sorely mistaken. As others have stated in their reviews, the machine is terribly noisy, beans do not feed through the chute on their own accord, and it takes forever and a day to get a pot of coffee. You also need to drink quickly before the machine automatically shuts the warming plate off.I took the time to write Krups about this product, and was basically blown off. Their only suggestion was to send it in for repair, a process that would take 4-6 weeks. In corresponding with them I also found it took a full 10 days both times I wrote to receive a respone via email.There is no way I would recommend this machine to anyone who truly enjoys good coffee, or even bad coffee."
3,Too Much Of Anything is Too Much,"Chicago is a great band. Terry Kath, Danny Seraphine, Robert Lamm, and Peter Cetera. When you do the math who is left? Robert Lamm. Lamm has decided to become Chicago. The first three discs are excellent. The rest of the box set is pure boredom. All of the 80's and 90's Dianne Warren written formulaic shmaltzy power ballads. This box was not needed. Now we have a new lineup now including Bill Champlin (keyboards, vocals), Jason Scheff (bass, vocals), Keith Howland (guitar), and Tris Imboden (drums), along with founding members Lamm, Parazaider, Loughnane, and Pankow. . The first 3 discs are excellent. If you want a career retrospective all you need is ""The Very Best of Chicago: Only the Beginning"" or even better ""Chicago Transit Authority"" CTA is musical window to what could have been."
4,Those medleys...,It could have been perfect if Make Me Smile was not in the medley. The rest made me smile after all.
5,Chicago is right uptown!,"This box set covers their body of work completely. My wife has been a fan for 40 years. We have seen them live three times over the decades. They never disappoint. In fact once at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, VA my daughter had the chance to chat with Jason. We walked up beside their limo after the show; he rolled down the window and was so kind to my teen-aged daughter. He signed a personalized autographed and actually chatted with her and her friend. A lifetime memory. This box set captures their vast talent. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
5,What can I say....it's CHICAGO!,"This set, to me, is one of their best. I already have many of these recordings, however, it's great having them in one set. The DVD is funny and entertaining."
3,Product works boxing poor,Cd set was not damaged but the collector case was torn up and broken. Very upset that they would sell something with poor presentation and damaged product. However the actual product works and wasn't compromised so that's a good thing.
5,I couldn't put it down!!,"From start to finish this book had me turning the pages. Colleen and Terence's story touched me because I too am a newleywed. I was riveted with the love triangle aspect. Overall, a good read."
3,Moducare,I have been using the product for a condition I have with the immune system for 8 months. It seems to work awhile then doesn't. I have had to increase the dosage twice. So I don't know if it will really work
1,sought relief from sjogren's symptoms,"I have a lot of inflammation and fatigue due to Sjogren's Syndrome. I had hoped that Moducare would give me some relief from achiness, low-grade fever, low energy, etc. For two months I took 1 pill three times a day. Then I doubled the dosage to two pills three times a day. However, after three months I concluded that I was wasting my money. Bummer, as I had high expectations that I would feel at least somewhat better."
3,Check car first,"Didn't fit our car... I had to research beyond amazon to find fit list, the Mazda 5 will not fit any of there products."
3,Does its job,Have to make adjustments for bikes to ride it. Gets very tight and sometimes hard to put four bikes on it. I also bought extension rods for women's bike. Tape all anchors or your car will get scratched. I use a lot of small towels inbetween all contact points of the bikes to keep them from scratching.
1,bad product,"this product was terrible. I bought for a gift, husband ddint use until after the timeline for refunds had expired. This is supposed to be a carrier for 4 bikes, but after installing the 2nd one., the whole think snapped and broke off. I should have known not to buy this kind of stuff on line :( Kids were very disappointed since we couldn't go away for a bike ride away from home."
2,Fell apart in 9 months,"Well, this fell apart in 9 months. And even though it was made for 4 bikes, they all had to be adult bikes as it isn't designed to hold kids bikes."
4,Allen Deluxe 4-Bike Trunk Mount Rack,"Used the Allen Deluxe 4-Bike rack on my 2005 Toyota Sienna. Fit well and held four (4) bikes (2 Adult, 2 midsize) securely on a 6 hour trip. I had to use a ladder to install the rack. It made a couple of small scratches on the rear hatch of my van but that could have been my vault with the way I installed it. If I had had a trailer hitch on my van I probalby would have purchase a different rack. But all in all I am happy with this Allen Deluxe rack and its performance."
4,Allen bike rack awesome!!!,"I wasn't sure how this bike rack was going to work on my vehicle, but as soon as I took it out the box it seemed very simple and straightforward. Granted my neighbors did have some suggestions for me as I put it on my Honda van, but overall very easy to use. I also had some concerns about durability and stability but the bikes were secure and survived a 500 kilometer (250 mile) trip down to the southwest coast of Washington. Now that I have used it a few times, and taken it on and off the car I would recommend it highly to anyone!"
4,overall good,"This is about the only FOUR bike trunk mount rack we could find. All the rest were trailer mount and our van doesnt have a trailer hitch. It installs super easily and once you figure out how to place the bikes to fit them its pretty simple, but that first time is a bit of a puzzle. Once they were on the bikes and wheels didnt move and were quite secure. Overall we were very pleased with this rack."
3,"Good Price, Not Easy to Use","The price was good and I hoped to use the rack for four bikes. No way. Maybe for lean racing bikes, but my road bike and two kids bikes were a tight squeeze. Also, you have to lift the bikes over your head to get them on the rack since the bar is at a steep angle when trunk mounted. Once on, I felt the rack was safe and the bikes secure."
3,Works Well,"The bike rack works well, the only thing I don't like is how the bike straps tend to slide down and closer to the car which could cause your bike to touch your car and scratch. Installation of rack is easy and loading and unloading bike is quick."
1,Compatibility Warning,"Warning, the actual box of this product lists the makes and models that it is not compatible with. Please check the manufacturer's website before you order. It otherwise seems like a great rack. What a shame."
5,4-Bike rack,"Fast delivery, Worked great, took hardly any time to install. Installed with one person. and easy to remove. I am pleased with the product."
3,Do NOT open the door after you have bikes mounted.,"Against all advice, I opened the door of our Dodge Caravan after mounting the bikes on the rack. Now the door has dents and we have trouble opening the door. big mistake. There aren't many racks that can hold 4 bikes that don't attach to the hitch. We drove across the country with 3 bikes and a Trail-a-bike on this rack, probably should not have done that. buyer beware."
1,The game did not work at all.,This game did not work at all. It froze on the first title screen. My son was so excited to play & it did not work...
2,Clips scratch car and mounting is a pain,The metal mounting clips scratched the edges of my trunk lid. I'm more meticulous than the average person and was still not able to place the clips in such a way that they would not wear on the lip of my trunk lid. This issue also made the mounting process inconveniently long. I since added a tow hitch and hitch rack and am very happy with that setup. Overall quality seemed pretty good.
4,tough to beat,"Using this rack on our minivan. Run it with 2 adult mountain bikes, a BMX bike and a youth bike. Hold them all pretty steady. I did manage to break one of the 8 straps on the bike tube cradle, but that was from being too aggressive in tightening down. Replaced broken buckle and strap with a hook and loop unit and am back in business. The top straps supporting the rack slipped a little on me, but I was not following all the directions. Added a ""webbing slide"" as an extra lock down and the the slipping is gone. I recommend lashing/tying the wheels together to keep the bikes quiet, but that is more of a tip. I feel we got a quality product at a great price."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE RACK - CAUSED DAMAGE TO MY CAR,We bought this bike rack to transport bikes from VA to SC for Spring Break. On the return trip (the second time we used the rack) the cheap bumper pad split while we were driving and the rack caused hundreds of dollars of damage to the back of the car. I highly recommend you choose a rack of better construction and quality.
1,WARNING! Poorly made and may cause accidents,"This rack actually fit fine and carried the bikes properly. But on the very first use, the most important top hook dis-attached from its strap (must have been glued/sewed improperly). Fortunately, we were almost home. If this had happened on the highway, it could have caused death/injury to cars behind us (aside from destroying all of our bikes and rack.). Wow, we dodged a bullet and are popping this baby back in the mail!"
3,Be careful,"We purchased this product so we could haul 4 bikes at the same time we are towing a popup camper. The tow vehicle is a 2008 Aspen SUV. In that situation there are some options but they are limited. We also wanted something we could use whether or not we are towing the camper, so a camper-mounted rack was out. The good news is that 4 bikes fit on the rack with very little problem - I rotated the handlebars on bike #1 90 degress to help the puzzle fit but that was the only modification. The bad news is, when we arrived at our destination there was some damage to the rear door of our vehicle, where the lower bar rests. That is a lot of weight, and apparently that part of the door could not handle it. There are a couple small dents, which are not exceedingly hideous but are noticable. I am considering adding some kind of buffer to that area, something that can absorb / distrubute the weight without incurring further damage to the door. Anybody have any suggestions?"
1,minivan owners beware,"We read all the reviews before purchasing. All but one seemed to be very good, so we figured the one bad review had just installed the item improperly. We wished that we had listened! We installed the rack on our minivan and double checked it to make sure all was sturdy. We were only traveling about 2 miles and only carrying 2 bikes, but the portion of the rack that was against the top part of the hatch completely crushed the car hatch and the bikes were nearly falling off the vehicle. This product should not be used on a minivan!!!!! We have quite a bit of damage for a 2 mile ride and needless to say we are returning the item for another car rack. If you own a minivan, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
1,not enough info online,"I never got to use the product. Online it says that it fits most SUVs, minivans, etc. When the package arrived, right on the back of the box it lists which cars it does and does not fit. Mine, of course, was listed as one it does NOT fit. That info should be listed online because then I would have known to never buy it in the first place."
2,womens timex watch,Great watch with easy to set alarm. Although it quit working when the battery died. I replaced the battery but the watch quit working.
5,Awesome!,"Once again Pat has outdone himself on this new album. It's awesome!! He's written all but one of the songs on this album showing what a great songwriter he is! It's hard to chose a favorite but I guess I'd have to say ""Wave on Wave"" especially when you hear it live! Pat rocks! This is a must have for all you Texas music lovers!Keep on rockin' that Tx. music!--Enjoy"
5,Wave on Wave is the best,Wave on Wave is the best CD I have ever owned. Pat's music is great to me because I can listen to his songs over and over again without getting tired of them. I recomend this CD 100%.
1,This boy has lost his way,"The cover of this CD says it all. Maybe he should change his name from Patrick to Patricia???Whats next Pat? tight jeans , a 2 tone shirt and a big hat?At his best he is an energetic Texas Country Rocker and at his worst is the garbage he spews on this CD"
1,Texas Sized Disappointment,"Pat Green had been one of my favorite artists untill now. I hope he stays in California, he belongs out there. For anyone wanting Texas music, try his earlier cd's. Way to keep it Texas Pat."
1,ripped off,"I know i'm not the only one who noticed that ""wave on wave"" is a blatantly obvious ripoff of Mike and the Mechanics' ""In the Living Years"". I dare you to say otherwise. There are forums all over the internet with posts from really pissed off fans like myself. Even if you're not musically inclined, the similarity is striking. Even my mom picked up on it when it played on the local country station. Bottom line is: Green is marginally talented, but that is overshadowed by his total lack of artistic integrity. I am surprised that there has not been a bigger backlash regarding the song. Oh and a word of caution regarding the rest of this so called, er..., critically acclaimed album: I'd venture to say that the lyrics are pulled straight out of a confused teenager's journal. If rambling, nonsensical musings about broken hearts and redemption are what you're after, then Pat Green is your guy. Utterly disgraceful."
4,"Pretty good music, but some lyric warnings.","i think that some of these lyrics on this cd is terrible. look at elvis it says i am the KING OF KINGS... all we as christians know that there is only one king of KING OF KINGS and Lord Of Lords. look at All the Good Things Fade Away. it say a foul language. the bad part is that it says 3 time foul language and if i was the devil is REALLY HORRIBLE, but wrapped , wave on wave , guy like me... even though that does have some foul language in the song... it is pretty cooli just LOVE the song poetry. it's a REAL COOL song. i am not downing anyone about this cd. it's pretty cool. i think elvis is a pretty cool song, because willie nelson is in it and you don't hear country classic singers on 2003 cds anymore that much."
1,Pat Green has forgotten his roots,"Wave on wave, Pat's old CD, took Pat Green's career and springboarded it with songs with real lyrics and great melodies. Unfortunately, this CD seriously strays from what Pat is good at and replaces it with a form of ""country"" that many of Pat's old fans will agree is far from the Texas country tunes we have come to appreciate. Seriously, ever since Pat got married, his lyrics have gone soft. Who wants to hear about California? Let's listen to songs about what the heart of Texas country is based on: drinking beer, going to parties, and just having fun. Pat, what happened?I highly recommend against the purchase of this CD, and would advise people to buy his old CD, ""3 Days,"" or get a cd from a real Texas country artist, like Cory Morrow or Robert Earl Keen. Then you will hear what TEXAS country is all about"
1,Forget Patsy Green,"Has anyone who calls ol' P. Green a Texas ""Songwriter"" ever heard of Guy Clark, Townes Van Damn Van Zandt, Willie, or Waylon? (and I could name 50 others) Patsy couldn't carry their jock strap, and it makes my stomach turn to hear people fall all over themselves gushing over him. I just don't get the fascination. So, the point is, if you are new to Texas music, try one of the folks I mentioned above and forget Green. If you already consider yourself a fan of Green's, then you are already lost and I can't help you."
3,tiny,I bought this book for an autistic kid and it looked about A4 size on the internet which would be easy to read. So surprised to find a tinsy winsy book which might be hard to navigate. However it is not advertised as teaching tool for autistic kids. Even so I think it would be good to know just how small this book is because as an adult with all my faculties (ha!) I am not sure people in foreign countries would necesarrily recognize the photos not familiar to them so small. I traveled in China it would have been good there.
5,Point It,"I have studied Italian for 5 years. But I bought Point It and am using it to work with an Italian instructor to test my language translating skills because it is so comprehensive. It's my ""visual vocabulary and traveler's situation"" guide. My husband and I will also use it when we travel around Turkey and Greece by car."
5,massively useful!,"This is such a great little book! Perfect for travelling in Asia. It also is a GREAT tool to teach vocabulary to young children, and expose them to things that are out there in the world. Every young child should have one of these. Great for learning new languages, too."
3,"good idea, meh execution","this is a book full of outdated photos. it's not easy to navigate, but it is small. if you're looking for something with all substance and no flash, you've found it here. since it has no words in it, you can use it for any language. in theory it is great. i have been traveling for a year and have not used it once. but i still carry it because i think just maybe i'll need it."
2,point it,"The pictures of items in this book are way to small. I cannot see how it will be helpful at all. Between the cost of the book, plus shipping, close to $10 is a ridiculous amount for this book."
5,Travel aide,"This was a gift for a friend who travels worldwide quite a lot. She thought it was a nifty gift. The book is small enough that it would fit into a day pack or purse easily. But, because it is small, the pictures are also small. Not so small that they aren't useful. Just don't expect large pictures. I just really quickly looked at it, but from what I could tell, there's no index. So you'd have to familiarize yourself with the book to be able to quickly find the picture you need. Otherwise, I think it would be a handy travel aide. It has the typical ""needs"" pictured - food choices, bathrooms, etc."
5,Great!,"I had drifted awya from bluegrass after listening to the same old tired songs performed in the same way by too many different bands, but this group has brought me back. It's uplifting, danceable and different enough to deserve to be a whole new genre...it's like the next generation of ""new""grass."
5,LEARN ALL ABOUT LEE MASSACHUSETTS,"This book was written with love and caring by a life-long resident of Lee, a member of one of Lee's historic (yet current) families.The book is well written, fully indexed and has hundreds of wonderful, historic photographs.If you want to know more about the town of Lee, its history and its people ... this is the book to read."
2,disappointed with the new changes,"Too many changes to the magazine recently. It has lost my favorite sections. I miss the crossword puzzles, word finds, Quiet Moments and Susan Koenig's articles. ):"
3,Better than average,"Unfortunately this Sonata is rarely performed, and when it is performed, it is performed with some weird taste. This is the example. Who ever said that Rachmaninoff should be ""pregnant"" (in Mustonen's case, where every measure has swellings), or that it should sound like Scarlatti? Did you know that Russian phrasing comes from our endless horizons? Thats where the long line is appropriate :) But I didn't hear it in neither recording that I heard.... Too sad, because the music is incredible...!"
2,sound switch doesn't respond,"After several months of some use, the sound switch will not respond to the frequency setTHe loud high-frequency sirening sound is not longer working, just the strobe light .Also, the 4 big batteries need to be replace too often.I give it 2 stars because it work well at the beginning, with the loud sound, then it did not longer work ( and I take a great care of the unit)"
2,Returned it :-(,This just didn't work well...sometimes it worked when it was suppose to & sometimes it didn't :-( we found it to be useless & not helpful. We returned it...
4,Good protection against otters,"This works well to keep otters off of docks and out of boats. Unfortunately, they only seem to last about one year. I have had otters poop all over a boat and dock and chew up boat seats. It's worth the price, for sure."
1,"Pure Junk, buy the Weitech instead.","I have been sucessfully using the Weitech Yard protector continuously for two years. But I keep the frequency set for cats only. Any other frequency may irritate the neighborhood dogs.Unfortunately, a band of racoons recently began to terrorize my pond at night. So I decided to add a second motion sensitive pest repeller. I had hoped the Lentek yard control would compliment the Weitech. BUT, the Lentek is a piece of junk right out of the box. The motion sensor immediately activates and never turns off. It would not be so bad if the strobe light was not constantly flashing. I plan on trashing the Lentek and buying another Weitech."
2,Very disappointed,"This item doesn't work very well. For starters, the range of motion detection is about 4-5 feet, not the 30 feet claimed by the manufacturer. Once triggered, the sound and strobe light only activate for a short period (1-2 seconds) so that it's really not all that distracting for the racoons. It sounds constantly when it rains. And finally, it takes a long time to reset once it's been triggered. I purchased the unit to keep the raccoons away from my garbage cans, and it helps to some degree, but it does not keep them away permanently as I had anticipated."
1,doesn't work,"we had a barking dog problem. The neighbor tried all sorts of creative and useless ways to stop it, one of which was this. It kept the dog quite for maybe 20 to 30 seconds then he quickly figured out it was just more background noise and completely ignored it. Perhaps we should have just used it as a club?"
1,"It does not work, Tech support is useless","Just bought the device, does not activate unless you are 6 inches in front of it. So, it is not very effective unless the animal walks really close to the device. Tried to speek with tech support but they don't really help, they want me to ship them the item with my money although it is a product defect."
1,Does not perform as advertised,"I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased 2 units. When you get the unit, the documentation packed inside clearly states that the range is 15 feet. Check the advertisement here and note it leads you to believe the range is 30 feet. What's more...I totally agree with several of the reviewers here who have stated that it's more like 5 feet. Also, we found that it triggers on things like spinklers and rain...that means you have a repeated and annoying activation...aside from wearing down the batteries.The very best thing about this whole deal was that the seller was ""As-seen-on-TV"". They were very understanding and not happy about the product. They provided a full refund.The manufacturer completed ignored my concerns. I checked their web site and found that they were inconsistent in describing the coverage sometimes as a 30-foot circle, and elsewhere as a 360-degree, 30-foot radius."
1,"PISSED, CANT GET LOWER THEN 1 STAR","SELLER AND AMAZON HAS GIVEN ME NO HELP ON THIS ORDER. I HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR A MONTH TO RECEIVE THIS ORDER BACK AND FORTH TO SELLER AND AMAZON WITH NO HELP FROM EITHER, I WANT MY MONEY RETURNED"
4,Review of A Twist of Lemon,"The author was an account executive at Dancer-Fitzgerald-Sample, one of the top advertising agencies of its day. Characters in the book can be identified with people in the agency, including Mix Dancer, Cliff Fitzgerald, Bill Weilbacher, Holly Smith, the author and some secretaries."
2,Died after a month. Replaced it with a Channel Master 3412,"Four outputs is handy but quit working after a month. Even when it did work it was only fair reception of broadcast digital TV signals. No channels in the ""green"" for signal strength. They were in the lower half of yellow and couldn't get one at all. I had 3 TV's connect After unit burned out, bought a Channel Master CM-3412 for half the money and used a splitter for TVs 2 and 3. Got green reception on all channels but one that was on the high end of yellow. Received every digital channel available in the area. Only question is how long it will last."
1,poor signal quality,"I'm really disappointed with this booster. I bought it to split my cable signal between two DVRs and a cable modem, but I get poor signal quality (artifacts in the video, etc.) through the booster. I actually get a better signal by daisy-chaining two unboosted Y-splitters. Too bad I already tossed the receipt... this is a rare example of a product that's so bad I'd take it bad for a refund."
1,oh YUCK!!!!!!!!,"I can't believe it. I have Sailor Moon S uncut with English subtitles. and they changed the dialogue SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much. I can't beleive they would do that. The make dorky little puns out of cool phrases, and the voices sound horrible. Also, those covers are nasty. I hate these tapes. They should offer the original dialogue. What maakes me even madder is that when they DO subtitle it, they even change the subtitles!!!!!!! I CANNOT BELEIVE THEY WOULD DO THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Changing the subtitles so it is stupid. This show was meant for teens, not six year olds. This is supposed to be like it is. You aren't supposed to change it!!! It was meant for teens, so it may have some teen situations, they shouldn't adjust it so it is suitible for little kids. What about US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! man, it makes me so mad. I would love to give you a site where you can get them uncut with english subtitles, but I don't know if I should. MAN, it makes me MAD!!!!!!!!! Sailor Twilight"
2,subs vs. dubs,"i can't believe you ppl. HAPPY that the editing staff took a machete to our poor sailor moon? if they take out the ""homosexual themes"", what do they take out next? what about teh stars season? I've got news for you ppl. Sailor Moon was *not* originally intended for three year olds, you know. It was a shojou manga. A teenage school girl's book. and why can't teenagte girls (my self included) have some romance to read about? even if the romance is homo sexual. are you sayijng there's something wrong with that?"
5,Sailor Moon S Rules,"I'm a big fan of the S series even though I love the SuperS series more because it has Pegasus, Super Senshi, and the Amazoness Quartet, but this sereis is really cool. I would buy the tape if I wasn't broke. And to those people who think the new voice actors/actoress suck. GET OUT OF TOWN...GO HOME! They rule! I like Mimet. She's such a clutz but you got to like her. My favorite episode in this series, is the one Hotaru becomes Sailor Saturn. Mistress 9 asks her why she won't die, and Hotaru thinks of her father and Rini and goes...BECAUSE I HAVE ONES I LOVE!! The whole series. If you haven't seen them on TV you should. Where have you been??? Anyway enjoy the video if you buy it!"
3,Sailor Moon S Pure Hearts,"This is the first 4 episodes of the Sailor Moon S series. It is the 3rd season. However, when I put it in, Serena sounded like a nagging old lady. Amy's voice had also changed into a softer tone. Overall, the episodes were good, the last one on the tape being my favorite."
4,Sailor Moon...,"I just rented this movie from the local video store because I have been looking inot Sailor Moon for a little while now. I have only watched the first episode and part of the second one so far. I like the feature-leangth movies better then the episodes. I noticed that Mini Moon's voice was a lot more childish and sweet then in the movie Sailor Moon Bacl Dream Hole. This time her voice is friendly like a little girl, and not so much like a little brat. Overall I'd really give this movie a 3.5."
4,Before they were big!!,"Daymon Wayans was a name when this came out, just not a big one! The really funny thing is watching Bill Maher before he found his political niche, trying to do just straight comedy. I must admit that even with that I loved these shows! In this tape Wayans is the better comedian."
4,Out of the Dark World,"Out of the Dark World was an ""okay"" book. Most of my friends who have read it, thought it was good, basically all of them. I personally didn't like it because I thought it got a little boring at times, but it was exciting considering there was magic involved, etc. From a 1-5 rating I would rate it a 4 because there were times where I got bored and I don't really like these kinds of books. I would recommend this book to anyone who is able to keep their attention to a book, and a person who will read a book even if it has to do with magic. Which, I think, makes it funner. It's mainly just about Sue and Meg and how they use magic to go to the ""Dark World,"" and end up doing some pretty weird things. It's very exciting and overall, I enjoyed this book."
2,Calendar,Calendar not working right from the beginning of operation of the clock!Very bad quality!Calendar not working right from the beginning of operation of the clock!Very bad quality!
4,Pretty watch,"Nice big watch. Easy to use. Cream-colored face with swirls is pretty, and you can't see that in the photo. Only one problem: the alarm is on the right side of the dial. If the watch slides down to your wrist you're likely to push the alarm stem in with the back of your hand and you'd never know you'd turned it off until you missed the thing you set the alarm for.This is my second easy-set Expedition. The first told time for 10 years, but the alarm died the first time I changed the battery (after about 3 years). Still, you just cannot beat that price."
4,Great but not perfect,"I wanted a watch to use to time short meditation sessions and the Easy Set feature on this watch is great for that. I just wish it had a vibrating alarm option so it would be quieter in certain settings the beeping is disruptive. Also I wish the tiny little markers that spin around indicating when the alarm is set to go off were a little bigger, they are very small and kind of hard to see."
4,Good Watch,"I've enjoyed this watch for quite some time, and would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a nice, easy to use watch that has more than one function. The metal is well made, the leather band has not had any problems and even the face has remained unscratched, which for me is amazing!I've come to find that Timex watches are a much better choice than most watches I buy. Their cost is low, their design is solid and their functionality is always nice."
3,Nice watch but I can't hear the alarm,"Watch looks nice, gives accurate time, and alarm works easily/accurately. The only problem is, I can't hear the alarm when it goes off. If you have any high frequency hearing loss (like me) you probably shouldn't buy this one. I agree with another reviewer...wouldn't it be great if it had a vibrating alarm?"
4,Timex Quick Set,"Was about what I expected. I did note the white hands against a white background outlined in black was not as easy to read as an older model I had with black hands on a white background. Also the quick-set alarm indicators were outlined in black and red making them a little harder to see and set, the older model had the indicators a solid color. For these reasons I gave it four stars."
4,A lot of watch for the money,"First the good things.This watch does a lot of things besides just show the time of day. Like all Timex products, the Indiglo backlight feature is great for night, movie theater or other dark place viewing. It has a 2 function alarm: twice / day at the specified time or every hour at the minute setting. The leather band is atractive and high-quality.Now the not so good things:I'm not really wild about the styling of this watch. The face itself looks great but is small and disproportionally overwhelmed by the bezel. Setting the alarm takes practice getting down pat. Once that's been figured out, it has a good sound - louder than alarms on other inexpensive watches. One really bad thing is the stem which controls having the alarm turned on in either mode is easy to push in which turns it off. This can happen by simply flexing your wrist. What good is an alarm if you can't be confident it has been set?For under $40 however, I'd buy this watch again."
2,Date Difficult to Set/Alarm Very Low,"The watch feels and looks very good on my wrist and feels comfortable. The issues I have are that I don't like the alarm or date set features. I decided that since I will seldom, if ever, use the alarm function I could live with the extremely soft beep sound it emits. Way too soft to awaken me. Setting the date function is elusive as you can't tell if you have the day setting aligned to 12 noon or 12 midnight (when the day changes) so it's easy to be 12 hours off, and then when attempting to correct this there is no indication or feel that you have done so correctly so you may end up off 12 hours in the opposite direction from where you started. It can be frustrating and it's a process you have to go through whenever there is a month with fewer than 31 days. If Timex could fix the day set issue I'd be happy to give this 4 stars and if they would also do something about the faint alarm sound it would easily get 5."
5,Excellent value,"This watch rocks! The two easy set alarms are just that easy to set. I believe that I wll get a lot of use out of this watch. It was a bargain. I have more expensive watches with fewer benefits. Read the other good reviews on this watch, purchase and enjoy."
5,I am so glad I found this watch!,"I love this watch. I had the same one in a women's style a few years ago and lost it. Every watch I have had since then doesn't compare. The outside ring that sets the time, within the hour alarm, and the regular alarm is so easy to use. I also love the feature of the within the hour alarm, I use it as a timer to remember things and for a quick 10-15 min.nap. I love that it is water resistant and has the indigo light as well. Very useful when you are on the go. Like the old motto, This watch does take a licking and keeps on ticking, great for campers, sports and working with kids."
2,Good while it lasted,"The easy-set alarm is great -- fast and convenient. However, the alarm became unreliable after about 2 years, as it depends on the tiny pull-out stem to activate it, which became sticky, and therefore the alarm sometimes fails to go off. An unreliable alarm is worse than no alarm. Another problem: the leather wristband became very smelly after a few months. When it gets wet -- from hand-washing or sweat -- it gets stinky, and cannot be removed. It leaves your wrist smelling bad too. Cleaning the wristband with leather cleaner did not help. And yes, it's big and clunky, but I don't really mind that. I like this product in principle, but unfortunately, durability and build quality issues make it a short-term disposable."
5,Very good watch for my needs,"I am very happy with my watch. At first I was puzzled because I could not get the date to move forward correctly. I was a few weeks in when I figured out the watch had no way of knowing when was AM or PM, so I had to move the hands until I saw the calendar move then it worked perfectly.The alarm is loud, but not too loud. It's just right. For the price I got a great product that fit my needs."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS POS,THIS MP3 PLAYER IS ABOUT THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER OWNED. IT WORKS SPORADICALLY AND CUSTOMER SERIVCE FROM SONIC BLUE CHARGES YOU FROM DAY 91. THEY ARE AWFUL AND WILL NOT FOLLOW UP AS PROMISED. BY A COMPAQ NOMAD OR SAMSUNG MP3 PLAYER BUT TO BUY ANYTHING FROM RIO/SONIC BLUE YOU WILL BE SORRY. EXTREMELY SORRY.
4,FIX the Rio 800,"Tech support,I have owned my Rio 800 for one year before any problems developed.And I think I have found the problems.The problem IS NOT the battery as it is.I tested my battery and it is fine after it is charged.The problem is with the software in the Rio player's POWER SAVER MODE.If the player is on long enough for the power saver time to shut it off, the player will not come back on at all- even if you remove the backpack and replace it.When I turned the POWER SAVER off, the player played for 3 or 4 hours with no problems.But when I powered the unit off, I could not just power it back on. I had to remove and replace the backpack for it to work, even though the POWER SAVER MODE was set to off.Which means, the Rio unit is shorting out the battery.(Before, I only had to charge the battery every other day and I would have the player on two and a half hours every day while working out.)I hope this helped"
1,Horrible product-Stay away from Sonicblue products,"When you buy a product full of bugs and then face customer service that demands your credit card as after the first 90 days calls to support cost you [money]! Downloads through the RioPort software end up sounding horrible with squeals throughout. Don't download upgrades to the software as you will receive annoying requests to pay them even more money. ... The software is as buggy as the player. Plan on having to remove the backpack to shut it off as it freezes constantly. Regardless of what they tell you replace the Nickel Metal Hydride battery with one from [another store] as soon as possible. Whatever you do, buy a different MP3 player. Don't listen at your own risk."
1,Piece of junk,"I ordered the player so that I could use it to listen to Audibles.com books. I received the first one and was impressed with what appeared to be a nice player. It worked for 2 hours before the sound went out. I tried to contact Sonic Blue for support and was told that they would talk to me for a $19.99 charge. Amazon's customer service was excellent and they sent me a replacement the next day,which lasted for about 1 hour before the battery died and will not hold a charge. I am going to suggest that Audible.com remove this from their list of suggested players and find a company with better quality control and a more reliable product."
2,Rio 800 is a pain in the butt,"I got this little guy for Christmas 2002 and I was so excited to have one. Well, after figuring out that you had to calibrate the battery, I thought I was good to go. You wouldn't know to calibrate the battery until you read the directions, which I think is horrible considering most (like me) just plug it in to charge w/o the directions. Well, the battery drains itself and I have never been able to keep it running for more than a few hours. I think the look, feel, sound, and even the amount of memory (mine has 128 mb) are great, but what good is any of that if you cannot keep power to it. The night before I wanted to use it I unplugged it after a full charge... by the time I went to workout the next day, the battery in it was dead. DO NOT BUY RIO -- their product stinks! I will never buy another!"
1,Beware - Deplorable Customer Service,"...Because I enjoy listening to audio books and mp3 music, I purchased a ... Rio 800 128 MB that was under warranty. The unit unfortunately had a defective headphone jack, a problem with a simple solution. Obtain an RMA (return of merchandise authorization) number and send the unit back for repair...."
4,Great player,"I was a little worried after reading the posts about battery problems, but haven't encountered any problems. I've gone upwards of 4 hours without charging, and the indicator still indicates the battery is near full charge. I did have to calibrate it twice before it held a full charge (the limited instructions don't mention this).The biggest dissapointment is the tinny uncomfortable headphones that come with it.Sounds great! Use with an adapter in the car and it sounds as good or better than the CD. If you get the 64mb model, you'll be buying the memory upgrade soon."
4,"Great Player, Even greater with third party Software","I have had this player now for almost three weeks and it works perfectly for me. My only problem is the software on the computer, what ever happened to drag and drop capabilities. Though there are several third party alternatives.Other than that I am extremely happy with my Rio. It never skips and with the USB it has an extremely fast transfer rate. It only takes me about 2 minutes to copy over all my songs that I want to listen to.I would highly recommend this product to any one. I have had no problems with it to this point."
3,Great player...if it works,"I ordered a Rio over a month ago. When I first got it there was a strange glitch in the sound, certain frequencies seemed almost completely cut out (in the vocal range) which led to some terrible sounding music. It sounds like at least one other person here had the same problem. Other than this the player was great, everything I wanted and more. The sound was even very good, within the range that it could play.Long story short: due to the fact that I ordered directly from SONICblue it took 20+ days for me to get a return authorized and I didn't want to go through this again. Hopefully the Nomad II MG that's on the way turns out better."
1,"THIS ONE DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE A ""1""","What a disappointment...thought we could be one of the lucky ones...but, alas...our battery didn't hold a charge either - said it had 8 hours left...more like 8 seconds! The sound quality isn't what we expected either - some static and skipping. Instruction booklet is useless and the Riohome.com website is informationless!..."
1,Not Good Choice! Get an Intel Personal 3000 MP3 Player!,"First of all, the picture is misleading... It looks sleak and cool but it really doesn't... The Intel Personal Audio Player can be more the way you want it and the faceplates are a small cost! It also take forever to transfer songs from the computer to the MP3 Player, and I have a brand new Pentium 4 so it is't cause I have a poor quality computer. With the Intel Personal Audio Player, it takes a split second! Plus the SONICblue Rio 800 64MB Digital Audio Player had horrible features... It doesn't have good bass or treble control. Plus the sound isn't as clear as the Intel MP3 PLayer... Plus have you ever heard of the company SONICblue? Well Intel can assure you that you will have a quality MP3 Player..."
5,LUV MY RIO 800,"I've had my Rio 800 for the last four months and have had zero problems with it. The sound quality is great. The voice recording was a plus. I haven't had any of the problems that everyone seems to be having. I love it, I love it, I love it. I'm one satisfied customer.The one thing which I really didn't care for, but found that it was (to me) utterly useless was the Rio software. I'd suggest to anyone thinking about buying a Rio 800 that they use Windows Media Player 7 to load files onto their player. (...)"
2,WARNING: The RIO 800 has a BATTERY LEAK issues,"The Rio800 claims to have +10 hours of battery life, but it has a serious leakage problem when the device is powered down. I would recharge the battery to 100%, unplug the charger, and leave the device powered down for a day or two. When I come back the battery level is at less than 50%. ... The whole 10+ battery life is a load of crap...Don't take my word for it, go out and pay for one and see for yourself...BTW, the software package is horrible... use Window's Media Player instead."
1,"Same story, different verse",My son who has had 2 MP3's could not get this one to work correctly. It has a buzzing sound. It looks like such a good product it is a shame it is apparently junk.
1,No More Rio for Me,"After buying 2 Rio 600s for my kids, which worked great, I figured I would get an 800 for myself. I pulled the Rio 800 out of the box and followed the directions before use. I was initially having problems getting MP3/WMA files loaded, but when they did, it sounded great. After a month of limited use, I started having problems hearing the vocal track. OK, SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM: I have made numerous attempts to contact the support department for the Rio 800, and I have sent many emails. No response. I have no problem with Rio products and I was willing to return my Rio 800 for another, or whatever it took to resolve the issue. However, I'm disappointed when a company doesn't respond to the paying customer. After reading several reviews I see this is an on-going problem. Sorry Rio, but you have lost my business and I recommend others look elsewhere."
1,Find another digital audio player,"This device is not worth the hassle. I returned the first one because it just didn't work and the second one is very flaky. The rechargable battery doesn't work correctly; the unit constantly reboots, and Sonicblue's technical support is non-responsive and not helpful.I also have a Rio 500 and it is a much better choice for your money."
1,SonicBlue support is the worst I've ever seen,"I have a Rio 800 and read about a problem with the charger/adapter on the SonicBlue website. I submitted the online form a month ago and never heard back. I sent e-mail to customer support a few weeks ago and never heard back. Today I waited on hold for 30 minutes to get a customer support person who then gave me a different customer support number to call! That was an 800 number, but when they answer, they tell you the call will cost $19.95! I advise everyone to stay away from this company and get Apple's wonderful iPod. You will be much happier."
2,Needs Improvement,"I just got this player yesterday and already it doesn't seem to be working. I calibrated the battery and this morning when I started using it, the device powered-off after the first hour. So, I am recharging it as we speak. The design is okay. The device looks better than it really is. The software is terrible because it isn't intuitive. The documentation, Help Topics or the User Guide, that comes with the package are terribly written. I have also heard a lot of other people complaining about the battery. I certainly hope I do not have the same problem. Other than the problems aforementioned, the player is OKAY."
4,Almost Perfect,This is an awesome device. It is very small and plays high quality music in mp3 format. The only fault I see with it is the voice recorder. It is almost inaudible (maybe this one is defective). I was picturing a voice memo recorder that would be as clear as a tape recorder. I guess I will just use it for music.
4,"Awesome player, horrible earphones.","I think the player is excellent. Sound quality, ease of use and absolutely no problems with the software or transferring songs. Downloads are very fast and all options are easy to use. The only thing keeping the fifth star away is the earphones that came with it. They are horrible and terribly painful. Once you get a different pair, you are on easy street. Oh, and one other thing, I almost lost a finger or two trying to open the package it came in. Be careful."
1,Broken,"I recieved a Rio for a birthday present and I thought it was a great gift until I opened it and it didn't work. I sent it back thinking that it was a mishap and upon recieving my second one, one week later it just stopped working. I think the idea of downloading music is great but the Rio800 needs to be revised as a product."
1,"Terrible MP3, Do Not Buy!","I bought this MP3 player 2 months ago, and I bought it thinking I would have the best one on the market. When I opened the box,I raced to the computer and installed the software. When I first listened to the music, the sound Quality was terrible, I couldn't believe my ears! I had spent almost 300$ on this worthless item! Take my word for it and DO NOT BUY!"
4,this is why ATL is Hot,"P.A. proves that they are truly holding down the south. The music on this cd is very creative with a lot ""bump"" for the trunk. If you dig Outkast, Jim Crow, and Yougbloodz, you have to pick this up. Lyrically they might not be the best coming out GA but their diverse style, and pimped out lyrics make up for any percieved short-commings. Sundown with 8-ball makes this a must have, but they got more heat than that on the cd. Check Just Like That, Playaz Do, and Problems to name few. I hope they don't get sleep on this time around."
5,An excellent book to understand Roman urbanization,"This book greatly elucidates emperor Hadrian's benefactions to the cities in the Roman Empire. Mary Boatwright has expertly researched Hadrian's paternalism towards the cities; however, she argues that Hadrian wanted the cities to remain loyal to Roman institutions. The author also recognizes the Greco-Roman syncretic cultural aspects prevalent during Hadrian's reign as emperor. Lastly, an excellent survey of Roman urbanization and cultural legacy. The maps, tables, and illustrations added to my understanding and reading enjoyment."
1,This book sure sucks!,I really can't recommend this book. The NURBS section sucks big time (so does the NURBS -section in Vol I). For example I expected the book to show proper U-Lofting (at least some tips and tricks) - what you get is the explanation how to U-Loft if you already got the Curves!
2,"Riddled with errors, but contains some useful material...","If you're looking for a high quality book, with excellent examples and superb accompanying CD, you've unfortunately found the wrong book! This is riddled with errors; filenames incorrectly referred to, paths within sample files referring to New Riders own servers, files missing, incorrect steps in the tutorials, etc.The quality of the finished product in each tutorial is also poor, a sad reflection on the quality of the overall book. IF this book _has_ been quality tested, (which I HIGHLY doubt!), I can only say that the authors have some serious problems and are suffering from delusions of adequacy.For the price you pay, certainly not worth it, unless you REALLY need to learn your materials and can't find ANY other source."
2,Modelling? What modelling?,"I wanted to learn in depth modelling (as the title says, no?). Well, the book has sections on higr-res, low-res, humans, ... modelling, but mostly just general blabla talk. It DOESN't explain in depth how to use NURBS, for example. You'll be able to do simple nurbs after this book, but that's it. Pretty dissapointing I say, for a book that's supposed to be the best modeling book around. Materials: I haven't looked in to that part yet, but the examples in the middle of the book are crappy."
4,Great Jerk Material,this has interviews in it which angered me a little. Other than that great Jerk material.
3,Julius is jazzy,"Julius is a very unconventional pig who loves jazz music, dressing up, and eating peanut butter out of the jar. Maya teaches Julius manners, which he reluctantly learns, then later uses because he loves Maya. It's a fun, non-whimsical and non-preachy story of friendship. Kids 'get' the moral (bringing out the best in your friend by loving them and sharing your own interests with them) without being hit over the head with it. The excellent facial expressions (esp on the parents' faces) really tell the story.The illustrations are very engaging -- brightly patterned bits of cloth, some creative distortion of perspective, etc. The African-American family looks like it was modeled on real, living individuals -- a refreshing change from the generic white-person-colored-black look.This is a great picture book for those of you who are tired of the pastel world of books for the under-7 set."
4,Not a how-to book,"The lady from California is right: beautiful and stunning. A superb coffee table book BUT not a how-to let me show you how one. If you want to make these projects you'll have to buy them from her OR get the Ann Cox Beginner's Guide and learn how. Ms. Eriksson's directions are rather sketchy and terse. An unfortunate after-effect of thiis terseness is that the book feels more like a catalogue, hence the coffee book category, than a craft manual.Most of the projects are superb but towards the end they fall into the Helen Gibb (another Oz ribbon worker) category and become overly-done garish Victoriana. That aside there is some seriously good embroidery here and if get the Ann Cox book you can figure out how to make that all happen. Ann is a superb teacher-artist and her thin volume truly prepares you for the inspiration of Eriksson."
3,"Excellent for killing mosquitoes in the house, but. . .",I have owned the 4 bulb e-trap for over three years. Nothing worse than mosquitoes that come in the house - and the e-trap does attract and kill them with little fuss - BUT the bulbs do not last very long. The first time they went out Lentek sent me an entire replacement unit instead of just the bulbs. Another month went by and they too started to dim. I finally called customer service this year and was told 4 weeks was the average life span for the bulbs. . .so I ordered an entire case of replacements at just under [$$] each. Very expensive! But also the only gadget I have found that kills mosquitoes efficiently in the house without pesticides and such. It now makes me wish I had purchased the two bulb unit instead of the 4 bulb unit!
4,"Okay Book, With A Twist","If you love reading books that keep you wondering what's coming, even when you've read the reviews, you'll love this book. It keeps you wondering the entire time...""What's so bad about Amandine?"" (if you've ever heard the frog in the boiling pot expression this is definatly a time when it shows you how that is very true)The whole time things that are wrong with Amandine are being exposed to you and you seem to never notice it, untill you think back on what you just read. I recommend this book, but its a one day read...you can't put it down!"
3,Could have been much better than it was.,"This is the second book I read by Adele Griffin and while it was okay, I sort of wish I hadn't bought it in hardcover. It's about a friendship between two girls, Delia and Amandine. Delia has a secret that isn't revealed until the end of the book. Amandine, however, is a pathological liar and when Delia catches her in her lies, Amandine accuses Delia's father of molesting her. The situation gets to be so bad that Delia and her family leave town.It could have been a really great story but instead it turned out to be just average. Adele Griffin never really explains why Delia and Amandine are so messed up. And there didn't seem to be any climax or resolution, just straight through. On the whole it was good but it could have been a lot better."
3,Don't bother,"Another contribution to the genre of ""quirky girls with quirky names."" Amandine is a dramatic little minx who plays head games with the narrator, who is a relatively innocent girl. The story is played out with a few twists & turns, but nothing too terribly original.My biggest problem with the book was, the narrator has a deep dark secret that we don't find out about until well into the book. Likewise, her parents have a family secret that we don't find out until very late in the game. These secrets are sprung on us in an ineffective way; they should have been ""issues"" from page one of the book."
2,Just dosn't cut it,"I found this incredibly incipid and stupid. The resolution is stupid, the climax(if you can call it one) is bad, and Amandine, dosn't really do or get herself in to any trouble. If anything, our main charechter Delia, is a ... nutcase. I'll give it 2 stars, because I actually made it through the book. Also, it trys to be all psycholigcal, and teenage angsty but it isn't at all"
2,Amandine,"I think that Amandine by adele Griffin is an exellent book. It tells how tough it is to move from one school to the next and having to worry about making new friends and fitting in.Sometimes in the process we don't always make the right choices. thats what happens to Delia in Amandine. when Delia,an only child, moves from the city to James DeWolf High School her parents constantly badger her on making new friend.And as soon as Delia meets Amandine her parents encourage her to invite her over.When Amandine does finaly come over things take a turn for the worst. Delia is sucked into amandines world of lies.and when Delia tries to get out Amandine makes a move that could hurt Delias entire family and expose the real truth about Delia."
5,A vitally honest look at a destructive personality,"Have you ever had a friend who turned out to be to totally destructive; who began telling everyone your innermost secrets, secrets you'd trusted them with?That's Amandine, and when new to the school, Delia thinks she has found a friend in Amandine, she begins to realize just how vicious, howdisparaging, her `friend' can be.And when Celia, realizing she has to be friends with others and leave Amandine behind, Amandine tries to destroy Celia's family.This is an honest novel, one that would be a terrific book to use in class, since it offers such vital topics for discussion and writing -more than that, all teens and adults should read Amandine - it is thatimportant."
4,Simply a simple book with cartoons to create more Change,"You'll enjoy this small book of creative strategies for effective living using Neuro Associative Conditioning.Notes to a Friends will enlighten you.I've given a few of these to some friends. So Tony if you feel inspired to send me one, I'd love it.I really enjoyed the simplicity of this book for people who want to learn what Tony Robbins is all about in the world of charity, and human potential."
2,Don't Buy Into The Hype,"Ya Know, it still amazes me to see mostly all of tony's books with 4 or 5 star reviews. Yet, these people can't say HOW the book changed their lives, just that it was 'a great book'. I think these people just follow him blindly and swallow any garbage he puts out, it's actually a shame people are this gullible. THis book is a smaller version of ATGW and Unlimited Power. With the silly cartoons and large print, it looks like it's catered to dumb people(who have to be to follow his work) Nothing more than shallow, 'pump up' mumbo jumbo this con man is notorious for."
2,coffeemaniac,This coffee machine is lousy. I traded in my cheap machine for this overpriced model. The coffee tastes like it was made at a restaurant. It also takes double the amount of coffee then the cheaper versions. It is expensive and should make great coffee for the price. Don't buy!!!
2,Luke warm,"Just purchase the Krups Aroma control; Really wish I did not locate it because now I have to spend the time to return it. Drag my wife 2 days looking for this model, and brew 100% Kona coffee as a treat. Just to find out the coffee was lukewarm. My wife added milk which made it taste like ice coffee w/o the ice. What a disappointment. So if the temperature doesn't bother you, then this is the best coffee maker there is...."
2,Not so Good Coffee,"I originally was out to purchase a different coffee maker but came across this new model Krups which claimed to steep ground coffee nearly two minutes during brewing for full flavor. Since Krups has a good reputation and it basically met my requirements for a coffee maker, I decided to give it a try. I tryed to make what I considered a good, strong, rich cup of coffee over the next couple of weeks but was disappointed with each cup of coffee. ...I originally purchased this coffee maker to replace a less expensive coffee maker because I always hated the coffee it brewed. At the price of this Krups, I expected and demanded great coffee! As a result of my disappointment, I returned it and purchased another brand and am finally getting the good cup of coffee I need to wake up in the morning."
5,Excellent coffee and sleek look,"I researched many coffee makers before making our purchase. I could instantly tell the difference in taste of this brand compared to our dependable Mr. Coffee that finally broke down.The coffee tastes as good as the $3.00 cups you buy at the local cafes. We program it to start brewing when we wake up in the morning. Not only does the coffee taste great, it looks appealing on our countertop rather than an ugly appliance just taking up space."
2,"Great coffee, bad engineering","I have had this coffee maker for about a year now, and my patience is finally gone. The aroma control really does make a GREAT cup of coffee, which is why I have put up with this piece of junk for this long. The problem is that the release on the aroma control tends to fail, so the coffee spills over and I end up with coffee all over my desk. I'm not even going to bother fixing the thing as I am not convinced it will ever be a good coffee maker."
2,Black and white copies instead of real DVDs!,I am really disappointed as I bought a Salsa DVD (Let's Go to the Nightclub: Salsa For Beginners) witch is a bad copy (black and white) of the original one!
4,Legend Of Siamese Cats,"In the centuries of interface with Thai cats and their origins, this is the first important work that brings the ancient Siam love of cats to the modern world. This book is a responsible and throughly academic account of Thai Cat breeds from ancient manuscripts. Bravo Martin!"
1,Compaq Presario V2615US,"The screen and features on the computer are wonderful, but it quit working after 6 weeks."
4,Sony SLV-N50 Stereo VCR-SLVN50,"This machine works well, it would have been helpful to have received the remote; fortunately we had an old remote that worked."
3,Wanted to like it,"I bought this book after reading ""Mary on Horseback"" to my kids and loving it. This book was such a disappointment. What a shame - because the story of how the FNS started is so interesting. The author does say that she didnt use an editor or basically get any help writing this, and it shows. I really wanted to like it. Like others have said, more stories about actual patients would've been nice."
4,watch the locks!!,"I bought this product and like it. It has taken some real beatings from the looks of the dents on it, but the skiis were not damaged in the least. It is also easy to move around in the airport."
5,SporTube Travel Ski Case,I just used the sporttube for the first time last week flying to Utah. It contained and protected my skis totally. I never worried about them for a minute. I highly recomment the sporttube to all skiers who travel with their skis.
4,Put's your worries aside,"The SporTube does what it claims. Clamps your skis and poles inside quite nicely. Long handle lets you find perfect balance spot when carried. Rolls well if not a little long as it trails behind you! How else can you keep the Airlines from wrecking your precious ski stuff and banging up your edges? The length adjust lock clip a little hard to install and it should be permanently tied to the Tube so it doesn't 'vanish'. Otherwise, it's great."
4,Baggage handlers can still break your skis in this bag,"On a recent Continental flight from CLE to PHX, I arrived to find the end of my sportube smashed in about 2 inches. Inside, the corresponding tail of my Volkl ski had been snapped about 6 inches from its end...My point... This box is good but lacks padding to protect the ends of the skis. I have now added this for future trips.A $900 lesson on new skis with 4 days of use. Continental so far denies any liability.Also, when you pack you skis, make sure that everything is strapped together including poles so everything in the bag can be removed as a unit .... do no assume that TSA is going to be careful if they open your bag."
4,peter frampton frampton,"Show me the way, Baby I love you way, two explosions in the music of Frampton, in their originals studio versions. Recommended for those who only know the versions of Frampton Comes Alive. I recommend it. Greats beginnings of a great musician."
5,I Love Milly Molly Mandy Stories,My name is Laura. I am 9 years old. I read this book that was printed a long time ago. I really like the book because Milicent Margaret Amanda did very interesting things. One of the things she did was sending messages throughout the town by running around town and passing on messages. Her grandmother taught her to sew and she made a surprise pot warmer for the tea kettle. Even though this book was written 75 years ago it is still one my favorite books. I recommend this book to children who can read or their parents can read it to them.
1,Recruiting tool for MLM company. A lot of HYPE!,"This book tries to recruit people into Nutrition for Life, which has a stairstep breakaway program. It is a hard program for the part-timer and few people have the time or energy to do this business on a full-time basis. They know that the business has been flat and looking for new prospects. Save your money on this turkey!"
5,Insprirational!,"I have a hard time understanding the negative reviews for this book. Either they haven't read it,or have no ability to feel good about anything. Whether or not you are positive about network marketing or not,you can't come away from reading this without feeling inspired to do good in your life, despite all set backs. How can that be bad? I judge people and books after taking a good look, not before. What we need is more Dayle Maloneys in this negative world of ours to give us hope to keep trying, regardless of what people say or do."
4,Italian-easy Go,"If you want a quick and easy way to learn a few dozen phrases, this is the way. The CD is broken down into several segments that can be reviewed over and over until it sinks in. The cost is cheap. It helps if the listener has some knowledge of other romance languages to aid in the pronunciation and to pick up on the similarity."
1,This mosquito repeller is for the birds.,Didn't do a thing to repel the little blood suckers as far as I can tell.
1,Very confusing Biography indeed.,"I am still terribly confused. I wondered if this biography was even authorized, but John Malkovich was in it, so it must have been. That makes me worry it was autobiographical, he seemed so lucid and sane in other movies. Also, the building with a floor at half height, what building inspector signed off on that? Talk about a fire hazard. The thing could not have been structurally sound. I am just glad no actors got hurt filming in that strange building. There are a lot of good reviews though, so maybe I am missing something."
1,Being John Malkovich,"This movie initially demonstrates a great deal of promise. I was very excited to see it, I had heard great things about the movie's creative premise. This is a great movie for people who aren't offended by husbands locking up their wives while they go to pursue other women. I believe John Cusak's character locks his wife up in an animal cage (twice) and binds her up with duct tape. Another distinctive memory is the creative puppeteer making lewd public display (on a sidewalk) of lust between a nun and a priest. I guess it's not for the religiously sensitive either. As an aside, the wife eventully ""comes around"" and begins to lust after the same woman as her husband. I'm sure I'm leaving out a lot of details from this dark, morally stunted movie. However, it's been a long time since I've seen it and I will NOT be exposing my mind to this movie again."
1,Very stupid movie,After the 2nd scene the movie start boring. The only normal person and really a good actor is John Malkovich itself. All scenario and stuff are incredible tastless.
3,Ummmm... am I missing something?,"Well it certainly was original. I've never seen any movie even remotely similar to this, so if your in the mood for an extremely surreal movie, this could be good. However it seemed like the whole movie was just being wacky for the sake of being wacky at times. For instance, what was the point of that whole half floor thing at the beginning? Was there some sort of symbolism, or was that just plain weird? I don't want to give away too much of what happens for anyone who hasn't seen it, but it seems to that there were a lot of nonsequitors throughout the movie. Maybe it was just too ""deep"" for me and all the different plot elements were somehow thematically and symbolically unified, but i don't think so.It certainly was entertaining at times, but i know that when the movie was over, the question in my mind was: what exactly was that movie about?"
4,"Excellent, but why the animals","I thought I wouldn't like this movie, but instead I found it thoroughly enjoyable, and better yet, one of the few ORIGINAL movies of the past few years. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is because of its use of caged animals. I found this unnverving, disturbing, cruel, and unnecessary. Otherwise, it was excellent entertainment."
5,Can Cusack make a bad movie?,"It seems that one of the few sure things in movies is John Cusack. And he does it again. While mind switching and occupation may not be the freshest idea out there, the direction this movie goes is so original it's scary. But it works. Both disturbing and entertaining, this movie succeeds on so many levels.First, the bizarre rules. Cusack lives in a bizarre world populated with bizarre people that drive the story along. He is subjected to the absurd until he finds a way to escape. I don't want to say much else, because it might ruin the movie. Suffice to say that there is a way to be in John Malkovich's mind, but to do so you must end up along side of the New Jersey Turnpike.In the tradition of Twelve Monkeys, Brazil, and any other journeys into the bizarre, Being John Malkovich is very entertaining and not a little disturbing."
3,"Me, Myself and I . . .","The saddest part of this movie was that it had so much potential. The first half was terrific: it appeared as if I was going to explore what it really meant to be ""me."" It was great watching Malcovich go into his own head and seeing only a world of ""Malcovich, Malcovich, . . . .""In the second half, it was almost as if the original story was changed so that it would appeal to the masses. It seemed to leave the idea of who we really are, and seemed to fall into a slapstick lesbian who-really-gives-a-rat's-a.. farce. Maybe this is what viewers want; maybe not.This movie could have been up there with ""A Clockwork Orange,"" even better than the overrated ""Brazil."" Too bad it wasn't."
2,Am I missing something,"This film was not funny at all ,it also really was just a bunch of sci-fi bs no real meaning.Also why John Malkovich what was Joe Piscopo on vacation?"
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"Not horrible, Truly original, But BORING... I was very excited to see this film and wanted to like it, But it was so BORING. I usually like John Cusack and Cameron Diaz, And like them I did. BORING. Did I mention the film was BORING. Definatly not the best of 1999. Maybe I was expecting to much. Different it was Entertaing sometimes, But always BORING"
4,Odd and Funny,"I reallylike unusual films that you can't make much sense of them like Brazilor Fight Club and Being John Malkovich is right up there, it's abouta puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack) and his obsession for his partnerMaxine (Cathrine Keener) who doesn't really like him much, her waysof making him feel like 2 cents are hilarious. Well it's not all aboutthat, did I mention Craig finds a doorway to John Malkovich's headthat allows you to be John Malkovich and that him and Maxine startcharging people that wanna try it. Oh yeah and Maxine is in love withCraig's wife, well when she's in Malkovich. The result is a wacky, funny and very originalfilm with unusual charactors. A really good start for Spike Jonze,he should have a great career behind him if he makes more films asoriginal as this."
2,It had its moments,"Ok.. I didn't enjoy this film. May be I do not have an appreciation for ""creative"" edges, maybe I was tired at the time and I need to watch it again. It just reminded me of fiction books I use to read when I was 8 (With the exception of the Adult content). But in all seriousness, I think the ""originality"" angle is severely overhyped. Its original... BIG DEAL, its boring!!"
3,Very creative,"A very creative, original movie with some excellent dark comedy. However it's creativity is also it's downfall as the originality puts limitations on how good and respected this movie can be considered."
4,Beyond Weird,"I love weird movies. But I was never ready for this one!What a strange, inventive, strange, original, strange, humorous, strange, and wonderful film!You will LOVE ""Being John Malkovich"" UNLESS: you don't like strange films.It somewhat overwhelmed me because it was so weird. After seeing it, I too felt like I went through a portal. But that ""weird"" feeling I got after seeing it isn't a bad thing-- not many films can make you feel like a completely different person right after seeing it.The DVD is weird. I wish they had a REAL interview with Spike Jonze, and a commentary track or featurette would be nice. But there are enough bizarre things on it to entertain you for awhile. One thing I must mention is this movie had terrible commercials... go check them out, and you can see why many people weren't interested in seeing the film.A strange landmark film that should be owned by anyone who enjoys bizarre movies."
2,Can't hate it but don't love it either,"In the end, what was the point? The movie started good, good cast, good premise, but then towards the middle, the movie started to sway from an existential exercise to some science fiction routine about vessels that live forever.In the end, I felt the movie didn't know how to tie it all up. It was torn between the surreal existential statement and a sci fi ending. The sci fi ending didn't meet the expectations built up, neither did it do anything for me.Sorry to say, but I didn't see the qualities that gave the film all those oscar recommendations."
3,I had to watch it at least once...,"Being John Malkovich is... an interesting film. I'll give it that. The premise is very intriguing. Once I heard about the movie, I had to see what they did with it. And I wish they had done more.The 3 stars I gave this movie are all for originality and the potential to inspire some really great movies. I really like the premise and a couple of the scenes are hilarious... but the psychological overtones are a little too much. They distract from the overall originality, and besically lower the enjoyability of the film.I'm all about this level of originality and making new rules for the ""movie world"" to live by, but I have no desire to watch dementia.This is worth a viewing if you're really into seeing something completely different, and I doubt we'll see many films like this around, but just don't expect the be all and end all of movies in this one."
5,Bizarre DVD Features,"I bought this ""Special Edition"" DVD, expecting the ""Interview With Director Spike Jonze"" feature to give me many new insights into the making of this amazingly unique film. No such luck. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so let's just say that this short segment is totally consistent with the bizarre tone of the film. You've been warned....!"
4,Strange Movie Indeed,"The first time I saw this movie I did not like it at all because I really had no idea what was going on or what was the point of the movie. After subsequent viewings I still am kind of lost but I just accept that and I cannot stop laughing when I see this movie, it does hold my attention. So even though I'm still not sure of the point of the movie I find it very entertaining in a strange way because it just cracks me up and in today's times I need and appreciate a good laugh!!!"
5,"Being John Malkovich is being damn good, & weird as hell!","I won't say much, suffice it to say that this movie really really stretches the boundaries of reality & makes your brain do a few back-flips before finally settling in and trying to make sense of what is actually going on in this film! Keep an open mind & marvel at how unattractive Cameron Diaz is portrayed here. This film is a wonderful introduction into the amazingly out-there writing style of Charlie Kaufman, who reached an even better level with his Oscar nominated film Adaptation last year...definitely give this at least one viewing.. you're probably need more considering it takes a while to understand... but it's well worth it."
5,Be someone else.,"This movie, as you've read, is off-the-wall, yet it manages to ask key questions about the nature of identity. It's funny, constantly manic yet always interesting.Catherine Keener deserved her Oscar nomination, playing Maxine as this vicious shrew who managed to find and find herself deserving of love. Nearly unrecognizable under a giant, frizzy wig, ministering to animals while trying to come to terms with realizing she's a man in a woman's body, Cameron Diaz gives the best performance of her career. And the switch given to John Cusack's character, from sad-sack hero to villain, proves his range. And Malkovich as Malkovich is superb.Visually, it's stunning, as well. The puppet show scenes, occasionally hysterical, are just plain neat. And the scene where Malkovich enters his own portal is a particular highlight.This was the best film of 1999."
2,Blech!,"The only reason I give the movie 2 stars is for originality. But at what price? The characters are completely unlikable. The plot is much smaller than I had hoped. And let's face it, it was just plain stupid. Blech."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Praised by critics, who (rightfully, to a degree) salute anything different--and boy is this movie different--Being John Malkovich is largely different for its own sake, eschewing any factors that would make the movie likable in favor of being off the wall."
2,at least i got to see orson bean,"im not sure why i gave this a second star; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman (the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious ""adaptation""), this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer (john cusack) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz."
2,A Bit of a Disappointment,"I thought this was going to be good, but I was wrong. I like John Cusack and I like the whole idea, so I really had high hopes. It really wasn't that bad, for the first half anyway. While it dealt with the implications of getting in someone's head and Cusack's character's growing dependence on it, it was funny and interesting. Unfortunately it turns into a sappy, feminist struggle for true love. Hey, I know the lesbian implications in it, and I appriciate them as much as anyone, but not in this movie. It's kind of like ""Chasing Amy,"" good for the forst half, but the ending is so rediculous, it's just sad. It's just a disappointment, don't bother."
1,"Uncomfortable, unpleasant experience","I'm a fan of John Malkovich and when I heard that he was going to be in the movie that bore his name I had to see it. Aside from a couple of parts where Malkovich is actually on screen (""Malkovich, Malkovich"" and the Charlie Sheen cameo), this movie is dreary, unsettling, and for the most part pure trash. Not creative trash, mind you, gratutious ""let's push the envelope and impose our own sick fantasies on the public"" trash. This movie has nothing much to say aside from wasting our time showing how a pack of not-so-nice low life people sink even lower while engaging in sick sexual fantasies and backstabbing each other. It wasn't entertaining nor thought-provoking, just provoking; a dismal and self-involved effort that wastes a couple of hours of your life when you could be doing something much better than fill your mind with this trash. I didn't even watch it to the end. Two-thirds of the way through was all I could stomach."
1,Just Plain Being Dumb!,"This film is in my all time top 5 for the WORST movies that I've ever seen. I turned it off halfway through after repeating to myself over and over that this is dumb. I wish I could get my money back for the rental, it was that bad. I don't usually post negagive reviews, but this film in my opinion was just plain stupid and not worth the time that I spent watching the little that I did. Avoid it at all costs.W.Harrison"
1,Pretentious doesn't mean good.,"I like a lot of movies. This movie was truly different. Different is not always good. I owned this movie for two days, then traded it at the used DVD shop for something better. What a waste of John Cusak's talent."
1,Overated!,"Ok. The premise is interesting. That's the reason I watched this movie in the first place. However, the execution leaves a whole lot to be desired. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who still wants to see it, but I will say that I was surprised at how poorly some of the actors acted in this movie, especially Cameron Diaz. The movie also takes far too long to get anywhere and when it does, you're left wondering how much better this movie could have been with a stronger script. I know that Roger Ebert said this was the best movie of 1999 (it says so right on the box), but he really missed the boat on this one."
1,worst movie ever!,"I'm not a movie hater, but this movie had to be the worst movie ever made. As other reviewers have said, the idea/plot for this movie was totally unique & interesting, but that is all the movie had to offer! The characters acted so awkwardly & completely unnatural. This movie is just too bizarre (not in a good way)...don't throw your money away, rent it first before you buy it."
5,this movie is heart-breakingly beautiful.,"the title of my review says it all. i know the characters are somewhat unlikable, but isn't that how life is sometimes? their circumstances are obviously surreal, but their reactions are totally believable. this movie has magic. i wish i could see it again for the first time... carter burwell's themes are some of the most beautiful pieces of movie music i've heard in a long time... the direction is perfectly unobtrusive (that's actually good sometimes!) The whole thing reminds me of one of my favorite director's work: terry gilliam... see it. see it twice. buy it, if you must. it's a portal to another dimension... hang on!"
3,Very Creative Screenplay Eventually Succumbs to Over-reach,"BEING JOHN MALKOVICH * * 1/2 A tough one to rate. The screenplay is extremely creative but to me it tries to hard to cover too much ground, too many themes. As entertainment, the first half hour is the funniest stuff I've seen in a movie in a long time, but then the unpleasantness of the characters started getting to me and by the end I had to consider it an admirable misfire. John Cusack is excellent."
4,Weird,"Strange movie. John Malkovich is why I liked it. I find him strange in any movie that he is in. Even more so in this one especially when he is inside himself and all around him there he is. I laughed when he was singing, dressed as a female laying across the piano."
5,"A Great Movie, A Great DVD","This movie was great, but the DVD is even better. From the minute I opened up the packaging, I was surprised. Somehow, they came up with a way to compress a t-shirt and a Malkovich mask to fit inside the DVD case with the DVD. Aside from that, the dvd itself was great. It had many extra features, including an interview with the director, a 45 minute behind the scenes featurette, a link to a special website, 2 different Director's Commentaries (one in Spike Jonze's Original Swedish), an interactive game with puppets and much more. I would strongly reccommend this dvd even if it didn't have that stuff on it."
5,I liked it a lot,"Everything about this movie was great, the cast, plot, tone...etc. The all-start cast consisted of John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener. The main character, Cusack, is a struggling puppeteer married to Diaz, a pet-obsessed woman with frizzy hair. One day, Cusack takes a job as a filer in a bazaar firm that is on only half of a floor, and he discovers a portal into actor, John Malcovich's, brain. All the while, Cusack has been obsessed with Catherine Keener's character, Maxine, and so has Cusack's wife, Diaz. Things get confusing for everyone, Diaz thinks she's a transexual after being in Malcovich's head, Maxine is only inlove with Diaz while she is in Malcovich, and Cusack will do anything to win over Maxine including tying up his wife and leaving her in a monkey's cage. Very weird idea for a film, definately not mainstream, but I really enjoyed it. It's genius."
2,Being Bored Stiff,"Yawn. Ooh, wait. I have to say I like it because if I say I don't, people will say I don't understand it. Well, I don't."
2,"umm...well it was definitly weird, I'll say that for it","This was a VERY strange movie. It started out alright...though John Cusak and his puppets was weird..and Cameron Diaz and her animals was even weirder. I will say that the movie was interesting and had a plot that kept me hooked--at least for a little. The thing that got to me was that one character was having sex with John Malkovich WHILE Diaz was inside MAlkovich and the character (Maxine) and Diaz both new it and were doing this to have sex with each other....gross. No offense to gays out there, but I think that ""gay"" sex did not need to be in that movie, because it really could have been good without it."
1,"""Painful""","From the opening credits this movie is a horror to watch. There is nothing of value here, if you order it, hope it gets lost in the mail, run don't walk to avoid this stinker, I suspect it was released in 1999 to avoid getting a jump as the worst move of the 21st century. The critics review on this must be some kind of weird joke, can they prove that people will go see crummy movies if they get good reviews? Something really stinks here and it is this movie, save your money and move up in class by ordering the ""Gong show movie"" instead, a distant second to this as worst in the 1900's."
1,Stupid plot and proding story,"Waste of time. This is not good SciFi, it is explotation. I presume everyone involved had some very long arms to pat themselves on the back for getting paid for this. Yuck!"
1,Being John Malkovich,This movie really made me think about what it would be like to be someone else. The whole time I just kept wishing I could be someone who WASN'T watching Being John Malkovich.
5,strange and fantastic,"as always cameron diaz is the best, she plays wonderfully. Even though she plays an unsexy animal fanatic( but not with the penguins, thank godness), she's stunnig. The story is a little strange, but it's captivating.Buy this dvd, hear it in german, it's funny!!!"
3,pretty good,This was an okay film. But the critics who raved about it confused it being different with it being brilliant. It WAS imaginitive...but so is your average comic book. But it was still an entertaining movie.
3,Did not enjoy this movie,"A bit to weird and out of character for all the actors that played in it. I think it was a break away from their usually ""GOOD"" performances.The premise of the movie was OKAY from a totally creative standpoint. I mean, I can't imagine it being a book...so a movie is what it would have to be.The portal thing was OLD the twist were bizarre and the outcome plan old WEIRD.Just a bit to dark for my taste"
3,Intresting Flick.....,"This movie is very,very original! It's not utterlyhilarious too often but theabsurdity of the characters and their situations kept mesmirking from beginning to end! I'm wondering if Johnwould lease a few days of hislife to me? All in all a verysolid comedy."
3,"Well, ok but?","I was told by a lot of people to go see this movie, maybe it was built up too much but I was not impressed. The film as the review above said is ""original"" but little else. I'm not sure why it is classed as a comedy, dramedy would be a far better description. I was truly expecting this film to be on a level with the other Cusak films, which ,perhaps refreshingly to some, it is not. The film is rather pointless and confusing. When I saw it in the theater about half way through people started getting up and leaving, and to be honest I wish I had too. By the end I was dosing in my seat. This is more or less an art film, and will not hold much to people who are intrested in pure entertainment."
2,Spend your time elsewhere.,Adultery and foul language. And just weird. Spend time elsewhere. Turned the movie off in 30 minutes.
1,I thought the movie was terrible,"I disagree with the consensus, and think this was one of the worst movies I've seen this year. I had high expectations for this movie since the advertising on the box says it was nominated for 3 academy awards, and Roger Ebert said ""best movie of the year!""I found the story original, but sort of silly. The floor 7 1/2 joke gets sort of old, and super-babe Cameron Diaz looks horrible in this movie (I was expecting something better to look at). John Malkovich, himself, is also a very boring personality. The whole movie was very unfunny, and quite unentertaining -- I just don't get what people find so great."
2,Muddled and confusing.,"OK, I understand the message behind this film, that we're all obsessed with celebrity and that we should be happy with who we are, But this film was too weird and misleading to me. John Cusack's character is a struggling puppet master and Cameron Diaz is his sexually confused wife. But why John Malkovich's body? He's not that big of a star. And how Catherine Keener got an Oscar nomination is beyond me. I couldn't understand how the old man got into Malkovich's body or the scene in his subconscious. The only reason for my two stars is the message."
2,Why Deranged Writers Should be Supervised,"This movie is a perfect example of how you shouldn't take drugs before writing scripts. The first part was amusing but bizarre; the second half ruined the first half by introducing sexual perversion. If you are going to take drugs and write scripts, please use the SAME drug and don't mix them randomly.This could have been a great movie, and there are some good spots, but essentially it's a waste of time. Get something better, like Amazon Women from Mars."
1,Waste of Time and Money,This movie was really messed up and hard to follow. Don't waste your time watching it.
2,Ugh!!,"I adore John Malkovich. I havent missed any of his movies. Intelligent, super suave, extraordinarily attractive, a true gentleman (or so he seems), superior actor. How could he allow even his name to appear in this so-called movie? How could he allow to be represented in such a manner? Was he really in such a need of money that he accepted this shameful parody of himself? I could not believe my eyes when I watched this...., I do not know what to call it: it is not a movie, it is a farce and an insult to the intelligence of any living person. Ugh, and ugh and ugh!!! Pure trash."

2,icky,"I didnt like this movie. All the characters were wretched, except for malkovich, whom I felt sorry for. Although there were a few comedic spots (the half floor, charlie sheen) over all, I found this movie to be depressing and sad. The whole time I was watching this, I couldn't help but wonder why I would want to spend 2 hours with any of these people."
5,NOT a shallow meaningless comedy !,"I must protest the editorial review that stated, ""Does it add up to much? Not really."" The writer of this review needs to take another look. At first glance many things may seem like random nonsense such as the low cielings and all the animals and the ""Malcovich Malcovich"" scene. But if you look again you will see that these and many many other things are symbolic and many have reference to other parts of the film and to deeper meanings. And the best part is that it manages to be funny at the same time. In my opinion this is easily one of the most ingenious movies ever made."
5,Dark yet Funny!!,"My favorite scene in Being John Malkovich is when JM himself goes into the portal...and the restaurant is filled with all different JM's. I was wondering as he was going down the tube what he was going to find by going into his portal. I will not ruin it for you. Watch this movie, if only for this scene!"
4,Differant is good,"A strange world awaits in this movie. It is a fresh and funny. It pushs actors John Cuasack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich to act in a more indepth way. I did not even reconize Cameron Diaz and John Cuasack was not his usual fast talking character. A delight to watch."
2,"This film is...is...well, not good","I'd give this film one - yes, one! - star if not for the engaging and imaginative first half hour. After that, it's all downhill. A promising beginning that had my full attention dissolves into an unfunny mess, and it's painful to watch it happen. You can sense the movie is just not going to take off, and guess what? It doesn't. In the portal. Out of the portal. In the portal. Out of the portal. Dopey characters that were more like cartoons than real flesh and blood people. A plot that might have sounded good on paper but on celluloid failed miserably to hold my interest. Plus, a script that thought it was far more clever than it actually was.My own mother said I had to see this preposterous nonsense. Shows you what she knows."
3,Would You Like To Be Someone Else? Now you Can. . .,For me it was niether spellbinding nor thrilling (until the end) but it was probbaly the most original most inventive film of the year. The fact that a puppeteer found a portal in his work office that leads to John Malkovich's head is just fun. There were some funny segments in the film but nothing to make me burst out like I wanted too. If you're looking for a film that's just pure entertainment then Being John Malkovich is for you.
4,So Refreshing,"I am amazed at how clean that Kaufmans films are. I mean they are really some very convuluted and jigsawed films...that consistently are flawless and so very, very watchable. I love this movie. Its so smart, so creative and yes, so original.They performances are EXCELLENT, the music perfect and the direction delicate and precise. Just a wonderful film that most have seen, but for those that have yet to, do yourself a favor and check it out. It was like nothing I imagined and took me on a ride through the obscure I rarely like, but in this case fell in Love.A great film, matching all the componets for a near perfect experience."
