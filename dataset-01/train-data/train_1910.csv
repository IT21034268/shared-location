3,Was good,This radio was good when it worked. the speaker would work when it wanted to and the display stopped working in less than 30 days. the range was more than expected it could hear real well. returned the radio for a refund and decided to go with a more higher end radio Galaxy DX-979.
2,not what I expected,"Not as good as my old radio shack model which is 10 years old. This unit isn't as strong on receiving,even with a new antenna.It also picked up ignition noise.The squelch had to be set to low noise just to get any reception at all. The weather alert was also weak. I sent it back and am using the old radio shack model."
4,Good CB,"This CB has the NOAA weather bands on it and almost anywhere in the country, you will be able to pick up the local weather on one of the three channels. The squelch and RF gain dial allow you to tune out weak or staticy signals that interfere with what you do want to listen to or talk with.A good value, all in all, and (I am told) they are made with the same circuitry that Cobras are made with for much less money."
3,"Seems solid, but will not fit a flute with a C# trill key option","I was satisfied with the general construction, look, and heft of the saddle. However, it would not fit on my flute because I have a C# trill key option, and the large C# vent hole will not accommodate the saddle.I also purchased the thumb rest to experiment with. So far, results are favorable. If you don't have a C# trill key on your flute (most student models and intermediate models don't come with this option, and even pro flutes generally have to have the option ordered as an add-on), I'd give it a shot. It's a relatively inexpensive way to increase comfort. And if it doesn't work for you, it's a fairly cheap experiment. Low risk, high potential for reward.I've heard from some users that these Bo Pep finger rests and saddles would scratch the body of the flute, but the plastic finishing on the product does not seem inclined to scratch my flute so long as the rest is applied carefully (don't just SNAP it on, be gentle)."
2,Doesn't Quite Cut It,"I went for the 2.4ghz model by Uniden because I have their 900mhz DSS phone and it's great. However, the 2.4ghz model is a terrible disappointment and a shame for Uniden. What a disgrace. They should hang their heads in shame for releasing this one.1. The range is terrible. I can't get 10 feet out my door without enormous static and clicking noises until the connection finally drops. I have tried relocating the phone, and it's no better. I also put it in the EXACT place where my 900mhz phone was, and no better either.2. There is an echo. Not the kind of echo as in a delayed sound, but you hear yourself back through the headset, and it's somewhat annoying.3. Party on the other end compared it to my 900mhz phone, and said the 900mhz was much clearer.Sorry Uniden. If I'm going to pay $100 for a phone, it's going to at least be clear and get me around the block.Try again. I'm looking for another brand now."
1,beware,"headset does not fit ear comfortably, something i never noticed or thought of with a phone until this....keys stuck with first handset and had it replaced and now keys stick (6 months later) with new one.....did not do anything to cause it....battery died and must replace after less than a year....sound quality poor...must be a better product somewhere...."
1,"900 DSS Unidens are good, this phone is disgraceful.","I bought this phone after being very very impressed with the 900 Mhz DSS Uniden phone I had. It did not have caller ID, but had a base with a slot for a second battery (I sorely miss that).That phone would go 100 yards in my condo complex and not lose the connection. I now can't even go to the end of my driveway (50 feet) without the phone kicking out.AND the microwave will disconnect you. What a piece of (...) this phone is. Just after they get my business from Panasonic they destroy their reputation.DO NOT BUY!!"
1,bad voice quality,"I purchased this phone because of my experience with a uniden 900 mhz phone. The 2.4 had echo's and bad voice quality. I was outside 1 time, and with background noise, could hardly hear because of the echo. My wife said to return it, which I did. I still want a 2.4 phone, but will read more reviews."
3,I was expecting more from this phone,"I recently purchased the Uniden TRU248 2.4 GHz DSS Cordless Phone. Before reading the other reviews on this site, I thought the problems with my phone may have been caused by things beside the phone. I thought it may be that the recent snow storms or the towers a few miles away were affecting my phone's reception. Calls are hard to hear and callers have a hard time hearing me. I have tried changing channels and that does not change things at all. I have a 900mhz portable phone (not a Uniden) that gets excellent reception even with the recent storms and nearby towers. I will be returning my Uniden TRU248 2.4 GHz phone for another brand."
4,good phone,I had this phone for many years. We never had a problem until lately. The buttons only worked if you pushed them a couple time and really hard. But like I said it has been many years and you can't expect electronics to work forever. I have ordered another uniden phone due to how happy this phone made us.
2,"If you're looking for deep plot, this is not the book","The book starts out well, the action starting on page one with the main characters, a husband and wife, finding a body behind their beach home. As the plot unfolds it looses readers, no action until the second murder that tends to seem unrealistic. The end is no particular surprise and reader goes away feeling unsatisfied. Nice book to read in a weekend, if you don't feel like getting into anything heavy."
5,Great for Beginners!,"This is a great video for someone who wants to do step at home. It uses limited floor space,and is a nice combination of simple moves that will keep you moving. If you are new at step, the instructions couldn't be more simple. Furthermore, the camara work makes it feel like Becky is right in your living room with you. She neither yells nor gushes her instructions, and the extras are refreshingly silent, so you can concentrate on her instructions. She is real, with no plastered smile on her face. And, you have propulsion moves, as well as a lot of good stepping. There's abs, arms and leg toning afterward. After years of stepping, this is still my favorite step video for a complete body workout, and the music is really refreshing. I recommend it highly, and my friends who have seen it bought it, and began stepping too."
4,Granddaughter loves whoozit,I purchased this for my 3 month old granddaughter and she just smiled and laughed as soon as she saw it. It makes many noises too. The design and colors are very interesting and bold they hold her attention for awhile. Very happy with this buy.
5,Baby's Favorite,"This toy looks strange, but it has become our daughter's favorite. She lights up every time she discovers it! Lots of colorful things to chew on (especially the squeeky nose), which is great for teething babies. And when it gets dirty, I throw it in the washing machine (but not the dryer)."
5,Bring it everywhere,"My son loves this toy. He plays with it in his car seat, jumperoo, excersaucer, and swing. He just figured out that the nose moves and can squeak, he seemed so amazed by that. I love thisso much because my son loves this so much."
5,Infant LOVES this thing!,Right now our baby is 6 weeks old and this is the only thing that holds her attention for more than a few seconds. She will stare at this toy like it's the only thing that matters in the world. We actually attatch it to the activity mat now because she doesn't pay attention to anything else hanging there. Bouncy seat? Swing? Activity mat? Rattles? Nope... just her little Whoozit. I hope it holds her attention as she grows but I'll take what I can get for now! I highly recommend this for infants!
2,watch your teether...,"My 1yr old teething daughter started pulling off bits of the purple fabric with her teeth, had to get decent size pieces out of her mouth.Your child might not be as bad as mine about doing something like that, but if so watch them! Had to put in trash when she wasn't looking... prior to that ok toy.."
3,"Nice toy, but fuzz comes off in baby's mouth","My baby did enjoy this toy, but the fuzzy red nose is poorly designed. I would have rated it much higher if the covering for the nose was made out of a different type of material. I haven't allowed my baby to play with the toy since I had to dig a gob of fuzzy red substance from the back of his mouth after he bit the nose. This was a great toy until he got teeth."
4,good,It's a nice bright toy for the newborns. Great for experiencing different shapes and surfaces. My nephew absolutely loved it!
1,?????,"After reading the other reviews, I have decided that I must have bought this for my daughter at the wrong age. I bought it when she was 6 months old and she has never cared much for it. I guess I will try with my next child."
1,Caution with this toy and an infant and older child,"I thought this was going to be the best baby toy we had. It had such wonderful reviews and had been featured on several of the Baby Einstein videos. Actually, that is why my son (then 2) chose it for a gift for his baby sister's arrival.It was larger than I expected, but was still encouraged by all of the bright colors and assortment of tactile surfaces. The size ended up being the problem. My son gave it to the baby while she was on her mat a few feet away from me and almost smothered her with it!!!!! The toy COMPLETELY covered her face and is very plush so definitely could have obstructed her breathing. Even if my son wasn't holding it for her, she could have still dropped it on her face and then not have been able to get it off again.I do NOT recommend this toy for children that are not old enough to have good control of their arms and cannot move a toy off of themselves."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this toy for my first daughter when she was an infant because it had such great reviews. I was very disappointed when she paid it no attention at all! She never played with it, not once. It was a very big waste of money, we ended up giving it away to a pregnant friend, maybe her baby would like it. All in all, I was not impressed."
3,Whoozit review,"When my daughter was four months I bought her the baby whoozit and the full size whoozit because of all of the positive reviews. It's been two months and I'm kind of sad to say that at best she is kept somewhat occupied in the car with the baby whoozit (she likes to suck on the pink doughnuts) and at worst she is completely indifferent to the full size whoozit. I was hoping she would immediately love the toys so I could get about twenty minutes without having to entertain her, but I guess it's not meant to be. Also, one of the stars on the full size whoozit is about to come off despite hardly being played with at all. The baby whoozit is holding up nicely though, even after a washing. They aren't bad products, it's just that my girl doesn't like them all that much. All in all I would buy the baby whoozit again (it's a great size to keep in the car) but save my money on the larger size."
5,First favorite,"I bought this toy at a store when I was showing my 3 month old daughter different toys and this was the one she reacted to! Two months later she still loves her ""whozeewhatsit"" (what dad and I call it) - it is the only toy we need to bring with us and she loves chewing on the round pink ones."
4,Czechoslovak Fairy Tales,"I love this book! My family had an old torn, falling apart copy that says it was published in 1911! I have read all these stories a thousand times and never gotten tired of them. It occurred to me that I might purchase another copy but alas, they aren't publishing it any more. The stories in it are very Eastern European, which of couse I didn't know until I was older. The flavor of the stories is just enough different from the more traditional ones that we're familiar with that they have an exotic feel. I still wonder what a ducat is! If you ever get a chance to read this book don't pass it up!"
1,Wragh,"I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free, though..."
4,Great tales from a great culture,"Great stories for those interested in the culture or herritage, but I feel like the flow is more of a direct translation than free flowing stories. This makes the stories a little awkward to read, but still good morals."
3,"A good game, not great but worth 10bux or less.",I have enjoyed this game but think it would be a little bit tough for kids under 12. Definitely worth 10bux or less.
1,Game froze,"Item was stratched and only worked to a certain point and then froze, which was very disappointing. The game also has numerous glitches, where items are not there, but are. Not sure if this is from the scratch or the game program itself."
5,If you like musketeer movies this a great one!,"For those, musketeer movies, you will enjoy this one, drama, action at the end, just almost unexpected end."
4,On Guard,"I'm a fan of french movies,I think Daniel Auteil is a very good actor and seeing him is enjoyable.The story is interesting.I love fencing and french people are very good in that sport.Thankyou, Alejandra"
5,Great kit to build with good details.,I bought this kit when it was first releaased during the 1990s. This kit is about the size of the Neca and McFarline figures and has about the same articulation. This kit looks great built and comes with the Plasma Rifle seen in the Terminator future sequences in the movies. I would recommend this kit to any Terminator fan.
2,To many references and not enough data,"Although it is a class requirement to read this book, it leaves a lot to the imagination for those who are unfamilar with Flight Simulators. Too many references about....not enough data, need more testing....these comments are made from reports within the book written in the 1960's, 1970's, one would think that data exists somewhere, like the internet."
5,Zoo Diaries,"This series is truely great! It has drama, entertainment, and lots of story to go with each episode of this series. Plus, you can get it for a cheap and affordable price as well!!!So if you want a good series to watch...then Zoo Diaries Season One is just for you! Buy it and enjoy! :)"
5,Daybreak 2250 A.D.,"I read this book in Junior High 25 years ago. Like many teenagers, I identified with the main character Fors. Alienated and rejected by his peers and community, he overcame adversity and succeeded. He was an outcast, but that isolation sharpened his strength, courage, intelligence and will to survive. Yes, Fors adventures piqued my interest. He was a fictional hero that I could identify with. Perhaps, in a small way this book helped me and I suppose many other ""uncool"" kids find the confidence to believe in ourselves and develop our own inner strength. Indeed, cleanly and simply written,this book reads as well today as it did all those years ago. I highly recommend it. In my opinion, Ms. Norton's best work."
3,Fantastic music pity about the homophobia,"This DVD contains some fantastic performances particulary from Buju Banton, Turbulence and Anthony B that is at times awe inspiring and makes you realise how great this music is but it is let down by the usual boring and pathetic obsession with Homosexuality that is so damaging to this great music.Why, when there is so much trouble in the world and people are dying from Aids (and Credit to Turbulence for the condom references), poverty and war do the new breed of Cultural Singers focus so much attention on such a non-issue which so few people (outside of Jamaica) see as a problem. How is spouting off about Homosexuality helping the youth. Or is Homesexuality to blame for the poverty and gun culture wrecking Kingston?A pity because Jamaica is producing so many talented singers at the moment and this prevents exposure to a wider audienceHaving said all that I still recommend the DVD for the music."
3,"Where is ""Driving Home For Christmas""?","A fantastic list of songs but it's missing a very crucial track, Driving Home For Christmas. And because of that I won't be buying this CD. Does anyone know why this song is not on this CD?I would have rated this 4 stars if it had that classic Christmas song ""Driving Home For Christmas"", but sadly it doesn't."
3,Re-Recorded Songs - Only for new fans,"Chris Rea is/was huge in Europe. Great albums like ""Shamrock Diaries"" and ""On the Beach"" marked the mid 80's for a lot of people. Therefore it hurts to see Rea rerecording 80's classics like ""Josephine"" , ""On the Beach"" and ""I can hear your heartbeat"". Also great songs/hits like ""All Summer Long"" and ""It's all Gone"" are not included here (and a mediocre duet with Elton John is)I guess if you're new to Rea you've never heard the classic originals so you won't mind. The quality of Rea's work comes through anyway, but if you get a chance get a copy of one of his classic albums of the 80s"
2,NOT the best of...,"I sure Am a big Chris Rea fan. But I have to say that the best is not on the album. How about songs like 1.Curse of the traveller 2.Loving you again 3.September blue 3.Windy town, did Rod Steward have to see its a good song! 4.Giverny 5.Lucky day 6.It's all gone 7. Hello friend 8. All summer long 9. Love turns to lies 10. Since I don't see you anymore 11.Daytona 12.I just wanna be with you 13. Soft top, Hard shoulder 14. Too much pride 15. You must be evil and... Now wait a minute - there must be the best of Part2 coming or what! Smart guy..."
2,This is NOT the old 'Best of' - It's the new 'Best of'.,"If you're looking for the hits as they were originally recorded, this is NOT it. These are remakes from the original artist. His voice has changed considerably, and not for the better."
2,Where is the original version of FOOL?,"This is an ok cd. But with a title like The Best Of Chris Rea, I assumed the album would contain his only Top Ten hit in the U.S. Boy, was I ticked when I discovered Fool (If You Think It's Over) is a re-recorded version. The original version from the late 70's is truely one of the great pop confections of that decade. I've been searching for it, even on vinyl, for the past 15 years. It deserves a home on cd!"
3,aklsdfjhsd,"I had to buy this book for a class. The material is interesting enough, but the chapters are really long and I have trouble paying attention for a long period of time. I had initially bought this book from my university's bookstore but found it for cheaper on Amazon. I would definitely recomend buying online."
2,"Great bag, terrible shipping","Baby Universe is the worst online store on the planet. I ordered this bag 4 weeks ago thru amazon, and i have yet to receive it. The customer service at baby universe is an oxymoron because all they do is give you the runaround. they have no idea what is going on, and they aren't even polite. NEVER EVER order from these people if you want your items shipped to you in a reasonable frame of time."
4,Clear Vinyl,"I used this to cover our screen porch windows and it works perfectly. I couldn't find it in any hardware stores. It came sooner than expected. A very good way to cover the removable wooden frames I made for the porch. I used a staple gun to attach it to the frames. It is strong and durable, with only a few wrinkles."
3,Thin,"Thin gloves, pretty good for moderately cold weather. Not warm enough during cold spells (say, in mid-Atlantic states)."
2,not very warm.,Look nice but not warm like I expected them to be. I have put a liner in them for warmth
5,Nice Gloves,"Very nice gloves, very warm. Only one thing they run a little big. The X-Large which I usually wear were a little big. So you might want to order a smaller size. Wash very well and no shrinkage."
5,Barbaby's casebook,great set of videos. supplier was also great. item came so quickly I was shocked at the great service.
2,midsomer murders/barnaby's casebook,"Ilove this series.The reason I chose I don't it is this set repeats what's in the individual sets i.e. Vol.1,2 and so on.It's misleading to call the DVD set the Early Cases when these same titles are in the individual sets.I actually bought this set and was disappointed when I discovered I had the same titles in my individual volume sets.Ifound that to be suspect especially since the name of the set has been changed from ""The Early Case Murder's"" to now ""Barnaby's Casebook"" SUSPECT SUSPECT SUSPECT!!!!!!!C.Underhill"
2,polio vaccine,"In a description you can find the following ""WI-38 strain, taken from aborted fetus cells used to develop a polio vaccine"". It's weird since polio vaccine was develop in 1952, and first stem cells research on human cell began mainly in ""1998: James Thomson and coworkers derive the first human embryonic stem cell line at the University of Wisconsin-Madison"". So, how is it possible that polio vaccine was develop from stem cell taken from aborted fetus if stem cell research was not done in this time period."
5,Will buy another,"This great case hangs vertically on one's belt instead of laterally (Horizontal), taking less space. Now I need another because I bought a similarly sized camera for my wife and I can't get my case back."
5,Knocked for a six!,"Just go out and buy this album, its a real double album songfest. Great lyrics, great songs and Fab arrangements. This should have been two albums, but hey, the guys must be feeling generous. Catch it while you can!!"
3,"Good, but some serious shortcomings","This is a good-looking unit and with its glass lens, it is able to produce sharper images than other webcams I've used. OK, so why just a 3-star rating? The ""RightLight Technology"" is way overrated. During the day, when the subject (me) is backlighted by a large window, my image is a silhouette. This is no better than what can be expected from a $25 webcam. The ""RightSound"" is much better. It's great to be able to have Skype conversations without first having to put on a headset. The unit effectively cancels the voice feedback.I like this webcam for the incorporated mic and the feedback fix and the glass lens, but Logitech needs to do more work on the backlighting problem."
3,nice camera but it does not work with Skype (Vista),"After six months of ownership and 2 new driver updates from Logitec and 3 new versions of Skype this camera still crashes my system when I try to use it with Skype running under Vista. The good news is that the driver updates allow the camera to function under Vista, so if you want to make videos and vlogs using the Logitec software, you are all set. The video quality is amazing."
1,Logitech Letdown,"Logitech keeps doing the same thing - they use their standard software & drivers then add some gizmo (a tripod, a robot, whatever) to make it different, but the camera is still a 640x480. Hello? Anyone at home Logitech? My laptop screen is 1920x1200 (dell 1705) - HDTV is 1920x1080 - why would you possibly STILL make a 640x480 camera?It's time for an upgrade. Logitech needs to make a multi-megapixel class camera that has ""usefull"" features (listening to the grinding motors on the robo-camera made the sound useless, for example - better gears would have fixed that)For LESS money than this, you can buy a 3 MP camera with a USB cable and a webcam function so with that available, the 640x480 is out of date.All the video cameras give logitech a worse name when they come out."
4,Affordable Webcam that Work Well!,"I needed a webcam so that my son could talk to his father while he was away and after researching and reading reviews we chose the Logitech QuickCam Ultra Vision SE. When it arrived, we hooked both webcams up on our Vista computers and installed the software without any issues. We've used them for several months 2 - 4 times a week and have had no issues. The camera eye turns so it's easily adjustable, it has a adjustable hook to hook on to the top of your computer monitor or laptop. The picture is clear, the only issue I have had is that the picture is darker than I'd like at times. It could be the room lighting or an easy adjustment in the webcam settings. Overall, I would definitely recommend this camera as it was very affordable and works well."
1,Auto Focus and Right Lite software Doesn't work for MAC,"This webcam is worthless for mac, atofocus and right light don't work so you get a shadowy figure that out of focus all the time."
3,Crisp Picture.,"I just received this webcam as a gift since my computer just stopped recognizing the camcorder I was using. It has a very crisp picture, and is easy to install. I haven't used the video effects but they look fun. It also works with MSN mesenger and yahoo messenger and others. The microphone picks up sound very well.I didn't give it 5 stars because, and this might be just because I got used to using a camcorder, there is no pan/tilt or zoom, having a 7 month old I am trying to capture, it makes it hard because the camera doesn't sit on other surfaces besides the computer screen very well."
1,BAIT & SWITCH Item for TigerDirect,"Ordered 3 from TigerDirect Seller and was sent 3 entry level Logitech QuickCams in BAIT & SWITCH order. Seller continues to list more robust featured and expensive item with picture and price of less expensive entry level item. Going through feedback of seller, this appears to be a routine practice of theirs as they were selling Apple Mac Mini's and shipping ipod Nano's to customers this weekend as well. Buyer Beware when dealing with TigerDirect"
1,"This is cheap ""quickcam for notebooks""","For $35 this looks like a great bargain. I ordered one and was sent the low-resolution quickcam for notebooks. Tigerselect claims there is ""no noticable difference""."
1,KitchenAid has dropped their quality to save cost...,"My wife has a Classic K45SS that she purchased 18 years ago. She she loves to bake and has used it for the most part daily for 18 years. She uses it to make heavy whole wheat bread. HOWEVER. As you have seen the Kitchen Aid products are not the same as they were in the late 80's. I have read many end-user reviews and without exception if you are going to use the mixer a lot and mix heavy batches. Regardless of the ratings the WORD IS; Buy a mixer other than Kitchen Aid. This is sad, They know how to do it right. They did it right in the past. Ford and GM syndrome! Make it cheap and put the ultimate cost ""Operational Cost"" on your customer. In the long run this will lead to the ""loss of a legacy""."
2,Paint came off after 3 uses,"I have the feeling that this is a refurbished mixer. The paint on the flat beater came off after 3rd time. I was only making cookies when I realized the paint has come off. The paint on the bottom of the mixer where the bowl sits also came off. Then we read the manual that you have to adjusted the ""beater to bowl clearance"". Why wasn't this pre-adjusted by the manufacture. My husband was trying to get the screw off to adjust this but couldn't. Now I am thinking returning this because paint might come off again on the beater or anywhere else on this mixer. This model was not advertised as a refurbished model when we bought it. But I think it might be because it was showing in Amazon as an used one at one point, now it's not again."
5,Bullet proof,"just bought new paddlesmy mixer is a 33 yrs old KS 55, bought brand newhas never failed, never needed workplows on even when I make a very heavy dough for gingerbread cookies"
5,Kitchen Aid,"A great product. The search, purchase and delivery were all easy, quick and as quoted. Thank you"
1,Spend the extra money and get a better KitchenAid,"According to KitchenAid, when you adjust the mixer it should come in contact with a dime at the bottom of the bowl. No chance with this one. When I went into my local kitchen store and asked them about adjusting the mixer for this they showed me how to do it. I went home excited, finally!Unfortunately, this model doesn't come with the same sort of adjustment as their better models.Spend the extra and get the better model."
1,easy lift handle does not work veyr good...,"I have purchased 3 of these mixers in the last couple of years. While I like the power they have, I would never buy another. the so called easy lift handle is prone to breakage. On all three mixers, after a couple of months, the handle is so hard to use (bowl won't budge) that I have given up on these mixers. I would suggest getting the kitchenaid with the pivoting head."
5,My wife was very impressed,I purchased this mixer from Amazon.com for an amazing price. Mostwebsites listed this mixer for $100.00 more but Amazon beat themall with this great price and free shipping. The look and qualityof this mixer is vastly superior than other mixers I've seen.My wife can't have enough of it and it looks great in our kitchencounter !
1,So disappointing!,"I've always watched the chefs on TV use their Kitchenaid mixers, so I was very excited to see one on Amazon at a great price. Unfortunately, this mixer hasen't lived up to it's heavy duty name. Even a single batch of cookie dough makes the mixer bounce all over the counter, and bread dough requires you to practically lay on top of it to keep it from bouncing to the floor. Also, the enamel on the beater and the dough hook has started to chip like crazy...can this be safe to eat???This ranks as one of the most disappointing purchases ever."
2,Put me in the not satisfied category....,"This thing is the worst of both worlds. It has all the hassles of an industrial mixer without the power.First of all, the bowl itself goes up and down instead of having a swivel head, so unless you put all the ingredients in at once, it is a pain to add ingredients. I guess removing the bowl is an option, but then you need to remove the mixing blade. Then it starts with a pretty strong kick (even when set on 1), so there is usually flour everywhere. On top of all this it really doesn't have a strong motor. I did less than a double batch of chocolate chip cookies with it, and once all the ingredients were in, it wouldn't go past speed 1. Finally, it comes with very little, and all the add ons are pretty pricey.My advise: either buy a swivel head model, or get one of the professional models with a real strong motor (450+ watts)."
4,KitchenAid Stand Mixer,"I gave it a four because once the batter was mixed and as I poured it into the pan, I noticed that the mix in the bottom center of the bowl was not mixed at all. The powder mix was still in its original form. I have a friend who mentioned that she also experienced the same with hers. Could this be a flaw with the lift?"
5,I Love this mixer!!,"I totally love this mixer...I originally settled with the artisian model...and wasn't pleased with it. I like this one much better for it's power, it's bowl lift feature...I had a hard time with the tilt head because the bowl was too close to the head of the mixer making it hard to pour into the bowl. My other one also didn't come with a handle for the bowl which is essential to have. Enjoy and get one yourself you will love it too!!!!!"
3,Amazon needs to stop false advertising!!,Even though this is a good mixer according to KitchAid....It is not the KitchAid mixer that Amazon shows in the picture or the price. The one pictured is KitchenAids's Commercial mixer and the mixer that Amazon sells and you get is not rated for Commercial use. The mixer that you actually get is bulk produced by KitchenAid and normally retails for $300.00 not for $545.00.
4,Boys Love it too!,"This was a Christmas present from Papa and Gramma for my 2 boys ages 4 1/2 and 3.It went together very easy. Solid support structure. Tool came with for assembly.Clean, smooth, I like that it is not finished with paint or stain.Accessible from 3 sides, and that is my only complaint.I wish we had gotten the other Ryan's Room house that you can access on all 4 sides.The middle rooms in this house can only be accessed through the front, so when my 2 boys try to play together, they both wrestle for the prime play spot. But when it's only one playing...no issues at all.We use a train table (now too small for their massive train track creations) to put the house on, easier access and everything is at eye level.The balcony doesn't really attach that well, kinda loose and wiggly, and it's kinda difficult to access the top middle floor with it on. So we just use it for a side yard, deck, and just propped it up on a book."
3,"Fun, cute, but missing things","We ordered this along with the make more room expansion. I love the way the dollhouse looks - it is really cute. It is the perfect size for my 4 year old to play with and I think she will enjoy it for years to come. The design is simple, but detailed enough to not be boring. She can easily access the rooms from the front or side. However, I have 2 complaints. 1) The flowers and flower beds were missing. I contacted the manufacturer twice by email, but never received a response. I did not want to return the dollhouse since we had already assembled much of it and we wanted to make sure it was ready for Christmas. Luckily, it is not an essential part. 2) The interior walls are very poorly made and do not fit properly. With some manipulating, we were able to make it work well enough. Overall, I think I would purchase this same product again because I still like it much better than comparably priced dollhouses and my daughter loves it."
4,What Santa Brought,"We were initially attracted to the house's A-frame design. We wanted a dollhouse that would allow a few children to play easily in different areas of the house. The A-frame allows for this. We favor toys made of wood b/c of our concern for the environment, the safety of our children and we've found that they tend to hold up better than plastic ones. Although, we were disappointed with the flimpsiness of the wood that makes up the interior walls of the house. That Ryan's Room offers an extensive collection of furniture, dolls, etc. designed to be used with the house was also a big draw. We feel this will enable the dollhouse to grow with our 3-year old daughter through the years. The house is also simple enough to allow for my husband and I to add extra creative touches like shingles, additional flooring and paint for the walls. Overall, we are very pleased with the dollhouse."
1,Unspecifiable entry,"From the entry description, customers can't identify the certain volume of Hippocrates Loeb Classical Library published by Harvard University Press.The complete collection of 8 volumes are still available. They are not out of print."
3,Skeletons in the Closet,"In this brooding thriller, Seattle carpenter Paul Sinclair is haunted by a series of tragedies, and is confronted by his family's secret--a legacy of evil that is closing in on him, his wife and their young son. You'll be thinking about the intricate plot twists of this story after you read the last page. As someone always on the lookout for new authors, I must say that Fergusson has written an interesting page-turner, and has laid the foundation for a successful writing career."
3,A Nice Start for a First Book,"I think this author has potential but needs to work on some of the writing. A little less descriptions of how to get to point A to point B would be helpful OR spice up the directions a bit. I found myself skipping descriptive parts that had nothing to do with the plot of the book to get to the good stuff.However, I still liked the overall premise of the book and hope to see more from this author."
1,A big thumbs down for Bruce,"I found this book to be a complete waste of time.It started out strong,then either bored or confused me through out the rest of it! I found the authors style of writing to be too contrived,trying to cram everything together.He also spent way too much time on meaningless description. For a debut novel, i was thoroughly disappointed."
4,Not his best book but still very entertaining!,"I'm not sure what USSHawley was saying about TNG and DS9 being at different times, they are both in the same time frame (on the show anyway). At any rate, Peter David pumps out a book that doesn't quite live up to his standards but it still quite entertaining. He explores Wesley Crusher and the friends that Crusher would inevitably make and lose while on the ship and gaining perspective into Crusher's life has intrigued most Trek fans. I won't say this one is a ""must buy,"" I reserve that for Imzadi, Qinlaw, Qsquared, and Vendetta. However, if you're looking for a very good book, that isn't quite ""great"" you can't go wrong with Strike Zone."
3,Early TNG interpretation of a Star Trek staple.,"Lesser races gaining retribution on their one time oppressors is a recurring theme in Star Trek. It is even the basis of the DS9 series.Strike Zone predates DS9 by many years both in real life and in the Star Trek universe. Being in a different time frame than the original series, this TNG story could utilize the Klingon storyline in a fuller, more satisfying way.Good book for Klingon fans."
4,Easy set up. Works great. I bought another one.,"I bought this to use with my Monster AV remoteMonster MCC AVL300-S Home Theater and Lighting Controller with Omnilink. Setting up this light switch was by far the easiest part of configuring that remote and has worked out so well that I bought another one.Once the switches are paired with the remote, it's a very simple matter to use the remote to turn lights on and off throughout the home. It's a small enough thing, but it's amazing how much easier it makes life, especially if you're like me and somewhat mobility-impaired.I deducted one star for the retail price. There's no reason for these to be so expensive. I bought mine from an Amazon merchant who had them on sale, so keep your eyes open for a good deal."
5,Funny and clean,She is great. She is funny without using nasty words. If you want a good laugh without a lot of filth she is what you ned to get.
3,Nice but faded.....,"I got these to go with the rest of the set, I returned the first bowl as it was too faded, I am still waitting for a refund. I ordered another bowl and that one was just as faded. The print is beautiful it is ashame they are fadded"
1,Poorly finished and chipped on shipping,The salad bowl was more the size of a soup bowl. The quality was very bad and poorly finished. Chipped on shipment. ;(
5,One of my favorite books of all time!,"Cassidy is a historical fiction account of Butch Cassidy's life. It is extremely well written and holds your interest through the whole book. I loved learning about the life of, in my opinion, the greatest outlaw of the west. The only book that comes close to matching this book is Rockwell, also by Lee Nelson. I couldn't more strongly recoment either of these books!"
5,Hard to put down,"I bought this book back in 1996 when i was 12 years old while I was on a road trip from new york to washington state. I read it back then and loved it. I recently found the book in my basement in a box, dusted it off and decided to read it again. Im glad I did. After finishing the book I gotta say Lee Nelson really knows how to keep you into the story. Reading this book was like playing a movie in my head. If you wanna know more about Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch I suggest you read this book."
5,Head turning Gothic Lolita,If your a fan of the Gothic lolita style that's all the rave in Japan I recommend this boots!!! They're in men sizes and can hurt your big toe if you're a girl with small feet (Thick fuzzy socks REALLY helped fix that problem) And you'll make heads turn!! I love love LOVE these boots!!
3,Better Sex Video: The Tantric Guide to Better Sex DVD,"This video was not something I would watch with my husband, it is more educational. Most of the couples are older & we giggled more than enjoyed it in other ways. Although I will say that it was very interesting to see how a man can 'change' his performance. It does have some good ideas on how to become closer to your partner."
1,UNIMAGINEABLY Bad...,"This review will be brief. This ""production"" is SO bad, you may very well actually get physically ill. My Wife actually DID vomit. Many scenes you simply cannot ""unsee"" no matter how hard you try... such as the obese couple bouncing idiosynchratically against each other sitting indian style, and the Crown Jewel of this ""video""... the 70 year old woman enjoying her vibrator spasmotically as if she were having a grand mal seizure. Would give anything to be able to forget what's in this product. Worse than the ""2 Girls 1 Cup Reaction""!!Buy at your own risk. There's far too many nicer things you can buy for $23 that your loved would enjoy instead of *this*... If you do buy it, remember this post... you'll see all was and is true in my representations for you."
3,Mapping America's Past,"Mapping America's Past is an attempt at using maps to portray American social, economic, military, and political development. The maps that are included are excellent, but what was included is somewhat puzzling. The general analysis of wars, expansion, and elections are useful, but maps of political party development in the Cleveland area or prostitution in New York City are not entirely relevant to the general American history student. Similarly, many of the accompanying texts offer little detailed insight into the topics the maps cover.This book should be considered a general resource, but for an in-depth historical atlas, the reader must look elsewhere."
1,The men without a country,"Rarely have I seen a better example of intellectual elites' skewing data to advance a political view--in this case, the loathing of America. Everything the authors could get their hands on, from early settlement, to the causes of the Civil War, to the continued exploitation of differences in American society today, is used to give the impression that America was founded upon hate and injustice, and has prospered only by the exaltation of vice and the plunder of the weak. If there is an example of goodness and virtue that resulted from the American experiment in freedom, I can't find it in this book. Pity Carnes, Garraty, and Williams."
2,"As with all history textbooks, the truth is nary found","History most usually is told by one side, and taught by another side. Book was a gift to immigrants from South Africa."
2,Evolutionary Genetics,I found this book a little difficult to read and somewhat abstract in it's order and presentation.
4,Branding Made Personal,"This book is an easy, empowering, motivational read. I found myself folding over a lot of pages for reference and ideas - ultimately the sign of a good book. It isn't over-complicated or laden with a lot of marketing/branding spin words that don't mean much. Ms. Roffer's background and experience are in the entertainment industry - so a lot of her examples may be a bit out of mainstream America's world making some insider references and terminology hard to relate to - but ultimately, this is a book that should speak to women. In essence, it's a good tool kit to help you realize what's important to you, how to figure out your core attributes/interests - and make it all work together!"
2,Poor design,"This silicone pan's fluted sides are far too ""pointy"", for lack of a better word. The part of the cake in the narrow ""points"" cooks MUCH faster than the rest of the cake, leaving you with burned, or over-cooked edges. My other problem may be common to all silicone bakeware, but this pan doesn't brown cakes, it simply heats them, leaving you with a somewhat mushy and pale cake exterior, especially around the inner tube. I'm going back to a metal bundt pan."
3,lots of tricks - tough to watch,"The video shows lots, and I do mean LOTS, of tricks. It's just in a bizarre, menu-driven format that is a bit tough for my 10-year old yo-yo enthusiast to watch. I think a lesson-based, skill-building format would be better. But hey, I don't make yo-yo videos..."
3,not what i expected,"while this dvd did showcase a lot of tricks, they were all very similar and not challenging to someone with yoyo experience. my nephew zipped right to the advanced trick section which was very small, and breezed thru it. meaning he didn't learn anything new. for a rank beginner this dvd is fine."
4,No Doubt Review,"Jenna tries to patch things up with her older sister Caitlin. Before she had left with the other girls of Eight Prime for California, she had blabbed to Peter about Caitlin's crush on David, Peter's brother--and Caitlin had caught her in the act. Will Caitlin forgive Jenna?When Nicole returns home, she is horrified when she discovers that her parents have gotten her a job with her seemingly perfect cousin, Gail. Gail, however, isn't as perfect as she seems to be.Miguel proposed to Leah before she left for California. Now he seems to regret the impulsive decision he made, while Leah is considering accepting his proposal. The two talk it over. Will they keep their engagement?"
5,it was good...,this was good.. it looks like david is interested in caitlin. it also shows nicole's better side. im glad that miguel and leah are still committed to each other.
1,No Doubt,I think that this book is a very good book to read for girls because moast of the characters are girls.This book ia about two grils that always get in trouble because they do stuff there not supposed to.The two girls have always been that way sinse they were relly small but now things are about to change because now that they are back from there trip they have to take responsability for there own actions and pay for watever the do now that one is eigteen and one seventeen.They go throw alot of trouble adjusting to this new procedure but they have to get used to it.The ending is really funny and surprising.I think that the two girls really have to learn how to get out of trouble.
1,Not worth the money,"I wish I had read the comments before I bought this! I just assumed it would be color combos for decorating (like couches, pillows, curtains, accessories, etc.). Instead, you get ceiling color (who paints the ceiling something other than white?), wall color and floor color (in the bathroom, the only material options are wood and rubber -- where's the tile?). I was totally disappointed. I don't want a book of wall colors that have been changed via computer! If I wanted that, I'd just go to Home Depot or Lowe's and get the little cards that the paint manufacturers produce.Bleech! Don't buy this book. It's a waste of money. I'm sorry I bought it. I'll probably never even reference it again."
2,Great story lost in poor writing,"The book is illogically split up, causing confusion, repetition, and destroying any suspense. The writing is often, at best, cheesy.Most frustrating of all is the presence editing errors on almost every page, including obvious misspellings, such as the ""Big Eat"" Conference, ""Stoors, Connecticut,"" and ""Diana Taurisi.""This story is about the 2001 Final Four Champions; however, the writing would have been knocked out of the first round of the NIT."
4,"Inspirational story comparable to ""Hoosiers""","A friend gave me this book because I am originally from South Bend and like to cheer for ND, but I am not what you would call a sports fan. I know next to nothing about basketball. I found this book to be very inspiring and heartwarming. Anyone participating on or coaching a team of young people would love it. It profiles each player, but emphasizes that each player coming together as a team is what is important."
3,Cold War crime drama,"It is a good read which deals with unusual sleuthing because of its international dimensions. It is well crafted and keeps ones interest throughout. While not in the ""can't put it down category"" it is worth reading."
4,Smaller than usual,These cards are smaller than the usual toddler/ preschool flash cards. But still fun. Age 2-5 I guess.
5,A fast-paced detective novel:,"Winston Simon is a hard-hitting ex-cop turned private eye whose penchant for the underdog sends him from one death-defying escapade to another.From the first chapter, when the Feds draft Simon into smashing a terrorist cell to the end, when personal loss slams him into a corner, we are drawn along, watching him deal with tragedy and romance with insight and a touch of humor.Until the personal loss is too great.Kudos to PJ Lawton for an entertaining read. The last scene before the Epilogue lingers in my memory, just as a beautifully written ending should do. It must have been extremely difficult to write, yet, Mr. Lawton executed it perfectly.We root for this big detective and eagerly look forwardto the next installment. It will go into my personal collection next to Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder novels.Brenda Hill(...)"
2,Restaurants and stores have closed,"The book is very out of date. Don't bother trying to find any of the restaurants or stores listed. They have probably closed or changed their names. Of about 10 establishments I tried to track down, 7 were not there or had wrong directions. There is no update on their web site."
1,Not worth the money,"Ibougt the dics for the church dance ministry. We looked at it first, and I was shocked by poor quality of video material and quite significant price I was charged for it.First, the tracks were switching too fast, after every minute.. After a while the sound disappeared, and I was not able to advance the tracks neither forward nor backwards.The disc was done not only unprofessionally, but also with a poor quality.I hope our dance team still can find something useful in the content."
5,A fantastic love story,"This book has everything I expect from a romance novel. It was great and refreshing reading about the growing attraction between Maggie and Charlie. The ""couple"" meets at a sporting event after trying to set up there friends Julie and Dom.At first they seem to dislike each other more than anything else. Charlie finds Maggie way too controlling and she thinks he is the typical eternal bachelor kind of guy, definitely not dating material. Quickly after the initial introduction of the main characters, it becomes clear that they are hugely attracted to each other.However both are fighting it. He because he got burned by being left at the altar by his fiance, she because she has a boyfriend who is out of town, and Charlie so does not fit her ideal mate description.It is great to read about them eventually getting closer and closer, I just ordered the sequel ""Bride Needs Groom"" and can't wait to read it."
3,"I've read better, I've read worse","Once Upon a Blind Date is my first book by Wendy Markham. In the end analysis I would say I've read better, I've read worse. The premise of the story grew thin after a while and I'm not sure how much I really liked Maggie. She was so domineering. But then, she did make realistic changes as the story went on.I'm sure I'll read more by her but I will get to other authors first."
4,SWEET AND FUNNY! HOW CAN A ROMANTIC RESIST!,This chick lit was so cute and funny; I fell in love with it and the hero/heroine right away. The premise was feasible too! I even went so far as to order five more of Ms.Markhams' other romance titles. She sure ranks up there with others in the genre! You will like it too! I stayed up many a night until midnight until I finished it entirely! (Actually only about three three or four hours stretch per a few nights!) If you want it romantic and lovable? Pour yourself into this one!
5,The Last Blind Date,"Written with great clarity and a sensibility and honesty. From the tragic which she handled so well, to the sublime, the life that follows - I couldn't help laughing out loud reading it even on the subway. I couldn't put it down. What a joy to read! I highly recommend this book. A jewel. Move over Nora and Candace et al! And where are more Randy's????? And Linda's???! And when is the next book coming????"
4,Get in step with Fred!,"This is an excellent collection of Fred's tunes. Although he was known more for his dancing than singing, he could do both very well.I only give this CD four stars because the CD is not the best ever made, and the recordings may irk the serious audiophile.But I like the tunes, and Fred delivers. To me, the imperfect sound quality adds to the flavor. And it is not BAD, scratchy, hissy, or annoying, just not preemo processing.This CD is a real bargain!"
4,Right Up There,"Yes, I loved this one. The CD has two real killers - ""Love Lays It's tune (which may be Mick's best song ever - absolute genius), and ""You Got It"". I rank it in a 4th place tie with ""Russian Winter"" as an overall ranking compared with the other Simply Red stuff. Mick has never had a bad offering and anyone should love this one. I am partial to his ""newer"" stuff so this is going back a ways for me."
3,"Good book, inspiring, drones on in places","The beginning of the book was inspiring. I've never felt that close to Celtic mythos before, and the author manages to put me right there in the myth itself, and make it believable.It does drone on for a while, so I wouldn't claim the full price (even Kindle) is worth spending on it... I didn't really learn anything new that I didn't know before.But the author's humor and voice is certainly worth reading."
3,"Nice magazine, bad service.",I received it before the expected date- so far I got just first issue. It is the same magazine my friends are getting in Russia- I love it!!!August issue is missing for two weeks now. I contacted manager twice- no response.
5,Discovering the oversights of a majority of leaders,"This was an entertaining and insightful world of Management Consulting. The book is filled with practical quotes, funny and at times pathetic anectdotes of Management type errors."
2,small system..OK,I have a Denon AVR888 ...The speakers were blown out within 20 minutes. The other speakers...Pioneers... Same wattage.As well as the center speaker...a JVC!! are doing well.
3,You get what you pay for,"It is important to note that I was NOT EXPECTING these to sound like a high quality speaker set. However many people who reviewed them portrayed them as on-par with much more expensive speakers. So, before you attack my review please understand that. Look at the title ""You get what you pay for."" My only point is that people should not have unreasonable expectations for these speakers based on the positive and over exaggerated reviews.The sound is very basic. Bass is slightly overly-punchy and the high range is a bit dull and quiet. Not bad for a $50 pair of speakers. But don't be fooled by all these reviews. You are getting what you pay for."
4,Nice box,"I bought theses speakers purely for the enclosure, i had a pair of Memphis 5.25 speakers i needed a box for, this box barely held them, its pretty much gheto rigged, but the front cover hides it. 40 bucks, worth it."
3,YOU NEED AN AMP FOR THIS PROUCT!!!,"This is a pretty good product. It was my first speaker purchase.When I first ordered it, I was really excited. I don't have a lot of cash, so I was using gift cards, and my purchase finally went through! (I wanted a different pair of speakers, but I couldn't buy them...)When they arrived, I booked it up to my room and began to put them together. That's when it dawned on me: the cords for these speakers are JUST A PAIR OF WIRES! I NOW NEEDED TO BUY AN AMP AS WELL, making it more expensive than what I originally wanted...Now that it is all put together, amp and everything, they ate amazing.BUT NOWHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION DID IT SAY YOU NEEDED AN AMP! Well, you so.Overall, good purchase. Love the bass (a picture frame fell off my wall tye other say :D) and it has good sound."
3,LOST MONEY,HAD TO RETURN TWO STEREOS FOR MALFUNCTIONS DID NOT NEED SPEAKERS SO THEY CLIPPED ME FOR ABOUT $13.00 ON RETURN OF SPEAKERS - WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO RETURN IF STEREOS HAD WORKED PROPERLY BUT WHAT GOOD ARE SPEAKERS WITHOUT STEREO??? SPEAKERS WERE OK AND SOUNDED OK.
5,good price,these two speakers go great as a addition two my other two great sound rocks the house nice price cant be beat. came as it was advertised and did alot of study on them for determanation. would get to more if i could to ad as a additon. amazon is the place to look. geeat qality.
5,Sony of my owny,"Great speakers for the money! Small footprint on the shelf, sounds great to my ears. Looking forward to many years of service."
4,excellent small speakers,"These little Sony speakers fit right on my bookshelf and sound great. I wish that I had gotten the subwoofer at the same time, as my arrangement does not emphasize the bass these speakers are capable of. At some point in the near future, I will add the 10"" 100 watt subwoofer to our system.I purchased the speakers based on readers' reviews and I am very pleased with their performance. They do work better for music than when we use them to play movies from the laptop. This may have more to do with the arrangement of our house than the quality of the sound output"
5,Great Buy,"Great Buy,Reason I say great buy, because it made a great gift for my husband he loved them which encouraged him to get ridof the old big box speakers taking up valued space.Thank you,"
5,"Seriously, sound better than any computer speaker I had","After building my little speaker system with an amplifier, I just realized that a good sound system does need a amplifier/receiver to power them. If you want great sound but less money to invest, just buy this one. I compared this to s***ty product like Bose C2 and C3, sony just sound a lot better."
4,great speakers,I have a lot of Sony products and prefer to buy Sony quality. These speakers are a bargain for the price. Great range and performace for there size and price.
4,Good Speakers,"I really like these small speakers - at least smaller than the old ones I was using. They fit in the speaker stands I had, but take up so much less space than those monsters! And the sound is excellent."
2,look but don't touch,"My ancient Advent 1 speakers died, and I bought these to replace them. If you filled a bucket with mud and dropped your current speakers into it, you would have an idea of how these sound. Very muddy, indistinct midrange, but requiring lots of power to drive them. As an amateur jazz musician, I like to replicate the sound of a live performance when listening at home. These Sony SSB-1000s aren't even close. Best I can say for them is they didn't burst into flame and burn my house down. Very disappointing."
1,very low volume,bought these with the Sony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiververy dissapointing really expected more from sony returned both!!!
2,"Spend a little more, get a little better","[...]These have no bottom in comparison. The Insignia is larger but still smaller than old school book shelf speakers.The sound of the Sony's was clear but I preferred the fuller bass response of the Insignia 6-1/2. However, the Polk bookshelf loudspeaker at BBY was clearly better sounding of the three ... at 4X the price of the Sony."
1,Speakers didn't work!!!,"I ordered these along with the larger pair (SS-B3000) on some kind of deal. When they arrived, the large ones worked beautifully, but these weren't working at all!!! Because I had bought them on some kind of sale, I wasn't allowed to return them... $100 down the drain."
5,Great sound,Great speakers. Very durable have them installed to a old power amplifier and use it for movies and gaming and a good set of spearks for a bedroom/computer set up. you can use them for a living room but will need a center speaker as well with a sub for a better home theater sound.
5,Love it!,"For the price they have very good base, and also the size. Highly recommend. Very Happy with them. Perfect for what I was looking for."
4,"Acoustically 5, ergonomically 4 out of five","I'm quite happy with this purchase and can find no fault in the sound at this price. I do wish, however, that the speakers had some provision for mounting hardware. And the speaker wire provided is crap, both by gauge and by length... A highly recommended purchase notwithstanding the nitpicks."
5,"Good speakers, excellent price",I needed small speakers to replace enormous ones I've had for 25 years. What a find these are. They have good sound and a small footprint. Amazing.
3,Good Sound,"These speakers were the perfect addition to my old receiver. The sound is crisp, and for the price this is a very nice product."
5,Great deal,I bought these and an insignia receiver for computer speakers and I am very impressed. Great sound and better price
3,Not enough sound for rear speakers,"Sony SS-B1000 5.25"" Bookshelf Speakers (Pair)Bought a pair of these speakers for rear surround sound. I have the Sony SS-B3000 speakers for the main speakers which are excellent. And a Velodyne sub which is nice. At times these little speakers work pretty good after adjusting the receiver. Other time's, depending on what I'm listening to, you can't really hear them. For the price, they are an excellent value. Just need to do alot of adjustments to get much out of them."
3,wrong dimensions,"I expected to receive speakers that were of the dimensions listed in the ad. Instead, I received speakers that were half the size of the product description. They are great LITTLE speakers, but Amazon ought to edit the description!"
2,Not great,"We got these speakers as a replacement for 20 year old Infinity speakers for our stereo system. We found them to be rather tinny and even with the super bass on the stereo system they couldn't create a full sound. Yes, they are cheap, but were not much better than what you get attatched to a portable CD player."
1,Stoped working after 6 months,"I powered them with a sherwood receiver also bought on Amazon, 100w/channel. They worked for about 6 months I play them loud, but maybe a couple times a month, its not like they are on 24 hours a day. I figured they could handle whatever my 100w receiver could throw at them. One night they just stopped working. I tested the receiver with other speakers and they worked. So something happened to these speakers. Not blown, no buzzing, nothing just silence... I am in the process of trying to send them back to Sony for repair/replacement, but i have to pay the shipping and just deal with the BS process of sending them back...When they worked they sounded great, and i'm not an electrical engineer so if i did anything to break them but 125w speaker powered by 100w receiver you would think i wouldn't burn them out in six months."
5,Nice. Very Nice.,"You will want to get the Sony SS-F5000 with these. Believe me, you will know where the money went!"
2,It's a shame that these pass as good speakers.,"There are plenty of better-written reviews discussing this, so I'll keep it short. These speakers have no mid range. I'm less disappointed in the speakers themselves than the fact that the market has been geared toward speakers with too much bass being considered a quality product."
3,AVERAGE SPEAKERS AT A GOOD PRICE,"The Sony SSB-1000 bookshelf speakers are average speakers for their size. I'm not really impressed. Not very loud. They are, I suppose, merely sub-$50 speakers and you get what you pay for, although the sound is tight and clear. However, because of the configuration of my living room, I have positioned these speakers directly to my left and right sides, rather than behind my viewing spot, so perhaps I'm not utilizing them to their full potential. (Maybe when I position them behind my viewing position with Sony's wireless kit, I'll get more out of them.) Still, for $50, they sound clean and crisp, but not very loud. No distortion that I can here, even when cranked. Three stars because they're average speakers (maybe four because of my positioning of them). I hope this review helps you."
2,Should include more detailed information!,"If it does not include the amplifier, please indicate that in the instruction so that everyone knows! I bought it for my laptop, but finally had to return it because I can not use it unless I buy another amplifier with extra $200!"
1,Poor description of use,I ordered these for my computer. They are for an amplifier not computer. Some day I may find a use for them but right now they are no better than junk to me.
1,sony bookshelf speakers,"Extremely poor directions for connecting speakers to Sony CD changer phone numbers included for sony help were not operative, nor were phone numbers given when i called Amazon customer service my attempts at making connection with CD changer were not successful returned Sony changer and speakers to Amazon will not purchase sony products in the future nor any electronics from internet sellers"
5,"work just fine, thank you!","We use these at a local veterans club for big screen tv and music, they work great!"
5,Powerful quality sound in small package,"I needed more space in my living room so determined it was time to retire the 1980's floor speakers that, together, seemed as big as a smart car. Found these and gave them a shot. Awesome, terrific, just as good if not better than the JVC's I had before."
5,Good speakers on a buget if you have a amp/reciver,"I bought these speakers some where esle, to use with my Qinpu Q1 Ampifler, running from my ampilfer these speakers sound very good. Fills up my room and do pretty well in blu ray/HD dvd movies.Also works very well with Dolby Virtual speaker when I playing games with them also.I also try music too also sound good on these But then I have it plug into my Qinpu Q1 which is plugged into my computer running off 2x LME49720 I/V+ OPA627AU buffer Op-amps.I got these to use when people are over or dont feel like using my Ultrasone HFI-780's.They work best with a good reciver or ampiler one that can drive them fully."
3,"Fair Value, But...","I have three pairs of Sony speakers, the SSB-1000, SSB-3000 and SS-F5000. Until recently, I was satisfied with the SS-B1000 as front channel speakers in our bedroom. This month I added a pair of Sony SS-F5000 floor standing speakers for the family room and moved the SSB-3000 speakers from that room to replace the SSB-1000's. The difference in sound quality was quite noticeable. I recommend spending an extra $50 or so for the SSB-3000 for its superior treble and bass. (All three pairs were purchased from Amazon, all arrived in perfect condition and I rate the SSB-3000 and SS-F5000 as virtually equal at 5 stars.)"
3,Speakers are smaller than indicated,"I purchased these speakers for 2 reasons:Size - they needed to fit a specific placeRating - they had a good overall rating on this websiteThey sound o.k. for SMALL speakers -- the description (even on Sony's site, which they have probably changed by now due to my complaint) says they are 15"" high, when in fact, they are only about 10"". Had I known that initially, I probably would have chosen something else, but did not have the time the send back & reorder."
4,Great speakers for a small apartment,Have had theses speakers for over two weeks now and am using them as my rear speakers. Sounds great and wont break the bank. I live in a small apartment though...if you live in a large home these mostly likely arent the speakers for you.
5,Best Bookshelf Speakers for the $$$,"I'm not saying these are the best bookshelf speakers ever, just they're the cheapest quality speaker pair you can find. I bought these to use in my garage. They are acting as secondary surround speakers in my 4 channel stereo set up I have in the garage. These speakers are clear & crisp at medium to medium/high volume. If you start cranking em, that's when you'll notice some distortion. But, I'm not trying to rock my neighborhood with these, just listen to some tunes while I'm changing my oil or what have you. My main speakers are Klipsch Icons. Those I can crank up...but I also paid $250 for the pair. So, like I said before & like my review title says, these are the best budget bookshelf speakers you can buy!"
5,"Wow, just fantastic sound","This was totally worth it. it's not equal to $500 bose speakers, but it still produces really incredible sound, especially for the price. granted i am playing it off of vinyl, so maybe im a bit biased."
5,"Great sound, great price.","This is our first sound system. Our current set-up is the Audio Technica AT-LP60 USB record player, the Lepai LP-2020A+ Amp, and these Sony SS-B1000 speakers. The sound is so far above the laptop/tv/desktop speaker sound I'm used to. I think these are the perfect speakers for a first home audio system."
3,Sony bookshelf speakers.,"I suppose they're worth the money but I didn't really find the sound very good. I bought them for a friend so I'm sure she would have to say, ""For nothing, it's good""."
5,Sony speakers,Incredible sound for the money. Just waiting for sub (also Sony).Should be a full-spectrum delight.....
4,Just what I was looking for,These speakers produce a good sound and will work for either surround or just extra speakers.
4,Very good speakers for the price,"I use these speakers for the rear channel speakers in my surround sound system and they are great in that capacity. Sound is clean and crisp. They don't come with wall mounts, but a simple set of shelf brackets from the nearby home superstore worked great. For the price, I didn't mind sinking a few screws into the cabinet to secure them to the brackets. They are surprisingly heavy for their size and should do fine as front channel speakers if the demands aren't too great. A bargain."
2,not so great to me,"i'm not sure what i was expecting, but honestly i guess it depends on what you want. I'm used to listening to monitors, and compared to monitors they sound muddy to me, depressingly muddy. This could be the fault of my receiver, I don't know. I wasn't as impressed as the rest, but it depends on what you're after and how critical you are I guess. I listen mainly to instrumental and classical. If you're just using for a room I'd strongly reccomend some quality monitors with at least a 5"" woofer. I prefer things true to the recording I guess. Anyways, that's my take"
4,Perfect to upgrade HTIB (3 ohm speakers),"I bought these just for the purpose of upgrading my sony HTIB 570 receiver. The front speakers that came with that system were not even 2-way. I was concerned about the impedence rating of these speakers being 8 ohms instead of the 3 ohms on the supplied HTIB speakers. Reading around I was convinced that the 3 ohm speakers cannot cause any damage to my receiver because higher impedence equals lower load. But I was concerned that the output volume is going to be proportionally low from these speakers. BUT it turns out that the sound was only about 20% lower than the 3ohm speakers and this was easlily adjusted in the HTIB systems menu. Now I can use the HTIB system to play music decently. Dont bother upgrading if you just watch movies on htib systems. The supplied speakers are fine for that.Minus 1 star because the main speaker does not seem 5.25"" wide. But I dont care because I have a subwoofer."
3,A good value,"Good for extension speakers, surround speakers or budget main speakers in a bedroom, study or dorm. Good build quality. Fairly inefficient meaning you'll need at least 25 to 50 watts per channel to get room filling sound. Tendancy to sound ""boomy"" due to the lack of internal fiber glass insulation."
5,Great buy,"These speakers just amazed me when first installed, and I continue to be very pleased with them. I had purchased smaller ones, of another brand, and returned them, as they were worse than nothing. The sound from these is great - I'm not an audiophile, but do appreciate the accurate reproduction that these speakers provide. The price was great for a very good product."
5,Great Spekers,Great speakers at a small price and size. Sound much better then you would think for the size. Using them for an old projection TV that one of the speakers gave up.
3,they are what they are,"These speakers were purchased along side a simple sony reciever. They are decent little speakers that will serve most purposes. I use them in my sound room after blowing up an old reciever and bose speakers. These haven't quite compared to the last set-up. For $ 49.00 they are ok. If you are really picky about good qaulity sound, you'll have to dish out more money. For everyday basic use, they'll do the job."
4,Great upgrade over USB speakers!,"I had been listening to my music through a set of logitech USB speakers for years, and had forgotten how much more there is to hear, even in a low-grade MP3 file. I'm using these speakers with a simple Pioneer receiver, connected via an optical cable to an Airport Express using AirTunes. They sound good, especially given the $50 price. I plan to supplement with a small powered subwoofer and center channel speaker as the budget allows. Can't beat this setup for a small guest room/office setup on a budget."
4,Great Speakers but be a handy with a drill,These speakers give great sound! no complaints. However if you want to mount them to a wall you will need to drill holes and purchase keyhole mounting hardware as there are no holes/hooks on these speakers.really easy to do and worth the effort but make sure you order keyhole hardware for surround sound.
4,"Good sound, compact speakers","We have had only one problem with this set of speakers. When we were connecting it to the amplifier, one of the speakers' sound kept cutting off. It was difficult to insert the wires so that they connected properly. Each of the other components had a better way to insert the wires to connect the other components. Otherwise, the sound is good and we are pleased with the speakers. They look nice and are small enough to put where we needed them to be. Generally speakers we have had last a very long time and we hope these will, also."
5,Good Speakers,Not much to really say other than the speakers are great and replaced some older Infinity one where the cones had eventually given out after a long service life. Hopefully these will last just as long.
5,"great, using them for rear surround speakers",We decided to replace the satellite speakers we had as our rear surround speakers with these. It made a huge difference. They are much louder and much more prominent so all those background noices or sounds that come up from behind you in movies are ten times better. They also sound incredible when we do 5-channel stereo and play music out of them. Great speakers for around $25 a piece.
5,SONY Does It Again!,"For the price these are great speakers. I use them in a bedroom/computer system to play CD's, DVD's, and other sounds, such as youtube videos. They are very clear and balanced from low to high. They do not have BIG BASS, but the bass is good enough to hear bass instruments clearly. I am very picky about sound quality, and I really like these little guys. I have played jazz, rock, prog rock, and praise and worship on these little speakers, and all sound very good."
5,Great value and performance,We needed a small set of bookshelf speakers and these fit the bill perfectly. They are easily hidden while still providing excellent sound. Great purchase.
5,good buy fr the money,sounds great and fills out my room. Am using as rear speakers for my family room with a large TV. Big sound in a small but attractive box.
3,"Decent performance, nothing special.","They are reasonably clear, the form factor is nice, and the build quality is good. However, there are lots of speakers in this price range that are a lot better performers. There was nothing below the high mids, which isn't abnormal at this form factor and price, but plenty of other bookshelfs do it better. I did notice that they seem to like being driven by a pretty powerful amplifier."
5,Sony SS-B1000 Speaker Performed as advertised,I needed set of speakers to support my DENON 7.1 surround system. They matched perfectly to the sound output requirements
4,they are what they are...,"Sony has never been known for great speakers, and these aren't going to change that. There are good speakers, and there are cheap speakers. These are (decent) cheap speakers. Well made, even color wood and quality grills. I put them on an old Kenwood rig that's driving a pair of vintage Def Tech towers. When I switch to these, the lack of bass is stunning, of course, but I expected that. Out of the box, they sounded terrible, like an AM radio inside a can. I let them play for a few hours, and they improved significantly, but they still sound -very- speaker-ish, crispy highs, 'boxy' mids, and very little actual bass. They are adequate if you have space limitations, don't want better for whatever reason, &/or plan on playing mostly lo-fidelity sources, like talk radio, TV or pirated audio. If you want to hear more music than speaker, you'll spend a lot more, so, 3-stars - an honest 'C' - for doing what they're supposed to do, and a 4th star for affordability."
5,Worth the BUCKS!!!,"I paid like $130 for 4 channels and a Center Speaker and it was worth it. If you don't want to spend a ton of money for a good sound than this is the setup for you...I found it works best to put the center behind you and the 4 channels, 2 in front and 2 on the sides.All in all, I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Why not,"I cannot believe it! Thanks a lot my imagination! I choose this productafter several browsings.I have made the right choice.Sincerely,"
3,Not bad for the price,"These are OK spearkers if you are on a budget. I also have a pair of older JBL speakers the same size and they are much better sounding, and require less power. If you just want these for rear suround sound speakers I recommend them, but don't buy them for main speakers."
4,Inexpensive speakers; Not great sound,"Well, these speakers are cheap - only 50 bucks. They work and look just fine, but the sound quality is not great. I notice that they especially dont hit very low notes. I think I expected them to sound a little bit better than they do, but I think they perform reasonably considering the price. I'm just using them as second zone speakers in the same room as my main home theater system, mainly so I can listen to music as I play video games. Since I have competing sound, quality isn't really a concern.If you're just looking for relatively inexpensive speakers to simply produce sound, these will do the job."
3,Needs to go deeper,"For a lay person, Love Beyond Life represents a great introduction into the world of spirituality, and the concept of life/energy after death communication. But, I would think that when you are ready to go deeper, read the near-death stories by people who have died and gone into the light, and came back. It might comfort you even more. People like Betty Eadie (embraced by the light), Tiffany Snow (psychic gifts), or Dannion Brinkley (Saved by the Light). These highlight the deeper Spiritual things of what happens when we die. Perhaps through the NDE, and perhaps through astral travel, we can see the real heaven. Indulge yourself! Continue on the path to be a higher intelligence in the universe! The world needs it, doesn't it?"
2,Comfy but easily dirty,"I purchased this item from the retailer on ebay not amazon because amazon wouldnt let the seller ship to puerto rico where I live. Now as far as the product it was super comfy and very plush exactly what I expected from a ergonomic mat. The print is also exactly what the image shows but the colors are slightly off. The edges are not a beige like depicted they are more of a mustard yellow definitely not beige. This item also attracts pet hair like a magnet I am having to clean it twice a week with a comb to get the pet hair off and I have a labrador a short hair dog! This also stains very easy just from regular traffic in the home the border turns more yellow over time, I have had it two or three months and now. And the top piece of material is starting to peel up around the edges. This product is cheap and I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Not as much life in the live,"The description is inaccurate: Only the first two tracks with Johnny Griffin are live--and Griffin has little to say.The fourth track is Gordon with piano, bass and drums, and it's fine. The best tracks are three and five. Woody Shaw and Curtis Fuller check in, backing Eddie Jefferson vocals on ""Diggin' It"" and ""It's Only A Paper Moon.""So it's a mixed bag, hence only 4 Stars. But if you're an Eddie Jefferson fan, you'll want it. Wounded Bird Records did their usual excellent job with the transfers."
2,Another Pretty Cookbook with Little Substance,"I like the photos and the concept of this gourmet slow cooker book; however, after trying a few recipes I gave up because they simply did not taste good. With one exception that is - the chicken tarragon was delicious. Unless you're looking for a pretty coffee table cookbook, save your money."
4,Gourmet Slow Cooker cookbook,Excellent collection of new ways to use the slow cooker. I have just started to pick and choose some recipes and I will enjoy picking more.
1,Awful recipes,"I really should have sent this book back. It is not spiced and seasoned correctly for any of the ethnic foods I know well. Some I would not try just from the name. I mean ""Oatmeal Soup""? Why would one make ground beef stuffed bell peppers in a crock pot? Why would anyone cook eggplants in oil in a slow cooker? So they get to be grease balls?As an experienced ethnic cook, I found this book to be a unusable."
3,My first bad cookbook review,"I just got the book last week; decided to try the boston baked beans (which my husband loves). The recipe was vague as to how much water to add. I presoaked the beans overnight, then put in the slow cooker with other ingredients for 12 hours and they were inedible (hard and watery). What a waste of time!"
3,Mediocre,"After hearing the author be interviewed on National Public Radio, I thought this cookbook to be the ideal gift but after purchasing it I was disappointed. There is too much background of a very few countries and too few recipes. Not worth even Amazon's reasonable price."
2,So far it all tastes the same,"I've made three different recipes, all supposedly from different countries and all different, but somehow they seem to all taste the same. Rather disappointing..."
3,"Great Meals, but not simple","This is my first slow cooker cookbook. The instructions are easy to follow. I've made a couple of recipes from the book and have no complaints about the taste. One thing I could have done without is the grinding of your own spices, which most if not the recipes call for. It would have been wonderful if there were alternate measurements on ground spices."
4,Unique tasty recipes,"I agree with another, not enough recipes - the opposite of the 'Fix it and Forget it' books, which have too many. Also, in contrast to those books, there are only a couple in here that you can actually fix in the morning and leave all day, but then they do taste better than those. Most are ready to eat in less than an avg workday, and require too much prep for a workday morn (suggestion - make as much as possible ahead the night before). I've tried 4 recipes so far, and they have all been better than your average crock pot dish. I've had difficulty getting the spice level right - 2 I made were lacking in salt quite a bit, one was way too spicy. I really like the uniqueness of the recipes. The best cookbook I've found for crockpots. Oh, I also like that most have a picture - I'm a very visual person..."
5,Great International Cooking with Ease,"I work 6 days a week and never seem to have time to cook so I love my Crockpot. I had the old Rival Cookbook that I ordered years ago and love some of the recipies, but knew ther must be something out there with Indian, Greek, and other International Recipies. I found exactly that in this book! I love the Dublin Coddle recipe and have made it many times. The Eggplant and Pea Curry is also very good."
3,Cook with caution,"I just received this cookbook and have just tried one recipe but ran into problems I found documented hweb. First of all, none of the recipes give prep or cooking times, and they do not indicate how many portions each recipe makes. In making the Beef Burgundy - and I was home, fortunately-it became dry after 4 hours on low so I added another 2 cups of wine for a total of 4. The reciepe calls for just 2. Had I not been home I would have had a dry, tough meal as others have mentioned on the web. I like the ideas and ingredients and will experiement with more but I until I test while at home, paying close attention, I will not be able to just put the prepared foods into the crockpot and feel comfortable coming back some hours later. Seems like a cookbook written by someone has more of a hobby than a professional cookbook with all the full details."
4,Nice recipes,"This slow cooker recipe book has a variety of wonderful recipes; I was especially delighted with the polenta recipe. Typically, polenta requires a great deal of attention on the stove top, not so in the slow cooker."
1,This one's going back,"I purchased this cookbook due to the glowing reviews. Like many, when I cook using a slow cooker, I do so because it's a simple process. A number of the recipes in this cookbook require that you grind your own spices (calling for 6 whole peppercorns, half a cinnamon stick, etc.) - and no measurements are provided for using pre-ground spices. This seems like a very out of place ""gourmet"" affectation in a slow cooker cookbook."
4,Beyond Bean Soup,"So many slow cooker cookbooks I've used are redundant...with the same recipe being presented over and over again with only one or two ingredient changes. The Gourmet Slow Cooker is definitely a different kind of cookbook. The recipes are interesting and unique. The book is organized by regional area, and the diversity in flavors and tastes is amazing.Most of the recipes require a little more attention than the typical, ""Throw it in the pot and set it to high,"" mentality presented in other slow cooker recipes. While I won't be using this cookbook for my typical work days, the recipes look like great options for the weekend when I have a little more time for prep."
3,Somewhat over-elaborate,"I wasn't impressed by the initial blurbs on each country (and by the way Great Britain has FOUR countries not three) nor by the wine/beer recommendations. These sound like padding (just who bothers to seek out the recommended bottle?). As for the recipes themselves, they all appear to need lengthy cooking before going into the slow cooker. Surely the point of a slow cooker is that you produce good-tasting food with the minimum of fuss. On the other hand there's no warning about boiling beans for 10 minutes beforehand to avoid poisoning one's guests (such a recommendation does however come from the manufacturer when you buy the slow cooker).As for the recipes themselves, there are several which sound good (though occasionally,eg Chicken Mole, you wonder whether they aren't just too elaborate (ancho chiles AND pasilla chiles...) and with some adaptation most would taste good. There is also a reasonable amount of variety. It is well printed and illustrated."
5,Great cookbook!,"A Chef actually told me to get this. I have yet to make anything, but all the recipes look awesome!"
3,ok cookbook but I'm not so sure I'd buy it again,The cook book is ok. I'm not sure how much I'll use it but it does have a few receipes that I might try.
4,Lovely book,"Like it's sister volume (there are two in the series so far), this book offers tasty slow cooker recipes that require some prep work. This one has more sophisticated recipes; the other volume is more ""down home, comfort food."" Both are good -- at least the recipes I've tried so far have been consistently good."
2,The recipes just aren't very good,"I was excited for this book. It's beautiful and has a lot of interesting recipes. I was also excited to use a slow cooker cookbook designed for an avid cooker like myself. The problem is that many of the recipes taste similar or just aren't very good. Some taste terrible and many are poorly executed. It seems like they weren't tested before they were published. I have made the Lumpy Mashed Potatoes, Chicken and Dumplings, Beef and Guinness Stew, Beef Burgundy, Provencal Beef Stew, Chicken Piperade and Italian Pot Roast. The chicken and dumplings is the only recipe I would make again, but I probably won't bother since I have at least two other chicken and dumpling recipes that are vastly superior. I am going to try some recipes from other regions, but based on what I have made so far, I would not suggest buying this book."
2,Really Slow Cooking,"The recipes were more difficult than I anticipated. Many have to be started on the stove top and then placed in the slow cooker. Being a working mom I want to be able to throw everything into the cooker, leave the house and come home to a meal that is basically ready."
4,Slow Cooker Possibilities,"I think one of the main benefits of this book is that it makes you think of your slow cooker in a different way. This book is about potential and possibility; it is a good starting point for your imagination. The recipes are well written and the photography is beautiful. There are about 55 recipes.I would have liked more recipes (I don't eat pork or red meat), which is why I gave it four stars. If you are looking for a large volume of contemporary and traditional slow cooker recipes, I recommend Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook. It has 350 recipes. The recipes in Gourmet Slow Cooker are more exotic. If you are just starting out or can only buy one book, get Not Your Mother's ... . Gourmet Slow Cooker is an excellent enhancement."
3,Another suggestion....,"This is a beautiful book. It is only around 100 pages and includes exotic recipes from around the world. The pictures are gorgeous. But there are only a handful of recipes that I might be tempted to try.If you are looking for a more comprehensive and accessible volume that covers slow cooker cooking, I would highly recommend ""Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook."" It was less expensive but much more exciting and substantial."
5,Amazing!,"I was about to have my third angioplasty and have changed my mind since my chance (miraculous?) finding of this terrific book. Normally a skeptic, I just kept reading. Then I looked up chelation in Dr. Rosenfeld's Guide to Alternative Medicine. His open-mindedness toward chelation was overwhelming. Since finishing Dr. Cranton's book, I've decided to find an MD who can get me out of the HMO quagmire and give me relief from carotid artery, leg, and cardiac vascular problems. If what you've done doesn't work, you change course!"
1,"Alas, all the worst sort of bunkum","Asked to check into chelation therapy for some ailing friends and relatives, I did, hoping very much to find something that would offer hope and help to those who were moving beyond the capacity of conventional treatment to cure.Regretfully I found absolutely no evidence beyond the hype of chelationist ads and the desperate hopes of the ill that chelation therapy is anything other than the worst sort of snake oil.There have in the last several years been several excellent studies done to determine the efficacy of chelation therapy. Not one demonstrates any effect beyond that caused by caring health care workers and hope. While those effects are interesting, they are not life saving.For a sobering and very fair discussion, go to the Quackwatch site, http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chelation.htmlMy best wishes to all."
5,Ngiyekeleni,"Rebecca Malope is the best African gospel singer, she has a way of getting me in the praise and worship spirit. Her music is very spiritual and she gets me close to the lord every time I listen to her sign.Two thumbs up."
4,Great Fun,"This book is a lot of fun to read through -- you get a lot of history, with background on the culture of T&T, the origins of the T&T carnival, along with many calupso rhymes and the origins of many of the foods and recipes. I've always wanted a recipe for true Pina Coladas, and the recipe for Ginger Beer sounds more like a science experiment, but my son and I plan to try it out. Instant island vacation!"
4,Relevant typographic history,This book provides useful & interesting background of some of the most enduring typefaces we work with. All type geeks will appreciate it.
4,Visual Comparison of the Great Typefaces,"The visual analysis of letterforms make the book worth the money. No other book is as broad in comparing the different ""cuts"" of the classics. If you are bewildered by the vast number of type faces availible, then this book will explain how so many similarly-named and similar-looking faces came to be and how to discriminate among them. The book will teach you be more selective in your purchasing of typefaces."
4,Realistic Plush Alligator,"I bought this alligator for part of our VBS program at church, for decoration. It is realistic, and well made. It will now stay on my son's bed as one of his ""friends""."
5,My 4 yr old nephew loves it.,"This was a wonderful Christmas gift to my 4 yr old nephew. It looks life-like. He was ""hunting alligators"" in the swamp."
1,dont waste your money,This toner doesn't even last 2000 pages. I appeared to be original manufacturer equipment but it didn't last a week. I used it to print about 2000 pages and I had to open a new one. Don't waste your money.
4,A Classic for the Shift of Ages,"Somehow I failed to read this when it was originally published, but reading it now, at the cusp of the Old World and the Birth of the Age of Aquarius seems appropriate. Many of Callenbach's prophecies have come true, gradually and without fanfare. Others we're still working on; and yet other ideas we have improved upon and will do even better. I'm so glad this book has become part of our collective awareness at this special time."
5,excellent book,"Personally, I thought this was a great read! I sincerely hope Ectopia 2 comes to Kindle as soon as possible!"
4,"Interesting, but dated",Great idea for writing about world's problems. Failed to deal with the realities of poverty and health care needs. Those problems need to be included in any world vision.
1,Hippytopia,"I lived in Northern California during the 1960s and 1970s and I feel that the book is less about environmentalism or ecology or sustainable growth or anything objective and more about the author's own journey from an ideal happy life in a rural farm in Pennsylvania to a painful experience in Chicago and finally to some kind of childlike euphoria in the hippy culture of northern California in the early 1970s.Although he chose the title as Eco-topia what he actually describes is his version of the final fulfillment of the hippy ideal of life. The book is much more readable and digestible if we think of it as a novel in the fairy-tale land of Hippytopia where trains traveling at 225 miles per hour provide no seats or seat belts but cushions on the floor and recycle bins marked Metal, Glass, and Plastic and where passengers relax with a communal joint. It is in many ways the final gasp of hippydom. Don't bogart that joint my friend, pass it over to me."
1,"Ecotopia is like 1984, only far more so.","Ecotopia is like 1984 by George Orwell, only far more so. A horrifying picture of a world in which everything which does not conform to the credo of the Green Communists, on Green Nazi's is mercilessly rooted out. Should be read between the lines to discover the Green Big Brother behind all the all too nice sounding stuff. Should be read as a dystopia to be avoided at all costs, instead of a utopia to be desired."
5,Good value - almost free?,This book was purchased at amazon because of price alone.It was a college class requirement.It was so cheap that I did not think it worth the hassle to check one out at the library.Good job on your prices amazon!
3,Slickly packaged propoganda.,"The main problem with the idea of an ""ecotopia"" is that no such state would be able to fend off its neighbors for long. Do you really think a bunch of California hippies could hold off the rest of the United States in a civil war? In the real world, California would be reintegrated with the US by lunch time. A state organized on these principles would simply not be able to exist for long before being swallowed up by its less enlightened but more aggressive neighbors. Sorry. ""Those who beat their swords into plows will plow for those who don't.""But as another reviewer wrote, this book is an excellent way to look at the emotional appeal of radical environmentalism, and as such I recommend it."
4,Great book price!,The book was in OK condition (could have suffered minor bumps and scratches during the shipping) and it took almost a month to get here (since USPS takes forever to ship internationally) besides that the everything else is good. I paid only a cent for the book so that was awesome and a major plus. Thanks
3,Ecoptopia,"The book was ok, the only reason I'm reading it is because I'm in a book club and that is the book the person picked. I would have never pick this myseld."
2,Dissapointed,Ecotopia is kind of a scary place to be honest. The people there all seem like drugged-out cult members. There are better books to spend your time reading.
1,Fageddaboutit --,"Sad attempt at scifi -- billing itself as political it fails at that too. Simplistic and underwhelming, it's difficult to persevere [we had it assigned in our book club] -- if you're interested in scifi U- and Dys- topias, check out the realf stuff - Ted Sturgeon, David Brin, the Hyperion novels, etc,etc"
1,Ecotopia as a socialist state? Not a great idea.,"If you believe in Marxist ideas, than maybe this book can be seen as a nice approach to environmentalism. But if you love this country and the capitalistic and democratic ideals that have made it great, then you will see this book for the sham it is."
3,"Good, but w/o a lot of regular literary components","While I found this novel engaging, and hard to put down, there were many problems with the piece itself. One of the main criticisms that can be heard about this book is the lack of characterization. The protagonist is woefully under-defined. I almost felt as if his ecotopian lover was more interesting than he was. As well, many of the protagonist's friends in the novel are without development. Second, everything in the novel fell in to place far too easily. Everything bordered on a pleasant fantasy, instead of something that could actually happen. The idea is intriguing, and this novel certainly could be seen as a manifesto for a 'stable-state', the lack of realism turned me off. And finally, I was dissapointed in the climax and resolution of the work. I knew by about half-way through the book the exact outcome of the ending. All in all though, it was interesting. I would recommend it as a good read, but not without criticisms."
5,Not a Normal Novel ...,"This is not a book about plot or characterization; it is a book about an IDEA. You may or may not like the idea ... that's up to you.Other reviews describe the idea well enough - basically that society ""could be"" organized around environmenal awareness and it might be nice to do give it a try. If you are looking for gripping plot or deep characters, you should go somewhere else.But if you are interested in an idea that was radical at the time, and still pooh-poohed in our present day, then this is a book to read.Indeed, the idea is so important, that this book should be read (... and criticized!...) in any decent educational curriculum. As such, this is a fine book and well worth your time, so long as you don't expect yet-another-normal-novel.What a pity Frank Herbert or Connie Willis didn't write this book. Pairing the IDEA with plot and characterization would have made it so much better!"
4,great product,"I have owned only Uniden radar detector, I have never had a problem with any of them. In all when ever I have upgraded to a newer module I beleive that the newer module is much better than the one before. I strongly suggest all uniden products."
2,Interactions I and II review,"Interactions I and II provide basic knowledge in Mandarin Chinese. The learning activities are decent, but I would recommend purchasing a text that contains an audio version of the text. One such example is A New China. One can learn how to read and write Chinese without audio, but pronunciation will still be very poor. Also, I do believe that this book was published in Taiwan. Some of the characters are a bit different than those from mainland China. Despite these shortcomings, Interactions I and II will provide a starting point for those interested in Mandarin. But for a few dollars more, one could purchase an even better beginning."
1,"Product good, lousy customer service","Although the watch is the one I wanted, the provider and service was worse than horrible. The product was sent to the wrong address, and the company took no responsibility in helping to right the situation. They were quick to respond to e-mails and place the blame for the mistake on everyone else, but never offered to help. It was an item valued over $300."
2,Looks good at first,"I bought this watch a couple years ago, and was wearing it regularly. After a couple months, the crystal had deep scratches, so apparently it is not sapphire glass. A few months later, the band started to tear at the hinges, eventually tearing completely through.If you want a watch to keep in a box and look at, good choice.If you want a watch to wear, try Tissot."
4,The Yeast Syndrome,I had this book in the past. I found the information very valuable in my efforts to deal with multiple yeast-related health issues.
2,The Yeast Syndrome,"Though the book contained useful information, in my opinion it was a ""dry"" reading. Parts of this book were very technical and difficult to follow."
2,Beware of pseudoscience,"It is very convenient to come up with a vague diagnosis for vague symptoms. There is very little hard evidence to support this diagnsosis. I am sure that there are people who are sensitive or allergic to yeast who feel much better when they avoid it. I think the problem is that anyone who doesn't feel good has symptoms that fit into those attributed to this problem. Testimonial benefits are worthless. Watch late night TV for diet products, hair growth products, etc... if you doubt that. I do agree that if we all ate a natural preservative free diet, exercised, etc.. that we'd all feel better. I am just not ready to attribute that all to yeast hypersensitivity and the authors have very little real evidence that this condition exists or is the cause of problems for so many."
1,WORTHLESS...OUT OF DATE INFORMATION...BEWARE!,"This book was published in 1986. I'm insulted that I purchased a book that was written using old science references which can very well change in later scientific studies, whether due to new medical technology or standard of methods used to do a study. I was lead to believe that this book was something new with fairly recent journal article support and new medical lab test suggestions. I regret this purchase as well as the shipping charge that cost as much as the book...the book that I consider worthless because it is OUT OF DATE.[....]NANCY BIRKNER"
5,The Yeast Syndrome,"I walked around with a bloated painful stomach for a year. The fatigue was debilitating, and and I was always in a fog. I did the phase one diet for five days and it was as if the fatigue and fog just washed out of my body. The greatest feeling was the clarity of thinking returning. Even if you don't read anything in the book, the diet is more than helpful; I think that understanding of this diet is essential if you have this problem. It will make a difference; for me the difference felt life-saving."
5,Always Perfect,"Abby Mandel has always been a favorite of mine, I'd cut her recipes every week from the Chicago Tribune and try them out a few days later. This book does not disappoint, Abby has given us many great recipes anyone can be proud of preparing and serving. She is easy to follow, concise, and ingredients are readily available. A great book for anyone's collection from a truly enjoyable cook and author."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this book along with ""Food from the Heartland"" and ""Cooking from Quilt Country"". What I was after was traditional, homey foods from the Midwest. The other two books hit the mark, this one didn't at all. I suppose I should have read closer the editorial reviews on Amazon; reading it now I see that they definitely give me the sense that this is a book of recipes perhaps INSPIRED by traditional Midwestern cooking, not traditional Midwestern cooking in actuality, especially rural or farm folk. The author may be a native Midwesterner but she's definitely written a cookbook for the north shore ladies of Chicago, not for those who are looking for traditional, down-home Midwestern food. Check out the other two books I mentioned. They're great!"
2,Too many typos in the code,"This book is unix based, so not many newbie programmers are going to stick to the weekend timetable.For the experienced unix/C programmer this book is fine because they'll spot the errors.For someone using windows on a pc with little programming experience it will get difficult or even impossible when they hit the first typos in the code examples on friday night. The sections on downloading modules and cgi programming will be a complete non-starter, and thats about half the book.Joe Merlino obviously knows his stuff but the typos are mostly the result of block copying code and then forgetting to make changes - and of course not testing it.So - there are a lot of good books on Perl out there, and a lot of good articles on the web. This is not one of them"
4,GOOD DEAL!!!!!,"These two TV films are from the TV series ""The Star and the Story"". Both films had my complete attention. For a budget DVD, the picture quality is quite good and splice-free. The only problem was that the ending credits were faded out 15-20 seconds early. Otherwise, the films appear complete."
5,Great quality and good for engines needing ZDPP,My muscle car's 383 loves this oil. It is one of the best oils out there that has a ZDPP additive that my camshaft requires. I combined it with half a bottle of red-line break in fluid and my engine is performing great!
2,Mediocre at best,"Generally an accurate depiction of a deaf girl's childhood in a hearing family and environment.If I were younger, I'd enjoy this book a bit better. There are not many books with the main character being Deaf. This book scores solely on the factor that the main character is Deaf. Great for these little girls who are Deaf out there.But other than that, this book is mediocre at best. The writing is bland, the storyline tired, the characters undeveloped, and the countless typos annoying.A disappointing book overall."
4,Deaf Child Crossing,"I read this book for a book report. My mom picked it out for me. It was interesting because I have a brother who is hearing impaired, but not a severe as Megam in the book. I saw how Cindy did things for Megan as my mom says I do for my brother. As far a relationships you should choose your friends by what you have in common and sometimes just being different is what you might have in common. Make sure you are honest with each other."
3,A LOOK INSIDE OUR YOUTH,"THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE. ANYONE WHO WORKS, OR IS INTERESTED INWORKING WITH YOUTH SHOULD READ IT. WHEN I STARTED READING IT I COULD NOT STOP. INETERSTING. HOWEVER, IT IS SOMEWHAT BASIC AND COMMUN KNOLEDGE. WITH NO TRULY INSIGHT INTO THE REASONING."
4,"Like life that it describes, the book is a little messy","The book was supposed to be about the author spending the first season of the Brown's with his dying father. But like so many things in life it does not go exactly as planned and the father dies after the first preseason game. The author improvises a little and does backwards looks at his relationship with his father. He also examines the strange relationship between a town and its team. The town pays for the stadium to bring the Brown's back, but it is not really a team of the common Clevelander, which is probably true of most of the NFL. While these are the two main topics (the author's relationship with his father and the new Browns) the author bounces around on other topics such as his own drinking issues and race relations in America (or at least Cleveland). In almost every topic he touches he shows how life is almost more complicated and messy that it seems it should be. Overall, a good read for football fans."
2,McGraw running away from the truth,"While I applaud the author's honesty, I am saddened by his unnwillingness to grow and change from this experience. For all his just-as-I-am bravada, Mr. McGraw, in the end, seems destined to drink away his life as a means of running away from himself. I found it fascinating -- and a tad pathetic -- that he writes with such confidence about his so-called life. But like his drinking, it's obviously just a way of ignoring the truth. His ""drink a beer and do it again"" life has that swashbuckling feel of life lived boldly. But it's really a selfish life. And I can't help but wonder when he's going to grow up, look in the mirror and ask himself: Is this how I want my daughter to remember me when I'm gone? When she writes her book on me? I can't remember when I've read a book that offered so little hope or inspiration."
2,ordered wrong cd,"I love simply red he is a great artist however this cd was a bad buy. and I waited to late to mail it back, oh well"
3,"Uneven, but worth the price","""Men and Women"" is an uneven effort, with Mick Hucknall again making some uninspired choices in cover tunes. However, ""The Right Thing"", ""Infidelity"", ""Suffer"", and the gorgeous ""Maybe Someday"" make this worth the price of the album. Reviewers often seem to knock Hucknall for what they consider to be failed attempts at ""blue-eyed soul"", but I disagree; he's got it knocked. Not their best effort by far, but some truly shining moments."
3,pretty good,"i always dug there style.songs like the right thing,shine&maybe someday sound pretty good."
5,Best book I've had,I am getting my master's degree in educational administration and this is the best book I have had to read so far. I could actually see myself using many of the ideas from this book when I am a principal. It is an easy read but worthwhile.
2,Product went too fast,The only lasted 3 weeks in my vehicle and when I stop there is a lot of black stuff on the rims.Rodney Russell
2,"Passable quality Moore shows, horrible serial video","This is just a short review to say the Clayton Moore shows are enjoyable enough, but the Lone Ranger serial is about as poor as you can get. The serial has long been considered lost but turned up in a print with Spanish subtitles. That is the one used here, and it is truly bad video quality and they have enlarged the image to hide the subtitles at the bottom of the print used.Even at the cheap price of this DVD set, it is isn't worth it. Stay away!"
2,"Beware, The Serial video quality is horrible.","Just as a warning to others and to back up what has been said, the video quality of the serial is horrible. The pictures is extremely out of focus and the audio is horrid. If you are buying this set for the serial (Which I did), forget it, it is not even worth a dollar.However if you are buying it for the TV show then you are in for a real treat. The show still holds up real well today and has what I consider excellent Production values. The video quality is a little iffy as is the audio, but still worth the price.As a bonus you are treated to the awesomeness of Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger! Clayton Moore is spectacular as the Lone Ranger and along with Jay Silverheels makes this set well worth buying."
4,Lone Ranger - The Legend Begins.,A good movie for the children. I was a bit disappointed to find that it was in Back & White. It would have have been better in color.On the whole it was is a good DVD and I recommend it to others.
1,Don't Bother,"I am not a fast reader. If I can finish a book in fifteen minutes, it probably isn't much of a book. That is certainly the case in this instance.If you think that a list of cruise ship lines -- which you can get at your local library -- is worth $13.00, then by all means buy this book. Otherwise, save your money.If I had turned out a piece of work this flimsy and full of technical errors, I wouldn't admit, as Mr. Marin has, to having a Ph.D. Maybe he had a better proof reader for his Ph.D thesis than he did for this book.Although he has attempted to provide useful information, most of what he supplies is available elsewhere. I can only hope that Mr. Marin's music-making is more satisfying than his writing."
4,Monster Ext cable for Sirius Antenna,After spending about an hour trying to figure out what i had done wrong i finally concluded that the cable was defective. i returned it and the new one worked flawlessly. If not for the defective one i'd give it 5 stars.
4,Catfight with robots,Nuku Nuku is revised again. A cat in girl robotic body. Same character. It was to perdictible too watch.
4,Decent work for New Rites,"Even though this book is intended for Priests of the Roman Catholic Religion, as a Minister I found it useful. I have always been a fan of the Catholic Rituals, Vestments, and Vessels for Liturgy and have used Catholic Rites in my own church. This book will give you the updated versions of Rites for blessings, consecrations, mass, and so on.If you can get a copy of it, there is a much better and much older book called PARISH RITUAL that gives the pre-Vatican II rites in both Latin and English. If not, this could be a fine substitute."
3,My daughter love's this book- I think it is just ok.,"Well, I have to say first and foremost, that I love Harriet Zeifert books. This one was a disapointment. Like I said, it was just ok. The illustrations are nice, but very dark, and it is difficult to read the black text at times. My daughter on the other hand loves this book. She thinks Susan is a riot when she gets out of bed, wanting to sleep with Mommy and Daddy. This book would be good for a child who doesn't want to sleep in their own bed. That is not my daughters case, so other people might enjoy this book more or it can be a help to their children."
2,Not a very helpful book,"We were really hoping that this book would help ease our three-year old's mind about sleeping in her own bed. Instead, the story line only ended up extending our bedtime routine as three-year-olds like to procrastinate going to bed, and this book made it easy to justify putting every animal and thing into it's own bed before going to sleep. The illustrations were cute, but overall, the book did not help our daughter sleep in her own bed. A light up turtle actually did do the trick!"
4,Uniden PC68LTW 40 Channel CB Radio with Front Mic,"I've always used Uniden 2-way radio products since the 70's and have never had a problem with any of their products. This Uniden is no exception and hopefully it will remain that way. I have no reason to think otherwise. The Uniden PC68LTW has a professional look and feel to it, even though it is a mid-priced CB Radio. The speaker is loud and clear and, although I was going to add an external speaker, I now don't need to. It's that good. The back lit dials are absolutely great, especially at night, but they are good even on dark cloudy days too. People receiving a signal from me have stated the power is good and the modulation is great too. I guess for $79, I can't ask for much more. I would recommend this brand and model to friends of mine (and have...) I also appreciated the fast shipping and decent deal made here on Amazon.comKen j.Nehalem, ORDuuuh Beeeach"
4,Satisfied,I bought this CB for my husband for Christmas. He really likes the radio the only downfall is that it took quite a bit of time to fine tune. Once the radio is fine tuned the distance is close to 5 miles. One of the reasons I purchased this radio is for the weather ban feature. I thought it would be useful in nasty weather having access to up to date weather information. He says the weather ban feature is very nice and he has used it several times. He likes the information he is able to receive on the weather ban. Overall we are very satisfied with this radio.
2,"Like legal search firms, focused on top tier/ranked lawyers","I found that this book, while interesting, only applies to lawyers who graduated from top tier law schools at the top of their class. There are a lot of lawyers who did not graduate from top tier law schools and were not top of their class. I wished this book addressed attorneys in latter position, or at least considered them. I would love to have read about an average lawyer who is sick of the law, quit and started another career as real estate agent or the like. I would like to have seen more ideas on career choices that law could relate to and more time spent on the process of starting another career, how it was done and steps taken. This book is not much use if your not a top graduate who is practicing at a major New York law firm. And if you are...good luck to you in breaking free."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I found the book a bit disappointing ... not many new ideas here, some of the websites are out of date (the copy that I have was published in 1997), and there is, IMHO, an awful lot of filler. There are pages and pages of specific examples and lists of resources. Only some of it is interesting and useful.I did find the number of typos and misspellings more than a little irritating in a published volume giving advice."
2,"Doesn't sit quite right, and absorbs food odors from the microwave","The title says enough. Somehow the combination of the peppermint and yesterday's reheated pork chops resting on your neck/shoulders just doesn't have the appeal it should. And speaking of that, the way that this is designed, it just doesn't rest anywhere helpful. It's too short to do much for the neck, and sits too far forward to get the parts of my shoulders that feel sore and tired. The Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat-Cold Neck Wrap for Neck and Shoulder, 21"", which I also got from Amazon does pretty well for the neck (but doesn't reach the shoulders at all so don't believe the hype), is relatively inexpensive, and does not carry any lingering odors from the microwave after heating up."
3,Not his best but...,"I read ""The Langoliers"" several years ago, and while I didn't think it was one of King's stronger novels at the time, the images have stayed with me. Flying in fog invariably brings back disturbing images of the desperate passengers who had shifted dimensions. King's descriptions of the sense of nothingness packed such a wallop that long after I'd forgotten the characters themselves, the eerie atmosphere of ""The Langoliers"" has embedded itself in my imagination."
1,You call this a novel?,"Normally I could say I like Stephen King's works, but this is downright awful. An airplane flies through a time rip and only a handful of passengers survive, including some of the most idiotic characters I have ever read about. A Jewish violinist who kills a man with a TOASTER?? A drug addict on her way to rehab? And a businessman who rips paper to shreds to relax? I have to say that ""The Langoliers"" is a completely dimwitted book, and I don't see why this would interest anyone."
3,excellent but incomplete,"I ordered ""The Nineties"" because a friend of mine had lent me her copy and I loved it. So I ordered the book and enjoyed it. The arrangements do a wondeful job of maintaining the original song's sound. However, I feel that the book was rushed in its production... I don't think a book of 90's music should have been released before the 90's were over. As a result of this, many recent hits are not included. The book also has many controversional groups (boy bands...etc.) and not much in the line of rap or anything. Overall, a great buy but don't expect too much from '99."
2,"Not as pictured, low quality Pakistan scissors","The photograph shows gold handles which means the scissors pictured are tungsten carbide (a higher grade, hardier steel). However, what came to my door are plain, very cheaply made, Pakistan scissors with corrosion on one of the handles. These are a far cry from the scissors shown. Also it took several weeks to arrive. Complete bait and switch. Very dissapointing. I would send them back, but it's not worth the return shipping."
1,Stick to the Football!,"Whilst no doubting Roy Keanes ability on a football pitch, I was left extremely disappointed with this book.The book charts through his life from growing up in Mayfield all the way through to Saipan. This would appear to give enough scope to learn something new about the man, but in keeping with his image, the book lets nothing slip. It is a very safe book with few insights into his thoughts apart from the obvious - Alex Ferguson (he loves) - Mick McCarthy and the FAI (he hates) and the famous Halannd comment.I would not go near recommending this book as I feel no-one (even a committed Man United fan) has anything to learn from it."
5,KEANO! KEANO!,"I could not put this book down, well written and a great insight into the heart of a true Manchester United warrior."
3,More Keane,"Having followed football for a few years and being familar with Mr. Keane's antics on and off the pitch, I thought this was going to be a little more entertaining. It was a very good read, but I can't imagine the author is this drab. He is an Irishman!"
3,"Tell it Like it Is, But Tell More !!","I like Roy Keane..He is direct,explosive and successful without possessing the sublime skills of Best or Cantona. The book is written in the same direct style as his playing. He tells it straight but is lacking in detail. You get a glimpse of the man without really ever getting inside his head. He shares the highs and lows (and even his first salary with Man. Utd.)...but lacks the capacity to captivate the reader like a good biography should. Most of what is in here, you already know...Interesting glimpses of life as a successful sportsperson but lacking the cutting edge that he delivers on the football pitch..."
5,Keane...inside the mind of a winner,"This book allows an individual to enter the mind of the talented, agressive, and determined Keane. His intensity for life is shown as well as his desire to succed. FIVE stars for the field general."
4,"Solid, interesting, well-written","An interesting inside look to the world of football. Keane has plenty of interesting stories to share, and he also isn't afraid to tell his opinion. I didn't agree with everything he said, but the points he makes about what it takes to win and how easy it is to let yourself think you have tried your best are worth reading"
4,Fun with Scooby,"My daughter loves Scooby-Doo & the gang. This is a fun way to experience Scooby without watching a whole video. The only problem that we've experienced (me, not my daughter)is we are getting repeats of questions now. Easy for my daughter because she remembers & can get the answer correct, but frustrating for me since I would like a longer round of questions before getting a repeat. It is fun to play, though."
5,SAILOR MOON ROCKS!!,Sailor Moon is sooooooo cool in this book. It's about to become the end of the Universe and then Hotaru shows up and turns into Sailor Saturn. She drops the Silence Glaive and the world is about to be destroyed again when... Can't tell you any more or it would give away the plot. Reccomened to everyone.
3,review,"the product was fine, in good condition. However, I recieved it late, and although the seller did contact me promtly after the first email, the rest of my emails were ignored. Not sure if I would do business with this seller again."
2,"Empowerment Expert, Success Coach, Speaker",This is a very superficial read. The title is better than the book. Don't waste your time.
3,it's okay,"this mounting kit works for what i need. butit could be better... There are only 4 ""pads""and i think it should have, at least 8. I had tocome up with my own pads to complete theinstallation. Even 12 pads would be better.Larger contacts would helpto prevent damaging the surface of what everit is mounted to."
4,DUAL LABEL REISSUE,"Searches for Herbie Mann- BRAZIL BOSSA NOVA AND BLUES should be directed to this item since it contains 5 of the 6 tracks from that United Artist release from the early 60's plus 5 Bossa Nova tracks from 2 Atlantic releases RIGHT NOW 4 and LATIN FEVER 1. The omitted track was a very brief,very fast one. The lesser known, low key tracks from the United Artist session are very good too. Other soloists are Haygood Hardy vibes, Billy Bean guitar and on one track, Sergio Mendes piano.--51 min."
1,Disgusting,Very Painful and Degrading cover for individuals who love cockatiels or any other birds for that matter!
5,Choose Licensed MBC America Release for Best Quality,"For the best audio and video quality with the original broadcast English subtitles, look for 'Studio: MBC America' under Product Details. MBC America is the licensed US distributor for Yi San. MBC America works from the original MBC-TV master recordings and hires professional translators for the broadcast subtitles, which are also used for the DVD release. Each episode runs about 60 minutes.D. Bannon is a professional translator. He has subtitled many popular Korean dramas, most recently Dong Yi,The Great Queen Seondeok Vol. 1andTime Between Dog and Wolf. He discusses subtitle translation inThe Elements of Subtitles, Revised and Expanded Edition: A Practical Guide to the Art of Dialogue, Character, Context, Tone and Style in Subtitling"
2,Disappointing,The music is great but the DVD side only has one performance on it. I love Poncho Sanchez but this DualDisc CD is not worth it. Buy one of Poncho's other CD's and you will be much better off.
5,Just a fabulous cookbook,"Everything I've made from this has been excellent, and quite a number of the recipes are fairly simple. In particular, I like the thai grilled chicken with sweet and spicy garlic sauce and the burmese pork, which starts out great and actually improves as a leftover. This is definitely a book to have if you've ever liked a curry."
4,Serviceable and Entertaining,"My goal in purchasing this book, which pulls together information about birds, shells, dune plants, and fish was to be able to pack one slim volume instead of the bag of field guides I usually took to the Outer Banks. After two trips to North Carolina in the last year, I have found that I still need to carry a couple of other references because this is not comprehensive in any one of its categories--and how could it be at 148 pages? However, Meyer's guide does manage to cover many of the specimens commonly found along the Carolina coast. Furthermore, it is written in a graceful voice that keeps you reading long after you've put a name to the beastie you found on the beach. It is not childish or simple at all, but it can be used by the entire family. It stirs wonder."
2,Hidden City,I was looking for another movie. This one was terrible. Lame is the only word I can think of. It isn't the sellers fault but I will be more careful next time. The condition of the video also was fair - poor.
3,"not bad, but not what I had hoped.","Necroville is fun enough, but I was kind of disappointed. The two main characters see an ad on television motivating them to join a supernatural extermination agency. The Commercial is voiced over by a Christopher Walken sound alike, and I was kind of dissapointed there was no fakey Christopher Walken character for the two mains to fight zombies with. It's still vaguely a ""what if Randall and Dante from Clerks were on the Monster Squad?"" movie which is okay, but the dialogue isn't as punchy as it could have been.Most original ending of how to kill a vampire ever. This is a rental, not one to own, but you'll be glad you saw it."
5,Why not,"First of all yes he migth be rude, he migth be obnoxious, he migth be anoying, but he is always rigth, a lot of people around the world hate him because he says what no one else is willing to say, and people not always can handle the truth so why wont we learn a how to talk back to people just like simon!!! its perfect"
3,Lilias! Alive with Yoga: Intermediate,"Lilia is great and years ago I have practiced with her on the educational channel. However, I think that she rushes through the postures and does not emphasize the importance of breath and holding the pose."
2,Kind of Disappointed,"We were disappointed with the quality of the product, but very pleased with the way the company worked with us to resolve the issue. I will probably give them another chance if they have what I am looking for next time."
4,"Great Rilke,Less Mood",This translation and selection is really made with love. Yet I could not fail but noticing an unbalance between Rilke's radical work on Love and the difficulty of the translator and critic to approach it without being surrendered. As the title suggests. Read it!
1,The names of movies are on here rate 5 stars,"thanks to the next reviewer here are the 6 names of moviesThe 6 movies are: THICKER THAN WATER; ORDINARY MIRACLES; THE COLT; FIELDER'S CHOICE; A CHRISTMAS VISITOR; ANGEL IN THE FAMILY >all fine movieschfancier"" fancier of fine movies"""
4,Two great movies for the price,"Both of these movies are worth owning. If you like the hallmark movies, these are true to form for them. I love Lindsey Wagner anyway. Good family movies for the kids to watch and enjoy and of course, they have great messages of family values."
3,Not O/P in Australia,"Winner of Children's Book Council Picture Book of the Year 1974.A classic of the Australian bush. A bunyip is a kind of mythical creature which lives in creeks. This bunyip wants to know what he looks like and who/what he is.In his quest for self-discovery he encounters rebuffs from a platypus, wallaby, emu. then he meets a man who looks right through him and tells him bunyips don't exist. Finally he achieves affirmation through meeting another bunyip.It sounds like a bit of existential angst for the picture-book set, but it is fine. The illustrations are a bit dark and gloomy in places, but faintly reminiscent of Maurice Sendak.A good addition to a library collection."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A children's picture story book, set in the Australian bush. This illustration is excellent, and gives the book an overall whimsical and sweet feel that nicely complements the tale itself.Definitely a good, simple introductory type book for kids, and let's face it, bunyips are cool."
1,bad item,"I bought this item and i have no idea if it is a bad multi-plug but for some reason my playstation 2 will no pick it up or anything connected through it, cards couldn't be read or controllers could not be used while connected to this device. They work when plugged into the playstation 2 itself but not through multi-plug."
2,Not The Best,Most of the songs are o.k. The only ones that really stand out are El Presidente and DJ Laz. I would not recommend.
3,very useful for one,"this bag is fine for one child, but i can't imagine it would hold everything for two. while the main compartment could be a little bigger, the pockets are plentiful. i use one of the outside pockets for my cell and keys. my husband isn't embarrassed to carry it either. i am like this bag and recommend it for someone who doesn't want it to look like a diaper bag."
3,An Entertaining Little Read,"I first heard about this book on a TV interview and, as a fan and writer of Christian Sci-Fi myself, I felt I should pick it up to show my support. It wasn't quite what I expected, but not in a bad way. I guess I was looking for daring spaceship battles, laser fights and other such Star Wars-type stuff. What I found was actually what I think of as a ""Space Prairie novel"". It is very character-driven, often focusing on simple home life...just in deep space. The plot was solid and, although I lost track of the characters a couple times, it was an easy and entertaining read. The book is filled with typos but, if you can look past that, give this book a shot. It has a clear message without being ""preachy"", but it doesn't back down from its faith, which I can always support. Like the previous reviewer said, it's definitely geared towards older kids."
3,works but does not filter noise,"This works as expected with iPod mini but does not filter any noise. If it is plugged in and the iPod is playing it produces noise, most probably because of electrical noise coming from the car charger socket."
2,Horribly noisy,"The box says you can either ""power"" or ""charge"" your iPod with the Powerjolt. To me, ""power"" means listening to the iPod while it is plugged in to the Powerjolt. However, there is an overwhelming amount of buzz and static when the iPod is playing while connected to the Powerjolt. Maybe this thing works ok to ""charge"" while the iPod is not playing, but it is not an acceptable way to ""power"" the iPod while it is playing."
2,Buzz Buzz Buzzzz,I know that its normal for chargers like this to generate some noise that is audible through the car speakers when playing music but I just couldn't stand it. It honestly wasn't that much buzzing and had I kept the charger longer I probably would have gotten used to it and not heard it at all but I'm picky about those type of things. So overall I don't recomend it but I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter which charger you buy your still going to get some buzzing.
3,It works well...,... but why would they not include a cable for hooking it up to an iPod Nano in Griffin's own iTrip for iPod Nano? That's just silly. The correct cable cost an additional 16 bucks.
2,Broke after 3 weeks,"Purchased this item a week before I took a 2 week vacation in Asia. The dual time setting was nice for keeping track of local time and ""home time"". However, the analog clock stopped working halfway through my vacation. Would just stop completely. Tapping the glass lightly was enough to get the clock mechanism working again."
1,The only watch I've ever hated,"Poor design - why would you want to view time in both digital and analog? No option to set LCD to display date, for instance - have to push a button for that. Watch is upside-down for wearing on a belt loop. Buttons are easily pushed, so the alarm and hourly chimes are constantly going off and the time and alarm are constantly being reset while simply wearing the watch.Strongly DO NOT recommend!!"
5,Michael's Gemstone Dictionary: Metaphysical Properties of Gems and Minerals,"I have several books on metaphysical properties of stones and crystals, but what I like about Michael's Gemstone Dictionary is the way the properties are grouped by what they help with. For instance; if you are wanting to find a stone or crystal to help with healing a body part, you would look to the chapter on the Physical Body. Here you would find ALL of the stones available for you to choose from in one place. You wouldn't have to know the properties of any one particular stone, the information is in on place. It's very easy to use even for a beginner. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for metaphysical properties of stones and crystals.nana5527"
3,Other reviews are very misleading,"I've read all of the reviews about this product and others like it. As far as Androstenone attracting women at all, it doesn't work. I bought this hoping that it would attract my wife, it hasn't, she hasn't even noticed the smell of it. The only reason I give it three stars is because I happen to like the smell, so I don't think it was a total rip-off. Even when my wife was in the mood for sex, the Androstenone did nothing to get her going. :-("
4,It smells good,"Recieved the item today,my wife says it smells good....time will tell on results claimed by the manufacturer.I am satisfyed by the scent"
2,No funciona,"Simplemente no funciona, lo he usado en distintas ocasiones y el resultado es el mismo, no lo recomiendo para nada"
4,Anecdotally Effective,"I have noticed a marked improvement in being able to chat with the ladies when I'm wearing this stuff.My local Physician's Assistant, (of whom is also a delightfully attractive young lady), INSISTS on delaying my depature from my medical appointments whenever I wear it. Oh she's professional, but I do notice the little things like that, with her, and other ladies elsewhere.They won't rip your clothes off, but the stuff does make them more agreeable to talk."
3,Im not sure,"Tested this product. I masked it with another cologne because I did not like the smell of it alone. I didn't get any special reaction, but I also only used very small doeses. More to come. Oh btw the way it dispenses the pheromone is very difficult (Resistant like tube)"
3,"Nice scent, negligible results","I really like the way Androstenone smells, but I can't say I've noticed any increased attraction. If anything, girls tell me that I smell nice LESS often than before."
3,If your goal is to simply hear music they will work...,"I bought these speakers to replace the rear speakers in my 2001 Jeep Cherokee. First off, my prior experience in car audio. I have installed several sound systems in different cars that I have owned over the years. I have had fairly expensive setups in past cars. I also used to be employed selling car audio at both Curcuit City and Best Buy. I am a little older now and have a child and spend my money differently. These speakers will work depending on your goal. As reflected in the price, are not your top of the line audiophile setup. They are better than blown or poorly designed factory speakers. I would even venture to say that some of the newer factory speakers would sound better. They make noise and you can hear the music. No dramatic lows or crisp highs. Just decent sound at an affordable price. For me, they work well for the rear speakers freeing up more money to be spent on the front speakers which you hear more of anyhow. Good luck!"
3,It was even better ar 45 RPM....,"I wore the vinyl version of this album. This track was interesting in that you were encouraged to play it at different speeds, but in the days of turntables. (The warning was that 16 RPM-- which is the version of the CD version-- could damage your speakers.) I found that 45 rpm was the best, and it became a favorite study album, and something that would resonate in my head for days afterwords.If you are able to edit the sound file after you buy this, and can take it up to the equivalent of 45 rpm, and you want a mind-altering album, give this review 5 stars. But I'd have to agree that the decision to release it in the 16 RPM version was a BIG mistake-- hence the lower review."
2,Watch Someone Read The Book,"I imagine the book Becoming Orgasmic might be pretty good & actually helpful. It seemed like it had some good ideas from what I could tell as the actress on the video read it outloud. This video consisted of watching a couple go through the processes / exercises in the book - listening to her thoughts, and watching her complete the exercises. It wasn't very helpful at all, especially since it couldn't include all the tips or instructions given in the book. I'm not really sure what I was suppose to get out of it. It might be slightly benefical if you also ordered the book but I doubt it.Also the book and video are geared towards women who have never had an organism. If you are even slightly orgasmic these will not be of any value to you."
3,purely beginner's info,"If you have NEVER or have absolutly no idea how to have a female orgasm, this DVD can help you. If you do not know what a clitoris is...........you need this DVD. I can say it is tastefully done, though dated, early 1990's, felt awkward in places, like I was a voyeur in a loving couple's relationship..........This was difficult for me to judge, because I am far past this stage."
2,Wife DId Not Like,Actors are not attractive and overall this is just blah! My wife watched it once and tossed it the next day.
4,The Last Hawk,The story is very well written. Good action and story lines. I have enjoyed reading this series by Catherine Asaro and recommend to other fantasy enthusiasts.
1,Not good,"This might be the least interesting thing I wasted my time reading since I was dumb enough to read Twilight.I wont elucidate the many things I didnt care for - suffice it to say I found the characters boring, 1 dimensional, and I just wasnt able to find half a red damn to give about any of them."
3,I'm glad I read Primary Inversions first.,"Although her previous novels are not required to understand Last Hawk, I recommend reading Primary Inversions first. Asaro's skills as a writer improves with each novel and although Primary Inversion was published first it was written after Last Hawk. Her Skolian universe is so vast and rich, and Last Hawk focuses on a very small portion of it. I will recommend this book to Asaro's fans, since each novel links to the others creating a rich tapestry."
5,Very good Advanced Radio.,This Radio has all the settings you can find on any CB radio. Very advanced and user customization. A bit heavy but ok.Microphone build is ok but I don't like the Silver front it looks cheap.
2,ACL Pain,"The author is very thorough when discussing ACL injuries, surgery, and rehab. However, he doesn't address other types of injuries. I had a meniscus repair and was disappointed to find only a half a paragraph writen about meniscus injuries."
3,Overall a good buy,"I bought a few of these to make small loafs of pumpkin bread for holiday parties and whatnot this season. I found that they warped a little bit while cooking and took quite a bit longer on the same heat to bake than my metal pans. I wonder if a slightly higher temp may have worked better like a ""dark coated"" pan often needs."
5,Love it!,This is a great product. I tried it for the first time last weekend and it worked great. No sticking problems and it was easy to use and clean. Makes me want to bake some more. Just have to find some good recipes.
2,Dissapointed,"While this recording contains many great Doors recordings and moments, there are too many uninteresting moments that are basically a waste of precious time. I can now say I prefer live performances that have the less entertaining parts edited out. While a true fanatic might not want to miss a single solitary moment of the concert in its entirety, I prefer only the best be presented to the rest of us. I like the Doors. I think they are great, but I don't have the time to sit and listen to the tedious portions of their live recordings."
1,stop rereleasing the same stuff over and over with a diferent title and cover art....,"jeese i love the doors and have all their stuff, but this is getting stupid...so 5 stars for the music, and 1 star for it being released for the 100th time."
5,Comfortable and stylish!,I LOVE these shoes. They're comfortable and beautiful. I always get compliments when I wear these
3,It was a hard book to follow,I thought Good Hope Road was a hard book to follow because it switched characters every other chapter. It was sad in some parts. I thought it was nice to see the main character gather the pictures and to see her neighbors were helping each other out.
1,Schmaltz!,"I couldn't even finish this book. Got about 1/2 way through and gave up. Couldn't stand the corny country characters and the flimsy plot that you could figure out before you even turned the next page. If I read another ""I reckon"" from a character in this book I was going to lose my mind. I enjoyed her first book, don't bother with this one."
5,Outstanding!!,"Lisa Wingate has a gift for storytelling. She is able to get the reader into the story, feel what the characters feel and see the scenery around them so much it is like being there. I enjoyed Tending Roses and couldn't wait for Good Hope Road to come out. The book is about a tornado that destroys a Missouri town and it is amazing that the book was released during the week of the worst tornado disasters on record in the Tri-State area. I hope it gives some readers the same strength that Jenilee and Mrs. Gibson found. Perhaps it was meant to be released now at this time for this purpose."
2,Not my favorite,"I was not too thrilled with this book. I had read ""Tending Roses"" and liked it. This book kind of droned on. By the time I got half way through, I gave up on it. Sorry."
3,it was not the best book i've read,"I haven't finished this book, but I do know that it is not the best I've read. I find it boring because it seems that the same thing repeats over and over. Maybe I should finish it, but I don't know if I want to."
5,Excellent!,"This is the best book I have ever read. I don't believe anyone could read ""Good Hope Road"" without learning a lesson about life. Read this now- you'll be glad you did!"
5,Very heartwarming and beautifully written,This book was one of the best I have read in a long time. All of Lisa Wingate books are wonderful. She has a way of writing that makes one cry. Many lessons to be learned from her stories. I have read all 5 of her books and am eagerly awaiting her next one which I have already ordered but won't be out until November.
5,Railways of Southern Africa,"This book is a companion to Railways of Northern Africa. The subject matter is excellent from a historical point of view, albeit a little out of date. Alas, this book and its companion were written in the mid 1960's, and the map of Africa has changed considerably since then. Most of the countries spoken of in the book either do not exist or have changed their name. However, as a study of railway creation in colonial Africa, the book offers an interesting insight into the decisions behind the creation of many (but not all) of the railways in Africa, as well as some of the hardships involved in building them and the choice of gauge. The only issue I have with this book (and the successor volume) is the lack of information on the Islands surrounding the continent - Madagascar and Reunion to name two."
3,Definately not the best.,"This strategy guide offers a complete walkthrough of the game and, at times, is quite helpful. But the walkthrough can be very confusing because there are only a couple pictures on a page. The few pictures are small and black and white. The guide also shows no maps, which would be VERY helpful. Because of the binding, this book is also hard to keep open while playing the game. I would recomend Prima's guide because their guides are usually the best you can get."
3,Aragorn costume did the job but kinda cheesy and cheap looking,My son enjoyed wearing the costume but the overall quality of the costume was a bit lower than we expected based on other costumes we have bought. It worked for the one occasion he wanted it for but he probably won't use it again. It also needed some of kind of hair piece to make it realistic. The wig we bought separately didn't work at all.
2,"Cheap and shoddy, you'll have to supplement it to make it work","The tunic is basically what you are paying for. The belt fell apart before I got it out of the box. The cape is thin and seems kid sized - in fact the whole costume would probably fit better on 10 year old kid than a grown man even though its labeled as ""adult"". The fake bootie tops look really cheesy. I guess I was expecting better from an ""officially licensed product."""
2,Boring,"I would have loved some scary stuff. I would have loved some suspense. I would have loved characters with whom I could sympathize. The New York Times Book Review said this book had ""the perfect plot for a summer beach novel"". A good, long nap would have been better."
3,Not what I expected. Cool though,"I though these would make the ride much more comfortable, but the 1.9"" tires I had before felt better. I like the look and traction better with the hookworms though, so they get to stay. Just need some fenders...Be sure to measure the space on your frame, these barely fit in my trek 850 frame."
4,Hooked on Hookworm,"I love this tire! It was exactly what I've been searching for to add a new dynamic and practical usefulness to my Dual Assault Cannondale CHASE MTN Bike. I now can use it not only to downhill & trail ride but I can realistically use it as a commuter to work. They are so FAST! The only draw back is in the rain they might as well be racing slicks, vertually no traction. However, they're great on hardpacked surfaces, I love'em!MickyG"
4,Worth it!,"I bought this to show my 2nd grade class. Reading Rainbows, in general are tops, but some are better than others. I like 3 out of the 4 DVDs,(but for the price, it is worth it even for the 3). I judge this purely by my class, they were not wild about the DVD that pertains to music. One of the episodes on that one is an older one, and honestly we didn't even finish it, but if I remember, it didn't use the typical Reading Rainbow format. All the other episodes in this collection were a big hit though, and the DVD with Taxi Dog on it was worth it right there!"
5,One of my favorite books,"I love the ""Classic Series"" and I almost think it should be required reading for every Christian. But then, of course that would be kinda legalistic wouldn't it?Anyways, I believe this book is spot on as far as what Christianity is about and I thank God that He completely took away our sins forever, so that He can live in us forever. What a life changing truth, about an offer from God that is hard to refuse."
3,Good...,"This I guess 2nd edition of Bob's CLASSIC 1st edition is good but hardly a succesor to his 1st WONDERFUL, 'Classic Christianity' which is one of the most important commentaries of the faith. Stick to the original it's so much better."
3,Not Their Best,"When I first heard this album I was a little disappointed because I expected it to be as good as their first cd ""Abriendo Camino"", but it wasn't. The lead singer Miguel Santana failed to deliver the songs that I so much loved from the first album. The more enjoyeable songs on the album are Julio Iglesia's ""Abrazame,"" ""Ay Mujer,"" and Roberto Carlos's ""Detalles."" Songs like Menudo's ""No Puedo Olvidarme De Ti,"" Estas En Mi Mente,"" ""Como Me Haces Falta,"" and ""Comunicate"" are just to poppish and simple."
5,A masterful explanation of biblical predestination.,"Aside from the Bible itself, this book had the greatest impact on my understanding of God's plan of salvation of any I have ever read. Written from the perspective of a 5-point Calvinist, Dr. Clark fully and faithfully examines the doctrine of biblical predestination.Granted, this book is not easy reading! I kept a Bible and a dictionary close at hand (although some of you Ph.d types might not need the dictionary) whenever I opened it. But any ""work"" that went into the reading was more than amply rewarded with a rich understanding of this doctrine that seems to frighten and confuse so many Christians. Dr. Clark loaded the book with irrefutable, Scriptural justification for his position.I could not recommend it more highly!"
2,"Sensationalism, save your money","You can get paranoid over anything--there is no vaccine for Hepititis C (unlike B), which can cause liver cancer in 40 years and can be spread by needles in hospitals, and speaking of liver and 40 years, certain non-fatal species of malaria lay dormant in a human liver for 40 years before becoming active ... further, you can catch malaria (the fatal kind) by visiting an international airport in the USA where overseas transients and mosquitoes are found (so-called ""traveller's malaria"").According to the FDA and USDA, there are no known cases of BSE in the USA, and this book attempts to prey on people's fears to the contrary. Even the European scare arguably was overblown (since no clear nexus between rendering and BSE has ever been found, and some of the victims of BSE were too young to have been affected by prions).But, you can believe what you want to believe, and some people believe in Roswell aliens..."
4,"""Psychologically Ultimate Seashore"" by ENVIRONMENTS","It's difficult to review the ocean. This CD is a recording of the breaking surf. And that's it, for a full 60 minutes. Once released as a double sided LP, the CD does suffer from a slight editing problem where the sound ""breaks"" for a few seconds during the recording, but this flaw is barely noticeable.This is a wonderful CD for meditation, relaxation, and sleep. Definitely do not attempt extended ""active"" listening with this CD, as it does not contain anything but the natural sounds of the surf. It does not contain subliminal messages. It is meant to be played at a low volume as ambient sound. This tranquil recording is especially effective for insomnia. Setting your player on ""Repeat"" will give you a nightlong loop of sound to sleep by.There are numerous ""Environments"" recordings, some of which are out of print. I recommend them all, especially ""Wood-Masted Sailboat,"" and any of the several ""Rainstorm"" recordings."
5,wonderful recordings - more on CD please!,"This was a record that lasted me through many years. I am now very happy to have it on CD. I am HOPING that more of the records will be issued as CDs. The quality of many ""nature"" CD's are very poor... or have music blended into them which just does not work. This series is wonderful, Tintinnabulation is also great but hard to come by on CD."
2,"Don't like it, not worth the money","It was soooo small compared to the pic's and the sound was so soft, it was hard to hear it if anything else was going on.Would of like to returned it!"
4,Loved the noises,The child and even some adults loved playing with the item. The child will have fun trying to duplicate the results being demonstrated by the adults.
1,SAFETY HAZARD: CHOKING,"My 2-year old received this for Christmas. Within the first 5 minutes, he scraped his little teeth over the front ambulance metallic bump. It came right off and was in his mouth. Because I was right next to him, I got it out. I emailed directly to Melissa and Doug, but I never heard anything back from them."
3,Kind of cool...,"I bought this toy for my 19 month old and its a good concept and he LOVES vehicles so that's a bonus BUT melissa & doug kind of failed on the design I think. The speaker that makes the noise is underneath the toy so it sounds really muffled and quiet. If they'd put the speaker on the side it would have been great, but they didn't so it just doesn't sound good.Otherwise though, my son enjoys it."
4,"Great toy, I just wish it was larger","I purchased this toy for my son and although the toy is the same great quality we have come to expect from Melissa and Doug, the blocks are a little small."
1,"A big, fat zero.","We got one of these as a gift, and it was a total failure. The ""Vehicle Sound Block"" toy is supposed to make the sounds of the vehicles when the blocks are lined up correctly. We got the batteries in, but the toy simply didn't work. No sound, no nothin.' We also were given one of their farm sound puzzle toys and couldn't get the back panel for the batteries to open. Tried using a small philips screwdriver, a safety pin, etc., and it simply would not open. The lack of sound was disappointing, though our child still liked the pretty puzzle. This company seems to do well with plain wood toys, but when they branch out into electronics, the products are fairly shoddy. I plan to avoid their products in the future."
2,Poorly constructed,"I usually love Melissa and Doug, but these blocks are below their usual standards. The pictures are warping. Was disappointed with the quality of the sounds. Both the blocks and the base are heavy so if your child is into throwing things I wouldn't buy this for safety reasons."
3,"Love the concept, but M & D toys are CHEAP QUALITY!!!","I have the farm sound blocks. I love the concept of these toys. My 12 month old son likes to play with it now that he is older and can grasp these huge sized blocks. (Originally bought it when he was 8 months). I wanted to purchase the vehicles ones as well, but the quality is so CHEAP, it's practically a choking hazard!!! My son has chewed off chunks of the cheap stickers that make up the design on the blocks. I have to supervise him when he is playing with this toy. The cheap wood is also splintering at the edges from his abrasive saliva and baby handling...Overall I would recommend buying the vehicle one (since there aren't a lot of alternative better-quality options out there) but would purchase an animal alternative from a brand more durable and more worth the money like from Imagiplay. With M&D;, you get what you pay for and it's usually not worth it."
2,"I love Daft Punk as musicians, but this film does not work for me","Visually stunning, but nothing more. A 73 minute story that should have been told in 30-40 minutes (at most).If Daft Punk's intention was to create an unyielding sense of boredom within my soul, they got this film right, but I do not believe that is their intention. I would not recommend this film to a friend."
1,I would rate lower if i could,"I had heard this movie was bad before seeing it. I had heard about how during the PREMIERE at Cannes, the majority of the audience LEFT during the middle of the movie. All these people hated this movie, but not me, no, I was going to enjoy it. I'm a big Daft Punk fan why wouldn't I?Because it's crap. I love these guys' music, and normall they're video work, but this is horrible. You could take all the entertaining aspects of this film and roll them into a 1 minute movie. That would be worth it, but as is, steer clear. I'd say all in all this movie is a big joke on us the consumer for wasting our time on it. Anybody that tells you it's good is just trying to look like a hipster.EXAMPLE:One scene the shot is zoomed out super far in the middle of the desert. We sit in silence, as the guy walks from the right to the left of the screen. It literally takes 30 minutes to happen. Not an isolated incident."
4,A true work of art,"You will hear very mixed reviews on this, so I am going to try not to say anything along the lines of ""it sucked"" or ""it was amazing"". The movie starts off realy slow and I felt really stupid for buying it. As I continued to watch it, I found myself in love with it. Basically, you are watching what was ment to be a music video for HUMAN AFTER ALL. There is no dialouge, only beautiful scenery, beautiful photography, and a really nice story. None of the music is Dafts, but this music fits the movie very well. For the nice booklet, the awesome case, and interesting visuals, its worth it."
2,Did I watch the same movie?,"The only reason I did not stop it and move on was because all the raving reviews made me wait for something phenomenal to happen. It did not.I gave it two starts because has effort, heart and that flavor of entrepreneurship that we all love to see when we sit through a play written and acted by our kids. Kudos on creating something original on no budget.As a movie it is awkward, poorly acted (the little girl has potential though) and predictable.Yes, it is entertaining in that high school play kind of way."
1,Truly dreadful,"The movie is poor in every sense but what is truly dreadful is that someone has stuffed the reviews to make it look like an extraordinary film. Like most people, I guess, I actually look at the reviews before buying or renting a film. The 5 star reviews of this film are so out of touch with the reality of the product that it makes me begin to question the validity of having buyers write reviews that are then sent in. This film is amateurish from beginning to end. I would not recommend it to anyone and hope that prospective buyers read this so as not to be suckered into wasting money on buying this turkey. If you bother to take the time and check the 5 star reviews, you will quickly see that the only thing most of these reviewers have ever reviewed is this movie. Really doesn't it make you wonder just a little bit that someone may be trying ""to stuff the ballot box"" on this one."
1,Buyer beware!,"Obviously the producers of this film flooded the review section with 5 star reviews when it was released. Looks like a porn that never gets to the good part. A very cynical attempt to make a buck in my opinion. I guess I'm a sucker for renting it. Shame on Amazon, though, for putting all this garbage up for rent on Roku. Buyer beware!"
1,THIS IS A DESASTER,"The movie is not a movie, it doesn't have any action what so ever and the actors were dumped from a cheap porno set.Thank you,"
1,Do not BUY or RENT,"Bad movie, nothing good to say about it. Try spending your time better, such as watching paint dry."
2,it was.... OK,it's a basic old cartoon every episode has the same plot: a monster comes the earth defence force trys to fight it then the main charitor turns into ulraman beats up the monster and saves the day
3,Not an Opera DVD,"This DVD has a recording of a puppet-show version of this. I bought this not knowing that it was not a staged production and was sad to find that it was not. Pilar Lorengar is one of the most over-looked sopranos of all time. This DVD, although it does not have a stage production, has a wonderful musical production of this opera. You can buy just the CD of this performance on Amazon and I highly recommend it."
5,Beautiful Seahorse Pendant,"I purchased this gift as a graduation gift. It came in a wooden box, carefully packed and there was no need for gift wrapping. Great price and fast delivery."
2,complete waste,I wasted my time and money with this product. I found it more difficult to apply the stockings with this product than with just my hands. The service was prompt. But I found the product useless.
5,Reasonable Access Guide,"I felt a previous review of this book was quite unfair so I thought I would add my two cents. I think this is a good book *for* developers. It has reasonable coverage of most topics in Access and it avoids the ""greatest hits"" syndrome that many Complete Reference guides seem to have. If you develop Access databases and are a programmer, this makes a good reference book."
2,Another Endless Book on Access,"Here it is, guys and gals, the first in the predictable series of useless books on the latest version of Microsoft Access. Once again, we're shovel-fed over a thousand pages of 'information.' Lots of it is useless, period, and MOST of it the sort of thing that nobody who might need to buy this book would ever actually use. I found this book to be as frustrating as I expected it to be, even tho a programmer buddy recommended the author. It's probably great for someone like him, but I wouldn't know. For a businessman, it was a total waste of time."
4,a bargain collection for London fans!,"This 3-disc set is exceptional value for Julie London fans, comprising tracks from the early years of her recording career, through the Liberty singles as well as her Capitol recordings.Julie London's sultry, come-hither vocal delivery is evident throughout such numbers as ""'Round Midnight"", ""When I Fall in Love"", ""In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning"", ""Hot Toddy"" and ""I Got it Bad"". There are also fun numbers like ""Give a Little Whistle"" and ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"".Julie London was her own worst enemy when it came to her musical career; she never felt that her voice was special, nor did she think her overall musicality as good as other jazz singers of the period. While she did have some healthy competition from such singers as June Christy, Rosemary Clooney and Peggy Lee, Ms London managed to hold her own, garnered a legion of devoted fans, and recorded many chart albums.A fantastic gift for the Julie London fan in your house![EMI Gold 0946 3 67270 2 8]"
4,Julie London Ultimate Collection CD,All information was given and I understood what I was purchasingWith CDs it is always difficult to know just how well made the recording will beThis recording was of a good standard especially considering the age of the original recordingsGood value there are three CDs in this collection
5,Great voice from the past,This artist is a joy to listen to. She has brought the music of the past to a new audience. Great CD set.
5,A book as steamy as it's locale.......,"This book was terrific, Ms. Cameron's best to date. Not only was the romance hot and fast but the mystery plot had enough twists and angles to satisfy most any reader. I was glad that Ms. Cameron used a harder edge for her debut hardcover than she usually uses for her paperbacks. Well done!Ree-views"
2,Not recommended.,"I'm a huge fan of contemporary romantic thrillers, but this book dragged from page 1! I kept finding something else to do & had to force myself to finish this. The basic plot was good, the rapport not so hot, & the 'action' jumped like an erratic phonograph needle. The mobsters were totally unrealistic. There were just way too many elements thrown together that the story lost its impact. I want the bad guys to be really bad & the good guys to have great chemistry. Nora Roberts (aka J.D. Robb), Tami Hoag, Linda Howard & Catherine Coulter's contemporaries are much better."
2,Disappointing & formulaic,"I'm willing to suspend belief (especially with romance novels), but this one asks way too much of the reader. The characters are cartoonishly drawn, stereotypical romance novel fodder. Conversations between the hero and heroine go on, and on, and ON, with the author interjecting periodically that oh, by the way, they really do hate each other - or think they do (wink, wink). One other nitpicking point: the murder at the beginning of the novel is described in one scene as 'grizzly.' Uh... I think you mean 'grisly.' This novel seemed like a rush job all around."
3,too complex and weird,"I have read other Stella Cameron books and enjoyed them, but this one was a little too much with too many complications! The mob, rape, politics, murder mystery, journalism, etc. are just too much in this storyline. It makes interesting reading, but then the hero, Jack, has to be a storytelling father to a daughter named Amelia??? Come on! Overall, interesting reading, but her other works are better."
4,A great addition to your Christmas season!,I love stories that dig through the superficiality and commercialism of Christmas and get to the heart of what really happened one silent night. This book does that! The stories in this book will take you to mountaintops and valleys and into the hearts of 17 women. The birth of a king is the connecting thread in all their journeys. This book is multi-generational so grandmothers as well as teenagers will want to read this. There's a CD that goes with it that's wonderful too....a nice gift package for someone!
4,"Parenting speaker/author says, ""Not just for Christmas""","A beautiful cover and beautiful content. One Silent Night is a collection of inspirational stories by women. Some are very eloquent and some simple. I found lessons and wisdom in the stories. As a speaker to parents with young children I was attracted to the story of ""Deborah"" in prison and thought her insights were valuable. This book would make a meaningful gift all year long!"
4,Great pre-intermediate tape.,"Lilias provides complete instruction at a relaxed pace. This tape uses some of the basic poses for a complete all-body workout. One thing that impresses me is her need not to impress me with a bunch of advanced poses or other self agrandizing promotion, as I have seen elsewhere."
1,"Not bad mellow carribean, but...","The songs were ok, but it's only 15 minutes long. Not worth the cost.."
2,Iffy...,"I find some of Naugle's uses of ""worldview"" are questionable, to say the least. Philosophers explain that because a culture has a certain WORD - like ""worldview"" - it does not follow that it has the corresponding CONCEPT. Intellectual history is good but one must use caution when doing these types of philological (and don't be fooled - this is more philology than philosophy), studies.Also, on an apologetic note - Calvinistic fideism is the rule in this book and it finally collapses into subjectivism (he tries to avoid it in a footnote in chapter one, unsuccessfully). If you have any evidentialist tendendcies, you won't find anything here. When all is said and done all he can say (and does say) is that theists and, say, 'non-theists,' just have different beliefes (shrug shoulders and walk away scratching head); that is what it amounts to.Two stars because it is interesting in some ways, just take with a large degree of healthy skepticism if you are an objectivist."
3,Good CD for fans of Phil Collins,"I bought this disc mainly for the song,""I Don't Care Anymore"",which leads off the album and which I didn't previously have in my collection(unfortunately,it's not included on his ""Hits"" collection).The only other song that I recognized when looking at the titles was Collins' version of ""You Can't Hurry Love"".Upon listening to the CD,I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the song,""It Don't Matter To Me"",because I remembered hearing it on the radio years ago.I love it when CDs surprise me like that.While this disc is not as hit-laden as his later album,""No Jacket Required"",it is worthwhile for filling in the gaps left by his ""Hits"" collection.To date,there is not one thoroughly complete collection of Phil Collins' solo music on the market and this is a shame.I strongly feel that he deserves the box set treatment.Oh well.Maybe someday."
4,Great tunes,"I originially bought the CD for the single,""I don't care, anymore,"" and to see what else he might have created.While hooked on the lead song, I am now also hooked on the entire CD,being continually amazed that a drummer could create all that he does."
2,Hello I Must be Going,"For the first time in ordering on Amazon I was very disappointed with a CD that I purchased. The CD is not in the best condition, which is counter to the description that I read. Admitedly, it is used, but not in the condition it should have been.I would have returned the CD, but I didn't realize how scratched up it was until after I had it for a while and I had already thrown all of the packaging, etc. away. Not all of the artwork was with the CD -- the back art was missing."
5,hello I must be phil,this cd was worth the wait what else can be said about phil collins with songs like I dont care anymore you cant hurry love but my favorites are I cant beleve it's you and do you know do you care which has a very erie beat and feel to it the song seems to be about one of his wives cheating on him and the emotion is felt in this song a very good buy
5,Close to Perfect,I remember listening to this album as a young boy and playing it so hard that my tape broke. I just got the CD and the baby seems to really like it. 'Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart' is a classic song right up there with Billy Joel's 'Piano Man' and Elton John's 'Your Song'. This album deserves a second listen. I am so happy I ordered the CD last month.
1,Lousy product,Was expecting a lot more from a US product. Scratches my bike frame and is super difficult to install and position. No clear instructions on the position of fitting this thing. Overpriced for something of this quality.I was going to rate it 0 star but I can't.
2,Has never worked..?,"Installed this after I schleck 'd it super hard in a race.Honestly has never done anything for me. I still drop the chain occasionally, and it just goes right by. I installed as directed, but it needs more grip. The chain just pushes it out of the way."
5,LETTERS FROM A LIVING DEAD MAN,"This is a timeless classic. It was originally published nearly a hundred years ago, but its message is as fresh as tomorrow. No other book has had such a profound effect on me. In it, Judge Hatch writes through the hand of Elsa Barker of his adventures in the after life following his death. I have loaned copies of the original to friends and family for years. Now, finally, it is available once again at a reasonable price."
5,3do completes a good game,this game was pretty cool.it was ful of action and has 15 fun levels.I recomend this game to anyone who likes action packed games.so get it!!
4,nice product,This is a good product. It certainly provides help and comfort for nagging achilles tendinitis. The only negative is it is rather expensive.
3,better han nothing,"I tried this and it was ok when the achilles tendon was severely tender but after it got a little better it wasn't of much use. Even though it's tight enough that it's difficult to get on and off, it's not snug enough to give support or do the massage that they say it will. kind of expensive for what i got out of it"
1,doesn't fit,"used their sizing chart. I have tree trunks for legs, so things like this don't often fit me. will go back to DonJoy braces."
2,Dashed hopes,"I had really high hopes for this product, since I am suffering with a nasty achilles issue, and I read about this product on well-respected, neutral blogs specific to sports medicine. However, the support gave me a serious gash where the skin was rubbed away at the ""intersection"" of my foot and shin where the material rubs with each foot strike I take. And more importantly, the product did not help the ache or pain of my injury. After a few miles in fact, I felt a mild pain radiate up the leg into my glutes. I will return this overpriced support product."
1,Poor service,"There was a discount for this item, so I ordered it. After I paid, I got an email stating that there is no discount and I canceled my order. Waste of time!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I really thought I will be able to see the band in action.. instead you get 5 guys who keep coming in to give their criticism or opinions..At the end of the DVD session, I felt like tthrowing it in the bin. I would at least would have appreciated at least one song played full. Who needs their opinions.. I know deep Purple.. I don't need the 5 individuals giving me their opinions. The music world have its ups and down. no matter what .. these musicians have given us their work. appreciate and enjoy."
1,Don't waste your money. This one is a real turkey.,"What a disappointment. I thought that this DVD would be the concert version of the Made in Japan album (CD). Instead, the first 35 minutes (of a 60 minute DVD) are a summary of all the albums of Deep Purple Mark II that lead up to the Made in Japan album. When the four narrators finally get around to discussing the Made in Japan album, they use concert footage from previous concerts (filmed in the US, Germany, and elsewhere) to illustrate their point about a certain song. The only Japanese footage included in this marginal DVD are a few cutaways of the Japanese crowd at a concert. And we don't really know if this footage is from the Deep Purple concert! Except for these few crowd shots, THERE IS NO CONCERT FOOTAGE OF DEEP PURPLE'S CONCERTS IN JAPAN ON THIS DVD. I would have given this DVD zero stars, but there is no mechanism on this review in which to do so."
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!!,Talk about a con job. This dvd is garbage! All this waste of money dvd does is make you mad that you bought it. It's a few guys that I've never heard of talking about how Deep Purple are this or that. This dvd will be thrown in the garbage very soon. After I use it for awhile as a coaster for my beer I'll maybe take it outside in the backyard and have some target practice with my bb gun just to relieve some frustration.The sad thing is I was so exicited thinking I was getting Made in Japan on dvd.
2,Ok for normal curly hair.,This is a good shampo if you don't color your hair. It didn't moisturize my hair enough and left it frizzy.
4,Fun Game,"This game is great fun and I liked it very much. A good strategy game. It has a short play time (which is good for me), and is fun to play with small or larger groups. Only downside is the instructions are a bit dense for quick play, but once you get into the game it makes sense. I recommend this game."
2,Bad Remastering Offers No Improvment Over Original Verson,"I was looking forward to hearing this remaster ever since I heard it was being released. Imagine my disappointment when I popped this in my stereo and heard no disearnable difference between the new ""remastered"" version and the original. If it wasn't for the excellent second disc of extra tracks (that sounds more remastered than the first disc), I would have asked for a full refund. I can only recommend this release to anyone who wants the second disc."
4,One of the vital album from a NOT mainstream band !!!,"The album the represents heavy metal music in early 80's. "" The Price "" is on of the classics example."
5,twisted sisters moment in the sun,"this album originally came out at the height of the hair band era in 1984.and as far as im concerned,it stands the test of time quite well.featuring such anthems as ""we're not gonna take it"" and 'i wanna rock""this album truly stands out in an era that was flooded with many now classic metal albums.disc 2 of this 25th anniversary re-release is comprised of tracks that didnt make it onto the original release,some unfinished demos,and one brand new track called ""30"" (the first new TS track in over a decade)judging from this track,the band hasnt lost anything that they gained 25 years ago.wheether you're revisiting this album or listening for the first time,its definitely worth checking out."
1,RIP OFF!!!,"Dave Schultz, the person who allegedly re-mastered this disc, has created a ""sonic disaster""!!! He should personally give us all a refund. Dude must have needed some beer money! This easily beats the injustice done to Cheap Trick's ""Dream Police"" re-master. DO NOT BUY THIS PRESSING!!"
2,I wanna pop?,"For a long time this album was very embarrassing, but as time has gone by I must admit that songs like ""We're not gonna take it"" and ""I wanna rock"" sure has something appealing. It's hard to take Twisted Sister serious (just look at the album cover) and I like to think that Dee Snider & Co themselves laughed at the whole thing.The album is rather uneven in my opinion. The best song is without doubt the title track ""Stay hungry"". By the time of the release this was (light) heavy metal and I'm pretty sure that the once who find this album enjoyable are mostly ""older"" people who grow up with Twisted Sister among others. Youngsters may say: ""what the f**k is this?"""
2,"""I Wanna Rock!!""","If you ever need a real good laugh, pull this album out!! You will think ""Was I ever this young?"" Remember in the movie ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" they were filming the video for ""Burn in Hell."" Now even Pee Wee won't give them the time of day. Next!!"
4,Really cute sandals,I've wanted these since I first saw them in a Macy's circular. They are really cute and quite comfortable. I'm not too keen on the gold band that goes in between the toes. But I still like them over all.
3,Silk the Shocker and Mya,"I love this song. It has a good beat and Mya sings very well in it. However, Silk the Shocker (with his fine self) goes all out on the lyrics. This song alone made me buy the CD. It's hot!"
4,Nice,"It's nice to see a rapper finally admit his loneliness and plead for somebody--anybody!--to like him. It's touching to hear him cry for people to just accept him for who he is, a sweet gentle boy who dotes on his mummy, and not the grunting posturing ""thug"" persona he has adopted for public performance (because it is so remunerative).I hear your cry, Silky, and my heart responds with deep sympathy for your repressed longing. I understand. And I like you...for who you truly are. I really do."
4,Silkk & Mya makin' it hot!,"I've read all of the comments written by the other customers, and I have something to say about their comments. Most of them are very disrespectful towards Mya. She is a very talented singer. The single would not be what it is without Mya's vocals. I think no one else could replace Mya on that single, personally I think Mya & Silkk are a perfect combination, so stop hatin'!"
3,It's Aight,I mean the song ain't complete trash..it's straight though i mean you could have picked another singer other than Mya cuz she can't really sing...
2,WRONG R&B SINGER SILKK!!!!,This song would've been better if another R&B singer was featured. MYA CAN'T SING FOR NUTTIN!!!!
5,Solid Text,This is clearly one of Prentice Hall's better efforts. The material in this book is so well developed that it can be used as an additional reference during a precalc course for the algebra element.Examples are color-coded to show steps. There are lots of sample problems included. The only drawback to this book is the large amounts of photos and drawings that aren't necessary--but these are present in this entire series of math books.The glossary is a big bonus. Not all math texts have a glossary as nice as this one.
3,You can do better,"This book is an interesting combination of styles... It's not a tutorial book and it's not a gallery of pretty pictures either. It actually comes across more like a promotional pamphlet than anything else. The book will show a picture illustrating a feature of Maya, then explain the benefits of the feature in general terms, and occasionally give a hint about how to actually use the feature in the software. It's probably too general to be of much use to a Maya beginner (or at least there are better books for beginners) but it does give a pretty nice overview of computer graphics concepts in general. Seasoned Maya users certainly won't find much use for the book (try the Killer Tips book for a similar feel but more useful information) though the last 20 pages of the book contain some interesting tales about how Maya is used by the professionals. This certainly isn't a bad book; it just seems to go in too many directions and tries to cover too many topics in too little space."
2,The Art of Maya: An Introduction to 3D Computer Graphics,"It is always the same thing that in other editions. When you will stop to copy and to put something new.The covers and the works of the experts in 3D, are perfect. The price is also something expensive, being the same thing that in previous editions. I Offer you that you can be but original. Thank you and a cordial greeting."
4,"Graphics, ok. Adictive, hell ya! Fun... kinda.","I really liked BURNOUT, especially the graphics. But the fact that you're always timed and rushing to the next checkpoint, it's like you never get enough time to even play. Before you get into it, your time runs out. On the other side, that game is pretty fun. The awsome and realistic crashes, good graphics, and cool cars. Plus, this game can be very adictive. Never buy it for more than it's worth if you find it for over $... anywhere, don't buy it."
3,In the BLINK of an EYE...!,"This is a cool game. All racing fans out there, you gotta buy this game. This is fast and fun and the crashes are cool. Real car damage and the graphics are cool. This game...ROCKS!!!BUT, it's not as cool as other racing games, can't control the first replay, no camera views and no slow-motion, saving the replay, just only the crash and no replay in 2-player mode."
1,every game comes so close but one thing messes it up,i liked most every thing about this game. cars are cool tracks are rad. but every time you crash you loose controle of the car.the car stops and it shows you the wreck from 3 different camra angles. it is cool the first time but it takes about 10 sec for every crash. in other good games like gta3 half the fun of the wrecks is driving out of them on two wheels or rolling the car and still trying to power out of it. if this game let you keep driving when you get in a crash i would go buy it tomarow. but it is to frustrating to play. so i will take it back before my five days is up. it just makes me mad
2,"Im Tired of Company reps writing their own ""reviews""","There's no way this game can be considered as good as many of these reviews. Either these positive reviews are made by company reps, or the person just doesnt have any experience with other, more advanced games. Either way, they need to find a better way to screen out these obvious ""OFF THE MARK"" reviews"
3,Good but not exciting!,"Burnout is a great game but you're not actually destroying cars like if you crash into the car, the money is for dameage unlike the points you get. If you want a really exciting and crushing cars game, you should either get Burnout 3 or Burnout Revenge."
1,This game (***) dont even rent it !,"I like racing games, but this is probably the worst racing game I have ever played. First you cant wreck and keep on going.It stops and shows you a bunch of (***). Also it charges you a hundred thousand dollars for a dent in your car. You also cant go fast I had a viper and I maxed out at 130 mph. And another thing there are these big green arrows that show you which way to go. You cant go in reverse or a big red wall comes out from nowhere and stops you. If you like not wrecking, driving slow, and spending money than this game is perfect for you."
2,Nothing compared to Burnout 2.,I did not like this game at all. However I love the sequel Burnout 2. I suggest you avoid this one and play 2 instead. End of story.
5,GREAT GAME!!!,me and my brother rented burnout . it is a cool game. you can run people off the roads and dent cars. you also get cash for making crashes! i think you shouod try this game.
2,Review of Burnout,This is another game that leaves much to be desired. The graphics are very PSone like and the gameplay lacks any real substance. You race past cars trying to get near misses and by doing so you fill up your burnout meter. Once your burnout meter is full you can go to supersonic speed whitch doesnt look or feel any different than when you were going normal speed. The near misses get to be very boring after a while. And there are not enough cars or tracks available. The racing to get to the next ckeckpoint is a little to arcade-like. The good thing about this game is that the steering and control are very tight. Bottom line rent it don't buy it. Buy GT3. That's it from me. I'm out :)
1,WORST GAME EVER,"This game is quite possibly the worst I have played on the PS2 yet. The instant-crash replay garbage is just anoying, the graphics are not all that great, and it has very little replay value. Don't waste your money on this game, get something else."
1,TWO WORDS.....DONT BUY!,I BOUGHT THIS GAME AND RETURNED IT AN HOUR LATER. THE BOX MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR GETTIN THE MOST REALISTIC CRASHING GAME EVER MADE....BUT IN FACT ITS THE WORST..IF YOU WANT REALISTIC CRASHING GO BUY GRAND THEFT AUTO 3.ITS 10 TIMES BETTER. BASICALLY BURNOUT IS JUST ANOTHER RACING CLONE. NOT EVEN WORTH RENTING..NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE ON HERE GIVE IT 5 STARS.THEY PROBABLY NEVER PLAYED A RACING GAME IN THIER LIFE AND IT WAS THIER 1ST EXPERIENCE. SAVE YOUR MONEY IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY. LAYTA
5,Is that light red?,"Burnout rules. This was a nice surprise. I hadn't heard anything about this game until a friend showed it to me. He said it was the best racing game out there, so I had to ask the question. What about Gran Turismo? He said forget the graphics, just try it. Well I did and I have been playing it every day since. He was right, just turn down the music and turn up all of the other sounds. You don't miss the music when you hear the sound of your body crashing through the windshield at 150 mph. I've never seen a racing game like this that really makes you feel like your going that fast. The crashes are what makes this game. My friends and I noticed that just before we hit something we are actually ducking our heads and closing our eyes. Its that real, I kid you not. I love my GT3, but I think this one is more fun. Don't forget to select Dolby Surround Sound, you'll really hear it when you enter the tunnels. 3.2.1. GO"
3,Great Rental,"So you see burnout's adds and you think 'Wow' and you rush out and rent it and sit down to play. You start it up and play for about 45 minutes with a slack-jawed, awe struck look on your face, but then it stops. You suddenly realise that you can have fun racing and crashing but only for so long, it lacks corperate sponsership, thus generic car models and it's rather redundent, after you race a few times, the rest of the maps are pretty much the same map backwards and at night.In the end: Great Idea, Great Graphics, Great Soundtrack, Poor exectuion. Unless your a hardcore racing fan of old school style racing, RENT THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!!"
4,"Shock-horror, GT3 fan likes Burnout!","Maybe I'm an exception but people who say that good reviews for this game must have no experience of other driving games are seriously wrong. Having got 96 point something percent through GT3 and completed all the main missions in GTA3 I bought Burnout on a recommendation from a friend. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed, true it's a little short (by no means as bad a MGS2) but I feel it has high replay value. Even now I turn the stereo on (Burnout's music is about the lowest point) and sit down to do a couple of races when I have some spare time. The game is all about gameplay and who cares if the graphics aren't upto scratch compared to GT3, you're flying through city streets dodging traffic like a cat on speed. One reviewer mentioned that the manual is lying about being able to drive a truck, it's not; sometime after completing the 3rd or 4th championship the oppurtunity occurs. In total I have aquired a total of 7 cars so far and there may be more."
1,DON'T GET IT,Three words: DON'T GET IT. I thought it was going to be awsom. after i played it i figuerd out it wasn't. Burnout 2 is a whole lot beter. get it insted. :)
1,Burnout stupid,worst game i have ever played it is like playing with a radio shack remote control rc when your 35
3,PHILADELPHIA IS FAR FROM NY,"The Philadelphia Kennel Club presents its annual show. The DVD is OK. That's it. I mean, there's nothing to be excited about. You can watch it and enjoy. It won't be remembered the next hundred years."
2,Good for First-timers,"If you're a first-timer to Paris, this map may be a good purchase. It notes the major sights and even suggests restaurants & bars, tips, sightseeing, and walks. However the map is not complete in any way. It doesn't give a complete map of the Montmartre or the metro and basically is only a map of the major sights along the Seine. It's compact, which is very handy and was what I was looking for. But if you want a more complete map that even shows some of Saint-Denis, some of the Bois de Boulogne, and is just slightly larger but just as portable; go with the Michelin Paris Poche #50. Which also has complete versions of the metro, RER, & bus lines."
4,Good product but I wish it was cheaper,"With shipping, I paid $27 for this. I looked online for a long time and couldn't find any place that sells this for less. The product itself is great. I purchased the small cotton one when my son was first born. Then switched to the medium fleece in the winter. Now he is using this cotton one for the summer. The material is durable after many washes. The zipper works great. No parts sticking out that would scratch the face. And I like this car print. I just wish that it was cheaper."
3,no information description,"I was interested in this socket set , but when I needed to know the size range.... there was none. Whats up with that. Seems simple to me."
5,Nice set,"I bought this set to work on my two cars. I like the set so far - it is sturdy built and worked no problem on all tough/rusted nuts I tried so far, including 21mm on struts. For those looking for the size, the set includes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,24 mm sockets. Basically, everything between 9-24mm."
3,Not worth it.,"I would not consider paying over $20.00 or this set. If you can find it cheaper and love the Doors, it is worth a listen. This is not something you would listen to multiple times. I bought mine, listened once, and sold it on ebay(and I love the Doors). Get their collector's dvd for a better value."
3,Falling off the balcony,"The Balcony is a brilliant play emulating similar satirical methods of the better known ""Crucible."" The Balcony is at times sexy, witty, violent, gauche, and shocking. The movie does not succeed in relating the power of the tale. Nonetheless, Jean Genet's superb screenplay is not completely lost on the mature viewer. Younger or less analytical viewers may have problems with the nuances of the play, yet the advantage of the movie is the ease with which it can be watched again for further comprehension. Overall, while the movie is certainly good, it does not do the play nor playwright justice."
1,disgusting at best,"This has got to be the most disgusting movie I've seen (ever). At least I got this at the library, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't buy this, or I'd be fuming. It is just weird and frankly no entertainment whatsoever. For anyone to give this a higher rating than one, I'd hate to see that person (and wouldn't want my kids around that person!) I want to give this movie a minus 5. SAVE your money! I have only seen the first half hour of this movie, 'cause that was enough of my time wasted on garbage."
4,Better wait,"Good value if you get the lower price. This was recently as low as 11.99, as were most of the 50 packs. It then jumped to 26.99. Wait for it to go back down."
5,Love it,"I bought this just for ""Road to Bali"" but I've enjoyed a few others. It is worth the price if you like even one of the films! I'm not a huge fan of the earlier stuff but I've enjoyed being exposed to it through this collection. I am very happy I got it. Thank you!"
2,Not worth getting!!!,They show Bob Hope and all the guys that we remember but most of the movies are people that you don't remember at all. If the stars are in the movies they are the first movies where they had bit parts. I was very disappointed in this set and would not waste money on them if you want the comdey kings buy them by Stars name. Sorry I bought them!
5,Remembering past joys and toys,"Just spend a few minutes with this book and you will jump back to the day. Your first quest will be to find the toys you played with. This is extremely easy to do as the book is laid out in chronological order. I enjoyed looking at the pictures and write ups of the toys of my youth. Some I looked for purposely and others became a surprise reminder of things I had forgotten. The simple pleasure of remembering these things was added to by the stories about how the toys came to be, their inventors, and manufacturers. I have enjoyed this book so far, having only had it for a week or so. I imagine it will give me hours of reminiscing. I also want to go through it with my family and friends and let them tell me about their toys. Overall review would be a top quality book that can be enjoyed by children of all ages."
5,Nostalgia to share!,"I picked up this book at a store and could have spent a couple of hours taking a trip down ""memory lane"". It was fun to see games that I currently play with my 5 year old nephew here with great pictures of the original box, board and tokens. It would also be a fun book to share with parents, grandparents and enjoy the twists and turns some of our favorite games and toys have taken over the years. Perfect for those who love trivia, pop-history and just saying, ""Remember when..."""
4,Trump should stick to business not politics!,"In a year when people like Warren Beatty want to run for president, Pat Buchanan has switched parties and Jesse Ventura has become the talk of politics, it is no coincidence that Donald Trump has written this book.The America We Deserve is Trump's attempt to show that he has what it takes to make the ""American Dream"" become the White House battle cry. The problem is, with no political background his arguments are weak.Trump is using an out of control political system to play upon the political ignorance of the American people in order to gain enough popularity to win the highest office in the land.While the book is well written and Trump does make serious points about his ambitions, he fails to be convincing that he has what it takes. Overall it was a pleasant read, but Trump needs to stick to books about business and leave politics to the experts."
1,What I think about this book,"This book really wasn't the kind of subject that I'm into. It's real political but I do agree that Trump would make a good president, because of how bold and creative he is. If you like politics, you'll probably enjoy this book."
1,another dopey infomercial,"A total waste of money. A lot of blah blah blah by someone who has nothing to say and no credibility in saying it. Does anyone believe this guy about anything anymore? You do get the feeling he believes it, which is kind of pathetic. Save your money."
3,Item doesn't fit Tundra Double Cabs,"This is to inform that this item does not fit the 2004-2006 Tundra Double Cab models. It is for the Access Cab models only. I researched this information at the Westin manufacturers website and it states that the correct model for the double cab is the Westin 25-2400, which according to Amazon says it doesn't fit the Tundra D cab. I called Amazon's customer service and they were extremely nice and helpful with providing me a method to return the item back. I informed them that their website listing is wrong and hopefully they fix it. I am posting this to help any other person avoid this headache.Take the time review the Westin's website to make positive that the model you are ordering will fit your vehicle.A+ for Amazon's customer service."
2,Seems silly,I just couldn't get into using tapping often enough to know if it would make a difference long term. I've utilized things like acupuncture and acupressure and have felt relief from these things so in my mind believe that it's probably possible to get relief from tapping if it's used. I just never got into using it and felt silly when I did.
2,I wasted my money.,"I am an educated psych nurse, retired. Worked in mental health care settings for 20 years. Had a bout with depression during my child-bearing years. This book was recommended to me by my psychologist. I read it about half-way through. I followed the directions to the letter. I kept it up for as long as I could stand it. Maybe it helps some, but did nothing for me. This tapping business consists of you tapping on various spots on your head and face, mostly. I felt ridiculous and it did not help me. I put it far out of sight and chalked it up to you live and learn. I do not recommend it. But, of course you must decide what is best for you. ..Amazon has a great selection of books and you can get whatever you want to read. Judge Judi"
2,Disappointing,"This book did not resonate with me at all. I would have liked to seen more conclusive case studies over long periods of time and what the results were - either positive or negative. The limited case studies cited did not help to convice me that these methods truly work. I felt rushed reading the book, when in fact I wanted more details, more substance and more conclusive observations.I have read a lot of good books on energy medicine and unfortunately, this book was not one of them"
5,Energy Tapping,"This is a must have self-healing book for all who are tired of feeling bad, but not knowing how to stop all the memories that keep us this way. I found my copy at a local yard sale, and within minutes of beginning therapy, I felt my real self again and the rot of bad memories and experiences pealing off. One of the the best thing I've learned is the forgiveness tecnique of forgiving someone that had mad me 'angry'. Not just forgiving, per se, but having a contact target from base emotions(anger)to forgive.If anyone is having trouble with stumbling blocks to the real 'you', just try this truly life enhancing study. You'll not be sorry, just able to be glad and joyful at last, from with-in, not just some mask you might have to wear."
5,"well written, thorough, but with Windows NT bias","Hughes has written an excellent book. He explains the protocols and standards extremely well. Which is the diamond of this book. (i.e. why you should buy it.) But the implementation illustrations are mostly Windows NT with a mention of a UNIX counter part. He even explains how to install Microsoft DNS and Proxy. The NT explanation is like a double edged sword. If you know *NIX, all you will need is the P+S. Hughes points out how M$ has gone of the track of the standards and screwed up. (like how Exchange is a single file message store mail server incompatible with POP3 and SNMP) The cd-rom has the RFC documents created by the IETF. If you are looking for a book that explains the ins and outs of Internet e-mail without missing a pin-drop, this is the book for you. All the best!"
3,Decent book but overly biased towards Win NT,"I found the book fairly rudimentary but useful as an introduction to the components that make up the email system. The major disappointment arises from its NT-bias, as if the author was commissioned by Microsoft for the book's creation. I wish more authors can keep their personal biased opinions to their dinner tables and out of professional technical books. Phrases such as ""NT is such a fine platform for developing commercial-grade systems"" and ""even that final refuge of UNIX should fall within a couple of years"" simply do not conjure up impressions of objective professional writing. Sadly, I must add this sort of self-righteous writing is what contributes to the anti-Microsoft sentiments."
1,Removing the Spam : Email Processing and Filtering,"I'm a student so I want to looking for a technique a about JavaMail. If you can give me a book for free, I only use it for research. Thank you and look forward from you."
2,this game has much room for improvement.,"If you are thinking about getting this game for game boy advanced i strongly suggest that you don't. (I don't know if it's good for playstation 2 or not.) First off, graphics aren't amazing and the angle of the view is very awkward. Steering your player is also very hard because the controls odd. Another thing is it seems as though every level is the same and there isn't much variety in jumps. 3D0 could have done a lot better on this game!"
4,better than thier classic,"The first album ""Catholic Boy"" just isn't as good as this one. I don't care if it's a classic. Get this one if you like Jim Carroll but never really liked his music before."
2,Not what I thought it would be....,"I thought I liked this shampoo so I ordered a lot of it. I found after a few weeks of use, my hair felt greasy and as if I needed to find some way to clear it of this product. Maybe it's just my old hair, but it doesn't work for me. I have never used rinses or dyes."
3,Great Shampoo HORRIBLE Price,"I was in Canada for a few months this summer and I found this shampoo by a brand they have called Live Clean. It was EXACTLY the same as this shampoo and cost maybe 6 Canadian dollars for 12 oz. Ridiculous! This just goes to show how over priced nearly all beauty products are. Humph. :(This really is a great shampoo though. It makes my hair shiny and soft. I like to use it with a creamy moisturizing conditioner. Preferably something without parabens. In the mean time, I'm just going to try and find a source in the US for buying Live Clean. So far they only sell their baby products in the US. Such as:Live Clean Baby Soothing Relief Wash, 10 oz"
4,Works Great,"The bad is that this smells a little more like chemicals than I'd like, but it's not too bad. It just smells like a hair salon. The good is that it takes just a tiny amount to clean and it does a great job. I'll definitely buy more."
1,You should have stayed awake in chemistry class,"Nylon and polyethylene are not the same so far as I can remember from chemistry class. This item is described as being made of woven nylon, but when the package arrived it clearly says polyethylene. When used as a sun shade, nylon makes a pleasant, rustling sound like sails in the wind. Polyethylene makes a harsh, annoying, crackling sound. All I can say is I won't be ordering anything described as lingerie made of nylon for my wife from Amazon for fear of receiving a box of ziplock bags."
2,very very small roses,"This bracelet is very very small. A shame, as it is quite cute. You probably need a few to make an impact or use it with other rose bracelets or amber ones."
5,"If you love the movie, buy this CD","This movie is something of a cult thing anyway so it's not suprising that the people I know who like it as much as I do, have done things like buy a red Swingline stapler (made after the movie gained cult status) and want to listen to the songs on this which are NOT mainstream music. I mostly wanted it for the track, ""Shove this Jay-Oh-Bee"" but I also enjoy others like ""Damn it feels good to be a gangsta""."
4,This Soundtrack Kicks Ass,"The office space soundtrack is rippin'. Some Canibus and Ice T, this album really makes any work day cool. I have found that this cd is great to listen to in the car, just like Michael Bolton in the movie. I usually don't like soundtracks, but this one makes the cut."
2,ehhhhhh,"I didn't really enjoy this as much as I thought I would. I like the songs, but it's not the same as hearing them in the movie."
5,Office Space - The Motion Picture Soundtrack,"I'm not a big rap fan but, I really like this soundtrack. I loved the movie and the tunes were impressive. However, not for the young, due to language. But, the music is great. I keep it in my car all the time."
3,The real magic is in the movie,"Some of the songs on this soundtrack, such as Damn, It Feels Good To Be a Gangsta and No Tears are catchy, but the thing that really makes the album a winner is the movie. Everytime I hear one of the tracks on the album, I think of the scene in the movie where that song was played, and that's what makes this album good. If the songs didn't remind me of the movie, I doubt I'd like it much at all. I recommend buying this album, but only if you've seen the movie."
5,Damn It Feels GOOD!,"This soundtrack is amazing. Why? The best soundtracks can make you recall the exact scene they were playing behind, and even though these songs are so seemingly detached from this movie, every song will make you go ""Oh yeah!""And the best track of course is ""Damn It Feels Good To Be A Gangsta"" by the Geto Boys. I can't help feeling like life would be SO much better if ""Gangsta"" was always playing in the background.Ummmmmmm................... YEA-aaah...... (Bill Lumberg-style)"
4,Spiced up the movie!,"When I was about to watch Office Space, I was estimating that the movies music would just be a score. Man, was I wrong. The music first enters at the beginning of the movie, which as the movie went on, became more and more like the movie. What was the genre? Rap. Hip Hop. Yep. A movie about office nerds, you would expect something different. Well well, aint it a surprize? The music is great, especialy ""Damn it feels good to be a Gangsta"" which is a song that me and my friend Garret listen to, and love it.My Advice to you: SEE THE MOVIE FIRST. The soundtrack means nothing to you if you didnt see the film. Office Space is a laugh out loud comedy that popular person and nerd can enjoy. Any type of person will accept the movie and music which are both outstanding."
4,Not great but not bad...,"The negative reviewers make very good points, specially using eye gouges in less than life threatening situations, etc. All that notwithstanding, the book has very good information built on solid combatives and one can get quite a bit of worthy material from it. Like any guidebook, it cannot cover ALL possible scenarios. I take exception with the multiple elbows thrown as weapons. Their reach is short and I doubt the efficacy of them as opening or even secondary strikes. These are great and solid weapons when used in extreme short range.In closing, a pretty good addition to a serious combatives student's library."
1,REALLY REALLY BAD,"Fast Safe Reliable sent me TRASH from this address:F.S.R.PO BOX 11331Alexandria, VA 22311There is no other way to contact this company andd I am not the only one who has been ripped off by them."
1,THIS BOOK ISN'T 240 PAGES LONG!,Talk about blatant false advertisement. This book is 156 pages long!
4,The SAS know what they are doing,"The SAS are tough, and want to be alive after they completea mission. So, they should be great at writing a bookon self defense. In this case, it was mostly true. I thoughtthe book was excellent, but take it (the book) with a grainof salt. If you truly want to learn self defense, jointhe marines, or go to a dojo. Sparring with instructions froma book won't prepare you for the real life situation ofpanic, fear, and chaos.The reason why I give this book high marks is for that reason:Lofty wants you to focus more on avoiding the situation thanfighting in it. The first half of the book is devoted to avoidance. This is a book everyone should read... if you want tolearn more about fighting, get a 2nd book after this one.This is the start of learning self-defense, not the end all solution."
1,EKHO E-10 heart monitor never worked.,"EKHO E-10The time worked but the heart monitor never worked. I sent it in. They supposedly did the repairs. The same result as before -- the heart monitor never worked. Like a previous review, buy a more expensive heart monitor. I'm working on trying to get a refund."
3,Pretty good,"Of all of my Anthropology books over my four years of college, this was one of my least favorites. It was a good one, and well-written, but it was sometimes a little too dense. It depends on which chapter you read too; some of the chapters were really insightful, while others were a bit boring."
4,"Unique, lovely, and a bit uncomfortable","I really like the looks of my new ring, it is only one size and it doesn't stretch as you know it is glass. It is an eye catcher, but you will know it doesn't give you much comfort while wearing it, it a party ring, not a daily ring. This would make a great flashy present for anybody, it comes in a lovely box, and they wrapped it very delicatly and elegant presentation. The ring arrived very quickly too."
5,Laura you were great !!!,"It is a gorgeous album!! when it was release in 1983I bought it on cassette twice yesterday I got this album on cd on a local store it sounds better,what a shame she's not with usanymore.laura has been one of my favorite singers since the80's .LAURA THE BEST WAS YET TO COME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,More Branigan,"Laura Branigan's second album contained the top ten single ""Solitaire"" which peaked at number 7. The second single was ""How Am I Supposed to Live Without You"" which unfortunately helped unleash Michael Bolton on the world. Ms. Branigan version shows how to sing a song without the vocal histrionics of Mr. Bolton's version. The album also contains ""Deep In The Dark"", which is set to the music of Falco's ""Der Kommissar"" but has original lyrics. It's something of a ballad, but is weird when you hear the familiar ""Der Kommissar""."
4,A Booming Sound!,"Mixed with a combination of ballads, dance tunes, rock anthems, and euro-pop, this album has it all. Laura's second album showcases her talent vocally and spanned two top-ten hits. A great cd which makes you wonder what's next."
3,Only One Song Wanted,"I purchased this CD to acquire one song and only one song; Oh Happy Day by Don Howard. The song is extremely, almost impossible, to acquire in any other way except via download from a proprietary web site. In spite of my limited need for this CD, I nonetheless found it immensely entertaining due to its including so many old, old songs I listened to and enjoyed as a young man. Sometimes when you're searching for a small stone you luckily find a diamond. This was, for me, one of those times."
5,Pioneer Eco Bound Photo Album,"Possibly, as long as ten years ago, I purchased an Eco Photo Album to be used for my hunting photographs.A few weeks ago I discovered that I needed a new album and proceeded to Amazon.com.I immediately located a company that sold the very same album I purchased years ago, placed my order and later received the new album.It is very satisfying to discover, with the aid of Amazon.com, that a product you purchased and used successfully is still available many years later.Thanks Amazon.com! Keep up the good work!"
3,Not quite as described/shown,"If your reason for buying is the flexibility of image size, as mine was, think twice. The album set-up really does not allow for the long vertical photos shown in the display image. Instead, each side has three clar plastic pockets and when you attempt to insert a photo longer than one of the pockets, you have to tear the pocket away from the paper, taking a bit of paper with it, which then sits atop the image, making an unlovely display. Most everything else about this album is pretty nice.."
4,What I was looking for,"I took a chance that this would fit my 30 year old heater. Work's fine, fast shipping. I was a little dissapointed that it did not come with an installation wrench, more of a problem with getting the old one out than inserting the new. A little WD40 was a big help."
2,Very personal account of jazz.,"As much as I would like to rate this book more positvely I really can't. Not only do I find the author's tone very arrogant at times but because the book is supposed to be an introduction for new jazz lovers the highly personal tone and comments the author makes about certain jazz styles and musicians is very innapropriate. How can someone who turns to this book for help in understanding jazz, sort through the biases the author has towards certain artists if this is their first jazz reading? I'm also sorry to say that the book also appears to have not gone through a proof-reading...there are several (10+) spelling mistakes in the first chapter alone. I suggest you browse through it at your library rather than buy it."
2,"Interesting, but spotty.","Another in the seemingly endless series of ""...for Beginners"" books that began with a few Marxist tomes but later expanded into other areas. There are some useful bits and pieces here, but overall it's a rather narrow selection that spends too much time on the politics and history and not nearly enough on the music. Mingus is given a number of pages, and rightly so, given his stature as a composer and bassist- but there's not much about his music or why it's worth listening to. But where's Scott LaFaro? He was possibly even more influential than Mingus in redefining moden jazz bass playing, but there's nary a mention of him. There are too many omissions of this sort. Not one of the better books from this group, and not a good choice for someone interested in exploring jazz"
1,Doubt,I will NEVER do business with this seller again. I emailed them 4 times and they never had the courtesy to respond. The item never arrived and if I am charged for it I will dispute the charges. I guess this seller dosen't realize without us they wouldn't be in business.
1,Horrible,"Saw this at the theater after hearing all the hype, and unfortunately, that is an hour and a half of my life I will never get back. Nothing ever happens, nothing is resolved and the best part of it was when the credits rolled."
2,Waste of time,"I learned long ago that Academy Awards earned are not a good indicator of whether or not a movie is entertaining. Maybe this film is supposed to make you think, but all I could think about were things like ""I wonder if anything will ever happen"", and ""is this thing almost over?"" I will admit that the acting was superb, but wasted on this material."
2,Unbalanced & Stereotypic,"No review, but a couple of doubts.(1.) First, in the topically important subject of Father Flynn's conduct within his parish the audience should be presented with balanced arguments from both he and Sister Aloysius. Instead, we have a dominant/unbalanced presentation of the Sister's accusations over a weaker Father Flynn defense. That would be fine if the movie was entitled ""Gossip"". A more objective, albeit challenging movie would present the unfolding events as if to an omniscient audience and let us impartially decide guilt & innocence. In addition, the overindulgent & exaggerated acting only made it the more difficult to gleam the truth as to misconduct.(2.) Second, the movie perpetuates the stereotype of misconduct within religious orders as being near rampant (shared blame with the media) even though the actual percentage of misconduct may be 0.01% and not statistically different than many other professions or categories of interest."
2,Ultimately unsatisfying,"I admit I'm not a sophisticated movie critic. Far from it. But I know an unfulfilling movie when I see one. Although the acting was very well done, the ending of this movie was empty and left too much to the imagination. I don't mind books or movies that allow me to use some thought to fill in the blanks and decide for myself what happened, but this movie made me work way too hard. It left almost everything unanswered. At the end, I wanted some resolution, something that wrapped up the plot and gave meaning to what happened before, but instead it left it all up to the viewer to decide. It left me thinking, ""was that it?"""
2,"Good acting, but a really boring movie.","After all the praise this movie received I was surprised how much I disliked it. If you havent seen it, let me save you some time. (Spoiler alert)Nun: ""I think you touched a boy""Priest: ""I didnt touch a boy""Nun: ""I still think you touched a boy""Priest: ""I'm leaving this church""Nun: ""I'm not sure he touched a boy, boo hoo hoo...""The End.I've read the other reviews about how you need to re-watch it to see all of the subtle hints about whats REALLY going on(like the ballpoint pin on the floor?), but I paid attention during the movie and it all just seems to be lame attempts by the director to create an ominous mood; high winds, a storm, open windows, light bulbs going out, etc. Maybe I missed something, but I really did not like this movie. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life."
3,Okay Movie,"Doubt was an okay movie. Some parts were slightly tedious.Admittedly, there was perhaps one or two scenes that had a lot of strong feeling and done very well.It's one of those movies that you will watch once but you don't want to watch it over and over. It is definitely an unpredictable and unique movie and the actors did an incredible job. BubblesReviews.com Rating: 3 out of 5"
3,Hmmmm ...It's ok,"The performances were great but the pacing was a bit slow. People say it's thought provoking but I didn't feel that I learned anything new. The movie was ok. If you've read other reviews then you already know what this movie is all about: Basically, Philip Seymour Hoffman's character of sexual misconduct with at least one of his students. The ""evidence "" is flimsy at best but still Meryl Steep's character feels that she is correct in going after him. Philip Seymour Hoffman's says in the movie something to the effect of ""A feeling of certainty is not the same thing as fact."" Really? I could say the same thing to religious people...but I'm not going there. As I stated the performances were great and you feel for the characters but the title of the movie sort of lets you know how the movie ends: After all of Meryl Streep's claims of being certian and righteous in her actions it turns out that she has...that's right: ""Doubt""s."
2,I Doubt It,"Any film with P.S. Hoffman and M. Streep deserves a look. Next time I will be a bit more circumspect. This movie features superior acting and wonderful period authenticity. What it lacks, though, is an interesting story. Basically it's about a tormented nun/head mistresses whose creepy mind creates a totally baseless allegation against her immediate superior (Hoffman). Ultimately her warped sense of ""certainty"" is riddled with doubt. This is the first time I have seen a movie whose entire story was captured in the title! I found this flick to be trite but oddly viewable due to the great stars who tried valiantly to keep this non-event alive and moving."
5,Hooray for Sister Aloysius,"This is 1964, before anyone on the outside knew about the boys club in the Church which reassigned pedarasts from one parish to another and defended one another. Sister Aloysius is not loveable, but she is right. That sweet faced Father Flynn is a pedarast and she does what was necessary to get rid of him, but of course she couldn't really get rid of him. He was promoted by the boy's club. Forty-five years later we see the results."
3,Dubious,"Although exceedingly well acted, the plot is predictable and unsatisfying. Certainly, as in real life, we don't really know the ""truth"" and in that way the movie is true to its seeming intent. However, the Streep character is completely unsympathetic, without even a glimmer of humanity, whereas Hoffman's pederast priest is portrayed as a caring human being. Something is wrong here, and the political prejudices of the director detract from the integrity of what should be a fascinating discussion of some serious present day issues, framed in the context of the mid-sixties mores in which they had their beginnings.Doubt (movie tie-in edition)"
4,Very good but not Streep nor Hoffmans best,"I enjoyed this film yet found Streep and Hoffman's performances to be a little hindered. I can't explain why but I just couldn't empathize with their characters. They were not bad performances, but they didn't knock my sox off like Streep and Hoffmen usually do.A very very good film regardless."
5,You haven't the slightest proof of anything!,"Few films achieve such toothy tension, let alone sustain it throughout. Built on a fantastic cast, flawless direction, and sharp writing, Doubt casts nothing but on every character from the first scene to the last. Excellent philosophical questions are raised, particularly when a student's mother brings a very unorthodox view to the fore. Not a family film, but certainly a thought-provoking discussion piece on religious curiosities and good film making."
4,WHY doubt?,"The movie is entertaining and exciting to watch but there is a flaw in the story as well. For instance, instead of casting doubts and also to avoid false accusations, either one or both of those nuns could have asked these boys in private whether or not the priest had sexually touched them. Uncertainties are clarified. But then again, that would end the movie in half would it?"
4,Well done,"This is one of the most well-acted films I have seen in a long time. Streep and Hoffman are superb, and Amy Adams does a great job as well (although at times just slightly too much.) There were a couple of loose ends that never got tied up (why the light bulb keeps going out; why does the priest have long nails...) but that doesn't interfere with a good story. The negative about the film is that the message in the end is somewhat too heavy handed. It seems to be saying that if you try to be ""progressive"" within the church, you get run out and that the traditional elements within the church will go so far as to fabricate lies about those who buck the system. In fact one could even take away from the film that the ""good guy"" was the priest, even though he was an abuser. Nevertheless, as a film, the actors and writers did a great job."
4,Great Dialogue,"This film is so powerful because it is based on a very powerful dialogue. There isn't much going on in the movie. Just powerful dialogues between the major actors/actresses in the film.If you are looking for a movie that will keep you thinking about the words and ideas you are hearing, go for this film."
4,Doubt DVD,"Great cast, great movie. The previews grabbed my interest, so I'm glad I purchased this DVD. ""Doubt"" is definitely a good title for this film."
4,my thoughts,it was a veery good movie giving insight into the life of nuns and a ppriest. the acting was excellrnt
4,Philip Seymour Hoffman at his best,"As always, Hoffman and Streep, two of the most talented and versatile actors in filme, deliver great performances. A great story that leaves you with your own doubts."
1,I have no doubt...,"...what a boring disappointment this turned out to be. Im glad I didnt see it at the movies but got it out on DVD making it easy to do the dishes while the thin narrative plodded along.What was the point of this movie? To make the audience sympathise with the good intentions of the priest (PSH) who took a caring role of an underprivileged young black teenager and to turn against his accuser? And therefore the logical extension of this is that a lot of the allegations of sexual abuse within the Catholic church are factitious or exaggerated claims? That is, to instil doubt in US about institutional sexual abuse? If so then the movie is a disgrace.Even if this is not the message I doubt that there are any other redeeming features to it."
3,This movie is at its best when Meryl Streep is onscreen.,I wouldn't buy this movie but I probably will end up recording Meryl Streep's scenes because her portrayal of a Catholic School nun is PERFECT. There are just days when you miss the voice of justice and black and white sense of morality is the ultimate in shrewdness.
3,"BETTER THAN AVERAGE, BUT NEVER REACHES GREATNESS! 3 1/2 STARS!","I know many people really liked this film, but despite having some good performances, this film just didn't completely grab me. The story is interesting, but I found it to be predictable and slow. The cast is very good, but certainly not any of their best work, although I found Streep's character to be amusing at times. The story goes where I expected it to go and if not for the last few minutes the film wouldn't have gotten that extra half a star. I liked the ending and it helped me to appreciate the film for what it is."
3,Not the great movie I'd heard it was,"I really expected it to be better overall. I'm not Catholic, I was raised in a very religious home and went to a religious private school. I rejected Chrisitianity as a whole, and maybe that's why this movie failed to touch me. The acting was good, but it just seemed lacking. Not for me."
4,Challenging,"Film that's impossible to reveal spoilers because there aren't any. We cannot say the nun principal is in every way evil because she is privy to a long period of observation that we viewers are not. Likewise, the priest is at minimum guilty of burying the most serious offense an altar boy can commit. I'm going to take a very unusual stance and say that at no time was sexual contact implied. This was 1964, when merely allowing a student to go unpunished was a career destroying scandal."
3,And The Oscar Goes to.....,"Some reviewers referred to Doubt as a film for big-lobed geniuses. Others called it garbage.Doubt falls somewhere in the middle. This film is not garbage - its designed and was released to get Academy Awards; and like a machine well-designed for a purpose, it does its job. Doubt pushes all the right emotional buttons, has all the right actors and actresses and the story is heavy enough to get the Academy's attention. Plus it contrasts nicely with the Holocaust-related films that are usually a shoe-in at the Oscars.Even though this film is Oscar bait, Doubt is not bad. I liked the performances in the film and it is not boring. Sure, there are no car crashes nor explosions, but Doubt can still be considered a decent rental, if not a sale purchase.To the ""garbage"" reviewers: I recommend ""The Man From Earth"" - a ""thinking person's"" movie, but it is not Oscar-bait and it is very entertaining."
4,# good reasons to watch this.,Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman are 2 big reasons to watch this fascinating drama.The 3rd reason is the wonderful screenplay and smart direction by John Patrick Shanley.I enjoyed it!
2,"Acting adequate, but film is too stagey","This film is taken from a stage play by John Patrick Shandly, and unfortunately he also wrote the screenplay for Doubt. From the beginning we can see something is missing, the head nun's suspicions arise suddenly without time for exposition. For anyone who had the misfortune to go to a Catholic grade school during this era (me) this film will bring back memories, most of them not good. The ending purports to be dramatic, but it is ambiguous and will leave you confused. The problem here is we have a three hour play trimmed down for a two hour script. There is a glaring loss of continuity. I worked in insurance claims for 25 years and handled a great number of identical claims. This may be theatrical, but it gets nowhere near the actual way it was."
4,Powerful and moving,"I watched this movie expecting Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymore Hoffman to dominate as they always do. In both cases, these were amazing, layered performances, and maybe the best either of them have done (though, how one can choose...both are such brilliant actors!). Meryl and Phillip always astound me as they slip, chameleon-like into any role; body, voice, gesture, and movement all exactly in tune with the parts played.The showstopper, however, was the scene with Viola Davis, as Donald's terrified, trapped, broken mother. That scene was the entire movie. The twisted, heart-rending, gut-wrenching agony of a mother's love; having to make her own sort of Sophie's Choice, a deal with the devil, in accepting one unknown sort of fate for her son, while trying desperately to protect him from the terrible certainty of another. She deserved the Oscar nod, and should have won for this amazing, one scene performance."
3,"Didn't live up to expectations, but definitely worth viewing","Started out slowly for me, as I felt like I was watching Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep act, rather than feeling like they were the actual characters. But as the movie moved along, I did find myself slowly giving in to the story (and the performances). Amy Adams is adequate in the third lead role, but the movie is almost stolen away by Viola Davis (even though she's only on screen for about 8-10 minutes). The film certainly raises good points that we still grapple with today - personal certainty versus actual proof (ie. Bush administration and WMD's). The biggest misstep in the movie for me comes in the very last scene, which I won't give away, but to me seemed very out of character and weakened the whole movie."
2,Bad DVD Condition....,"I am so sorry, but this DVD just starts and then stops...it will not forward and it's been tried on several DVD players... I am disappointed. This is the first item I bought that didn't work or was unsatisfactory, Amazon's products and resources are usually first rate."
2,Dissapointing movie,"This is Meryl Streep at worst. Cold, scheming nun. Hard to believe her motives as wriiten in the script"
1,I doubt it deserves even a nomination,I don't like making negative comments but this time I feel obliged to warn people out there. This is just an over-over-rated movie. I insisted on watching it yesterday but although whatever I have tried I felt in to sleep.What a waste of time!
2,slowly paced and dull,"I know this movie is supposed to be about subtlety, and how paranoia can overtake someone's mind, and I appreciate those aspects of the film. My complaint is that it was slow, there wasn't much dialogue, and at times it was just dull."
3,"I ""Doubt"" if I will ever order an almost new DVD again.",The DVD sticks at different points during the movie. You get what you pay for.
4,VERY INTERESTING MOVIE,I ENJOYED THE MOVIE. IT TOOK TOO LONG TO GET GOOD. I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUSPENCEFUL.
3,Okay...,"DoubtIntriguing with many twists; however, you are left at the end to decide the fate (guilt or innocence) of Father Flynn and what role, if any, the Catholic Church played in consealing him or not. Depends upon your choice of outcome at the end of the movie. Realistic."
1,Shallow and a waste of time,"Count me among the minority of reviewers who doubt that this movie has any real merit. As they've noted, this movie only pretends to wrestle with uncertainty and doubt of a profound form. Anyone who entertains no doubts with regard to the big questions has fallen under the spell of an ideology; if you need this movie to be awakened to doubt, you've probably been in the grip of such a spell.The main doubt portrayed by the movie is actually a superficial one resulting from witholding information which would provide closure and meaning to the rather simple plot. The truncated ending (or rather lack of a real ending) is such a fatal flaw that any redeeming qualities this movie has (and there are many) are totally undermined, to the extent that my rating is pushed all the way down to the extreme of 1 star, which is a rarity for me (I tend to be generous with movie ratings).I have no doubt that the 100+ minutes I spent watching this movie were wasted."
3,Overrated but decent character piece,"The Bottom Line:Doubt works much better in its quiet moments (Viola Davis's scene springs to mind) when it eschews the thundering acting that works better on the boards than on the screen; the film is still worth seeing due to the convincing nature of the performances (exception: a weak Amy Adams) and several worthwhile scenes, but this trivial piece of Oscar-bait will not be remembered for very long.2.5/4"
3,"Not bad,but could had been better","I was expecting that the movie would have scenes turning into doonybrook style because of Meryl Streep's character exposing the sex scandal in the church.The acting was good.But the only one who did well in the movie was Meryl Streep's character.I did not like the dialogue of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character.To me the script was watered down.I was expecting the news media to get a hold of the story and things go wild.Why wasn't Hoffman's character arrested?Viola Davis was okay in the film.Amy Adams was fine but her character could have used a good script.In fact,Meryl Streep got a better script than anyone else.But on the other hand my review is mixed."
4,Bitchy Nun,While I thought the movie was very good with a good story line M. Streep really played a bitchy Nun. I felt like if I was in the movie I'd have to slap the ---- out of her.
4,Doubt is a very serious movie,Doubt is a well made movie. I caution viewers to hold on to their beliefs. This movie is for entertainment only and should not be viewed as judgement on the Church.
4,Superb acting,"The film poses dramatic questions of faith, abuse of authority, the fragility of children, hypocrisy and finally doubt. Iy is worth seeing it."
3,Weak tea,"Doubt is probably a good play rendered banal by the movie screen. There's just not enough of the play, which is a series of dialogues, to fit a feature film. Nonetheless, the substance of the work packs something of a wallop, emphasizing how moral certainty does very little to serve a relentlessly relativistic universe.You will probably not be bowled over by Doubt because of its vehicle, but the theme has resonance and the content will not leave you until you have sorted it out. I guess this could be seen as anti-religious in a way, but I think that the characters are just useful platforms for a truth that transcends faith and churchgoing and whatnot.Judge ye not. A hard lesson to learn, but hey, that's the stuff of theatre. See it, and be patient with the movie itself because it's not all that great."
3,Bumpy Transition From Stage to Screen,"Most playwrights should never direct their own work. John Patrick Shanley's 2008 adaptation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Doubt"" cries for the guiding hand of filmmaker Sidney Lumet, a master at stage-to-screen translation. Though Shanley has assembled a memorable cast, he knows little about cinematic technique. ""Doubt"" lacks the overall dramatic impact of its Broadway counterpart - even the denouement falls flat. Fortunately, the actors are excellent. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams make the film version worth watching, yet it is Viola Davis' heart-wrenching portrayal that stays in the memory. However, you must see ""Doubt"" on stage to fully appreciate its emotional power."
4,Great Vocals,"Paul Rodgers posesses one of the all-time greatest voices in rock music. He plays every instrument on his 1st solo effort since leaving Bad Company. Although he is not terrifc at any one, he certainly can hold is own on all of them. There are some great songs on this disc and you can go wrong with Paul Rodgers singing."
3,colorful but lame,"i bought this after buying HD moods Aqarium and Fire, which have stunning live images of fish and fire, making the TV look like a fireplace or aquarium.living landscapes take a different approach. it has constantly changing scenes, which is more like a live slideshow than being immersed in the scene. so, this particular blu-ray title is pretty boring.i got into these because the images look amazing, but, for me i wanted it to feel like you're really there, and this dvd moves around too much. HD moods is a better blu ray series in my opinion"
4,Easy Read,This text was assigned as required reading for a public administration course. I found the book to be easy to read and it gave a great deal of information on the NPR. I found it well worth the time.
3,Good summary of story,"The translated version of the classic ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"". Well translated, but Roberts cuts out some key interesting points that are integral in the story. For intstance he forgets to leave in Cao Cao's speech before his death, Zhuge Liang's seven battles with the barbarian leader as the Han Shu prime minister, etc.. It is akin to writing Moses' story, yet leaving out the fact that he parted the sea or that he spoke to Ramses."
2,Sing-Song-y Tape May Not Appeal to All,"I had never used a Berlitz tape to learn a language before, but the company has such a great reputation that I bought these audio cassettes on the strength of that. I was very disappointed; not in the content itself, but the presentation. This is more for kids than adults driving to work during rush hour. It's very sing-song-y and annoying and moves a bit too fast."
2,Mis-representation,"This is a complete mis-representation as to how it is advertised...it is NOT a full size helmet, and I got the run-a-round from the vendor as to the issue, he just did not get it."
3,Against All Odds Soundtrack Review,"The soundtrack is good, but I actually bought it for just one song,'My Male Curiosity,' by Kid Creole and the Coconuts. The song is really good, but I couldn't find it ANYWHERE else. Amazon had it, the price was great, and the delivery was fast, so it was worth it."
3,"GOOD MOVIE, HAUNTING TITLE SONG AND SCORE, SO-SO SDTK.","I've always believed that the movie ""Against all odds"" was an interesting attempt at making great film noir. That's why I've seen it several times. I bought the soundtrack because of the haunting title song by Phil Collins and the incredible score by Larry Carlton and Michel Colombier. The melodies ""For love alone"", ""The Search"", and ""El Solitario"" are top notch. The rest of the album, however, is extremely dissapointing. All the remaining songs unfortunately are second rate. Still, I recommend it. It is worth it to have the score of this film in your music collection."
4,Great Soundtrack!,"I truely enjoyed this CD. Especially track 1, ""Against All Odds (look at me now)"" by Phill Collins. That song is so amazing and touching, I would still buy the CD if that was the only song on it. All of the songs on the album are great though. I definitely reccomend it."
3,Good,"I don't use it every day, but when I do, I use it in my Nutribullet, so I don't really taste them, but they work out fine."
1,Dame this game was bad,dark angel plain and simple sucked the controls dont respond when you need them to bad fighting engine bad voice-overs jessica alba could have done better and the characters don't look like the actors avoid this game like the flesh eating virus when or if you come in contact with this game run like hell
2,Towards greater Bitachon or trust in God,"This work is commendable in its goal. Its aims to teach greater trust in God.No doubt that those who have greater trust in God, are more at peace with themselves and the world.I too would have greater trust in God.However there are real questions as to how far one should go in sacrificing one's intellect , one's questioning faculty, one's respect for truth in seeking out trust in God. After all the seal of God is Truth.There is also the question of whether one does not undermine faith by presenting a picture of Perfection which is not realistic and true.Wagschall does not really tackle the questions of the tremendous evils and injustices which are so great a part of Jewish and human history.I wonder if there is not a wiser way a more courageous way in Trust of God, perhaps more related to Job's ""Though he slay me yet I will trust in Him"""
2,Cute but is it really worth the price?,"This brooch is cute online but when you receive it, that's a different story.Since there are so many items hanging from the bottom, the whole pin goes down too. When you wear it, it seems droopy.The silver coloring on it, it not polished so it seems a bit dull to look at.I would not buy this product again or give it as a gift."
3,"ok, I guess...........","I've had this book for quite some time. I have mixed reviews about it. For the most part it is helpful, because other people have contributed this book. Some were people who have had good or bad hair experiences and are starting over. Barry Fletcher's book or input wasn't helpful and to make matters worse, he also tries to promote his own hair products. He tells you how to style hair, dispells the myths about hair coloring, etc., but doesn't tell you how to stop the hair loss. There are hair disorders but doesn't tell you what to do about it except Rogaine and to see a dermatologist. There is also a chapter where this minister writes that a woman should keep her hair long (doesn't like short hair), which makes her feminine but dying her hair blond makes her look cheap. Barry should've kept this chapter out and this minister should've kept that to himself because he sounded sexist.Altogether, I wish I found a better book than this one to promote hair growth"
1,Very Disappointed,I found this book to be a waste of my money. I was extremely disappointed and returned the book. The format of the book was unorganized and did not provide me any useful information. Save your money.
2,Don't waste your money,"For this book to cost so much, I would have thought it would be more useful. The book had alot of fluff and fillers, but not enough substantial information on how to inprove the condition of breaking hair. I read Shamboosie's beautiful black hair. I would recommend that instead, it costs way less, plus it offers great suggestions on what to do and what products to use to improve breaking hair."
3,Dissapointed,"I thought that the book was unorganized. The articles were written by various people, some with no actual hair care knowledge. It was not as practical as I thought it would be. It seemed to be filled with a lot of information but a great majority did not seem applicable to someone just trying to maintain healthy hair. Most of the articles seemed irrelevant."
3,Dissapointing,"If you are buying this book looking for information on how to take care of your hair you will be somewhat dissappointed. First, Mr. Fletcher didn't write the entire book. His comments are excellent and make up the heart of the book but there isn't enough of Fletcher In between his chapters are guest essays that range containing useful information like the nutritional needs of hair to useless personal memoirs such as one woman's disastous visit to a hole in the wall salon. The pictures are mostly black and whtite and are not as clear as they should be. Instructions are not always clear and too much is left unsaid. Frankly I'm sorry I spent the money on this."
2,Not helpful,I found that this book didn't get into too much details into the ways black women could prevent their hair falling out. The book focused more on case studies instead of answering the question of 'Why Black Women are Losing their Hair'. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who wanted to find out ways to stop their hair from falling out.

2,"So, So...","This book had some good information, but not enough on promoting hair growth. It was really a waste of money."
4,An Excellent tool for the Beauty Industry,"Barry, captured a void that was so needed for Black Woman. This book helps educate women and stylist to understand the importance of ""haircare"" covering all aspects of life. It deals with the foundation of life of hair; your health; life's stresses; consultation at the beauty salon; medications; manufacturer's creative marketing and much more......all factors that can help you avoid uneducated errors and make educated choices with your hair."
2,Sounds out of place,He started off a liitle to young and is no screwed for it.He is only like the age of 18 but this is not the best.He had a couple of good hits thought that is good enough now go home.
5,"calming uplifting ""traditional"" music","This is a great CD to listen to as background music or to veg out with headphones on. It is calming and soft and the arrangements of traditional music are very catchy and quite good. The contributing musicians are fantastic. I own other Celtic CDs and I must say this is one of my favorites. I never tire of the variety and engaging compositions. Highly recommend. If you are not a Celitic music fan, this could make you one."
3,not bad.,"Not expensive so you can take the chance. It is only a 3 minute song or so. It was fun, but would have like a few other songs maybe. But you get what you pay for."
5,Thurough and interesting,"This book has it all, chemistry, cultural context, use, abuse, past, present and future. Is geared toward someone who has at least taken some o-chem, although non-science types could still get something out of it. The synthesis explanations can be a bit in depth, I have a degree in chemistry and a bit of that was way over my head. Book is also well refrenced, so should you ever get the urge to make some of these drugs you know where to go."
2,Not for a 13 year old boy,"This is a required reading in our school for all children entering 8th grade. It would be a great book for the girls, but I am having a really hard time making my son read this. The school gave them 3 to pick from, which he got one that was interesting for him, and this one is required for all. Nice way to turn boys off of reading."
4,Sirena,Sirena has to be one of my favorite books. I love greek myths and this book has tons mixed with the actual story. I cryed though it tends to get kinda sad. but i encourage reading this book its the best.
4,Thoughtprovoking,"I can be leary of authors who give voices to characters who previously had no voice; however, Napoli does a brillant job of bringing Greek myth to life. Sirena has a depth of character rarely afforded the women of Greek myth. A bittersweet tale of an unlikely herione."
4,PrettY DarN GooD,"This is the story of a sea sirin named Sirena. She uses her voice to lour in men from the sea to try and make them fall in love with her so she will become immortal. She finds a young man on an island when she swims away from home but she doesn't immediately sing her love song for she wants to know what will happen when she doesn't. She then saves his life, and the young man falls in love with her. I wont tell you the ending but I will tell you it is sad. I gave this story four stars because it isn't as good as her other books such as Beast and Songs of the Magdalene."
5,GREAT BOOK! From 13-y.o. reader,"I recomend this book fully! I loved it! I have read it many, many times and it gets better every time! I've let alot of my friends borrow this book and they've all loved it, too. After I read this book, I thought about it for weeks afterward. A great book to go along w/ this 1 is ""Inside the Walls of Troy"" by Clemence McLaren. Both are great!!! READ THESE BOOKS!!!!"
4,sirena,I think this book was really great. The one thing I loved about this book was how she lowered the sailors into the water with her voice. I think this is one of my favorite book of all time.
3,"A Good Book, With an Even Better Ending!",The beginning starts out a little slow. I almost quit reading it after the first 3 chapters but I kept on going (mostly because i love mermaids!). Im really glad that i did. It turned out to be an excelent book once you got into it. I had studied Greek Gods and Greek Mythology the year before I read this so I recognized a lot of the same sort of stuff. It was a good book with an even better ending.
3,This will sound stupid...,"To me, this book wasn't depressing enough. After reading other Napoli books like Zel and Song of Magdalene, I curled up with this book expecting a good cry, but the ending was just too... satisfactory."
3,read me!,"Sirena is for you if you're into love stories and Greek mythology.She was cursed to become immortal, but only if she's loved by a human man. This she wants,the true love of a man, but it takes them to their daeth. find out if she stays with her true love Philoctetes,a man, after all."
4,Seriena,"Donna Jo Napoli's book Seriena is wonderfull and fancifull book! This book is about a young mermaid and the adventures she takes with all her sisters and Seriena trying to suduce a young mortal to find true love. Donna Jo's writing paints a perfect picture in your imagination. If you like great books and fantasy this is one of the best books you can find out there. so try this book out, it's worth it!"
3,"critical, but good","I thought that Sirena was a well writen book. The beginning was a little slow but once you got into it, it was hard to put down. I really thought the book would have been better suited for someone younger that I(13/8grade). Overall it was a good book with a lot of captivating parts."
3,Sirena,"I realize that I bought it used, however, there was no mention of the HUGE crease on the back cover and how fragile it is. It feels like it's going to fall apart."
2,Sirena,"Sirena Scholastic Signature, 1998,210 pages,, ISBN 0-590-38389-2Donna Jo NapoliImmortality, the chance to have no pain, no death and no physical pains what so ever. To live happily with you sisters, and swim in the sea forever. This is all Sirena has ever dreamed of. But this privilege has to be earned, as all good things in life. A mortal man must love her, even though she's a mermaid. When the day comes, will she sing that song that makes men go weak in the knees, or will she risk dieing, to have a relationship with the man who could be, the man of her dreams.The authors craft was happening minute by minute, and was always in Serena's perspective. When you combine these two techniques of writing, not much excitement can happen. But the original plot makes mythology lovers wishing there was more."
2,Strange story&#65533;,"Napoli has written numerous enjoyable retellings of folk and fairy tales for the young adult audience. In this book, I felt she faltered. She tells the story of the Greek Sirens (which are pictured to be mermaids).Sirena, the main character, knows that she is cursed, being half-human. The only way to lift the curse is to convince a man to mate with them. Then, she will become immortal. Sirena decides to separate from the other Sirens and finds a castaway alone on an island. They are initially afraid of each other, but begin to fall in love. Will Sirena want to be immortal after falling in love with a human man? I found the story dragging a lot, and perhaps because the story of the Sirens isn't as well known as some of Napoli's other retellings, it seemed a bit boring to me as well. I think she has written better."
2,"Tedious, Melodramatic Romance","Although ""Sirena"" by Donna Jo Napoli is classified as a fantasy, I feel it is much better suited to the romantic genre. There are quite a few problems in this book. For one, Sirena isn't very likeable as a heroine. She spends most of the book dwelling on the fact that her true love is going to die and she's not. Considering how romantic the book is, Sirena doesn't really seem to be trusting or tolerant with Philoctetes. She often complains how he lives on land, wants to return to his home, and collects things.Another major issue is that, considering Napoli's other works, one would expect this to be a retelling of a fairy tale. Not so. ""Sirena"" is no fairy tale; it is a romance that happens to involve mythology. Overall, I would reccomend ""Sirena"" to fans of Lurlene McDaniel, and for fans of retold fairy tales, the works of Robin McKinley, Cameron Dokey and Tracy Lynn."
2,I was expecting something better...,"Well, I love stories about mermaids and I really wanted this book. But I was in for a big disappointment.Sirena is a mermaid longing for immortality. She can only gain this if a mortal man loves her. After a misfortune on the rocks of Anthomesa, she swims to the island of Lemnos. She then meets a man who has a snake bite. (The snakes were sent by Hera, lady of olumpus.) She cleans the wound, and the two devolpe a love.I know it sounds interisting, but really, this is not a captivating story. The ending is too ambigous, and she could have extended the story to make it something better, (and tragic.)I could'nt get past chapter two of the story. It was that boring. I only know what happened because I read the ending and other select bits and piecies."
3,Sirena,"The book Sirena is a very great book for someone who likes mushy/sad/lovey dovey stories.If you like books with a mystery in it you will not enjoy this book as much as someone who likes love stories.Sirena the protagonist in the book is very shy and not involved.When she notices the sailors beating her sister it changes her whole perspective of everything.in this book the antagonist is a sailor,the head sailor infact that made the decision to beat Sirena's sister. You don't read too much about the antagonist.I believe that when the antagonist decides to kill someone,that Sirena loves,is the most evil thing a antagonist can do to the antagonist.My thoughts about the book are that it is definately not my favorite book because I don't really like love stories.This book gets interesting when Sirena falls in love with a man.Its as if you don't know if they are getting married."
3,A fishy tale of romance,"I am almost done with this book and I agree with the above reviewer: too few characters. I think it is interesting how Napoli personified the Greek characters, and I liked Sirena's independent streak,that is,refusing to lure men to their doom through her singing. I'm not a fantasy reader, so I found it a little unbelievable. The use of present tense throughout the story was a little irritating. The subject matter of passionate love seems better geared for the older young adult reader while the simple vocabulary made it more suitable for the 4th-6th grade reading level--found this irritating as well. I am reviewing as a librarian. Overall, imaginative story, but some reservations."
2,Please Don't Sing Any More Sirena,Very disappointing. It is very sexual even though it is touted as a YA book. I remember reading this at 13 and my friends and I were quite shocked.It has a decent grasp of history + culture but the execution is off. It had such promise!
4,A unique story of a mermaid...,"""Sirena"" was a wonderful book, which I enjoyed completely. However...its not your traditional mermaid story of a lovesick mermaid who eventually got turned into a human and lived happily ever after! Actually, ""Sirena"" incorporates mythological gods and creatures and portrays the mermaids as half-fish, half-god. The mermaids are given the gift of song, to seduce men and so gain immortality. But Sirena is different. Although she too possesses the gift of song, she chooses not to send the men to their death. Instead she saves a young man who was bitten by a serpent from death and falls in love with him...This was a wonderful fantasy, and definitely worth the reading."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is the best book I've ever read! I love the way this auther writes about the story and about life.
5,Great! Just great!,"John Blacksad is back! On the search for a kidnapped girl, Blacksad finds himself in a small town torn apart by poverty, corruption, and organized racism. The concept of White versus Black is dealt with the color of one's fur. The White supremacist group, Arctic Nation, is comprised of white-pelted creatues, while a Black militant group has distictly black pelts. Blacksad, a black cat with a white snout, is literally in the middle.The story is well-written, but not as gripping as the first Blacksad book ""Somewhere Within the Shadows"". The artwork is, like the first book, excellent. The attention to detail is staggering.This isn't just for anthropomorphics fans, but everyone who loves a great graphic novel, or entertainment in the style of clasic Film Noir.Strongly recommended!(Is it just me, or does the white mink in this story look a bit like White supremacist Matthew Hale?)"
5,When Walt Disney meets Raymond Chandler,Have you ever tried to imagine a Raymond Chandler novel where all the characters are animals? Canales and Guarnido did it. Blacksad lets you enter a world with a gloomy atmosphere dating back from the 50s detective novels.
3,A disappointing follow up to Dope Box.,"Well...I went in to edit this review, because the album has grown on me since I first bought it...though I'm still a bit disappointed with it. Overall, it's mellower and more experimental than Dope Box -- less straightforward pop. I just don't get a sense of completeness with it.I'd say Unisex Headwave is their best after Dope Box, then Soft Songs.Anyway...I know, not much of a review here. If you know and are familiar with Jack Drag, I say definitely buy Soft Songs...but if you have nothing of theirs yet, go for Dope Box first."
1,Good to see that fans are keeping the place clean,"It's sad, but it happens - bootleg CDs get put up for sale on Amazon and they can't remove them fast enough. I commented on two other bootleg sales and can't find them any longer, obviously Amazon took them down and new identical ones came and took their place. Some people just don't have any shame at all.If you're going to call on Amazon to remove these CDs, you should rather suggest that they blacklist the seller, remove any means to buy it and mark the item as fake. That way, no customer would ever have to be fooled again."
1,Trash CD...,"Why is Amazon selling this??? This CD is NOT an ""Official"" t.A.T.u. [aka Taty] CD. This is a bootleg CD from Russia. Don't buy it, its not official, t.A.T.u. wont recive a dime from the sales of this CD."
2,Rehash of good material,"IF MEN COULD TALK was wonderful, and I've eagerly awaited publication of this, his next book. It contains some good new material--most notably the ""what to look out for"" lists--but a good third to half of the book is a rehash of his last volume. Whole paragraphs are transplanted directly from IF MEN COULD TALK into IF LOVE COULD THINK.No author should publish a new book until and unless he has a book's worth of new things to say. Come on, Dr. Gratch. You can do better."
4,This collection makes a big splash.,"Originally, I'm not really sure why I purchased this book... I didn't exactly have my heart set on reading this book, but it was cheap and didn't look bad. When the book arrived, it turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise.Unlike other mermaid collections I've read, this one is actually addressed to the little girls who are interested in mermaids, but not so simple as to turn off collecters and scholars. Before each tale is a small summary of information about merfolk in various cultures to set the background for the tale. Nothing extraordinary, but it's kind of nice to get some mermaid trivia. Best of all, the author makes an attempt to get stories from a wide variety of places; there is a story from Switzerland as well as Japan!I strongly recommend this collection, for it can be enjoyed by anyone."
2,Ick.,"This book is poorly constructed (physical binding) and is made of cheap paper. The illustrations are not very good, and often do not even depict the story accurately. Two examples are when 1) the story says a mermaid has legs, yet the illustration is of a mermaid with the usual fin and 2) the story says a character has tattoos on his face, yet the illustration does not depict them. The characters in the illustrations also look like stock white faces, regardless of the origin of the story.For a much better book, both in binding and illustration, I would recommend Mermaid Tales from Around the World by Mary Pope Osborne. The pictures are large and colorful in that book, emulating the style of the area of the world from which the story comes.Don't waste your money on Serenade of Mermaids."
4,Good product to have,I had it for about two days before I noticed the window mount is broken and had to return it but within that two days I must say it was a very good purchase and very handy.I was not able to see a very clear movie on it but I didn't have it for long to play with it.The GPS part itself worth the total price of the device. I recommend this product.
3,last bridge is a pleasent interlude,"Beth is comfortable with what life has delt her. There has been the pain of loss, but the joy of love. Suddenly her life is forever changed by the arrival of Jon. A mysterious stranger who seems to know more about who she is, than she does. A very sweet love story evolves. While not deep reading, and not completely believable ""Last Bridge Home"" is very enjoyable. Like a well worn sweatshirt on a cold day, ""Last Bridge Home"" will be re-read often, especially on days I need a light pick-me-up."
2,Very light reading but the storyline was far fetched.,This is my first Iris Johansen book and she came highly recommended. The book was light reading and would be something to read on vacation but though provoking it wasn't. I found the premise of the story not very believable.
4,Amazing book,I really liked this book for it's depiction of characters who aren't afraid to feel. A man who was in the Vietnam War meets a woman whose family was affected by the war. How they connect is thought-provoking and moved me.
3,"An extremely brave recital, but the interpretations are tepid","One has to admire the courageous integrity of a soprano who could fill a ecital hall with Schubert chooisng instead to program six songs by Sibelius followed by Berg's Seven Early songs. Soile Isokoski has a lovely lyric soprano that has darkened and grown fuller with maturity. She is Finnish and therefore attuned to Sibelius's rather moody vocal style (his musical inspirations are essentially German, not Scandinavian, however). At the end of the recital we do get to hear some familiar lieder by Strauss, several of them masterpieces. but by then it has become clear that Isokoski is too placid to hold on'es attention, and her accompanist is equally bland, of not more so. That's too bad, given the adventurous and welcome repertoire."
1,Powerpoint in Disguise,"Rubbish, pure rubbish. This is a cartoon-like collection of powerpoint slides masquerading as a book. If anyone actually pays money for this (like my company did), they deserve to lose the money. Congratulations Dr. Harry (a doctor of what, exactly?) you made some more money on this collection of slides."
1,A huge waste of money,"I was issued a set of Mikel Harry's, ""The Vision of Six Sigma"" when going through an implementation of Six Sigma at Seagate Technology. The books were absolutely useless. Consisting mostly of pictures originated 10 years ago at Motorola, they provided little insight and in most cases were of no value at all because without sufficient text, the intent of the pictures is unclear. I'm sure Mr. Harry can use the pictures for his own presentations, but I've never known anyone else to be able to use them. They do make a good bookend--they way a ton."
2,Pretty but flimsy!,"When I got this, I loved it. The orange bead really grabbed my eye and I wore it with everything. But it so flimsy. It broke after wearing it twice. I was really disappointed. Normally I dont have a problem with NVIE but this time it was a bummer."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An interesting look at society and how gender influences it. Theprotagonist, Charlie Johns, in this story winds up in the society ofLedom. In Ledom shumans only have one gender, and manage tofunction quite happily in that fashion.While there, Charlie is given a decent background briefing on their culture and technology.Charlie is confused, and begins to suspect something might be rotten in the state of Denmark."
4,Count 'em,"Engaging documentary about a group of card-counting Christian blackjack players who, financed by some backers, aspire to go to casinos and using the skill of card-counting pull $ from casinos.In the early scenes we see them celebrate as they reach certain levels. They eventually have a non-Chrisitan join who they eventually think is stealinging.As it goes along it is sad as we see some of the players lie to get into casinos to play as they have been banned, some wear costumes. Some players appear to lose their talent and are dismissed. Engaging and interesting, a character study. They admit exposure breaks a person down."
1,Good WHEN IT IS NOT BROKEN,"I was so excited to get this steamer and it did everything as advertised - magically cleaned so much so well and without any chemicals. BUT, the machine is absolutely the MOST UNRELIABLE, expensive appliance I have ever owned. Within the first few months, the entire boiler went bad and had to be replaced. Then the connection hose was leaking, and had to be replaced. Then the entire body of the device developed a crack and had to be replaced, and low and behold, a year later, the boiler went bad again. And all this after using this maybe twice a week here and there. They have good customer service in terms of fixing things, but really, should anything break this many times??? And then there is the hassle of shipping the thing to be fixed again and again and again.. I love what this machine can do, but for the price, it is truly a complete piece of garbage in terms of reliability. I would never recommend this machine to anyone."
4,loved the book,"I loved this book and I thought that the jewellery was lovely.However, I would'nt recommend this book to a beginer, or even anyone who hasn't done japanese style beading before. As with most japanese beading books, there is very little written directions. There are diagrams showing the beads and thread paths instead. The thread paths are easy to follow, but I dont think that they are sutable for a beginer because you have to follow them yourself and there are no step by step diagrams"
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"I checked this book out from the library because I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy it or not. Thank goodness I didn't buy it. The photos were gorgeous, but when I turned to the back of the book, the instructions were terrible. They're all diagrams with little or no worded instructions. I found it very difficult to figure out where to begin half of the time. Some of the easier projects like the wavy choker looked pretty simple to follow, but other than that, you need to be very good at reading diagrams. Not only are they hard to read, but the illustration are very tiny.I'll probably just copy a few of the diagrams and pictures that I like and return it to the library. I would not reccomend this book to those who are beginning beaders. Even if you are an advanced beader, you still may have trouble with the tiny diagrams. I would most definately reccomend checking this book out from the library to see if you like it."
3,let's hope a picture speaks a 1000 words...,"because the diagrams are IMPOSSIBLE to follow - and entirely too much was lost in the translation... if i wanted to use the exact same beads i'm lucky at least in the fact that i've got a Toho supplier here in NYC - but...wish i was as brave as beadq (see first review) - i'm not afraid to jump in, but i can't even figure out where to start, which is too bad. even my boyfriend, notoriously good at reading diagrams, is clueless...pretty photos tho, i guess."
3,Somewhat controversial,"Although graphic, tells of teenagers today (or hopefully not). Geez, learn it from the master"
5,memories,what can I say about Laura B ? it just reminds me my teenswhen I was a young guy listening to the radio the whole timethe first time I heard Lucky one I was speechless about suchwonderful voice as soon as I could I got the CASSETTEand used to play it time after time ( used to say CYNDI )It's a shame she never relese another album in spite of thisshe will be one of the best voices in the music bussinessnow Im 37 and and Im trying to change all of my old recordsand cassettes of Laura for cds there's no doubt time pass byand Laura will be always Laura at least in cds....
3,Upbeat collection but a bit dated.,"I have several of Laura's greatest hits CDs (not that this is a greatest hits collection) and bought this for the remixes on it. My only complaint is that the songs on this album (including the remixes) sound dated. I realize that it's not a 'new' release. So, I should not fault it for that reason but it's not something that I will listen to often. More of a collector's disc for the remixes alone, I suppose.We miss you Laura. God Bless!"
3,Hate the cover...and some of the songs are lousy,"Laura displayed a nice range on this album, but this album is a combination of good material and duds. On the good side - Self Control, Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow, With Every Beat of My Heart..on the bad side, the annoying cheapness of the repetitive hollow ""Ti Amo"", the boring, mechanical sounding ""Satisfaction"" (used in the flop sci-fi show Automan, in which Laura played a stalked pop star),and the dreaful ""Breaking Out"" in which Laura basically screams her way through the song. The Lucky One has a few good moments, but her finest performance is ""Will You Still Love me Tomorrow"" with only Laura and piano. It shows that Laura was indeed a great talent. Too bad the higher ups didn't showcase her vocal ability to this effect more frequently."
4,LAURA'S LEGACY,"Laura Branigan possessed a voice that could be gutsy or vulnerable; seductive or innocent; powerful or gentle. During her success in the 80s, Laura scored with her techno-pop hits like ""Gloria"" and ""Self Control"" and power ballads like ""How Am I Supposed to Live Without You."" Sadly, Ms. Branigan's career was cut short when she died at the age of 47 in 2004.SELF CONTROL was her third album and exemplifies her vocal strengths admirably. Relying on strong lyricists and composers like Diane Warren, her songs were evocative and potent feminine viewpoints. Songs such as the provocative title track and TAKE ME reinforce that sexual tension. She also gives a sensitive rendering of the classic WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME TOMORROW, her passionate vibrato perfect for the song's desperate pleading.Laura Branigan earned a place as a significant presence in the eclectic 80s music scene and I wonder how she might have fared if she had a longer life."
1,DO NOT BUY: DO NOT RENT,"Wow, what can I say. I CAN'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT THIS GAME! IT has mediocre graphics (it could've been better on an n64 for crying out loud, bad sound, a HORRIBLE camera angles (half the time your looking at a wall while some alien is beating your brain's out) and the worst thing about this game is... IS THAT IT TAKES LESS THAN 2 HOURS TO BEAT! NO KIDDING! WOW, Don'T BUY! Don'T BUY! Don'T BUY! please don't buy"
1,UGLY AND DUMB DOLL!!!!!,"People, do NOT get this doll, she is ugly and dumb! Like as if any girl would ever become a famous rock star! Becoming an extra in a movie (my scene) with Lindsay Lohan (who by the way is a REAL person!) is WAYYYY more true to life! This doll is so not pretty and her feet come off! How stupid is that?!?! Don't get this doll, get a pretty, NOT AT ALL trashy doll like My Scene!!!Buh-BYE."
1,What a joke,ABOUT THE DOLL:1.GORGEOUS???NO!!!2.BEAUTIFUL???NO!!!3.PRETTY???NO!!!4.SWEET???NO!!!5.COOL???NO!!!!6.UGLY???YES!!!7.SLUTTY???YES!!!8.SCARY???YES!!!9.IN THE TRASH???YES!!!10.SLUTTY CLOTHES???YES!!!(...)ABOUT THE ACCISORIES:1.COOL BELLY RING???NO!!!2.COOL TATTO???NO!!!3.GREAT SONGS???NO!!!4.CUTE THINGS???NO!!!5.AWSOME IDEA???NO!!!6.STINKY BELLY RING???YES!!!7.STINKY TATTO???YES!!!8.STUPID SONGS???YES!!!9.JUNK THINGS???YES!!!10.UNCOOL IDEA???YES!!!BRATZ DOLLS ARE VERY UGLY AND OH YAH!!!!!I DONT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING.YOU WILL ANWSER ME......STOP ME......I DONT CARE.
1,Unhealthy/poor choice toy for a child,"This happens to be a poor choice toy for a child.Reasons: stomach is showing, inapropriate dress/clothing, makes women look awful, poor poor role model, tatoos/peircings.This is an awful choice for a child.Sighned,Cherry Trip."
4,Sick of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am so tired of all you My Scene bitches mouthing off about Bratz being sluts! In fact,the whole world does! So what if they did dress a little sexy in the Treasures? Theywere dressing like girl pirates. It was inspired by the Gwen Stafani video ''Rich Girl,''and Gwen is a cool person! I'm not going to say My Scenes bad. But it's uncreative. They just use the same ideas and girls. There is thirty 1 bratz girls existing. (...)"
1,come on people - bratz are sluts,"the only reason why little girls like them is becuase they think they are cool owning little sluts. they think its cool how these girls' dress, so they beg their parents to buy them. and the people who say they are cool are probably the little girls who think like this. And barbie is so much better, she actually has clothes, not little strips of fabrics. She is original and is pretty and has feet, not little balls on the end of her legs to put her feet on. She is also porportional, which means she has a normal size body. She doesn't have a big head, eyes, and feet. Bratz should change their name to either Slutz or Hookerz- an honest 13yr old"
1,"Bratz, Ewwww!","I used to be a HUGE fan of bratz. But not anymore because, for one thing, I'm thirteen, and secondly, I've noticed that they are getting so obsessed with becoming better than Barbie. Yah right, like that's ever going to happen! Barbie is such a cutie! I also think the My Scene are extremely AWESOME too!"
5,Cloe is aswome,I boughet cloe at my Toys R us a month ago she has lovely streaked thick hair i always comb and hair style it she also has beauitful blue eyes love the eye shadow gillter i cant wait for there dvd it look's so aswome loved the frist one going to love the new movie.
4,Spell Check,guess what linny i am actually 14 and it is so annoying because maybe some of these people truly are 14 and you know and y do you think 14 year olds must be more mature. we are just people who luv our bratz so yer. and the reason most of us hate my scenes is coz of there fans becuase they say stuff boutus then we get offended say sommin bout then and it goes on and anyway its lyk bratz fans trademark to say:BRATZ RULE AND MY SCENE DRULEaha ha ha------------------This is not English.-Linny
1,A VERY BAD DOLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS DOLL IS BAD.SHE HAS A TATOO AND A PEARCING IN HER STOMACH.THIS THING IS A BIIIIIIIIIIIIG PROBLEM IF SOMEONE WILL HAVE PEARCING IN HIS BODY,AND BY THE WAY,IT`S TOO BAD THAT MGA MAKES BAD DOLLS FOR LITTLE GIRLS.THIS DOLL MAY TEATCH SMALL CHILDREN TO MAKE BAD THINGS ON THIER BODY WHEN THEY GROW UP.IF SOMEONE THINKS IT`S SO COOL TO HAVE PEARCING OR TATOO ON HIS OR HER BODY,IT`S HIS OR HER PROBLEM.THE MY SCENE GOES HOLLYWOOD DOLLS AND BARBIE AND THE MAGIC OF PEGASUS IS VERY GREAT FOR LITTLE GIRLS.MATTEL MAKES 10000000000000000000000%TIMES BETTER DOLLS FOR LITTLE GIRLS.GET MY SCENE DOLLS OR BARBIE DOLLS ARE WAY BETTER.THEY ARE PERFECT TO COLLECT.MY SCENE AND BARBIE RULES,BUT BRATZ DOLLS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,BLueBLackcAT,"I like Bratz but I prefer My Scene.Last week I went to Kuala Lumpur (capital city of Malaysia)to find this cute adorable Cloe.But still I couldn't found her.I looked every shopping mall in K.L (including TOYS'R'US) and only found My Scene.So, I spend all my 250 ringgits to buy My Scene and some books.I really wanted this Cloe badly.I didn't celebrate Chirstmas cause I'm not Chirstian.For all those are Chirstian,Merry Christmas and have a wonderful Cloe!!!!!!!!"
3,give me a break,"After reading all of these reviews I must say that we all need to put an end to the bickering nonscense. Seriously, Bratz are the copied product of Barbie. She has been around for years upon years. Bratz only came out a few years ago, so how can Barbie be the copycat? Why can't you children get along? Fighting over Bratz and Barbie are like fighting over the colors pink and purple. Everyone is entitled to his and her own opinion. We are not on line to have a war, we are simply giving a opinion to help other consumers out there to make a buying decision. Thank you."
2,What happened to these?,"These bratz dolls aren't the best. Trust me. They have tattoos on their stomaches, and now my little sister wants tattoos because of that. If I were you, I would never let a little kid see these bratz, because kids might just end up wanting a tattoo just like my sister does now!"
1,Carrie's War,I didn't like this book because I found it very hard to understand.I also didn't think it was very interesting. Carrie was always in her own mind thinking back to the past where herself and her brother Nick were wartime evacuees. Personally I think it could have improved upon the opening few paragraphs and stated it more clearly because Carrie was continuously drifting in and out of worlds and I found this very annoying.
3,"It was a very good book, if you are infatuated with a good b","This book is about carrie, a girl that was moved, along with her brother Nick, to London to get away from WWII. They are separated from both of there parents and miss them dearly. Mr. Evans, which they are staying with, is an unpleasent man that is strict about going on the carpet. Riiiight Suuuuure"
4,Finally read it after all these years,"This book was given to me (in 1973) when I was 11 by my favorite aunt. I kept meaning to read it, but never did. Thank goodness I found it in the attic. I enjoyed it very much. It may appeal to an adult more than a child, which is probably why I didn't read it when it was given to me."
4,"Sounded boring, was actually great",With the boring front cover and a bland excerpt on the back I thought I would just stop reading the book and throw it away after the first twenty pages. But it really surprised me and was one of my favourite books when I was a couple of years younger.
3,Carries War,"My name is Matthew Coates and I have just finished reading Carries War .I thought the book was okay but I did not really find it very interesting . I found that the book was not really that easy to understand and a bit confusing at first . The story was set in Wales during the Second World War .It was about two children ,Nick and Carrie ,who were evacuated from London to Wales to be looked after by Auntie Lou who tried to make them happy and Mr Evans who was not a very nice man. The children had to get used to a different way of life when they lived in Wales."
5,"Reflections of the Stylemakers(DVD Version,2004 60mins,same car on Cover/black Cover)Great!","I have the dvd Version of Reflections of the Stylemakers,and it is a refreshingly different approach to the many Corvette Videos out there some sadly repeated and using the same Announcer in them,this one has some photos and footage seen before and a similar sounding or maybe same announcer,however the similarities end there,as you have Great Interviews throughout With Jim Palmer,Dan Gale(From The Museum,Rest in Peace,),Larry Shinoda among others.It is great Mr.Lawrence ""Larry"" Shinoda is on here,as he is famously known for His Stingray Contributions which he discusses.It doesn't leave out Ed Cole,Harley Earl and Mr.Bill Mitchell(which they keep calling Billy Mitchell?)Contribution,so it's not all about Zora.To me Engineering is great and there is no denying his contribution but He's not the father of The Vette' and Design always played a Bigger Role(thank Goodness).It includes up to the C6 Coupe of 2004."
2,not what they used to be,"I have had these shakers for years....have had to order replacements twice because I dropped one (always salt for some reason). This order is inferior. As the previous reviewer said, lighter in color, weight and embossing. Not as nice."
2,Poor Design,"I just received these in the mail today and am so disappointed. I am returning them. They are very pretty. They are large like I wanted and will hold a lot of salt. And the salt will stay there a long time as there is just one little circle of small holes for the salt to get out. No way would salt come out without shaking and shaking and shaking. Too bad. I wanted to not only enjoy the way they look but I wanted to use them also. So, one star for the pretty part and one star for the nice large size."
5,Salt and pepper shakers,Love them. They are big so I don't have to constantly refill them. The glass is heavy so they aren't easily broken.
3,Too big,"These shakers are very nice and the color is good. However, they are much larger than I like. As a single person, it would take me years to have to refill the pepper!"
4,Too quick ending,"This book, and its prequel, This Scepter'd Isle, are both books that are well worth the time to read.Only 4 stars because the ending left me wanting to know more, and feeling that there were other threads of the story that hadn't been woven back into the ""Deus ex Oberon""."
3,"Eat Up, but not sure about slim down.","Nice photos. Not low carb, but generally have a lot of veggies. A lot of fat free and white refined flour, including pastas and tortillas which could easily have been whole wheat. This was published 2001, so maybe whole wheat wasn't as popular than. I liked the stories of people who had lost weight and kept it off and how they did it. I made quite a few meals from this book, but not convinced it would slim me down. :)"
2,Was it even edited?,"This was a huge disappointment and a waste of my money.... Highly disappointed. Had to re-read MANY sentences to understand what was originally intended, as this book was never edited professionally... I found that very frustrating... You will be able to guess the killer in the early chapters.... Don't waste your money, seriously."
1,A hoot,"Hard to review this, really, but since it packages itself as ""history"" then I'm forced to give it one star.Churchward was a classic crackpot of the late Victorian age. He often signed himself ""Colonel"" Churchward even though he never saw military service. His books on the ""lost continent"" of Mu are reportedly based on the ""Naacal tablets"" which nobody other than himself ever saw, and after he died no trace of them was found. It's generally accepted that the Naacal tablets existed only in his imagination and that all his information on Mu was made up.The big question is whether this was a deliberate hoax or the ramblings and fantasizings of a mentally unstable man. It's hard to tell.Churchward's books are NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, yet some people do seem to take them at face value. Please, folks, don't do that. They do have some entertainment value as classic examples of kook lit, though, and for that I might give them three stars.PLEASE, DO NOT TAKE CHURCHWARD'S BOOKS SERIOUSLY!"
1,Good for a laugh,"Churchward is the kind of ""scholar"" who gives citations like ""Ancient Egyptian record"". This is Edgar Rice Burroughs fantasy presented as serious history and archeology. Enjoyable as fiction, but that's as far as it goes"
1,A Joke,"This thing is a joke. I used it about two weeks. And after getting tired of scrolling through screen after screen for anything I wanted to do in the same amount of time it would have taken me to pick up seperate remotes and use them I realized the foolhardiness of such early technology. Later models may be more responsive and better laid out, but this one isn't and never will be. Save your money."
2,Battery Sucks..Manufacturing defects,"The remote is awesome only if it works..The battery supplied does not work and the reote has defects as dead on arrival or problem with battery discharge due to""Glow""button.My frinds were lucky as theirs work perfectly..Awesome product though.."
3,Harmony 676 remote,"The 676 didn't meet up to all my expectations, programing could be easier, isn't able to work my Bose surround sound system, Once the time is spent to completely program the device it might be more useful."
2,Great until it stops working,"I was pretty pleased with this remote initially. It was easy to load up my various components using the included cable. Press the TV button and the cable box and tv come on. Press the music button and the receiver and cd player turn on and the tv and cable box turn off. Great, right?Well after a year or two, the buttons that are commonly used don't work properly. The One and Three keys either don't respond or give me several repeats. The Exit key doesn't even work anymore. No response at all. Up and Down channel are also problematic. I've discarded the changeable face plate to make it easier to press the buttons.You'll have to decide if the cost benefit is right for you, but I have much older remotes that still work, so I was pretty disappointed with this product."
3,Good capabilities but button worn out after 9 months!,"Well, for eight months I really loved this remote but after nine months, one of the directions (up) is already worn out. Hopefully, I can find another empty key and program it for ""up"" but the thing shouldn't be worn out after nine months (not for the money these things cost!)."
4,Good Universal Remote.,"I've had this for a couple of years now, and I'd say it was a good purchase. The Harmony 676 has all of the features you can expect in a semi-expensive universal remote. It's computer programmable, lights up a nice blue color, works with every device you can throw at it, and fits nicely in your hand. What's nice about this one versus previous remotes I've owned is it's really good on batteries, I've only had to change them twice in two years!The only gripe I have is the software that comes with it is a bit buggy on a Mac, and doesn't seem to be updated that often. Aside from that, it's a good buy."
4,Help that was needed,"New HDTV in combination with DVR box, A/V receiver and DVD player was going to be a problem with the existing cable company remote. The Harmony 676 does it all. Setup was easy with just a little computer knowledge. Occasionally it doesn't perform the functions as requested but usually because of operator error and it takes very little to correct the problem. Battery life isn't great but you can bypass that issue with rechargeables."
5,Best thing since sliced bread,"This is one of those products that make you say, ""How did I live without this?"" after the first use.The step-by-step set up directions were easy to understand and the device works great.We went from three separate remotes, and the hassle of having to adjust video and sound feeds, to a simple push of one button to switch from TV to a DVD.My dad is in his 70's . . . guess what he's getting for his birthday."
2,overall functionality is a winner but the 4-way switch is a loser,"We found the central 4-way direction switch difficult to press accurately. This button surface is a thin circular ring around the ""OK"" button. You tilt this ring in the direction you want to switch; up, down, left and right. Members of my household were frustrated that the button movement is so sensitive one would often accidently end up pressing a direction you did not want. If you have any trouble with fine hand movement as one relative of ours does, do not get this remote.I returned this to Amazon within the return period but have yet to receive a refund.I have since learned that the equivalent button on the Harmony 550 is shaped more like a disc than a ring which enables successful button presses. If the directional button on the 676 is a problem for you, get a 550.I highly recommend that you try out these remotes in person before ordering since a return of this item to Amazon has been problematic for me."
1,Only works for a few months,"I had been a fan of these Logitech Harmony Universal remotes for the past couple years now, but I hate to say that I'm finished with them. I've been through three in that time, for a total of $370, this model 676 being the last.When they work, they are wonderful. But each of mine only worked for a few months, then, I guess the buttons wear out. I am the only one who uses it so it's not as if it's gotten extraordinary use. Logitech's tech support is very poor, even though I made it to ""Level 2"", they still put me through the same troubleshooting paces I had done myself, over and over again without success, and even though it's still under warranty, they refuse to replace it! So I'm sitting here with 3 very expensive paperweights. I'm surely not going to try for the more expensive ones! If the $150 ones can't cut it, I'm done.As a result of my experience, I can't recommend them. So I'm back to juggling 5 remotes. :("
5,Sliced bread? HA!,"This is a terrific little toy. Does everything you could want it to, and the setup is a cakewalk. Very pleased. I'd like to say I miss having to use 4 remotes to set up to watch a movie, but I'd be lying..."
3,Hard to use buttons,"There is certainly a lot to like about this remote. Several things hold me back from giving it five stars.1. The programming options for the macros force me to make selections I don't want to make for my TV. Therefore, everytime I run a macro it changes my input. I have an external switch box and my TV input sequences up each time a macro is run (even though I want it to stay on input 1 at all times). I then have to use the help to straighten it out.2. The buttons are very hard to push. Thank God I don't have arthritis.3. The screen text is small and hard to read. Also, the backlighting shuts off too quickly. Unfortunately my eyes aren't what they used to be.There are a lot of programming options and flexibility. Therefore, I will keep this remote and hope the buttons loosen up over time."
2,it would not cotrol my dish network DVR,"I was very excited to get rid of all the remotes I have. I spent an 1.5 hours to download sw and set the harmony 676. It would not control my DVR although the sw had recognized the DVR (dish network 522). I called customer support and got some to talk to in 15 minutes, they failed to get it to work with out ""Learning it"" which is a process where one can teach the remote a specific function to a specific device. I did the process for the power on and it worked but the remote failed to include this step in the power on Macro, customer support was still on the line. Even if power on worked the way it should, I had to teach the remote all the DVR functions that I use which is a very lengthy process. I returned the remote and lost the shipping fees back and forth since Amazon said it is not their fault the remote does not work the way it should."
5,The only remote you'll need!,"This is a great remote; it's the best I've ever owned. I shopped many different remotes, multiple price ranges. I found this one to be the most user friendly. I have only one tip for those wanting to purchase a ""Harmony"" remote - get to know your components before you program the remote! I found myself ""teaching"" the Harmony new commands which were not on the pre-programmed (web site) list. All in all, it took me several hours and a few trips to the computer before I got it set up the way I wanted. However, once I ""learned"" it, the remote worked perfectly. It seems infinitely expandable, and it will do whatever you want (or need) for it to do without a lot of hassle. Highly recommended! (...)"
4,Better than original remotes,"This remote works better than the company supplied remotes. Set up is a snap with Logitech web site. As far as battery usage, too early to tell, but have feeling that this wont be major problem."
3,"Good, but questionable quality","I bought this because I needed an inexpensive remote when building my home entertainment system. Unfortunately, the remote came with defective skins, so I was only able to use the silver skin; the other two were too badly formed to be used. Also, the ""ring"" selector is very imprecise, which renders it useless. However, a friend who bought the same unit experiences neither of these issues, having three very usable skins, and a crisp ""ring"" selector switch. So if you buy this and get a bad unit, consider sending it back for a replacement. You will probably get a better one."
3,"Not thrilled, but not bad.","I had another Harmony remote that was a lower model. The other had the controls for play, rewind, etc on the very bottom of the remote which was a little awkward since we use them all the time with our DVR. This one has the buttons placed much better, but there are enough downsides that I actually like our other, cheaper model better. The buttons are harder to find on this one and the material they are made out of is different and the buttons are much harder to push and get a response from. The multi-directional circular button is particularly hard to press and deal with. The glow button doesn't stand out very easily and is hard to find in the dark and that makes finding all the buttons difficult in the dark. The different color covers is cool if you have a room like we do that's in black and red, but for most people it's no big deal because the standard silver looks the best."
2,Good but turned out bad,"I was looking for a universal remote and found the Harmony 676. At first I liked it a lot but the buttons were too similar in size and shape to work in the dark, and I kept pressing the wrong buttons. That wasn't the worst. After awhile the fast forward button quick working for the DVR. I ended up having to go back and use the original remote with my cable box. While I think Logitech is a good brand, I think this particular model does not hold up well even in light to moderate use. I would not recommend it."
1,Buttons don't work after a year or so,"I loved this remote until the most used buttons stopped working after about a year and a half. Since it is out of warranty is basically now a paper weight. At first I would have given this unit 5 stars, now I will only give it one star."
4,Perfect remote...til the buttons stop working.,"4.0 out of 5 stars Perfect remote...til the buttons stop working., December 2, 2009This remote has a perfect layout for cable TV DVR use, and the only remote with switchable color plates. It feels perfect in your hand, every button is within reach and easy to find in the dark. I loved this remote!So what's the down-side? After a couple of years of use the buttons all stop working! You have to press them VERY hard to make them work, if at all. You can try to stick aluminum foil/tape inside, but it's a temp solution at best.So now I am off to buy the Harmony One instead, which is lacking the A and B buttons. That's right, I loved my Harmony remote so much that, even though my other one crapped out on me, I am buying another one. I looked at all the other models, but none have the perfect layout like my old one...it will be missed.Comment Comment | Permalink"
2,5 stars while it lasts...,"Initially I would easily have given this remote 5 stars. I told everyone how fun it was to program and how great it worked as a universal remote. Imagine how nice it is to hit an activity button like TV or DVD, and then all of your components turn on and automatically turn to the correct setting.That 5 star rating has degraded to about 2 maybe 1 star about a year and a half later when the most commonly used buttons wore out and either never work or you have to use your finger nail and push really hard on the buttons. I don't believe this remote was over-worked or abused in that time. I actually kind of babied it because of it's price and how much I liked it.I guess when I purchased a $150 remote I expected it to last at least 3 years."
4,"great support, complicated product","The remote works well, but it was tough to program. Fortunately, the support is great and the person walked me through the process."
2,Very poor customer service.,This remote did not control my dvd recorder/vhs properly (it was not listed in the harmony database) and harmony did not return my email for 6 days. They were supposed to respond in 24 hours. I sent the product back because it did not work.
3,Those with new Macs will be annoyed,"A word of warning to those with Intel-powered Macs (Core Duo or Core Solo). The Logitech software does not work on them, so you'll have to find a Windows PC or older PowerPC processor Mac to do the programming on."
2,Difficult to use,"Set up was a pain because the software didn't like that i had a router/firewall; I had to install the software on a different computer. Next the TV (Westinghouse) wasn't a good match for the remote. I have to press a couple buttons and scroll thru menu picks just to turn it on. Maybe there is a way to reprogram it, but it doesn't come with instructions. I'll play with it some more, but I think this ""program via the internet"" remote is a waste of money."
5,Violin by Ponty,Recalled this album from my college days and glad I was able to find it on Amazon. I am not a music expert but enjoy this album for the violin playing with a twist.
3,An average Ponty album saved by Holdsworth's soloing,"The composition and playing on this album are typical Ponty, nothing exceptional. Some catchy hooks and a very eightes sound. I guess if you're a Ponty fan you will dig this, but to me the best stuff was on seventies albums like Aurora and Enigmatic Ocean. In fact, the best thing about this CD is what made 'Enigmatic' the best Ponty album of the seventies, the beautiful, floating and cliche-free soloing of british jazz guitar virtuoso Allan Holdsworth in contrast to the predictable, lick-basedPonty."
5,One of the Best Books I have ever read,I always recommend this book to anyone I know who likes a good story. I have not had one person yet who started this book that did not finish it. Its one of the best books I have ever read. It has to be the truth because you can not make this up. The author should have been given the pulitizer prize.
5,"Fascinating, Riveting but depressing-----","true life story of a black man unjustly accused and sentenced to die for the murder of a young white woman in a small town in Alabama. I have been through Bay Minette several times and could relate to the environment where the trial occurred. If I didn't know better I would think this case occurred 100 years ago; alas, it did not; I found myself struggling to continue reading the book because of the fact it was so very sad and horrifying. The incompetence, the lies, the coverup, so they could get this poor innocent black man convicted of murder. thank God for men like Mr. Stevenson- I guess my only surprise was that they never found the true killer- one is left to guess who did it, I guess. Does anyone have any update as to if they ever found the killer of these women?"
5,Still captivating,"Many years ago, a friend who is a lawyer, gave me this book to read, and I thought it was one of the best non-fiction or fiction books I had ever read. I am rereading it today and I find I still feel that way.It is captivating, engrossing and so well written you feel as though you are looking over the shoulder of every character. It puts you right into the heart of the murder investigation and you ache to solve it."
3,Time saver,Would be great if weld didn't break.On the other hand did get the job done.One of the welds held long enough to finish
3,push rod remover,"I gave this tool a three star. It would have been a five star but, I had to weld it back together after the first use. I would recommend this tool but, I would throw some welds on before you use it. It's a time saver."
2,Some good ideas but repetitive,uses the same structure for each week's practices and repeats the same steps. I found this way to repetitive. It is a good idea to break down financial exercises into a year long practice.
3,THe Haunted Northwoods,"Interesting read, but not great. As a lifelong resident of the ""Northwoods"", I have heard some tales of unexplained happening and they are always interesting.This book relays some of those unexplainable happenings. Although an interesting read, I wouldn't call it great."
4,The Haunted NorthWoods,"Like the book learned a lot about the area I live in,y of my area I like anything that has to do with Haunting and History in my area."
3,Outdated but okay.,"Same format, native speakers, and instruction methodology as in Level I. The going will be a bit easier in this second part because by now you should have already mastered some of the pronunciation hurdles that trouble English speakers. Purchasing both Level I and II gives you 24 ninety-minute cassettes of audio which is quite a value if you like old-school ""overlearning"" type of instruction (i.e. rote memorization, repetition practice, lexical drills). It's a dated approach but still works well."
3,A book made of teacher's notes,"This material will be of great help to you if you are a serious French learner.Material covers a great deal of subjectsThe book is absolutely necessary to follow-up the ""tapes"" and material in the course are from what I call ""teacher's notes"".Book is a serial of photocopies made of original type-writered paper sheets. Underlines are made by hand and in a very poor manner.Very old fashioned and outdated.Again, this material will help you a lot as a second resource If you are a visual person, this book contains no photos, drawings or anything in the like.Regards,Moises Gallardo"
5,Inspirational,"Great Book !! This is a great book for those young and old to teach us how our simple little daily gestures can make a difference in the lives of others surrounding us. Take the time to read this book ,and you will definately walk away with a different outlook on life !!!"
3,"Well played, but boring","All three of the musicians who make up this trio are very skilled musicians and each has at least a relatively successful career, but this album is rather boring in the end. Certainly, individualy each song is interesting. I like Frisell's wry style, I like Carter's usually relaxed, swung grooves, but every track sounds like the one right before and after it. Listening to the album, I really dug the opening track (the standard, Miles and Carter's 81) and looked forward to what would come next. Truth is, after that first track,the album doesnt really go anywhere, it stays in its rut. I, personally, did not have the patience to listen to what is in effect, really just an hour and four minute long single song. Im really surprised that such excellent musicians couldnt make more of this album."
1,Grandmatical Erras,"I purchased this book for my boyfriend who is a cruise director. I flipped through it after he received it and I came down with a headache from the illiterate prose that soaks each page. Punctuation, spelling... it belongs on Deck Zero."
2,Standard material if you're familiar with cruise ship life,"This book is entertaining if you have never been exposed to the folklore and mores of cruise ships. Odds are, that if you have ever been on a cruise, you have heard these anecdotes and jokes, most likely from your Cruise Director. It's full of old standard tales (the woman who got stuck on the vacuum toilet; the passenger who asks if the crew sleep on board the ship; etc.) but unfortunately didn't supply a single anecdote that I was not familiar with. If you ever worked on a ship (I haven't), forget it. You have heard the tiny cabin/ shower jokes ad nauseum I'm sure. Fun material overall, but nothing new, and I found the author's tendency to present the information as if it were totally novel most annoying."
3,Inspiring,its hard to say that there are only a few songs on this cd that I enjoy but it's true. I am so thankful for those--Helen is a phenominal singer. I look forward to her future releases.
3,This Was A Letdown!,"After reading several David Hagberg books High Flight was a big letdown. Rrossfire,Countdown,White House and Joshua's Hammer were excellent thrillers that I enjoyed reading. This book took up too much space trying to be a techno thriller in the mode of Tom Clancy. This detracted from the heroics of the good guy Kirk McGarvey. The villains in the story were also shifted to the sideline by the techno gimmickery. This book was also way too long. Because of the subject matter it wore on your patience to finish the book. This was definitely not on of David Hagberg's better efforts. I am glad he got back on track with his later efforts. This was nearly bad."
3,ZZZZZ,A great book if you are flying to New Zealand from Seattle and your flight is delayed in Guam. This book is well written but way too long. I am halfway through and am tired of the dialogue of endless meetings and incremental plot development. This is not a book aimed a final climax but rather the resolution of too-may subplots.
4,Excellent club set....,"I really did not know what to think when I got the dvd. I am pleasantly surprised by this concert. The sound and video quality are excellent and Union rocks. If you are not familiar w/ Union, then check them out. Straight ahead rock n roll w/ no bs. Corabi is a f'n rock star."
4,great set of tools,"I bought this set of tools for my husband. (He's using them as I type this.) The quality is what I had hoped, i.e., the wood is better than previous sets we had had, and the stainless is heavier weight. The only drawback so far is that the tongs are more difficult to use with small pieces of meat. Overall, though, well worth the price."
3,Interesting Short About Reproductive Freedom,"I just caught this short on a double bill with The Education of Shelby Knox and was impressed. Using simple images and language Tiffany Shlain nails the problem of the erosion of reproductive freedoms in a country built on the tripartite ideas of Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.Starting with very basic statements about planet earth, population and what it means to be male and female, Shalain morphs into a very serious discussion of reproductive freedom without ever beating her viewers over the head with her political views.This is one that should be seen by both camps pro-life and pro-choice. Seek it out."
3,Love it BUT...,"I love it and it's a nice saddle, BUT!1) the string holding the seat to the saddle on one side is not attached... after a trial ride too!!! WHAT IS THAT? IT needs to be repaired!2) It scratches very easily3 ) it gives my high withered TB(built like a WB) a sore back... so I have to use thick pad + an additional thick half pad under the saddle.4) The saddle's ""BROWN"" color is more like a red-ish color than anything.5) The seat is also VERY flat! and pushes you foward and out of the seat...good for jumping, but not nec. if your riding a hot horse who doens't liek you to be foward on his back and while jumping.It's pretty though! = ]]] It's what you get for a $300 saddle."
2,Noisy.,"I thought that the new fluid bearing drives had solved the problem of hard disk noise. I already own an Iomega 120GB HDD 7200 rpm external Firewire drive, and it barely makes a breath of a noise. But this 160 GB LaCie external Firewire drive makes an annoying high frequency whine---you know, the kind that changes volume and phase as you move your head around, that burns into your ears after a while.Other than the noise, the unit appears to be solidly constructed. An advantage over the Iomega drives is that the LaCie has two FireWire ports so that you can daisy chain more than one drive or FireWire appliance; the Iomega has only one port, and it is not a standard FireWire port, and requires their special cable."
5,Meets or exceeds my expectations in every respect,"This is a great drive. The main concerns I saw in the other reviews were that itwas loud, and that the drive gets hot inside the case. Either the person whocomplained about the noise has the most sensitive ears in the world orelse they had a very different drive from the one I got, because this one isvery quiet. Of course it isn't totally silent, but the spinning noise is justabout inaudible from two feet away, and even when it is accessing datayou only hear a very faint ""chucking"" noise.As far as the drive being too hot becasue this enclosure does not havea fan, the metal case does get warm to the touch but not hot. I can'tcomment on longevity as I have only had the drive for a few days.Also the metal surface is not quite as smooth as it looks on the picture,but that just makes it harder to damage and easier to hold on to. OverallI am very satisified with this drive and recommend it to others."
3,Loud!,"Works perfectly in every respect, but it's very loud. It emits a constant high-pitched whiring noise which becomes quite intolerable after a while."
4,Detailed and specific about some but not all... overall good.,"This book is full of great tips, tricks, and techniques. It gives some instruction in basics but not all and does not specify for certain issues you may have with actors/actresses of odd size or shape. For example I wish there was a more detailed section addressing pants patterning rather than just alterations. But really it is meant to be an overview and other books on pants patterning are just fine. It is overall a good book with lots for beginners to learn and for oldtimers to remind themselves of."
5,"Light rock? Yeah sure, but...","Light rock, perhaps, but nothing to sneeze at. There are some very romantic balads from an era we should have never left."
4,A story worth readying,"This is a good read. The story line is great and keeps your interest right until the final paragraph. I did find a couple of typos, but I blame the publisher for a poor job there. Some of the dialogue could have been condensed."
2,Yamaha RH2C Headphones,"'BAD' in just three letters.This is the lowest quality YAMAHA product I have ever used. I own a lot of YAMAHA musical instruments/PA equipment including Speakers, but this is the worst I ever came across.Horrible in every aspect, from the production quality to sound.YAMAHA should discontinue this product and prevent further brand erosion."
1,disapointed,"I was expecting more from this product. I received it in a timely manner, actually it came exactly when the seller said it would. But, the sound quality is very poor. I expected to hear the bass stronger and hear the music louder compared to walmarts ear buds that only cost $6.00 but its not true. It is hard to return this item because of the packaging you have to break the plastic to get to it. Lesson learned for me."
3,The fox needs a new one of these,"When I ordered this film, I expected a much more detailed, better documentary than the final project, going into each Zorro production in detail....This one is much shorter, and many things are just skimmed over, as if they were unimportant. Most of the footage here in the introduction, cut-in scenes, and ending comes from the Alain Delon French film. ... Only three actors from the new Mask of Zorro film wre shown, and the actual movie plot was skimmed over in a breath. But still, this is an impressive look at the evolution of the fox, ....Zorro began as a pulp fiction-story by Johnston McCulley. He would become famous through the Douglas Fairbanks films. Zorro-imitators began to appear, such as Batman. The Republic serials, Tyrone Power, and Disney all contributed to Zorro's fame. Later, forigen films would come in, as would the new television series and The Mask of Zorro. THis is a good documentary, but needs some work."
2,"Well-written, but exclusively focused on graphic arts work","This book deals exclusively with the flow of work through a graphic arts/printing job shop. It is well written, but not a ""how-to"" book for general business process analysis. If you can get past the graphic arts technical jargon, it does provide a good metaphor for analysis and improvement of other kinds of work flow."
5,The best band ever,Here is a group that merged together to produce the most original sounds and compositions in our time.They are unique in every way and every album is superb WOW. My one regret is I have never seen them liveThank you
2,+1/2 Lightweight pre-war military comedy,"Eddie Bracken and Dorothy Lamour star, respectively, as Bob Hope's comedic and romantic foils in this lightweight military comedy. Bob plays Don Bolton, a pampered, smartaleck-y movie star who latches onto marrying Lamour as a way to to avoid the draft (""I'm not a coward,"" he says, ""I'm just allergic to bullets."") The trouble is his would-be wife is also the daughter of a bristly old-school Army Colonel, and she shares daddy's distaste for shirkers. Their love-hate relationship slowly tilts towards love, and eventually he proves himself worthy of her hand. The sketch-oriented script has episodic laughs, but is pretty predictable and sluggish: it might have been funnier at a time when universal conscription was becoming a reality, and civilian America was ramping up to meet a total war economy. In that regard, it's an interesting cultural relic."
4,Ahora que podemos hablar...,"El amor en tiempos oscuros es un texto que permite conocer al estudioso, al interesado y, hasta al curioso, acerca de algunos de los mitos gays de la literatura y el cine,si tomamos en cuenta a Pedro Almodóvar.Colm Tóbin, parte de su propia experiencia iniciada en las sacristías, las conversaciones entre su madre y sus amigas, hasta llevanos a develar los misterios de escritores como Oscar Wilde, Thomas Mann, Francis Bacon, Elizabeth Bishop, Mark Doty, entre otros.El léxico es sencillo y la redacción es amena, lo que hace que el lector disfrute de una comoda lectura, medinate la cual, el lector puede aproximarse con suma facilidad al conocimiento de los que amaron en tiempos en donde la homosexualidad no solo era censurada o prohibida, sino hasta perseguida tanto por la Iglesia como por las leyes imperantes."
4,The Consciousness of the Atom,"A WOW subject, you say? Definitely! In approximately 150 pages, Alice Bailey succeeds in explaining evolution like Darwin never could! She goes from the evolution of substance, to that of form, which leads to the Thinker, MAN. He, too, evolves as consciousness does. The goal of evolution is sought and found in the ultimate evolution of the cosmos. Few pages but hefty reading."
5,An excellent introduction to the work of Alice Bailey.,"In this book the scientific relation of matter and consciousness is discussed as evolution progressively affects the atomic substance of all forms. The ""atom"" emerges as a miniature but complete replica of the energy structure common to all forms of life--cosmic, planetary, human and subhuman.This book provides an intelligible basis to the occultist for a study of consciousness in depth and in right relation to the life pattern of the universe."
2,Caveat Emptor,"I should have read the original publication date of the book before purchasing it. This may have been a very good book in the early 20th century, but not so much for the early 21st century."
4,Deadly Terror,"The book was pretty good. It was interesting. Anyway, Liz fell in luv with Will and I like the twist how the phyciatist was dead"
3,It Could Have Been Better,I really thought the first one was better than the second part. The Return Of William White Part 2 is interesting I thought it was really slow but when I read the ending I actually like it. Anyway if you need a book to read this is one.
1,Talk about a piece of me arse...,"I'm sorry, but no. No, no, no, no, no. I read the first of the books when I was in America with friends. I happened to love it. The insight into Elizabeth was truly inspired. Yet now that William and Elizabeth are 'together' as it were, the story slips into something rather predictable. Not that the tension doesn't build up towards the end and all, but that can't salvage the rest of the book. I hope for better things..."
3,Could have Been Better,"I read Cyberstalker and I didn't like it all that much and I have to say that Deadly Terror was much better, because it had more excitment. Although I couldn't believe that Elizabeth trusted William White and went on a date with him. What was she thinking? If this guy came after me twice to harm me, and no matter how much he seemed to have changed, there would have been no way that I would go out on a date with him."
3,Be aware!,I read this book with great interest since I was going to Hawaii to snorkel. All main geographical areas where shark attacks occur are covered from South Africa to Hawaii. A description of all the species of shark which are involved in attacks are covered as well at the statistics of their frequency. The history of human attitudes toward sharks is discussed. In the early nineteen hundreds people eradicated sharks with dynamite. Now we study them. The evolving theories about how dangerous sharks are is very interesting reading. It was thought that sharks were not interested in people. Now we know they are and fighting back when attacked is recommended. There are other books which give better illustrations of the various species. It was interesting to read that the bull shark cruises many rivers throughout the world where it attacks people. Ultimately this book reads at the level of a newspaper.
1,Could have been educational. Sensationalist slander,"This back, like many others of its kind, does very little to examine the animals themselves. Peter Benchley himself said he could never write Jaws today, and yet people still right books like these that revel in the ferocity of a shark attack rather than look at the bigger story.Folks, the oceans we swim, play and fish in largely belong to the sharks. It has been that way for millions of years. They are graceful hunters that deserve every amount of honor and respect the terrestrial predators(bears, tigers, wolves) receive. Yes, they can be deadly. But rather than treat them like serial killers we can work to better educate people of their behavior."
3,Only a newspapers info summary,"I expected a more comments-supported summary of shark attacks all over the world. It is not included the famous attack on Albert Kogler, San Francisco, 1959. Only a collection of newspaper notes."
2,Cut to the Chase,"This book reads quickly. It's a collection of newspaper articles. Although I was hoping the book would talk more about the size and behavior of the attacking sharks, the wording is quick, much like the attacks."
3,"omiited shark attack May, 1956 S.F. USA - Beverly Jo - ?","I was disappointed, because the shark attack on a girl named Beverly Jo was omitted. The attack occured in the latter part of May, 1956 off of the coast of San Fransciso. The girl was bitten in one of her legs. I was hopeing to find the detail story."
2,"Good book, but...","I've been a Christian home school father for a number of years. R.C. Sproul Jr's book is one of a number that I've read. It's more of a primer, but still a good introductory work to help introduce friends to the biblical reasons to home school. I used to recommend this book but can no longer do so. Call me old fashioned but it's because I've got this thing about the character of authors, the same reason I can no longer recommend William J. Bennett's Book Of Virtues. Good book but the author's character casts in doubt the sincerity of what he espouses.I've got the same problem with recommending the book of an unrepentant defrocked minister."
1,I was shocked!,"While reading this book, I was reminded of some of the reasons that we homeschool, even though they to be picked out from amongst all the rambling. I was absolutely shocked, however, at the out of place remarks that cast judgment on others."
2,"good, but not the best","This book does a pretty good job of discussing a parent's responsibility for raising our children in Christ and His Word, and shows that homeschool is the best atmosphere for that kind education. That said, I also found his writing style difficult to follow- too much rambling- and the logic did not seem tight to me. I highly recommend two excellent alternatives: So- Why Do You Homeschool? by Mimi Davis, and Upgrade by Kevin Swanson. I found the arguments and logic in favor of homeschooling much more persuasive in both of these well-written books. Both of these authors are Christians, and their writing style is more gracious to those still considering the option of homeschooling, than what I found in Sproul's approach."
2,Easy read type but no substance.,"I found very few circumstances were this reference book came even close to to the comprehensiveness of the ""Random House Crossword Puzzle Dictionary"". The only thing that recommends it is the easy to read type face."
4,crossword dictionary,i use a combination of three different dictionaries. This one has an excellent reference section and is good for one word clues with longer answers.
3,Meja- it gets annoying,"When I went to scandanavia, this song got stuck in my head every time i saw it on MTV europe. It's a catchy song, but it does get somewhat annoying. And it has that unmistakeable beat. Just remember when purchasing, it'll be a coaster for cocktails in a month."
5,Perfect!,"These were perfect for us. I love the nice crisp white color. The seams are sturdy, and we will be orderding more!"
3,The Safe-Keeper's Secret (Firebird),"This was a lovely book. I ordered it simply because Sharon Shinn wrote it and I love her writing.It is more of a young adult book and that is fine, but it wasn't what I was hoping for (ok to be honest I really want more Angel series of 12 house series LOL) but it was very nice non the less.Good for early teens. Well written and interesting."
4,well...mmmhhh....its not that bad...,"but not that good either.I like these kind of stories, qualm and equipped with self-assurnessbuuuut, I found it a little boring too.Also they way some characters were described, the setting in this world..made me kind of uneasy. The persons and the places seemed a little bit out of time and space. And in this case I don't mean this to be positive.Just felt not real enough, and yes I know, this book is supposed to be fantasy ...Also I did not like the writing style (by the way, sorry for mine ;-) so much. I read other books of her, and they seemed to be mor e mature...or more definedResumee:I liked the book, I liked the idea, but some plots were to constructed and some not defined enough,some of the caracters were not deep enough, andthe end of the book came to soon, like Sharon Shinn ran out of ideas at the end, and just wanted to FINISH the book..Decide for yourself"
3,Complete?,"This CD collection is wonderful; it has much of the material from the movie that was only included in the extended edition DVD, but it is far from complete. While it does have the complete version of ""The Passing of the Elves"" and two versions of ""The Road Goes Ever On"", many of the songs are highly incomplete and inferior to the originals. ""Aniron,"" the theme for Aragorn and Arwen performed by Enya, is incomplete and the lyrics are hard to match to what is being sung. The sound quality for this song is even worse on the accompanying DVD, which is supposed to have all of the music in ""superior sound"". The song ""Prophecy"" is reduced to two barely-audible lines and ""May It Be"" is shortened and different than the original. $60 for this when there are more complete songs on the original soundtrack is ridiculous."
4,Lovely themes,"I listened to the recordings straight through. I enjoyed the music, and found the many returns to the primary musical themes very emotional. But I have to admit that I could only listen to the recordings as background music. These are not pieces that sustain my interest. Now, granted, my attention span is not long these days, but I guess I'd hoped to be so moved by the music that I could allow my whole self to simply listen. That didn't happen."
5,Something is missing,"I'm surprised that no one has mentioned this. The last bit of music you hear at the end of the fan club credits on the FOTR extended dvd is NOT on this CD box set. It's an alternate version of ""The Breaking of the Fellowship"" track that is more emotional and more joyous. Don't get me wrong, this box set is worth every penny. I just wish that this one track would be part of the set."
5,GREAT!,"This purchase completes my set of all three Complete Recordings from the LOTR trilogy. Each is great although somewhat hard to find now. If you love these soundtracks, I would definitely recommend obtaining a copy. It's worth the search."
5,Comparable to Wagner's Ring Cycle and Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker,"This is some of the most complex symphanicly orchastrated music you will ever hear; truly pleasure for the ears. Great accompaniment to the films, as well as the books. I hope that Shore will be releasing all three film scores uncut like this one."
3,"rating the item ""The Lord Of The Rings : Fellowship Of The Ring (The Complete Recordings)",The three CDs are in perfect quality but the DVD is scratched and the box is torn at some places
5,LOTR Fellowship Complete Recordings,"Everything is here, from Gandalf's and Aragorn's little singings to Enya's ""May it Be"". How can you go wrong? I have the single disk versions for in the vehicle, but THIS set is what I listen to at home. Excellent!"
3,"Great Collection, Poor Packaging","I realy can't add to what others have said about this set, the music is simply the best LOTR soundtrack collection out there! It is all here, and the contents of this set will make any LOTR fan happy and the music DVD is a great one disc addition if you want to hear the entire score in one sitting (to which I have done a number of times already).My only complaint is the somewhat flimsy cardboard box that houses the contents of this musical treasure. Mine came damaged, and considering the price, I expected better packaging. This is a minor quabble on my part and NO, I havent returned it due to the fact that the music itself Is what I truly treasure, It just would have been nicer to have recieved it undamaged.Music-5Packaging-3*for the record I had rated this Item 5 stars not the 3 stars that is showing at the top of my review*"
3,Same song - different composition,"If you are expecting the soundtrack versions of LOR music - this is NOT it. It does have all of the music in one place but it is noticeably different from the soundtrack version. Vocals (Into the West, etc.) are poor compared to the soundtrack."
4,"Stunning music, but DVD fails to deliver","Wow! What a great box set! I immediately popped the DVD into the player. You can imagine my disappointment when, no matter what audio selection I make, all I get is regular 2 channel Stereo. Very upset."
2,Lord of the Rings,"I heard an excerpt of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship... on the radio & rushed home to order. The set is much darker than the excerpt I heard, so a little disappointed there. While listening in the car, there are some areas that are very soft and hard to hear, while others just blast out the windows. I enjoy the complexity of the music overall, but probably wouldn't buy another set like this."
5,The Ultimate FOTR Music Collection,"If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings, you're going to want to pick this up, and go to the product's website (just search yahoo for ""Lord of the Rings complete recordings"") and download the free liner notes, which are like a 50 page pdf document that has a track by track analysis, photos, a listing of the instruments, lyrics, and a ton of other information. Best yet, the liner notes are free! (In fact, if you're an LOTR fan you're going to want to download this whether you buy this or not.) Also, be sure to pick upThe Lord of the Filmsto complete your collection.As for the Complete Recordings collection, it includes more than just highlights, more than just the music from the theatrical cut, and more than just the music from the extended editions: it includes all that plus unused concepts that were edited out of the picture. It's the ultimate collection!"
5,Fantastic!,Anyone worried about the price of this set? I was. Until I started listening to the CD's that was. This set (as well as The Two Towers) is well worth the money. Shore's score is beautiful. Anyone who is a fan of the movies or the original scores should pick this up. You won't be disappointed.
5,A Wonderful Journey back to Middle Earth,"This recording is a ""must have"" for fans of the music from the Lord Of the Rings films..I own the soundtracks from all 3 films and they are enjoyable, but they seem only a sampling after hearing this set. You can close your eyes and imagine each scene in the movie. The quality of the sound is beyond excellent. I love the added bonus of having an additional recording on a DVD that lets you listen to the whole soundtrack without interruption. I am eagerly awaiting the complete recordings from ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King""."
2,Outdated and Lame,"It was OK.Mostly.However, my mom laughed at the pictures... its copyright 1999, but the pics look like they're from the 50s. (or earlier)The 100+ are really just variations on a theme. the book is much smaller than I anticipated. I would say, there's closer to 25-30 projects, with 3 or more variations on each, and minimal instructions."
1,A disappointing purchase,"Inspite of the book's relatively good reviews, I found that it covered my expectations not at all well. Everything was too much. The stationery examples were too elaborate, the accessories were too old-fashioned and of a poor taste, the colors were mismatched, the bouquets were too fancy and poor at the same time for a wedding in style, the memorabilia section was nothing nice and special as well. Fortunately, I have purchased two more books. I will keep this book for a very few reasons, that I feel I have to state them: the stationery gave me ideas for other invitations, the twig ball on page 91 gave me an idea of how to use pot pourrie, the twig arbor on page 123 is fantastic for Christmas and the directions of how to make a wreath at the ""Staging a reception"" section. I really don't want to be bad, but I was really, really disappointed."
4,Handcrafted Weddings,"I was looking for new wedding decoration ideas so I checked out this book and several others from the library. Out of all the books, I found this one to be the most helpful with very good ideas, easy to follow instructions and picures. I was able to put some of the ideas to use at the last wedding I did and the decorations went over very well. This book is worth buying."
5,great book with beautiful projects,"This is a wonderful book, with beautiful pictures throughout the book. I saw it the first time at Michaels. From the moment I looked through it, I knew it was a valuable source in planning a do-it-yourself wedding, or even just adding a few homemade touches to a wedding that is professionally planned. This book has a few basic ideas for each of many aspects of a wedding. There are a few ideas I'm not too thrilled about and that's why I bought an additional wedding decoration book to supplement this one. I also bought a budget book as well, to help to keep the cost low and i bought an wedding organizer, which makes it easier to keep an overview over the whole wedding planning. There are a lot of wedding planners out there, so you are well advised to study them carefully, to find out which suits best for your purposes."
4,I'm very surprised by the negative reviews...,"My seven-year old son picked this book up to read tonight and was completely immersed. It is an approachable, light version of a classic that he found captivating. What could be bad about that? I thought it was well written for the purpose... to introduce classic stories in a manner that teaches and excites the child to read more. He couldn't put it down. We will definitely purchase more from this series of books. Well done."
1,There are many better renditions than this!,"This is an overly simplistic and poorly written introduction to the Arthur legend. If there weren't many better presentations of these tales for young readers, there might be an excuse for such a substandard rendering. Unless you want your kids to think that writing sentence fragments is preferable to constructing clear complex sentences, you might want to stay away from the entire ""Bullseye Step Into Classic"" series."
1,Textbook example of how NOT to write sentences,It is hard to believe a book this poorly written could make past the editors! There were so many run-on and incomplete sentences I had trouble reading it to my daughter. I can only imagine what my second grade daughter went through reading on her own. We will keep this book if only to serve as an example of how NOT to construct sentences. There is a year's worth of grammar exercises in this book.
3,Perfect for reading to a younger child,"I agree that this is not the finest book written on King Arthur, but it is one that can be read aloud, and easily enhanced by a grandmother anxious to read these legends to a second grader---- finding something appropriate for a young listener has not been easy!"
1,grammatical errors,"I purchased this book for my 7 year old daughter to read, but after paging through it I ended up reading it out loud, editing as I read. Throughout the entire book there are grammatical errors, to include, mainly, incomplete sentences, and poor punctuation. I am trying to teach my children how to read and write properly. I certainly do not want them reading something like this and thinking this is correct! Here is an example from the text, pg. 10. ""To fight with a sword and spear and dagger."" Our children need a better example of proper writing than this! I wonder if it was ever proofed before being published?"
1,Not a good example of writing for my students,"This book's grammar is terrible! I don't know how it became a published work. The stories are good and they entertain kids, but I was reading it with my students and was quickly horrified by the grammar. I hope none of them picked up on it.Here's a direct sample from the book, ""For seven days King Arthur and Sir Gawain rode through the land. They asked the riddle of every woman they met. Young maidens with flowers in their hair. Mothers carrying their babies. Poor women tending sheep by the road. Rich ladies covered with jewels. Some said that women wanted beauty. Some said love. Or wisdom. Or children. Or riches. Or Adventure. Or truth.""I'm pretty sure my second graders could write a story like this and get published with no problems."
5,QUIET!,"I first purchased this fan at work for my desk. I have since ordered two more for other people who have admired the style of the fan, the performance (rotates, oscillates, ionizes), and especially because it is so whisper-quiet. I have had and used the fan for two years and it still looks and sounds like new."
5,Great fan,It is very quiet and circulates the air nicely. I have it on my dresser and use it frequently. It is well constructed.
2,Lots of pictures,"I have about any art book imaginable and ordered this from an Artist International Magazine sales pitch. It has 100 different artists with no more than 20 sentences describing their ""technique"". I would not recommend this book for much other than seeing different paintings of different artists. And I hadn't heard of any of the painters at that."
3,Ok for what it is,"This book is ok for what it is, which is a collection of 100 paintings by different artists and a few tidbits they share. Inspirational, maybe to some. Instructional, not in the slightest. Tips... not that I saw, though I could have missed them.The book and paintings might offer some insight to those wanting to see what can be accomplished with the various mediums and palettes of colors. It might offer some exposure to differing styles. It's not going to teach much to most though. Still I find it well worth the (used) price I paid."
1,SHE LOOKS LKIKE A SKUNK!,"SHE REALLY DOES! SHE IS UGLY! ALL THAT THESE DOLLS WEAR ARE RED, BLACK, AND WHITE. THEY LOOK LIKE GOTHS!!!"
1,Kudos to Nessie,"I am holiday shopping for my neice and heard about these dolls, so I decided to give them a look. I have to congratulate little Nessie, age 11, in her review and her strength of character to see the classless nature of these Bratz dolls. Her parents should be enormously proud of Nessie - she has a great future ahead of her. These dolls do nothing more but reinforce the materialistic irresponsible culture surrounding the Paris Hilton's and Tara Reid's of the world. Why would any parent want to promote drug induced emaciation, financial irresponsiblity, and wild self centered lifestyles? My neice will never get any of these worthless dolls."
5,Hi Chelsea Churro and Sara(LGP3LNC here),Get Saaha.Why don`t you get a bratz princess?She (Jade) rocks so much she is on fire!These are her rockin` features this doll has:Rockin` instruments2 different outfits that oow and aw the stageand tons of make up and jewelry 2 glam up the stage.LGP3LNCEVERYTHING LUVERFOREVERIN ALL ETERNITYROCK SQUARED
4,Stop and think,My mom told be about this toy when she whent out one time and said the doll was the worst looking toy shes ever seen. This is a doll that as a tatoo and has a belly ring. This is plane out the worst doll I have ever seen. Do not Buy this doll for your kid... She looks like she has a skunk on her head mybe when you see the doll off line shes raly pretty but my mom will not buy it for me ever. So dont buy this for your kid. Oh I am 13 and like dolls and evey thing but not this doll.. I do like bratz and my scene. But in all fair ness Myscene was out frist. Thanks for rading my review.
2,Great doll but.......,I wanted a tattoo! and my jade doesn't have a tattoo. She is very beautiful though. Probably one of the most prettiest jades out there.
1,NO!!!!!You are stupid!!!!!!,"This doll is bad for little girls,and you think that having a belly ring and a tattoo is cool,so this is your problem.I hate Bratz and I hate everything else with them.This doll can teatch small children how to make bad things on thier body.In my dreams:I will never get a tatoo or a stupid belly ring.(...)"
3,"helpful, but unrealistic at times","First I'd like to say that Stone's book is good. It is not great though. I find her far to dismissive of many concepts that are the underpinnings of public policy. However, her insight and criticisms on those very same ideas help us think, even if I don't agree with what she is getting at. This is a very good compliment to a strong economics-based public policy book, but read as 'the' textbook for policy studies would be a big mistake."
2,Policy Paradox,This book is a dry read. You might want to consider this book if you have a hard time falling asleep at night.
5,A must have!,I love everything about this album. Wonderful variety of songs by the one-and-only Velvet Fog. I'm not usually a jazz fan but this is too good to be missed.
4,Two classics; Mel and the city he loved,"Only one way to say it: this is quintesential Mel. The Velvet Fog rolls into New York Harbor and gently takes you to all the old familiar places. A great recording for old and new fans of jazz and swing. The performance of ""Harlem Nocturne"" and the aching ""There's a BrokenHeart for Every Light on Broadway"" are particularly bright moments on tis marvelous record."
5,Mesmerizing!,"Gorgeous voice and song stylist. As a displaced native New Yorker of a certain age, I just adore these songs and this voice. Wonderful song selection."
5,Long time favorite,"I first saw this movie in an art-house theater in the late 70's, and it deeply resonated. I saw every remaining showing before it moved on, and have been searching for it for years. Probably just me, but struck me hard."
2,unhappy,"After many years of owning a traditional heating pad, the plug in kind. I wanted the convenience of a microwaveable version. Yes, it is convenient as I can use it anywhere in my home, the problem is: It doesn't get hot enough even after microwaving it double the reccommended time, it still isn't as hot as I am used to from my old heating pad. Diddo for the pilow I also purchased. I will stick to my old heating pad works much better!"
3,OK THE DOORS ROCK!!! BUT INTERVIEWS...,"For 20 dollars i would say this CD is not worth the money. First of all there is no Doors music on this CD just Jim Morrison talking, if anything buy a different interview CD or simply download these songs. Second off its only 2 tracks of talking thats it. Maybe buy it used but really its not worth the money unless you are a doors fanatic who needs every single recording made by the doors than i would say yes buy this, but if you're not than stay away from this CD. I'm a big Doors fan but i'm not buying this album way too much cost for 2 tracks!3/5 stars"
4,Highly recommended workbook & CD!,"This book is the Greatest. I used it in conjunction with ""Prep"" Program Review & Exam Preperation, also by D.A. Saia. Prep gave me a refresher review. The 4th edition w/CD-Rom was the backbone of my efforts. It is thourough and comprehensive. There are some errors in question answers, however they are minor. With 1,400 questions, all on CD, you can go over & over the material until you feel comfortable in all areas. After taking the ARRT exam I knew I bought the right books. I felt comfortable with the Computer foremat and although some questions on the exam were unfamiliar, I felt well prepared for the exam. I had been out of the field for 30 years. I graduated X-Ray Tech school in 1960. Dropped out of ARRT Registry in 1982. I passed my exam with a 89. I used only the the two books indicated and a current Medical Dictionary. Thankyou D. A. Saia! You helped to make it happen for me. I am currently employed as a Registered Radiologic Technologist."
3,"Good repellent, bad sprayer","The product worked better than the all natural Repel product, not as smelly, but it only sprayed once and then failed. Had to use the sprayer from an old Repel bottle."
2,You have got to be kidding.....,This game had some cool aspects but all in all it is not worth your money. i like to see my character on an rpg on a shooter its cool having the 1st person veiw but on here its annoying. the characters you met are really tight and well drawn but everytime they have something to say you just see a picture of them no mater if its good or bad. i give it a 2.
3,Fun game,"This is a pretty fun game, it kept me busy for quite some time. One reason i like this is the way you can build your character. You can chose from a few races, then depending on your race and alignment, you can choose your class. Another thing that sets it apart from other RPG's on the PS2 is how its in first person view. The battle system is brilliant and relys heavily on teamwork. A good RPG worth buying."
3,So so ...,"OK, but I got tired of it very fast and gave it away.The is out of your control too much. And as far as the graphics go ... um ... what graphics?! Don't expect special-effects either. I just found this game to be at the level of what used to come out ten years ago or so ... where these programmers sleeping all this time?"
2,This is a timewarped game,"I finally completed Baldur's Gate:Dark Alliance, during whichI had received this game. The manual looked like it kept theelements of the original games (which I even went back andreplayed last summer). While replaying the old games broughtback the enjoyment of playing them on the Apple in seventh grade,games of today are far too many and more fun to waste a lot of time on a game that in today's terms could only be considered repetive at best, and boring at worst. As with some of the previous reviews, the graphics and sound harken back to the daysof Wizardry four - the first ""graphical"" Wizardry. In other words, pretty poor. When I got the game I noticed that Sir-Tech did not produce it and assumed they had been bought out by this company. However, Wizardry 8 on the PC is out, and its produced by Sir-Tech. All of which is to say that don't waste your time. There are better games to spend the day away - such as Baldur's Gate or Summoner."
4,How RPG's are meant to be,"This is an RPG for true fans of the genre. Over the years the RPG format has been skewed for a less patient crowd with each game trying to add some flashy gimmik to impress those that have no imagination or patience. This may work for the easily impressed, but the true sense of adventure or character development is lost. If I wanted to play a game with button mashing to get some character combo I would play Tekken, not an RPG. A previous reviewer called this game a disgrace to the Wizardry series, but I disagree. While the story is different the game play and character devolopment is similar to the original series. This game is basically a dungeon hack similar to some of the original RPG's. I would recommend this game to any true fans of the genre who can get by with reading a dialogue without needing a video sequence to accompany it."
5,Great RPG,This is deffinatly one of the better RPGs that I have played. The character interactions are cool. The whole trust system and the group attack and defences are outstanding and add a whole new dimension to this type of RPG. One of this years best.
4,Another exceptional book in this series,"While this is not my favorite volume (story-wise) in the Young Wizards series, I continue to be astounded at the difficult situations that Nita and Kit encounter, the reasoning they use to solve their problems and the standards of behavior they apply in seeking the solutions. This episode's plot is particularly poignant. The characters are so well drawn, it's hard to remember that they're not real -- especially the humans! These books are not just for young readers. I do recommend that you indulge yourself in some of the prior volumes in the series before you tackle this one, but it deserves to be read -- and you deserve the chance to savor it!"
5,Oh God! I'm so excitied!,"2001 is an awesome year for well written fantasy, methinks. Not only is Meredith Ann Pierce publishing her first book in 5 years, 'Treasure at the heart of the Tanglewood', but Neil Gaimen has a book out as well, 'American Gods'. And now I get another Young Wizards book by Diane Duane? *swoon* I'm really intregued by the plot of this one. Diane Duane can be hit and miss at times, but her last couple of books were really great, and the reviews look good, so I shall look forward to this with all eagerness."
4,Wow!,"Having read all of Duane's previous wizard books, I found the fifth to be just as engrossing as the others. Nita and Kit are growing up, and it shows. When Nita's mother gets the news that she has cancer, the story begins to get complicated. Nita is faced with a horrible decision - after being tricked by the Lone One, she has a choice. Is she willing to save her mother's life by giving up all of her wizardly powers? Just when she has made her decision, Kit, along with Nita's mother, intercede to make a heart-felt ending that will move readers of all ages. Diane Duane is a fantastic author and The Wizard's Delimma is a great read!"
4,Good Once it got started,"Finally, after two dismal installments, the Young Wizards series is back on track. We are back to what the first two books did so well, a very interesting presentation of magice.And imprtantly Magic with a price. There is a lot in thsi story to get engaged with, and some real character development. At the end of the day there have been major perminent chagnes. This is a good thing.My only criticism is that the first 100 pages or so seems to be entirely concerned with subplots. The main plot doesn't really start until page 120 or so. Sure there are a few earlier hints but they are so subtle that you won't notice them unless you already know the plot.Everything did tie in at the end but it could have been sequenced a little better. I'm still giving it four starts though, as it is just so much better then the last two."
2,It's ok...,"This book isn't that good. Maybe I've just grown up in a technology-based society or something, but I thought the book was too slow. If I had known how meandering it was, I wouldn't have bought this book.My advice-if you read the first book and liked it, don't ruin it by reading the rest of the series."
3,Sigh- such a let down,"I loved the first four in this series, especially Wizard Abroad but I found Wizaeds Dillema dreary, I hated when nita was wrong it was sad when kit and nita where no longer the famous duo they'd become. Although Kits obviously a genius I didn't like him surpassing nita, And I found the ending unsatisfying, and unless theres going to be a sixth it left a lot of loose ends."
5,These are incredible books,"These books are some of the best fantasy ever! Some people say to read them if you've read Harry Potter...I say read them no matter what! The Wizardry books are on a level with Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy, only we get even more to enjoy!"
4,Its iight,"I've had my Coby Mp-C751 for 1 one day and ive found the few little problems about:1. Certain songs will not play if they are protected.2. The exterior feels kinda cheap.3. You can't drag and drop.4. Is not reconized by windows XP 03.The good parts:1. Great FM tuner.2. The earphones are off the chain.3. It's small and sleek.In other words, besides the few problems, It's a wonderful player."
2,Difficult to operate,"I bought this because of the form factor and so that my husband could record something he was studying for. Granted, he is not a puter whiz but he had a hard time getting the record function to work. Usually, I can show him something and it will work fine for him thereafter. He kept coming back asking me whether he was recording or not. Not a good sign. It is pretty cute, but the toggle buttons are very hard to operate, especially for my husband that has larger fingers. Basic tasks like moving thru menus are a little hard to navigate with the tiny toggle. And we often found ourselves entering a function we did not want because of that. The sound is decent and it was easy to setup and transfer files to."
4,Ratt - 'Out Of The Cellar' (Atlantic),"Originally unleashed in 1984,'Out Of...' was the band's stunning debut effort.Never really cared for the term 'hair band'.That makes it sound like a bunch of guys that can't really play that come out onstage every night and fluff their hair around - like Danger Danger and Trixter.Ratt,at least for the first three lp's played some seriously good '80's heavy metal,I always thought.Tunes that more than make the grade are ""Wanted Man"",the old MTV favorite ""Round And Round"",""Lack Of Communication""(my personal Ratt favorite),""Back For More"" and ""I'm Insane"".A true classic.Recommended."
3,Ratt's in the Cellar,"Being a total hair metal fanatic, I had high hopes for this album. But it turned out to be very...average. It boasts four AMAZING songs in Round and Round, Lack of Communication, Back for More, and Scene of the Crime. Each of these tunes boasts hooks that drill inside your head and keep you rockin'. But the rest of the album is made up largely of bland filler that all sounds pretty much the same and doesn't really stick in your head all that long. It's pleasant hard rock, but not much else. The above four tunes are all you really need."
3,A FORMER RATT FAN,"OUT OF THE CELLAR SOUNDS GOOD, IT HAS A COUPLE OF GOOD SONGS ON IT. I'M WRITING THIS REVIEW IN RSPONSE TO A PREVIOUS REVIEW MENTIONING JOE PERRY. CROSBY AND DEMARTINI ARE OKAY BUT A PERRY THEY ARE NOT.AND AS FAR AS GUITAR LICKS ARE CONCERNED, IF IT WERE NOT FOR JOE PERRY THEY WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT A GUITAR LICK WAS."
2,stryper is much better,"stryper's costumes and hot guitar licks are much cooler than ratt's. i mean, what's up with the lead singer's sissy combover. motley crue and nelson are also more talented artists. save your money on this album and purchase nelson's ""after the rain"" instead."
2,Not a remaster!!!,"I've been waiting for a long time to see ""Out Of The Cellar"" remastered, checking for such quite often. Imagine my delight when I saw the disc on Amazon as ""Original recording remastered""! I immediately fired off an order. Now imagine my chagrin when I received the disc only to discover it to be the exact same crappy sounding original release I already have! Fortunately I didn't remove the shrink wrap - Back to Amazon it goes..."
4,Introducion to Ratt........,"This is the first album I heard from Ratt. And it certainly doesn't disappoint. Ratt was always a band with sleazy lyrics & sound. Along with George Lynch, I think Warren DeMartini was a underrated guitar player. Steven Pearcy was a perfect frontman. He didn't have a really great voice like other lead singers, but it fit Ratt's music very well. This album started the band to stardom. ""Round And Round"" is the obvious huge hit here. It remains Ratt's signature song to this day. ""Wanted Man"", ""You're In Trouble"", ""Lack Of Communication"", & ""Back For More"" are the other nice tunes here. One thing I have noticed with Ratt is most of their CD's have little to no filler. A lot of the songs may sound the same, but if you like their sound, then you won't have a problem with most of their tunes. I recommend picking this one up. It's one of their best."
5,Out Of The Cellar rocks!,"I'm not really a big fan of Ratt. I'm basically a hardened metal fan and Ratt is less heavy for me, but I must say that Ratt is at their absolute metallic best on this album. It's another one of my top 5 favorite albums. Every song on here is my favorite, but my favorite songs altogether from this disc is Back For More, In Your Direction, She Wants Money and Scene Of The Crime. Just this album is one Ratt album enough for my metal collection. Recommended."
4,"Lacking depth, but still great metal.","Anyone who thinks this is a ""poser band"" or ""glam band"" really doesn't understand metal music or it's birth. Ratt, and specifically Out of the Cellar, represent the real birth of metal hitting mainstream in mid-1987. For those who have just heard it in 1999, listen and learn. From the beat to the guitar solos, this is the first real metal album to crack ""top 40"" as it WAS known. A definite must-have."
4,More than hair,"Though there were a lot of ""hair bands"" in the 80's, many people mistakenly assume that this was the choice of the bands. The record companies made the decisions about hairstyles and spandex, not the bands. Unfortunately, too many people make decisions based on looks or what they hear on the radio. Ratt's music was and is worth listening to. Though they do not even come close to anything approaching a ballad, their music is well crafted. Some may complain that it is not ""serious"" music merely because it does not have the dark timbre of metallica or pearl jam -- these folks lack objectivity. Out of the Cellar contains a number of solid songs, including Round and Round (which is the most overplayed), and Wanted Man. Also check out Back for More and The Morning After. A good first effort, this album would set the stage for the next. If you're not afraid of loud solos and guitar work, it's worth the twelve bucks."
5,RATT and Roll,"It was a great album when I owned it as a cassette,now it is living on in my collection as a C.D.Amazon delivered as they promised. They C.D. arrived quickly and in excellent shape. I would use Amazon again and suggest its services to all looking to order online. Especially to those ordering to update their 80's collection. They have good deals on the C.D.'s when I ordered."
4,Ratt Out Of The Cellar,For any Ratt fan this is a must. I enjoy every song on the CD and believe this is the best of what Ratt put out.
5,what started it all,I wouldn't consider this glam. More Hair metal.One of the best bands in the 80's. Still love this album!!
3,HAI Flat iron,"I have previously used a Chi hair straightener and a Hot Tools one. The Chi was a much better flat iron compared to the Hot Tools one as I did not feel my hair was damaged as much and was very easy to use. I purchased this (HAI) after reading several good reviews. Although this flat iron does straighten my hair, I feel that I need to go over the same area twice to get it very straight. I have thick hair, which is naturally almost straight but has a slight wave. I don't feel that any hair straightener should take more than one try to get my hair straight. So, given that this one is taking more time and effort than I would have expected, I would give it a 3 of 5."
5,excellent straightener. works perfect.,I owned this straightener and dropped it about 100 times. It still worked but would turn off unexpectedly. I really loved it so I bought another one exactly like it. The price was about half what I paid for my first one. It arrived in one day without special shipping!
4,Recent purchase,I love this Flat Iron- I went to visit my BFF in Vegas and fell in Love with hers... Came home and placed my order!!!
1,Not as impressed as others,"I bought this product about a month ago and was very pleased at first. About a week after having the product it stopped getting as hot and stopped straightening my hair. Overall this product left my hair looking awful. I was very excited to get this product since the reviews were so high, but ended up being very disappointed."
1,Quits After Less Than 12 Months,"I'd read through the reviews before I purchased this flat iron. Unfortunately, the flat iron stopped working after less than 12 months. I never wrapped the cord around it .. (I'd read in the reviews not to do this .. for whatever reason). However, it worked great while it lasted but I won't purchase another. I'll stick with the regular Chi which has never gone out and I've had it for 3 years now."
2,Not great.,"I have really curly hair, and this straightener really only damaged my hair completey and caused it to frizz up after an hour. My hair is so bad from the iron that I have to put my hair in a bun after using it to make it appear less frizzy. It was a good product at first, but after a while it made my hair worse. Note: I only straighten my hair one day a week and leave my hair curly the other 6 days, and my hair still gets fried. This straighten does, however, work well for my best friend who happens to have wavy hair. I suppose what I am saying is that get 100% ceramic plates(this one is not 100% ceramic) if you have culy hair like mine, or invest in this one if your hair is just wavy. This straightener does not straighten really curly hair. Oh, and the blue ceramic coat scraps off after a month and causes the metal underneath to become exposed... which is probably why it kills my hair."
5,great for the price!,"This is a great flat iron for the price. In my opinion it works better than a chi,for half the price :) very satisfied"
4,Love it,"The only thing that would give it 1 more star is an auto shut off.. Other that that , my wirey, frizzy lid loves it!!"
3,Ok product,I purchased this flat iron a while ago and I had it for about 6 months and then one day it just wouldn’t turn on. I used it about 4 times a week and never had the heat turned up too hot. Not sure if it is really worth the $65 that I spent.
4,Love it... but beware of the blinking light,"I love this flat iron. I have had it for about a year and a half. The light started blinking on and off about a week ago. I kept having to jiggle the cord. It finally died today, but I love it so much that I am contemplating buying a new one."
4,Hai Classic Convertable review,"In an effort to ""break-it-in"" I've been taking it with me to my hair dresser, and she agreed to use it instead of the hot/stove iron. I really like the even heat transfer, and it makes my ends and hair silky smooth. I'm so glad she told me about this product. It's easy to hold and it doesn't burn the scalp when pressed against it. Great product!"
3,Hai Flat Iron,Hai is the only brand of flat iron I've ever used. This is my third one and the only one I've had a problem with. It does an excellent job straightening my very curly hair but it pulls out strands of hair because they get caught in the ceramic plates. The price is very reasonable for the way it performs - if it didn't pull out my hair I would give it 5 stars.
1,Died after 16 months,Bought this iron because it was a great deal and had fantastic reviews. Was pretty good for the first six months then the red light started flashing on and off and the plates kept turning off. At the 12 month point it would decide to turn on whenever it wanted to and now after 16 months its completely dead. Don't buy it.
1,No!,I purchased this iron after doing a lot of research. I found that they are heavy which i can deal with but the BIGGEST problem is that they pull and snag your hair. I tried using smaller sections of course which takes forever and mine and my daughters hair still got caught somehow. I put them away after purchasing them a few months ago and tried again last night-STILL NO good. Now its too late to get a refund so I will try to sell them at work or something!PS. the actual straightening part is ok its the snagging and pulling I cant deal with.
2,Not happy with this item,Does not really work well with longer or curly hair. Does not straighten hair at all. I was not happy with this product.
2,hai convertible flat iron,i really didnt like this flat iron. it doesnt get hot enough. i had a rusk flat iron berfore and that 1 is way better!
5,Love the HAI,"My first great flat iron was a HAI, but after it broke, I tried and CHI and one of those mall kiosk brands. Both were very disappointing, so I went back to the HAI. This is the only flat iron i've used that does not dry out my hair or make it frizzy."
2,Breaks Easily :(,"I don't flatiron often, so I wanted something that would be a long-term investment and when I first bought this iron, I was really impressed. But after only a few months, I noticed the plates were cracked and the cord connection was damaged- and for a higher-end/pricier iron, it was kind of a let down (not to mention safety hazard). I've been using my little sister's Jilbere 1-inch with great success and I think I'll stick with that for now, although I am considering purchasing a Solia in the near future if the feedback is positive."
3,Beware the blinking red light...,"My first Hai lasted about a year, the red light started blinking on and off, had to mess with the cord to keep it on, and then finally just quit. My new one lasted about 3 months and had the same problem.We purchased 4 at Christmas and the other 3 are still working...but one seems to be on the blink (pun intended).I'm giving up on the internet for this product. I will pay more to have the luxury of a warranty or exchange."
2,Hey Hai Ney,The ceramic coating on this iron started to wear off in less than 15 days. I am having to return it to One Stop for repairs. The previous iron bought was made in USA and had no problems. This one was made in China (?).
2,"Great Flat Iron, But Breaks After 1-1.5 years","I love, love, love this flat iron. It works better than any other one I've ever used. But it always breaks! I'm on my fourth one and its starting to stop working. And other people I know who use the same flat iron, have experienced the same problem. As much as I loved this straightener, I've decided to buy a different brand this time around. I just can't keep spending money on something that only lasts about a year to a year and a half. If they were able to fix this problem, I would definitely recommend this straightener."
1,What a disappointment!,"The iron worked GREAT for the time I've had it... probably about 11 months. I took care of it, cleaned it, didn't use it often. Today it would heat up and the red light was barely blinking. So sad. Now I'm looking at other options."
4,Think twice before purchasing this version,"I drive an airport shuttle van in San Diego. I've used earlier editions for three years, I've purchased the new programs as they are released as new features are added and I've been delighted with the upgrades. I was (past tense) looking forward to the addition of real-time traffic input. Sadly, I was unable to use the ""Connectwed Services"" aspect. I followed the instructions in the installation guide to no avail. It seems as if you have to ""activate"" the receiver on at least three different sites, none of which tell you that you are actually activated and none of which seemed to activate the receiver. I could not find ANY technical support anywhere. I gave it 4 stars as the basic program is still a delight to use and extremely useful for my application."
3,No Updates.,"This product is amazing for the price ($150): the features that it has and the fact that it turns your laptop into a GPS map with a very large screen. The GPS locater is extremely accurate. I did not find the software features intuitive but they worked well once I figured them out. However, the mapping software(ie names of streets) was not up to date and I discovered to my distress that it is not updatable until the next version (2009) is released. Microsoft has this in common with several other GPS mapping hardware and software systems. I returned it to Microsoft."
5,Christmas $$ well spent!,"I bought this with some Christmas money I received and LOVE IT! If you are truely a club-head or if you simply like to listen to trance, this is definitely a great CD. It has a mix of vocals (not too much to make it seem as if you are just listening to euro-pop) and heavy beats. It is not hard to imagine you are in a club while listening to this. I would rate each song on this, but what's the point as they all deserve the highest; therefore, that is the reason for my 5 stars...would give it more if I could."
2,Great intro,"I got this game when I was a kid. I loved everything to do with space so I thought I would love to play this game. Outpost starts out with a great intro about the end of the world. You play the leader of the last humans and you are on a mission to find a new planet. You start out by equipping your ship with supplies, picking a star to travel to and fueling up. The intro uses a great voice over and better graphics to make you get in the mood of the game.Here is where the problem starts.After all the cool cinematic and cool voice over you finally get to the colony building stage. This is the game you have been waiting for. Guess what? It's terrible. I had no idea what I was doing, if I was doing anything right. I built things that I had no idea what they were or what they did. It didn't matter what I did nothing happened. I remember trying to figure out what to do but I never did.This game had a great intro but terrible gameplay."
1,One of the suckiest games ever written.,"If your goal is to have a game that is absolutely no fun at all, this is your winner. I bought this back when it was released and sadly I didn't believe the guy in the store who was desperately trying to convince me to do something better with my money, like burn it or flush it down the toilet."
4,Scottish intrigue,"Marietta goes to Scotland to claim her inheritance. She finds that her elderly grandfather is under the sway of the charming Colm and the imperious housekeeper Mrs Drummond. On the way she meets Richard who is investigating the supposed suicide of his brother in the highlands. Marietta is not welcomed with open arms. As she delves deeper into the motivations of the people who surround her grandfather, she finds that all is not as it seems. Despite the formula of romantic suspense novels, Miss Heaven manages to make you care for the characters. This is high-quality romantic fiction with a few unexpected twists."
3,you have the right to remain silent is an awesome songs,I cant speak for the other tracks on this cd but you have the right to remain silent is an awesome song that brings back memories of the bar scene.
3,"uneven, worth it for a fan","There are some great songs here - On the Way Home (incredible melodic bass, perfect Buffalo Springfield pop rock), Questions (my favorite version, more interesting than the CS&N; version grafted to Carry On), I Am a Child. There are some fun songs like Uno Mundo, and there are some failures like The Hour of Not Quite Rain and Pretty Girl Why.Of course, we like what we like and ultimately that's all that matters. You may or may not agree with the individual song assessments here, but the point is, Buffalo Springfield is all over the place on this album. It would be unusual for someone to really like most or all of the songs here.But for a fan, it is worth having. You should end up with at least a few favorites."
3,60's collection,This cd completes my Buffalo Springfield collection. It also was necessary for my 60's collection. Fits in rather nicely.
3,Classic '60s band fades away,"Since the band was in the process of falling apart at the time, this is actually more of a ""various artists"" album than it is a group effort. But when those ""various artists"" include Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and Jim Messina, the results can't be all bad. The obvious gem here is Young's timeless ""I Am A Child."" But other contributions aren't too shabby either, including Stills' ""Pretty Girl Why"" and Furray's ""Merry Go Round"" (a slice of classic '60s pop that should have been Springfield's one last big hit.) Although not the tour de'force of their previous album ""Again,"" ""Last Time Around"" offers a glimpse of where each of these artists was headed and is still worth checking out."
4,The Soup Is Made From Scraps,"Ah, what could have been. The final Buffalo Springfield album comes up slightly short of their legendary second lp (Buffalo Springfield Again). If you didn't know any of the history of this record, you would find the breadth and scope of this record to be truly amazing, rivalling the Beatles White Album. Smart pop (On The Way Home), latin bounce (Uno Mundo), stadium rock (Special Care), beautiful country (Kind Woman), and Neil Young (I Am A Child) to name a few. They sould like different bands, almost.To know the story is to know that essentially they were 3 bands at this point. Stephen Stills did most of his songs by himself with studio musicians. Neil Young had little to do with the record except his tracks. Richie Furray and Jim Messina worked on their tracks.Be that as it may, throw this in your cd player and cruise on down the road. You're going to love the journey. And these songs and performances are so good, they are going to stay with you whereever you go."
4,Last Time Around is Bittersweet for the Springfield.,"Sad album to go out on. Still it is not that bad an album. While Neil Young practically is not present on the album, he does compose the excellent opening track ""On The Way Home"" which kind of sums up the Buffalo Springfield's vibe by the time the album came out; as well as writing and taking a lead vocal on ""I am A Child"".Other good tracks on Last Time Around include: Questions, Special Care, and what some people consider the first Poco song (or at least the Poco seeds were sown), Kind Woman.Stills and Furay both are experimental on many tracks such as Stephen's latin flavored ""Uno Mundo"" and Furay's classical piece ""An Hour of Not Quite Rain"".Not a bad album, but start with Buffalo Springfield's Again - that's their best."
3,Use of language is extraordinary but ...,"I knew I was in trouble when the first poem Whoroscope had notes half as long as the poem. I don't mind poems requiring multiple readings to be understood but I don't enjoy treating a poem as an encryption problem.On more accessible poems such as ""Vulture"" or ""Cascando"" the power of the language more than carried the poem - the cadence of the words being the characteristic first noted, then his play on words.Ultimately, the pleasure of the poems that are immediately accessible outweighs the annoyance at the poems requiring deciphering. Hence, I will probable read additional poetry by Beckett and encourage the brave-hearted to read this volume."
1,biblereader,"this is awful, angry, elitist, and boring. readers are better served by Brettler's book on reading the Bible. Mackenzie tries to be provocative, but it comes across as angry and condescending."
1,review of rome made easy,"On a tour of Rome with a group (church choir) I found this book to be useless. Unlike my other two Rome guides (eyewitness travel--nice pictures but heavy to carry, and rick steve's-- the one I used most), it did not do a good job of describing places, in my opinion. If it had not been so small I would have left it in rome, but brought it back and gave it to the local library where they sell used books and magazines as a fund-raiser. Perhaps if I had been on my own the suggested walks, etc would have been useful."
2,IT IS OK,"THE NAME IS GREAT, BUT THE ITEM IS SOMEWHAT OK. IT IS NOT 100% OK, BUT AT THIS PRICE, I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT. I COULD TRY TO CHANGE IT,BUT HOW YOU ARE GOING TO KNOW, THIS TIMEYOU WILL GET THE BETTR ONE. I TOOK,BECUSE IT IS FOR MY EVERYDAY USE."
2,"Not the best, not even close",This book isn't very good. The Passtrack is better. The best one to get is from Securities Training Corporation. They have 13 practice tests. I did all of the practice tests and got a 95% on the exam.
2,needs an update,"I used it for a ""first-pass"" review of the material, but some of the info is outdated. Also, found some annoying typos/errors. At least it's cheap, and *most* of the info appears to be correct. Hey, you don't need a 100% to pass...!"
1,Rough Draft,"While the content of this guide is certainly useful, it is far from complete with respect to the material you will need to know to pass the Series 7. In addition, the organization of the material is jumbled. In many areas it looks much like what one expect to see in a first draft, with paragraphs ""pasted"" out of place, and topic overviews in some instances ending abruptly (and prematurely).All in all, I suppose the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" would apply here. For $10 or so, it is a worthwhile investment for the quizzes and practice tests alone. However, I would not advise anyone to depend on this guide as their sole resource in preparing for the Series 7 exam."
3,just ok,"Has a lot of useful info, but not comprehensive. Plus I found at least 6 practice questions with misprints/errors."
1,WASTED MONEY!,"Horrible test prep book...This book assumes way too much knowledge. It is incomplete, lacks explanations and is scant on examples. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Horrible job. I will not trust Barron's again. DO NOT BUY. One star is overly generous."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This book was not very thorough. It is a good overview of what to expect and the topics covered, but do not use this book as a primary study guide for the exam. It might be a good book for someone who just wants an overview, but not for someone who is preparing for the exam."
3,First Step to Success,"I had previously disparaged this text as a poor study guide (in my PASSTRACK review), but now realize the book is well worth your attention if you are just beginning to study for the Series 7. The price is incredible. I would recommend this book as a starting point, however. Once your firm decides to sponsor you, you can consult thier much denser texts and go from there. I wouldn't recommend using the Barrons as your ONLY means of preparing for the spectre, I mean seven.Unfortunately, the Barron's hasn't been updated in 3 years, so beware. Additionally, I found some typos in the exam sections which leave one vexed and pining for clarity. Finally, the index needs to be expanded so as to facilitate ""quick searches."" Nevertheless, the Barrons needs to be commended for packing in so much material into 300 pages."
3,Good but not complete for passing the exam,"I am currently studying for the Series 7. While I found the material and test questions in this book helpful, I would recommend that anyone buying this book also check out other study materials and not rely solely on this book to pass the difficult exam."
5,Joy to the Heart,"I first purchased Evening in Venice on cassette, in a hospital gift shop. While caring for my loving husband, the music was such an inspiration for me to realise just how much he meant to me and the love we shared for each other. Even after his death it kept him close to me. The music is so touching and opens not only the mind and heart but the complete soul.I think Mr. Pandolfi is a genuius and a gift to life."
5,good,"They worked for finishing holes in my wheel hub on my 1997 volvo 850. I used ceramic bits to drill most of the way through my well hub then once the tip of the bit started to exit the other side, I finished the holes with these cobalt bits to avoid shattering the ceramic. One bit was good for two hole finishings. I bought some cobalt bits from home depot that were destroyed before they could finish one."
3,CD-ROM is absolutely useless,"This book is clearly written and is a good introduction to the field of wireless communication. I am giving it only 3 stars because the CD-ROM does not work as advertised (it boasts an e-book version of the book, which cannot be unlocked because www.llh-publishing.com seems to have gone bankrupt and does not recognize the unlocking code; also, an errata for one of the worksheets is supposedly available at www.shortrangewireless.net, which nowadays contains no information related to this book). $39.95 (reduced price at Amazon as I'm writing this) is too big of a price for what you get (one softcover book and one plastic coaster). If you're not concerned about the CD-ROM you should be in good shape, but consider paying a lower price."
4,First and only female of the Flipmode Squade is...,"ALL natural and hardcore. Trust me if you like Lil' Kim, Eve, Missy, or Da Brat you'll love RAH DIGGA. If you don't have the Dirty Harriet album go get it, it is HOTT!"
3,Didn't quite meet my expectations,"After hearing the single ""Tight"", I was certain that this album would be a banger. Months later after the release, that is not the case. There is nothing special about the lyrics or the production on here. Yes, Rah Digga has a few clever punchlines here and there, but it is nothing spectacular. Most of the songs that would have been on point, are spoiled with wack hooks. There are a few good cuts, but the rest is filler. Harriet Thugman(which is way too short), Tight, What They Call Me(Pete Rock-blessed), Lessons Of Today(Primo-blessed) and Handle Your B.I.(a dope hidden track with a sick beat that should have been included with the other songs on the album) are all dope, but that is were the buck stops. Rah gets props because she focuses on lyricism instead of selling sex, which is something that has become the norm for many female emcees. However, I hope that the next album is better."
4,WHY DID I SLEEP ON THIS ALBUM?,"This is a very cool album by Flipmode's reigning queen Rah Digga. I enjoyed almost every song on the album. The production was solid, and the beats are BANGIN! I didn't know this album was bangin' so hard and I still don't know why I slept on this album. I suggest none of you sleep on this album either because it is so active. The lyrics are all amazing and the beats are way superior. You will enjoy this album. Buy it, rent to it, whatever, just listen! My favorite tracks are the orientally seasoned ""Do My Ladies Run This"", the bouncy bounce flavor of ""So Cool,"" ""Just For You"", ""Harriet Thugman"", ""What They Call Me"", the Elizabethian flavor of ""Curtains"", ""Break Fool"" and so much more! Be sure to listen to each track in its entirety because they have hidden surprises. The Outsidaz really ripped on that one track! I give them pRoPs."
4,Now THIS is hip hop!,"Rah Digga is someone that hip hop needs, a REAL dope female MC!Mad females running around with rhymes about clothes and [men]. Digga? All she wanna do is rip up MC's! Their are some weak moments though, like the stupid 'Do The Ladies Run This' w/ Eve & Sonja Blade. The last song on the album (one of the bonus tracks) will have you like ""what the [heck]"" But other than that, she comes ""Tight"" WARNING: If you are not a true hip hop head do not buy this album. You will not here any Kelly Price hooks or lyrics.... All you'll get is ""Straight Spitting""!"
5,Excellent,"I was torn between which album to buy, Big Punisher or Rah. I'm glad I got Rah's album it's off the hook. I'll still get Pun's album but I had to give a new whilly a chance. I'm glad I did."
3,wrong time...,"Rah dropped here solo release at the wrong time. 1999 was a boring year, a low point in hiphop. It was basically the moment in time where everything had been done, the beats were dead, the flows dried up and everybody was waiting for a new 2pac. And Rah chose this year to release her debut. Bad desision... here we are a few years later, hiphop is revivaling like crazy, yet no-one seems to remember her. At the same time I remember this a being one of the better records of that year. too bad..."
4,Wonderful CD featuring wonderful productions,"I think that this disc is the bomb definitely. A female MC with firm skills. I think that the production is fabulous especially Pete Rock's joint which is so funky to dance to. I suggest that PR retain that sound for his next album definitely. Of course, the other tracks are fabulous especially Curtains and other songs with a classical music breakbeat which is part of the Flipmode Squad sound definitely. On the other hand, sometimes Rah Digga overkills the rhyme but I believe with her second disc I think that she will be tighter than ever! ;o) i recommend listening to the whole disc for its wonderful consistency... and anticipate Busta Rhymes...peaze, Prinz Alfie"
4,First Lady Of Flip Mode! <<({{[[RAH DIGGA]]}})>>,"For a minute, I thought female MC's were getting to predictable. They all were rhyming about what they got or how sexy they are. Then out of ""the bricks"" of NJ comes Rah Digga to slap me too my senses about female MC's. Not sense L-Boogey has a female MC had my respect as a true lyricist and not just taking the art (hip-hop) for a monetary gain. I have always heard her on the underground scene on mix tapes and soundtracks and she also was featured on the Fugees joint: ""Cowboys"" where she spitt the illest verse on the song. This CD is for us real hip-hop heads who enjoy head noddin beats with excellent rhyme flows. Some of my favorite tracks are: {5}""Do the ladies run this"", {13}""so cool"", {4}""what they call me"" and {6}""imperial"". I had to get this. Much respect to Rah!oNe"
1,Not my thing......,"After all the hype, I expected so much more, especially since Busta Rymes was working with her on this project(I really like him). I know this album was already 2+ years old when I bought it, but c'mon, a good album only gets better with time. In my opinion, the lyrics and the beats were missing something. Nothing stood out on this CD. I was really disappointed with this album and would like to get my money back."
2,Harriet has and off beat flow,If you want a lyricist go pick up common senses new joint harriets voice is annoying and off beat eve is a much better female mc but this album doesnt do it for me the tight single and imperial songs are wack slow and just flat out unlistenable if you want flipmode stick with busta rhymes and lord have mercy i dont know here delivery just needs work now when shes with flipmode she is more tollerable glad i didnt cop this.
5,soo good,"The woman says she is tighter than ""3 or more heads in a CRX."" I cannot find any reason to argue with that -- that says it all."
1,Anti Christian clap-trap,"For those who believe the Bible is 100% literal (it isn't) and who dwell on suffering self abuse, this book will help fit disperate and unrelated bits of shaky history into a predetermined and particularly ideological mold they may feel comfortable being poured into.But it is a history of a very STAID and stagnant Jesus--something he or what he taught was NOT. He was a radical liberal (even the New Testemant--written centuries after Christ's death admits to this), who challanged notions of church bound hierarchy's.It's a shame that organizational religion (like the Southern Baptist Convention) promotes disdain for what Jesus taught--individual personal relationship with Jesus and God. Not to mention disobeying Jesus' teachings by mixing their lusting wants for power (government) with their narrow minded brand of cultlike brainwashing."
2,Fun at first...then I'd rather do my own laundry,"I personally didn't care for it. Great concept and it was fun...at first. As others said, it was the same thing over and over. The only time the family interatcted with eachother was at the kitchen table. The kids were all ignored with no discipline. I wanted to get after them for messing up what I just cleaned (that's true life!)and I wanted a baby gate for those stairs. How those toddlers got up and down those stairs in their walkers without getting hurt is beyond me! The family was patient waiting for their meals. If it was Diner Dash, they'd get mad at the waiting and leave! Sad family of slobs. Yes, I'm putting too much into it but I don't think it was worth what I paid ($20!) I finished the whole game within just a few hours. What was those 3 lives for? I guess I was too good."
3,Too Repetitive,"It is fun, but like one other person mentioned it becomes repetitive, and you will get bored fast."
2,Too easy,"I found this game too easy, had it beat in no time with all kinds of time bonus's for completing it fast. A good game for pre-teen or teenager, not much fun for adults."
2,Nanny Mania too easy,"This game is fun at first and gets slightly harder with each task the Nanny has to do, but once you get to the most tasks; there aren't anymore. The timer also doesn't change, making this game very easy to beat. I didn't beat it, just got tired of doing the same thing every level."
2,redundant,"There are three stages to this game. Unfortunately, it's the same one over and over. You start off as the Nanny and then the Mother and finally the Dad. You do the same with all three stages. If they changed it up with significant difference in the scenarios, then maybe it would've been worth my $12.95. But the game was completed in one day. Hardly worth it or fun after the first stage. Save your money and go for Diner Dash or Cake Mania or Turbo Pizza. You can always download a trial version online. There's no special ending either."
4,"Great Walker, Blocks....","This is a great walker. My son has been walking for several months and could use this right from the beginning. When he was really unstable we did have to hold the front to keep it from flopping back though. You can lock the wheels to help prevent mishaps when you are not helping.My only real issue is the blocks. I like them overall, but it gives you 12 cylinder shaped blocks and only 6 rectangle blocks. Unless you are building a Colosseum, this ratio seems off to me. You can do a lot more with rectangle blocks and they are easier for young ones to stack. Also the pant can mark floors and walls - also the ""natural"" blocks have colored marks all over them. I find this happens with safer paint though and am okay with it.Overall I love and would buy again. Just wish the block ratio was updated."
2,Not good for a baby just learning to walk,"Every time my son tries to pull himself up using the walker, it tips toward him, even with the weight of the blocks. Same thing happens if he is walking with it and puts his weight on it the wrong way. This may be fun for him to cart toys around in once he is a proficient walker, but it is not stable enough for use now while he is learning. He is nervous about using it since it has tipped several times on him. He enjoys playing with the blocks."
3,great if you have a lot of space,great toy. very durable. only goes straight which is a little frustrating for our daughter because we have to follow her and turn it. I am guessing because of this it would be better for a bigger house. Nice blocks if you need them. Not enough space on the walker to put much else. overall for the price (compared to other walkers i think it is pretty decent).turns out neither of my kids liked this too much. Way too hard to turn. Would get a cheap plastic one and throw it out when done with it. Much more play value
3,No pulling up,"My 10-month old is constantly wanting us to help him walk by holding on to our fingers... for like three months now. He's started cruising more in the last couple of weeks. We are looking for something that he can pull up on and help him walk that is not us - my husband picked this walker up, hoping it would keep him occupied, but the first thing he did was reach up to the bar and pull it down to him, tipping the front of the walker up. He immediately knew it was not something that would support him, and hasn't used it yet."
3,Limited use as a walker,"I bought this toy because our little girl was walking only with assistance, and my back felt ready to break. However, since the wheels on this toy do not turn, she would get very frustated walking with it. It only goes straight. She is finally able to turn the toy now, but at this point she can also walk unassisted, so it is not very useful. However, she loves sitting on the tray, holding onto the upright bars, and getting pushed around in it. She also does enjoy loading and unloading her toys from the tray. So it is reasonably fun for her, just not a good walker at all."
4,Comes and goes,"We bought this walker when our daughter was 8 months. It was great for her to learn to walk with because you can adjust the tension on the wheels. Once able to turn corners, she stopped playing with it because it is difficult to manipulate since it is rather heavy. Now, at 18 months she zooms around with it again. The rubber on the wheels leaves skid marks on the hard wood, but it buffs out.The blocks are great for sorting, stacking, loading and unloading. It's a great walker to start out with, as it is safe and secure. (she also used to sit on the platform while I would push her around- good times.)"
5,a walker that encourages independence,"Our little explorer loves this. We have a 'baby jail' where he first learned to pull up, stand, then walk. This gives him the confidence to walk over greater distances with a little help and without falling over (as he does often in the 48 sq ft baby jail). He does get distracted by the blocks, wanting to play with them, but that's also nice as it's like hanging a carrot out in front of a horse. When he's all done walking, his reward are the blocks! :D"
4,Beautifully made toy,"My son is too young now to appreciate this toy, but he will soon I think. He can't walk yet, but he enjoys biting the wooden blocks. When he is older and can build things I think this toy will be even a bigger hit. Overall, it's a really well made toy, simple, sturdy, clean design."
2,Beautiful toy but dangerous for new walkers,"They call it a ""Baby Walker"" but it's really only for toddlers who are already walking. My 9 month old daughter is pulling up on everything and can cruise, but when she tried to pull up on this, she fell over. This is very dangerous. I am buying a Radio Flyer Classic Wagon, which is much heavier and can withstand being pulled on or pushed or whatever way a baby moves. I have to say I regret buying this toy."
3,"Good, except for turning","My son loves walking with this. I like that it has a speed control, and it was easy to assemble. Having the blocks on the tray is also a plus. There were two things that were not perfect. If my son pushes it from the wrong direction (aka from the tray side) it has fallen over twice. The other thing is that it won't turn. So I have to set him up in a straight line, down the hall for us. Then when he reaches the end, I retrieve him and turn him around. He had a plastic walker before this which I generally did not prefer, but he was able to maneuver it. This requires a little more attention from me to turn him around. On the plus side, I set up the blocks and send him towards them for a mutually fun game of bowling."
3,Good solid construction,"We bought this block wagon just over 12 months ago for my daugter's first birthday. It was a little difficult to get the tension in the wheels right so she was able to push it without it moving too quickly and getting away from her. She also could only go in a straight line with it, it is not easy for a little one to turn, but in saying all that it did assist when she was almost walking to be able to ""walk alone"" and it is sturdy enough not to tip unlike others I've seen. I also love the fact it is wooden, it is bright and colourful and both my children still play regularly with the blocks"
4,Very Good for the price,"This toy helped my kid get the ocnfidence to get up and walk. Initially it was a struggle to make him use it, but with a week of he decided to use it and soon he was walking on the side walk."
5,Wonderful Walker,This product is wonderful! It was heavy enough to teach my son how to stand up without the walker slipping from under him. He zoom zooms around the house and I love that we can control the speed. Highly recommend!
3,Love the wood but dangerous for early walkers,"We recieved this for my daughter's first birthday and it was just in time for her to start walking. I love that this toy is all wood and not plastic. Very basic. But BE CAREFUL. If your little one likes to climb this toy can be dangerous. It easily tips over with any weight on the handle. We still like it, but have to watch her like a hawk when she is playing with it. If she tries to use the handle to pull her self up, it can get off balance. Sometimes she will want to stand where the blocks are (backwards) and hang on to the handle. The toy is not designed to handle this type of weight distribution. I understand that is not the purpose of the walker, but let's be realistic, she wants to explore and play, and she didn't get a chance to read and understand the directions first.All in all, good, but be on guard."
3,Decent,"Not as cool as I thought it would be. My son likes it now that he can walk, but when he was just starting out, it would tip over, which is sketchy. It's hard to turn and steer, too. Also, don't even think about taking it outdoors, as it is very low to the ground. A heavier, more industrial-wheeled walker would have been my informed choice, but eh. It's cute."
4,Durable push toy,"This product is beautifully made and looks great because it's wood and not plastic like so many toys. My grandaughter was 9 mos. when we got it and she starting ""walking"" while pushing it right away. She loved it! The problem is that it's not weighted on the bottom so it can fall forward, back or to either side. So until your child is really walking, it's not completely safe. She's 10 mos. now and is starting to be steadier, so it's safer, but we still don't let her push it alone. She also really likes the small wooden blocks that come with it. And, since she eats everything, it's great that the company makes such a safe, ""green"" product. Great product, but wait til they're walking."
5,Old time good.,"This CD was excellent in my opinion because there is not a bad song on it. No ""fillers"". I enjoy listening to it when I'm doing housework, driving or just relaxing. Brings back many memories."
1,Ultimate Collection Percy S,"The first recording is okay, but the rest of the album sounds like it was a black market product. Don't want to ever play it again."
5,I love amazon,I love amazon. Products are always excellant and shipping is very fast.m This cd is awesome
3,scratched,"cd had acouple of skips .didnt except it. i understood was slightly scratched, but no skips"
4,Wintertide a WINNER!,"""Wintertide"" is a long awaited GIFT for those of us who know Michael and his music. For those who don't know him, his music is like spending time with good friends - easy, comfortable and always enjoyable. A pleasing combination of ""toe-tappers"" and instrumentals, and when the kids say ""I love you""... oh my... Nice touch! A labor of love come to LIFE! Give it a listen - you'll be glad you did!"
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Seldom have I seen a worse movie, I mean seriously, this was supposed to be a high-energy sports drama, instead it felt like watching a long music video. The soundtrack was great, Riley Smith was pretty good and always nice to look at, but besides that, this film was poorly written, badly directed, and the acting was nauseating. To say it was a piece of crap, would be an insult to crap!"
4,non broken,"the 1' inch air stones work great. non where broke, but they are like all small air stonesthey will brake at the air hose connection sooner or later."
4,"Well researched, supported, and presented","Breakthrough to Advanced Performance: Building Confidence Every DayAs a professional facilitator on productivity and performance, I am very critical of other presentations. I found this product to be well supported, well produced, and offered valuable information. In fact, I will use this product as foundational research. I will recommend it to my customers, in order that their leadership teams and employees, become more effective, efficient, and more productive."
1,Rice are scattered!,"i don't know what happened in the transportation process, a box of rice has been damaged,and the box is rice everywhere! 6 boxes of rice should be tightly packed together to post!"
2,I just ruined the Earth,"The actual cereal is fine, but why on Earth do I need individual packets of it? I thought I was buying the large box (like the one I bought at Whole Foods). Instead it was 12 boxes containing individual packets of cereal. Obviously I should have read the description more closely, but I'm sleep deprived. The carbon footprint on this is just insane!"
1,Indian Meal Moth Infested,"I ordered two cases of this product, and both cases were infested with the Indian Meal Moth upon arrival. I would think it was a rare case, or just a certain warehouse, but there are reports all over the net about this happening from multiple sellers, not just amazon. If you order this, I would recommend opening all boxes, checking contents, and moving to sealed airtight containers, so that you can return any that might be infested.Dispite the issues with the Bugs, the non infested ones I bought at a local store are a favorite of my 9 month old, he just loves the stuff!"
4,Love Earths Best,"I really love Earths Best, and have used only EB to feed my little one. This cereal is great, except I would switch back to plain flavor after this box is done. The banana flavor had a weird smell to it when mixed with the formula (similac alimentum), and also if you're giving it in every bottle, then it can constipate your baby. So as for EB regular cereal we LOVE it, but the banana flavor not so much."
5,Great and Organic,This oatmeal is great and organic. Much better price than Baby's r Us or Ralphs. Good ingredients. Would buy again.
3,good cereal but has box design flaws,"I keep buying this cereal, and then wondering if I should buy it again, only because I absolutely HATE the design of the box. If only they could change the box to something like Happy Bellies (a nice box with a tight lid that's easy to open and then keep hermetically closed). Earth's Best: please re-think your packaging and you'll have a superior product. I have twin boys and they like the cereal still, but I've just about had enough of 'fighting' with the box to open it ... and then end up ripping it so badly that it doesn't stay tightly closed. Maybe I'll simply change to the Happy Bellies cereal after all ... a few more bucks but hassle free and simply yummy."
1,DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WILL USE WITHIN A FEW DAYS! FAULTY PACKAGING,"The packaging is faulty and allows moisture into the cereal. I retained all packs in a safe, dry area (we do live in a moist area though). When opened packs to use, they were all so hard & stuck together from getting moist, you could barely even get teh cereal out of the box much less giving it to a baby probably wouldn't be a good idea."
4,"Great product, too much for one baby",I bought this because the price was right and I knew I wanted to feed my baby oatmeal & we had tried this stuff and she liked it. Turns out she only ended up eating about half of the boxes before she moved on to more solid foods. So...moral of the story...share with friends!
2,Not What I Hoped,"I bought this album after I heard Monte sing with Cesaria Evora and especially with Paulinho da Viola on YouTube. I had no knowledge of Brazilian Pop Music before I bought this album.This album is canned, processed, easy-listening music. For my taste, it lacks the immediacy and honesty I liked in the YouTube performances. She has a lovely voice, but I will not listen to this album a second time. It is fluff."
4,An emerging goddess of expatriate Brazilian music,"Marisa Monte is the 90s answer to Astrud Gilberto and Elis Regina. I strongly recommend this CD, which I consider her best. Check her rendition of Lou Reed's Pale Blue Eyes and you'll experience the intenstiy and fire of Brazil."
5,FANTASTIC,This CD is absolutely wonderful. It's one of Marisa's best works. It's one of those that every Brazilian music fan MUST have...I highly recommend it!
1,Please give me a break!,"Ok, the lady can sing, but I REALLY don't get it! Why do some Brazilians (and South American artists in general) insist on singing in English? Isn't Portuguese good enough? That's the only reason I giving Ms. Monte only one star."
5,Will seduce you,"Marisa is a huge star in Brazil and this CD personifies why.She has the most incredibe voice I have heard, (yea - better than Ella, and Cesaria) for me!I have all of her CD's - this is my favorite"
4,"Beautiful, haunting voice","I first heard this singer while visiting a friend in Recife, Brazil, and was immediately hooked. Although I don't speak a word of Portuguese, I was drawn to the sound of Marisa's voice, which is crystal clear and very haunting. The music combines jazz, pop and traditional Brazilian rhythms into a wonderful melange that downright forces you to sway. With each listening, this album grows more complex and more engaging. Highly recommended."
5,The best pop album I've ever heard,"I am a classical musician and was on tour of Brazil in the late 1970's, where I developed interest in the rhythms of traditional and pop music of Brazil.Years later, I heard Marisa Monte's ROSE AND CHARCOAL and like most others who have written, was absolutely entranced. Her voice, her pronunciation, the arrangements. It is the best album of popular music I've ever heard. Unlike an other reviewer, I find the first song, Carlinhos Brown's ""Maria de Verdades"" to be hypnotic; the marriage of a beautiful soulful voice, lyrics, and instrumentation just doesn't get better than this.This transcends music to the realm of dreamtime and Monte's voice is like a breeze."
2,Wonderful idea but has battery position issues,Worked well for about half season and now having issues with battery positioning. If not set in a certain way (3/4 way inserted) it goes off. Embarassing when you look down and it has turned off. I have had three of these with same problem on each.
4,Amazing For The Price,"I was looking to get speakers for a 16x18 size media room in my basement. I have already experienced shopping for ceiling speakers for my upstairs common room. I went with very high end speakers having a company install ""speaker craft"" along with a sonos system. I paid $8,000 dollars and although they did an amazing job and the speakers can make the house shake; I did not have the same financing options for the basement. I took my chances with these speakers thinking that they were so cheap that if they didn't work, I can just give them away. It turns out that they speakers are awesome. I definately hesitate to turn them up to see what they can do as I am sure they would blow. But believe me when I tell you that I have them loud enough to impress most people who have not alerady heard the system I have upstairs. This was a killer deal and I wanted to share it with everyone!It is nice for a change to get a good deal on quality sound."
5,Awesom,I purchased 4 pairs of theese speakers and installed them in my family room (I only used 7) for a surround sound system. they were easy to install and ended up using 300 feet of cable. For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable. Billy Joel wasn't kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers. The frist thing I did was put Ice Age in the Blueray Player and the THX sound check was AWESOM. My wife who really could care less about thees things was impressed I don't think I will ever go to the movie theater again. I highly recomend theese speakers.
1,"Shallow bass, Inefficient, Would not buy them again","I purchased 5 pairs of these speakers for a new office install based on the 'great reviews'...huh? Are you kidding? I have to turn up a 100w/channel Sherwood Receiver to 2/3 just for background music driving one pair in a 8x10 room. With the bass turned to maximum my I-phone bass is almost as good. No umph at all. Midrange tin at best. They are ceiling mounted, and wired 'in phase'. Just pathetic sound!!!!In comparison I bought some Yamaha ceiling speakers earlier this year, a bit bigger and a bit more money but they absolutely are amazing. Flat tone settings incredible full range sound. Oh well...shoulda woulda coulda."
5,Great for price,"Installed these in a garage, had to do a bit of tweaking on the receiver but eventually got these sounding excellent. Very good sound for a very reasonable price."
1,Doesn't even run,"Our corporation tried installing this software on a variety of operating systems that it claims to support and all we ever get is an error that says ""class does not support automation"" and it quits. We go to the web site listed on the CD, www.typingtutor.com looking for a patch or update and just get routed to Simon and Schuesters main page, no patches, no support, no way for us to even use this product."
4,upon using the typing tutor,"Sometime ago, I purchased and began using the Typing Tutor 12 software. I must say that the software was a good tool in helping me improve my typing skills. The graphics and interface enabled to grasp my deficiencies and improve upon them, besides, it actually made the entire process fun. I am even contemplating buying the Typing Tutor Junior for my kids so they get a good foothold and are able to develop their skills faster. The best feature I liked was the flexibility to use it on both my PC at home and my MAC at work, something I gather the others don't provide."
5,I agree: This is an 8-star,"When I first heard Vocalese I admit I drowned in the amount of notes that are being played. After a few times it grew on me and took me by the horns. I played nothing but this CD for over half a year, and kept on hearing new things each and every time. It is an absolutely 'must-have' for every singer or musician in the area of vocal jazz. THis is the way to do it! They set the standard! You could compare it to Lamberts, Hendricks & Ross, but much tighter, more diversity, better arrangements, cleaner, better bands/orchestra's... just everything! My all-time favorite album!"
5,cool man,"hey its the manhattan transfer, what can i say if you want to feel the music this is one of there best"
4,makes cooking fun,"This is one of my favorite vegan cookbooks! The recipes are very easy, and the book is fun to read. There is a pantry list of suggested items and a glossary to explain the more unusual ingredients. Also, there is a section of things you can make up ahead of time to use in recipes, like a baking mix or a spice mix. This small cookbook is packed with lots of good recipes and fun commentary."
2,just ok,"This book is easy to read and has a few good recipes. However, a tofu-lover will have a greater appreciation for it than others. . ."
5,Amazing Potential,"Me and some friends went out and got some packs in hopes of getting codes for the MMO. We unfortunately didn't get any (they are pretty rare), but we sat down and tried the game out. Now, I am a dedicated magic player with years of experience and thousands of cards and frankly I had more fun with WoW then I ever did with Magic. The game play is much faster paced and far more exciting. Team play is easier to do as many cards take into account games where more then 2 people are playing. IMHO, Wizards of the Coast could be in serious trouble.Pros:-Fast gameplay-Great team play-Most Heroes are balanced, some need work (Feral Druids/Shadow Priests)-Resources: MUCH better then Land-Amazingly Fun-Huge number of unimplemented featuresCons:-Non-MMO players won't appreciate some of the cards as much-Many restrictions on who can use cards-Huge number of unimplemented features-Only 300-400 cards so farOverall this is a great alternative to Magic, and I highly recommend it."
3,Pretty cool...,"The artwork on these things are amazing, I've never even played the game before, and I love this artwork, I can look at it for hours. This is some of the most amazing works I've seen in a long time."
3,Just ok,My son likes Warcraft stuff but this was just ok for him. It does not have the same effect as playing online.
2,Would have enjoyed it if I'd actually been able to see it,"I was pleased to see that Destination: Gobi had been released on dvd, as it contains Martin Milner, one of my favorite actors. But when I got the dvd and started watching it, it froze up around the 20 minute mark and wouldn't advance any farther. I tried it in two separate players and got the same result. I requested a replacement from Amazon and when I got it, it did the same thing, freezing up at the 20 minute mark and refusing to advance any farther. So I wound up sending the defective discs back to Amazon and I guess I'll wait awhile before getting it again in hopes that FoxConnect has pressed a new batch of dvds that don't have that defect...and I did contact FoxConnect to let them know of the issue, too. But what little bit I DID see of the movie, it was quite enjoyable, so hopefully down the road I can get a copy that will actually play and allow me to see the rest of it."
5,Sublime Disco.,"Sure, there's the critically acclaimed Risque. And C'est Chic is probably the best selling album in Chic's illustrious career. But there's something dark and deep about Chic's self-titled debut that separates this album from subsequent Chic productions. Take the two hits Dance, Dance, Dance and Everybody Dance. Despite their earnest call to boogie, the melodies work harder, taking you to darker corners of the club. A certain sadness prevails, as if predicting the Death of Disco. Est Ce Que C'est Chic is similarly melancholic - Norma Jean's childish vocals weave gothic stories around the cryptic lyrics. And Sao Paulo is a gem - one of the best and the most underrated Chic compositions ever - jazzy, chilled out and way ahead of its time. Sophisticated, sultry and sad, 'Chic' is Chic's best album."
5,"DANCE, DANCE, DANCE, DANCE!!!!!!!!!!","I WAITED FOR YEARS FOR THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL RECORDING TO BE ISSUED ON CD AND IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. ""YOU CAN GET BY"" IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DISCO HITS. WHEN I'M DRIVING I STILL PUT THIS DISC IN AND RIDE ON. I'VE PLAYED IT FOR SOME OF MY YOUNGER FRIENDS AND THEY THINK IT'S AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WAS BACK IN THE DAY. THE CD IS A DISCO CLASSIC."
4,Very Good Music,"This Album Showcases the Start of The CHic Sound.&what a Sound it is.Classic in the Pocket Bass&Guitar, tight drums&other instrumentation.this Band Created alot of Styles.they were more than a Dance Band.the Arrangements are really strong.The VOcals are Good as well.Worth Checking into.ALot of Fun&Groove."
1,"I love the arcade versions, the GBA version stinks!","This collection is a disaster I'm afraid. I have a real Defender machine in my kitchen and MAME is the only thing I play on my PC, so I know about these things!Defender is a poor re-write, unlike the faithful reproductions (emulation?) in the Namco Museum cart. Defender's movement and ""physics"" are all wrong - very poor indeed.Robotron is unplayable because there is no way to lock the direction you fire in (ie you can't fire backwards) - Jeff Minter came up with the simple idea of holding down the fire button to lock fire in a certain direction - shame these guys didn't copy the idea.Joust seems like the most faithful reproduction, but maybe that's because I play more Defender. There is still plenty wrong with the Joust game as well :-(Sinistar is too fast to play, but I am not an expert on this game.I am a serious retrogame freak, but I'm going to take this piece of garbage back to the shop!"
1,Don't waste your money,This is a very poor conversion. The games play way too fast. There is not enough detail on the screen. There are too few options to set. The GameBoy Color versions of Joust and Defender are SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER.
4,Not Nearly As Bad As You've Heard,"Ok, this pak is not perfect. But I am enjoying it very much just the same. Some of the physics on Joust are a little bit off, and Defender has a couple of twitches here and there. But overall, it gives me just the shot of nostalgia I'm looking for when I power up the GBA. This collection, together with Namco Museum, and the upcoming Atari Anniversary collection will make this the ultimate time machine for those of us who remember the 80's as something other than the decade we learned to use the toilet by ourselves."
1,Kind of a Bummer,"I agree with most in here, I got the pack for sinistar, thought it was malfunctioning and took it back only ro find it was messed up on all.It appears to be a programming flaw. I'm going to try to contact co. and see what they have to say.The other games worked O K but not as good as they should.If you want to play these games, you can anytime for free on midways site--[...] From their home page, click the ""play classic games"" tab on top menu top. then pick which game from next page. All 4 these games are there plus few others."
2,Little replayability,"I have played these games in the arcades (I owned a ""Pong"" home game when they were new, to give you a reference), I also played these on the PS. The MAJOR problem is that you dont have the dual joysticks like the arcade, thus a game like Sinistar(which I popped a lotta quarters in, by the way in the arcade you have a short life in that game!), is almost unplayable. You have little chance in Robotron , and you can't fully enjoy Joust. If I could'nt enjoy them on the PS, I'll pass on the GBA with a tiny unlit screen! Nice try but I'll save my 20 bucks and pass on the frustration."
4,For Mad people,"In this CD you can find music history, you may think Unbelievable as their only hit, but there are more EMF classics on it. It's madchester sound with House synthesizer makes you feel the rave on almost all their songs. You can bring back your memories with this forgotten Album"
2,smaller than expected,"I didnt expect high quality for the price, but i did expect it to work. the shovel is smaller than i expected, about the same size as a hand held garden spade. the saw and axe had to be sharpend. it comes with a cotter pit that has to be bent to be used, i replace it with a clevis pin. i had to alter the handle and axe head because the hole was too small for the handle. and i wouldne even used the hammer for tent stakes in sand. a little quality control would go a long way on this one. the cary bag is good, not great, just good"
2,Wow is this a let down.,"OK, I was not expecting a milspec quality product, but I was hoping for something that could cut through a piece of meat. Seriously, this thing could not possibly be flimsier and be made of metal. The saw is so flimsy it bends in one's hand. The ""hatchet"" head is about as sharp as scissors we had in 3rd grade (and could run with). The case is super-thin material. This is good to give your kid to play with on the beach. Do not count on it for any real-life tasks."
2,Small price for Small item,"This is good if you go luxury camping (with a tent, etc.).This thing is tiny. I bought it to bring backpacking/survival camping and found it absolutely useless. Everything is soo small. I suppose it would be better than nothing, but i would rather bring a real hatchet and actual military shovel.Also, Mine didnt have a compass."
3,not bad,"Small and light weight, I guess if I needed a survival tool this would work. I thought it was great for my child, as just a folding shovel."
2,Oh well,"It is exactly what it says except it is tiny-mini-smaller the a flea. Okay so that is a slight exaggeration, but one of those descriptives belongs in the title. It is about the size of a hand trowel."
1,"I never review, but this was so terrible I felt I had to...","I bought this because other reviews recommended it, DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!!! THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAPLY MADE. I bought this because some reviews said it was decent, but they were wrong. The hatchet is a piece of crap (could barely cut through cardboard) and after using the shovel a few times the pin that holds all of the tool heads on the handle becomes loose and makes the entire tool useless. DO NOT BUY!!!! the only useful part of this thing is the compass. Save your money and buy a nice hatchet, a foldable shovel from an army surplus store, and a compass from anywhere. You'll end up with way better quality and the same stuff."
3,Ok,"Smaller than anticipated, The saw is cheap I probably wont use it, the shovel and pick probably is the most common used. not bad for the price."
5,xmas present,"It was for my nephew(who is 10) for Christmas, he is quite the outdoors man, and when he opened it, he lit up like a light bulb. He loves it and it's not left his side since. The shipping was reasonable and it arrived quickly. Thank you for helping me make a little boys Christmas."
4,E-tool,For the price you can't beat it. Sturdy enough construction. Used mine till I lost it in the swamp. Reckon I will get another one. The carrying case is a little cheap though. But that is not how I lost mine.
1,horrible,"the only thing good on this was the shovel. Th saw was not sharpened and too flimsy. as soon as i tried to use the axe ,two hits and it was bending."
3,Size is deceptive,"I was looking for a compact shovel assembly to stow in my Jeep for use with the need arises. The handle of my current shovel broke and I wanted a neat compact unit. This set up greatly failed to meet my expectations. While the unit is fairly sturdy it is not conductive for my needs.If you are searching for a very small, light weight, approximately 12"", multipurpose shovel tool, this unit is for you. If you are searching for a heavy duty, full size multipurpose shovel tool, this unit would be more appropriate: Handle-All"
1,Bad enough to make me write a review,"Ive never written a review until I bought this. Its just horrible. I sent it back almost instantly. It is weak. the ""R"" pin that holds the pieces onto the handle is thinner then a hair pin. The inter-changeable heads are replaced at the top making it just dangerous to use.Also the hatchet like attachment is just shaped that way its not even sharpened.Really just disappointed..."
3,Didn't like nearly as much as Sound Medicine: Music for Healing,"This CD is a series of piano chords and trills, which for me personally didn't have nearly the healing and transcendant effect of Mr. Halpern's Sound MEdicine: Music for Healing, which is much more synthesizer-y and (to my mind) cosmic - and which I love and listen to daily."
5,Relax people...,"Enough about the title! This is an outstanding book with a straight forward and, dare I say it, ""user friendly"" format. Unbutton your top button on your shirt and just focus on what God had them do. For all we know He ordained the title. Folks, this is a great book to explain those little things we have a hard time talking about and reminding ourselves about why we follow Christ. Get past the subtitle and into the book. Also, use it with a Bible... :o)"
2,Not As Good As The Others...,"Let me start by saying that I am a *HUGE* fan of Bruce and Stan's work...that is why I was so disappointed by their ""Guide To God"". True to form, it contains the same easy lessons and self-deprecating humor that has made the other books so wonderfully entertaining and popular, but the content is -- to put it simply -- very dull. The book itself doesn't actually reveal anything that even the ""youngest"" Christian doesn't know, though people who are relatively new to the concept of the Lord might benefit from it. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy reading it as I did ""Real Life Has No Expiration Date"" and ""Guide to The Bible"". Truthfully, the authors' attempt is noteworthy, but the overall result isn't anything special."
1,Poor,"When I first had purchased this book my attention was that this was going to be a good present for my boyfriend. The book stated that it was in new condition at a very reasonable price so I ordered it. Upon receiving the book, The book was in used condition! Not only was the cover of the book covered with black goo to show that this gift couldn't possibly be new but I was very disappointed that I couldn't even give this book to my boyfriend for his birthday. It should have stated that the book was USED. Therefore, I would have never ordered the book in the first place. I wish it hadn't turned out the way it did, I don't mean to put the seller in a bad position. Just hope that the seller in the future will make sure they are accurate about the quality of his or her products that are being sold."
2,The Others Were Better...,"I really enjoyed the previously work by Bruce and Stan like ""Guide to the Bible"", ""Real Life Has No Expiration Date"", etc., but I can't help but whine a bit about this particular book because it wasn't really all that fascinating. They try to cover a lot of ground in it, which is nice, but tends to be distracting to the matter at hand. Unfortunately, Bruce and Stan are still clinging to the old teachings and doctrine (for example, they still believe Moses wrote the Torah, that Satan was once an angel, that there was an angelic fall, and so on and so forth...) and this tends to spoil the overall enjoyment of the book as most of the older information lacks sufficient evidence and support. Still, it might be useful to younger people discovering God or anyone who is curious about the subject in general."
1,BIG problem with the format,"While I actually agree theologically with much of the content of the book. I have a HUGE problem with a ""User Friendly"" approach to God. I'm sorry, but God is not a computer or a piece of machinery. Jesus was not ""User Friendly"". To quote Proverbs: ""To conceal a matter is the glory of God, to search out a matter is the glory of kings."" God wants us to have to SEARCH, not find easy answers in a 'user friendly' model. My issue isn't with the content but the whole 'consumer' approach to Christianity."
1,"not a small book, this item is just a set of 15 postcards.","some are great pictures, yet not worth 15 dollars, at least in my opinion. i was expecting a small coffee table book."
1,POSTCARDS not PAPERBACK,I too missed the reviews at the bottom of the page - Amazon: change your description. This is not a book!I was wondering how I was getting H+DM book for under 15 bucks.
2,post cards ?????,"READ BEFORE YOU BUY THIS !!!ok.. so i ordered it thinking i got a great book at a great price... like my typical experiences at amazon.. but I didnt ever see anything denoting the ""paperback"" as being an unfolded pamphlet ( like an instruction manual quality ) and a bunch of postcards... hopefully i can return it !?!?.... in mint condition of course"
1,This is misleading,I should have read the previous review. We bought this thinking it was a paperback book on Herzog & de Meuron. You can imagine how disappointed we were that it was post cards. Now I have to waste more money sending it back.
5,bratz doll maker,oh my gosh i saw bratz midnight dance on the bratz mania doll maker its so coolgo here http://www.bratzmania.tk its the best bratz site and website EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
5,nice!,"o_O she looks pretty! and i like her clothes, she's so cute! i want her LOL in school we have all kinds of different people. my friend is a ""goth"". well somewhat. there are lots of goths and punks and girly girls, tom boys. all kinds of people. these are dolls that portray real people. please get over it. a doll cannot influence anyone to become anything. it's just a fun plaything! and i like the masks. keep ur uniqueness up mga!! keep the awesome dolls comin!"

1,An insult to the world of dolls!!!,"She is DISGUSTING!!! The only good thing about her is that to scare people away simply show them this doll and they'll go screaming! My friend, Lucy Banette, has this doll. The hair tangles, the clothes rip, and even she admits it SUCKS!!! Her white skin makes her look like a vampire ghost. Not one for decoration!!! Not even for a 'playing-with' doll. Too fragile and disgustingly sickening to look at! What are we trying to teach children here??? That it is good to dress like you have just died? Have you ever seen a goth look like this? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So please, MGA, carry on with lil' Bratz. THEY RULE!!! But NOT your silly gothy, punky Bratz. I have two lil' bratz. They are in the collection 'life style'. I have Sasha and Cloe. I don't know why you called Cloe Ailani and Sasha Zada. They are STUPID names! I HAD to redo their names! It feels nice to express myself! Bye, to goth haters! GO AWAY, you silly fans of this Bratty goth doll."
4,ENTERTAINING ACTION THRILLER!!,VERY ENTERTAINING ACTION THRILLER THAT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT!RUTGER HAUER GIVES A GREAT PERFORMANCE!!DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SEE IT!!THE PLOT WAS FULL OF EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT ADVENTURE!!
3,A not bad rip-off of Die Hard.,"When Terrorist (Lead by Andrew Divoff) takes over an International Sports Event and Taking the Woman's Swimming Team Hostage but it's up to a Trapped Janitor (Linden Ashby) to save the day with the help of the FBI and a Terrorist Expert(Hammy Acted by Rutger Hauer).Directed by Albert Pynn (Cyborg, Nemesis Series, The Sword and the Sorcerer) made a familiar action-flick... the Film is Surprisngly Entertaining but If it Wasn't for the Clusmy Writting, Direction and Bad Visual Effects. Blast could have been a Terrific Movie. Watch Close for Shannon Elizabeth. Clairmont-Scope. Grade:B-."
4,The best Crash Bandicoot game yet!!!,"This is an excellent game!!I think this is the best crash game yet.The graphics are super,the music is excellent and the challenge is good.The only bad point is that it takes a long time to load.But everything else makes up for it.Oh yeah and now coco is a fully playable character."
3,For the game nerd!,This game is very complex! Crash does die a lot! It is an intense game. Very hard for those that are only starters in game play! I'd say the other crash games are better! Well atleast it's on game cube!!
1,Crap,This Game is [bad]. The game is very hard.Crash & Coco Die 500000 times!Do not waste [the money] for this ... game.Crash's Bazooka fires ... fruit! Very hard to stay alive.Pros. - A 3D Mild Violent gameCons. - This game can be hard on some parts-Not a lot of fun-Can get boring
3,ok game,This game was pretty fun.It has really bad load times.there are 30 levels Most are fun.You face a boss every 5.And you cant get the game to work somtimes.You also get powers like double jump. It took me obout a month to beat all the levels.But Im still only 46%The bottom line is this game is fun but almost ruined by load tomes and not getting it to work
2,fgm,"If you love LONG load times, this game is for you.I have all the Crash Games and really looked forward to the release of this game when it came out for PS2, but was seriously disappointed. Naughty Dog would've done a much better job with this game ..."
2,HARD!!!,This game is too hard.It's more hard then it's fun.Nughtydog and Nughtydog only should make Crash games.If you want a game that is beatable this isn't the game for you.I wish I wouldn't have bought it.
1,Smart Strategy By Sony,"Crash died years ago. The original should have been the first and only. Sony even realised these games were garbage, and sold the liscence to Konami so they could produce this game on Xbox and GameCube and let them suffer low sales. Good idea on Sony's part. If you still want to get this game, bang your head on the wall and stop thinking about it. You'll one day thank me."
3,"Good game, but hard","This Crash game is not as good as the others, but at least it's on Game Cube for a change. You can hook up the GBA game of Crash on it, and play it. You still have bonus stages, and stuff like that. I would recommend this game to people who have never played the Crash Bandicoot series before. I can not get past the second boss."
2,Bad game,This game stinks. It always crashes and takes forever to load in and out of levels.some levels are fun but most are boring. dont get this game it is a piece of junk
4,captivating performance by Sandrine Bonnaire,"Perhaps undefinable charisma might best describe Bonnaire in this film. Varda directs with a sure hand.Film stays with you long after it's over, just as the best ones usually do. The French have a knack for this type of layered storytelling and aren't afraid to do it at their own chosen pace.Sandrine Bonnaire isn't the most beautiful actress to have ever appeared in films, and yet what she does here makes her far more appealing and interesting than so many women who are way better looking. That's why I say it's not easy to pin-point her charisma, but it certainly can't be denied."
3,a very interesting film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film begins with the discovery of a dead young hobo woman in a ditch. The rest of the film is a retrospective of the events leading to her death as told to the police by people who had seen her. The film style reminded me of the Japanese film ""Rashomon."" The original French title of the film is ""Sans toit ni loi"" which means ""Without roof nor law""The Criterion DVD has no special features."
3,Vagabond,"This movie, in the tradition of other French films, is pointless and mundane. The characters lack any development and the storyline suffers from basic stupidity. We follow a vagrant girl, Mona, who doesn't seem to have any direction in life and no real purpose for being in a film. In this respect, her character mirrors to actual film. You watch and wonder what is the point?She seems to always find a source of food though she has no job and no desire to leave her vagrant lifestyle. She smokes like a chimney and never seems to bathe or change clothes. She's not respected by anyone she meets. Then the end gets real weird. She's attacked in a village by tree people who seem to genuinely scare her (at least she screams when all the other odd-ducks she met didn't seem to phase her). In the end we presume she freezes to death which at least mercifully allows the film to end.French cinema leaves a lot to be desired and this film fits into that mold perfectly."
1,Over-rated and tiresomely boring film,"You'd think this film would at least appeal to our sympathy. Unfortunately, it's unbearably slow, so that every time she's even remotely near a ditch, you hope that something comes by like a stray football player or an eighteen-wheeler and kicks her in. This film is sentimental, horribly filmed, and punctuated with dialogue that is far from engaging. Read Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles before you see this dishonest thing. The only sympathy this film evoked was for myself - I felt sorry that I wasted two hours watching it."
5,Even Better than the First!,"Libbra Bray did an excellent job mixing, adventure, fantasy, romance, and comedy into one book. The book, although seemed predicting, took some odd twists and suprising turns. Bray worked to incorperate actual myths along with those that she made up. The novel goes from a boarding school drama to an intense mystery-fantasy.Great for any teen-age girl fond of fantasy and supernatural stories!"
4,Amazing sequel,"As soon as I finished A Great and Terrible Beauty, I ran out and got Rebel Angels! Thank goodness that it had come out 5 days before!! I really enjoyed this book, the characters were very real, the plot was twisting and keeps you holding your breath till the very end. The ending is also such that you praise Bray for having made this story into a trilogy, so you know that the adventure isn't over quite yet. If you liked A Great and Terrible Beauty, you are sure to like Rebel Angels as well."
1,Can't recommend it,"I read this because I work in a bookstore and am often asked for recommendations. Based on reviews here, this is wildly popular.I may have grown up on Nancy Drew and Laura Ingalls, but I realize times have changed. Even so, I won't be able to recommend a book where one father is a child molester and the other an opium addict. This book could have stood without those subject lines. The trouble with bringing in the molestation issue, is that it should have been resolved in some way. Instead, the victim makes her friend keep her secret then they just go on about their business, and each go on back home. You can't mention a subject like that and then just let it fade off as if the author forgot she brought it up. I just found it disturbing."
4,Ohh what fun,"This second installment was much better than the first in my opinion. There was much more action and excitement, and absolutely more intrigue and mystery. I also liked that there was a love interest for Gemma. Well, maybe 2. I will most definitely go on to the next!"
4,the best of the trilogy,"I was not that fond of A Great and Terrible Beauty, but it did have that otherworldly aspect that I liked. Since I was in a reading slump and have sworn off vampires for a month AND nothing seemed to peak my interest I decided that I would give the Gemma Doyle trilogy another go.Rebel Angels was okay. I liked that it explained much of what was missing from the first, why Gemma is the most high, who the other members of the order are, more details of the Rakshana and more description of the realm itself. I like the gorgon, Kartik and think Simon was a very respectable suitor for Gemma. I like the struggle between good and bad, those with power and those with out, and the whole destiny versus choice argument. BUT, it just is not my cup of tea. Go figure.Will I read the last book in the trilogy, The Sweet Far Thing? Yes, but I am not sure when. I really would like to see what becomes of Pippa, Ann and Felicity and the relationship between Gemma and Kartick."
5,This was Awsome,The sequel was fantastic and suspenseful. Lots of points in the book had me on the edge of my seat and other parts i was like NO WAY. Great book i'm starting the third one and i cant wait I hope its just as good.
3,fairly petty and poorly written,Not a lot of depth to the series. Predictable. Nothing inappropriate if you want your daughters to read it but don't expect it to hold your interest.
5,What a wonderful novel!,"I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much from this book. Its prequel, A Great and Terrible Beauty, had been good but not great. However, as I progressed into the book, I realized that it definitely exceeded my expectations. Bray really did a good job on keeping everything in the plot as tight as possible-- I didn't lose interest on a single page. The characters now have more depth, than from the first book, and as a reader, it is easier to understand many aspects of the characters' lives. The plot is intriguing, and you are left wishing for more pages, once you reach the end. This is the perfect reading on Victorian England, mystery, romance, and magic."
3,Rebel Angels,"I thought this was a pretty good book. Only pretty good because i feel like it started out really really slow. It was... boring for what seemed like the first third of the book. I also thought it was pretty predictable, i could guess things that were going to happen, and most of them did. Although what Bray did do right, she did really really good. When the book got really interesting, I couldn't stop reading it. While I said that I could predict some things, others I was completely surprised about, in a good way. I would recommend this book, but only if you can handle a slow beginning."
5,Impressive,"I enjoyed this book. It was a bit longer than I expected (550 pages seems like a lot for a young adult read); however, the writing was simple and easy to follow, so it didn't become tedious. The plot was very nicely designed. I enjoyed the first book as well, but this one was even better. This book is a worthy addition to the Gemma Doyle saga."
4,"Simply put, it was spellbinding.","I believe I liked this one better than A Great and Terrible Beauty. The writing was better with longer sentences and more variety in length and language. There was more story; with a thicker and deeper plot that was somehow very alluring like the Harry Potter but written with a superior skill to J.K. Rowling. Simply put, it was spellbinding."
4,Great series!,I read this quite a while ago so I don't remember specifics exactly.I know that I really enjoyed it as a follow up to the first book. If you enjoyed the first one then I'd say it's safe that you'll enjoy this follow up.
4,the gemma doyle trilogy,"this series is a gripping read. it is set in the 1800's and has an equal balance of dramatic social scandal of that time and action including magic, life after death, and mystical creatures. this book is an intertwining display of romance, power, and action as the main character tries to find a place in her world, aswell as a place in the realms of afterlife and magic. entertaining for all ages."
4,this book......,is entertaining.....it took off right from where the first one ended.....it is well worth the money
4,Great YA read,Thought this one started a little slow but really picked up towards the end. I am looking forward to the sequel.
5,Rebel Angels,"The first one to me was sort of an introduction, and this one got way deeper and there was more action. I was thrilled until the end. Of course, I skipped ahead (I have a tendency to do that sometimes) so I knew everything beforehand. DO NOT SKIP AHEAD. I had suspected what I learned, but I was in way too much of a hurry to get to the end already!If you liked A Great and Terrible Beauty, you will love this book! I can't wait for the third book."
5,Maddie's Rebel Angels Book Review,"Rebel AngelsBy Libba BrayRebel Angels is the sequel to A Great and Terrible Beauty, a Historical Fiction novel set in the late 19th century at the Spence Academy in London, England.Gemma Doyle and her friends Felicity, a rich admiral's daughter, and Ann, a poor scholarship student, haven't been to the Realms in months when Kartik returns. He tells them they must find the Temple because when Gemma smashed the ancient runes, she released the magic into the Realms, a place between life and death. Gemma must do this while fending off Circe and trying to decipher mysterious messages from Nell Hawkins and the Three Girls in White. Like it's prequel, this book is written from Gemma's point of view.I would give this book 5 stars because it is absolutely equal to, (and perhaps even better than, If that's possible,) A GREAT AND TERRIBLE BEAUTY."
5,Very happy customer,This book was in great condition. It was for my daughter and she loved it. She finished the book in two days. I am a very happy customer.
4,I thought it was great,"I really liked this book, the story is great, the characters are colorful and I looked forward to each chapter. Highly recommended."
3,Runner's Opinion,"I purchased this MP3 player to use while running. Primary criteria were something small, relatively water (sweat) resistant, and simple controls. So far it has fulfilled two of the three objectives. Downloading music was very easy and straight-forward, but organizing the songs once on the player and figuring out how to delete songs, choose a file folder, and navigate thru the files is not intuitive. The player does everything that I would expect (for the price) but it just takes a while to learn the controls. Product description describes it in one place as having a rechargable battery, but somewhere else as using an AAA. It uses a AAA battery.Positives: Size, sweat resistant, good backlight/easy to read, AAA battery (does not have to be recharged)Negatives: No clip - lanyard that came with it poorly designed, cheap earbuds, difficult to skip forward while running (button is small and on the side of player)."
4,Very useful product,"Product is easy to use. Performance is quite satisfactory. Quality is good.I wish it came with rechargeable battery. and charging plug.Evnthough they dont recomend for use in car, I use it without problem but use it for just listening. Do not try to navigate files while driving."
2,item was damaged,"I received this item in a very timely manner, although when I opened it up the face part where the songs would display has been damaged. looks like it might have been heat damage of some sort, the display will not work."
2,DON'T BOTHER,"Cheap MP3 player, have had trouble with it on several occasion and currently it is not working again. When it does work, the music quality is good that's why it gets 2 stars but I would suggest saving yourself the hassles and look elsewhere."
1,SAVE TIME AND DO NOT PURCHASE,"Aside from other inconveniences; the whole menu is in chinese/japanese, so it is hard to figure out what to do when you are stuck and far away from the little manual. Also it is very hard to turn on. It would take me about 5 minutes to turn on. Some times I just gave up and did not used it."
1,Bad item.....,Bought this item and had great hopes for it. Feels cheap and sound isn't as good as some mp3 players. I tried to return it but never got a reply from my email. If you open it forget about returning it. You can't navagate to any other folders and the screen is way to hard to read. Forget about buying I will sell mine for a dime. Realy I won't because I will use it as a flash drive to move computer files.....
3,"Great sound, quirky interface","The audio quality is excellent, but compared with the brand name products in this category the user interface seems crude. It took more than a little practice and study of the user manual before we got the hang of it.That said, given it's price point this we found this product to be a very good value."
2,2 GB MP3 Player,"This was ok for the money, decent sound quality, however it died on me after just 2 months of use. The USB drive still works (sometimes) but the built in player no longer works. I found the controls less than user friendly and difficult to use."
1,Not an mp3 player,"Easily the biggest waste of money I've ever had on the internet. The mp3 functions are very difficult to get to work, and even then you cannot organize songs. It is a total ripoff. I'm not surprised you can't return it. It might be worth $5 as a bulky USB drive"
3,Good Book for reason I purchased,"I purchased the book to help with Bible translation work. It is a reasonable resource for this type of work. As with all things there is no easy substitute for hard work. Greek Grammar is probably more difficult than most - so it is not a book that you can pick up and within a short time be able to speak and read Greek. Still requires lots of work. There is a lot of reading, memorizing and studying. You also have to have an extensive understanding of the grammar of your mother tongue."
5,Good for beginners with no Greek background,"This book is being used as a text book in one of my seminary classes. I have learned much from it. Mounce presents the language in small non-intimidating chunks. He WANTS you to learn the language and his approach is helping me to. Yes, there are aspects of Biblical Greek that are difficult, but Mounce's engaging style, exegetical insights, and cd-rom that is included, all combine to guide readers into a usable knowledge of Biblical Greek."
5,Real Basic Greek,"The author has stayed with the basics only ,thus allowing the first year student to succeed at learning the Greek language."
4,Decent introduction,"Mounce gives a very streamlined introduction to Greek, tailored specifically for the New Testament. It will get you up and reading the Greek New Testament as fast as one possibly could. This book appears to be a standard for american seminaries. My only concern is that, with this book being a standard, we will churn out pastors who read and translate Greek in the same way - the Mounce way. My intuition is that much in exegesis is a judgment call, and so my worry is that we are all getting the ""Mounce translation"" of the Greek New Testament."
5,Great Textbook,"This book is very clear cut, and easy to understand. The lessons are easy to follow. It is much better to purchase the workbook and vocabulary cards along with the textbook. It makes the lessons really come to life. The correlations Mounce draws between English grammar and Greek are helpful."
5,The best . . .,"I can not offer enough praise for this book. It transformed Greek from an archaic and difficult language to a living language in just months of semi-strenous study. Mounce makes learning Greek interesting, exciting, fun, fluent, meaningful, and even edifies your faith in Jesus Christ. I wouldn't hestitate to reccommend this book to anybody who is serious about learning the language, the pastor or the laymen."
2,NOT for Digital Photographers,"Well, now I know why this book is out ofprint...it's for film photographers'!! I'm surethat it's a well written book-just outdated."
1,Too much paper for too little concept,"I know spot metering is becoming a luxury in many consumer grade cameras and only true hobbyist would acknowledge its value in existence. However, this book simply uses too much real estate to decribe a concept that could have concisely decribed in half of the space provided. There isn't enough color examples to illustrate how to take readings in real life situations. A substantial section to describe individual camera operation is not that useful since it duplicates what should have provided from the owner manual of the camera."
4,Excelente for begginers,An excelente book for begginnners and amateur photographers who want to know the basics on exposition.
4,Spotmetering with the 5 Zone system,Spotmetering with the 5 Zone system in this book will help you take better photos. Thanks
2,Copy-Paste from another book by the same author,"[...] Actually if you have bought ""Confused photographer's guide to photographic exposure and the simplified zone system"" - you bought _MORE_ of the very same content, which is available in ""The Confused Photographer's Guide to On-Camera Spotmetering"". This book looks like a subset of the previous one, with very little additions, concerning the spotmetering. Please, don't get me wrong. It is not a completely bad book. It is acceptable as long as you haven't seen ""The Confused Photographer's Guide to Photographic Exposure and the Simplified Zone System"", where the content fits much better. Therefore simply be warned that if you have ""The Confused Photographer's Guide to Photographic Exposure and the Simplified Zone System"" you won't get almost anything new from this book. :-("
