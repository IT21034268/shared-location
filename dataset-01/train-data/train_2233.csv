1,rent it don't but it,the first bad game out of 7 that i bought. finished it the first day. low replay value. good for a rental but save your money for something else.
3,Another Advertisment for Blockbuster!,"Perhaps I demand a little too much from a video game...but this is one that you should run right out and rent but avoid actually purchasing.The graphics were fabulous. The gameplay was interesting. The storyline was a bit fuzzy. And the time to beat...three days. (Granted, I didn't unlock all of the cars but, who really cares? You get the one you need after you pass the first mission.)So basically, in three days of off and on gameplay you would have a[n expensive] coaster on your hands if you bought it. Maybe you could lend it to friends and borrow something that has a longer shelf life but they'd probably be at your door later that week screaming for you to give back their copy of Halo or Project Gotham. On the other hand, you could take my advice, play, beat, and return a pretty good game to (enter rental store of your choice here) and be done with it for a tenth of the financial cost and with all of your friendships intact."
5,"this is a solid, fun game","ok, here's the real deal on this game ... i bought an xbox recently and got six games with it ... asides from halo, this is the one I play the most. Yes, it is a little easier to beat than the majority of games out there, but it is fun as [heck]. The graphics are phenmonal, the techno soundtrack is one of the best out there, and it is just plain fun to drive super-fast and smash the hell out of everything and everyone you see. Although you can beat it somewhat quickly, it is still very fun to play to relieve stress, even after you've beaten it. A great buy. The only improvements would maybe be a multi-player option and more levels/higher difficulty."
1,This game blows chunks!,"Don't waste your time... Stupid blocky graphics. Bad physics and car movement. Overall just a shody piece of work.GTA and Driver for Playstation blow this game out of the water.The rating should be zero stars, for a zero game."
2,I want my Money Back!,"Great, Great Graphics. Hoorible Game play. Most of the cars are hard to control and flip way to easily. The fact that the missions are timed makes most of the missions seem impossible. On some you get time extentions but not enough. Because of this the game gets vey boring and frustrading. I ended up just giving up. Don't watse your money."
1,what?,As if the game ... wasn't bad enough. Can somebody please explain to me what the Yakuza is doing in Hong Kong and not in Japan???
1,Stop!,Dont buy this It is terrible. Its a game that will please people who like... Oh who am I kidding. The game is just straight up goofy as hell
1,Hype,"I rented this game from blockbuster, hoping it would be a spin off of GTA3, focusing on the yakuza gang. It isn't. Thiis game has some of the best graphics ever, but worst sound, and gameplay. The Controls are ok, but what mainly got this game a one, was that you can't play the song on the x-box harddrive with this game and there is no 2 player mode. The missions are sometimes ridiculously hard to beat, trust me. If you have already bought this game, either return it or sell it to amazon.com. I am sure... glad i rented this game before i bought it. It is all Hype."
4,Wreckless Review,"Gameplay:The Game play is sweet you got lots of freedom like crashing through the town with a 100-Ton tank or driving a small car at 143 MPH.IF you liked Driver on Playstation you will love this title.You complete a whole bunch of missions and earn alot of cars like a Tank,Van,Monster Truck,Police Truck,Nitro Car and much more!The game is a bit short but I would buy it if I were you.Graphics:The graphics is the best part of this game because it looks so real like when you crash through some glass if you look close,you can see every piece of glass fly through the air.Lighting effects are amazing like night missions the city looks like Las Vegas with all the lights.Gameplay-5Graphics-5Sound-4Overall-4.5"
4,Wreckless,"Wreckless feels like an out of control joyride through the streets of Hong Kong in a high performance rental car. You not only don't care about the damage you're dishing out, you're looking forward to the next big object you can take down just so you can see what it will look like. The outstanding graphics and lighting are the kind of features we've been waiting for on the Xbox. It looks like something fresh, something that could only be done on the most powerful machine around even though it follows the old school videogame formula of low brow fun and more low brow fun.Even with its shortcomings, lack of features and depth, Wreckless is the first in a string of upcoming Xbox titles we're about to see that delivers well developed solid gameplay to go with those outstanding Microsoft powered graphics. Xbox owners have had to suffer through a lot of old PS2 remixes and ports up to this point, but Wreckless is one of those games that will make you glad you have the system."
1,What a load of crap!!!!,Thank god i only rented this game....but it wasnt even worth the couple of $'s. the graphics are the usual japanese stuff but the gameplay is absolutely crap. i played it for 5 minutes then took it back to the store.
4,"Awesome, but could improve!","I love wreckless. I will admit that it is a little short and once you beat it it becomes one of theose games you pcik up every once in a while. My main complaint is that it dosn't have multiplayer. If it had multiplayer I would love this game soooo much. Another thing is that I wish you could drive around the city for as long as you want and when you want to take on a mission you go someplace where they tell you, like GTA3. That's about it, awesome graphics. I suggest this to anyone who likes to have fun wrecking things!"
3,"Exciting Game, Little Replay Value","This game is pretty cool, the graphics are awesome, and the characters laughable in my opinion. However, there is not much replay value in it. You might want to rent it first."
4,"Crash, jump, crash, ram, crash, plow, and crash.","The graphics and effects in this game are top notch; and may bring you to your knees if you happen to own a HDTV widescreen. The cars handle wonderfully; except they are a tad on the floaty side. It is true that every last mission is time based; but that doesnt mean you cant go back to any one of them and simply go for a joy ride around the massive city that makes up the game. If you dont have a lot of time to invest in a game, then this is a sure-fire hit. The longest you could play any one level is about 7 minutes; and that's just about perfect for those times you're waiting on someone to get ready before you can leave. I find myself popping it in for a whirl quite often while I wait for my wife to get ready. Besides, it can be quite relaxing to plunge into traffic going the wrong way on an over-crouded freeway (not to mention satisfying when the cars get torn apart and ram into one another in a chain reaction)."
2,Rent it; Don't buy it!,"This game definately has no replayability. It has been fun to play, but it is very frustrating because it is not always easy to control. For no apparent reason, the car will start going all over the road. This game does have extremely good graphics, that's about the only good thing."
4,Wild Ride!!,"I didn't like this game, but then I decided not to play it to win, it's a little too weird for that. But the graphics are enjoyable and the driving over stuff is fun. I play PGR to win, but when I'm in the mood to just drive nuts, I put this game in, press the accelerator all the way down, and I don't let up. Twenty minutes later, I've had enough and I move on to something else."
1,Rent Before you Buy!,"I rented this game and I'm glad I did so I didn't waste more money than I paid to rent it. Which in my opinion, is how much it's worth. Don't get me wrong, it had good graphics and the replays were pretty cool. But after playing GTA3 on PS2, no other driving games are fun anymore. Wreckless also had terrible gameplay, the missions that you have to do are very hard to accomplish and I don't remember their being any difficulty setting either. Also, it doesn't seem like they give you enough time to accomplish your goals and that just adds to the difficulty level. I like a good challenge, just not ""Wreckless."" No matter how good someone says a game is, my advice it to rent before you buy, so you don't end up spending [money] on something you think is worthless."
2,thay made it to be a better game than it is,"Wreckless has a good idea but the poor story and that fact that you do the same thing everytime makes it only a two day rentel (that is if you realy want to throw away your money). Wreckless also makes me remmber Blood Wake (by the way, blood wake is just like this game but ur in a boat shooting a gun). dont get me wrong they hade a good idea with the game, just make it a little more interesting and not the same thing every level"
2,Not worth the money to buy.....,"I'd recommend renting this game. I picked it up thinking it would be something like Grand Theft Auto 3, but it's nothing like it at all. You are stuck in your vehicle the whole time, and crashing into other people gets really boring after about 10 minutes. The missions are lacking, and downright easy, and the graphics aren't all that good. The cars handle really bad, and I find it awkward to steer them at higher speeds. I don't know what catagory to place this game in, I'm thinking JUNK would be a good one though. Right now, with games like this out, I'm thinking I should have stuck with the PS2."
2,Replay-ware at its finest.,"I was really excited when I saw this game preview. However, the replayware that was presented in the previews is all this game is. The actual game is not very exciting or fun to play. You can drive around and bash all of the surroundings and your indestructable car will lose a few pieces but it will still run, other than that the over all game play is cheesy.The graphics are good but it doesn't really matter when the over all game play isn't very good. Hopefully if there is a next version it will be the best of both worlds (good gameplay and great graphics). It is probably a good thing to rent this game before buying it. I wish I would have."
3,TOO SHORT!,"This game is way too short! I bought it, beat it an about an hour. What the heck I should've rented it. NO ONE NUY THIS GAME! IT ISN'T WORTH IT!"
2,"Unfortunatly, just not a good game","Please rent this game before you buy it. Luckily rented first and thanked God I didn't buy it. Tre the graphics are excellent, but the missions get so boring. After abou 20 mins. of plaing this game i got bored. It was useless to play. It would have been so much better if there was a free play mode just to look around and hang out in the city. But there isn't. After all i said, it's just not a good game. You will get bored of it pretty quickly."
2,Wreckless...yet another Bloodwake disappointment,"I got Wreckless with the antipation of owning a new fun XBox game. I, being a veteran gamer, was left sorely disappointed. After playing several missions I've come to realize that the developers of the game must think we gamers love having to do boring things over and over again. They also think we'd like to see a terrible looking instant replay of us doing it over and over again. The game frequently pummels you with below the belt hits, smacks you with cheap shots and puts a doom clock over your head just for spite. The graphics are fantastic but who cares when the gameplay is lame. They say the physics engine is accurate. I don't see it. GTA3's better than that. At least the cars don't disappear in front of you or corners throw you for a 180 everytime your near. The in game arrows will blind you and the huge map and displays all over your screen make seeing where your going a huge hassle. Bottom line, Save your money or just rent it!"
5,Who Cares?!,"This game is awesome. A lot of people rate this game poorly because there is no free roam mode. First of all, the time limits are pretty good and so you can just ignore the mission and drive around wherever u want. Another bad thing is that there is no two player mode. Hopefully there will be a sequal with free roam and multiplayer modes, or a booster disc (like DOA3 will have). Unlocking the hidden cars is fun, such as the monster truck or taxi cab. Anyway, buy this game if you want to do the sometimes fun mission or just ride around smashing things up for about 2-3 minutes per turn. Don't buy this game if you are looking forward to driving as long as you want with NO boundaries at all."
2,Misadvertised!,"Come on! From the outside of this games box, it looks to be the Xbox's answer to GTA 3. What you get when you put it in the machine is a different story. Cheesy cartoons characters and a weak plotline, backed up by monotonous game play are more than enough to offset the fabulous(and I mean FABULOUS) graphics. I've just rented it, and almost already beat it. If you want a cute cheesy game with great graphics and good driving, this game is for you. If not, just rent it, enjoy the graphics, and send it back"
2,great graphics..fun for a few days...,"this game was predicted to be one of the reasons to buy an Xbox but unfortunately that prediction was way off. The graphics are great, i can't deny that but the game is too short and repetitive. I finished my friend's game in a few days and it was good while it lasted but now that it's over i won't return to it. But a longer and larger sequel could be a great game..I'm not just saying these negative things about this Xbox game because i am a nintendo fan but this is just a bit poor..If u want good games for Xbox buy Halo/Dead or Alive 3"
2,Don't buy this game. It may be worth renting.,"The graphics are excellent. That's the only good thing I can say about it. The game play is absolutely horrible. The camera changes perspective on you at the worst possible time. The game is very frustrating because of this. The time limit to complete the levels is barely sufficient, so the seconds lost everytime the camera changes perspective cause you to lose the level. I strongly suggest you rent this game before buying it. It's only single player, so if you get tired of the missions, which you will, there's nothing left to do."
4,"""Firefly"" lights up the screen","I saw this movie on TCM and absolutely fell in love with it. I have seen most of Jeannette MacDonald's films, and this is by far the best performance - singing, acting, and even dancing - she has ever given. Alan Jones is a refreshing change from Nelson Eddy, and much more talented. The plot is full of love and intrigue (NOT slow as Maltin claims), with MacDonald as a Spanish spy during the Napoleonic wars, and Jones as the aristocratic playboy who falls for her without knowing who she really is. Songs include not only the classic ""Donkey Serenade,"" but also ""Gianina Mia,"" a passionate and beautiful love song. This film is an absolute must-see for any fan of musical operetta."
5,Janette MacDonald rules!,"Jeanette is truly one of the great stars of the silver screen--a ""triple threat--she sings, dances, and acts. In ""The Firefly"" she is free of Nelson Eddy's wooden presence and is better supported by Alan Jones who, unlike Eddy, can act. Jones' contribution is his performance of the wonderfully whimsical ""Donkey Serenade"" popularized by this movie, and more fully enjoyable when seen as performed here. You may have to be patient with the 130 minute running time but the resolution of the spy versus counter-spy plot is worth it.Too bad it is not available on DVD."
2,I Watched It for Warren,"Yes, the sole reason I sought out this movie was because it features as a villain one of my favorite (and just about forgotten) actors, Warren William. Now, with the same technique, I've come across some really good movies, like ""Cleopatra"" and ""Employees Entrance"", but ""The Firefly"" ain't one of them. And it isn't because it's an operetta--I liked ""Rosemarie"" and ""Maytime"". No, it's because it's boring and extremely unbelieveable. Eventually, I grew impatient waiting for Warren William to appear, and put the film on Fast Forward. Even then, time passed slowly. In addition, I had heard the name, ""Donkey Serenade"" before, but I found that song to be something of a loser too. SO, my advice is, watch some other Jeanette MacDonald movie, not this one."
2,Well...,"I bought two of these little guys for the kids. One works, the other needs to be sent back for repair after 2 months. The pictures are surprisingly nice for a camera this size. They are not meant to be durable and you get what you pay for. Overall, generally happy, but a little bummed to send one for repair."
4,Back To The Cross,"I really enjoyed this title by Watchman Nee.Back To The Cross reminds us we have to know what happened and recognize it's significance to our present-day lives as Christians.Much like his other works,this title provokes thought and entices a reader to read the WORD -that is,the BIBLE-"
4,Nice bracelet,"This is a nice bracelet. It's definitely unique, but it looks alot more different than in the picture. The picture makes it look more full, whereas when you receive the it, you notice that the amethyst beads are not woven all around the bracelet...more like branches on a tree. You have ""branches"" with the amethyst beads attached to it. Overall, I like the product."
2,You get what you pay for,"It is a super cheap filter in comparison to Sony's original filters, but there is a damn good reason for that. My DSLR will not focus with this filter and when I manually focus, the pictures still look blurry. Bad product, that's all"
5,All That Jazz,"When I first heard about Chicago and every single rave review I was sure that it was overrated, but sure enough, it most definitely WAS ""All That Jazz""I liked every song on this album with the exception of the rap version of Cell Block Tango. It is just a bad intruder in an otherwise incredible collection. The best song on the album though is the NON-rap version of Cell Block Tango. All That Jazz and I Can't Do It Alone are also very good. If you haven't bought the album, it's worth every red cent."
5,And All That Jazz...,"This CD is a MUST HAVE for all Chicago fans! Who knew that Richard Gere (Billy Flynn) could sing? The only problem that I found with the movie is that they changed one premise. Mary Sunshine, in the original is supposed to be a male and I was a little disappointed but hey! They still pulled it off spectacularly. All That Jazz is a song that will play in your head over and over...as well as Cell Block Tango. I had seen this on stage over the summer and was ecstatic that they were making a movie version. All I Care About is great as well as Razzle Dazzle - which is my fave song - and...oh, just get the cd and you'll know what I mean! :-)"
4,"Great movie, but...","Chicago was an excellent movie. I absolutely loved it and I recommend that everybody should see it. However, if you're looking for the best Chicago soundtrack, I would go with the revival cast. Then you get the songs that didn't make it into the film like ""Class"" or ""I Know a Girl"". If you want all of the good songs of Chicago, you should go with the revival cast...But go buy Chicago on DVD, VHS, and any other form it comes in."
5,one word......... AWESOME,"this cd is simply a master piece. i am 17 and i cant put it down, the lyrics are great, the music is awesome and the acotrs did a great job of doing these songs. Listening to this cd is enough to make any person get up and dance. It is just awesome, and no words can describe it so get the cd and hear it for yourself!"
4,An honest offering for an Awesome God,"Great job, Cary and Kerry. I absolutley love it! This album expresses true honest expressions of love, frustration, worship, and awe to our loving, almighty God. Compare Kerry's voice to any ""greats"" in the music business: Christy Nockels (Watermark), Martina McBride, Faith Hill, Sandy Patti ... Along with Cary's songwriting, instrumental ability, and vocals, this couple will lead us into the throneroom of heaven for many years to come. I wish you two the best in life, love, and ministry. God's grace to you all..."
2,Grizzly live center,"This product came to me in a completely unworkable condition. When I spun it on a lathe it wobbled so bad that it was completely unusable. The only reason I gave it two stars was because when I took the time to call Grizzly and tell them about it, they were very helpful and immediately sent me a new one at their cost. The new one is better although it does not run perfectly true. I guess it will do for most work. My recommendation: spend a little more money and buy from companies other than Grizzly or Delta."
1,Don't shop from this company,Co-Mo Sketch Pad by Bee Paper Co.- 9x12 Inch PadI ordered 2 sketch pads over a month ago and still haven't recieved them! I haven't had any communication from the company either. They are unresponsive to email. Use the gas and go buy it at the store.
3,that is sound good,"although this book have long publish, it provide a good concept for decision making."
2,MY FACE!,"The mask made my face hurt. It wasn't cool. It had a dent in it which made it fit weirdly on my face and, eventually, before the night was done (Halloween) my face hurt real bad!"
5,Great Book!,"This book is a great book! It is about a woman who finding herself in a sleazy situation with a very handsome man, is forced to marry him! Watch the sparks fly as the two face off and the new bride run awayto fins out that running away adn ehr new husband was not at all what she expected. THis is a GREAT BOOK! Glenda Sanders is a wonderful author!"
2,The Score: Rereleased,"Too many groups in our time have had one hit album and still dare to come out with a greatest hits collection years later. The Fugees are no different. This so called 'hits' album is nothing but the highlights of their 1996 sophmore release The Score. From Killing Me Softly to No Woman, No Cry, nothing in this bunch is new and/or exciting. With the exception of a few edits, weak remixes and a couple of other ""hits"" (one not even from the Fugees, but just Lauryn Hill), there is virtually no reason to purchase this cd if you already own The Score. This record only proves that The Fugees are has beens and with this few hits, maybe they never were."
5,Swollen again brings it home,"Again Cananda's most renound rap band have done it again. Introducing a new breed of hip-hop to the world and guess what?...it works. Compiled of some old tracks that have been made up to date and a few new tracks that still breathe of the same swollen members that we all know form the first and second album. While Stepin thru uses moko only's vocals to create a calm and laid back effect,i'm alive is a more grittier track and there is also the more serious side on a long way down using Sarah Maclaglan's vocals as the harmony in the song. This is a must buy for any Swollen members fans and also for anyone who likes hip-hop and rap. Believe me u will like!"
2,Please Be Warned!,"This release is without a doubt swollen member's worst album yet.Please Be Warned, DO NOT buy this Cd if you like swollen members.Youo will only be dissapointed by so-so lyrics and beats that sound like old songs chopped up and switched around to create something with less rythym than the original. YOu might like this Cd if your into sell-outs and pop-cored hip-hop.BE WARNED!"
1,please skip,"Monsters in the closet is by far their worst album ever. It sounds like they took their old tracks, put them in a blender, and put them back together without the instructions. Please skip this album, but if you must have swollen members, which I think is a bad idea entirely, pick up balance or bad dreams."
4,Great album but songs not same as LP,"I can highly recommend this CD because the songs are all great. But I was disappointed that it included only ONE song from the original Midnight in Moscow LP. After much research, I found another English import CD that has seven of the original eleven songs from the Midnight LP, ""Back at the Start"". I haven't ordered it yet but hope it is close to the LP version."
5,Wonderful Wimsey!,Oh the joys of watching Wimsey and Bunter .... every bit as good as the Nine Tailors. Absolutely wonderful fun and a peek at the domestic history of the upper class of England.
1,Five Red herrings Lord Peter Wimsey,I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the DVD - it was a copy of a copy of a copy - grainy and in black and white. I wouldn't have cared except I played the part of Gilda in the series and wanted my grand children to see what their granny looked like at 25 years! The series I might add was made up in Scotland in full colour. I will nver buy from Amazon again.
5,Outstanding Dorothy Sayers mystery.,Lord Peter Wimsey and his faithful manservant Bunter travel to Scotland for a holiday. On a fishing outing they discover a dead artist who appears to have fallen to his death. Lord Peter suspects foul play and helps the local police sort through clues in a baffling case. The attention to detail in this fine mystery is superb as is the acting. Ian Carmichael is the perfect choice to play Lord Peter. In the DVD version we have a chance to listen to him discuss the making of the Lord Peter mysteries as part of the extra features offered to the viewer.
2,Not too impressed..,Bought this for my grandson and have had a heck of a time keeping the swinging doors from falling off the stands. I have taped them on and they still come off. Not too imppressed with how it is holding up.
4,Caterpillar/Butterfly is the BEST,"This is part 8 in a wonderful series. My daughter adores the Caterpillar song, and asks for it numerous times through the day--even doing the signs as though she is singing to herself. The rest of the DVD is fun and interesting and includes a host of different signs that are helpful and educational. For some reason the Caterpillar song is by far the one that strikes the best chord with my 21-month old, though. ""When the Ants/bugs Come Marching In"" is also fun. I can't recommend the series enough--and this particular DVD is top-rated because of the final segment in my opinion, along with the ABC's and counting to 10 (which are both after the final credits, and make the DVD worthy of purchase IMHO)."
5,We love signing time,"My daughter doesnt talk at 3yrs. Speech delay from other problems, these videos have been wonderful to help us cummicate. We have 10 or so."
2,Does not track,I bought this based on good reviews I read. This item is packaged so you can't tell what the texture is like even if in the store. But once home and opened I found the surface doesn't read well with any of the variety of laser mice that I have. This mouse pad skips or just doesn't respond at all. I found the the functionality of this mouse pad to be so frustrating that I gave up and just use a sheet of notebook paper instead which is unfortunate because the photo on the pad is so beautiful and the notebook paper in contrast looks like crap. I think the other reviewers must be grading the picture alone.
3,Not as described,"I was looking for a hard plastic surface mouse pad, as the fabric ones tend to look dirty and peel after a while. This one said it was a hard surface mouse pad, so I bought it. It's just one of the same old fabric ones you can buy anywhere, and yes, it already looks filthy, and yes, the fabric is peeling off the rubber mat. At least it's a pretty picture."
4,"good mousepad, just DON'T BUY from HANDSTANDS","The actual mousepad that this ad shows is a great mousepad. BUT this is NOT what I received from the company HANDSTANDS. this is supposed to be a fast trak mousepad with the hard cover that is plastic. this is how it was described in the description of the product, and what I wanted. i paid and waited over a week, and what i got was a cheap cloth 1/4"" thick mousepad, very upset. i ordered it for my brother, i have this exact mousepad from best buy and it works great, it has a hard coating. they did a bait and switch and now i'm left with an opened mousepad -by my brother who didn't know any better- that is cloth and useless for his new optical mouse i bought it for. they won't return my emails or ship the correct product. beware of this company."
1,Misleading Search Results,"This may or may not be a good mouse pad. I haven't tried it yet. What infuriates me is that I searched Amazon for a ""hard surface mouse pad"" and this one was included in the results. The cryptic description did not include specifications like hard/soft surface and I bought it because the search results implied that it was what I wanted. However, it is not a hard surface pad. I am really annoyed with Amazon. This experience will make me very wary of purchasing from Amazon again."
1,Sad turn for a great band,"This is a sad, sad album. The Derailers, one of the world's great honkytonk bands, get buried under slick Nashville production and hackwork songwriting. When the sessioneers outnumber the bandmembers, you know something's wrong, especially when your producer hires an extra drummer, an extra bassist, four extra guitarists and five extra harmony singers to handle positions the band itself is quite capable of doing themselves, and better than these so-called pros. Singer Tony Villanueva, one of the best in the business, sounds bored and disengaged from the material, and with complete (edited) like ""I Love Me Some Elvis"" on the docket, I don't blame him. His partner Brian Hofeldt, an excellent harmony singer and a bleeping GREAT guitarist, might as well not even be here, and given the audio evidence, he may not be.This record takes one of the most distinctive bands in country music and turns them into just another piece of product. Genuine? Not even close."
1,Genuinely disappointing,"Sadly, another stinker from a once great band. I was hoping their previous two releases were anomolies--a bit of failed experimentation in a new pop-influenced sound--but, alas, this one is even worse. Gone is the fresh, tight Bakersfield sound and first-rate song writing. It is way too overproduced. Songs are forgettable and [average]. The once great Derailers have become another bland Nashville country act. I agree totally with Micheal Toland's review above. If you are fan of the Jackpot, Reverb Deluxe, Live Tracks Derailers, you will be genuinely disappointed with Genuine."
5,"Fab Four From Austin ""Genuine""ly Deliver","The talent, diversity, and dedication of this Texas foursome really shines through on this one. From the catchy title tune to the bluegrass style gospel final track, ""Genuine"" has something for everyone. The Bakersfield sound that fans of the Derailers have come to love is abundantly present, but so too is a diverse combination of British Invasion, soulful country-blues, and plain good fun. The vocal (and songwriting!) talents of frontmen Tony Villanueva and Brian Hofeldt grow stronger with each new album. Including bassist Ed Adkins, drummer Scott Matthews, and a bevy of outstanding studio musicians, these gentlemen blend all 12 wonderful tracks together seamlessly. In short, the Derailers are the ""Genu-ine"" deal, both on this album, and in person."
1,Wrong Edition Sold to me=No book for class :(,"I purchased this book in January and received probably the very first edition since its published date was 1996. I was supposed to receive the 3rd edition!!! Now I can't sell it back, so I'm stuck with a book that I never used because it wasn't the right edition needed for the class, and I'm out $30. Thanks, stupid seller!"
5,cool toy that is really cool,if u were to buy a toy i would buy this one it is really cool but it does not come with the helper that it shows it comes with a bird helper if u have the megaman aniversery collection game then u will know who i am talking about i think that u will really like it it even comes with a poster and a thing that u can shoot out of the gun (not shown in the picture) u will really like it
2,long winded,"I think everyone should be cool on this review, we watched the film and found it just ok. If someone doesnt like the film they have the right to voice it here! It sounds like the last reviewr is someone involved in the film and hyping it too much ! Lets be real people dont go overboard prasing your film, let the viewers decide. It had some good moments with seymore, but i could watch him clip his nails! was a 2 for one rental in my book!"
1,tring to be a gay film noir,"I think what we have here is a gay film noir! One of the first of its kind.the homosexual tension between ross and marty is explosive!And the film is full of S&M; beatings and gay under tones, between the blantently gay detective duo and the glue sniffing hitman with the fred astaire shoes!! Ross and marty spend all ther time together, one desperatly wanting a differnt lifestyle, and doing anything to change it. as a openly gay man i liked where it could have went! BRAVO for tryiing boys!"
5,Brilliant,"I have owned this book for a a number of years and have made spectacular dinners to rave reviews. I love the way Nicole organizes entire meals. I have never made an exact copy of one of her party dinners but I get so much inspiration from her suggestions. I've made the tenderloin roast, the pork loin with fig sauce, the tangerine dressing (amazing) with the Christmas salad, and last Christmas made the polenta with wild mushrooms.Last week I noticed that the book had (gasp) disappeared from my kitchen. I looked and looked, and have decided that I just need to get another copy instead of stressing out about it. Which is why I'm on amazon tonight.I have a couple dozen cookbooks and several years of Cooking Light, Cooks illustrated, and Simple Food. This is my favorite. Thanks, Nicole."
5,great ring for the price!,I was very pleased with this purchase. The ring was well made and very pretty.
5,Saw it on OPRAH!,I was just finishing my copy of this book when I saw the authors were quoted on Oprah's show on June 26. I think the authors have lots of great ideas and they obviously have first hand experience. And to see the book and writers quoted on Oprah gave more emphasis to their points. I would recommend this book to anyone who has started or is even remotely thinking about starting an at-home business.
2,Not functional for my lathe.,"Figured I would go ahead and take a gamble on this cheap face plate thinking my odds were good with the brand name Grizzle on it. Sadly I lost out. The biggest design flaw is that it is only 5/8"" thick (which is not noted in the product description). This means that once the face plate is fully threaded onto the arbor it is exposed by 3/8"" past the face (on my 1"" long arbor). Another problem is that the threads only extend for roughly 5/16"" in from the face (also not mentioned in the product description). Lastly, none of the edges were sanded down after milling.I only gave this 2 stars because it may possibly work great on a mini lathe or some other lathe, however if that is the case it needs to be mentioned in the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!"
2,Beware of corruption,"This product worked well for about 12 months. Unfortunately something went wrong behind the scenes and the card became corrupted. I had to toss the card and lost the pictures I had just taken (at a wedding, of course). If reliability is important, go for Transcend. If you need a cheaper card that will last a few months and don't have heavy stuff riding on it's performance, this may be just the thing."
3,c'mon.. how frustrating,What are you doing Logitech?? You produce a pretty nice wireless controller for XBOX but not if you like XBOX LIVE. You even cautiously hide the length of the cord by not displaying a picture. You EVEN make it worse by not making the cord breakaway so I can get an extender for it so NOW I have to sit closer to my TV than I did with the wired controller. THIS STINKS! At least it's late enough I can't take it back tonight... I get to sleep on the question of whether to throw even MORE money your way to purchase a now necessary wireless headset.. If I do decide to go that way I only hope it doesn't interfere with my wireless network since you had the brilliant notion of putting it on the 2.4 Ghz freq.
2,Just horrible,"I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up."
2,"Alright, but not worth the $$","I just got this controller hoping to get a complete wireless setup with the headset and such, but no longer. I got to hold it at 'best buy', and it seemed to feel fine with a little getting used to, but I never actually got to play with it. I was quite melancholy after I started playing halo2 @ home, for the a,x,y,b buttons would not respond with a simple push. They must be pressed quite hard for them to respond, which really messes up my gaming experience. Other than that, the D-pad is quite unfixed, but the feel is comme-ci-comme-ca. I'm returning this for a halo 2 headset."
5,completely fantastic,"this game is great, including the fact that you can punch people in the face and then slam them on the ground, this game has no boundries!"
1,A waste of my time,"I'm going to be very terse with my review of this game. IT SUCKS!! Midway needs to find a new field, and I'm not playing find a new field. Maybe this could make me and others happy who dislike this item and used their good money for something that is more of use."
4,the new blitz rules!!!,this game is so much better than the n-64 version. you will love it from the second you start. It isn't the BEST game but it is the gameplay that makes it look cool.
3,not to good,I dont think this game is very cool. I mean the graphics that the gamecube can hold i would think that this game would have better graphics than what it has. My veiw is I dont like it.
5,Good primer for eastern PA history,"This book is one of a series of books on historic American communities and because it covers Pennsylvania, all the key elements of the struggle for Independence, strife of the Civil War and much more are covered here. Most interesting are the aspects of the so-called ""Pennsylvania Dutch"" folklife which runs through this book like a unifying thread. This author knows what he's talking about. Also see, ""Made in York: A Survey of the Agricultural and Industrial Heritage of York County, PA.,"" and the must-read, ""The Grand Review: The Civil War Continues to Shape America."" I also like the book, ""Pennsylvania Heritage: Diversity in Art, Dance, Food, Music and Customs"" with history by Sheets and lavish color photographs by Blair Seitz."
4,a little planning goes a long way....,"'Revenge is sweet, but the taste of cold revenge lingers longer'. What a book! I never thought there were that many ways to destroy your enemies, often for so little outlay. The book has many easy to follow recipes for disastrous results towards the object of your affliction, often with very little preperation. Varying from simple little attention seekers to landing your victim in jail, this book covers a broad spectrum of revengology. If there are people in this world who get on your nerves, then this is the book for you."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is full of mundane gags that would be almost impossible to pull off against an enemy. Anyone with half an imagination could come up with something better. Yes, I fell for the much overrated review of the publisher and wasted my money. Don't waste yours!!"
4,Be careful,Not to actually partake in these situations. But awesome to think about screwing others who have wronged you and when you are unable to turn the other cheek.
1,this is not cologne!,"there is a difference between ""eau de toilette"" and ""cologne"" It makes me furious when I search for ""cologne"" and I get this!"
5,stabila best levels made,"best level ive ever used in 18 years. definately beats the old plumb bob plumbing walls also does very nice job on ridge poles and gable trusses. i definately wont be working with out this level. very durable,alittle heavy, nice tool thank goodness someone building tools for the contractors not this toy store junk."
4,Not quite as good as a Plumb-It,"I generally love Stabilia levels, and I own 5 of them, but for a plate level, this one cannot compete with my Plumb-It PIX 5.0. Conceptually they're similar, with the exception that the Plumb-It reduces to about a third of its length which means that my PIX 5.0 can go from 5 feet to almost 14 feet. Because it can shrink down smaller, I can use it to plumb 6'8"" doors and the bed of my truck is only 6 feet deep, so the Plumb-It can fit in there while the Stabilia can't. At the same time, the Plumb-It it can extend almost 2' longer. The extra length is really helpful when you need to do some horizontal leveling like setting cabinets. I also like that the Plumb-It is super durable (it's survived a ton of jobsite abuse), super accurate, and that Plumb-It sells replacement parts for affordable prices in the event of a disaster."
4,"It is, what it is, and it's worth every dime.","This mower is a surprise. I've used it to reclaim field land, which involved cutting waist high thick stemmed weeds. I did it with the deck set at it's highest and in second gear, but the way it worked, I feel I could have dropped the deck to 3"" and went to third gear without much argument. It's a working little tractor, and there are few things it doesn't like. You can hog your way through weeds do high you can't see out while your cutting, or a manicured lawn, it'll gladly do either without much trouble.The only task I've ever asked of it that it didn't take to readily was pulling. If the trailer is loaded the least bit light on the tongue, even two hundred pounds will cause traction problems. It *could* do with a slightly larger fuel tank, but beyond that, I can't see any improvements."
1,Don't ship something this large,"I ordered this mower through Amazon and almost as soon as the order was complete the problems began. First the actual seller would not provide any tracking information. Next when the mover actually arrived in my area the freight company had to make several attempts to deliver and then sent a semi even though I told them that a smaller truck was required to get into my driveway. I ended up helping the driver push the crate on a pallet jack the several hundred yards from the street. After unpacking the mover and doing the partial assembly I started mowing. The mower lasted about an hour before the engine let go. I contacted the seller and started the procedure to get a refund. So far they have refused to refund the purchase price until they get the mower back but have not yet managed to get it out of my yard. It has now been a month that it is sitting out there in the yard. Bottom line, think twice before having something this large shipped from Amazon."
2,Here's the problem,"The quality is fine. However, the cable has a tight coil to it which makes it easy to coil up (it does it by itself), but hard to uncoil. You can easily scratch your bike wrestling with it trying to get it stretched out. I wish I had gotten a rubberized chain lock."
2,Bracket,"The Bracket that comes with this item breaks as soon as you attach the lock,,,Its made of thin plastic and cannot support the weight of the lock."
2,"Good Magazine, bad service","I liked this magazine so much that I would renew for the longest term possible. Last time I did this in about 6 months I got a notice that my subscription was running out. So I renewed again for, I believe one year. I then started getting the magazine both at my work and at my house. After about 3 months both mailings stopped. I figure I paid for about 2 years of magazines and got 8 months worth.I don't have time to keep track of my subscriptions and write to the magazine to straighten things out. So I won't subscribe again. I will look up online the recent articles and if there is a good one I will go to Barnes and Noble and read it while standing at the magazine rack."
1,Terrible service,"Their customer service is incredibly bad. Each time I try to activate my account, I get conflicting messages - need to activate on one page, already activated on another, e-mail unrecognized on a third. I've called for help 3 times with no success. Lastly have been told to wait a week."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"I subscribed to this magazine and did not receive any issues. When I called customer service I was told that three magazines were sent. They told me they were having problems with some new orders. I asked to cancel my subscription and receive a full refund. They said I already received three issues, which I had not received. They offered a partial refund and charged me full retail price for the three missing issues. This company is based in England. There are much better magazines published in USA. Avoid dealing with this company."
4,A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Geral R. Ford,"Having lived through the turbolent sixties and the Watergate era, I was able to more fully appreciate what a great leader Gerald Ford was. He was not a flashy person, but he was steady and calm. He restored a sense of calmness and reliability to a hurting nation."
5,Ford's Autoobiography,I have read many a Presidential biography and was surprised and captivated by Ford's clear writing style and prose. Dare I say this ranks among the best and offers a fresh look at a difficult chapter of our American past through the eyes of somone at the center of the storm.
1,This product is NOT AS DESCRIBED.,"This is probably a fine RP-SMA-M to RP-SMA-F extension cable, but it is NOT a RP-SMA to SMA ADAPTER cable as titled and described.The shipped product (which is CORRECTLY identified on its manufacturer packaging as an RP-SMA to RP-SMA cable) has a RP-SMA Female (inner thread, female center conductor) on one end and an RP-SMA Male (outer thread, male center pin) connector.The packaging carries the same manufacturer part number (RPSMA10MF) as the Amazon page."
1,Fuggetaboutit,"My desktop PC has a built in wireless card with antenna. I purchased this ten foot antenna extension in an effort to improve reception by moving the antenna closer to my wireless router in another part of the house. It did not improve the connection; in fact it reduced the reception signal by 50%. So, if you think this cable will help, fuggetaboutit!!!"
5,For SAAB 9-5 SE 2001,"worked fine on my 2001 Saab 9-5 SE. both original links had all bushings damaged. ""Moogs"" worked fine, got rid of vibration and bad traction in front-end."
4,"Can you count, suckas?","I never watched the movie until I played the game. Kind of backwards, I know, but the game is just so much fun. The graphics aren't anything really special, but the lack of graphical power is more than made up by sheer fun. The framerate is excellent, even when you have like 20-25 guys fighting, throwing stuff, and running around on screen all at once. The game is well-paced, and by the third level, you will know all the moves and it will feel like you are one bad mother!Play this game, it is worth the $50 because a lot of extras are included as well. Plus, you can play through the entire story with 2 people! Twice the fun! If you liked Shaolin Monks or Bouncer, play this game. The Warriors is what Shaolin Monks and Bouncer should have been."
2,Very dissapointing,"The worker at GameStop recommended this game over Sopranos and Transformers(I haven't played either). This game is a mix of very easy and non-engaging. The entire game you are given instruction after instruction about 5 seconds apart. It feels as though the game keeps telling you, ""run forward"", ""follow Warchief"" over and over. The game for me became boring after about 20 minutes. I was anticipating some further action to take place, but never got to it."
2,Opinions differ but I didn't like it,"I think the whole idea of The Warriors with vests and funny afros, bandanas, baseball uniforms... is just silly. Warlord looks like one of those guys who throws a towel over his head because he's gonna do yard work. Add all this to an imaginary world of gangsters who don't use guns and you have a very silly beatem up game. I have trouble distinguishing the difference between this and State of Emergency.When in cooperative mode, the game play splits into two screens and everything gets a lot smaller. The camera gets confusing and the game looses any atmosphere it's supposed to have. In the end I just remember running around in circles fetching for items in these mini like city portions. I just didn't like it, if you want a violent atmospheric game, I recommend Manhunt also from Rockstar games. A game I personally thought was underrated."
1,that game was broken,"i cant believe it out of all the things ive orded and this was the only item by far that didnt work. It was a gift and the child was very sad and upset. they need better processing for the used items. Not only that i recieve everything fast except my return envelope for the game, for the refund."
5,Great Beat-Em Up Game!,"The Warriors is action packed all the way through.You play as a gang called The Warriors,of course.Then,you take on rival gangs and get to kick their asses.You can also loot stores,smash up the neighborhood,steal car radios,mug people and steal their money...the game is awesome.You can pick up differnt items and use them as weapons too.Theres is just so much you can do in this game.When your not playing through story mode,if you choose to,you can also free roam and do little things here and there.I would highly recommend this game.I just found out that this was based off of a movie.I didin't even know a film like this even existed,I just thought it was a video game that Rockstar made.Now that I know that this is a film,I have GOT to check it out.Five Stars!"
4,Good game and good movie.,I would like to see more games like this in the future.This game ranks high on my list when it comes to replay.Hope to see another Warriors game on either Xbox 360 or PS3 or any future game console.This game is worth the money.
4,Warriors,The movie was great. I am looking forward to the game when it comes out. Hope it will be on xbox as well. Looking at the game Red Dead Revoler. I know rockstar will not let us down.
1,Rockstar is a joke,"I sincerely believe that Rockstar Games is quite possibly the cheapest video game company in the industry today.Example:-The Junkyard where you rescue Lance Vance in GTA: Vice City is 99% the same thing as a level in Manhunt.-Dialogue in The Warriors was lifted from Manhunt, but with different voices.The game itself is, basically, a rockstar game. Boring controls, mediocre gameplay, decent voice-acting, which again is repetitive (when tagging the Destroyers turf one of your fello gang members spits the same line about 6 or 7 times.)Thus far, Rockstar games is 1 for, well, i don't know how many they've made, but Manhunt is their only good game."
1,ITS A GOOD GAME FOR ADULTS,"I must say for a Kid this is not a game for them. Like all rockstar games there for the Adults. Its got very bad language in it. Everything from a person trying to Rape a girl and all that. I must say all and all this game sucks. I was a fan of the Movie and rented this game. I got it played the tutorial and then it got down to the game. It was all and all Bad with Play bad the camera gets lost at times with you losing your player, then you have the Bad moral behind the game. F-word used to much. Sex offered to much. This day and age has brought out the worste in people. I had Pacman growing up he ate dots and ghosts now the kids are playing games where they go out and steal and kill people gives a great understanding to LIFE.---------------------DONT BUY-------------------------------------------------BAD LANGUAGE, BAD BEHAVIOR, YOU NAME ITS GOT -------"
4,The Bee's Knees,"Picked this up Friday, and haven't stopped since... Addictive. Well done, Rockstar.The controls takes a bit of getting use to, but you get use to it fast.Great game, but NOT FOR CHILDREN."
5,It's a miracle!,"I never taught i'd find A game better than GTA but I have, it's the happiest day of my life, Ithink i'm gonna cry."
2,oatmeal,"The product is very good. Best oatmeal around. This vendor is NOT. I've tried to get a response from them about the shipping and they have ignored 4 attempts. I paid for expedited shipping, which was more than the oatmeal, or the same and it arrived about 10-14 days later. They shipped it ground and took my money for 2 day shipping. All I wanted was the difference of ground/2nd day reimbursed to my account. I'll go to Ireland before I order from them again."
2,What a Disappointment,"I love ghost stories, and I love cafes. I thought this book would be the perfect marriage of those two subjects, but I was wrong. The writing was too complicated. I found myself as frustrated with the author as Henry was with Wanda. There were several times when details were left out and then referenced later. I also got very tired of the author's one-word paragraphs: that technique was done to death. What bothered me the most was the author's philosophy that ANYONE can get into Heaven. I hate to think of Saddam and Osama getting in......"
2,Didn't fix my problem,Unknown if the trigger was defective or something else was wrong with my stapler but it didn't fix my stapler so I ended up buying a new one and will return this.
1,Waste of money,"I'm a mature woman who still gets an occasional pimple. I don't want a harsh acne cream, so I thought I would try these. I've used the Olay and even Walmart brand of facial cleansing cloths and love them. All you do is wet them and they lather very well. I thought these would be similar, but I was mistaken. These ""cloths"" feel like actual fabric (polyester?) and are useless. They don't lather and my face didn't feel clean after using them. I wasted my money on these and will have to find someone who wants them, or I might just have to end up throwing them away."
1,worst skincare product out on the market.,First off i didn't even know how these things worked when i used them it looks like the wet-nap u get at applebees smell is terrible does not work at all way too expensive better off with clearisil pads u get double the pads half the price and u don't have to wet ur face to remove dirt and grim.
3,Not quite what I expected...,"I've been using Neutrogena face washes for years, but have always been in liquid form and liked them. Thought these cleansing cloths looked interesting so I'm giving them a try. The cloths come dry. You're suppose to wet your face and the cloth before using. The cloth is not necessarily that soft and will not lather up very much. The 'rough' side doesn't seem very rough at first take, but you've got to be careful not to use too much force scrubbing your face or else it'll get irritated. When rinsing face, it doesn't feel like the cleanser is all rinsed out because my face doesn't have that squeaky clean feeling to it which some people may say that's not a bad thing. While it hasn't hurt my face, the experience of the cloths is just not what I thought it was going to be. I will still use up my supply of them though."
3,Works great but WalMart is much cheaper,These face clothes are wonderful for short trip when you do not want to pack your liquid facial cleaner but they sell at WlamArt for a few dollars less & no shipping charges.
4,Effective at controlling acne.,"I used this product a lot when I was in high school. It was very effective and controlling acne. Not 100% but good enough. They are slightly harsh, especially at first but nothing you can't get used to when used regularly. It's better that they make one side of the washcloth slightly rough so you can choose how much pressure to use for your personal preference. Some need more exfoliation than others. I gave it 4 stars because now in adulthood (Unfortunately still have acne problems), I have discovered that Retin-A (another product from Neutrogena, albeit prescription) + Clindamycin Phosphate antibiotic lotion everyday has been the most effective acne treatment for me to date. Still, if you are not willing to go the prescription route for whatever reason these washcloths are a great product to exfoliate daily with and maintain breakouts."
5,Good quality and well made,"I wasn't sure what to expect after reading previous less than glowing reviews on the newer ""Made in China"" Spode. The item I received was solid and well made. Even with closer scrutiny and inspection the glazing was smooth. The patterns are centered, clear and crisp. The cover fitted perfectly to the dish. There does not appear to be ""rough spots"" or unglazed surfaces anywhere. In my opinion, this item is was not inferior in any way to the other pieces of Spode that I currently own that are ""Made in England"". In addition to that, the prices that Amazon offers here are amazing! I would highly recommend this item to anyone!"
2,Deceiving stroller,"I bought this stroller for my 8 month old daughter for two reasons, price and appearance. I liked how compact and light it was when folded. However after using it at home, I soon discovered how difficult it was to push and steer and turn. Nothing was smooth about it and it required such effort in pushing my daughter. Also, I couldn't imagine her getting any bigger and sitting comfortably in the seat, it wasnt very deep and she appeared to be uncomfortable sitting in it. I ended up getting rid of it and purchased a PegPerego which I love."
1,Terrible Stroller,Well the clasp just took out a piece of my flesh when I was opening it for son. When combined with the other complaints from other customers I really would not recommend this product.
2,very frustrating,I bought this stroller because I have the Quatro stroller system and was looking for something smaller for quick trips to the mall and just around. I also wanted to take this stroller to Florida for our famliy vacation. Well I ended up bringing my big stroller. My son just doesn't seem comfortable in this stroler he is always slouching to the side and he's 14 months old. The tray is way to high so he can't really use it and the sun shade is ridiculous that's the main reason I didn't bring it to sunny florida. It is very hard to move around also I find myself getting very frustrated at it. The positions of the seat are way off - They are like kindof sitting up and kindof laying down. I was really excited about this stroller and actually told 3 other people to buy it which they did and now we all feel we wasted our money even if it was just $40.
3,Love this stroller but hate some things about it!,"I love the fact that it is so light weight and easy to push around but here are the things I don't like about it: The seat is to narrow, the straps are to hard to snap in and out (plus the middle strap is the only thing that keeps her from falling out of it), and the tray is to high (It should be lower like in my big stroller). I really don't think I would buy another one."
1,Hate it!! Dropping off at goodwill!! Hope someone else likes it better!,"I bought this stroller because it looked to have everything I wanted (cup holder, basket, recline) in a ""affordable"" lightweight stroller. The only thing good about this stoller is the basket and the cup holders! This stroller is very hard to push because the front wheels spin into opposite directions. The back of the seat is so hard my daughter will not sit in it for long. The buckle is very hard to push together and will pinch you (taking skin with it) if you are not careful!I am going to purchase another stoller to replace this one. Maybe you do get what you pay for?"
1,Horrible and Big Waste of Money!,"Do not bother wasting money on this item; just add more and buy more expensive one. Yes this thing is light and has all these trays, BUT SO DO THE OTHER STROLLERS!!! My son's feet always slide off the foot bar and caused him an injury, wheels never spin smoothly - I have to fight to push it all the time! In addition, my son always almost slides out of it and most of the time he has to ride in a very uncomfortable position because no matter how many times I pull him up, he slides down within minutes. Also, I had my fingers pinched by the clips - I think others had the same problem. It is a terrible product - just add $20 and get a better one."
2,where is the straps for the shoulders?,"We are grandparents bought the baby trend trendlite Model 1204 for price and weight. Love the basket underneath, bag at the back, sunshade. Very concerned about the safety of having only a safety strape around the child's waist. I tried to rig up a 5-point harness. Really puzzled why it does not have straps for the child's shoulders. My grand daughter is constantly leaning forward, looking at her feet or pulling her shoulders forward. Everytime she does this, I could see the stroller rolling right on over with her in it if no one was hanging on to the handles. Very cautious, not sure I will risk her getting hurt in it."
5,Wonderful stroller!,"I love this stroller. I have 3 kids so I have purchased a lot of strollers at almost every price point and this $40 stroller is my favorite. My 2 year daughter loves it and loves the tray. It is a compact stroller that is perfect for quick outtings and even at a day at Disneyland. I love that it has two cup holders on top and a cup holder on the kid's tray, perfect for her sippy cup. It is compact so the basket will not hold a whole lot but I dislike bulky strollers so it is perfect for me. It was also super simple to put together. Another plus is that the handles is high so my husband who is 6 foot does not have to hunch over to push it. I really loved my purchase."
2,do not recommend,"I purchased this stroller for my 14 month old son, because I was looking for a lightweight stroller with a tray (which is impossible to find) and a storage basket. I am now in the process of looking for a new stroller. The seat depth is too short, the harness is sooo hard to get unbuckled, the tray is too high, and most of all it is impossible to manuever. I would not recommend this stroller to anyone."
1,don't buy this stroller,"I bought this stroller as a cheap inexpensive light weight stroller to use in a pinch. However, the strap buttons are way to tight and the stroller is very hard to collapse. I have to spend a lot of time messing with it, just to get it open. I only use my graco from now on, it's bigger, but it's much easier to use."
2,Not as good as it seems...,"This stroller seems to have everything, but once I actually used it, I was very disappointed. The seat is too small (in depth) for my 13 month old daughter-I felt like she was going to fall out. The tray is positioned too high-I was afraid she'd hit her chin if we went over a bump or something. Finally, the back cushion isn't really a cushion-it's more of a board with a cover-very hard with no give or flexibility. Overall, enough features that made it way to uncomfortable for my daughter. I returned it & got a different stroller."
2,"Not the greatest stroller, but the tray fits on Maclarens!!","Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this stroller has several weak points (difficult harness, shallow seat, poor maneuverability, etc.). HOWEVER...I discovered that the tray fits on my Maclaren Quest, and that has made it worth the price! Now my Quest has become a near-perfect stroller! I wrote this review in hopes that some other person willing to go to great lengths to get a tray on their Maclaren stroller will benefit from this little discovery."
2,Not what it seems,"I was so happy when I found this stroller like others have said it had a storage basket, lightweight, snack tray, and cup holder all hard to find in a lightweight stroller and it was affordable. BUT the seat was to small the clasp was really difficult to get my child out of and it was hard to stear. Don't be fooled by the 39.99 price! I returned mine and am still searching for a better stroller. Maybe a graco literider?? Wish I could give 0 stars!!"
1,Awful,"I wanted a new lightweight stroller for our younger son (almost a year) and this one looked great. I used it today and I am going to return it tomorrow. My thumbs are red and swollen from trying to unbuckle the straps and when I went to get him out, he was so far forward that he could have walked out on his own!! My son is an average size so that should not have been an issue. I agree with what everyone else said about the size of the seat, steering (we were on a smooth sidewalk and it was tough), closing it was so hard that my husband had to do it when he got home, and those darned straps! I am so disappointed - I will certianly research more before I buy another stroller."
4,"Not perfect, but not all bad either","We have been using this stroller as our ""on the go"" stroller for 5 months now. We keep it in the back of my station wagon and it takes up minimal space there. No real complaints except that the buckle is very stiff and hard to undo. It's fairly easy to manuever and is much easier in the mall than my fullsize stroller. For $40 bucks, it works."
1,Very poor quality,"I bought this stroller because it was light weight and had all the features I was looking for. (Recline, large basket, large hood, parents cup holders etc). We used it for 6 days and started to have problems with the front wheels not turning, then the brakes broke. I called the manufaturer who was to send us replacement parts. Two months later they are still on back order. After calling and complaining to the company numerous times they now have offered me a refund. I highly recommend not buying this stroller."
2,Ouch!,"OK, there are a lot of good points about this stroller, it was reasonable priced and had a lot of storage space but it was nearly impossible to unclip the belt. It almost made my fingers bleed! I thought it might loosen up over time but almost a year later it still kills me every time."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful!","This is a terrible stroller-I too have had chunks of skin taken out of my hand twice now! It's so hard to get the clasp undone and done up-I don't know what the problem is.The wheels/steering on this stroller is AWFUL as well. It seems like the wheels are constantly jammed and it's not going anywhere.I only have one son (7 months), but tend to have a diaper bag and bags from shopping. I thought I'd be able to 'steer' one handed and handle this stroller. Not so! I ususally carry my little one (he hates the stroller) and the stroller is going this way and that-I've been tempted to just leave the awful thing in the mall!Needless to say; we're going to try and return it-if they won't take it, we'll throw it out. It's TERRIBLE!"
1,Be careful,"I thought this was an excellent stroller with the looks, storage space, lightness and other features UNTIL it folded on me. My daughter is 21 months and 25lb, not a heavy load. She got her finger stuck in between the bars and the skin got sheared off the tip. This stroller folded on me a total of 4 times in 1 month before she got injured and I returned it. Be especially careful over curbs, train tracks or any type of a bump in the sidewalk."
2,Terribly Difficult to close,"I generally like this lightweight stroller, but it is a pain to close! Also doesn't lay as flat as most smaller strollers. But really my biggest complaint is having to really press the button hard with two hands, wiggling it for it to work right. After a few months, I feel like the closing mechanism is going to break because of all the work put into having to close the stupid thing! i thought maybe I bought a defected one, but it appears they are all like this. Otherwise, it does roll easily with my now 18m old and has a decent size basket and cup holders. Oh, I also took notice that the material on the seat is already starting to tear, and my child is not in it all that often. I don't see this product lasting long."
1,Do NOT buy this stroller,"This is my 3rd baby trend stroller. I was happy with the first two (snap and go and jogging) but will NEVER buy another baby trend product after the TrendSport. I can not press in the button to close the stroller unless I use two hands and it still is very hard. I have sent it back TWICE now to baby trend since Babies R Us said it has been too long and twice it has came back the exact same way. I asked for a refund but they said no. So, I just contacted them to send it back a THIRD time. I don't want a stroller that I can not easily close. I have since purchased a Chicco Capri that I love and will not be buying anymore baby trend products."
1,So disappointed...,"I wanted so much to like this stroller. It had everything I wanted: cupholder/tray for me, cupholder/tray for baby, big basket, lightweight. HOWEVER, my poor baby looks miserable sitting in it. My 14 month old is 23 pounds and his little belly presses against the tray. There is no room for him to sit, only about 6"". The buckle is extremely difficult to open and close. The wheels are flimsy and I was just waiting for them to fall off today. It doesn't handle well. WHen trying to close it and get it back in the car this afternoon, it took several minutes to figure out why it wouldn't close all the way - the wheels have to be in the flat position...Not what I wanted... THink I'll take it to the Salvation Army. Maybe someone else will like it."
1,Don't Buy This,"We were looking for a lightweight, inexpensive stroller. What a piece of junk this is. The buckles are so hard to work they practically took off the ends of my fingers. The wheels are flimsy, and the steering is a joke. The part of the 3-point harness that goes between the legs pushed right up against my son's privates, and that was the only thing keeping him in this thing. He screamed the last time I tried to take him shopping in this, so it went back to BRU. Buy something else. Anything would be better than this thing."
2,just average,"Scarface is One of the Baddest Rappers Ever to me&on His Last Set 'The Fix"" things seem to Be rolling back in the right direction.but aside from the Diss track on 50 Cent nothing else really stands out for me.this is the kind of Album that Scarface seemed to do through going through the motions."
5,One to keep with you,We love this book. It has helped us sort through all the choices of campgrounds out there. Fun to read and imagine all the places we can go!
2,general description,"there is not much additional information about the campgrounds, just tells you where they are, not better than any www description, although there is a rating, but we found it to highly rated. Not wort bying this book."
4,Nero Wolfe fans,"I do not know if I like Hutton's directing and format but Maury Chaykin is arguably the best actor to ever play Wolfe. What an incredible performance. I shared this with some not familiar with Nero Wolfe books and I think they really liked it. Or were they just being polite?! As to Hutton. He and friends funded this risky TV series, again, and saved some great stories for posterity. Netflix or Amazon may have all the Hutton-Wolfe videos. Check them out. Thank you Tim and friends. Thank you very much Tim. You are a good man."
5,Best Anime Ever?,"Possibly. The amazing colour that goes into everything creates a fantasy world. The characters are as different and variated as in reality. And the music. Ah, the music. Not enough can be said about the music to express the unhindering awe I have of it. All in all, everything is simply perfect.I'll admit, the first time I rented the first DVD, I got so lost in the voices, colours and music I didn't pay much attention to the plot. The plot is very complex and confusing at times, since while there isn't a lot of action, there is a lot of talking and theor[ies] and to remember it all is hard. However, once you start to weed out the important aspects the series is really amazing. The character relationships and grow of the characters is really something to look at.Overall, if you're into fast paced anime, I'll agree, this probably isn't the anime for you.However, I have found it extremely enjoyable and would recommend it to those with a lot of paitence."
4,.HACK is the mack for all ages,"Best cartoon series on at this time. No sexual scenes or nudity. No language that makes a parent dive for the mute button on the remote. Depth of charecters is able to followed by both adults and children without dumbing down or talking over an age specific intellect. Plot is deepening as we continue to watch all the current episodes and own both of the DVDs out right now. As we follow the charecter Tsukasa, we are pulled deeper into his past as well as his fantasy world. As for the soundtrack, my daughter really loves the title song ""Obseesion""."
4,Good for larger lenses; too large for Micro 4/3 lenses,"This is a nicely made, low-cost lens case, with a simple drawstring (not the poorly-designed elastic draw string on Zing cases, which too often causes dropping or banging the lens). It also has a firm base. It's good for ""big"" DSLR lenses.I hoped to use it for the beautifully small Olympus m4/3 lenses, but I find that it is really too big for them: it's designed for larger-diameter lenses. It'll work, but Olympus really needs to design cases specifically for m4/3."
5,Great little book,"Picked this book up at the library and thought it was so informative that decided to buy my own copy at Amazon. My husband was going to India so we both read the book and used quite a few of her suggestions plus he took the book with him to have for a reference. This is very much in the realm of natural health...herbs, etc. and she has some great ideas about staying healthy before, during and after your trip."
2,"Good to watch, not to buy","As a fan of samurai movies, anime and having watched the original 7 samurai, this movie was mildly entertaining. The story line was decent but aside from the character development, I found it quite empty. An annoying kid, and a bumbling fake samurai (at least the original was somewhat competent) distracted from the already quite shaky adaptation. In my opinion, it is interesting to see where the characters go and how their pasts and paths unfold but not something I plan on watching again anytime soon."
4,Great fun!,"I know nothing of animated movies... My wife and I like and enjoy our cartoons and over the top action. This had that and more. Good story, deep characters, enjoyable action, and of course oh my gosh I can't believe he just did that...Anyway we watched it with our kids and while there was a little bit of bloody violence I did not find it excessive."
3,An interesting view of Thoreau's life,"Since this book was written by Edward Waldo Emerson, son of Ralph Waldo Emerson, he was obviously familiar with his subject. Henry David Thoreau spent time living in the Emerson house and was the substitute head of the household several times when Edward's father was out of town. He entertained the children and was remembered fondly by the young people of Concord. Here Edward includes those memories with his own and with excerpts from Thoreau's journal.While these facts and quotes are valid, they don't paint a complete biography of the man. Some of the incidents make sense only to the savvy reader who already has a Thoreauvian background. And only the first 50 pages are text; the remaining 30 consist of expansive footnotes. If you want to glean the full story, you'll have to constantly page back and forth. Yes, it's a worthwhile view that comes from a friend, but it's not the best or most detailed chronicle. An optional read."
4,Who cares if Exploited went on to be metal......,"Exploited is one of those bands love or hate them... At best they're the offical cartoon band of punk and then metal... But, in one shape or form this band has survived. This album is fast and heavy but, keeps the same funny vocals and lyrics that one can expect from the Expoited. Theres a very cheesy guitar solo in Holiday in the Sun. Lots of Wattie not wanting to do anything and how everyone is a bastard. Seems Wattie is still reeling over the late eighties to mid ninties rumors and accusations that more or less destroyed the exploited.... But, hey if you've stuck it through with this band and know whats up this a good album. The last track more or less sums up Watties frustrations and is quite good. Has more of the old exploited sound to it and feel."
4,Strangely..,I liked what I heard of this album. Musically they have gotten alot better but lyrically they are just as uninsightful. I figured it was just gonna be a cheesey punk record and maybe some of the lyrics would go to an act with no brainpower what so ever but I was really impressed with the music.
2,The Exploited Lame Out The System,"The release has excellent sounding production. All the instruments have a great live mix to them. And Wattie is one of the best shouters out there!!! Unfortuneatly, the lyrics are pretty lame. Every word is practically an explicative. Don't get me wrong, I don't need Socrates influenced lyrics but these lyrics are plain dumb. What happened to the Wattie who hates the government machine????"
3,good overall but,"I like this album. I like pretty much every song, and I USED to really like Never Sell Out. But can I tell you what knocked a star or two off my rating... The other day I heard two young girls with perfect make-up and expensive clothes singing Never Sell Out! And that's not all - they continued to start trying to remember who it was by. ""Hmm"" said one ""I think it's a punk song - it's probably Greenday or Blink 182"". I marched on over to correct her, and had to know where people like them had heard such a song. ""MTV2"" was their answer. Now I realise that these people were stupid and Never Sell Out does NOT sound like a Blink 182 song, so that didn't knock the star off. What then did? Could it have been the fact that a song with that particular title was being played on MTV and hummed by kids in the street? As you can tell, this really annoyed me. I can only hope that the exploited never DO sell out, and that I won't catch them on MTV again in the near future."
2,Wattie died...,"To warn the fans of the 'real' Exploited, I must say this is now: this sounds NOTHING like ""Punks Not Dead"", ""Troops of Tomorrow"" early 80s English Oi! stuff. It is essentially a crusty-metal album, an attempt for 40-year Wattie to sound like a mix between ""God Hates Us All""-style Slayer and Aus-Rotten. I say attempt because I find this to be inferior to early Exploited and any crust and metal bands there. It is music without a real direction, seemingly created to look ""hardcore"" for a dying band who has abandoned their punk roots altogether, for the most part.I hate to negatively review for what seems like such a stupid reason, but fans of early Exploited will understand how horrible this is when they hear it after listening to their ""Punks Not Dead"" LP again. I suggest not buying this unless you are a fan of modern metal, because it is not The Exploited most of us know and love."
1,Metal > Punk. This is poser music.,"I don't care if this band used to be punk and started going metal, they suck.I haven't seen such a worst vocalist since emo bands.the guitar solos are nothing to brag about, anyone hear of DRI, Suicidal Tendencies, or Anthrax??........."
3,Exploited,"I've been a fan for awhile now and I finally had the time to get this CD. I don't know why people consider this crossover/thrash. Because it's not. And no, it's not ""poser"" music. It's just pure punk, it might sound diffrent, but it's just punk."
4,Taunton's Complete Illustrated Guide to Turning,"Strong on projects examples, perhaps less strong on technique. The book has many photographs of different shapes, sizes and styles of projects at various stages of turning process.However, the book is weak on tools with little to nothing on lathe brands, country of source, types, power, speed control, sizes and setups. Perhaps it presents even less on tool and chisel brands, shape, materials, sizes and applications. It is a non technical book.The quality of paper, print, photographs and binding are excellent making this a book to be proud to own."
1,Good book don't buy the Kindle version.,The information was outstanding but when it converted to Kindle it lost a lot. The Kindle version FUBARs the illustrations in that they are separated from the text. Buy the printed version!
4,great starter book,"Finally started turning, read almost the whole book twice. Very informative from nomanclature to turning. Love this book.Everything to get started in wood turning.I wood recommend this book to purchase if you have never turned on a lathe or have just a little experience."
4,Good reference manual but lacks some specific detail.,"I purchased this book as a new woodturner looking for some guidance on where to start. It provides some great all generalized information about all aspects of wood turning from safety to finishes and everything in between. I still find that I use it frequently even now that I am more of an intermediate woodworker. Richard Raffan is well versed in all things wood related and the information is presented is clear and concise. That said, don't expect too much detail on any one technique or approach to a particular project. While this a is a great book for an overview of wood turning it does not always answer the question you picked it up hoping it wood contain. High recommended for a the person thinking about getting into turning but there are more detailed manuals/books out there for specific applications."
4,Another solid edition,"Edward Hoagland has done a wonderful job in selecting a breadthof essays that radiate his and others various interests. The 1999essays takes us from the horrors of sexual abuse to the significance of Job to the beauty of ""bogs."" I particularly enjoyed David Quammen's ""Planet of Weeds,"" an essay so compelling and upsetting that I sat shell-shocked after reading it. As usual, Ian Frazier impresses, and I particulary enjoyed Toure's ""What's Inside You Brother?"" My only disappointment is that the work doesn't have an essay from Hoagland; his modesty prevails."
2,Just OK ! nothin special about it.,"This DVD just does not fit in whatever written on its cover. Apart from a few shots, scenery is not good enough. I am sure if it was carefully thought and locations were properly selected, this could have been the best WMVHD DVD, unfortunately, at the moment its not."
1,Disappointing & expensive,"I've been to Hawaii, and this material does not reflect the marvellous and spectacular landscape of those islands. Moreover, the DVD is too expensive as compared to other WMVHD editions."
3,"Not enough details on what makes ""Real Ale"" real...","There is no shortage of books which attempt to replicate commercial beers, and this book is not much more than that. I haven't tried brewing any of the recipes, although I'm sure they really do come close to their commercial counterparts. What I was looking for, though, was very specific details on the technical aspect of cask conditioning ale and the equipment involved. This book does not help much in that regard. It explains cask conditioning as the equivalent of bottle conditioning, but in a 'cask' which it only describes in a page or two.If you are looking for recipes trying to emulate Real British Ale, this is the book. If you are looking for more information on brewing and storing cask conditioned ale, the details are insufficient."
2,In war one always thinks the other side is more competent,"This book concluded that the examined weaknesses of the Contras would lead to defeat. This turned out to be incorrect, since Contra activity was one of the reasons why Sandinistas were replaced by elections, and a shaky but real democracy. Such evaluations are common in war for those participating in conflicts tend believe that their enemies are more competent than they really are. However, there is useful information in this book."
2,Not his best,"I absolutely love Tony Jaa's movies. His movies are the only martial arts movies I'll watch.But this movie sucks. I love Ong Bak 2, but 3 is so damn BORING.Instead of taking the route of the second film, they focus more on supernatural aspects and more on good vs evil, rather than a story of vengeance. Half the time I was watching I was asking myself ""what the hell is going on"" because the subject matter is so distant from that of the first two films.85% of the movie Jaa is crippled or recovering from being dead, so there's less fighting and more whining and tantrums about being crippled. The only decent display of action from Jaa is approximately 10 minutes before the end of the movie, and it's still not his best performance.I would expect any Tony Jaa fan to watch this and form their own opinion. This is simply my opinion, and damn was I disappointed."
3,ong bak 3... well...,"for the most part, i praise Jaa for his directing/acting ability in this one... his stunts are creative and he does what he can to out-do himself, but for me, this film stays as a rental ONLY. i wouldn't buy this. ong bak 1 and 2 i own and they are killer, hands down, but what Jaa needs to understand is he needs to slow down a bit... concentrate on story material and good dialogue. without a good story, why bother... Jaa, if you're reading this, big respect to you and your stunt crew! next time, come up with a great story and let someone else direct, for now... you do what you do best and show us killer muay thai! rock on..."
3,Ong Bak 3 : The return of the Jaa,"The Jaaman is back in a solid entry in the Ong Bak saga. Another beautiful looking film that shows the softer side of his character. While not as amazing as OB1 or OB2 it still has some great fight scenes. The fights are more dance this time around but there's no doubt Jaa is still king. It does slow down during the middle as he goes into Zen mode. They really could have trimmed the length to tighten up the film. The cast is great but there's not a lot for them to do in this one. I hope that Jaa spends more time in front of the camera for his next film. There's plenty of time for him to direct in the future. If you're not a fan of OB2 then you may want to rent this one before you buy. This is my third favorite of the Ong Bak films. Extras include documentaries, behind the scenes and cast interviews."
4,Could have been Better but still good.,Ignore the people who down this film. Their problem is they want 24/7 action.This movie picks up right after the second and puts you right into action. He is captured tortured but still fights back.Following these events there is a chunk of the film used to see his recovery and what is going on with the King and Crow as well.After that is when we are thrust into the final confrontation.My only problem with this movie is there is a part where after a really good fight the movie coulda ended there but Jaa decided to try and please both crowds who wanted a certain ending.You will without a doubt know this scene when you see it.I will say still see this movie but get it when its marked down. The fight scenes are still good and this movie aside from scene mentioned above is well rounded.
2,Better than #2 but not as good as #1,"It's better than ONG BAK 2, but not as good as the first one. Both share the same over-kill problem so endemic to martial arts films in general: fights go on just too long...and too often. That's one reason Jackie Chan's American films were so popular: fights are cut down to a reasonable length. But that's catering to American tastes, apparently. I gather Asian audiences like the fights to go on and on and on. But getting back to this film, I can think of no other film where the lead character spends so much time comatose before reviving and triumphing. I like Tony Jaa and think he's amazing. But I do think he needs someone else to direct him. He gets a wee bit too self-indulgent when he's the only director."
2,Disappointed,"Visually stunning, yes. Some cool action, yes again. Was it as good as part 1 & 2, NO. I felt as though in part 1, Jaa showed us what a bada$$ he was with the stunts and bone-crunching fight scenes. In part 2, he showed us his adaptability with the various forms of martial arts. Part 3, he was all about story telling. Which is fine, but all this magic and dancing when Jaa is an ACTION star? For me, I was disappointed."
2,A Huge Disappointment,"I saw Ong Bak 2, and it was great, but if you want to watch this movie, watch the first five minutes, skip the next hour, and watch the 20-30 minutes left unless you want to see an hour of Tony Jaa laying down unconscious, waking up mangled, regaining his strength only to then spend his time sitting, dancing very slowly, sitting some more, dancing some more, and, you guessed it, sitting once again. The end was the only part worth watching, but sitting through the rest of the movie even made that part less exciting than it should have been."
3,Its Time For Tony To Come To Hollywood,"10 minutes of backstory. 30 minutes of filler, and about 25 minutes of action. Slightly disappointing. I think its time for Tony Jaa to come to Hollywood. Mix him up with Director Tony Scott, and lets see what happens?"
1,Skip it,Don't waste your time or money - his previous films are much better. Half the movie has to do with him recovering from being captured in Ong Bak 2 and from beatings the enemy gave him in the beginning of this picture. The fighting scenes aren't anything special either compared to what Tony Jaa is capable of doing.
1,Why you should not watch this movie...,"The video quality was atrocious, the cinematography was amateur, the acting was sub-par with few real characters, the story made no sense and the fight scenes were uninspiring and stale.To give some background: I didn't care much for the first OngBak, but I did enjoy the second and was hoping the third would carry over some of the intense action and story. This was not the case and I was left feeling like I wasted my money. Better to skip this movie and imagine your own ending to the second film..."
1,What a disappointment!,This movie didn't make any sense at all. Pretty much the same action moves you've seen from his other movies...blows to the head with his elbows and knees. How can he exact revenge on his murdered parents if the bad guy is already dead?!? What a waste of time watching this
1,Should have listened...,"I did not think this movie could be as bad as some of the reviews said it was. It is. It drifts back and forth between boring and stupid. What little ""action"" there it has is mostly ridiculous hocus pocus nonsense. One cliche filled montage after another. Then there is one fight scene at the end. As others have said, don't waste your time."
2,Not as good as the others,"Although 3rd in the series, and it picks up where the 2nd one left off, it has a pretty weak story line, and jumps around too much. Didn't care for it as much as the 2nd one. Excellent fight scenes! just a weak story...."
3,boring movie,"The movie is slow and boring, too much talking and too much about Thai superstition. Disappointing movie, even the fight scenes are lamed."
3,America's critic,"It is ok, i so expect more, i want to watch ong bak 1 again, this one falls short less action and stunts, i want to see tony jaa, donnie yen, and jet li in a movie where they fight each other, and call that ong bak reloaded!, this prequel did not deliever!"
2,A hack job,"Ong Bak 1 and 2 were great movies. The martial arts in the first one was amazing, and the cinematography in the second was breathtaking. There is not much to like about this one. The story is meh, the fighting is meh, and the imagery is meh. Its not a BAD movie, but a sever letdown from the other two."
4,Looks good lacks substance,"It's an action movie not citizen kane so it keeps your attention long enough to get to the action scenes which are very well done. Story is meh...but you don't watch these movies for the story, you watch them to see a guy use an elephant's tusks as a tilt a whirl to beat up the bad guys. The dubbing and subtitles aren't great though."
1,It is No Fault of Pavarotti,"The first eight songs on this CD appear to be either studio outtakes, or very badly recorded concert material. The ends of several songs are faded off too soon; Pavarotti is still on the note and you do not get to hear him finish. These bad edits, plus a lot, and I mean a lot, of distracting, unpleasant, and surprisingly loud background noise, mar what could have been a bargain. But it is not. And although I think 10 songs is a bit stingy, may I emphasize that the real problem is the abysmal noise and amateurish edits. The last two songs are fine. I recommend that you spend a bit more and buy another Pavarotti CD. He was great. This CD is terrible."
2,Christmas with Pavarotti -- Not the Best,"Christmas with Pavarotti has some flaws, mainly that of the 10 songs on the CD, two are arias not particularly associated with Christmas (at least by me). Also, the sound quality is compromised on some of the recordings. It sounds like the songs were recorded before a live audience which is OK, but the quality suffers accordingly. I hope that somewhere, out there, there is a better recording of Pavarotti singing ""O Holy Night"" as his voice sounds strained and the recording ends abrubtly. If you like Pavarotti, this is an OK CD, but I don't consider it his best."
1,Amazing vocalist + Great music + AWFUL recording = Unpleasant Album,"I REALLY hate to write this, but the recording quality is SO poor that I must urge people to avoid this CD in favor of the other Pavarotti/Three Tenor Christmas CDs out there. Honestly, this sounds like the ""audio engineer"" had a cheap tape recorder and sat towards the back of the auditorium. Yes, there are some great older recordings out there; this is MOST CERTAINLY not one of them. Avoid, and buy Pavarotti's other Christmas music instead."
5,Personal Alarm Clock,"I use the vibrating function so as not to awaken my wife. And it fits nicely in my hand, also."
2,"Ah sigh! why do all of the ""Cassie"" books have to be silly!","I,like everyone else here have not read the book but im certain i know what it is going to be like. Just another silly/funny Cassie book that dosn't actully take the plot anywhere and is just a waste of time to read. I've read every other Animorps book and think that they're great. Why does the books featuring Cassie have to be dumb. Oh well maybe next time.John Smith (yeah right)"
5,ANIMORPHS #24 : The Suspicion,It all starts when the Animorphs find out that the Yeerks arn't the only invaders. There are some new enimies called the Helacromes. They're no bigger then a grain of sand but heres the catch they found the blue box and they use it. But insted of having somthing that makes them able tho chang shape they turn it into a machine that makes things grow down to theire size therefore making the little aliens a big problem.
3,FUNNY BUT STUPID BOOK,"I DID NOT REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK. BUT HEY, I DON'T REALLY LIKE CASSIE. IT IS A PRETTY FUNNY BOOK. THE ANIMORPHS MEET A NEW KIND OF ALIEN. THE ALIENS ARE A MORONIC SPECIES. BUT THAT'S ALL I'LL SAY."
2,Strictly Below Average,"In this volume in the popular ""Animorphs"" series (about a group of teens who attempt to save the planet from invasion by alien parasites by acuiring the DNA of and turning into animals), the gang runs into trouble with a new group of extraterrestrials: the Helmacrons. These very small, very rude beings manage to get their hands on the blue box that is the key to the exclusive morphing power. So, the Animorphs have to get it back immediately before it falls into the wrong hands! This book has some humorous moments, and of course a little bit of action, but the plot is a bit weak, especially when compared to some of the thrillers that the author has wrote in this series. Unless you are a diehard Animorphs fan intent on collecting all the books, I would steer clear of this one and look for something with a stronger storyline."
4,james animorph book #24 review,"It is about the Helmocrons. They want to take over the world. There homasidle. For goodness sake there only a 16 of an inch tall..... Later there all shrunk,the animorphs and the controlers. Will they work somthing out...........! It`s a good book, it is like a sentince you can not stop in the middle of it."
5,Pretty Cool,This one's about these little aliens that try to get the morphing cube.It's pretty weird because the aliens leaders are all dead so they cant make mistakes!At the end the animorphs morph to Anteater and slurp em' up!
3,The worst Cassie Book,"This book was not only boring, it was a disappointment. After #19, I thought it would be more about Aftran and the other issues raised, but you have to wait till no 29 for that. This book has a very strange plot and introduces a new class of aliens, the Helmacrons which aren't that intresting. Some parts were okay, like when the Helmacrons shrunk Visser 3. I also liked the Helmacron log entries, they were funny. But Cassie seemed to be acting out of character, especially after no 19. This is a book I'll probably only read once or twice. Get it only if you're an Animorphs fan."
1,YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING,"GO AHEAD, ASK ME. HAVE I EVER READ A WORSE BOOK? THIS IS THE BOOK EQUIVALENT OF BARNEY. tHERE'S A DUMB SPECIES AND THE ANIMORPHS MAKE DUMB DECISICIONS, BUT HEY, EVERYONE LIVES BECAUSE ITS A STUPID BOOK. CASSIE IS STUPID. ""I REALLY LIKE YOU CASSIE' SAYS JAKE. YUCK!!!!"
1,Adventures of Robin Hood,"This video set is not what it was advertised to be. It is not the 5 seasons that this show aired. I have the first season, purchased at walmart for 5.00, it has 39 episodes on it. I paid 49.00 for your set and got 15 dvds with 4 shows each on it. That is 60 episodes. I didn't mind paying 49.00 thinking I was getting all five seasons, but I did not. Also the episodes are out of order.I am not happy at all"
1,"Beware, this is a complete waste of $$$","This DVD has been a complete waste of money. All it is about, is this CEO presenting his ""theories"" to a group of people, using awful powerpoint slides crammed with words and making all the classic mistakes of presentation (reading from inside the slides etc). What's even worse, is that he's being intentionally vague (to an extreme extent), introducing terms and theories without really explaining anything (just mentioning them) and bringing up examples that he has complete lack of knowledge about. Most of his statements are at least funny (e.g. ""When a company grows it needs to constantly change, because if it doesn't change it remains the same, it's very simple"").Well, at least this supposed CEO is using some smart sales promotion techniques by selling his DVDs by pretending to be some unrelated vendor and offering a used copy to seem like a bargain (which was actually new)."
1,Inaccurate,"Voodoo does not use dolls. Thats what happens when you believe in Hollywood. Again, Voodoo does not use dolls. Hoodoo does, but not Voodoo. This book should be called Hoodoo Kit, not Voodoo Kit. Voodoo is a religion akin to Shamanic religions who commune with God, nature and the spirits for the upliftment of humanity. Although, Voodoo is not a pacifistie-turn the other cheek religion and have rites for protection, it is not a blood thirsty religion as Hollywood portrays it to be. Thats what happens when people believe in Hollywood and books instead of consorting to a Haitian priest or priestess in the Voodoo religion."
3,don't play with fire,"be VERY careful if you're using voodoo to harm others because what you do to them could come back and hurt you.many experienced voodoo priests, priestesses, and practitioners say this, and strongly stress it.I believe it."
3,Its allright if you need a voodoo doll,"The doll is very decent coming with black and white pins. I also like the artwork on the doll. However the book is too commercial and extremely lacking as far as spells and history. There are no loa veves, explanation of them. No drawings, even of Papa Legba. Its good to buy if you need a doll only, however get a good book on voodoo explaining loa veves, and genuine voodoo spells. THEN incorporate this doll."
3,Miller is what does it,I've noticed that the two books miller co-wrote are better than the rest of the series. Perhaps Leigh should have stepped off of this project and allowed miller to take over. (Kind of makes me wonder why Leigh brought him in to begin with)
4,It's different,This anime is a lot different than the ones i am used to. I liked the story line but i just hate that a couple of good characters die.
2,bust,"How I wanted to love this show, but I just couldn't, there was something missing from it, and I think the fanservice was tame, too tame, like, there was none to speak of, I gave this show some chances, but I am done with it, I wouldn't buy it, and I stopped renting it, its too bad"
2,Get from the library,I didn't abide my own rules. I bought this book at a used book store for a couple of bucks and it was STILL TOO MUCH! I read it during the summer and could predict what was going to happen before it started. For a first novel it was typical. I really couldn't get into the characters. I didn't like either one of them at all. They both had horrible personalities. I felt at though Ms. DeMarco based her characters on real people. Did anyone else think Paul Newman?
2,The Difference Between Good and Bad Fiction,"Ugh. This book is confusing and boring. It has unbelievable characters and weird situations. I can usually read a good 400-page book in 3 or 4 days. This book is slightly more than 300 pages and I've been working on it for almost 2 weeks now. I dread reading. But, I always finish a book, hoping there will be a redeeming quality at the end. Not the case with this book.Much like Carol Wolper's Cigarette Girl and Secret Celebrity, I think the Hollywood mystique the authors are going for are lost. The whole world does NOT revolve around Hollywood, and some people can even get ahead in live without ""glomming."" Guess I should learn my lesson and stay away from Hollywood fiction.I was considering reading Cranberry Queen, too, but The Difference has turned me off from Kathleen DeMarco. She'll have to prove herself for me to pick up another of her books."
2,5 stars?? you have got to be kidding me,"This book manages to be dull and boring as well as confusing. I finished it, but it was an effort. Don't waste your time on this waste of paper."
1,Buyers Beware,"This is a great album, the problem is the so called remastered version released by ""Candlelight"" records, it seems to have been recorded directly from a vinyl record, the thing hiccups throughout the whole recording. Also they seem to have added an echo effect to all the vocals which were not necessary, the vocals are also not as pronounced as the original recording. My advice: pay attention to the record company you are buying Christian Death ""remastered/reissued"" CD's from."
5,Excellent,"Just put these on my 02 WRX, parts match exactly to OEM parts, fit and quality is outstanding. Certainly a quality alternative to the factory kits and at half the price! Would definitely purchase this again (in 100k)."
4,perceptive and frank,"Brendan Bernhard's book, ""White Muslim"" is a well written portrait of a young white man who became infatuated with the religion of Islam and converted to the faith. Mr. Bernhard's view is perceptive and frank, refreshingly unburdened by the overly familiar political considerations of correctness that tend to suppress the expression of what one really experiences and wants to say. It is the very liveliness of the author's descriptions of Islamic life in Manhattan that makes this book stand out.I would like to see ""White Muslim"" present pros and cons less, and stick to recounting the author's observations of the converts and their milieux, pre- and post-conversion, all the more. Overall, ""White Muslim"" is a fascinating and important book."
5,Love Historical Fiction,Great book. Enjoyed the reading and could not put it down. I love the faith of the characters and the comparison to true history
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a protective case for my PSP that could (at a minimum) carry my PSP, the power cord(s), and ear buds. This product doesn't deliver. This case would've been better if it was bigger, or even if it was smaller. The internet pictures make this look big, but it's a really nice oversided console case with well padded walls that only holds 1-2 UMD disks in it's compartment.I would recommended getting a smaller console case to protect the PSP console/screen, and then getting a toiletry, camera or small duffle bag to store the console case, power cords and games in."
4,works,I purchased this for my 96 toyota corolla and it was pretty much easy to installed. it works great with any complain.
4,Windshield Washer Pump,It fit and worked with some modification. I had to file the pump down a little to plug into the car receptacle.
1,Below expectations,"Boring, boring, boring.I kept expecting the story to get better and more interesting, but it never did.The mystery was laughable and the character development was wafer thin."
1,Don't bother with this one,"Amateur writing - words, even paragraphs missing; odd vocabulary selections. Hollow, self-absorbed characters suffering from unformed consciences and moral bankruptcy. Extreemist leftist/feminist political tirades that have nothing to do with the story. Self-rightous and judgemental. Hanging plotlines.I knew I wasn't going to like the book by Page 4 when the main character noted that her best friend was ""not deeply into feminism...""Like they say: Those who can't do, teach. I pity Anne Bernays' writing students (especially her potty mouth - very unbecoming). Don't bother with this one."
1,NOT IMPRESSED,"I thought this book was superficial and not very well written. There was virtually no emotion shown by the characters. They divorced and remarried in record time, and with nothing more than a vague nod to feelings. The back story of vandalism was ridiculously underdeveloped, as was virtually everything else in this book. I'd pass."
2,disappointing,"I purchased this book in part because it was supposed to be part ""thriller"". In fact, there is no mystery and no thriller. The crime happens early in the story, and thereafter pretty much disappears. It is not what the book is about. That would have been OK if the story was a strong one. But, as other reviewers have mentioned, there is really no emotional depth to any of the characters, including Dannie. There is no exploration of what makes any of the characters behave the way they do, and so the dissolution of Dannie's marriage has about as much feeling to it as a decision to go out to dinner. I was also dumbfounded by Dannie's observation that her daughter's new boyfriend must have a blue-collar background, because of his large hands. Dannie could not be that dumb. Finally, the title of the book -- ""Trophy House""- actually has little to do with the story. The house is in the story, but is not particularly important."
1,Vapid,"My personal rating system for films often gets me to a negative number based on ticket price--for example, an $8 film can get a rating from $8 to minus $8. I gave this novel a high negative number. I review nonfiction, mostly business books, so when I read fiction it is for enjoyment. This novel puzzled me...nothing to it, who are these people and who cares? It seems like it was a series of short stories, disconnected and unfinished. I was miffed at myself for reading to the bitter end, but as I was closing the book I thought of two words: vapid and insipid. I looked up the meaning of those words to be sure they described my sense of this book. Yup, they do. So all is not lost. It took me half a day to learn a couple new words."
2,not recommended,The author puts too many of her own political views in the text which doesn't have anything to do with the storyline.The reading is slow and not much is going on.
1,Yuk!,Tossed this out after trying it. Texture and taste were far below expectations. Seemed kind of mushy and pasty. Pricy to boot.
5,Anybody got a can of Raid?,"Bug, bugs, and more bugs (but what did you expect with a name like Bug City?). This book take the Shadowrun status quo and turns it inside out, as the great city of Chicago gets turned into an even more dangerous version of Escape from New York. The UCAS military has quarintined the city. No one gets in, no one gets out (yeah, right. That's the kind of talk shadowrunners eat for breakfast). Even so , Chicago just got more dangerous than a troll with an assault cannon. The bugs are out in the open, and they don't care who knows it"
1,Caller ID problem,"I hooked this up, but I cannot get the caller ID to work. The manual is no help, the 800 number is busy, and whacking the thing doesn't help."
1,Terrible Sound,"I've now returned two of these for the same problem - a terrible screeching sound. The first unit did it constantly and the second did it intermitently, especially between songs. One unit is a quality problem. Two units is a design problem."
2,You might want to check out Leadsinger microphone instead,"These Karaoke machines use CD+G discs. These are CD's that use a different format so that video can be included.The problem with CD+G discs is that they don't have very many songs on them. Many of the discs only come with 4 songs, but some of the newer discs have up to 16 songs.It also takes a while for the system to recognize the disc. So, if you want to jump around from song to song and disc to disc, there is a lot of waiting around.The fun thing about this system is that it does have a low resolution camera so that you can watch yourself as you sing.You might want to check out the Leadsinger microphone instead. It is a self-contained unit that comes with 300 songs. It is cheaper than this unit and has some neat features. You can also buy more memory chips for hundres to thousands of more songs and in different languages (but they are expensive). However, it does not have the video camera."
2,New! Slaughterhouse Spice Taste!,"Goes from a peppy ""cinnamint"" taste to a rendered animal fat taste. Toothpaste is nowhere near its expiration date. If my hubbie buys this again my mistake, and the above is an aberration, I will change my rating...but in the meantime, I think I will be breathing shallowly."
3,great price,i found this product at the dollar store. it whitened my teeth well and had a strong cinnamon taste. i only bought it because it was cheap.
3,Very basic as needed.,I was required to have this book for class. It explains statistics for healthcare very well. Great for someone who wants to learn the basics. The only problem was part of the answers were incorrect in the book. I hope that has been corrected in different editions.
1,"If you liked the book, avoid this one","A travesty! The book is loaded with wit, irony, humor, great characters. Someone decided to rewrite the story, cast the dullest actors available and put their audience to sleep. The most successful attempt at destroying Twain I've ever seen. I threw it away."
5,"""Getting It""","As a recovering alcoholic, sober for four years, I found this book difficult to put down. Dr. Drew has an understanding of himself that puts him in an unique position to show empathy for the addicted and yet not enable them. My favorite part is when he speaks of ""Getting It"" and how important that is for recovery. His postscript reinforces my belief that God is the ""It"" needed to recover. A brain on God is better than a brain on drugs or alcohol every day of the week."
5,Insight Into the Addict and the Care Provider,"A hard book to put down, I felt like I was watching a car accident in slow motion, unable to turn my eyes away, even from the gross parts. The addiction process and the methodology that is used to try to help the addicted is well explained in episodic scenes from the lives of several addicts in different stages of care. Excellent Insight develops over the course of the book about the relationship of the Care provider to the addict and why he is driven to rescue the terribly wounded. For those who have listened to ""Loveline"" for years on the radio, this details the other side of Dr. Drew and what drives him and why he should be considered ""Man of the Year."""
1,Nonexistent,I tried looking for Regina Swisher's and Heather Skyler's new novels but I can't find them. I'm beginning to think the books don't really exist.
2,creepy,"It's a sort of interesting look into the thoughts and feelings of a doctor who treats drug addiction. It's kind of scary in that way. As Mr. Fishman notes in his review, the good doctor bravely admits, in an indirect way, how contemptuous he is towards his patients, getting aroused by his female patients and casually toying with the idea of snuffing the more troublesome ones. It's probably good that we know this about our medical professionals, but it certainly is disturbing knowledge, to say the least."
5,Heart-wrenching war thriller,"In Dr. Drew Pinsky's latest thriller, brilliant and beautiful hacker Lucille Klaunderfausteners Jr. is reunited with the renigade Ex-Special Operations spy James Dremel. This time, they must fight the post-modernistic artist who threatens to take over their rural town, and take it's middle america lifestyle with it. Rife with thrilling gun battles, poignant scenes of loss and redemption, and shocking examples of some of the most brutal tourture ever put on paper, this book has been deemed ""most likely to be banned in denmark"" by the Starbuck's Barrista book club. Truly an epic masterpiece of brilliant design, Mr Pinsky's realsitic, gritty writing style is perfectly suited to such a plot. I strongly reccomend this book, and it's predecessor, The Star Gravel Anecdotes. Truly in such a time of need, this book has something for us all. Read with one hand."
5,You guys don't get it...,"For all the people who said this book was pointless and had no real meaning, then you guys obviously are not the ones to be reading these kind of books and making judgements on them. Also to the ones that critisized this book: you guys did not get the point of this book, maybe, if you had an actual addiction and not just reading it because Dr. Drew is famous then you would find this book more of a comfort.....Think about it for a while, and see what the real point of this book is :) (I am sure you can handle that, or can you?)"
2,Dr Phil is SO MUCH BETTER!,"The other reviewers are right about Dr. Drew being so full of himself. If you watch Dr. Phil, you will never see him talking about himself at the expense of his patients. With Dr. Phil, the patients come first. Dr Drew perpetuates the self-serving notion that drug addicts can't hack it without the kind of long, EXPENSIVE treatment Dr Drew offers, and he teaches them that they can't help themselves and drug addiction is not their fault. This is a bad lesson that is causing our society to fall apart. Dr. Phil NEVER stoops to this kind of blame-everyone-but yourself method. Dr Phil's method forces the drug addict to take RESPONSIBILITY for her problem and to solve it herself!Dr Drew is part of the problem in today's society. Dr Phil is so much smarter, nicer, and better. If only there were more Dr Phils and fewer Dr Drews in today's addiction treatment profession. Unfortunately, Drew is the rule and not the exception. Too bad for us."
3,I used to really like Dr. Drew!~,I used to really like Dr. Drew!~Cracked: Life on the Edge in a Rehab Clinic...he's all about the dollars now....and making a buck off others addiction it's a reality show that pays people to air their dirt for money!...would never buy this book again!~
3,Can't find the book!!!!,"Ok, I gave the book 3 stars since that was the average rating. I can't even find the book in Canada!At the bookstore all I saw was multiple rows of Dr. Phil's face staring back at me!Seriously though, it sounds like a good book and don't worry about what people write here.BTW, I hope that one day you're as successful as Dr. Phil! ;)P.S. Please kick Adam in the nuts for me, ok?"
1,fake,"i went thru rehab and so did my friends and this book does a lousy job describing what it is like. most of it rings false, which is funny because this doctor is supposed to specialize in drug rehab. how come it reads like a bad novel then?"
5,My life was broken repaired by Dr. drew,"Dr. Drew, God Bless you. You and Adam are what keep me from going insane. I can't wait until your book comes out in paperback so I can give a copy to all my siblings and nieces and nephews.You are the man.You have made the world a better place.Take care. Please.If you ever make it to Seattle I'll provide your show with enough coffee to float a boat."
5,Excellent,This book is a must read for anybody who knows anybody with an addiction problem or is just curiouse to learn about it like i was. Drew doesnt pound you with facts and numbers but instead gives you real life examples of people he sees everyday and you get a real expirience instead of some person throwing stuff at you he has never expirenced.I think Drew did a wonderful job it was one of the few books that has kept me interested and not wanting to put it down. I really wish more people would recognize what a geniouse Dr. Drew is and how much knowledge he really knows.Drew and Adam not being on t.v anymore is a shame. The radio show is great but the positive messages and very important information these two saints give out every night should be boradcast to more people especially considering the times we live in today.Drew cant wait for another book!
5,A Great Movie,"Throughout the book we are guided by fluent narration describing day to day events in Dr. Drew's day job. Weaving several fictional characters into his routine, we see the struggle, pain and complexity of treating chemical addiction. The typical patient can range from the down and out street urchin to the wealthy upper class executive. We also get an idea of the people working in a treatment center. Rather than steering into clinical dogma it focuses on the human relationships that give birth to, sustain and transcend addiction. The book provides an interesting view through the eyes of this doctor always vulnerable to the manipulation of his patients -directly as they fight to find control of the situation and indirectly as each tragic story tugs at the heart. Through all of it Drew insightfully maintains compassion as he learns and grows as a doctor and human being. I kept thinking this could be a great movie."
3,Good read,This was good insight into what it is like working with addicts/mentally ill folks. It provides a look into the mind of the staff as well as the patients.
5,Couldn't put it down. An important piece for ALL to read,"I couldn't put this book down. So insightful, so raw, vulnerable and real; it makes you realize this is kind of truthful interaction is painfully missing from our society today.Such an important book for ALL to read. Doesn't matter if there is addiction in your circle of family or friends or not. It teaches you how to look at life realistically and how to manage the inevitable assembly line of problems. Amazing. Feel so lucky to have read it and have learned so much about myself which is impossible to do without seeing yourself in others. Thank you for the courage, care and sacrifices you have made for us, Dr. Drew. You are an inspiration to us all. Be open, honest, love and connect with all that is around you. And don't forget to keep the faith."
5,I need to talk to drew,"Dr. Drew you most likley don't read these anymore, but I really need to talk to you or someone, because from listening to the show I have developed a better understanding of myself, but still feel really alone, please could you email me at bubbles88@mogenic.com if you ever read this? I know it's a hassle, but I don't know what to do I'm to afraid to call the show because someone might recognize my voice, I wont say more because this is public, but please, if you read this email me. Please."
1,THE BEST!!,THIS BOOK IS AMAZING. iT HELPED ME OUT SOOOOO MUCH AND I LEARNED A TON. THANKS A LOT DREW. YOUR THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Disappointing Book!,"I ordered this book because of an interest I have in someone close to me. I found it to be limited in new information, (or any information). The author has a set opinion as to the causes of substance abuse and misses no opportunity to do an ""I told you so,"" with all his stories. He could well have boiled the book down to a chapter or two and been done with it. It was poorly and boringly written, and not in the least, self-serving. We now know the good doc is attractive to his young women clients and attracted by them, and admired by many. A far better book is Barry Meier's book, ""Pain Killer."" Lastly, if I were reading because of my substance abuse problems, I would be extremely discouraged as he offers little hope."
2,Smugly Preening Autobiography,"Should be subtitled Little Golden Thoughts of ME! by Doctor Drew Pinsky.This book is a typical product of our Narcissistic Age. Rather than give us useful information about drug addiction and its psychology, the author focuses on his own feelings to a ridiculous, almost obsessive degree. So vain and self-absorbed is this Pinsky person that his patients don't even register in his mind as living, breathing human beings. No wonder he fails them so often.If you are as obsessed with Pinsky as Pinsky is, then you will love this book. If you are looking for genuine insights into the psychology and treatment of addiction, look elsewhere."
1,"clueless ""healer"" harms patients","I HATED this patronizing, pretentious book.Dr Pinsky obviously doesn't understand women. All through the book, he fetishizes them as beautiful, helpless fashion plates who desperately need a daddy figure like the the wise, all-powerful Doctor Drew, whom they must obey unquestioningly. Any patient who doesn't immediately submit to everything Drew says is labeled ""borderline"" and is dismissed (maybe not physically dismissed, but mentally). Like too many medical doctors, pinsky has a definite God Complex. This will be obvious to anyone who has listened to his ridiculous radio show. With that kind of mindset, I'm really not surprised most of his patients don't get better under his care. It is a wonder he doesn't end up killing even more of his unlucky patients than he already does. If I had a friend or family member who suffered from addiction, I'd keep them miles away from a quack like pinsky."
2,ignorance is bliss?,"The author shows us addiction and recovery from a doctor's perspective. From reading this, I learned that doctors are people too. It was distrubing to read this doctor's thinly veiled description of his own erection while feeling up an attractive, female patient. Even more disturbing was the doctor's account of repeatedly switching a dying patient's life support machine on and off out of morbid curiosity. (I'm not making this up--it's in the book!)Even after years of professional training, the instinct to pulls wings off a fly is still there. Glad I'm not sick."
2,"Sorry to say it, but stick to radio, Drew.","I wanted to love this book, I really did. Dr. Drew is something of an idol to me, but writing is just not his thing. The dialogue, true to life or not, is uninspired, the sytax is something out of a phonics book, and Dr. Drew's inner turmoil feels extremely artifical and forced. Dr. Drew is at his best when he's innately diagnosing the pathologies of callers on Loveline. Rehashed sloppily into something that reads like it were produced sans editor, this was a throughly lackluster read.That said, Dr. Drew is the man! Dr. Drew in the hizzzzzzzzzzy."
4,Pretty Solid,I've listen to Dr. Drew for years. The stories were fascinating and extremely sad. There are segments of society that have a tough time and Dr. Drew helps them every day.
5,Thank you,"Over the years, I have had a horrible addiction to crack. I used to take it every night, or any other time i possibly could. One day, I noticed your book on the shelf at my local book store. So, I gave it a shot, I read most of it that day, and found myself not wanting to do drugs so much any more. I called in to your show about a month ago, but, unfortunately wasn't able to get through. After reading your book, I came clean about my addiction, got involved in a 13 step program, and am well on my way to ""cracking"" my addiction."
5,Never Play Leap Frog With a Unicorn,"I picked up the book after watching Dr. Drew on a late night show. The most profound statement in the book was the definition of ""mentally healthy"". After a mental journey of ups and downs in Dr. Drews' life and his patients you come across this wonderful paragraph. Like me may not have ever tried a drug in your life, but everyone has bad things that happen to them.Thank you Dr. Drew. Thank you for sharing your compassion, and gift with me. It is amazing how one little thing can be profound to one person, but overlooked by millions. I guess for me realizing that it is perfectly acceptable to feel not-so-great when you are dealing with bad things - that was when I ""got it"".Joi-An"
2,"small time, and always will be","Amen to that, Gunther! Everyone see how it wasn't Drew who got to interview John Kerry and George W. Bush on international TV? There's a good reason Drew Pinsky can't be trusted to go on prime time and talk to important people. It's because he doesn't have the insight and dignity that Dr. Phil has and also because no one really respects Drew. Read these reviews and then go read the reviews for Dr. Phil. No comparison. People know a real healer like Dr. Phil when they see one, and they naturally respect him. And people also know a publicity hungry clown like Drew when they see one and they laugh at him when they hear him on a trash radio show smelling some idiot comedian's farts. How many fart jokes do you hear on Oprah? Can you hear anything BUT fart jokes on Loveline? That's why Drew ""interviews"" Pamela Anderson and Dr. Phil interviews the President. Simple as that. Now leave this page and go buy Dr. Phil's books."
2,Congratulations!,"Attn Dr.Drew...Adam Carolla may never realize his dream of ruling the world but if yours is to help people than mission accomplished.The Loveline show,this book and your previous one are great deeds from a good man.Thank you.P.S. I gave the book 2 stars just so you would read the review.Try not to get hung up on those low reviews so much! You know what you're doing. They'll catch up when they're ready."
5,DR DREW IS IN THE HIZZY!!,"I am here again praising Dr Drews book and putting down the people hwo didn't like it. What is with all these people who claim to be Loveline listeners but are bad mouthing Dr Drew's book? This book is not just a book but a piece of art and I think people should respect the tremendous work Dr Drew does for people. If someone is a Loveline listener then I do not se ehow they could not like this book, it is one of my favorite and one of my friends favorites. Shame on the people who don't respect what he is doing.Way to go Drew this book is awesome, keep doing what your doing!Can u mention me on loveline this is the 3rd review I have posted."
1,Not worth time and money,"I used this for three months and didn't see ANY difference. I exercise and diet, so, definitely this doesn't worth my money or time."
4,GOOD,"I have only used this product once. I noticed a nice difference shortly after using it. But most noticeably, was when I quit using it for a few weeks and I saw cellulite as it had previously been. I have since ordered more and hope to see the same original results."
2,Honestly a cheap scam avoid!!,I used this on my wife and really rubbed it in hard every day for about 10-20 min and saw little results over a one month period. Most of these creams are a big scam and are designed to make a fast buck off of consumers that are looking for a quick fix. My advice if you want to lose cellulite drop the doritos get on the treadmill and do workouts like you see on the biggest loser. A cheap bottle of this junk will not cure you!!
2,JUST OKAY!,I really didn't see any difference. The can lasted a long time and the smell was nice. I do feel like I could've spent my money on something else!!
3,Going to give it another couple of months,I purchased it in June and now it 9/2/2011 and just have a little left; can't really tell if it helped me as much as I expected because I work out everyday and try to tone up my arms with different types of light weights. I will buy 1 more bottle of this product. It lasts about 2.5 months.
4,One of the best,This book is a great one in explaining hard things in easier way. Easy and simple to understand the essential ideas for the topics. Covers a lot of modern approaches.
1,My kid wasn't nervous about the dentist UNTIL reading this book.,"My son, who is 6 1/2, was never nervous about going to the dentist. He's been a number of times now and he's had very good experiences. Then he got this book at school and now he's nervous about going. The pictures are fun and the simple repetition of words makes this a good book for learning to read, but the story does nothing to help kids have a good experience going to the dentist. If you want your child to feel comfortable going to the dentist, avoid this book."
1,scary for kids,"This book is very scary for kids and will make them not want to go to the dentist. Brushing your teeth alone does not make you not need to go to the dentist. The dentist should be made to be a good person that is actually there to guide and help the kids to have good oral hygene, and not a scary looking man with a hand drill. My 4 year old has never been to the dentist and the first time I mentioned it he started crying because he had read the book at school."
2,NOT UNSTOPPABLE,With in one year of owning this watch it stopped due to solar chip failure. Fortunately it was under warranty. I treat my watches with a lot of care / stewardship and for this to happen so soon is not good. Then the same thing happened to my Calibre eco drive after owning it for 14 months. If they never act up again I will be happy to change my reviews on them. The funny thing is I have a 1st year eco drive that has stayed working now for over 4 years...YAY. It is a plain strait forward time piece with out any of the complications or the perpetual calender feature of the other 2 I have. Maybe that difference is why this happened? I hope your experience with these watches is better.
5,Citizen - Largo BL514256P,"This is my second Citizen watch, both of which are Eco drives. Time will tell how well that system works, but my review of the Largo model watch is very positive. The gold tone version is quite elegant and works well for work and leisure. It's many features make this a great all around watch.Appears to be very well made and the functions are easy to learn and use.One improvement might be to add glowing numeral marks in addition to the glowing hour and minute hands that the watch has."
4,Contemporary Fan,"I chose this fan because of its contemporary look. Little did I know it came with a remote which controls both the light and the fan. This fan is reversible which means that it can be used in summer to cool and in winter to re-distribute the hot air. It also has a dimmer (operated from the control). This is a heavy fan so make sure it is properly mounted. A 2x4 in the ceiling won't do. So far I haven't been able to figure out how to control the fan without the remote which is why I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars. If you loose the remote, good luck I guess. Also if you turn the light off with the remote, you won't be able to turn it on at the wall switch, a bit annoying unless you can rig a three way switch.Other than that, this is a good fan and has a lower profile than other fans which makes it optimal for smaller spaces.I recommend this product."
4,Very quiet. Creates a nice down draft.,"Length:: 1:39 MinsWhile I think the price is reasonable for this quality, there are a lot of other ceiling fans available for a lower price. I would knock off a half a star for that, but overall I think this is an excellent fan, and I intend to purchase it for other rooms in my home. Other than the light sound of the wind generated by this fan, it is virtually silent."
5,Silent breeze,"The Minka-Aire is a heavy fan, so may require some structural bracing before hanging. The blades have a snap-in function that require no balancing. The soft lighting feature has one halogen bulb and dimmer feature. Once installed, it is controlled by a hand held remote control, or an optional wall mounted remote. It is without a doubt the quietest ceiling fan I have ever had. I couldn't be more pleased."
4,Great flush mount fan with remote,I purchased this fan over the Christmas holiday for my wife. She wanted a fan over our bed that could be turn on with a remote control. As it turns out there aren't many flush mount fan models that come with a remote control. I searched both my local Lowes and Home Depot and was surprised to learn that they didn't have what I needed. I came across this model on Amazon.com and decided to purchase it. It took me no time to remove the old fan and install the new one. The unit comes with a 100 W bulb and isn't an ordinary design. I hope it will be easy to replace the bulb when the time comes. The fan operation is very quiet which is perfect for the bedroom. The remote is easy to use too.
2,Faulty light cover,"The fan looks great, but the glass light cover cracked and fell down after it was up for about a month. I emailed Minka's customer service, and no one has responded to my message."
5,A fabulous fan,"This fan is extremely quiet and perfectly balanced. Additionally, the low speed is lower than I've seen with other fans, which makes it nice for gently moving air. On low, it almost noise free, and on higher speeds the noise is from the air moving, not the motor.Installation was easy, the remote is nice, and the light dims in a continuously variable manner.As another reviewer noted, the bulb does not give off tons of light (it can't compare to a 3, 4 or 5 bulb fixture that may have 300 watts of bulbs in it), so if you really need a lot of light that may be an issue. With that said, however, I would buy this unit anyway and find another way to put more light where you need it, since you won't be disappointed with the fan."
1,Caveat Emptor! (Buyer Beware!),"I bought one of these and the unit failed completely within 5 months of its installation. I contacted Minka, who informed me that they would not honor their warranty because the unit was sold by Amazon. (They would, however, give me the repair part numbers so I could buy them. Nice of them, wasn't it?) Now Amazon tells me that they will not honor the warranty because it was sold more than 90 days ago! So I'm out the entire purchase price of this fan....I find it incredible that Amazon offers goods knowing that the manufacturer will not honor his warranties.Amazon's business has to be built on the trust of customers who are buying products sight-unseen, and I believe their action here is a violation of that trust.I'll certainly not be buying anything associated with the Minka name, and having been burned once I'll have to be more careful before buying anything from Amazon that involves a guarantee of any kind."
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!,"Just having a remote control with no manual controls makes for tough troubleshooting. Had difficult time reversing the fan direction no matter what I tried. I tried to contact their customer service and was on hold for over an hour when a lady came on and told me that all their technicians went to lunch. She tells me that they'll call me back when they return. I still haven't received a call from them. When I called back I was placed on hold and heard my cue on line from 7 to zero, but they still won't pick me up. I had it at this time and decided to pack up the fan and return it for a full refund. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. This company is a joke and I don't think they even have a customer service department."
1,Buy another other brand,"Like others, my fan went out after a few months, and Minka Aire customer service could have careless at helping me figure out how to troubleshoot the problem. Their fans are too expensive to not work but a short time. Buy any other brand of fan besides Minka Aire."
2,"The fan is nice, but the light is horrible","I am returning the fan because the light quality is so terrible. The room is dark. Otherwise, I like the fan. Easy to install. I would get the wall mount control as well. It is weird to have to use the remote and that you can't turn the light on from the wall. Searching for a new fan..."
5,Perfect! Ultra-Quiet,We are thrilled with this fan. It was exactly as described. Unbelievably easy to install - very few parts.It is super quiet and we also like the modern design.I highly recommend this fan. If I could give it 10 stars I would.P.S. the remote control is wonderful and the light is nice and bright but it can be dimmed or turned off.
4,Love It,"This fan is very nice looking and met all of our expectations. The only negative would be the overall light input. It was not enough light to light up the whole room. We just bought an extra lamp and are very, very happy with the fan itself and the look.... very modern."
1,Warranty,"i purchased 2 Minka-Aire fans in Jan 2008.Recently each fan has a problem that is not covered under warranty. It will cost me over $275. to fix them, the price of a new fan.be careful if you want one of these fans. Only the motor has a warrant. The remote & the receiver have only 1 yr. and they are the problem."
1,Stopped Working,"Update - this fan stopped working five months after installation. Neither wall or remote work. Are contacting Minka for support. Will update based on quality of support. Initial Review - We got this fan along with some others and are disappointed in this one. The light it emits is very weak - don't expect to use it to light a room. The blades are cheesy plastic looking and pretty small for the size of the light. If we had realized this before, we would not have bought it. PS the other fans (Delano II and a couple of Casablanca fans) we purchased are great."
4,"Nicely Designed Fan, But.......","I would have given this fan a 5 star rating but I was slightly disappointed on one point. It has great eye appeal, easy to install, but the ""high speed"" setting on this fan is equivalent to a medium speed on other fans. You really have to situate yourself directly under the fan in order to receive the benefit of the air flow. I was going to tear this thing out and replace it with one that blew a greater volume of air, but my wife would have none of that. She told me that she liked the design of the fan so much that the functionality was a moot point. She said that if the fan went, I had to go also! I,m still deciding what to do........"
2,Nice fan....Light sucks,"Nice remote control fan...Moves air better than expected for a ceiling hugger.I bought 4 for a beach house renovation, then liked them so much, we bought 3 more for our home. After a professional install, had to return one as the motor died two days after installation.Lousy halogen bulb generates more heat than light. Bulbs burn out constantly. They are expensive and hard to find.Company unresponsive on this complaint."
1,Junk...DO NOT BUY...lasted 4 months....,"Looks good, appears to be well-designed, but the fan suddenly quit working. The light works, but not the fan. Minka warranty says you must return it to original place of purchase for repair or replacement...So far Amazon does not have a way to honor this as it falls outside normal return procedure.After contacting Amazon, they offered a 25% credit and keep the fan or return it for a full refund...I opted for the refund and they sent a UPS shipping label..so hats off to Amazon customer service."
5,The perfect fan,"Easy to assemble and very quiet. The low speed seems really soft, but definitely moves the air. High is almost silent and there is still a good breeze. The light is bright on high, and nice and soft on low. Just be sure you don't try to use a dimmer switch on the wall. It kept shorting out at first, then we took out the dimmer. The remote is good, but it would be really cool if it came with 2 so that one could be mounted on the wall and one could be used as a true remote."
3,Mixed feelings...,"This is a very well-made fan, nice design and the blade installation is very fast and efficient. But, the one I purchased is faulty because I cannot change the direction of the blades. Unlike most fans, it has an *electronic* (vs. manual switch) change-of-direction feature you adjust with the remote. Mine is stuck in ""winter"" mode, which I never use, so its effectiveness as a cooling fan is drastically diminished. I'm contacting the seller to see how they resolve this and will increase/decrease my rating accordingly. Fwiw, this is one of two fans I ordered from this company and the second one had issues too."
2,nice looking but doesn't move a whole lot of air,I have had this fan for 5 years now and was never happy with the air movement--I have it in a small bedroom but it just doesn't do the trick. At about year 4 I had lots of problems with the remote--could never change the direction of airflow and it always seemed to revert back to the wrong direction. Year 5 the fan stopped working and although the motor has a lifetime warranty I was happy to have an excuse to replace it. If you like a lot of air movement I think a 5blade fan might be better
1,Looks great. Too bad it stopped working.,"These are great looking fans. Silent. They move the air around. I bought two from different sellers on Amazon. BOTH stopped working! The most recent was 9 months after purchase. The seller Del Mar was great. They're sending a new fan. Whew. Unfortunately I still have to pay an electrician to reinstall. I wouldn't buy another minka fan, which is too bad, since they look great. Just too much trouble to replace."
3,Comments relative to purchase of Minka-Aire 42 inch ceiling fan,"In reviewing this product, please note that it was my belief that I had researched such thoroughly. Last night it was installed, and although I'm pleased, my only regret is with the blades. Having had a previous bronze ceiling fan with wood blades, I was taken back by the ""so called oil-rubbed bronze blades"". They were plastic - who would desire plastic blades in your living room. As a result, I will be contacting customer service to understand why this product was misrepresented. Would I make a recommendation of this fan to others? Yes, only in the presumption that the blades are replaced."
5,Excellent,"I wanted some fans for my house and wanted to check out Amazon. Lowes and Home Depot have several at a far less price, but these are fantastic. Well worth the money. Great look, great low sound, and great wind movement. 100% recommend these fans."
1,MinkaAire Concept II -problems,"Unfortunately, this fan has failed after only two years of limited use. At first sometimes the fan would reverse, other times the light would come on, and at still other times the speed would go from fast to slow. These problems were manageable as they could be fixed using the remote. But now the fan speed stays on slow all the time and just won't budge. Ceiling fans should last years and years. I would absolutely never buy another Minka product."
5,Quiet and efficient,I purchased this fan for the sun room off our living room which measures about 8 feet by 16 feet. Put 6 inch tongue and groove boards painted white on the ceiling first and then the white fan. Lots of windows facing south west so can get pretty warm. The remote is very handy and functional. The fan is beautiful and very quiet. Great clean design.
5,Awesome product!,Purchasing my 3rd one for the office. The one for the family room never stops only for cleaning and switching the blades from winter to summer for 6 years.
4,Great for the price,"After reading the one star review I had my doubts. The photos of this Truss System looked like most other truss systems that sell for MUCH more money, so I decided to go for it.The system is made in China. Assembling the system was straight forward... no rocket science required here.... It takes 2 people to put the truss on the stands (duh). The truss is solid. In order to transport the system I ordered a $30 Truss bag (forget the boxes... they were never meant to be used to carry this system). With Amazon Prime the 2 day shipping of the 50lb system was free.All in all, a great bargain for the price. I took one star off the rating because one of the plastic handles for the Twist-knobs was broken when it arrived... nothing some Superglue couldn't handle... just cosmetic stuff.Again, considering the price, a good deal. I'm happy with it."
4,Odyssey makes great products with horrible instructions!,"This is the third Odyssey product that I review. I love that this company puts out quality products. This truss is no different. It's sturdy, looks sleek, and has butterly bolts directly on the bridge to hold up to 8 lights which is a cool feature! This product has 2 drawbacks: (1) Odyssey's instructions are horrible. This will pretty much be a DIY project the first time. (2) Unless certain parts that require tightening are replaced with butterfly bolts as well, make sure you carry an Allen key whereever you go because certain parts will require it. Overall, a great product. Very satisfied!"
1,"Truss extremely difficult to assemble, store, and maintain","We purchased this because it was wide enough to fit over our sound table. Be aware that it is extremely difficult to assemble even with directions. The multiple cardboard storage boxes fall apart easily, so you will have to purchase additional storage or lots of duct tape and bungy cords. Also purchase several extra hex bolts, nuts and drivers because they will be easily lost every time it is assembled and disassembled. The best thing about this purchase is that we didn't have to pay shipping on the extremely heavy truss."
5,back cover read,"Every year thousands of Christians are challenged to commit their lives to Jesus Christ for missionary service. But what should they do next? In this book/study guide, Dr. Dan Bacon provides information, counsel, suggestions, checklists and resources to guide the seeker through crucial steps of decision-making, guidance, preparation and training."
3,Wait! A Better Collection is Coming!!,"If I were you, I'd wait because a much better collection is on its way (roughly Dec. 2014).Sam Nelson (Ricky Nelson's son) is actually raising money to restore the entire 435-episode series of ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and include the original commercials too! He hopes to have the entire series restored by the time ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" is inducted into the Smithsonian."
3,Ozzie and Harriet,"This was an OK collection because it was mixed with the boys old and young...meaning it was not in sequence. I didn't think it was put together well enough where I'd buy any more. I bought a few all at once thinking they were arranged by season, and was disappointed that they were not. I was not familiar with this series as a child, and looked forward to watching the first episode through the last....sorry to say, I am not sure that I even saw the first episode! Also there was too much of the older boy (David?) and his married life to his wife - forgot her name - and found it rather hum-drum. I was more interested in the first seasons, simply because I wanted to see why it had become popular to begin with....I never figured out why."
2,funky patchouli smell,"this was not the most refreshing and clean patchouli scent I have encountered...more musty, less earthy. I typically love this scent...just not in this particular soap!"
4,For Patchouli Lovers Only,This is a good everyday soap yet I found myself not enjoying a morning dose of Patchouli every day. May 2 soap dishes in the shower is the answer!
5,"Magnificent, Soul-Stirring Poetry","I've read and enjoyed all of Erdrich's fiction and was eager to experience her poetry when I got this book. I was not disappointed in the least.Her poems are rich, full of life, sparkling chunks of wisdom from a woman's life. My favorite poem was ""Advice to Myself"" in the chapter entitled ""Original Fire"". She captures the ephemeral nature of life so beautifully and eloquently. If you only purchase one book of poetry this year, make it this one!!"
1,NEEDS ACCESSORIES TO WORK!,"I just bought one of these 'NEW FACTORY SEALED' headsets - it looks great but what these guys are not telling you is that it will NOT function without a connector.Ok - so get one, right? Nope - Logitech doesn't even have one in it's support department, much less anywhere on the market. This is a total rip that ANY SITE would offer these for sale without a connector to make it usable."
5,A small book for such powerful advice,"Your Money Matters is a small book but provides such simple, practical advice. It is a quick read on what the problem is and how to fix it. If you want to find out how to be successful with your finances, no matter what condition you are currently in, this is the best $12 you'll ever spend. Read this if you really want to eliminate your stress and increase your peace in your finances."
4,Your Money Counts,The book was received in the promised time frame. The condition of the book was as described. I would buy from this vendor again.
3,"Foundational, solid, and best read with friends.",The best part about this book is it lays a solid foundation for what Scripture says about money.The hard part about this book is actually putting into practice what you learned.Read Your Money Counts with some like-minded friends.
2,Meh.,"I was required to read this for a financial planning class. Wasn't that impressed by the advice - I found it okay, but nothing I wasn't already aware of."
5,Excellent!,"This book came to my attention through a class told by Crown Financial. I have recommended ""Your Money Counts"" to numerous people and purchased a copy for my son. It is an excellent tool in learning how to budget and be a good steward of the money we possess."
2,Not copied from tape,"Although this is a very good selection of Tangos, the audio quality is not that great. Once i received the disc it showed the record dates, from 1948 to 1952 or so. These songs are copied from discs, you can clearly hear the clicks and pops. This is not stated anywhere on the package. If you really want a good selection of Tangos have at it but be warned it is of somewhat poor audio quality."
4,Collings: Good intro. to liquid Crystals.,"A concise, entry level book for laymen, Collings covers the fundamentals of liquid crystals such as phase diagrams, defects, applications, textures, etc. The absence of derivations is either a plus or minus depending on your background. He gives the reader all the information needed to start from ground zero."
3,Certainly not the best,"I generally love Lonely Planet guides, but this one is factually inaccurate in many of its addresses, locations, etc. The introductory sections, however, on history, language, and such are as good as they get in a travel guide."
3,Injustice!,"This LP guide is a pretty good guide to HK and Macau. Being a foodie, I think their food guide section does not do HK's gastronomical scene justice! Beautiful food galore on the islands and LP can't even manage to cover half of that wonder. Oh well ;) Otherwise, it is quite a comprehensive guide to what's there to see around HK and Macau."
5,Hair is Healthier With Every Use,"I did not order this but brought it from my local Wal-Mart! My hair was dry and lifeless so I went hunting for a healthier hair dress alternative!After buying the Coconut Oil by Palmer's, I went home and washed my hair and cut my ends and blow dried my hair. Took a quarter sized amount and rubbed in my hands then ran my hands through my scalp to my ends! Ater hair was completely dry I repeated and rubbed it through my hair and sectioned my hair for flat ironing! Took me 20 minutes to flat iron! My hair was gorgeous!!!!! I have been using it now for 5 month's and my hair is young and vibrant again...not to mention manageable!!! I am 56 years young and I look younger now just because of the Palmer's Coconut oil Hair Gro! Thanks for whoever invented it! I still have my first jar but I am buying another just to have when the other is gone!Want it on hand! Afraid I won't be able to find it when I need it!"
2,eh,certainly not meant for an introductory course but this book is just terrible in its explanations or lack thereof. i always had to look up the same information in other books or schools that post their material online. i'm giving this book 2 stars instead of one b/c i've had even worse textbooks.
3,Good Popular History,"This was a good, popular, history of Northern England, the Anglo-Scottish wars and their impact on Late Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Britain told through the prism of the Percy family. But the Percys appear and fade from this history with an annoying regularity. Also much of this history is reasoned conjecture...as it necessarily must be since documentation is rather spotty at times. This is not the fault of the author...the records, it would seem, just were not there to access.All-in-all a good and informative read about an area of British history in which little is in print for the average reader. A recommended read for anyone interested in British history...and, really, who couldn't be interested in British history...such an anodyne to the flood of American history that every press, these days, seems obsessed with."
2,The title is BS!,"I have been doing card tricks for a while, and I have to say that anything of Bob Longe's is a waste of money.The tricks in this book are terrible. These are certainly NOT the ""World's Best Card Tricks"". I can't believe some of this [stuff] is even in here.I highly recommend the reader to learn card magic from great authors such as Jean Hugard, S.W. Erdnase, and Arthur H. Buckley.If you are a beginner, get the ""Royal Road to Card Magic"" By Hugard and Braue. It is of MUCH higher value and the tricks in this book will be 100x better than the stuff that's in Bob Longe's books. There is absolutely no way you can be the life of the party with these tricks, as the author claims."
3,This would be better if original controllers were available,"I played Atari 2600 and 5200 games incessantly as a kid. When I saw this on the shelf recently it was an instant buy. While the graphics and sound are the real deal, I didn't much enjoy not having the original controllers to play them with, like the trackball, spin wheel, or paddle. Also, I could do without having to ""zoom"" in past the arcade cabinet facia just so I could have the game ""full-screen"". In any event, my favorites are on here, including ""Tempest"" and dozens of others. Not bad."
3,Meh. So so,I was actually craving the original controlers. The controls on this are difficult at best and near impossible at times. There are a lot of games on this but the controls are so difficult that it is maddening to play. The 3 stars is because of the amount of games on this pack otherwise it may only be 2 or even 1 star.
2,Not as Good as Original Games.,"I enjoyed playing these games when they were first popular, but playing them on X-BOX was disappointing. I was expecting them to be much better. The quality of the games was not what I expected."
4,Arrrggghhhh!!!!! Ripoff!!!,I SHOULD HAVE NO STARS UP THERE BUT I MESSED UP AND I CAN'T CHANGE IT. Red Baron is still messed up like it was in the PC version. THE TANKS AND OBSTICLES IN BATTLEZONE ARE BLACK!!! YES BLACK! TOTALY SCREWED!!! THE FIRST BAD XBOX GAME!Here is some good news. The Game Cube Rebel Strike 3 has the old ATARI STAR WARS ARCADE GAME AS A HIDDEN BONUS!!!! Select options chose passcodes enter rtjpfc!g then enter another code timewarp to unlock Star Wars enter freeplay to earn tokens it might even have the empire stikes back game too but I don't know.I agree it realy sucks that they left out 2600 Basketball. I said so in my review of the pc version. Champinship Soccer was another good one they left out. Why why why why why????Agggghhhhhhga!! Just saw somtehing called an Atari Flachback system. It looks like a 7800 system made by the people who make those game in the controler type games. The Space Invader one I got is realy sweet. It has Pheonix which kicks butt.
5,A LOT of information,"David Sokol did his research on this amazing - always-something-happening - town. Maybe you have to live in the town to truly appreciate the book. ... No, on second thought - Sokol did that for you. Oak Park is as full of individuals with individual thoughts with many, many comments and viewpoints. He shows a reader how Oak Park, IL got there and continues to be ahead of the norm for the nation."
1,"Oak Park, Illinois: Continuity and Change",I was disappointed in this book. I had hoped to rekindle memories of the Oak Park I remember from the 1950s but there was no continuity to the book just a hodge podge of pictures. A. Bower
3,"interesting, confusing and pointless - good mix","Being a fantasy based book, I wasn't drawn to it very much but the author has other excellent books to his name, so I thought I'd try it out. The planet in which the story takes place is set on a large planet with a ring of earth around its belt. The characters deduce that this is geologically impossible and can offer no explainations of this or of why they have come to this planet. The journey around the ring of earth is interesting at times (crossing the submerged part of the ring), confusing (being drawn into the mirror) and pointless (the country of the queen and sex with the queen). All in all, a very strange read. A book which will finish before you know it and you'll think very little of it."
3,"I've never noticed a lack of fleshed-out ideas or unique imagination from K.S. Robinson, no matter the subject.","""A Short, Sharp Shock"", author Kim Stanley Robinson. Nice, draws you in, but leaves you wanting for more, in a good way...unlike, for example, any of his other works that I've read or, your very first viewing of the MOVIE Stargate, or the novels Ringworld and Riverworld. Not pretending to be a writer...which would surely be fraudulent on my part - I at least can dream of a few places it could go, sure he has myriads of possibilities. A KSR read always draws me anyway. My 1st was 'The Years of Salt and Rice' (if I didn't get the title reversed) - I always wanted to thank him for that one. This is worth a read."
1,"WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHY?","I think GODOT is going to appear before there is anything meaningful about this story....It's not a story. It's a rambling puzzle, inside of an enigma.And there is something creepy about most of his characters. Especially creepy are the guys with trees growing from their shoulders and the fruit is eaten.Creepy."
2,Not like his other work,"I have read the Mars Trilogy and The Years of Rice and Salt and admired the author's ability to take a science or fantasy concept to the next level with detailed descriptions and well developed characters. Though I knew it would be different before reading, this short story was quite a shock.Dream-like in the way events transpire, the main character's journey seems to be a vehicle for the telling of many disparate ideas. The world and it's inhabitants are interesting as concepts, several of which are quite good, like the plant people, but the characters never reached the level of development that would have have made me believe or care about what was happening. I finished it unsatisfied.I can not recommend the book for fans of the work of Kim Stanley Robinson. Read The Years of Rice and Salt instead."
2,A little Slow,"I have read the Mars Trilogy and Antarctica, and really enjoyed them. One of the author's best gifts is the interactions between characters- in all of the other books, I found the introspections a bit slow- this story doesn't show a lot of connections to others- and so feels much less real than his others- I won't pass this one on to my friends-"
1,"Pretty, but random and unsatisfying","This fantasy story (it's in no way SF) kind of drifts along, collecting random scenes and images, which while often pretty never amount to much, and are often just plain daft. The plot is almost non-existent, which while I enjoy sometimes is not pulled off particularly well here. Nothing is resolved, and nothing really 'happens'. The protaganist is almost characterless, as is his female companion, and they essentially wander through the book in the only direction they can waiting for things to happen.Robinson is obviously a nature lover and this is the strongest element of the story. But pretty pictures alone, a good story do not make.I don't blame Robinson for writing it, it was probably a good exercise, but I can't believe it ever got published, let alone reprinted."
1,Nothing Here,"I'm a big Kim Stanley Robinson fan; this book is not the reason. No plot, no characters, no resolution. The reviewers who like the book claim that it has deep symbolic meaning. If you look hard enough, you can trick yourself into thinking you've found just as much deep symbolic meaning in totally random sequences of words.Not everything that makes no sense hides worthwhile philosophy. This book is an emperor with no clothes."
5,very please,I am very pleased with the service and the condition of this bible. Having the translation side by side helps in my understanding of God's word
5,Study Bible is Top Notch!!!,The Comparative Study Bible offers a side-by-side comparison of four of the most popular English translations of the Bible. The King James Version (KJV) and the New American Standard Version (NASV) are considered by many as the most accurate word-for-word translations of the Bible ever done in English. The Amplified Bible is almost a commentary on the Bible in offering many synonyms for key words or phrases as well as expansions of words or sentences to help the reader better understand passages. The NIV has become the most widely sold English translation in recent years and completes this versatile and valuable study tool. I highly recommend this Study Bible for private study as well as a study aid for both teachers and students of the Word of God.
2,Disappointed...,"The convenience of having four Bible versions in one is definitely unbeatable for those seeking to have a total understanding of the verses they are reading. The text is set up in four columns across a two-page spread which is great for comparison purposes. However, in this volume (Hardcover-ISBN-0310903335), the type (font) is so small and the pages are so thin that I find it difficult to read the text (the font is TINY and the words from the previous page show through) - and this coming from someone with 20/20 vision. I cannot imagine how it would be for someone of age or with less than perfect vision.I would recommend that you go to a brick and mortar store and see this Bible FIRST to decide if it is right for you. I wish I had actually seen the text before making an online purchase. I had planned to use this Bible as my main reading Bible but it will remain on the shelf, used only as a reference. Very disappointing."
4,Good reference comparative,"Good 4-version comparative, side-by-side Bible. It is not, however, by most definitions, a Study Bible. It has the individual word options that are standard in almost any Bible, but it has none of the notes, chain references, or historical notes that would be expected in the most basic study Bibles. It can be called a Parallel Bible, or a Side-By-Side Comparative Bible, but not a Study Bible."
3,KJV/NIV Parallel Bible,Type could still be larger. Not as easy to read as I had hoped for a large print version.
4,Great Reading,The Comparative Bible is great I must say howevr I am a little dissapointed to know that it has no concordance. It makes reference to things I may need another study guide for but it certainly makes ready a little clearer and more enjoyable
3,never received it,"I received an empty box, with notice from post office stating product damaged or lost....so never received item, and amazon was to credit my account for $$."
4,excellent resource,"This Bible is an excellent way to get 4 of the best Bible translations all together in one place. It makes it very simple to compare verses without having four separate Bibles open. I plan on taking it to Bible College with me this fall in order to save space that would have been needed for four separate Bibles. The burgandy leather cover is very nice. My only negative comment would be the small print, but I realize that with four complete translations, it would end up being a huge book if the print were larger."
4,Totally Comparative,"I love the completeness of the bible, only problem is that the writing is too small for me. It is unfortunate because if the writing or the font was larger it would be a huge book. Still, a good purchase"
4,A great gift for a real student,"The Comparative Study Bible made a great gift for my husband since he keeps borrowing the library's copy.Comparative Study Bible, Revised"
4,Useful Tool,"This is a useful tool when comparing the KJV to other versions. Much better than sitting with four different versions and trying to juggle them. Because of its nature, it is heavy, so not convenient to carry around."
4,Bible Reveiw,Good quality Bible. The print is pretty small however the rest of the Bible is just as advertised.
4,Comparative Study expands biblical understanding,This book is very helpful in quickly looking at various biblical translation when studing a concept or scripture. It is a must have for anyone looking to do inductive style bible study.
5,Excellent study tool for the accomplished theologian and the upstart.,This Bible is an excellent study tool to rightly divide the word of God. The side by side format of the four major translations makes reading and studying pleasant.
4,"Useful, but big and heavy","It's great having these four translations in one book. It's definitely for desktop use only, much too big and heavy for casual reading. Since it's already so big, it'd be nice if they'd included full footnotes for all four translations, and it's hard to figure out how they chose the few footnotes they did include. I'm not sorry I bought it, but I don't use it a lot because of its size."
4,Four in One,I bought one each for my husband and for a new (ESL) christian.It is a great way to compare 4 various versions in a well presented double-page spread especially for a new-comer who hasn't developed a translation preference or someone really interested in gleaning meaning from words.I think I'd prefer the Parallel Bible with the NLT instead of the AMP.What would be fantastic is a design-a-comparative-bible option where you choose which versions are compiled!I personally don't get anything out of the KJV and the NASB.I would drop one version in favour of a concordance or notes.All-in-all good value for money if you want 4 bibles.
5,Best season so far!,"I really enjoyed the second season with Ashley Spurlin, and George Reinas! My fav contestant was Ashley Spurlin! Ignore the drama, and enjoy the shooting competitions! I def. Will keep watching season 2! Very fun and exciting to watch, and learned a few things! Keep shooting!"
4,Good purchase,"Top Shot is one of my favorite shows. 16 professional and amateur marksmen compete in challenges using a variety of weapons including bow and arrows, rifles, pistols, and hatchets. The inaugural season was good and gained the interest of the military audience. Season 2 features many Armed Forces veterans in the competition. Since a reality competition retains much of its draw in the twists, turns, and surprises buy the season on Instant Video rather than collect a series of discs to store somewhere."
4,"wonderful, safe, and warm","We received this blanket sleep sack as a gift for our third child, and are now using it with our fourth. I'm quite paranoid about SIDS but am also very concerned with my baby getting cold at night without a blanket, so this is the perfect solution. I dress my son in a regular weight long sleeve sleeper and socks, then zip him up in this sleep sack. This way, I don't have to put a potentially dangerous blanket in the crib. He stays warm and comfy, and we both sleep better because of it. The only caveat I can see with it is that the shoulder velcro is very strong stuff--i'm sure it needs to be, for the product to stay on a wiggly baby--but if you're trying to put it onto an already sleeping baby or change a diaper in the middle of the night, good luck doing so without waking the baby! The velcro is VERY loud when you undo it. Other than that, this product is worth every penny for the peace of mind it gives you. After all, what's worth more than your baby's safety?"
1,velcro on shoulders!,"I bought this for my daughter because she needed larger sleep sacks and I like the zip around feature. They are great and soft, they are also long enough for a growing baby. However, one morning my daughter woke up with a bloody cheek. It took a while to realize that the scratches on her face were from the velcro on the shoulder straps. I stopped using these sleep sacks that day and bought new ones with snaps at the shoulders. There is a small warning on the tag that says to not put the velcro closure near your baby's face because it could scratch. How can you not put your baby's shoulder near her face?? I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone. I would recommend saving your money on this product and buying a better sleep sack without velcro closures."
2,Velcro tabs a pain! :(,"I love the concepts of sleepsacks- and our son is very cozy in them. The Kiddopatamus brand is usually reliable- we couldn't have done w/o their swaddlers for his first 4 months. However, the design of this product is flawed- it was a good idea in theory to have a zip around sleepsack so could put a sleepy baby in it without having to deal with putting their arms through holes like the Halo sack, BUT the velcro tabs are horrible! They are at a level where they scratched my son's cheeks/chin whenever he'd sleep with his head turned to one side. I tried attaching them loosely and snugly to see if it was just the level where I had velcroed them in place- but no- it's definitely a design flaw. We stopped using this sack and purchased several of the Halo sleepsacks- spend the few extra bucks and save yourself the pain!"
4,Better design than Halo,"We like this beddiebye design better than halo's sleepsack because it is easy to get baby in and out of sack and even change diapers without maneuvering the infant. Often baby is asleep when I put him into sleepsack. I just unzip the sack, lay it flat in crib, place sleeping baby on it and than just zip around the edge and velcro top in place. It is even easier than it sounds! My only complaint is the material could be more natural like cotton or flannel."
1,Very disappointing,I am a huge fan of Kiddopotamus products but this one failed to impress. The concept is excellent but there is a design flaw - the velcro strips at the shoulders scratched my son's cheaks near his jaw when he turned his head. Even when the greatest care was taken to ensure the velcro was fastened tightly - he'd still wake up with little scratches. Very disappointing. We have since thrown this sleep sack out and purchased the Kiddopotamus sleepsack with sleeves and no velcro (which we love and I'd highly recommend).
3,Almost perfect,"I purchased this sleeveless sleeper to have a cooler option for my baby than the version with sleeves. The velcro on her shoulder scratches her cheek unless I place the closure off-centered. This hasn't stopped me from using it, just be aware that is can cause a slight abrasion on your child's cheek.Also I don't recommend this for very cold climates (like mine). It's a nice fleece, but doesn't hold much warmth."
4,Great sleepsack! Wish it had snaps,"I got this for my almost seven month old, 19 lbs, 28"" if that helps anybody with sizing questions. It's a little big but isn't so big that it could cover her head or her arms could slip out of the armholes. I'm glad she can grow into it. There are Velcro fasteners at the shoulders and over the zipper tab. I wish there were snaps instead. I feel like with snaps you could get the same result, but without the noise of the Velcro. To do a diaper change with the sack on, I slide my fingers under the Velcro tab and pull down the zipper when I don't want to mess with the Velcro."
4,Warm and snuggly,"Love this, I bought the sleeved version and this one. So when its a bit warmer, or he has a sweater on, I put this one on. It super warm and soft, great size with room to grow. Easy to put on. But...the velcro straps are right by the ear on the shoulder, so when you take it off, its REALLY loud, not something he wants to hear after waking up."
4,Excellent Sleep Bag,This sleep bag is excellent; the Velcro shoulder traps and the zip around zipper make it very easy to put on. My daughter sleeps in it every night. The only downside is that she tends to push hard against the zipper at times and has broken one in the past (I had to buy a replacement). Highly recommend it.
2,Try with Baby First,There are so many sacks to choose from so I bought this because it was inexpensive. My son is in 6 month clothing so I bought a larger size. The neck was too big and the velcro - in order to be secure - are too loud when they need to be undone. I will be returning this and probably purchasing the Halo version - mostly due to the velcro being so loud.
5,Eased my mind!,"As a new mother, I worried so much about my son sleeping safely and keeping warm without a blanket. This wearable blanket was the answer. I finally got some sleep when I was able to stop worrying. Love this!"
2,scratchy velcro,"I purchased this sleep sack because I liked the idea of the zip around the bottom, and I still do. the sleep sack unzips all the way around which means you can lay it down and zip a sleeping baby into it easily which has worked really well for us.One BIG negative is the hard scratchy velcro on the shoulder tabs. Although I am always very careful to cover the hard velcro when I do it up, my daughter has a habit of twisting her head all the way to one side and she has woken up with very angry looking scratch marks several time, once even in the middle of the night and it really was very red and scratched.The sleep sack is well designed with the zipper, but I am not fond of the velcro and plan to remove it and add snaps before I use this one again.I'm giving it two stars for the zip around design, it loses the rest because of the velcro."
5,Great resource,This little book contains numerous and succinct suggestions on how I can approach and live life--both in the daily here-and-now and the more far-reaching time frames. Its free form can take you in directions you may not expect.I particularly like how it is practical yet philosophical and can even cause deep reflective thinking. It is also a great resource for quotations and presentations.
4,a good hardcore band?,"What is this? A real hardcore band... and they are good? This band is what keeps good hardcore still going - just straight forward hardcore with no crap thrown into it. Pissed off, fast, and furious. This cd is definately worth buying."
2,Stripy look,"I am a fan of Neurtogena products, but this one is not up to their usual standard. It is quite oily looking and you always have a feeling that something is layered on your face.As well as it you not rub it very well into your face you have stripes here and there, not the look I was going for. Very disappointed."
2,not what I had hoped for,"I don't like to wear any makeup and was hoping that this would just feel like a moisturizer going on. But it does not, it feels like make up and so I used it once or twice and that was about it. It does seem to cover okay but to be honest, I'm a bad judge at that, since I don't use makeup. But if you're looking for a moisturizer feel, keep on looking. It's not this one."
4,Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30,"It was nice to find a moisturizer with 30 SPF. I think it provides good sun protection, but I feel like I need to put more moisturizer under it as my skin still feels dry if I just use it."
2,Overpriced,"I paid $18--including shipping--for this tiny, tiny, little bottle of moisturizer in a box way too big for it (and it didn't arrive quickly, either). It needs to be rubbed in and blended really well to avoid leaving the dreaded ""foundation line."" I ended up liking it after a lot of trial and error, but I don't think I'll be buying it again. Not worth the cost."
4,a touch more color would be nice,"I truly love this product, which is why I have it on auto delivery ;) I do not wear foundation and this is perfect for giving a little color to my face without feeling like my skin can't breath. The ONLY thing I would change, is a tad more tint in the product. If you are like me and do not like to wear foundation because of the way it makes your skin feel (like if you smile too hard, your skin might crack) this is perfect for you!"
2,Not worth buying,"This bottle is not even 2 ounces and it costs more than $11! What a rip off. It doesn't work any better than other moisturizers, in fact I prefer the texture of other moisturizers and this one also has an odd smell. You can buy Olay or even the generic brand moisturizers with SPF and they have the same ingredients and work great. I will not be buying this again."
3,its ok?,i got this and a bunch of other figures for my boys 4 and 8 for christmass quite fun to it is a fun toybut it broke after a wile. i dont know much to say about this its a fun toy
1,Not for the stars,"As its sister copy ""Just what the doctor ordered"" the selection is poor and not relevant, considering all the extraordinary ads of the 40' and the 50'."
2,"Nice pictures, but.....","Not a book I can recommend. Though it is filled with nice photographs of bread with interesting-sounding flavors and combinations of ingredients, many of the recipes just don't work for one reason or another. Anyone seriously interested in baking should consider The Bread Baker's Apprentice by Peter Reinhart. This book also has great photos of interesting breads, and they all work flawlessly."
4,Essential,"If the TV coverage is going to be all fluff and you need to know some vital stats about the last time a Frenchman won a speed skating gold medal, where are you going to turn. Well here of course!"
1,Shoe labeled incorrectly,This is supposed to be a steel-toe work shoe.The one I received was not a steel-toe.The material of the shoe is suede and fake fur which for me does not make a good factory work shoe.Would not recommened unless you have a office job which requires a work shoe.Did not even try on so can't comment on the comfort level.
5,Inspirational and informative,"Michael Collopy's Architect's of Peace focuses on 75 individuals who can be credited with being change makers during their lifetimes pursuing a better world for all. The stunning portraits created by Mr. Collopy together with each person's statements regarding peace, thoughts on civilization's problems and solutions, appearing side by side, become at once a clarion call and a meditation to the reader. I was transfixed by the individuals' words and Mr. Collopy's riveting images. They are proof that all individuals have the power to make change happen. Each of us need only start."
5,It could happen...,"All About Me, a story with a surprise inside...at least I was surprised. Amidst a `fantastical' party lifestyle, Tamara Hightower was snapped into a reality with the return of her past. Her real past not one made up...like her life.Realistically portrayed, Natalie Darden tells a story that is easy for many to relate to, although the time, place and people are unique to this work of fiction. At times, yes, I think some of Tamara's actions are so shocking that one might call them vulgar or obscene however, I don't think the book was written to say that all single black woman would act like her and are vulgar, obscene and or unable to handle responsibility. I think what happened in Tamara's life could happen to any woman of any color and any woman of any color, unprepared for it as Tamara was, could act as Tamara did. The partying could have taken place in a country bar as easily as a hip-hop bar. This book was written well, and true to the genre."
1,Disappointed,"This book is a difficult read for any self respecting African American. It is divisive, vulgar, and it has a barrage of negative stereotypes. It is difficult to connect with the story line as well. I expected it to be an interesting book but after chapter two my interest faded. I wish I could get my money back, but unfortunately, I purchased it directly from the author. My advice is to place this book in a receptacle where trash belongs. Would I recommend this book? No, it was very disappointing!"
5,"I Rave for ""Mage...""!!!","This has been the best book I have read in a long time! The reader is instantly swept into the story line and these characters will remain in your heart forever. I strongly encourage everyone with a love of great books to read ""Mage Confusion.""A really good book is often thought of as buried treasure, and Mrs. McMorrow has struck gold! Can't wait for books 2 & 3!!!!"
5,Mage Confusion,"I hate to admit this but it has been years since I have been interested enough in a book to get past the first chapter. This book not only got me through the first chapter but I had the book done in two and a half days. For most that may not seem like much but if you had my schedule.....I honestly think this book along with the other two to come would make a great motion picture. You can picture so well in your mind the characters, events, places, ect. like you were there. I was so surprised to find that everything I thought was going to happen was wrong which is the kind of book people like to read. Mrs. McMorrow has done a wonderful job on her first book and I'm sure the sequels will be even better. Kudos to her and I hope more people will read this book and I'm so excited about getting the next installment. Thanks Mrs. McMorrow for a great book!!!!!"
3,Kind of like an MRE desert,"These bars are OK but not fantastic. They are very low in moisture and have a MRE taste to them. Personally, I found them to have more of a gingerbread taste then an almond taste. I would have liked more nuts and some fruit in the otherwise dry cake."
1,"puros mitos y mentiras, la mayor parte dd los partisanos aparecieron en los ultimos dias de la guerra.","esos valientes partisanos que aparecen en muchos libros, son aquellos mismos que vitoreaban a las tropas invasoras al marchar por sus pueblos y ciudaddes,cuando fue segura la derrota de alemania, se conviertieron en heroes de ultima hora..."
1,Padded creeper,"I thought this fold up creeper maybe had some little wheels underneath to allow you to roll under and out from under a car, but that's not the case. This is nothing more than a fold up pad that you can lay on. It's about an inch thick. It does not make sliding in and out easier, in fact it makes it harder because the pad sticks to the concrete or the asfault. A peice of thick cardboard works better than this does I think. This is basically not a creeper in the usual sense of the word. It would work great as a seating pad for two poeple at ball games or any other type of bleacher seating where your bottom might need padding."
5,FrAcTuReD FaIrY tAlE's BoOk Is GrEaT!,"We all know the story of the Princess and the Pea, right? Well, this musical and its music book give it some well needed humor! Origianlly starring Carol Burnett, MATTRESS went on to make 2 TV movies and eventually star Ms. Sarah Jessica Parker, a now Emmy award winning actress. MATTRESS entered my life 12 months ago, and it is still here! For me, MATTRESS seems to have started my acting career. Buy this book if you need to learn songs for a role, or if you just want to add it to your Broadway collection!"
3,Missing songs.,"Our copy was well-used and missing some of the songs from the play. Husband was grateful to have it, anyway."
1,This needed more help,I bout this because I like fishing it was very boring to was couple of men an the boat and you can't fast-forward or rewind the DVD don't waste your money look elsewhere
1,Tore apart in less than a month,"I bought this for my weimaraner to sleep in while staying with my sister. He's not a destructive dog (doesn't chew or scratch), and within a month the bottom seam was completely torn, apparently just from him leaning/laying on it. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Okay to Watch - Needs to be Restored/Remastered,"This was a DVD set I really wanted so bought it suspecting it has not been restored/remastered and it certainly has not - while I am only up to the third of the 11 DVDs in this set I can say that it is ok to watch and at times I feel some of the footage looks fairly good but overall it suffers from having not been restored/remastered and I also found that the video can be a little jittery at times - it's not the worst I've seen in these old 50s/60s DVDs that have not been restored/remastered but hey Timeless Video, this one would really benefit from being digitally restored/remastered!"
1,This video is lame,"This is dancing for retards. It took them over 30 minutes to teach 3 steps. You end up spending an hour and only learn 6 steps total. Don't waste your money on this video. It is helpful to get started, but that's about it. Josie's Dance Hot Salsa is much better for salsa, there is not much out there for mambo."
3,Read all of the reviews for this product,"The other reviewers have it right. There are few good Mambo dance-instruction videos out there and this one barely scratches the surface -- especially if you know what you are doing on the dance floor. Nevertheless it is useful in communicating a very basic knowledge of this dance. The DVD uses a stay-in-place Basic Step for much instruction; later it shows the simple Side-Step Basic and the Progressive (traveling) Basic as variations. The Cross-Body Turn is nicely executed because the instructors are energetic and poised. There is also the Crossover Break with Walkaround Turn, Twirls for the Lady, Twirls for the Man, Twirls for both of them and the Challenge Position among the details demonstrated. There is a track about ""dirty dancing"" styling that makes you want to search Youtube for the choreographed originals. I enjoyed watching the instructional couple dance."
5,How one man resolves a horrible choice.,"This is the most humane story I have read regarding the violence, fear, and unwavering love of placeand community that so largely defines Northern Island in the last third of this century. Ten years ago I chose this book off the shelf, without knowing anything about it or the author. I read the book on a Saturday and was so amazed by it I re-read it again the next day. A week later I read it again and have read it perhaps 10 times over the years. The story of a grandfather faced to make a terrible decision is a simple plot but a complex question. And the dual love of family and Place enrich this story of how compassion overrides criminality. I would also recommend anything else written by Benedict Kiely, for his ability to Put The Reader In Northern Ireland."
4,4550 paint shaker,purchased this shaker for our paint dept. all is going well. good prodduct for the money. I would recomend to others....Kurt
4,Not hot but not bad,"Like another reviewer here, I found this book, which was unknown to me beforehand, in a used book store. Unlike another reviewer here, I liked it. It definitely has a '70s social Sci-Fi feel to it and it is an easy read. I think it poses a good question and that is, if you have the solution to mankind's problem (in the case of this novel, extreme pollution) should you give it up? I believe the answer is yes, which makes the protagonist in this novel interesting as he believes the answer is no."
3,Gets the Job Done,"It's poker. Nothing too complicated. Gameplay is fast enough to where I don't hate it, but it's nothing too exciting."
1,Complete Disappointment,"This book is a complete disappointment. The author attacks teachers on every level, including an opening sentence attacking the profession because a number of teachers at a teachers' covention are overwieght. The book is one sided and provides no sense of balance or research of any academic weight.To understand Amercia's schools, Savage Inequalities by Jonathon Kozol or Hard Truths by Barbara Tye provide a reasonable understanding of what ios wrong with our schools."
1,A Shoddy Stab at the Guts of our American System,"Peter Brimelow wants to tear up the foundations of American, the building blocks of America, the PUBLIC SCHOOLS. This right wing drivel lacks clarity and is horribly biased against our children and public schools. Public schools are the great equalizer of our society, allowing ALL children the right to an education.Peter comes across as unfair. He leaves out facts that make our schools look great.Everyone in the world wants an American education. Why is that if our schools are so poor? Our schools are overrun with applications from other countries, people paying to send their kids to our public schools instead of attending their private schools.The teacher's ""unions"" are the first to support teacher testing and support strong qualifications for teachers. Brimelow uses half truths to constantly support his message."
1,it is time someone insert some facts into this discussion,"I have worked at both public and private schools. The people working at the public schools were more competent all the way around. Public schools are not socialist. This is simply right wing giberish and diddle-ee-doo.Oh, upon further review, the best engineering college in Illinois is public."
1,Right-wing pap,"This screed isn't worth the time or money. Brimelow is clearly shilling for the wealthy, right-wing foundations and business people (The Bradley Foundation, John Walton, Ted Forstmann) who will do ANYTHING to get their hands on a share of the public education ""industry,"" which [generates billions of dollars]. If unions are the problem, how would Brimelow explain that student achievement in states where teachers are unionized is far higher than in those states where they are not? Save your money."
1,Professional attack hacks should not be taken seriously.,"If you research Mr. Brimelow even just a little, you won't bother with this hater screed. As to the ""spotlighted"" review on what teachers might want to know about public schools before they take jobs, such can be illustrated far more constructively in a thousand other books, including ""Educating Esme"" and ""Trust In Schools."""
5,Buy these shoes,Great product for a great price. In the stores these are pretty expensive but of high quality. Buy them online to save a bundle.
3,Great for intermediate/advanced yogis...,"This is a great DVD! I have to agree with the previous reviewers, this is not for beginners typically. With that being said, a group of 14 of us of different yoga levels did this during our break today (some of us being brand new to yoga, while others of us are quite advanced) and we all kept up just fine. Denise does do crow pose which is highly advanced (as a previous reviewer noted) but also the others on the DVD show the modifications. This is a challenge but one you find yourself wanting to work toward accomplishing without challenge! GREAT for the price!"
5,Excellent Workout,"Despite any complaints listed - it says Yoga Burn - which means her goal is fat burning...not teaching all the ins and outs of yoga. I have Yoga Buns and Fat Blasting Yoga...I love them all and am quite pleased with the results. And now she has a feature where you can turn her talking off. If you want quality instruction, I suggest you not be cheap and pay for a class instead of a dvd...as with any type of learning, it is easiest when you have a person who can coach/correct and answer questions."
2,"Yoga, not really.... to fast to get into poses. Definitely not for beginers!","I like many have a lot of Denise Austins tapes and though I typically find her babble annoying, her workouts are usually terrific. I was excited to get a new Yoga DVD and get started. What a disappointment. I have been doing Yoga for 4 years and as a fitness instructor/personal trainer I am pretty confidant in the poses and breath involved. I could barely keep up with her transitions back and forth between moves she went so fast. You had no time to actually get into a pose before she was on to the next. Yoga is holding a pose for at least a few seconds before moving, this definetly does not qualify.As with other reviews I to had a hard time seeing what she was doing and she very rarely named the pose you were moving into or cued it. I'll have to watch again, but I think she actually miss named one or two poses when she did name them.Maybe Denise needs to stick with the cardio workouts where she is truly great."
4,A DEFINITE CHALLENGE,"Since I have only viewed and practiced the segments once this is my initial response. I certainly was pleased by the challenge and the flow of the poses. My only objection is the lack of instruction on breathing. She didn't cue as much as I would have enjoyed. Yet, overall, this is a keeper for my fitness regime.If anyone is interested in an all level yoga workout DVD/VHS, it would be Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga with Sarah Ivanhoe who gives excellent breathing instruction as well as prompts for poses."
4,Love it!!,A great yoga workout. I have never done yoga before and was a little hesitant that I would get bored. But this video is great. You are doing yoga stretches and constantly moving as well. I would really recommend to try this video is your interested in trying yoga.
5,Another good vid,"Got this for Mom as a Christmas gift. She loves splitting workouts between two of Denise's programs. From what I've heard, she has yet to tire of the regime laid out.Shipping was expedient, even for standard. Thank you."
4,Well rounded video,A well-rounded video. Not hard core yoga but a good mix of poses and exercises! I use it on days in between my harder workout days.
3,Another Denise DVD,"Denise Austin has put out a plethora of DVD's which are purpose-made for the particular subject. You would think that I prefer that to excerpts from the regular show itself. They do them 'fresh' because they are incredibly inexpensive to make. I would prefer even LESS expensive clips from her show. The reason being is that her regular show had a certain spontaneity, a variety of locations, outfits, themes, etc. Her DVD's are so purposeful that anyone on earth could make them. We want Denise Austin and her spunky demeanor. Her regular show is funnier, sexier, and more personal..."
4,this is my first yoga dvd..,yes the cueing is a lil frustrating at first and she does move quickly but i do feel like i've worked out. Good variety and you dont get bored. I dont regret buying this at all.
5,Great Work Out,"I bought this DVD after I had been doing the Denise Austin Extra Lite Yoga video for a while. I love the workout, in just a few weeks I can see more defination in my body, and I feel great. I am glad that I had been doing some yoga before the purchase of this dvd because this really stepped it up a notch."
1,Out of Cue,"Strongly agree & beautifully stated by reviewer Bowers. Denise Austin's cues were completely out of sequence and at times I didn't know what was going on or what to do next. I was wondering does she think I have eyes like a spider that I can see the TV while facing down on the floor mat. She also doesn't give you sufficent time to get into the yoga poses. Moves to quickly to enjoy yoga. I was extremely upset and ready to ditch the DVD. I thought yoga is suppose to be calming but not with Denise Austin. Oh and lets not forget her voice - annoying. I just started Yoga a year ago and watch Steve Ross on Oxygen at 6:00 am, and also brought Ellen Barrett super slimdown crunch: Pilates Yoga Blend and I can say now they know how to cue. I had purchased a Denise Austin video years ago and it was the same issue - her cueing, out of sequence or never called out. I was hoping she had taken the time to read her viewer comments and made some changes to her workouts. Guess not."
5,my favorite workout,This is my favorite workout. I feel great after burning calories while stretching. Denise Austin is so nice.
3,denise austin yoga burn,I enjoyed the video however i think she could go a little slower and do the motions more than once on the cool down. It seems too rushed.
2,Should have known better,I've tried Denise Austin's DVDs before and have always found them fast paced and advanced there is no beginner for her. She moves quite quickly and doesn't always cue what she's wanting you to do. She's great for someone who is very in shape and used to the quick. But she advertises this for beginner to intermediate and that is very misleading. The cooldown was more my pace and reminded me of correct position in some of the moves that I haven't used in a while.I'll come back to this once I've gotten back in to shape. For now I've ordered a Suzanne Deason DVD to help me. She's more instructive and allows you to learn the poses before rushing you throught to something else.
3,Another satisfying story,"Although this isn't my favorite Susanna Kearsley story, it is one of the best. Vivid place descriptions, well developed characters, and just enough fantasy to make it fun."
5,"Even after, it helped","I bought this for my mother some years ago. She died this May, never having filled it out. However, right afterwards, I was able to put in information that allowed me to organize her affairs because the booklet guided me through many of the steps I had to deal with. While I would not suggest waiting until a loved ones dies to use this, it is a simple, easy to fill out booklet that shouldn't take anyone more than a week or so to organize. And I am going to make certain my brother, sister, and our spouses all have copies of this or similar books to make it much easier on those who remain."
5,Truly making things easy,Book came in perfect condition and on a timely basis. My dad is thankful to have something to guide him while putting his things in order.
1,Oakenfold?,"Don't bother if you are an old school Oakenfold fan (pre Bunnka). It's clear that Paul's production work is no longer in realm of progressive electronic music. This is a pop culture ""techno"" album for teenagers."
3,Very uneven effort,"""Faster Kill Pussycat"" - ready-made dance club hit, I like it and yet... it just seems too formulaic, anyone could have put this out.""Amsterdam"" - Oakenfold owes The KLF a royalty check for this one. Totally rips off ""What Time Is Love?"" even if he didn't mean to.""Switch On"" - coming to a car commercial (Scion?) near you soon. Again, I like it but...""Set It Off"" - total friggin waste of Grandmaster Flash's talent. HUGE disappointment. Like calling on Bono and then using him for background vocals only."
2,Transition?,"I think that this is not what I am used to from Paul. I have followed his music for quite some time and this is a huge departure from his gentle, relaxing tracks that I love so much. More House-ish, in a cheap c.d. kinda way. My opinion. I bought and I would part with it easy. I long for transport!"
1,Still listening to Oakie?? You are missing out on OTHER good talent..,"Um..So, if you bought this and think it should be on the top 10 or 100 list for Billboard, then great, you are the audience that he is targeting. And, the audience he has sold out his profession too. I am not saying that the production is mediocre, because it is flawless, but he shunned his craft a long time ago, and for that, those who know him through the 8 hour live sets he used to spin, feel that it is time to move on.I am sorry, I lost respect when I saw him in Chicago at the Congress, and he only played an hour and a half, and albums like 'Bunkka' and 'A Lively Mind' did that to him."
5,Absoluly Wonderful! A great investment,This album is absolutely wonderful. If you are a lover of Benny Benassi This album is for. The it's well organized and pulled together. This is his best by far album. What people probably don't like about this is that it's electronic house and not trance. It's defiantly a step in a new direction for him. And I feel it's a great change for the better.All of the tracks are really put together well. And It sounds awesome! A great buy if you like strong bass and beats and smooth flowing house.
1,Skip This One,"What is going on with this guy these days? This CD is really bubble gum, and not the familiar Oakenfold we have come to love over the years. Want a good one? Try Creamfields or Great Wall."
5,Oakenfold Isn't Afraid To Take Chances! This Jams!,"I've been a long time Oakenfold listener, along with many other trance / techno / house DJ artists and I appreciate the bold chances taken with the music. This album is truly wonderful and anyone who gives it 1 star obviously doesn't truly respect this genre of music.Good job, Paul! I'm very happy with my purchase."
2,A LAME MIND....,"It's been hit-and-miss with Oakey, lately. I hope he reads reviews because he needs to get back on the mark. I almost bought this album without reservation until I listened to the clips on Amazon and read the reviews. Good thing I didn't; it would be collecting dust by now.I heard Faster Kill Pussycat on XM radio and it was awesome. However, I didn't realize it was the Nat Monday mixed version that XM was playing, and not the pathetic standard version on this album. If you want the Nat Monday version, buy the Faster Kill Pussycat single available on Amazon for under $8. It has several versions of that song mixed. Otherwise, I advise skipping A Lively Mind completely, especially if you're more into Oakenfold classics like Tranceport, Another World and Creamfields (my favorites). And I thought The Club was bad..."
2,Not a Trance Record,"I was so disappointed by this album. I've relied on Paul Oakenfold for good trance since the early days but this is not it. It is just more of the same stuff he did on Bunka -- only not as good. If you like trance music, do yourself a favor and try listening to DJ Tiesto instead of this album."
2,Full size is NOT sized for a full size bed,"This product would be excellent but runs fully 4"" too narrow and 3"" too short. This creates an aprox. 2"" lip around the entire matress. Very odd. This short coming disturbs the experience substantially. The laminated back works well. Be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine."
5,Great mix - cheap price,"You get five CD's with a great mix of music. I bought it more for bellydance than for ""chilling out"". Heard quite a few on Pandora and had to get it.There are middle-eastern sounds as well as jazz and mellow stuff."
4,Easy to Make Recipes,"I received this book as a gift. I was new at feeding my infant ""finger foods"" and I was so confused on what to feed and what not to feed. The recipes are divided in sections according to age. At the beginning of each section, there is a menu plan and some tips on feeding. The recipes are not only good for the whole family but they don't cost alot to make."
3,Useful but a outdated,"The book is outdated in that it refers to the four basic food groups (pyramid food groups have been around a long time now) and shows pictures in each recipe for which food groups are included. I did not notice that the copyright date was old. And, I think it had a couple of suggestions for feeding things to little ones that I wouldn't follow (but every mom makes those decisions on their own anyway). I almost returned it but since I really don't know anything about cooking (I had to read directions to make rice) I did find some useful information. And, for moms who want to do the more healthy thing for example there is a recipe for healthy yogurt instead of buying yogurt with sugar in it.This is the kind of thing I found helpful. There are some really good looking recipes for a beginner cook like me."
3,Informative Guide to Nutrition,"This book has a lot of helpful information regarding infant and toddler feeding. I tried many of the recipes and found that they were pretty tasty, if I added a little salt! NO sugar and NO salt in a diet are good goals to strive for but perhaps a bit unrealistic. Nevertheless the book is a useful tool if you are truly interested in getting you kids off to a healthy start nutrition-wise."
5,Super Great Cookbokk,I just love this cookbook! Its super informative and the recipes great! I love that the none babies in the house can enjoy the food as much as the baby. I also loved learning about incorporating spices into baby's diet. The california chicken with avacado is great.
1,Can't add,"Lots of options, pretty easy to use (but I have used another similar program so I had a head start)but it thinks you can put a 36"" cabinet, a 30"" oven & a 30"" refridgerator in a 7' 9"" space. My math says 36+30+30 = 8 feet. This is so deceptive as to make the program worse than useless!! The 3-D renerdering is pretty bad too. I'm asking for my money back."
1,What a ripoff!!!!!,"Wanted a software program to help design my kitchen. This software was not the latest, therefore, the price reflected that. Fine print says to make sure your computer is compatible with the software as it is not returnable. I made sure it was compatible based on what the description said on the website. Unfortunately it was NOT compatible. Tried several times unsuccessfully. Even called tech support. They couldn't help me either. Since I can't return it I am throwing it away. At least I didn't spend a fortune on it. Sad when you can't even believe the claim that it will be compatible when they say it will be. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
2,Pretty useless,"Very difficult even to get started. I gave up trying to set up a simple room plan using the wizard after half a dozen attempts, then drew the walls manually. It defaulted to the exterior dimensions (i.e. including a random wall thickness) so all my measurements were off. Then found I had to add a floor (which it doesn't default to the room size!).I was designing a bathroom and it does not include square or rectangular shower enclosures as options, nor is it possible to put in glass partitions.Pretty hopeless really. Glad I only paid for a month's subscription."
5,For School,"This software was just what I needed for my design class. It helped so much, my grade wouldn't have been as good without it(A)."
2,Really?...,"I used this at a much earlier version and it worked better than the latest one. Our house burned down so I bought it again to create a new plan. Can't believe I wasted my money on this junk. There are so many bugs and convolutions that I spend more time trying to get it to work right than I do designing. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when you are working on one floor, adding walls, doors and fixtures it mostly works. Anything beyond that and you better do some meditation 'cause your gonna get pissed."
2,Poor design and quality.,"I'll just ADD to the other reviews, but I must complain about the harness buckles.1. Safety harness/belt buckles - my wife's finger was bleeding recently - that's how hard they are. Extremely hard to open and close.2. Reclining back rest. There are three positions and you need to pull up a locking handle behind the back rest, then recline. Almost impossible to adjust - it gets stuck, you need to use force, it then ""snaps"" into the new position. Don't even try to change the angle with baby in the seat - you may hurt the baby when it snaps.3. The removable plastic food tray. It arrived slightly deformed. It's not completely flat, so it wobbles in its base and makes noise.4. Static. Because the chair is entirely made of hollow plastic parts - it's like a static dust and hair magnet."
3,Ouch!,"As the other reviewer said, this thing looks cool, and we do get comments on it, which is fantastic, since it's sitting in the middle of our great room. The buckle is the problem. It is very stiff, and both my husband and I have received extremely painful blood blisters on our fingers where we've been pinched while fastening our little girl into place. We'll continue using it for now, but if it becomes a wrestling match trying to keep her hands away while we fasten her in, the chair will hit the curb - no telling what would happen to her tiny fingers in that horrible clasp!"
4,Japanese Samurai Horror Movie,"I enjoyed this video very much and passed it on to friends to enjoy, too. Sure wish you carried more like movies."
2,"Well, at least its entertaining","I love Jackie Chan, so it pains me to give this movie a mediocre at best review. There must be some contract with action stars that requires them to do a lame baby movie at least once in their carreer (I'm looking at you Vin Diesel). As to this one, its not per se a bad movie, the action is decent, but the story is fairly weak, following the usual, ""I'm so cool I don't need kids around, but wait I reluctantly have to take care of a kid, and after some time really like the kid and eventually must save it"" story. There are of course the standard poopy diaper and peeing in the face jokes one would expect as well. So why didn't I give it one star, well, the actors are pretty good, given what they have. And Jackie pulls off a few great action/comedy moments. So in all, the movie is not particularly great, but was watchable. Recomended if you're looking for another jackie chan film, or are really into cliche baby movies."
5,love it,"W&#466; ài n&#464;, chénglóng, n&#464; shì m&#283;ih&#462;o hé yàm&#462;xùn sh&#464;de t&#257; gèng róngyì gòum&#462;i n&#464; de diàny&#464;ng, bìng gàosu w&#466; de háizi, w&#466; ài g&#333;ngfu dehuà, w&#466; zuò zhèxi&#275; if you speak Mandarin awesome- you must see the original and read the sub titles it makes the movies better"
4,The 5 stars are because she is the best nobody can replace,"I wish I could give you a review, however I have been waiting for this book, since last year October. How can you put up a book for sale, when did you know you didn't have it? Or were you thinking the books were being delivered? I am very MAD, Cause I have ordered books from here before, and they have NEVER BEEN THIS LATE. Get to poking them publishers, and tell them to make people happy, especially me, A VERY FINE.AND LOVING FAN OF MISS C'ELINE. To me she is more than Life itself. A Goddess of Song and Beauty. Please get this book, so I can READ IT!!!!!!!!! Oh by the way, since its taking so long, it should be mine FREE!!!!!"
4,MASCARA,goes on nice with small brush-it is smaller and seems to help get the tiny lashes in the corners. lashes look nice-no prob with clumps or irritation. s/w difficult getting all off at night-tend to have raccoon eyes in the morning even though removed night before.
2,"Great mascara, so-so seller","I have been buying this mascara for years at my local drugstore; it's awesome. The small wand is the best.I gave ordering on Amazon a try; I ordered a black from Amazon directly and it arrived just fine. This brownish-black arrived in packaging that was faded and yellowed (read: old, or exposed to sunlight or heat). The mascara itself was dried and clumpy.Buy this mascara, just not from this Amazon seller."
2,First Timer,I bought this book for my first trip to San Francisco. It touched upon all the major tourist traps but the descriptions didn't go into enough detail. The writing was very dry and activities not geared enough to those using public transporation.
2,Too DRY!!,"I put this on right after taking a shower in the morning and it flakes off probably because my skin was a little dry. But it has daily moisterizer right? Also, the tint is very light, and does not do a good job of coverage. I was not expecting it to be heavy like a foundation, but Dove did a better job than Neutrogena on coverage part. Also, the tint was not shiny enough (lol, if too shiny then my skin look oily), so it makes my skin look flat, not radiant. Can't wait to finish this product so I can go back to Dove"
4,TRUE WRESTLING,"These are the wrestlers i grew up on...well some of them were the wrestlers i grew up on.I am 16 now and i grew up with Hulk Hogan,Sting,Ultimate Warrior,LOD,Bret Hart,Owen Hart and wrestlers like that.I think they should have put some more of the orginial WWF wrestlers in it.Other then that its a good game."
2,Almost Unplayable,"This game SUCKS!!! There is ONE good quality in this game and that is all the legends and after you choose your wrestler it's all downhill. The controls are terrible, the graphics are PS1 quality and there is only 5 unlockable characters and you unlock them all at once. This game is absoulutely unplayable. I recommend this game to hardcore wretling fans or someone who wants to spend $30-$50 on a game so crappy you can laugh at it and kick dirt in its face."
2,Not As Good As Others......,"Compared to some of the new SmackDown gamesthat are out- ""Here Comes The Pain""or ""SmackDown VS Raw"" ....this game is just plain boring.The selection of wrestlers is awesome,but it doesn't take long for the novelty towear off...and you're left playing a slow paced,repetitve game.Stick with the SMACKDOWN series...they are by farthe best WWE games out there!"
2,The truth about legends of wrestling,"I've been playing wrestling games since 1988's WWF Wrestlemania for NES and I've played damn near every game since then for all consoles. I know my wrestling games and this one sucks. Although this game has some improvments over the former legends of wrestling games, it's still way short on moves. Only three Strikes per player! Thats right only three strikes per player...1 2 3!!! Forget about doing an irish whip into the ropes because the person being whipped can get out of it everytime by press square and I mean everytime, attacking from outside the ring, forget that too because it never works. Last time I checked the year was 2004 going on 2005 ..and Akklaim is releasing crap like this? Sad but true.The roster is the only reason I bought this game and its the only reason I gave it two stars. The rosters is awesome!"
2,confused,"I got the game a few days ago, and I was wondering if the empty boxes on the character select screen were for hidden characters. If it is for hidden people can somebody tell me how to get themthanks"
2,No Legend Here,"I bought this game drooling at the idea that I could have The Ravishing One vs. Mr. Wonderful in a first blood match but the slow responsiveness of the controls and lack of replayability ruins this game. How could this truly be a legends game without Ric Flair, Arn & Ole Anderson, Magnum T.A.,Junkyard Dog and let us not forget The Total Package Lex Luger and the Midnight Express. This game is for hardcore fans who reminisce of the old-school days of the NWA and WWF. I think I may purchase WWE-HCTP. How bout this classic match for the next Legends title- Texas Boot Strap Match."
4,legends of wrestling showdown,this new legends of wrestling is a fun game it has better graphics more superstars and a its just all out better than the first two.the only thing it lacks is some other legends like shawn michaels and the undertaker they were legends and they fought in the time of bret hart and ultimate warrior
1,GOOD IDEA BAD PRODUCT,the idea of having all these legends is great..but acclaim really did a bad job..first game play is very slow..theres alot of gilnches..its not good..dont expect wwe smackdwon quality or gameplay...maybe THQ should make a game like this...rent this game but dont buy it...LOW and LOW2 were also bad games and i thought they wouldve improved this one but they didnt..i only give this game 1 star because the idea is good but the final product is bad
1,Filled with bugs and glitches that spoil the game.,"While the game boasts one of the greatest rosters ever put in a wrestling game, the bugs and glitches ruin this game. While Acclaim's idea was a good one, they deliver a game that feels more like an unfinished demo."
3,THE GAME OF GLITCHES,THIS GAME IS SO FUNNY I ALWAYS CRACK UP WITH THE GLITCHES.ONE TIME I WASDOING A MATCH BAM BAM BIGALOW VS. BAM BAM BIGALOW IN A STEAL CAGE MY COUSIN BRIAN WAS JUMPING UP IN THE AIR HE PICKED ME UP AND WE WENT THROUGHT THE ROOF WE SAW A PARKING LOT.THEN BRYAN WAS SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE AND THE MATCH WAS STILL ON.BRIAN WAS JUMPING ON PEOPLES HEADSIN THE AUDIENCE.I MEAN THE MATCH IS NOT CALLED JUMP ON PEOPLES HEADS ANDTHEN YOU WIN.
2,"GREAT ROSTER, poor game","I feel compelled to speak admirably of this game for its awesome roster. I only WISH that the more recent legends game by THQ, LEGENDS OF WRESTLEMANIA, had a roster this great. Because as far as I am concerned, Showdown has them all. Macho Man, Sid Vicious, Sting, DDP, Owen Hart, Nasty Boys, Steiner Bros, the list goes on. All of the above mentioned people are NOT IN the legends of wrestlemania game, though obviously some aren't in it for a reason. (Sting was never in WWE.)Unfortunately, the fun factor just doesn't exist. This game is really blande. I honestly enjoy legends of wrestling 2 more, gameplay wise, because of the special referee option, and it simply has a better fun factor. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the roster this one has.I wish there could be a modern next-gen game that had a roster like THIS, but had great gameplay. Unfortunately in the end its mostly style over substance in this genuine but failing effort of a game."
3,not bad but not great,"I have to say this time out they did alot better than the first one. Never played the 2nd one but I'm sure it sucked. The best part about this game is the classic matches. This game isn't for anybody looking for another smackdown. It's a pure 70's/80's type of match. Punches, kicks, head locks, and then power moves. This probably angers most people who were looking for the smackdown powerbombs, and 2 thousand moves. IF you don't like the old school stuff, I'd shy away from this one. Well worth a rent in that you can beat the game in a little under 2hrs."
2,Big Names that pack a waek punch,This game is full of some of the greatest wrestlers of all time. I was looking forward to its realease for some time. It of course is missing a few of the biggest names(like Ric Flair) but that is the least of this games problems. The game is not challenging on any level of difficulty and the career mode just plain sucks. This game is worth buying only if you love the old school names and there look but if you are looking for a game fun to play for the long term this is not the game for you.
1,THQ STILL IS THE CHAMP,"I tried to like this game but no dice. I kept on comparing it to the much better SmackDowntitle by THQ.The controls were lame, the wrestlers seem to be punching rather then wrestling.During a match After about the 4th or 5th bunch they bleed already. The wrestler seem smallcompared to SmackDown.Look I have been a wrestling fan for about 20 years now andThis game really disappointed me. The reason I gave any stars is because of the roster ofWrestlers it has.My advice save the $$ for SmackDown vs Raw by THQ the real authorityon wrestling games."
3,"Not as Good as ""Happiest Millionaire""","Sadly, this movie wasn't as delightful for me as its predecessor, ""The Happiest Millionaire"" (which has the same two leads). Where Millionaire came together in a sparkling, fun, hummable package, ""Family Band"" has a hard time getting off the ground. It's music isn't as memorable as ""Millionaire"", and the characters aren't much developed, I found it hard to care about them. Also, ""Family Band"" has some serious, darker moments. For example, the overfocus of everyone on politics, and defending political opinions to the point of physical blows is not the stuff of happy fare, at least not for me. Toss in Grandpa's castigation by his son Carver, and Grandpa's immature response, as well as Alice's prejudicial treatment by the townspeople... and you get stuff that can be emotionally confusing for a musical.So, to sum up, for the best Disney has to offer in costumes, toe-tapping music, romance, good cheer and memorable characters, I'd stick with ""Happiest Millionaire."""
1,Four Star movie -- one star DVD,"A disappointing release from Disney Home Video of a charming film with great stars and wonderful Sherman Brothers' music. The extras are nice: a short ""making of"" documentary and optional audio commentary. Why the one star? A poor pan-and-scan release with below par video quality are truly unacceptable in today's DVD market. It would be better for the Disney Company to slow down its release sechedule and take the time to create quality releases of these older title that appeal to ""grown up"" Disney fans and film students."
5,movie,"So glad you carry such old movies on Dvd...and such a great reasonable price! My family loves them... this was such a fun movie, my kids grew up with it.. had to order some for their families to enjoy now!"
2,No story line,"This movie did not have much of a plot. I know it was made to be a musical, but most musicals have more of a plot than this one. I enjoyed watching Walter Brennan and Buddy Ebsen, two classic actors."
1,Not good for larger car seats,"We have a convertible car seat that doesn't have a canopy to protect our newborn from the sun so I bought this shade, hoping it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it didn't. We installed the canopy on our car seat, which is rear-facing right now due to our baby's small size, and it only provided a little bit of protection. The sun was still shining right in his face. Maybe it works on the smaller infant car seats but it didn't work for us. :-("
2,Doesn't work as advertized,"I am a bit dissapointed. I bought this to protect my 4 month old from the sun. Having a 3-stage car seat, it is difficult to find a canopy to attach. It doesn't work very well for rear-facing since the top is shaped like a duck-bill. Fingers crossed that it works better when I switch her to forward facing. It does keep the sun off her from the side windows, and it was easy to connect to the car seat."
1,fell apart while in use,"After about 6 months in use it just fell apart. Very cheap and substandard welds. If you can your best bet (if you are on a budget like me) is to get a used OEM unit in good condition. That is what I ended up doing and it is working great. It seems you can't get a good aftermarket mount for these Saturns. The top engine aftermarket mounts are equally disappointing provided you would like getting more than 10,000 miles out of it before they poop out."
2,Basic Basic Basic,"This book offered very little new information other than the basics that any of us who have ever done process improvement already know. Although the authors mention how Lean works in non-manufacturing environments, their examples are almost purely manufacturing.Not a bad read for a college student, but a waste of time for practitioners. Totally an introduction."
5,Excelent!,If you work In healht management... Buy it! It's a open minder!It's impossible to manage without leaning thinking!Here In Brazil we're doing a lot: leaning thinking In healht!
4,Worth Every Penny,A most readable book on an important subject of productivity. The comment on outsourcing is insightful and the emphasis on human element is so crucial. Productivity is not all about bigger and better machines but about management and employee been willing to take risks to think out of a box. Mr. Womack has made a significant contribution to the on-going dicussion of productivity in a globalized world.
2,Lean Thinking is too rich,"The concepts in the book are true and very well established. The problem underlies with business thinking preaching ""lean thinking"" at every meeting and thus drives the market price of this book up. The book was good but way too expensive."
4,Lean Thinking Works,"This book is a practical guide through lean thinking & principles. Highly readable, immediately applicable. A must for any professional rolling out Lean. I have been going through the chapters and returning time and again for bits and peaces that I can use in my own work. Excellent,usable and exciting to read."
3,ABRIDGED,"This book is great however one should know that the cd's are grossly abridged. It isn't well advertised on Amazon or on the actual packaging. Otherwise, there is a lot to learn in this book."
4,Useful reading through out the organizations,"Lean Thinking is a very useful book as a reference material for a Bachelor/Master degree student or person already working, looking for information on LEAN.Author's explains the concepts with good examples and approachable way making the partly difficult topic more reader friendly.Book does not always provide clear answers yet challenges the reader to think and consider own approaches when basics is been understood.As a business book, very enjoyable reading."
2,Could use more detail,"I think it would have been better in print, some of the concepts are hard to follow on tape"
2,Not one of Womack's best works,"I personally do a vast amount of reading with lean enterprise being of special interest. Womack has done some great work, but this is a ""tough read"" even for serious lean enthusiasts. I typically finish a book of this length within 2-3 days then re-read it and highlight. It literally took me 11 weeks because I was lulled to a point in which reading further would be of no benefit and would have to put it back on the shelf and revisit it days later. I realize that scholarly and business writing is not especially exciting as I am constantly reading and doing research but this one was tough even for me, an avid reader."
2,There are better DVDs out there,"This is probably one of the worst example of a documentary on Near-Death Experiences. The FX are very cheap and in the segment about the African pastor, most of the dialog is so mumbled, you can hardly tell what they are saying.While the message and the subject ARE valid and very relevant. This DVD is not. Do not waste your money on this."
3,Good History of Jack Russells,The Courageous Companion provided a nice history about the origin of the Jack Russell Terrier and some good information about the breed as it stands today. I was looking for better insight into how to get a Jack Russell puppy to have its high-energy level satisfied via human play time and also how to facilitate a JRT puppy/JRT older dog relationship and I felt like many of these questions were left unanswered.
4,Not for the meek of heart,"These Icelandic sagas are fascinating in their portrayal of this harsh bygone era. Egils Saga is a fine example of what the vikings were up to long before Chris Columbus got the urge to sail a boat across the sea. It was a savage, violent era but still there was poetry. This is an intriguing paradox but I guess it shows how much the times have changed. The saga of Egil is a compelling one. He is both killer and poet. He is a savage and a family man. I would be lying if I said I would like to have lived through this era but it is interesting to read about nonetheless."
4,Egil's Saga,"This book translated by Hermann Pálsson and Paul Edwards is well worth the money. It's writing style is fairly smooth and the translation seems to follow the original text nicely. However, the poetry that Egil recites is thick and slow, but this is to be expected in Old Norse translation. The plot in Egil's Saga takes a while to get started since it begins with his grandfather but this helps prepare you for Egil's journeys. After all, Icelanders spend much time with genealogy. Also, The text is accompanied by an excellent introduction. However, like most introductions, you want to read it after finishing the book since it gives a lot away. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book."
3,A glimpse into the world of the Vikings,"I am no scholar of the sagas; in fact, this is only the third one that I've read. I don't know how close this translation is to the original, but I am impressed that the poetry follows (for the most part) the Germanic/Scandinavian alliterative style, not something easy to achieve in translation. It's hard to say how much of the story is legitimate history and how much is legend, but it does give an interesting picture of Norway and Iceland in the ninth and tenth centuries, especially regarding what led many people to begin settling in Iceland. A good read overall, though quite different from the the more ""mythological"" sagas (namely Hrolf's Saga and the Volsung Saga) that I had read previously."
1,It came already broken!!,It could have been a good work out DVD but it came broken and I gave up 7 minutes in when it was scratched so bad I couldnt hear sound and the DVD stopped playing. I am very upset it was not cheap!!
5,Great overall body workout,"I love this workout! It's divided into sections (core, upper body, lower body, etc), so it's easy to accomodate your time. If I only have 45 minutes, I do the core program; if I have more time, I add on one of the 15 minute upper or lower body programs. The core program is definitely for an advanced exerciser - it is a wonderful overall body workout complete with weights, stability ball and medicine ball. You'll have to purchase those items - they're a basic part of the programs. I love the way it makes me feel and the results I get."
5,Toning,"I previously tried Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred and HATED it! She doesn't even do the exercises with you and the work out is boring. I tried this DVD for the first time and really liked it. David Kirsch does all the exercises with you and is encouraging and informative. I like to have help with free weight exercises and this definitely provided that. I was pleasantly surprised at the number of work outs available (most are 15 min with the Core workout being 45 min); this DVD is best suited for those that want to tone/build muscle. The music beat is not in time with his counting, but it is easy enough to ignore. You will sweat after this DVD and I can see how you could get results in 2 weeks!"
4,Great results; somewhat difficult,"This exercise is great; after doing 15 days of this work out, I had great results, I was more toned and had more energy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is trying to firm up and lose a few pounds. More importantly it is great when trying to become stronger. Keep dedicated to this and you will see results."
1,Found is extremely boring and amateurish - did not finish watching.,"What can I say. This one was a waste of money for me, but with my discount, not a waste of a lot of money."
5,TRUE INNOVATORS,"THIS IS R.H. HARRIS AT THE PEAK OF HIS CAREER.ONCE YOU'VE HEARD HIS INCREDIBLE PITCH IT'S NO WONDER SAM COOKE WAS HAND PICKED AS HIS PROTEGE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS THE INFLUENCE FOR SMOKEY ROBINSON AND EDDIE KENDRICKS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT IS THIS GROUP THAT THE TEMPTATIONS GOT THE IDEA OF USING TWIN LEADS FOR ULTIMATE CONTRAST AND FLAVOR."
4,"Well done, Naomi!","The people who made this movie had their act together, so to speak. Cast and crew did a superb job, to the point where it's easy to forget that it is indeed a movie, not a documentary.Since a number of extensive reviews have already been written, rather than cover old ground, I'd just like to note (as a thus far undiscovered script writer myself) how the Ellie Parker screenplay manages to weave humor with some serious observations about Hollywood without resorting to low rent gags or bogging down with overt social messages. A brisk pace is maintained pretty much throughout, and even in scenes which essentially involve one on one dialogue, thought is given to add interest - an example being the art gallery where Ellie seeks consolation from her best friend."
2,More Hollywood inside baseball,"Can't filmmakers think of anything else but how interesting their own lives are? Really, this is another spoof of how movies are made, how actors behave, how the film industry grinds up people etc etc. There must be dozens of these things. Movies about the movies. Zzzzzz. This one is shot on video and looks it. There's no plot. Just something about the trials of an actress and her life. It has its moments, and I did watch the whole thing. But, why, I'm not sure. Take your chances."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"If this had been made like six years ago when the writer/director made the original short film that this is based on it could have had some impact, but whatever value it has as a reality acting thing, a satire/mockumentary, or a raw intimate indie flick seems redundant and ineffectual in 2006.The trailer made it seem more entertaining and less mundane than it is. I was surprised by how long it took for any supporting characters to be established, and after the halfway point when it became apparent it was going nowhere I started fastforwarding bits, and when you reach that point you know you've wasted not only your money renting the movie, but your time watching it.The ten second montage of her twirling around with the videotape tape was one kinda kewl part. If you're expecting any more funny lines like ""i was thinking about johnny depp"" in the trailer, don't."
3,Agonizing!,"I've been interested about this movie for a while and I finally saw it.Gosh that was an agonizing experience!We see Ellie Parker,a struggling actress through her auditions,and private life and we cant help but feel really sorry for her.If Naomi Watts is not an A- list movie actress,I would feel more sorry for her.Its kind of a relief to see that Watts is just doing this film as a sideline,or else we would imagine the actress playing Ellie leading a life as pathetic as her character.About the movie,its entertaining,in a weird way.It's style is quite experimental,like as independent movie.I dont like it very much but I dont hate it either.Watching this movie is as I said,an experience.And the acting is not bad at all."
2,Pass on this one........,"From the blurbs and other things I had heard of this movie I sure expected to like it more. In fact I hated it. There were some interesting and ""weird"" moments. And Watts is very talented, so I got the feel she was doing someone low on the totem pole a payback favor by starring in this.It movies and meanders so slowly. Nothing much gets said or done. I saw none of this black comedy it promised except perhaps for the russian producers scene. I am sure I would have liked the 16 mintute short much more. Like another reviewer I found myself fast forwarding towards the middle when a scene just went on and on. Bad sign!The best thing I loved about this movie was seeing the streets, the skyline of LA....the twinkling lights...I lived there for 4 years and that is one of the things I so miss about!"
2,Movie looks like a home video,"I purchased this movie and was very surprised to see that it was shot using a hand held video camera and didn't really look like a ""real"" movie at all. It looked more like it was produced by a 1st year film student who got lucky and was able to procure some name actors to appear in it. I still haven't been able to sit through it in its entirety, and may not invest my limited recreational time in this movie. Too much other better stuff to watch first."
1,"Silly, fake soap opera","""What is it?"" Kurt Vonnegut overheard a Martian visitor say. ""What can (life on earth) possibly be about. . .just blow jobs and golf?""No, Martian visitor, there are horrible movies also. (Although Naomi Watts is talented. . .and because she is very beautiful and momentarily nude, I admit replaying the bubble bath scene five times.)"
2,Oversimplified and Fairly Useless,"I read this book at the recommendation of my psychiatrist. I have moderate OCD. For what it is, the book is okay. It does describe OCD fairly well and probably for the very mild cases you can do what is suggested in the four steps and be ""cured"". This, however, was not the case for me. I was somewhat disheartened by Schwartz anti-medication slant. Medication has allowed me to fully function and literally gave me my life back from OCD. It's not a cop out, and it's very disturbing that he implies it is. Am I mindful of my actions when I'm having OCD thoughts? Yes. Is that the cure, no. There is no cure. Just coping and dealing."
5,Excellent read,"This is a great book, which is written in a clear and simple language, and which offers a message of hope. OCD sufferers and their helpers will find it very valuable reading. I was led to it through a recommendation in the book 'Obsessive Compulsive Disorder' by Frederick Toates and Olga Coschug-Toates. The latter offers the perspective of a psychologist/sufferer and makes a strong combination with 'Brain Lock'."
1,If you like stories this is your book,"I have been a psychotherapist for over 20 years. Treating OCD is quite difficult. The book made it sound as if it is easily fixable. The author didn't include some of the most simple interventions. Someone with severe OCD may be discouraged and ""a failure"" after reading this book.I was so hoping this would be a good adjunct to therapy, unfortunately, there was a paucity of behavioral techniques along with cognitive techniques that would help a patient. This might be somewhat helpful for people living with a person with OCD, however, it is not a good self help book."
4,I was obsessive about reading it!,"This is a very easy to read book regarding OCD and it's different manifestations. A must read for compulsion sufferers, a little more emphasis on purely obsessional illness would have rated it 5 stars. All in all though, a great book."
2,Not what I thought...,"Someone had suggested this book to me in 2006 when my OCD was clearly taking over my life. So my boyfriend sat down with me for an hour everyday and we read the book together.It explains OCD and steps you to ""control"" it... but this book just didn't work for me."
3,Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior,"Helpful self-help program for persons with OCD written by one who has extensive medical experience treating OCD. The book, however, is poorly written, somewhat disorganized, repetitious and redundant."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I have suffered for about a year with obsessive thoughts about homosexuality, I hate them more than anything in the world and cannot get rest from them. This book does little to address the nature of sexual obsessions it's always about hand washing or hoarding. It also repeats itself constantly and never really gives the reader an active program to fight their obsessions. The amount of real information about OCD minus all the stupid stories and constant reference back to their program at UCLA presented in this book would only fit in a pamphlet let alone a 200 page book. I wouldn't waste my time with this book if I were you."
5,Good for purely obsessional thinkers!,"I don't have OCD, but I am a purely obsessional thinker. This book helped me immensely! A person can benefit greatly if they are sure to practice the four steps. After reading the book, I felt better than I had in a while. I would also suggest ""Stop Obsessing"". Even if you don't have compulsions, this book is helpful."
3,Brain UN Lock,A really clear layman's view of OCD and other neurological issues. I found it very helpful
4,decent,"The steps outlined by Schwartz are highly useful. This is not a clinical book, but certainly one with great value to the general populace."
3,Self Evident,"Bearing in mind I don't have a severe case of OCD, I found the recommendations in the book to be a bit obvious. In fact I found I already did them before reading the book. The author repeats points over and over again- he could have used a better editor for a slimmer volume. I lent my copy to a friend with worse OCD, so we'll see if she gets more out of it."
4,Good but recommended by nephew's therapist,"As with a review I wrote for a purchase for my OCD nephew, I am told by my sister (his mom) that this is helping with his therapy sessions."
5,"Without Question, This book has changed my life!","There are almost no superlatives to describe what this book, and it's accompaning 4 step, self treatment method has already done in my life. I am just now getting the hang of applying the 4 steps to my own daily life, and people are noticing changes in my mood, my checking rituals, my tics [i have tourette's syndrome too] people that didn't even know I was reading this book have commented on the changes in my ocd/tourette's related behavior.The Steps are incredibly easy to apply, as long as you apply yourself to them [this is where the hard work comes in] and it just plain makes sense that RELABELING a disorder and recognizing it for what it truly is relief in and of itself.if Knowing is half the battle, this book is a blueprint for winning the WAR against OCD!"
4,eashgib,very good resource for learning about ocd. it is an easy read for the client. explains what ocd is and what it is not.
4,Gives great case studies.,"Very insightful and, the writer provides excellent feedback for the individual case studies which I found helpful in applying to my own understanding as well. Well written, extensive types of conditions covered too. Generally helpful to ANYONE even if he or she does not suffer from OCD. Good book."
2,Pamphlet in book form,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is extremely repetitive and poorly written. I feel like the information provided could have easily been covered in a tri-fold pamphlet. The author tries to over simplify the subject, and although many stories of patients are given, they are similar stories. I am newly diagnosed with OCD and have only been researching it for a short period of time. This book did not offer me any information I had not already found out on my own by simple internet searches. His technique he offers for over coming OCD has done very little if anything for me personally."
3,Four steps are better than twelve,"This book is a must read for anyone dealing with (or who has a family member dealing with) OCD. The four steps are practical and a correlation is easily drawn (and referenced) to the practice of mindful awareness, which has a broader application beyond coping with OCD. Three stars because the author, throughout sections of the early chapters (and esp in the later chapters) devotes a lot of very detailed writing to individual case study. The book is great for learning and applying/practicing the four steps and segueing to mindfulness as a practice."
5,Beyond extraordinary,"It will help your OCD in tremendous ways... four steps that immediately change your brain, you'll be OCD-free in no time."
2,ehh..,it did not really help me with the OCD that i have. it's a good read and some helpful tips but not for me.
3,Half Pleased,Was not expecting this product to not having a power cord. I needed to buy one but okay other than that.
1,Unhappy,"I removed the responses as requested,because I was promised a game, and a replacement controller. I still don't have either and my grandson's birthday is in 2 weeks. I have not been able to find a replacement controller, for the playstation 1, unless I go to Springfield which is 38 miles from here. So I am not happy right now."
1,ripoff,this is a rip off almost $500.00 for new no way you can go to game world in las vegas and get it for $30 new in the box
5,Great system,The system works great. It plays all the games that i have for this system.i have no problems with it.
1,Doesn't work.,"I received the game in good timing but the console will not work. It powers on but will not read any disk, including one that is brand new. The controller that came with it does not fit console. I'm sending it back for a refund."
2,misleading,So i got the system which works fine but it failed to have any of the cords to hook it up to the tv for as much as i paided for the system it should have came with the cords. I had to double the money i had into it to get the cords. Not cool not cool at all
3,Below decent,"I was exited to relive my childhood with this system, but my dreams were crushed when it came with a broken open button and a broken controller. I emailed the seller and was exited to find out that they would ship me a new controller for free. That was 3 weeks ago and I doubt it will ever come. Thank god I didn't pay a lot for this..."
4,Ps1,Came it is used so of course a little scratches here and there works just great the open button is a little slow and the console came with no cables for power or av. But if u own a ps2 those cables are compatible. Over all I am happy with my purchase
2,this is silly,playstations should not be this pricey not ps1 as its a very old console an no one sells games for it in retail anymoreive seen these second hand and you would be lucky to get 20 dollars for one of these so i think this is a stupidly over priced item
1,Does Not Work,"Bought the original playstation console for my 4 year old son. When it arrived, I plugged it in, and.... nothing. No light, no sound from inside indicating power. I tried to contact the seller, only, the only way to ""contact"" them, was to send the product BACK to them, in hopes of maybe getting a response. My suggestion for this seller, is to test their product before sending them out, in order to guarantee satisfaction, of course, barring damage during shipping, should that arise."
1,Came broken,"Once this console had reached me, I no longer needed it. So when I tried it out so I made sure it worked to give to my friend, it didn't work, it turned on, but didn't read any of the discs I insterted into it. I tried getting back to seller: broommfield. They never contacted me back."
1,Returned for a refund,This Play Station 1 unit broke down within a few hours of receiving it. It has been returned for a refund.
5,great show about natural disasters,"If you want to see natural disasters or you are a science teacher like me that want to show to your students the action of mother nature and people doing stuff that put them in danger, police and fireman trying to rescue them. This is your dvd's, it shows flash floods, tsunamis, twisters, mud slides, dust storm, ice storms,class 5 hurricanes, helicopter crash, etc. Very at close, and short interviews to people that witness the event. The set includes 2 dvd's in their individual box-(it is a boxed set). It is a show made by the weather channel"
1,awful and useless,such sensationalistic drivel and that panders to people's fears without providing real science - I have no more to say.
5,there's just one little thing,"if you have bought lyford's book, _quill and beadwork of the western sioux_, you already have this book.yes, its a wonderful resource--i thought so when i bought i under its original title. i thought this book, with the different title, would expand upon the other.as long as you keep this information in mind, and only buy the book once under either title, you will be rewarded. since it was originally published by the government in 1940, there are no color plates, which is a great shame. however, some of the historic photos are worth the price of the book.the instructions for both quill and beadwork are very good. there is a section that briefly analyzes design elements, very useful for creating your own designs.i just wish i had known i already owned it under another title."
2,"Dated, short, and with some serious compatibility issues","My son is a Sonic completist and wanted to run Sonic R on his Windows 7 PC. While some note this is possible, it's a MAJOR hassle, and something that DOES NOT HAPPEN right out of the box.If you want to run this on a Windows OS made after 2003, you'll need to run this game in a specially emulated window using open-sourced, third-party software, PLUS you may need to tweak the source code itself, depending on your hardware.Sound like an undertaking? Well, it is.What makes this worse is that my son solved the game in just a couple days. That made it too short of a diversion for the amount of time and hassle I put into making it run on his machine.In short, unless you're a PC guru with time to spare rutting around in code and third-party software settings, skip this."
2,"Mr. Tuffy not so ""tuff""","Installed the tire liners as per the instructions, first ride with the liners got a flat, notorius goat head pierced right thru the liner and punctured the tube."
2,another mistitled hawk book,"If you're looking for a book that covers all the raptors that regularly occur in North America, forget it. A more honest title would've been 'Raptors of Northeastern Hawkwatch Sites.' Even then, northeastern hawkwatchers won't find Harris' Hawk in the book. The raptors Liguori does cover are done well, by and large, and I was particularly impressed with the treatments of both Harlan's Hawk and the Northern Harrier. But if you live in the West, as I do, you'll find the book less useful than the title suggests. Get yourself a Clark and Wheeler--it'll serve you much better. I'm looking forward to that frabjous day when hawkwatchers will escape their eastern bias, and discover that we have hawks in the West too."
1,Do not be fooled - NOT anything like a Segway,"This item has 4 wheels, not 2. This means no gyros, no leaning, no self-balancing, none of the breakthrough engineering that makes the Segway the way of the future.How they can list this as ""segway style"" is beyond me. If that is accurate than my car is Ferrari style in that it has a steering wheel, my wife is Pamela Anderson style in that she has two legs and some eyelashes and my cat is puma style in that he has some whiskers. In short, the comparison is misleading and dishonest (sorry, honey)."
1,Ripped Off,I think that the person selling these Electric Chariot Transporters is a bit of a con. Yesterday they were advertised for $429.00 Now they are $699
1,Knock off of a knock off,This is a knock-off of a knock-off. That's got to be a bad sign. A company called Rad2Go makes a knock-off of the Segway HT called the Rad2Go Q Electric Chariot. I saw it on urbanscooters.com and hear it's pretty good. This thing is a knock off of the Q.
2,Communist plot to take over the Segway,"""two legs baaaaaddd......four legs gooooooodd.""The tripod is the most stable structure.Three points constitute a plane.Four wheels demands a non-curved surface.Two wheels means lots of power consuming gyros and computers."
1,Waste of money,I bought this after my eyelid surgery to keep swelling down. Ha! The cooling effect was gone before I got to sleep!
4,A great read,"I enjoyed this book. I am a die-hard lover of John Edward and this book is right up anyone who watches that show's alley. If you don't enjoy Psychic storyline or do not believe that people can communicate with the dead you might want to pass on this book. However, if you enjoy learning more about Psychic phenomenon and the unknown and find this stuff kinda cool then this book is a must read. I loved learning what a Psychic's life is like. I really like reading books with differences that set them apart from each other. The flow of the storyline is excellent, there were no moments where I felt the need to lay the book down due to being bored. I also found myself checking the net for more books by this Author, always a sign I enjoy someones work. I suggest this book for anyone who enjoys seeing the world from a different perspective."
4,"The start of a fascinating, fun series!! What a great ride!","At this point I've read all the Abby Cooper books. I've enjoyed each of them immensely. I would rate each of them between 4 stars and 5 stars. This series is not written in the more serious style of say the Kay Scarpetta series, but rather in the more light, fun style of the Stephanie Plum series. However, the plot lines are a bit less whimsical, in my opinion, than that of the Plum books. I DO love the Plum series, but those plots are a bit more ""outside the realm of possible occurrences"" than this Abby Cooper series. Of course Abby does make some choices that are a tad annoying at times, but everyone is guilty of the same here and there...that's a part of life. The psychic angle is fanscinating and altogether believable. The books can be quick reads, to a degree, but what a fun, fascinating ride they are to take!"
4,"Easy, fun, fast read","I will definitely be reading more. This was a no-brainer fast read. I hope the rest of the books in the series can keep my attention but for a first book in a series, this wasn't bad. Usually you have to get into at least the second book before you are totally committed. The story hooked me within the first chapter. So I'm happy that this book made me willing to read the next."
4,Wonderful!,"I got the first three books in this series as a Christmas gift (I had to find them in the bookstore myself, though, lol) and I haven't been disappointed so far.I just finished ""Abby Cooper, Psychic Eye,"" and I'm now reading the second book in the series, ""Better Read Than Dead.""The mystery was very enjoyable and the main character actually did some snooping around (which every amateur sleuth should do, in my opinion). I liked the little psychic insights (how Abby sees things, etc.) which were made even more interesting by the fact that the author, Victoria Laurie, is a professional psychic herself. The rest of the cast of characters (like Abigail's sister, Cat) compliment the story and add something ""extra"" to keep it moving along. The author knows how to tell a good story without bogging down the reader with unnecessary details.Very good new series. Recommended!-Ater"
5,Very entertaining!,"I tried this book at the suggestion of the girl working in my local Waldenbooks. I'm a huge Stephanie Plum fan and was looking for something similar (funny, romantic with danger throw in without being R rated or mushy). I loved this book! She was right on the money recommending Victoria Laurie. It's an easy read and very entertaining. As soon as I was finished with this one I had to run out and buy the second one. I can't wait to read the third. If you love the Stephanie Plum series you'll love these, too."
4,Enjoyed it!,"Abby Cooper is such a likeable heroine! In her impulsiveness there's wisdom, she's not heroic but she's certainly courageous.I don't know how I've missed this series but am I ever happy to have stumbled upon it this summer.There's a dash of paranormal along with a lot of suspense and mystery and just the right amount of romance. Victoria Laurie delivers a well-crafted story with a lot of surprising moments.My only regret is that the main male character, Detective Dutch Rivers lacked a little depth for me. I wanted to know more about him.Still, I'm going to read the other books of the series."
3,Predictable,"I had never heard of this author before, so I decided to give her a try since the book's story line immediately grabbed my attention.Regrettably, the entire book did not hold my attention. Mainly because her dialogue sounded extremely weak.I think she could have created a better story if she had written in the third-person. She could have really expanded on the characters.Also, I do not like author's who ""tell instead of showing."" I want to read the action as it unfolds in the story. I do not like second-hand accounts from the characters. I feel like I'm missing out on something.I am also a writer, and, I have a degree in English Literature.What happened to the days when author's included metaphors, symbolism, similes, unique dialogue, and did a good job of stringing along just the right action verbs so that the images jumped off the pages at you?"
4,Fun read w/ a strong female character,"This book gave me exactly what I wanted: an entertaining story with humor, good female character, and something supernatural (e.g. a psychic). It's perfect for vacation reading or when you want something fun. While the book is basically a murder-mystery, the best parts were watching Abby use her psychic abilities and her budding romance with Dutch. The romance was very well done, delicately building up the desire between Abby and Dutch. The only semi-negative part about the book was that sometimes I could guess what was going to happen next. (Or maybe the author wanted me to experience what it's like to be psychic... sorry, bad attempt of a joke.) Nevertheless, this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book. Sometimes ""knowing what is about to happen"" or the foreshadowing made the book even more exciting.I look forward to reading more about Eggy the dog. And I think I've already dreamed of the luscious Dutch. Ahhhhh! Great characters!"
5,"GREAT author, lousy publisher!","Settled in for a lovely Sunday afternoon with my new book. Fire roaring, soft French music on the stereo ......... you get the picture. LOVED the book. It's creatively well written and the psychic information is what I've found to be true, so it's great having this affirmation of how psychic news works. Then I get to page 88 ...... and the next page printed is page 169. Sigh. Penguin has totally misprinted the book. I've never seen this happen before, but was not surprised since every few pages the print in this paperback is quite light and obviously not well done. I've subsequently ordered a lot of ten of the Abby Cooper series on eBay so as not to pay anywhere near full price (these are not discounted at all!) for this poorly printed series. We shall see if I get all the pages."
3,Tedious Character,I love a good cozy mystery. I have read most of the books in this series and have to say it ranks as average simply because the main character is agravating most of the time. She makes obviously stupid errors in judgement and risks life threatening peril regularly because of it.Remember the old Nancy Drew mysteries? Well Abby Cooper is the updated version of Nancy Drew with psychic ability. She still has to be saved by a man in most every instance.
5,a lifesaver!,"I admit that this book isn't a great deal of fun. It's pretty dry, but if you go over the words a few times, they'll stick. The book splits into 3 sections, so you can easily just choose to do the harder words or the easier ones.It's definitely a must-buy book if you're looking to take the SAT I reasoning test. I'd say 95% of the words on the critical reading section were in this book, and it definitely helped me get my 800. This book is amazing, and I recommend it to anyone looking to improve their test scores or just vocabulary in general."
1,AUDIO IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK,"The CD and MP3 download are nothing like what you see in the book. Instead of being divided into three sections: words you should know, harder words you should know, and really really hard words, it is divided into five sections: Word Roots, Words You Think You Know But Don't, Non-English English Words, Cultural Words, Similar Sounding Words, and Review.""Presently"" is alleged NOT (their emphasis) to mean at the present, but only in the near future. THIS IS WRONG! Some of the definitions are wrong. It is not worth 7 dollars."
3,Mark's Review,The definitions were sometimes confusing or just not very good. I had to look them up sometimes. The first section has words that are too easy and the last section has words that are too hard and probably won't show up on the test. It's still OK if your standards aren't too high and it might depend o the test you're studying for. I was studying for the GRE.
4,I hate her 'happy' attitude but LOVE her results,I've used plenty of her videos in the past and she's always been the best results. Her very 'Happy' attitude does get annoying but it does make you want to finish and work harder. This DVD has different levels and different choices which is great for when you are ready for the next step up.
2,"Would be a good workout, if the cues were better","I was excited to purchase this dvd because I did strength training to Denise's 10 min series of vhs tapes in highschool. In the last year, I have been on a journey to lose a significant amount of weight, so I figured I would try this to switch up my workouts. The sound quality was awful, adding to the frustration I felt trying to keep up the cues that were too quick (in my opinion)"
3,Not that great,"I thought that this was not a great exercise video. I did like the Kickboxing portion, but that was it. Everything else seemed too fast, she sped through everything, and kind of looked disorganized. I love Denise and have about 10 of her DVD's, but this was a disappointment and a flop. I tried it for the first time, and it was my last time."
3,Not one of Denise's best efforts,I would not recommend this to anyone who is just starting out. Not that it is that difficult it isn't - Denise's calls are so far off - she is just about to the next move when she calls the one she is almost done with. Or so it seems. It is a shame this is a nice work out - the 10 segmants keeps the pace and does not get boring. If you do this a few times and get a feel for what Denise is going to do next - you will end up with a very nice workout that can work you into a sweat if you bump the moves up a tad.
2,Denise Austin-Burn Fat Fast-Cardio Blast,I was not impressed with this. I love Denise Austin's workouts but this one I was wishing the whole time it was over. I don't know it wasn't as fun and energetic as her other ones.
3,"It's okay, I didn't really break a sweat","I love Denise Austin. Her Bootcamp DVD is one of my favorites. I reach for it all the time, which is interesting because I get bored quickly. Anyway, this DVD was okay. It was a bit too easy for me. I did like that you could mix and match the segments. That was cool. I have quite a few DVDs and have not seen that before. I was expecting more and I barely broke a sweat."
1,you have to be an expert dancer to do this tape,"I usually like Denise Austin tapes but this one is a waste of time. It's very difficult to memorize the dance steps and why bother. I just want aerobics, not all the fancy dance steps."
3,good condition,"This package was great everything was like brand new the DVD was not scratched but, didnt really care for the movie,"
3,"Gets your heart pumping, but can be difficult to follow","I bought this because I needed to do some cardio exercise. This seemed like a good DVD because of the variety and the fact that each segment is only 10 minutes. I like that you can mix and match which segments you want to do, and I admit it gets my heart pumping. But the cues are difficult to follow because Denise jumps into another move without any warning. I feel like I'm not getting the full effect of the workout because I'm concentrating on trying to follow her moves. Also, her routines are only ok. I really enjoy the kickboxing one but the other ones have some weird moves that I have trouble following (especially Cardio Dance)."
5,Awesome Aerobics,For ten years I did the Tae Bo with Billy Blanks. I loved that and still do. I really wasn't into the girlie stuff but tried Denise because I wanted to do something different with my muscles. I thought she would be too easy after working out with Billy but I was WRONG!!! She wears me out. And I love the way she divides her workouts into 10 or 20 minutes. It seems to make the workout go faster because I don't get bored. I will most certainly continue to order her DVD's.
4,Denise Austin: Burn Fat Fast - Cardio Blast,"Overall, this is a very well-done DVD. What I really like is that you can create your workout routine before you start the video, you move from one workout to the next without stopping. I like it a lot, I definitely recommend it... The Dance part is a little difficult to me, but you can dance your way and have fun and keep going..."
3,good workout,"This exercise DVD gives you a good workout. The dance steps are easy to follow and could get boring, but since each segment is only 10 minutes it doesn't matter. Denise can grate on your nerves, but she was okay on this DVD."
3,Okay not great!,Not a bad workout but Denise is really hard to follow and can be annoying with her voice. I think there are better Dance workouts out there!
4,Keeps me motivated!,"This is the third Denise Austin DVD I've bought and I just love her. She is overly perky at times, but hey isn't that part of an exercise instructor's job? I love that you have four choices, you can do only one section or all four if you feel like it. The kickboxing is a great workout and I totally love the Cardio Dance. I could Mambo all night if it keeps burning off the calories! I'll buy more of her DVD's in the future!"
5,Birthday presents and making fun of Towns,"I loved the book, but the part about the Blue and Yellow Paper freaks made me think on the second read. Near where I live there's a University where I guess you could say that there are tons of Blue and Yellow Paper freaks, just try to do anything on a game day and you'll be stuck in traffic. (If you know anything about College colors you'll find that Michigan has both ""towns"" that are used in the book, the Red and White of MSU and the Blue and Yellow of U of M) I happen to love Dragons. Gleeep!"
3,"Good, but not great.","Myth Directions was an ok book but nothing like the Shannara series or the Sword of Truth series. I guess I liked it mainly because it was kind of funny, and it also had some action in it. I'm not saying you should read it, just that you can if you have free time, and if not...no biggy."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"What do you get for a wisearse demon magician?This is the problem that Skeeve and Tanda the Trollop have to deal with, and of course it involves a whacky tour all over places-that-are-not-there to try and find something that they think is suitable, and actually get to bring it back. I think there might even be a college football satire in this one."
4,very timely,"This book shows the state of the world in the 1930's, before the outbreak of WWII.A great love story and after all sorts of setbacks and disappointments, true love finally prevailed.It was written after all the convulsive changes had taken place -the end of British rule in Asia; the lessening of racial bigotry between whites and non-whites; the eroding of tension between Malays and Chinese. All these had gradually taken place after end of WWII.It had a retrospective look but it was done marvellously well.I am somewhat surprised that the author was not really a novelist but a journalist. He did a great job in producing this novel"
1,Beware,"Hello, I am Alberto Villoldo. Please beware that this video was released without my knowledge. It is a poorly filmed documentary of a talk I gave at a conference years ago, and has no relevance to my book Shaman Healer Sage...While the talk is good, the title is misleading. I cannot recommend or endorse this video, which was released in this format without my knowledge."
4,Brutality and Compassion,A distinct look at Mayor who lacks the mental wherewithal to help his Burghers and a downed RAF Pilot in occupied Holland. He is the distinct opposite of his young son. Brings out the character in Humans.
1,Not worth the plastic it's made out of,"The camera has no display and even the adults cannot even tell when a picture has been taken. The driver disk provided did not allow us to download any pictures. This was tried on 3 different, up-to-date, computers. Buy something else!"
2,Crappy pictures,"The pictures are horribly grainy. I figured for the price they wouldn't be great, but not as bad as they are. Plus, the real reason I chose this camera was for the ""kid-friendly photo editing software"", and it is confusing to navigate for an adult! I thought it would be easy to figure out, and it is not. Spend a little more and you can get a much better camera."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!,"My son got this for christmas. It was difficult for even the adults to figure out. The pictures were VERY grainy and VERY difficult to download. My [...] son was so disappointed that he could not use it. We finally threw it in the garbage can where it belonged and got him a low cost REAL digital Sony for [...] Wish we would not have wasted the [...] on this. I should say, we did NOT expect great images from this camera, we just thought that he could easily take some low quality shots and put them on the computer. Even the adults got frustrated trying to figure it out. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,I can't believe they're still selling this camera,"I got two of these cameras for my kids last Christmas ('04). One broke on Christmas day and the other broke about two weeks later. Furthermore, my kids weren't even all that interested in them, which makes it all the more surprising that they broke. These things are junk."
3,Not what I expected,It took me a while to figure out how to attach the lens to the camera. Once I did that I was surprised to see that pictures have rounded corners that require cropping. Maybe I'm not using the lens correctly but so far that's what I've discovered. I'm not an expert by any means.
4,Loved it,"Once again, Bishop Jakes gives us a solid release. God is using this man in an awesome way to spread His message. God bless and keep you Bishop Jakes and the Potter's House."
4,Templar Organization,"A great addition to a Templar Enthusiast's library. The author addresses the organization and function of the Order from a business like concept. Most illustrations in the book are hand drawn, but it doesn't detract from the information.Recommended purchase."
5,IT CAN WORK!,"Mr. Greider has shown us in this book that ordinary citizens can re-invent their economic future and themselves, even though most of Washington reacts to this with a yawn. This book also shows the American system of global finance as both a wonderful and dreadful beast. How can this beast be tamed? By people willing to do the hard work to bring out the best in the beast and to make capitalism work for most citizens."
2,Not what I expected.,The workbook was merely copies of the questions found at the end of each Chapter in the textbook.
3,Too Brassy,As my mom used to always say about bands in the fifties. Too brassy. Meaning too many trumpets and not enough clarinet and mellow trombone. These recordings are made during the fifties and remind me of the background music of Sinatra or the intro to the Jackie Gleason show. Not what I would consider the swing era. If you like that sort of thing then go for it.
2,Worked okay but broke right away,"I bought this to replace another collar light that required me to turn it on every time I wanted to use it. I was skeptical of it's plastic casing, but not having to worry about forgetting to turn it on at night was a plus. And it did work as described. I could leave the switch on, and it would light up at night as promised. However, after two week, the plastic broke, and it fell off my dog's collar. I am looking for a higher quality, photo sensitive product to replace this, but I am repurposing it. I've stuck it in the rafters of my chicken coop to keep the nighttime predators away. I've heard a red, flashing light will detour the mink/weasles/etc from slaughtering my chickens. And so far, so good! Now, if I could find a product with the same features in a better package for my pup, we'd be all set. I may just buy a couple more of these for my chickens."
5,Great unscented body wash,"I started using Aveeno unscented body wash when I was pregnant and all the smells and scents were making me nauseas. I loved it so much that even after giving birth I'm still using it. It feels great on my skin, doesn't dry it out, keeps it soft and clean. A little drop goes a long way since it leathers up really well. The subscribe & save price is lower than in the supermarket that I used to buy it. I will definitely keep the subscription going."
4,Best body wash ever,"I have sensitive skin and winter is horrible. This is the only thing that gets me through! It lathers great, smells great and leaves a very subtle sleekness on your skin after your wash. It protects me until the next bath!!"
2,not good,"from these movies i have seen 1,4,5,6, and 7, the dream child was easily the worst one, the deaths airen't as gory the plot is just really boring, in this movie freddy gives his comedic side a taste, i think freddy should just be a cold-hearted killer than some clown.Freddy needs to be more evil. also the ending was a big let down, usaully in the freddy movies theres a big finale between the hero and freddy, in this one alice might as well just hit him with a bat. and it seems in this movie alice has forgotten how to tap into the power of the dream world. if your looking for a good freddy movie, DONT get this, only get it if it is the uncut version"
3,Nightmare V Review,"Freddy Krueger is back and this time, he's after the unborn child of the previous film's survivors. Lisa Wilcox returns as Alice, who conquered Freddy in ""Nightmare 4"", but the razor-fingered Krueger is back for retribution.This sequel is a lot darker, atmosphere-wise, than the fourth, though it still relies a bit on Freddy's one-liners. Alice's new group of friends aren't much to look at and even the ones that make it past Round One with Freddy are pretty boring and don't have much to do. Cool dream sequences involving comic-book animation and a swimming pool are neat eye candy but the story gets kind of tired (no pun intended) quick.If you liked the previous ""Elm Street"" movies, this one should keep you entertained. This particular video features the ""unrated"" version of the film with the original gore scenes included. They were omitted from the R-rated New Line re-release."
3,it was ok,I love the nightmare saga but this on disapointed me a little.It had great special effects like always but the plot was very confusing. If i had to rate the nightmare series it would go like this : 1.dream warriors 2.freddys revenge 3.nightmare on elm street. 4.dream child 5.new nightmare 6.freddys dead 7.dream master
3,Cute--predictable,"This book was similar to the others in the series. Really, if you've read one, then you've read them all. However, that doesn't mean the book was bad. It was a nice bit of light romance. I enjoy this author's style of writing--it's light; it's humorous; it is optimistic and happy. Sometimes that's what I want in a romance."
3,Paris La Belle Epoque CD,"The content quality of the CD wasn't good. If I had heard a sample of the CD before I bought it, I would not have purchased it."
4,Rebus: The early years,"I bought the early trilogy because the hard backs were out of print. The first three novels came in an easy to hold and read softcover edition.The book was well worth the money. Knots and Crosses was the first read in the book. It was nicely written, taut, short and a good introduction for Detective Sargent Rebus.The second book, Hide and Seek was long and not nearly as engaging as the first book.Tooth and nail found a nice happy medium between books one and two. Well written; more polished.The softcover edition can be purchased very reasonably, and presents a good value to detective story readers.G.G."
3,My expectations might have been too high for such a bargain.,"I'll admit my expectations might have been a bit high for a book I got so inexpensively, but past expereinces had been much better. The book I recevied is certainly readable, but it is water-stained and more than a little worn -- not the condition I expected from the seller's description. I would encourage the seller to be a bit more precise in descriptions of individual books. All that being said: I'll enjoy reading it, but I'll likely not proudly put on my shelf. However, since it was such a bargain, that might not have been a realstic expectation. I will say the book was shipped quickly, and arrived before expected -- always a plus. As such, I would probably try the seller again if the occasion presented itself."
4,Fun -- kids like that they can understand all the non-English words,"Great word play and a funny story of excuse-making. Baloney will have your kids laughing... and imagining what comes next!Just a weird, zany book -- but fun!"
1,RIP-OFF ARTICLE.. DON'T WAIST YOU CASH...,"Biggest rip-off AMAZON HAS EVER SOLD.. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELFJEFF BEZO.. THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE PRICE, NOT EVEN CLOSE.. ONLE 400 WORDS FOR OVER 6 DOLLARS.. CALLED TECH SUPPORT AND REALLY GOT THE RUN-A-ROUND.. GREAT BERRIES.. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE ARTICE BY THESE FOLKS."
5,Perfect Product!,Undoubtedly perfect product. Bought to complement my alarm system and has been performing great. Highly recommended for anyone who has a need for it.
1,This version is a RIPOFF!!,"I have no idea why this is so ridiculously expensive when Guild Wars Trilogy (drop the Pack when you search) can be had for a fifth of this price. The game is phenomenal, but this price is a total ripoff.SEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY!!"
1,WHAT?,"Guild Wars is a 7 year old game, I have played it for 5 years and I have already pre purchased Guild Wars 2.You can buy all 4 Guild Wars games (Guild Wars, Factions, Nightfall & Eye of The North) for about 1/3 the price of this.Not only that but the product picture shown here is for the 14 day/10-hour trial. Notice how the picture says ""Try all 3 Guild Wars Games"". I have this disc sitting right in front of me. I suppose the seller could be using the wrong picture for this item.GUILD WARS COMPLETE COLLECTION INCLUDES ALL 4 GAMES(Do not buy a used copy)"
4,takes me back!,"Great mix of recordings by a great band. All the hits are here, including their cover of I'll Take You There. The only thing I don't like about this is that ""Save it For Later"" is live. Would have loved to have the studio version of that one here. It's a pretty good recording though and has some cool stage banter on the front end, which will give you a good feel for the energy of the show it was from."
5,A Superstar In The Making,"Young Michael Jackson at his best.After this his first solo album, you knew that he was going to bea star (a superstar). Some of my favorites are ""Girl Don't Take Your Love From Me"", ""Maria (You Were The Only One)"" and ""In Our Small Way"" made this an album that I had to listen to over and over again. Any true Micheal Jackson fans need this one in their collection."
5,Fascinating,Really fascinating look into how some folks squeeze the system and turn other's obsession for online games into their own mini Fort Knox. In thurn they mostly become obsessed drones themselves chasing virtual gold. Nicely written book on an offbeat and timely topic.
3,Fun for those in the know,"I found the book very interesting because I am familiar with many of the people in the book. However, If you do not know what a mmorpg is, than perhaps this is not the book for you."
2,Pseudo-intellectual stuff ruins this book,"I had high hopes for this book to be informative and fun but it turned out to be a disappointment. I am not sure if the author had to justify the scholastic grant he received for writing about the topic so he felt he had to interject the fun topic with a lot of pseudo-intellectual analogies/comparisons or personal reflections. Who cares if this game reminds anyone of the Turing Test, or if this is work or play? Everything is work to someone but play to another. His relentless (but failed) attempt to attach significance to this work just makes the book boring and haphazard. Whenever he writes about the intellectual meanings of this ""phenomenon"", his writing style changes -- a bunch of words that don't really mean anything...just string them together so they sound smart."
3,Patchy,"This book is well-written (mostly) and a good look at an interesting subject. However, the author seems not to trust his own subject, since he constantly moves away from the interesting part of the book (the story of how the strange market in imaginary goods works) in order to pad the book out with boring digressions on watching his daughter play, or even more boring half-baked essays on What It All Means (no surprise that the author is a contributor to Wired magazine.) Still, if you read the reporting parts, which are good, and skip over the self-indulgent, meandering attempts at philosophy, which are not, you'll learn a lot and enjoy yourself."
1,Not worth it.,"This is really just another blog-turned-book, with a little bit of filler. The title misrepresents the book - he didn't quit his day job and he didn't even hit his fairly modest goal of a month's earnings exceeding his best as a writer, which is far short of the ""millions"" the subtitle advertises. I'd give him a pass if the title was obviously sarcastic, but it seems like a cheap ploy to up sales figures. The real slap comes about halfway through the book when blog posts are reproduced wholesale, which can easily be found on the internet on Dibbell's website.Dibbell is a good writer, but this book just doesn't come close to delivering. If you want a basic account of how you could have exploited Ultima Online five years ago, then by all means, this is the book for you. For everyone else, it's an extended blog post - a quick, basic read that doesn't have a whole lot of substance to it."
4,Hurtado's valuable contribution.,"Professor Hurtado has produced a scholarly work probing the preference of early Christians for the codex system and their use of ""tau-rho"". Much of this material may be obscure for those unfamiliar with this field, but for those familiar with a limited level Greek (at least the ability to recognize Greek characters and pronouciation skills), along with minimal knowledge of Textual Criticism and manuscript issues - they will find this treatise enjoyable and intriguing."
2,"""Where's the rest of me?"" - Ronald Reagan in ""King's Row""","Is it just me, or shouldn't a work which purports to teach how to use a shell which includes such conditional statements as ""if"", ""else"" and ""then"" actually explain their syntax and usage... or even ACKNOWLEDGE their existence in more than passing?This book contain NO instructions on how to use statements to control program flow. I can't even find the word ""if"" in the index. That is the equivalent of a driver's education video which never shows the steering wheel or how it's used, and only alludes without explanation to its existence.Apparently other people writing about Csh/Tcsh seem to think so, since they at least bother to mention statements which control program flow. Of course those sources were available free from the Web. I guess that the more expensive the source, the more nebulous and incomplete the information provided...."
3,"Too much nut, not enough shell",An absolute novice might find this book useful...but the book is thin and skips a myriad of essential info for the power user. Not one of the better 'nutshell' books.
3,Please do your research and buy with a warrenty.,"This was my first major buy on my own. I bought this TV Christmas 2007. I had it a total of 3 months and the humming began. The picture is good, but this humming drove me crazy. One day I finally called a repair company and had it fixed. I could have bought a new one at the price I paid for repairs. Also, the parts were back ordered and it took nearly 2 months to get in. The control panel often goes out on these...I would look into another TV if I had it to do all over again. It would save me a lot of annoyance and a lot of time.KEEP IN MIND:Since the repairs no problems... Buy with a warranty."
2,Failure was a good thing,"I purchased the 232v set from Circuit City in September, 2007 and got a very good price on it. Overall I was happy with the product, but found it buggy. The date and time never worked right and Olevia tech support suggested a firmware upgrade, which was the beginning and the end for this set.The firmware that I downloaded from the Olevia site killed the HDMI port on the set. Consulting with tech support, they sent me another firmware upgrade that killed the set. No picture, no audio. Their return policy does not favor the consumer in anyway.I had purchased the extended warranty, and I was told that the product is not even repairable, it is a return to vendor. I ended up trading in (and up) my set for a Samsung which looks great. Some picture issues have also gone away, which may be the difference between the 8ms response rate on the Olevia and the 6ms response rate on the Samsung. Overall I am much happier that I paid a few extra dollars and got the Samsung."
2,"TVok, remote not so","The picture is decent and the sound adequate, but the remote control is the worst I've ever used. It is alternately very touchy and totally unresponsive. Touch a button once and it jumps several places on a menu one minute, the next minute you press it fifteen times and nothing happens. Irritating enough to never buy another Olevia."
5,Dependable Tape,"We have used this backup system since I have been here. Tape is dependable, can get many uses out of it."
5,Backup tapes,Exactly as ordered. I have ordered these many times and they are always prompt and correct.
2,adequate but whiz premium a MUCH better product,title says it all...held less paint than the whiz premium and released it less smoothly...also DID NOT hold up as as well on multiple wash-ups...ended up these were basically Unused...the somewhat worn out whiz premiums were STILL better...IMO waste of money...go cheap(er)...go expensive...
4,"Nice, but shop around","Nothing wrong with these rollers. I've used them for years. Nice for polyurethane on plywood, or any smooth-finish situation, but I always thought $2 each was a bit much.Then I foundDynamic HM005318 Mini Foam Roller Refill, 10-Pack, 6-Inchfor under ten bucks at low tide. Under a dollar each, and the quality is fine.I wait for price dips and stock up. There's an ""Online Price Alert"" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done. Or try camemcamelcamel."
4,"Not his best, but still has some knockers!","King Nicky goes over and behind his previous cd and takes his creativity to a new level. Tracks with Equipto and Dubee are the most noteable. The rest of tracks are ok. The only real dissapointing thing about this album is that 4 or 5 of the tracks are recycled from other cd's. Even with that said, the new material is good and you should support Nicky and pick this cd up!"
1,VERY disappointing,"it seems like he has sold out or something. there is a definite change of style, and all the good songs that are characteristically spread throughout his other CDs are gone, traded for songs with a slightly catchy beat. show gone wrong is just a painful song, no real beat, so to speak, and his vocals sound like he was having writers block, stretching his lines longer, so it sounds like crap. the only saving grace is that he decided to include Ayo. had i known this was what i would have recieved, i would NEVER have bought this, despite being a huge fan."
5,AYO 4 yayo!,"LOL. i bought this just for the dvd cuz i already got the songs & it was a cool buy! i don't know much about dre dog except from his music & i wanna to check out his dvds so i bought this & the gift dvd (which i'm still waiting on?) but this dvd was a small movie a very small little bit on what he be doing i guess & the highlight for me was the concert they had towards the end! he performed nickatina says, smoke dope & rap, & ayo wit san quinn who came thru to perform, that was tight! equipto was also on the dvd! good stuff! pick it up & all his other albums & support the real! cuz dre dog is one of the best to ever touch the mic!"
4,Touching and good quality performance,the only other two versions I can compare this to is the Royal Ballet older version and high definiton version. The picture and sound quality is defintely better than Royal Ballet s older version and I also liked the dancing and choreography much more. The music was speedened up and the choreography was much more interesting and creative. I do not believe that it is better than the Royal Ballet s high definiton version but it was extremely touching and left an everlasting impression in my mind.
4,deserves more play.,"i love tina moore when i first heard ""never gonna let you go"" it is sad that she did not get any play.she has a fantastic voice like my girl shanice, tamia and my favorite ms. deborah cox.i wish people would sing like they did back in the 70's,80's and early 90's.any way if tina was to come out with another cd i would buy it. tina you rock."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"I had been searching something about TINA MOORE since I had listened her songs ""At Last"" and ""Never Let You Go"" years ago...and now ""at laaaaaast"" I have it!!! This album is really incredible, her voice is so beautiful and powerful like a great new diva (like Toni Braxton, Whitney, Deborah Cox...) and her songs are so soulful and sensitives that when I listen them, my heart stop and my soul is wrapped in a soft atmosphere...I'ts impossible for me to say only some songs, all are so good wonderful ballads, since ""I've come too far"" (maybe my favourite) to ""Going Away"", ""Time will tell"", ""The more things change"", ""Can I come home""...ALL!!! I hope this great singer will have the high place that she deserves in the R&B; lists (although unfortunely famous is not relationated with talent sometimes). Anyway there's no doubt this woman has the best talent...her voice!! Like her title...TIME WILL TELL!! A big kiss for all ;-)PD: I'm spanish...sorry if my english is not soo good!"
4,JUST GREAT,"Yet again this young lady have did it again with another beautiful cd I mean what more can I say but just EXCELLENT, BEAUTIFUL well put together. All I can say is listen to the words to each song "" GOING AWAY"" is just beautiful "" THE MORE THINGS CHANGE"" "" I'VE COME TO FAR"" are 3 of my favorite songs on this album but all in all the whole album is just great so I recommend you go out and put it in your collection"
1,Dont Buy,"These bow strings are very bad. For one, they dont have a ring to level the bow, but thats not the bad part. You get a pack of three bow strings per order. Of the three that I got, one broke after the second shot, and the other broke when I was restringing it. I was afraid to put the third one on for fear it would break when I was aiming it. I would not recommend this item to anyone. They are very cheap feeling and hard on the fingers. Again, dont buy these, they break after about 3 shots. Try to buy a little more expenisive ones that will atleast last a day. These stings are horrible."
3,Cute but...,This is a cute eyebrow ring and for the price it was ok but I bought it with the hope of seeing the pretty Aurora gem from a distance. Not so much... the balls are small which make the gem even smaller and unless you look really close and right at it you might hardly know it was an aurora gem at all.
5,This is a fantastic book,"I have used this book alot in the past year, sometimes as a main source for information. It is the best study guide out there for AP Biology, as it really teaches you the complex topics, without making you memorize and not learn. Analogies and practical applications make hard concepts remarkably easy to grasp. I would highly reccommend this book to both the A+ student and those who need support. This book is a keeper!"
5,YOU WILL GET A 5,"Absolutely AMAZING prep book. Difficult, complex concepts such as cellular respiration, and chemiosmosis are simplified, and the book is written in a conversational style. It is a good read, interesting, FUN.Also, was researched very well, told me exactly what to study. It is supposed to be used a supplement to the AP Bio textbook ... but I didn't read more than 5 chapters in my 60 chapter book, sat down with this the Sunday before the AP test, and got a 5."
5,the best book to review with,"this book is really good. it covers all the topics in the AP EXAM.IT HAS A STUDY PLAN FOR EVERY KIND OF STUDENT.I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ALL THE STUDENTS TAKING AP BIOLOGY.LAST YEAR, I WAS TAKING AP BIOLOGY. AND THANKS TO THIS GREAT STUDY GUIDE I PASSED THE AP EXAM."
2,Needs work,"As an unbiased reviewer, I found that this review book inadequately covered much of the material, sometimes leaving topics unexplained. Explanations for the multiple choice questions are also incomprehensive, with such explanations as 'You just have to know that.' Although the studying schedule is helpful, the diagrams are poorly drawn, and attempts at humor are merely distracting. I would recommend the Kaplan book."
5,A great buy,"Sometimes I have a hard time finding some inspiration to elevate my rehearsal standards, and breaking into new territory. This DVD did the trick for me. It gave me a variety of things to work on that were fun, and actually attainable. Keith is such a mellow character that speaks softly, but plays like a monster! I would recommend this to any drummer looking to advance their groove styles. Younger drummers especially. You gotta remember its all about the groove! Keith helps you get there in a fun, productive way!!"
2,Weighty in more ways than one,"My main problem with this hiking book is how it is crafted and its purpose. I grew up in a town along the coast and have spent my whole life hiking in southern California. The southern hikes listed in Foghorn Outdoors California Hiking are full of holes and what's really puzzling - - - missing maps. Forget about taking it along on the hike, it's as heavy as a bottle of water, and who wants to tear out pages."
5,Very informational! Great help!,I love this book! Details on hiking trails are mostly accurate except for the increase fees in Parking. Very helpful!
5,An unquiet mind of great understanding,"Kay Redfield Jamison is one of the world's leading experts on bipolar disorder. She has also written one of the finest personal accounts ""An Unquiet Mind"" of this particular way of being. Along with understanding and having known personally the devastating aspects of manic depression she too has understood the extraordinary powers which can come to those who suffer from such illness.She has in this regard written on Creativity and Depression, and on Exuberance (i.e. on that extraordinary upfeeling which seems to give some people a capacity for doing remarkable things in life).She is the rare example of one who has studied and to a degree mastered her own illness, and therefore has the capacity when she speaks to patients of hers to understand what they are saying in a way most cannot.She is an especially fine writer."
4,Interesting and somewhat informative,Great book for kindergarten and first graders. There are no photographs but the drawings are well done for the audience. This would also be a good book to read to smaller children to learn about dolphins and porpoises.
3,You can judge this book by its cover...,"This book is precisely what it claims to be -- a guide to the material tested on the exam.There is nothing in this book that will teach you how to design and structure an Access database, nor is there any detailed explanation of how the various functions and features within the user interface *work*.If you're already a proficient Access user, and you want to be sure that you know the ""right"" ways to do things for the test, or if you're a novice interested in faking it, this book will be helpful. It really does teach to the test, and the exam won't hold any surprises if you master the skills on the cheat sheets included with every chapter.Just don't confuse cramming for the exam with mastering the material."
5,Lovely flag!,"Great summer flag; very few people will recognize it as a ""BUddist flag""; but it is very colorful. We hung it out on our deck and it is lovely to watch in the breeze! The peaceful intent is nice too, and everyone asks about it. Just telling them what it is offers a way to remind people of the message of peace. Nice!"
5,Highly Recommended,"This is a well made printed flag, the Fly is sturdy and the colours will not fade easily. I use this primarily indoors for display in services while traveling."
3,Very thorough investigation of the managerial processes,"Try this exercise: think about the definition of the word ""management"" as you could find it in a common dictionary. OK ? Now EXTEND this definition to its most interesting and relevant details, complementing the words used by numerous diagrams, enough to fill exactly 600 pages. This is the book Professor Johnsen wrote.It is a complete work which comes as the result of 25 years of investigations on the topic.The book deserves at least 3 stars because it is well researched, relatively easy to read, and organized very systematically. No need to be a sociology expert to appreciate it, even if she/he might have added an extra star on its review."
2,Why I don't like MegaBloks,"The one thing i hate about megabloks is it takes so much to just put one piece together, but then they fall apart so easily, that is why i choose lego!"
3,24 Bit Re-Mastering Great-Songs Nothing New...,"The Songs seem to have been given new life with the 24-bit remastering, they are clear and distinct, even cranked up with headphones. The songs are no more than a Best Of Album, done much better with ""Still In Hollywood"" Which mixed in fresh Live performances, B Sides and unreleased great material.This CD is a must for Concrete Blonde Fans who want to hear their favorite songs in Crystal Clarity. Otherwise if you already have these songs on other CD's or best of Collections they are the same, just clearer...Keith S. :{)>"
5,Better Than Todays Shows,"This is one of the best old TV series. At least as far as 1950's 'cop and robber' shows went. And that says a lot because there were lots of them! I grew up watching them all (as fast as I could turn two channels - that's all we had). 'The Naked City' was good too, but the prices are still high on those. These are great bargains. And I like reality...and if I'm not mistaken...these are based on true stories."
4,racket squad,"The dvds were fun to watch. The quality is good. I enjoy watching old, black and white shows so these were good for me."
5,Terrific series!,"The ""See How they Grow"" series is very good. We own the whole series. My son enjoyed them all though preschool and elementary; learning all about animals and their lives. They are the step before the Eye Witness Videos (which are excellent!). Hope they continue to offer these as DVD's."
4,"Fast delivery but DVD was rattling inside, hope it's not scratched","Fast delivery and was exactly what I ordered, but the dvd holder inside is broken, so the dvd was rattling around. It's a present, so I really hope the dvd is not scratched."
5,very outstanding,Grand daughter love it and I was very happy with it.. I would buy more things from here as well
3,nice 'multi-layered' perspective on similar aspects of medic,"Providing multi-person perspectives on diverse aspects of medical education and practice, this book offers great insight into the beginnings of great doctors of our era. The only problem: these doctors are extraordinary, not-normal people. Their experiences may serve as motivation for some students, still they may give a false reassurance on a very dynamic and competitive field. Next time this book is written, normal, day to day doctors should also be interviewed. They also have extraordinary tales."
4,"Dated, but well written.","Some of the information in the book is dated and has changed by now, but all in all it's well written and still offers some useful insights on the different specialties and what they're like. The writers typically are positive about their specialties, so in some ways it may not offer a fully balanced perspective on the specialties."
4,Cute bag,I love the colors. BEACH. Straps were a little longer than I thought they would be. Worth the price!
5,Wonderful,GoHastings is a wonderful merchant. They are quick and efficient.I will continue to order from them because I know my DVD/Cd's will be arriving soon after I place my order.
5,Out of EDEN is out of this WORLD...,"As usual these girls bring it all! If you love Gospel R&B then get OUT OF EDEN's THIS IS YOUR LIFE as well as Virtue's latest ""Free"" and ""Kiss"" by Trin-i-tee 5:7.My favourite tracks include ALL YOU NEED, DIFFERENT NOW, THIS IS YOUR LIFE AND ROLLING STONE. This entire CD is worth the purchase, you WON'T be disapointed, go get it NOW!!This CD is packed with spiritual content, sweet beats and lovely ballards which make this a stand out project. Can't wait for the new CD to drop 2004"
5,OOE's best yet!!!,"I've been an Out of Eden fan from day one, no doubt. The first time I heard Lovely Day on the radio back many years ago (as a teen), I was beggin' my mom right away to hook me up. With the release of each new album you've been able to hear their style, vocal ability and lyrics develop and mature. I was pleased every time. But I have to say that this is their best yet. It's evident that Lisa Kimmey's been going through some things and God has been workin' in her life because this music is POWERFUL. I'm tellin' you, the first time I played these tracks I was either jammin' or in tears because this is life-changing stuff. The production name ""Deeply Rooted"" is so appropriate because this material is just that. If you're tired of the shallow stuff that's floating around in this industry, if you're looking for music to jam to and worship with at the same time pick up ""This is Your Life""!!!"
3,Catalyst,"Before I read ""Catalyst"" I read ""Speak"" and absolutely loved it. I think because I could relate to it so well and enjoyed it so much, I expected ""Catalyst"" to be the same. Though I didn't enjoy ""Catalyst"" as much as I had hoped, it was still a really great book. I think a lot of teenagers will be able to relate to the character of Kate and the issues that she deals with in her life. This book presents unique characters and different sorts of relationships between people. It's a good read and even if you don't love it, you'll still get something out of it."
4,Great,"First off, I am a lover of Laurie Halse Anderson so I can have no bad things to say bout her, nor her books. In her book Catalyst she takes us back to Merryweather High, the same setting as her book Speak. She talks about the life of a ministers daughter, Kate. The good, nice, friendly, and helpful Kate in the book is known as Good Kate and the rude, unhelpful, and even 'shameful' Kate is known as Bad Kate throughout the book.Bad Kate also thinks terrible thoughts of Terri Litch, the tremondously huge, scary girl who smokes cigrettes and is also in her grade at Merryweather High. Terri ends up staying at Kates house after her barn burns down and her house gets remodeled with the church funding. But Good Kate ends up having some sort of friendship and common understanding in the end, but I might be giving to much away."
2,begins well but then fizzles like a bad science experiment,"I bought ""catalyst"" because ""speak"" (by the same author) is one of my most favorite books. However, ""Catalyst"" is NOTHING like ""Speak"" and so readers should not be expect it to be. ""Catalyst"" is suppossed to be about a senior in high school on the verge of ""losing it"" due to a number of stressors, dissapointments, and pent-up emotions. Instead the book follows the stories of both the senior, Kate Malone, and a school outcast, Teri Litch. By the middle of the book it is not even clear who the story is more about, kate or teri. the most disapointing thing for me is that there is no catalyst for kate. It seems that her own problems and emotions are never confronted because her life suddenly changes when she is forced to deal with all of teri's life issues and problems."
1,Poor Young Adult literature,"This is a poorly written book for the targeted age group. This book is classified as 'young adult'. An adult is 18 and over so this is book is listed for readers 18-25 years old. The literary style is generally below that of that age group. However, the language and subject-matter is appropriate for that age group. Young adults should be able to appreciate and read Hemingway, Faulkner, Dickens. When compared to those, this is a poorly written book. As a literary style, it is more appropriate to 10-15 year olds, but the subject matter, and mostly the choice of language is not appropriate. If you want to write in an immatrue literary style and target an adolescent or pre-adolescent reader then the subject matter and choice of language should be more carefully crafted. Some young adult readers may be at this reading level given the type of books that make the NY Times bestseller lists so it is a fine book for those readers as a remedial book in order to learn to read."
4,Catalyst doesn't SPEAK to me,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson is my favorite book. Imagine my surprise when I found her newest book, Catalyst at the book store. And then the book is set at the same exact highschool as speak, with a cameo of Melinda. This is where the book goes wrong. This book is no speak.Had this ground breaking book not come before Catalyst, I may have liked Catalyst better. This book is like a hard working girl who does everything she can to find something she is best at, but is always overshadowed by her older sister.But lets not leave catalyst out of the running. It just has so much to live up to. Enough of my blather...Kate is that girl who is always at the top of her class. She has a caring boyfriend, supportive friends, her father is the family oriented reverend, but nothing really matters to her but getting into MIT, the school of her dreams...This is a good book, just not my favorite."
4,Catalyst,"This book is written in the perspective of a high school girl, Kate Malone, but I think readers of age 12 or older would enjoy it as well. Kate is an average girl with good grades and dreams of going to her college of choice. She lives with her father, the reverend, and her fourteen-year-old brother. Until a tragic event in her life that causes her rival, Teri Litch, to come live with her. Now, not only that she have to worry about MIT, which she been waiting for 93 days, but also Teri is in her home day and night. Laurie Anderson has beautifully written about the lives of these two girls with a twist that affect both of their lives for the best."
3,"Powerful, but not another ""Speak""....I'd say 3.5 stars","I loved ""Speak"" (if you haven't read it, get it now!) because it was so funny and dark and made me feel like Melinda was right there talking to me and me only. It had this intimacy that just makes a book so powerful. ""Catalyst"" lacks this intimacy, partially because it includes much more dialogue. Which is OK. Just don't expect quite the same style. I found the scientific term symbolism a bit sledgehammered, but maybe that's only because I'm taking chem now and I'm sick of it.The book moves so fast, I just kept wanting it to stop for a minute. I kind of like this. It made me feel like I was running to catch up with Kate. I predict this book won't be as big as Speak. For one thing, it has less sex and it's not as funny, important factors for most my age. I loved the ending, which is a big vague. I like vague endings; a lot of people don't.Catalyst is a powerful work, but it just wasn't as strong as Speak. It's still awesome, however."
4,Anderson does it again,"From Fever to Speak and now to Catalyst, Laurie Halse Anderson continues to amaze. This book is not speak, but it deals with the same issues. You get a book from a high school senior's perspective, so I definitely would not suggest it for younger than high school because of the strong sexual innuendo. Otherwise, I have nothing but praise for this book and Anderson's others. The writing may be choppy, but it is supposed to be Kate's thoughts. Most of the YA books seem to just be springboards for bringing up issues in the classroom, and Catalyst does that just fine. Speak is one of my favorites and that will be hard to top, but this book is still amazing."
3,Below Expectations,"This is about a high school senior who is placing all her hopes for the future on getting into MIT, but doesn't get in and is at a loss. Kate is an interesting character to watch develop. The dry humor and honest portrayal of high school make it enjoyable to read. It was also nice to see a protagonist with deeper thoughts than whether she would be asked to prom. If you have read the book ""Speak"" by the same author, don't expect the same from Catalyst; it doesn't measure up to Speak. I would recommend it, but it is probably not appropriate for anyone under 14."
2,Ehh...,"I didn't think this book was that good. Laurie Halse Anderson has written many better books than this one.I found the main character, Kate Malone, was unrelatable. Okay, it seems she has the perfect life, but I just got really tired of reading about what she was thinking. For some reason, she really annoyed me. I mean, how stupid is it to apply to just one college. Then, she kept dwelling on this subject the entire book. It seemed like throughout the entire book, Kate was obsessed about herself.I also found it annoying that she thought badly of her life. She had good grades, a great boyfriend, nice friends, and a great family. I just feel that throughout the whole book, Kate never realized much of what she had, and how she should be glad of what she has, compared to Tracy.Also, I think the book was pretty unexciting. (...)"
3,nicole's book!!,"This book was about a girl named Kate Malone. I liked the book because it was not predictable. The book was about this girl named Teri who is like a bully, but she is only a bully because she is getting picked on by other kids. Then her house burns down by a fire, so she moves in with Kate and her family and they are planning on to rebuild and remodel their house. But one day when they are eating lunch, they let Mikey go up and play in his new house. They thought that the door to his room was locked, but it seemed that it wasn't. So when they heard a loud scream coming from Mikey's room they were all wondering what happened. When they got up there they saw little Mikey lying on the floor dead. The open outlet electrocuted him and he died. It was so sad."
4,...,"Like Speak, Catalyst addresses the grittier side of teenage life, not the midterm you most definitely failed or the crush that is a complete jerk but the scenarios that can destroy your world or at least shake it up. I can't delve in too much into the story without giving it away but I will tell you Catalyst is not a light read but neither is it too dark. The characters, like real people, are not what they seem in the beginning and neither is the story. I know I started this story thinking I knew what I was getting into but then you hit the part, like the synopsis says, that blows it all apart and you finally see how things can be brought into perspective. Read the book, it definitely deserves it."
3,SENIOR LIFE,"This book started out a little confusing. While reading it, it was hard to understand, mostly because it was coming from a seniors point of view and I haven't had to look for colleges yet. Once through the beginning, the book improved. I liked the way the book's form and the way it was like a diary/journal getting you into the mind of the main character. I liked that in the book there were surprises and that you couldn't pick out what happened or what was about to happen. Over all, I thought the book was pretty good, and i would recommend reading it if you like journals, and getting into the mind of someone whose life seems like it really sucks."
5,Comes at you like Teri's sledgehammer,"Apparently some readers have trouble relating to Kate and/or Teri. I did not. I love them both. Could not put the book down and read until 2 am, then lay awake after that. Don't know why some readers got bored. I found it pretty savage.Maybe it's because I was a nerdy, have-to-get-into-the-right-college, type A teen myself. It took a long time to understand the lessons Kate learns."
5,Great book!,I never expected what happened! i love laurie halse anderson and thought this book was written very well. i would definitely reccomend it!
2,Disappointed in Catalyst,"The main issue with this novel is that Anderson attempts to cover far, far too many motifs. Without giving too much away, this book reflects a halfhearted effort in exploring social and academic pressure, religion, parental issues, death, domestic abuse, teenage pregnancy, stress and overexertion, friendship, lust versus love, and much more. I believe that Anderson is a talented writer; however, her talent is spread too thin in this book. It's just impossible to cover that much in such a short novel. Because of this, the plot is scattered and chaotic. A single, major theme never emerges. It starts out focusing on academic pressure and perfectionism, but the plot soon meanders away. The novel leaves too many unanswered questions and loose ends."
3,Not worth reading,"In my opinion, this book is a downer! So depressing, and not in a good way either. I would honestly suggest you not read this unless you are amid a 14 hour car ride. Which, unfortunately, I was not. As Franz Kafka once said,"" a book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside of us."" Those are the books we shoud fill our minds with, not with the words in catalyst. I was very dissapointed in Anderson, because I worshipped Twisted, and Wintergirls, but this book was the polar oppisate. Remember. This book would be found entertaining at the dentist office."
3,"Good, bad, sad, a little boring","Kate Malone is a straight A student, ministers daughter, and all she's wanted since she was in 4th grade is to get in to MIT but when she is turned down her life starts falling apart. Especially when, after a devastating fire, her father invites Kate's polar opposite Teri Litch to move into Kate's room... ""Catalyst"" starts funny and then becomes sad, but still keeps a witty edge so it's not too serious but not what I would call a purely funny book either. I can't say I loved this book but I did enjoy it to a certain extent. Good, bad, sad and a little boring but over all, good."
3,Catalyst,"Technically this book is alright, but it seems to be missing something. It starts off slow as you get a peek into Kate's hectic life. Kate has an obsession with school work and getting things done. She is trying to live this ""perfect"" life when her enemy, Teri, moves in with her. It has a slow and sometimes dull start but after something tragic happens, her world falls apart. I liked the climax of the story but I wish I could say the same for the ending. It's not realistic and was pretty rushed.If your a high school student going off to college, I recommend you read this. Don't read it if you're looking for a sequal to Speak, they're barely similar."
2,Could be better,"Before I bought this, I made sure to read reviews and to follow the directions not only from reviews, but the ones that came with the shaver. After all that research, this product didn't work well for me. Trying to see if I can return it."
3,Body Bare Personal Area Shaver,My 'Body Bare Personal Area Shaver' arrived on time. I simply ordered this in a season that I still have not used it. I hope to do so soon. Really a nice looking product.
3,Just ok,It works ok but only if the stubble is sticking up. I will not risk any health issues with applying powder to my lady parts though so it may work better if you are willing to do so.
1,Horrible merchant dont deal with him,"I wrote to the merchant saying that the product is defective.. The merchants response was ""You are a liar and you want a free product."
2,Not a good shave,I followed the directions to a T and didn't have good results. The shave wasn't close. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it at several different hair lengths to see what worked best and wasn't happy with any of the results. This is not a good substitute for a razor.
1,Total crap,"Remember back in the 80s there were these sweater shavers that could make your sweaters new again by shaving off all the little laundry fuzzballs after you pulled them out of the washer or dryer? This is EXACTLY like that, but with smaller holes. The holes are so dang small I couldn't get any hair shaved. This didn't even work for shaving the peach fuzz on my face. I don't care what the other reviewer said about 'delicate areas' because he obviously was too dumb to realize nothing got shaved. This was a total rip off. I wish I had time to return it, but life got in the way and it was too late to return it when I had the time."
3,Body Bare with rechargable battery,"I bought this product with skepticism...The first time I used it, I got nicked in several places and started to bleed (despite the product advertising it's cut-free abilities)The product only trimmed in certain places, leaving a patchy appearance...where it did trim is very smooth and wonderful, and where it didn't trim looks ugly and feels scratchy.It's easy to clean, easy to charge, and comes packaged well, but I would not recommend this product to anyone looking to trim very course hair. The trimmer worked wonders on thinner hair, however on thicker hair the trimmer really disappointed me.The trimmer makes a light buzzing noise, and is fairly quiet."
1,Dont waste your money,I am very disappointed with this product. I read all of the instructions & followed them step by step. The product didn't perform as advertised. The shaver left spotty patches & the areas that it did shave were not as close as I like it. I had to use a razor to finish the job. I returned the product but still had to pay for shipping.
2,Not a close shave,"If I want a close shave, I reach for the razor in the shower. If I don't have time for a shower, this product is fine. I have received a couple of nicks though. It's really easy to use & I have never had trouble with the battery holding a charge. I'm not dissatisfied enough to return it though."
2,Dissapointed,"It didn't shave as close as it claimed, even though I used it on ""stubble"". I had to shave with my usual razor afterwards to make it as smooth as I like, so I don't feel it was worth the price."
5,On Talon of Light,"An engrossing fantasy with some unexpected twists and turns that make it all the more enjoyable. there are things here that don't happen in most fantasies--an ancient prophecy which is out-of-joint, a reformed villain...and a hero who is NOT the first to receive the magic sword...Characterisation is exacting and well-built, and there are plenty of dragons for the dragon-lover."
5,an exciting tale of good and evil,I fell in love with the characters as the story unfolded and enjoyed the strong moral values it contains. I love this story and the civilization the author has created. You won't be disappointed in reading this book. I highly recommend!
4,'ta Bueno...,"Este disco no es igual a los otros (de hecho 4 estrellas en vez de 5). Sin embargo, como siempre, El Gran Silencio te hacen mover.La mezcla de sonidos y tipos de musica es algo que me gusta bastante."
5,Tasty and fruity,"This is a tasty jam and a good find for those of us who want to avoid sugar. It tastes distinctly fruity, more so in fact than other sugary jams and has no fake sweeteners and thus no nasty aftertaste. It's a staple in my house."
4,Great exercise routine,The workouts provide a cheerful environment and really works your middle. I got my item as described. It was NEW and fine. Recommend this product for exercise-goers.
5,Work out with Kathy,Love this DVD; Kathy really works your butt. And she not as annoying as Denise Austin.
3,Kathy Smith,This is a good DVD but doesn't offer a lot of challenge for me. I'm using this one with her Pilates. I'm a real beginner with Pilates. The pilates DVD is more difficult for me so I welcome the tummy exercises afterwards. Great pair when used together.
4,So fun!,This workout DVD is super fun. There's 10-minute workouts and there's no pressure to workout for long periods of time. I like that there's low to moderate impact workouts.
3,"Not bad, but wife doesn't dig it","I got this for my wife. Her other workout videos were getting a little repetitive, so she wanted me to find something to help her switch things up. Unfortunately she didn't really like Kathy's style of instruction. My wife likes a personal, more concentrated workout experience, but she felt Kathy was a bit too hyper and peppy at time for her taste.Personally, I don't think she gave it enough of a chance, but no need in working out to a video you can't warm up to.To compare, she has been using Jin Miller's Kettle-bell workout for a couple of years now."
4,No Choice But Freedom,"No Choice But Freedom is a wonderful historical piece dealing with the issues of slavery and a women's right to voice her opinion on the subject during a time when it was not appropriate to do so. A well-to-do English woman makes a journey by ship to colonial America to be with her husband, who is unfaithful and has his own reasons for the marriage. She soon finds that life in the colonies is not what she is used to in England, but prevails when faced with the unexpected challenges. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Historical Fiction, Women's Literature, or Slavery in early America."
5,Classic early B.B.,"B.B. King is known for his MCA/ABC Bluesways years. But, before there was the legendary B.B., there was the EMI B.B. that made 1950s-like blues. Those blues sides are documented here on 2003's 'Classic Masters.'The title could be misleading to some of you. This set does not contain any of his MCA (now Geffen) classic sides. This set focuses on what made B.B. the legend that he is today. Both parts of 'Sweet Sixteen,' 'Every Day I Have the Blues,' 'Three O' Clock Blues' and nine other classic early B.B. sides are just essential.And, EMI get extra pointers for remastering this. The sound quality is superb!Overall, if you like B.B.'s MCA material, don't ignore his early EMI years. This is a set you should not ignore if you like B.B. King.Highly recommended for any B.B. fan. A great set. ENJOY!!!"
2,unimpressed,"I'm not exactly a twenty something fashionista, but wow are the patterns in here dumpy. There have been a couple of OK technique articles, but three issues into my subscription I haven't gotten much from it. Many of the articles are rambling pointless nostalgia and many of the patterns are for striped v neck sweater vests. It's so hard to get new information on knitting machines now that it's sad one of the few remaining sources concentrates on shapeless granny sweaters in cheap acrylic. Knitting machines are capable of so much, why are they always presented in this light?"
3,less than stylish,"I took this subscription for a year. I was disappointed in the projects as they were not very imaginative. The articles were sometimes interesting, but I did not make one of the patterns during the whole year. (I make at least 2-3 garments every month on the machine) However, it is the only publication that I know that is in the style of sleek paper and color, so I will probably subscribe again. I did find a penpal through the magazine that I have enjoyed corresponding with regarding machine knitting."
1,Very Disappointing,"Great DVD but was very disappointing in that it is the same as Kathy Smith's DVD Matrix Method-Ultimate Sculpt. If you have already bought one, save your money and do not buy the other. [ASIN:B000WOSAV0 Kathy Smith: Build Muscle Shrink Fat]."
4,good workout,"I really enjoy this workout. I have seen some good results, it's not too complicated or crazy, doesn't require too much equipment, and can be modified for varying fitness levels. Unfortunately, my copy sticks, which is frustrating, but it was not expensive. I actually rented it from Netflix before I purchased it, so I was confident about the workout before I bought."
1,amazon should advertise as re-release,"I am very disappointed that amazon does not have this product listed as a re-release. I am a huge kathy smith fan and have many of her dvd's. I was so excited to see the 3 new dvd's listed for release on dec 18th and ordered 2 of them. In getting the package at home and going to do the workout today I realized that it was a re-release of ultimate sculpt. I went directly to the kathy smith website to email her contact people and see that her website has clearly stated that this is a re-release. I blame amazon for not advertising this correctly. The original dvd is great, I love it, so for those of you who don't have it yet, this will be a great workout. It is very complete and makes you feel like you have covered working out all body part as well as cardio. Shame on Amazon though!!!!!"
3,Build Muscle and Shrink Fat,I found this dvd to be pretty intense especially on your knees. It is a great workout for those who are young and have no joint issues. I have Kathy Smith's Project You (first dvd) and love it!
3,Not Great,This workout makes my knees hurt every time I do it. I was dissapointed in the overall variety. Lots of bouncing and lunges.
1,Don't Waste Your TIME Reading this Series...,"Okay, I also admit was very irritated by Chapter 4 of Lee's lip stutter or idiotic word faux pas... and then was even more disappointed in a poorly written mystery plot. This is no mystery genre for mystery fans... but a thinly disguised story marketed for those who like to read ""fluff"" and nonsense. This is a well-known writer of OTHER books?? Good grief."
4,Chocolate and murder,"Lee McKinney is the business manager of her aunt's chocolate business TenHuis Chocolade in Warner Pier, Michigan. Lee is a bit skeptical when flashy Aubrey Andrews Armstrong sweeps into town claiming he wants to produce a movie based on a local author's romance novel. And he wants to film it on location. Most of the locals don't think the book was that good, so this just fuels Lee's suspicions of him.Then Aunt Nettie starts going out with Aubrey. Joe is trying to get Lee to help him redecorate his apartment in the hopes that they will soon marry. Life is getting very confusing.Lee gets even more suspicious of Aubrey when she stumbles over a dead body. Can Lee unravel the mystery and find out more information about Aubrey without ending up dead?This was the first book I've read by this author. It won't be the last. I really enjoyed the characters and the setting. I look forward to reading many more escapades with Lee. I highly recommend this book."
3,Decent Series,"As with all the other books in this series, this installment was cute, and a light, easy read.However, Lee's ""tongue-tangling"" gets stupider and more annoying with each book. The ""tangles"" make no sense at all and aren't even remotely amusing -- which means they just grate on your nerves as your eyes skim the words and your brain realizes it has no idea what on earth you just read. I really wish the author would kill this idiotic gimmick, which would allow me to rate these books with at least one more star than I normally do."
5,Comprehensive study of Peruvian Pasos,"Everything you ever wanted to know about this breed of horse written by a man with 50 years experience with the Peruvian Paso. This book was translated from the original which was printed in Peru. Chapters are Origin of the horse, The horse in Spain, The horse in Peru, breed characteristics and parts of the horse, the horse in motion, reproduction and breeding, the training, feeding, the qualifications and judging, The sub-types, the horse in agriculture and stock breeding, the donkey and equine hybrids, Health care and diseases of the horse, traditional Peruvian saddle and tack, the attire of the chalan, memories of yesterday, promotion in the country, advances, laws and decrees, facilities, glossary of Peruvian words, and bibliography. Written in an easy to understand style with lots of illustrations, some color pictures and lots of black and white photos. A lifetime of knowledge is presented here."
5,Back to the 70's,Hearing Cornelius Brothers and Sister Rose took me back to the early 70's. I had their 8 track tape and loved it. I purchased the CD and it's wonderful listening to their music again! This is a must have album if you want to take a trip back to the 70's!!!
1,Attention Stores: PULL FROM YOUR SHELVES!!!,"I am disappointed in all the stores that even sell this product. My 3 year old wanted a digital camera so she could take some pictures to send to her dad, who is in the Army overseas right now, and so she spent her christmas money on this and she might as well have just thrown her money in the trash can. At first I was upset that there is no flash on this camera, even though the pictures on the package make it look like it flashes. Finally my computer had a problem downloading the software... once I fixed that I got the pictures to download and the pictures are horrible. I took pictures of my daughter and everything looks like dark fuzz. I went into rooms with better lighting, and the objects in the pictures still look like fuzz. Finally after continuous attempts to get better pictures, the software now locks up my computer!! I work with computers and digi cams often, the problem isn't a lack of knowledge in consumers."
1,Horrible Pictures,"This camera takes horrible pictures. We gave one to our daughter for Christmas and now she is heart broken that the camera doesn't work. We have tried taking pictures in all different types of settings and nothing works. I know it is an inexpensive camera, but I would at least expect to see some of the pictures come out... none of them did. Very sad daughter, very unhappy parents!"
1,"If You Buy It, You Will Be Returning It","I think this is a good idea for a product, and the software worked ok for us, but all of our pictures came out blurry. It also has no flash, and no screen for viewing your photos. So it is zero fun for a child. They can have the same amount of fun with a fake camera that clicks, since the pictures this product takes have no value. I think the manufacturer is just hoping that people are too lazy to return it, or lose the receipt."
2,"Fun, but you can spend your money better elsewhere","I bought this for my dd's 6th birthday - I set it so that it only took a few pictures, that were supposed to be Higher Resolution. Seems to have worked fine - I didnt' download the enclosed software - as many of the other reviews (blue camera) mentioned problems with the software either crashing their computer or not working properly. For 4-6 yo's - it seems to be a fine camera - but any older - get a cheap Fuji digital and let them have a flash, and decent pictures."
1,don't waste your money,I bought 2 of these for my kids and it takes the worst pictures EVER!!!! Don't waste your money. We ended up giving them our first digital camera from 5 years ago and it works 100x better.
1,Useless product,My son used this camera for one day. It was the biggest waste of money. You are better off buying a disposable camera and getting the pictures put on a cd for your child to edit.
1,Frustrating and useless!,"My son received this for his birthday and was very excited at first. However, with no screen on the camera we didn't know what he was getting pictures of. Also, the different settings for high/low density and resolution were very confusing, and we couldn't figure out what setting we were on or how many more pictures we could take. When we downloaded his pictures we discovered most of the pictures had somehow been erased! After a while the camera stopped working altogether. We did return this for a refund. Don't waste your money or time on this ""camera""!"
4,Beautiful Rendition of Poison Ivy,"This rendition of Poison Ivy is an exremely beautiful piece. She is very well painted, and is a visually stunning piece. My only complaint with this, and the reason i only gave it four stars instead of five, is that her feet don't fit well into the slots on the base. Both of her feet have slots on the base they are supposed to fit into, however, they are not spaced right. I was not able to get both feet in both slots, so i have one foot in, and the other is just balancing. However, she does stand up well and this minor problem is not a big enough reason to me to pass up this exquisite figure."
4,A Good Jance Read,I have read all of Jance's Arizona novels but only a few of the Seattle ones. I like Beaumont. A key component of this novel is information retrieved through hypnotism. I am a little skeptical of what can be accomplished that way. Otherwise there are a lot of interesting characters and a couple of stroy threads. A good read!
5,Riveting,"I do a lot of reading and I love James Patterson's books but when I found J.A. Jance's books I thought I would give them a try and I have to admit she is the female version of James Patterson. Her books keep you in suspense and have you reading until you get to the end. So far I have gotten the whole J.P. Beaumont series and they are all have you wondering ""what's going to happen next."" I would recommend her books to anyone that loves to read. Believe me you won't be disappointed, they are one of the best fiction novels I've read in a long time.Linda"
4,Glad to see J.P. Beaumont back!,"By far my favorite JA Jance books feature J.P. Beaumont. I enjoy her other series, but not nearly as much. This particular book was good, but not quite as tightly written as the earlier J.P. Beaumont titles, such as Until Proven Guilty, Injustice for All, or Trial by Fury. It still grips you in the continuing story of Beaumont's life, and makes you want to hear what happens to him next...and also, of course, what new case he gets involved in solving. It is definitely worth the read."
2,Found it boring..,"Sorry...this was the first time I have read any of her books and I thought it was terrible. I purchased based on the other reviews, but I did not find the characters very engaging, the story line dragged and overall I found it extremely difficult to read through to the end. Will not try her books again and will stick to Patterson, etc."
5,A real page turner!,"I'm not much of a mystery novel fan but Jance's work is a major exception. I've eagerly awaited each new J.P. Beaumont book for years. This one's probably the best of the whole series! The characterization is smooth and even the minor characters are interesting and believable. I really like how the author blends current events and an intimate knowledge of the Puget Sound region with her fictional characters and proceedings to create a compelling and credible mystery. You can really emphasize with Beau's pain as his friend Ron Peter's family is torn apart by marital strife and murder. Recovered memories at the heart of the work are fascinating and convincing written. The plot is very complex, blending two intertwined but separate mysteries, yet gripping and easy to read. This is a very entertaining, highly recommended book. I enjoyed it a lot!"
2,Long Time Gone: A novel of Suspence??,"I was very disappointed with J.A. Jance's ""Long Time Gone"". I have read all of her books and this one spent the first 200 pages taking about people from past books. I guess, if you have not read any of the past JP Beaumont books this helped you understand the Mysteries. I kept thinking that Jance, was just trying to put out a fast book."
4,Latest J.P. Beaumont Title Still Pleases,"J.A Jance is a veteran mystery writer. One of her main mystery lines stars Seattle/Washington State Homicide Detective J.P. ""Beau"" Beaumont. This latest title has intertwinning plot lines that keep the action moving and the reader turning pages. Beau's character, as in all the books, continues to be developing. Enjoy."
5,quick fun easy reading,I am always surprised that J.A. Jance is able to come up with new mystery's really enjoyed reading and sorrythat I am now at the end of the series for the time being.
3,Great book but the wrong narrator,"Stongly recommend that listeners of any J P Beaumont book find the Gene Engene version of the audio books. I rate J A Jance's novel as a 5, but this narrator brings it down to a 3 or even lower."
4,unique,"At first I didn't like this CD, but after some trees and a 40 oz of 211, I found out how tight it really is. Very orginial, you gotta listen to it bent to appreciate the quaility on this here work of art. I'm smoked out, is ya?"
5,Air leak in trigger?,Quick and easy repair. All the tool included that you need except for maybe a hammer to knock the pin out.
2,Poor Quality Control,"When I replaced the trigger valve the gun continued to leak around the trigger. I called Bostitch and was referred to their repair facility. The gentlemen there told me to remove the trigger valve O rings and heavily lube the O ring recesses replace the O rings and reinstall the valve.I follow his advice and reinstalled the trigger. However, air still leaded from the trigger. So, I called the technician back and he said that sometime when he replaces the trigger it leaks and he installs another trigger.So, I call Bostitch customer service and complained, they sent me a new valve but I still have a small leak. But at least my compressor will hold pressure long enough to allow me to use the tool. But, the compressor cycles on and off frequently."
5,it worked,I had a leak in the trigger and after extensive researh figured out it was the trigger that needed replacing.
1,Scratched up cd,"When I got this cd and played it, it was already scrached up, I tryed playing it and a few songs wouldnyt even play"
3,Same Old Stuff,"First let me say this: If you are a new ""Freelancing for Dummies"" will be helpful in putting you on path to getting published. But I do wish the author had put MORE into it, in terms of material that hasn't been seen elsewhere.I also find the author to be overly optimistic, and writing from the viewpoint of someone who has dipped in and out of the profession, and most likely has an alternate means of support. Then, too, the author tries to cover too much, and leaves this reader wondering whether she is addressing those new to writing for publication, or published writers who want to take a shot at writing for a living. (To be fair to Ms. Drake, one or more editors may have had too heavy a hand in the mix.)The bottom line: Don't ignore this title, but if you've read more than one other book for beginning freelancers you may do better to pick up some books for more advanced writers, and/or genre- or field-specific writing."
1,Feed Me My Refund!!!,"This was the worst PPV in the WWE history recorded. We all thought we were getting a Hell in a Cell match? All year the WWE Universe waiting for Hell in a Cell and wait do we get instead, a -100 out of 5 show. Just one, but big Cell match we all wanted to see, but you gave us NOTHING!!! A stupid Cell match lasting under 10 mins and having Punk using a self-hired referee! A referee using low-blow to Ryback, Punk doing a roll-up, a referee holding both of Ryback's legs, and making a fast count all in that order. I want my damn refund! Fire the referee and strip or fire Punk for this! You think Punk needs to earn respect? How about you now WWE! Shame on you!!!"
3,Not a bad CD.,"This CD may have some nice tunes in it but I must tell you, this CD is pretty much commercialized for electronica newbies. The problem with this album and the rest of the others that was made by Water Music is that almost all of the tracks end by applying the fade out effect while the music is still going. Especially with the Nu Breed remix of the Born Too Slow. I went and researched and found out the original tracks are way longer than the ones on this album. This CD is not really bad at all. At least I did not spend $20 on this one."
5,frisbeemessiah,Blind melon is awesome. Even though there is no new stuff it is still amazing. If you havent heard them before you really should get this. It's a best of kinda deal.
3,Back Scratcher Review,"It is an alright back scratcher. Nothing to write home about, but it does get the job done."
1,It came broken,"This item arrived broken yesterday afternoon. The head is separated from the handle. I keep putting it on and it keeps coming off. I'll try supergluing it, I guess. That's pretty crummy for a $10 backscratcher!!!"
5,The ONLY backscratcher that really works!,"These Max Scratch back scratchers are great and make wonderful gifts. The head of the scratcher is composed of short molded plastic ""bristles"" and the handle is slightly flexible. You can get a good scratching, from very light to a lot of pressure because the handle won't let you dig in deep enough to break skin. This works so much better than any metal scracher out there. And the many little bristles do the job so much better than fingers. Everybody I've given these to as gifts have been astonished by how well they work and just love them."
1,it's just not very interesting,"After reading ""The Debt to Pleasure"" I was eagerly anticipating Lanchester new book. Well, don't rush out and buy it. This book is boring, trite and mercifully short. The main character, Mr. Phillips, is uninteresting. I never felt any empathy towards him and if the book had been any longer I probably wouldn't have bothered to finish it. Mr. Phillips' mind is on sex a large part of the time, unfortunately, even that's not interesting. There are too many (old) lightbulb jokes ""How many ... does it take ..."" and British jokes which should have been edited out. I wouldn't say the book needed a better editor, it's just not substantial enough to be in print. Read ""The Mezzanine"", now there's a fabulous book about nothing!"
5,The post - modern man,"In Mr. Phillips, John Lanchester has created not only a bitter-sweet chronical of middle-aged suburbia, but also a psychological study of the existentialist nightmare. For the coffee-table reader there are plenty of pleasing encounters covering all the major socio-literary themes of our time, but don't be deceived, these are not merely to tease and please. By all means chortle at the unfortunate antics to befall the eponymous Mr. Phillips and then enjoy reflecting on the wider social implications of this clever and witty novel."
4,A Day In The Life...,"The novel that John Lanchester has devised is an interesting snapshot of a man's life after he has been made redundant, yet he's afraid to tell his family and thus goes through the motions of going to work only to wander around London all day. Lanchester has done a wonderful job of making Mr. Phillips a unique and complete character. At times, however, Mr. Phillips thinks to much and the narrative can get slightly tedious. All-in-all, Mr. Phillips is a joy to read."
3,"Shlub City, here we come","I still haven't gotten around to MRS DALLOWAY. (I'm too busy debating particle physics with Jeanette Winterson via her ouija board.) As far as I can tell, MR PHILLIPS is the fictional equivalent of the desultory ""observational humor"" that stand-up comedians do. (The stand-up material that invariably gets introduced with the phrase ""Have you ever noticed that...?"".) The main difference between this and THE DEBT TO PLEASURE seems to be that PLEASURE'S recipes have been replaced with tedious statistical calculations and sexual disquisitions.Here's my fave line: ""Karen's accent, East London verging on Essex, is sexy too, but in a more straightforwardly sluttish way. And there is something about the limitless reserves of indifference she can express, the thrilling estuarine boredness of her 'Yeah'."""
4,mr phillips,"the book is fine and was deliverd to me just.. the book was covered with what looks like two brown paper bags and my name and address,looks like a childs hand writing it was taped but open when i pulled out of my mail box,i laugh when i look at the wrapping. its all good......."
3,Not quite what I was looking for...,"I was a little disappointed in the translation itself, having read different versions of some of these poems and also there is a certain amount of vulgar language, (words I can't repeat in a review even). I don't know what words they used in the original Japanese, but had I know what was used here, I'd have bought an older translation from a more genteel generation... ;)Here is an example of the differences in translators. From this book we have,""Weathered boneson my minda wind pierced body.""But here is the more elegant and thoughtful Penguin Classics translation by Nobuyuki Yuasa,""Determined to fallA weather-exposed skeletonI cannot help the sore windBlowing through my heart."""
3,ok,"Received the book quickly-looks like it has been kicking around for a while.. some dents and scratches in soft cover-definitely NOT like new. Book was written in-on page 42; the book's previous owner wrote: ""a little water falls"" in blue pen.My intent was to give the book as a gift- will keep this one -as a result I bought a new one for my gift giving."
5,absolutely magick-al,"This is a breathtaking book that should be read by anyone with an interest in magick, fantasy, Ireland, or the craft of writing. It is a bit confusing at first, because there are three different stories going on at once, but as soon as you catch on, you're just taken aback by the complexity and juxtaposition Melling has been able to weave between these worlds of fiction, fantasy, and ""reality."" I am always (I've read this book at least 7 times) especially impressed with the passages about the writer character, and how she has become entagled in her own characters lives. It's oh-so true!"
4,Beautiful film,"A visually gorgeous film, gently paced. My high school juniors enjoyed watching it -- but I did not show the whole film, though I recommend it highly. In particular, students were rapt during the scene when Keats and Fanny recite La Belle Dame Sans Merci to one another. That scene alone was worth the purchase of the DVD."
4,Beautiful but of course sad,Very well acted. I love how this movie looks at the relationship of a consummate artist with a non-artist. That it's most important inspiration.
3,bright star,I was disappointed in this movie overall even though there was good acting. I felt there was not enough character development in the story to really get into the three main characters.
3,Campion rehabilitates Fanny,"Like all Jane Campion films, a bit precious but still with lovely bits. Cornish's performance suggests a more controlled and intelligent Fanny than the one that resides in my memory from Keats's letters and the biographies. Aside from his size, Ben Wishaw isn't at all the way I imagined Keats, though his voice is quite lovely. A touching and beautiful film in spots...however, I have to say I was disappointed not to have more of Keats. I didn't like the sense I had that he was more or less carried about on the tides of others' wills."
5,love it,Moving story that is beautifully done from beginning to end. Even my man enjoyed watching this film. Love it! It is in my top ten favorite movies ever.
3,Chick Flick,"Based on a true story- I ordered this because I wanted to see the story of the ailing poet in love, but I had to watch it along because DH wasn't interested. Good acting- interesting story- definitely a niche film."
1,RENT IT FIRST.,"i really love period pieces and historcal dramas, so i thought that a story about the life of john keats would be great for me. I hated this movie. First, there was no background music AT ALL, and I dont know about you, but I feel like music is crutial for a movie expected to convey such deep, raw emotion. As i was watching the characters on screen i really wanted to connect with them and feel their passion for each other, but I felt nothing. I didn't care when john died. Yeah, I said it--HE DIES. The dialogue doesn't let you into the minds of the characters, and honestly i do not care or feel for them at all. It just seems to drawl on and on and on, and im sad to say that i was relieved when it was over. I had expectations for this one. Now im just stuck with this damn dvd. I never want to see this movie again...Oh, and Ben Wishaw does NOT know how to kiss."
2,Lost Opportunity to Create A Great Film on Keats!,"This movie started out fine, but then deteriorated into a mere flow of tasteful frames, shots, or takes. A film is not merely an exercise in beautiful cinematography. It lost its drive, logic, meaningfulness, and intensity as a portrait of Keats and his relationship with Fanny. I don't understand why the director decided to cast amateurs in the important roles for this film. I am sorry that Jane Campion lost a precious opportunity to create a masterly film on Keats."
2,Romance,"This movie (Bright star) is fantastic: director, actors, imagines, music are very good.It's a real love story ... I hope J. Keats and F. Brawne could see last Jane Campion's movie, wherewer they are at the moment ..."
3,not the best used,"the dvd was filthy dirty, smelled like smoke and grease, lots of scratched on disc, i just hope its going to play without interuption"
3,A bit slow,"I watch alot of BBC productions and this was by far not my favorite. It moves slow and I couldn't get into the characters. I could care less if John Keats found true love or not, wrote great poetry or not, or if he passed away completely unknown. I enjoy period films and history, but couldn't enjoy this one."
3,Not my favorite,"This movie struck me as rushed, dull, and poorly acted. I don't know if this was supposed to be a true story, but it didn't ring as authentic. I also felt it was too predictable.If you want to cozy up with a romantic movie, try ""Our Mutual Friend"" or ""Pride and Prejudice""."
2,"Everyone told me they loved it, I didn't.","I am a big fan of movies like Pride and Prejudice and The Importance of Being Earnest. I kept hearing this was a winner, but I thought it was SAD and will not be recommending it to friends."
2,Horrific ordeal to watch,"Slow, soporific and so dead it was practically decomposing, this movie was an unbearable punishment to sit through, and a misery so profound that it compelled me to rededicate my life to Christ, out of fear that Hell would be playing an endless loop of this sadistic torture. It gets a 2nd star for very beautiful costumes and scenery. Everything else should not be spoken of. The Horror. The Horror."
2,Very disappointing,"I am a fan of Jane Campion's work. However, I was greatly disappointed by this film. The chemistry between the two main actors, Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw, was very weak. The way that Fanny Brawne is portrayed makes her seem like a conceited, vain diva who thought mainly of her own emotions. Keats is portrayed as a rather spineless fellow. Frankly, Bright Star's depiction of the romance between Keats and Brawne is so shallow, navel-gazing and overly dramatic that it was akin to watching two teenagers who are at the apex of happiness one moment and in the depths of despair the next."
4,Touching,"A touching romance about poet John Keats and his muse Fanny Brawne. Although some parts are a bit slow, there are also scenes of intense feeling and violent emotion. Has certainly made me want to learn more about this star-crossed couple."
4,cute,"cute pillow, kinda boxy and more orangy than expected, but nice and soft, my son really enjoys it"
3,Lightning McQueen pillow,"The pillow was more orange than red and appeared faded. Therefore, it does not match all the other things we have that are a vivid red."
2,No variation for the less experienced.,"I purchased this DVD because I liked the 5 short workouts-- so I could do as many as I wanted in one sitting. I am not very in shape...as i just had a baby 6 months ago, but I have been working super hard to get my abs back.Another review said that there are variations on the workouts so a beginner could do it... Not so... I AM a beginner, and there were a couple workouts that I just had to ff though... I couldnt do the move and i couldnt think of how to alter it, so I could at least try to work up to it.The only reason this got 2 stars, is because I like the trainers personalities.Each workout starts with the trainers talking about their workout... too much time between each workout with gibberish...and then the workouts went so fast (as in tempo) that i couldnt keep up.The strangest thing about each section, is each trainer put in a plug for Propel Fitness Water... so weird...Pass on this one...find something else."
1,made in China :-(,"(June 2012) Maybe these used to be made in the USA (an online search indicates this), BUT the product I received specifies that they are MADE IN CHINA. ** sigh **"
1,Not Usable,"I've planned a summer-long tour of the northwest USA via RV and motorcycle. One of the 'must do' items is to check MC tire pressures regularly. My bike needs a flexible connection to ensure a solid connection to the tire valve. That's why I ordered this tire gauge. Unfortunately the gauge arrived with the needle on the wrong side of the zero peg, thus rendering the entire gauge unusable. Additionally there was no way to take the gauge apart to remedy the problem.Based on that problem I cannot recommend this gauge."
2,In the beginning. . .,"Rather amazing isn't it that the powers-that-be have made this available on cd while ""The Envoy"" and ""Stand In The Fire"" have never been released on cd, and ""Mr. Bad Example"" and ""Transverse City"" are now out of print. Oh, well. We Zevon fanatics will have to take what we can get.Unfortunately, Warren's humble beginnings were just that. There is not a lot of truly memorable music on this one. ""She Quit Me"" is a hard blues number, interesting mostly because of its appearance in the film ""Midnight Cowboy"" (not Warren's version). ""A Bullet For Ramona"" offers a glimpse of the brilliantly deranged music to come, and one of these songs (""Gorilla""?) contains the riff that would later become ""Jungle Work"".If you are new to Zevon, do not start here. This is a curio for fans like me who just can't get enough."
2,"Hard to listen to, but not worthless","Most fans of Warren Zevon probably know that he would have been just as happy if this album dissappeared from the face of the earth completely. I can sort of see why, although it is a rather, uh, interesting listen. The most annoying thing about this album is the way he uses his voice. While he does have that familiar deep rich voice Zevon fans know and love, he sings with vibrato way more than he should, making him sound as if he had been cross bred with Joan Baez (actually put your Joan Baez albums on the turntable and turn the pitch as flat as it could go, and you would have a pretty good idea of what to expect from ""Wanted Dead Or Alive.""). Only for the curious and completists."
2,There's a reason Warren Zevon disowned this.,"And it is because ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" is an album of an artist still defining himself. ""Bullet For Ramona,"" for example, was carried from the Lyme and Cybelle sessions (see the ""First Sessions"" CD) and was given yet another reworking before it wound up in the ""Midnight Cowboy"" movie. There's even a song called ""Gorilla,"" which hints at a favorite topic of WZ's (think ""Gorilla You're a Desperado"" or ""Leave My Monkey Alone""), the animal traits we hide in ourselves.But like John Mellencamp's ""Chestnut Street Incident,"" ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" trapped an artist with a record he probably wishes he could scorch from the face of the planet. Not that it's bad, just that it's a poor representation of who Warren Zevon, in another five or six years, would grow into as a musician. If you really want to hear where Warren found his voice, start with ""Warren Zevon"" and listen to ""Carmelita"" and ""Frank and Jessie James."""
2,Promise of things to come...,"Get this only if you are really into Warren and want everything. Past that, there are a couple nice moments here and there, but if he had put out more albums like this one, we wouldn't care."
3,"Get This One Last, Fans, But Get It","Before I purchased this CD, I had heard nothing but negativity about it. I believe that that is still what's mostly circulating in regards to this work. To be fair, it's not a running start on a solo career; more like tripping and falling a few times on the track, only to be coached skillfully by Jackson Browne the second time around. But enough with stretching metaphors. I found that I liked it, despite its rough edges. Get this CD if you want to complete your collection, or at least if you want to hear Warren try his hand at some folk/country/blues or something sort of style. His ""Midnight Cowboy""-chosen track ""She Quit Me"" is the best, and ""A Bullet for Ramona"" shows his taste for the dark and delicious early on. Steer clear of ""Gorilla"", though; that song is not for all tastes, and may make your head explode. Meanwhile, pray for the release of ""Stand in the Fire"" and ""The Envoy"" on CD."
1,Rough Demo,"I appreciate Warren Zevon's talents as a musician. However, this first recording is extremely unpolished. The instrumental tones are annoyingly jangled. And the songs are quite forgetable. Even the cover of Iko Iko is nothing special.After one listen, most music fans will certainly pass on this. That is if you do make it through a listen without developing a migraine headache!"
3,Interesting start to his career.,"I never understood why Warren never talked about or played these songs. Now that I've finally heard them, I'm still not sure. A decent 1st outing. Maybe the process of making this album left a unpleasant taste in his mind."
2,Thank God it was a cheap used disc!,"I just had to have a copy of Warren doing ""IKO IKO"".Other than that, this is a very weird album even for ZEVON."
3,Important Addition For Classic Zevon Fan,"For those that of us that love Warren, then this CD is an essential addition to the collection.A bullet for Ramona is classic Zevon, as is Wanted Dead or Alive.Not the quality of some of his best but well worth it, even if only for 'A bullet for Ramona'"
3,First Zevon Rules,I remember buying this lp years ago. I thought it was great then as I do now.all Zevon is great. The other review blows chunks
3,Ok..,"Corvette America's First Sportscar Vhs(1998,Whitestar) Covers up to 98. A little bit footage from 1988 ""Corvette"" Vhs Video as well as the DVD Version of the Same 1988 Corvette Vhs. Some mistakes.. Still Decent Video."
5,The Best !,"Comprehensive and relevant for all Jews with meaningful insights into Torah observance. This text is practical, philosophic and a good reference tool. It's a great read, and a great gift. My highest recommendation across the board!"
5,Gateway to Judiasm,The book is giving me insite into Judiasm that I am able to understandand appreciate. The text is clear and easy to read. Definitely worth theeffort.
5,a master of fashion,a rare look in thiswonderful fashion designer's body of work. a designer that i love and every detail of his runway looks is out of this world!!!
4,Great for Taste of Home Entertaining,In a time when people are entertaining in their own home more and more this is a great reference to have at hand. I purchased it when I joined Taste of Home Entertaining as a consultant. And now as I recruit new consultants and hold parties I can use books like this as consultant and hostess gifts. The recipes are mostly simple using ingredients that you can easily find in your grocery store.
1,SUPER BAD! DON'T BUY!,"Bad paper, no picture at all, taste bad, too much ingridients. I just threw it away, didn't even wanna give it away to someone I know. Big disappointment. But Colin Cowie book for great recipes and nice touch party arrangement. No regret!"
4,Home Entertaining,"For the person who likes to entertain, this book is great. Home Entertaining is a great way to meet people and build relationships. There is actually a new party plan company call Taste of Home Entertaining that launches in May. As a person who likes to entertain and make money, this is a great way to combine the two hobbies and get into the company at the ground level.http://www.hometeamsite.com/join/jfriesonJenna"
4,a little-known gem,"In a glut of vain Valley girls, the Kobie Roberts series (and Thirteen in particular) are a refreshing alternative. I loved these books as a kid- and they still hold up years later. Set in '60s suburban Virginia, they chronicle the teen years of Kobie Roberts and her best pal Gretchen. Moody, sarcastic and smart, Kobie is a terrific creation. I too am holding onto these books for my kids."
4,a nice workout,"This is the workout you need for those days when you want to exercise, but you don't want to feel like you've been hit by a bus afterwards. Know what I mean? :-) It's ""nice,"" to put it plain and simple. It feels really good and is just challenging enough. If you do it giving your best effort, you will feel worked from head to toe. Do focus on the advice Kathy Smith gives about your form because that really adds to the results. When I come to the upper body section, I use 3 lb. weights, whereas in other workouts, I can do 5lbs. at least. This workout targets the muscles you are trying to get at, so you have to go a little lighter! But when it's over, you'll feel great!"
2,Cathy called ths one in...,"Ok DVD but not at all up to Kathy Smith standards. Boring, she seems bored, poor warm up and cool down."
4,Better Than Expected,"Let's be honest. What first interested me in this workout was the Amazon price. At only $5.99, I thought, what the heck. Well, it was a great investment. This workout is perfect for a lighter day. But, don't be fooled, it is an effective workout. It was hard enough that I felt challenged but nice for a day when I don't want too much exertion. It is a wonderful addition to my workout rotation. And, I love being able to program the chapters."
4,Good and somewhat painful,"This DVD has 3 separate routines - 20 min Cardio, 10 Arms/Chest and 10 Lower Body - you do all three with the warm-up and cool down or mix and match. The 10 minute segments are challenging. Kathy Smith is well known and has lasted so long in this business for a reason. I use this DVD in conjuntion with her ""Tummy Trimmer"" DVD as well. I'm really glad that I bought it!"
4,Jazzersize!,If you love classic jazz dance then this is for you. It's easy to dance through like a classic jazz dance warmup but with the benefit of core training and a little booty sculpting too. Is it tae-bo? No. It's chill but intense and you just feel good afterwards.
5,A great workout!,"I really like this workout with it's emphasis on Pilates principles. After experiencing back problems for the past few months, I have found this workout to be very beneficial.The workout assumes a basic knowledge of Pilates: using your core muscles.The cardio section is fast and moderately challenging. The upper body section is great, I have noticed a definite difference in my arms, even though I was lifting heavier weights before I started with this routine. The lower body section is also challenging.I have purchased many Kathy Smith workouts over the past 14 years, and this is one of my favorites."
3,Good for a light exercise day,This workout is fun but not very intense. The pilates standing and mat sections are much better than the cardio section. It is good for a day when your muscles are tired but you still want to work out. It is hard not to like Kathy Smith no matter what she does.
2,Just okay,"She is a little dancy in the aerobics part, which i am not into, but it is a good aerobic workout for me. The pilates part is good, but not spectacular."
4,Tough but good :-),"I'm not normally a big Pilates fan, but I do like Kathy and thought I'd give this a go to mix up my current routine. It's a good solid workout and is good for a pilates beginner (me) to intermediate.I found this very easy to follow and as always, Kathy is a great instructor who cues well and is great to listen to. You almost don't need to look at the screen to see what she's talking about because she describes in detail all the moves ahead of time. There is an aerobic segment to begin, and you engage your core throughout that. With the toning, there is classic dumbbell type exercises and pilates floorwork (use a mat). I really like how you can play this in any order. Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting.Overall, this workout is really quite good - I think it's perfect for beginners to intermediate and I'm sure that if done consistantly, then you'll see results. I certainly felt this for a day or two afterwards. Can't wait to try this for my second time."
2,Nice idea but not worth the money,I bought this for my 5 week old son who has reflux and is on zantac which he refuses to take out of the syringe because it tastes so bad. I thought this would be the answer but it's not. You cannot gradually push the medicine into the pacifier it just all shoots in there at once with quite a bit of force too. My son gagged when this happened and spit out the majority of the medicine.
2,"Two different versions avail. -one works, the other doesn't","I bought one of these and it worked magnificently. It closed easily, the plunger moved slowly and it was easy to clean. It had a star-shaped piece of plastic in the bottom.I purchased a second one which is a never-ending headache to use: hard to open, the plunger sticks and then shoves the entire contents through, and then it is hard to fill, so that the medicine spurts out while trying to snap it closed. When I try to administer the medicine, it causes choking! It has a circular piece of plastic in the bottom.I bought more, hoping to get another star, but got more circles and every one of them is useless! I recommend opening up the reservoir as soon as you get it and sending back any without the star shape. It's just not worth the stress!"
3,"Good idea, poor quality.","I've used this product a few times for gripe water, and it's quite a bother to use. The plunger is SOOOO STIFF, you basically can't use it for anything other than all the way out or all the way in. It really doesn't slide so well. I try to slide the plunger to the exact volume I want to fill it (so baby doesn't swallow a lot of air) but it's really tough to hit that mark. The way you open it (hinged opening)doesn't feel secure or snapped-in, and last night, trying to ensure it was fully closed, I instinctually squeezed it- pushing the plunger in and shooting gripe water everywhere. Then the little guy didn't need it, so I put it in a ziploc in the fridge- and it all leaked out. (I thought it was paci-up, but who knows!) Sigh. It's a real bother. Perhaps it'll be of use if I ever have to give cough syrup or something like that, but I've given up with the gripe water."
3,Not for younger babies,My 2-month old has a difficult time trying to suck the pacifier so not much comes out of it.It's also hard to open the dispenser.
1,"Don't buy- Should be named ""Big Gulp""","The problem with this pacifier is that the medicine is shot into the back of your child's throat. I now know why it cost three dollars...cheap enough so everyone wants one. That exactly what it is...cheap. I'll save you the frustration...this is NOT your new great way of givings meds to your children. I have 5 month old twins and after giving them meds with it the last time i went directly to the trash can and threw it away. And no, I'm not that idiot that gives everything bad reviews online. Save some money and frustration and join the group who is still hunting for a good way to give your children medicine."
2,Great design; poor function,"We purchased this to dispense gripe water to our newborn son. It works extremely well in administering the liquid to him as he has no problem accepting the pacifier or sucking out the medicine, which we use daily. Unfortunately, the dispenser began leaking shortly after we started using the plunger portion. Perhaps our item is defective, but the leaking renders it extremely messy (and the gripe water is sticky) and we will be buying a replacement, after owning this for only six weeks."
3,Leaks,"Great idea, but haven't found solution to the leaking. Due to this, I mostly use it with the plunger to get meds in her mouth before it spills out the sides. Sometimes its easier just to use regular medicine dropper, then put regular pacifier in her mouth as quickly as possible.Hope they can fix this, cuz I love the concept."
1,parents magazine lied,"This is hard to squirt, so nit tend to shoot out hard and fast. baby knows what it is and treats it just like a syringe. a real dud"
4,Works well,My baby has reflux and hates taking medicine. This product makes it easy to give her medicine. My only small complaint is it is hard to clean.
1,piece of crap,"i was almost impossible to open the chamber to put liquid in, almost broke the dam thing, use an oral syringe"
4,Great way to give medicine,We are quite pleased with this medicine pacifier. It's worked wonders for our little 3 month old who has to take Zantac 3 times a day. My only complaint it that it has started to leak a little bit on the sides. I may order a new one as they are pretty cheap.
2,Don't bother.,"Honestly, it drips really fast and then if you try to use the plunger part, it's just like using a syringe. This never even got used for us after the first attempt."
4,Medicine Paci,This thing is great. Very easy to give my daughter her acid reflex medicine. Without this most of it when done her face and on her clothing. It's easy to clean without getting old meds. stuck. I would have gave it 5 stars but the tab you have to pull up on before you put the meds. in is very hard to pull up which always causes me to open it then stick my finger in it to get it down.
5,slimfast works for me,when you are looking to cut down on calories and get some quick nutrition you cant beat slimfast...flimfast works for me!
2,Tastes Terrible,Very sweet with the distinct flavor of artificial sweetner. I wasnt able to even get down a whole can.
5,Great Taste and Satisfying,"I ordered these first because of the sale price. However, I was pleasantly surprised after trying these. They taste great and are more satisfing than my usual Atkins shakes. Only drink these super chilled though."
5,I love this stuff,"I used to be able to buy this everywhere - now I have trouble finding it anywhere. This Slim Fast low carb is really low carb - I'm on the go often, so I just grab one and go. I'm so happy that I can still purchase it from you! Thank you so very much!!"
3,Arrived curdled!,"I went through the first 3 boxes, and 2 out of 3 were curdled. <:^( I mean in a gross, lumpy, sour milk way. It is difficult to return food items like this to Amazon. They were not past the expiration date nor was this in the summer.As far as the uncurdled 4 cans... Optima is much better. The flavor was strong, very sweet and vanilla. It is not like a diet drink, it's like the supplement drinks you find at the store for those sick and elderly.From now on I am sticking with Optima chocolate, and I don't trust Amazon to send it to me. <:^("
4,Slim Fast 123 low carb,It is a little different sense they had to change it. You needed to shake up and stir it in with yourmilk or it seems to separate. All in all it is still just as good as it every was.
2,"Too much artificial sweetener, not enough satisfaction.","For reference, I'm not overweight. I'm 5'8"" and 140 pounds but often find myself on-the-go and needing to keep my stomach satisfied without opting for fast food. I bought a couple boxes of these at the grocery store because I couldn't find any of the Atkin's variety. I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed. Unlike Atkin's, these shakes are much thinner and taste very ""diety"". I'm a diet pop drinker and go for low-carb options often, so I'm not flat out adverse to artificial sweetener. But these are just too much. And they're not filling at all! After an Atkin's shake, I feel satisfied for hours. A couple after having one of these, it's like it was no more than chocolate milk! I prefer the thicker, less artificial taste of Atkin's by a mile. I'll be finishing these as soon as possible and switching back!"
3,"good taste, takes time to get used to",the taste is smooth and fills u up. but your stomach may take a couple of days to get used to it. i had to make frequent trips to bathroom.
2,Causes uncontrollable diarrhea...,"The good news that I thought the taste of the shakes was not bad (I have tried both chocolate and vanilla).However the products gives me the runs. I have tried it a few times hoping it was a fluke, but no... I get uncontrollable diarrhea after the second shake.My suggestion, when if you are trying this product for the first time do not leave home for a few hours after the first several times you try the shake in case it gives you the same side-effect as it gave me. I was not able to complete either of the containers, as the side effect was too severe to deal with."
5,Great Product,The product is everything it is proclaimed to be. Low in Carbs(low sugar)with plenty of protein. Blended with ice & cinnamon its a great out the door breakfast. Glad to be able to purchase it some where. I have been using it for over 1yr and with a low carb diet I have lost 110lbs. My energy has never waivered. I work out daily and still look forward to my daily shakes. They taste great and I get to have a chocolate shake every day and still lose weight. Some days I use the vanilla with blackberries and ice for a fruit smoothie. I recommend both flavors. Amazon offers monthly shipment with no shipping charges which is a huge plus.
2,slim-fast low-carb review.,this product is a good product over all. the only flaw was that it was very very close to the expiration date which made the drink not taste as its normal taste. i recommend buying it and hey its a great price.
4,SATISFYING,"The taste is not great - but, is good.It is very satisfying and I love the fact that is is low carb"
1,product expired,Pretty unhappy with this shipment. All the cans in my package were expired in July 2007
3,what's happened to the cost?,"I was delighted the first time I ordered this, a month ago, but now the cost has gone up by about $1 per box. The vanilla version is still the price at which I first ordered. What the heck happened?"
3,slim fast low carb drink,I was very happy to be able to get this product on line since the grocery store rarely has it. I was very disappointed that the product was all outdated when I received it. I'm concerned whether to order again.
2,Doctor! My Eyes ...,"The big problem with this book is you can't read the miniscule text used to illustrate the drawings. Don't get this book unless you wish to keep a magnifier handy. I'm a former newspaper editor, and I can tell you the font size on the drawings is smaller than ""sports agate,"" really tiny. And this book was largely ""covered"" in the newer ""Precision Pool, 2nd Ed."" printing. This newer book is larger, printed on nicer, glossy paper, and way more easy on the eyes. ""Edge"" goes into some nice detail on various diamond numbering techniques, whereas ""Precision"" almost blows it off. That's a negative for the newer book. I have both now in my library and I'm not completely finished with either, but if you want just one book, I'd start with ""Precision.""Pool Player's Edge"
3,"nice, passionate, fun read","it's not a quality read, but if you like the ""he was wrongfully accused of a crime, he kidnapps a women, they fall in love"" janre (which I do) - this one is rather enjoyable."
2,Whistler XTR-185,"I purchased this to replace an Passport that was very happy with, but I wanted a unit that was cordless. If you are considering the XTR-185 because it is cordless, don't bother. The battery life is very poor. Even after sitting in bright sunlight all day long, the unit will only run for about 1.5 - 2 hours. I find myself still having to plug it in frequently."
2,Intermittent radar detector,Detector turns itself off if it gets hit with a strong radar signal. Solar assist for battery charge seems non existent. I am throwing it away and buying something else
4,A sweet read for the wee ones.,"Beautiful art work and simple prose make this a nice story to read to your little fairies. Our daughter Mary(3 1/2) loves this book, asking us to read it to her again and again. Our only complaint is that it should be longer, it is too much fun to be so short."
5,Made in heaven,"I've been waiting for ages...but finally Ms. Staton decided to record a new album. Not a disco album and that's great. Her voice makes us to feel in another world. She expresses all her feelings in a real way so that is what I wanted. Her voice is powerful and listeting this new record you can get it. So, if you like her don't miss it. A stunning CD is waiting for you."
4,Short but fascinating,"Schechter's talent is his ability to communicate a complicated topic. While THE DEATH OF MEDIA may not break any new ground, it is the only book that has ever made me think seriously about the media."
3,A chat with an old mate,"This book is like having a good conversation with an old friend, even if some of the discussions appear rather far fetched, they are nevertheless thought provoking. A different perspective on the tantalising UFO saga. A definite for ufoligists"
4,A down-to-earth viewpoint about ufos and time travel,I am not a person who is easily convince but I almost believed that ufos were from another galaxy. Then I read this book and found another viewpoint. I found it neatly tidied up some loose ends that the ufo books could not. If you are determined to believe that ufos are from somewhere in space don't read this book because it will have you doubting your own viewpoint.
3,WAK,"Last year I attended a Keiko Matsui concert with a friend. I would not have gone by myself because I am not a big fan of ""smooth jazz"". Near the end of the concert, Kazu came out and played two pieces. I was awaked from my drowsy state by the piercing, ethereal sound of the shakuhachi. I was therefore very excited when I discovered that Kazu had recorded a CD.However, I was generally disappointed when I listened to the songs. Kazu recorded this with Keiko. Therein lies the problem. There much too much Keiko - solos, interludes, etc and not enough Kazu. The shakuhachi is too often not the focal point and barely audible.Will I throw the CD out? No, the music is worth listening to. But, my advice to Kazu is to cut the umbilical cord with Keiko. The music will be far more interesting."
4,Response to Graham Hamer,"I hope people interested in this book won't be turned off by Mr. Hamer's negative review. Most people with any curiousity about astrology will know several factors go into charting an accurate horoscope and no one single volume written for mass consumption could presume to do that sort of intricate and detailed work. A volume like this one is meant as broad overview of the cosmic trends and how they affect each sign and is to be read as such.Personally, I like the format of this book and recommend it."
2,just okay... weird blue beads,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I find that this lotion does make my skin smooth after it is absorbed, with only a slightly tacky/sticky feeling left behind, mostly on my hands.I rather like the scent, but it is very strong and lingers... it's floral, maybe like lilac?The main trouble is the weird blue liquid-filled beads that pop while you apply the lotion and leave tiny trails of blue until you rub it all in. And, hopefully you rub them all in... I've found some stray un-popped beads after applying. The beads don't make your skin blue, but I would hate to put this on while dressed and potentially stain my clothes."
1,Where Is My Product ?????,When am I going to get this product ??? This is the only item that has not shipped !!! Is this item on back order or what ?? Tell me something ........
1,Awful,This is trash. Never heard any of the songs and they definitely were not hits. Don't waste your time and money.
3,Soul of the 80's,I ordered the three cd set of Soul of the 80;s and honestly I'm not that impressed. Two of the songs sound like they were recorded off from a record that was skipping. Overall the audio performance of this set is below average.
5,Detailed overview allows good trip planning,"This book was easy to use and effective when planning my trip. Good overview of the key places to see, thus easy to select the key things to do. The hotel lists allowed me to e-mail the hotels, get prices, and make my reservations, along with using Yahoo/Excite/Fodors sites/listings to get hotel info. Small size and inexpensive price make it 1st of a core set of books to have. Start with this one then get an expanded one for more details."
3,"Nice, but pictures are not realistic","Tom's book is good, he gives good pieces of advice galore, but I must say that those pictures of 'Turkish women' are quite exotic for me, too.I am Turkish and I see women wearing that scarf quite rarely. In this case the book is misleading. Most Turkish women dress in 'Western' clothes, and the 'turban' has been prohibited at universities and all state buildings since the beginning of this century.I ask Tom to put more realistic pictures next time, those women are maybe exotic for foreigners, but they are exotic for most Turkish women, too. It would not be fair if I put pictures of the Amish to my New York guide as an example of ""American women""."
2,Damaged,"It can damaged, broken plastic on the edges and plastic pieces inside but so far I think the DVD is fine though."
1,Save your money,A very short 60 minute documentary with most of the material just old clips from previous WWE home video releases. Unless you just want this set for the matches it's not worth it. Very poor job by WWE on this one.
2,Nothing New,"Same gripe as everyone else; you get a documentary on one of the biggest and longest running angles in the history of modern wrestling that lasts 62 minutes. Just totally disappointing with no new information put forth. The only real highlight is a very honest Kevin Nash, but there is no mention of ANY of the true life backstage drama that let the nWo angle get totally out of control and eventually led to the downfall of WCW. In fact the documentary is very much in kayfabe at times, which at this point in time is just truly baffling. The match selection is OK, but just keep in mind that this was WCW in the late 90's, match quality was NOT a priority. After some truly incredible releases from WWE Home Video (Bret Hart's release, Rise and Fall of ECW, Monday Night Wars to name a few) this set is just a total disappointment."
2,Not a good telling of the NWO story,"This might as well be called, ""What Dusty Rhodes and his son think of the NWO"". About 70% of the interviews are from the perspective of Dusty Rhodes and his son. It's a lot of opinion with no behind the scenes footage and no solid match footage. What isn't interviews from the Rhodes family is out of date interviews and Kevin Nash continually pointing fingers for the fall of WCW and the NWO. Like all WWE licensed doc's on the WCW, it touches on nostalgia, but focuses a large amount of time on the company's demise.This overall is a bad buy. It doesn't have any good interviews from the wrestlers who mattered, it barely spends anytime talking about the NWO's storyline or chronology, all it does is shove opinion after opinion about the NWO down your throat while showing old WCW B roll. It's a cash in on nostalgia and nothing more."
4,Great Doc. But Missing A Few Matches,"Just wish the Match selection had the ones below.Hollywood Hogan vs. Randy Savage: Halloween Havoc '96Hollywood Hogan vs. Sting: Starrcade '97 ( but gave us the night after Starrcade)WCW vs. nWo: Fall Brawl '96WCW vs. nWo vs. Team Piper: Uncensored '97The Outsiders vs. Piper/Flair: Great American Bash '97Blu-Ray ExclusiveHollywood Hogan vs. The Rock: Wrestlemania X8I think if those matches were placed in this set, it would've been worth it, much more than it is."
3,"Not that ""revolutionary"" of a DVD.","nW0: The Revolution is a nice jaunt down memory lane for wrestling fans, but it fails to deliver any real new information or go too in-depth. Much of the DVD commentary can be found on older releases like ""The Monday Night Wars,"" and there wasn't much in regards to storylines/angles/behind-the-scenes stuff.There are updated interviews with Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman, but the majority of the product is rehashed material. The DVD glosses over the nWo splitting, it's reformation during the Vince Russo-era, and says almost nothing about the last incarnation with the original 3 (Hall, Nash, and Hogan) in WWE.Honestly, the best part of the DVD is the collection of matches. The WWE did right with their match selections and that might be worth the $20 to buy."
5,wrestling fans...,will love the bickering back and forthhistory how the nwo came aboutnot too much wrestling but alot of fighting words
3,Too Short,The documentary portion was too short. Other than that it was good. They could have gone into more depth. It felt rushed.
5,NWO 4 Life,The round table discussion was awesome. The matches were good too. It is almost a rehash of the Monday Night Wars and the previous NWO DVD. The WWE did very little to promote the DVD.
3,Wanted more,"I never saw the nWo because I always watched Raw, so I bought this to see what it was all about. It was okay but I expected to see a little more..."
5,The American Built Clippership,"A GREAT book - maybe the prime reference on clippers! The drawings are terrific - modelmakers, artists,, historians! A must have volume!"
1,Questionable,"This is an inoffensive book with decent syntax that is heavily derivative. Seems like it got a lot of 5-star reviews back before you had to be a verified purchaser of some book to be permitted to write reviews. Seems like 6 of the 9 5-star reviews (3 of them by ""A Customer"") were the only reviews written by those people (real or imaginary). I think Noirguy was a little harsh, but it doesn't take a super sleuth to tell that somebody skewed the rating average."
1,Outdated - don't buy this book,"Due to the arrival of FAS 133, this book is obsolete. The few examples the book had were difficult to follow. I bought this book before FAS 133 was issued and now,I regret I bought this book. Whatever you do don't buy it."
2,Poorly written-of absolutely no use to practitioners,"No examples, no illustrations. Just a repetition of some FASB guidelines. Useless to a practitioner. And I can't see why a non-practitioner would ever want this. Give this one a pass. If you really need guidelines, just pay up and get a written opinion."

2,Disappointing - not from scratch,"The recipes assume you are starting with a basic lotion, shampoo or conditioner base. There are no recipes for these bases. Starting from a commercial base takes all of the fun out. There are many other books available that include the basic base recipes as well as the suggested additives. Try ""Making Aromatherapy Creams & Lotions"" by Donna Maria if you want some serious recipes."
2,sparce info on the basic recipes,"I bought this book hoping to learn how to make basic skin care products, only to discover that the vast majority of recipes call for a ""lotion base"" or the like. The book does not give instructions on how to make a ""lotion base"" and the list of suppliers was pretty grim.She does seem to have a very keen sense of fragrance combination and the photos are fun but overall it did not provide much useful info about making skin-care products from scratch."
3,Good book on wanting to learn about cosmetics,"Found this book on amazon. Nice information on what goes into cosmetics. However, does not necessarily give information for from-scratch lotions. Did find a nice natural lotion base to use at this site:http://www.sfsoaps.com/lotion.php"
2,Not from scratch,"The title suggests from scratch but as everyone has said so far, lotion recipes suggest you do additives to a lotion base. Nice recipes though."
3,For novices and hobbyists,I bought the book hoping it would teach me how to make creams and lotions from scratch. But what it does is provide you with recipes on how to make your custom-blended product with ready made bases which you have to purchase. So it was not very useful to me.The information on essential oils is basic and scarce. I feel the recipes could be more sophisticated and in greater number. This book contains mostly kitchen DIY recipes.All in all a good book purely for beginners.
1,Bumbling wannabees,"These guys want to be what Developmentor is and put out junk like this. This book is a fine example of who Scot and Dan market to. If you don't know a thing about the subject then buy this book. Otherwise save your money and search for something with more substance. If you want to see just how aweful this book is then check it out in a bookstore first. Most of the examples don't work. There are code bugs, typos, and you'll need just about every free download that Microsoft has but doesn't ship with the MSDN subscription just to make some thing work. After you work through all of their bugs you should be fairly proficient at trouble shooting an IIS and IE4/5 application. My 4 year old son summed up the opinion of everyone that I know that's ever read this book. ""Poopy Heads"". There must be a lot of desperate people out there who need training because this book is embarrassing."
3,Adequate to the task,"This book provides good, if somewhat dated, introductory coverage of writing dynamic content for web pages. It covers a lot more than just ASP (in spite of the title) but it does it well. If you are a beginning programmer, do not expect to be ready to do much after reading this. I would NOT recommend this title to intermediate or advanced programmers; there are numerous other titles out there that are more appropriate. It is appropriate for beginners or for systems managers who do need to know the nitty gritty of programming ASP."
1,Fails to deviver professional level content,"This is an out of the box Microsoft tech topical guide disguised as a tech manual. For the price, one would expect more thorough analysis. The CD is problematic, I had to reload 4 times and load files manually just to get all the sample files. This book turns to other MS apps everywhere: MS agent, RDS, Front Page. There is not one sample app that stands alone, and it doesn't cover the MS products thouroughly enough to stand out there either. It also assumes you are programming on a machine with direct access to the web server. This is never true in my environment. All my apps are programmed on a remote machine then migrated upt o a production server. The two books I have come across that are worth their paper in this topic are ASP2.0in 21 days by SAMS and WROX Pro ASP. This is a great technology. Too bad This book will discourage many from taking it further."
1,More MS Propaganda,"This book was selected to be the primary text for one of my university classes. However, only a fraction of the book is devoted to the intended subject. Most of this book is an explanation of how wonderful Microsoft products are (yeah, right). If you want highlights of several different MS products with little in-depth explanations, then by all means, buy this. But if you want to learn ASP (as I still do), then buy something else..."
1,Big Disappointment,"This book is more of a propaganda for IE4, than a serious study of ASP technology. Stay clear of this and buy some other book."
1,No Substance...,"If you are looking for a good ASP book, like I still am, then you should try something else. Microsoft Press must not edit anything any more or they just think that their name will sell the book. Well, they got me. I bought the Scot Hillier VB Bootcamp book and thought maybe this one would be better. I won't make another mistake with a book from this guy. Since the book had no substance, neither does this review."
3,Great MS Internet Technology Primer; Bad Title,"This book should be titled: ""An Overview of Programming Internet Solutions With Microsoft Products"". It does a good job of explaining the what and the why of things, including DHTML, IIS, scripting, etc. - something that many other books are lacking (especially most reference material). If you're new to internet programming I'd recommend this book as one of the better introductions to the tools that Microsoft has to offer and how they all fit together. If you're looking for a book to teach you ASP programming, this is not it."
2,Not What I Needed as My First ASP Book,"Like many other reviewers, I bought Programming ASP because it was published by Microsoft Press. I have no objections to the IE-only nature of its focus because my projects are (currently, at least) on an all-MS Intranet. I was disappointed in the book, however, because it makes no attempt to teach me ASP.It presents four ASP ""projects"" in the form of tutorials. If you need EXACTLY these applications, you may find it useful. If not, you will follow me in looking for another ASP book.My greatest criticism is with the index: it's terrible, or at least very sparse. I always counted on MS Press to present an index that cross-referenced every hair on my dog. Disappointing."
2,"Wrong title, short on content","I had high hopes for this work, as I've attended training taught by Scott Hillier, but those hopes were dashed within 15 minutes with this book. As has already been pointed out, this book is woefully short on details needed to do real programming with active server pages. (E.g., try looking up information about DSNs and ADO, or error handling.) This book simply tries to be too much for too many people, and, in my opinion, it falls short. That's why I'm donating my copy to the public library."
1,Avoid this and go direct to Teach Yourself ASP in 14 days,Very little reference material here - one chapter (# 5) covers everything that other books (TYASP in 14 days) takes 4 or more chapters to do. The bible is Professional ASP by Wrox - a great starter is TYP ASP in 14 days
2,Too Bad,"This started out as a very good book. Concise, informative and easy to understand with good examples, Unfortunately it soon turned into a bit of a joke as it's two key chapters with examples turned out to only work with Microsoft IE browsers, the exact opposite of why I develop ASP sites. Too bad! thought I had something for awhile, still waiting for THE definitive ASP book."
2,"Misleading title, dissappointing book","Don't believe the title of this book. It's not a good book on ASP at all. Yes, it does cover much of the language, but it spends a lot more time covering things you didn't want to pay for. It's adaquately written, but nothing too impressive. In short, look for a solution elsewhere."
1,Did I miss something?,"The content of the book is helpful, but not at all what I was looking for. The majority of the book focuses on OTHER proprietary Microsoft technologies like Dynamic HTML, Visual InterDev, and Transaction Server. The content on ASP is short lived and weak. The on-line documentation and tutorial that comes with the ASP install is more informative and follows fewer tangents."
5,"ASP Books was excellent, giving all the ideas in brief.","Reusable objects, by using ASP, can be created"
5,5yr old son loves it.,"You'd think that a story about a girl pig would only attract little girls. But my truck-loving kindergartener son loves Olivia, both the books and the videos."
5,Olivia is Imaginative,"In Olivia Measures Up, Olivia is told by her dad that her younger brother will be taller than her one day, so she tries to stop him from growing. For example, she discourages him from drinking milk. The rule of life in this episode is ""school glue has many uses,"" as she tries to glue a giant version of her brother to keep him still (in her daydream).In Olivia Plays Hotel, a couple of friends go to Olivia's house when school ends early due to a snow storm. Olivia pretends that her house is a hotel, and her friends are her guests, but she doesn't want her younger brother to play with them. Ian is determined to be a part of the hotel game, so he pretends to be a ghost. This is one of our favorite episodes."
5,My kids love it,"My kids like Olivia. It is a nice combination of education and humor for kids and it is a bit funny to an adult, too."
4,La Sombra del Aguila,"Disfrute muchisimo esta lectura. Perez Reverte fue un gran escritor, su facilidad con las palabras es envidiable y tiene una imaginacion incontrolable. Sentia que yo era parte de la guerra que describia. Es un libro corto, muy ameno, que no pude soltar hasta que lo termine."
2,dry humor,"I usually enjoy Spanish writers. Not this one. Actually I had to force myself past the first pages, but I reached a point where I just could not continue reading it."
3,Monkeys!!!,"Super Monkey Ball might turn some people off because of the fact that you roll through level after level as a monkey living inside a ball. The object of the game requires you to roll around the levels, going from one place to the other. This can actually make you nauseous after extended periods of play.Super Monkey Ball gets its fair share of complaints for containing too many rip-offs of standard platform games. It's true the game is very much like a 3D Donkey Kong or Kirby, but you shouldn't dismiss the game until you try it, at least. It will satisfy you, probably."
2,I found a great use for this movie...,"Combating insomnia. Nothing like watching two guys drive or walk for 10 minutes to send you off to dreamland. I recorded it on TiVo because of Matt Damon. Once I watched the 8 minutes of driving that begins the movie, I quickly realized its value as a sleep aid.How can two guys pull off the road with mountains on one side, and not have the sense to use the mountains as a point of reference to get back to the road?Anyway, the long walking scenes with the crunching of shoes in the sand were great for helping me fall asleep, I almost saved it just for that. However, the absurdity of it all made me cave in and delete it.The few bits of dialogue were entertaining, the story about the wheel of fortune episode, deciding to follow the animal tracks but worrying that the animals would see them and not mate, therefore not get thirsty and lead them to water, etc. Actually, there is no etc., these were the only two."
1,"Oh, painful to watch",Considering that at least 20 minutes of the movie is taken up walking... walking....walking.....Just trudjing along trying to find their way out of that vast expanse. The dialogue is minimal and the plot boring. What were Matt Damon and Casey Affleck thinking of when they wrote this movie? What was Gus Van Zant thinking?
1,Dumb and Dumber go hiking . . . in the desert,"Dumb & dumber go hiking . . . in the desert. They get lost. That's it.Not a lot of talkin', which is good cause these boys ain't got nothing to say.Some nice scenery. About as interesting as watching paint dry.Ends with a ""WTF"" ending. Maybe some reviewers found this made the film ""provocative"". Lame cop-out for real plot in my opinion. You decide: if you can stand it that long.Continuity alert: Casey has a white hooded sweatshirt when he goes into the desert. At the big rock, it's not there any more. Considering how little else goes on in this movie and how important any protection is in the desert, why wasn't this omission noticed?"
1,A Real Snorer,Certainly not visually specatular unless one has a very large screen TV. 103 minutes of boredom. A waste of time - what was this - a joke? I said to my wife that I wanted to turn it off after about 30 minutes but she wanted to keep watching. Ebert said that about half of the people walked out when he saw it. I didn't get it. I would give this no starts if that was possible. One of the worst movies that I ever saw.
4,awe inspiring,"i was awe struck at the landscapes and how the characters moved freely within such a large space. i am not familiar with the real incident that happened in 99 but with this story i got the feel of being lost and the horror that may come with that.Matt Damon's character seemed edgy enough to survive. when he told Gerry, ""Don't cry!"" i knew that he would survive. the ending was a perfect departure - to just leave Gerry dead in the desert. i went because i read that they improvised most of the script. the film sticks with me even 2 days later."
1,Wondering About Wandering,"I was hyped for Gerry when I bought it! Gus Van Sant, Damon and Affleck...all of the ingredients for a good film! After watching it, I wanted to smack all three on the head for putting together such a piece of trivial self indulgence. The movie is lacking a plot, dialogue, action (other than walking), character development, character empathy, direction, sound track, and any logical reason for committing this farce to film. With only two characters in the film, it would have been of some benefit to know who they were, or what they meant to each other. This may be one of the worst films made in the last fifty years. Gus Van Sant...what drugs were you on?"
1,Gerry,"Sorry, this film really fits into the category of ""art"" not entertainment. I agree with all the others who said it wasn't worth the time. We watched the entire film, on fast forward, stopping only to listen to the small amount of dialogue along the way. We feel it wasted our time. It was akin to having to sit and watch a friend's vacation pictures of Arizona--ho-hum!"
1,A complete waste of time.,"Looooooooong, sloooooooow, booooooooring. One of the worst movies I have ever watched. I think the first time I was ever actually mad at a movie for wasting my time. Everything was waaaaaaay too slow and drawn out. Don't waste your time on this."
1,Yawn,"It was so bad at one stage I lost it and couldn't stop laughing. Save your money, or even better give it to charity. A huge, although beautifully shot, disapointment"
1,I'll never get those 103 minutes back,"...and for this alone Gus Van Sant will not again darken a screen in my life. A waste of film, a waste of breath, a waste of desert."
3,Visually stunning...but very drawn out.,This film would make the producers of National Geographic proud. It is a lonely and beautiful view of the desert we are given hear but the dialogue and purpose of this movie is vague and sparse. Alot of hopeless wandering in a big empty landscape devoid of anything.
1,Unbelievably horrible,"this is easily the worst movie ever, i am not a big shot snobby priss like some of you people on here portray yourselves to be. but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this movie sucks, there wasn't even a script, the blabbered on about nothing, there was about 5 minutes of their faces!! this movie was just another horrible movie with a zing, until the end, i won't give it away, but the end made me feel sick, that wasn't necessary to dig the movie in deeper, honestly, take the 20 dollar bill u were going to spend on this movie, and burn it. way better off this way"
2,Boring,"Okay, so there's beautiful landscapes -- if I want to see that I'll just watch the discovery channel or something. You don't have to show 10 minutes of this to get your point across. Luckily I saw it on dvd and just fast forwarded it to the end. I feel sorry for people who saw it at the theatre. Someone said it was a conflict between man and nature, that's ok but it should have been an interesting conflict like a tornado or something not just walking. Or at least cut the movie down to 20 minutes. It seemed more like 103 hours than minutes. I read another interpretation were someone said that there's actually one Gerry with two personalities -- that made it slightly better and that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. It was just too long and boring for my tastes."
3,I'll go on/I can't go on,"Definitely not one to watch when your patience is at a minimum, but Gerry definitely demonstrates Van Sant's (and Damon's) willingness to go out on a limb. I won't extend that compliment to Casey Affleck, cuz really, what does he have to risk? Anyway, the cinematography is beautiful. The central concept is brilliantly simple. The Beckett-ish lack of narrative and dialogue is... a little hard to take. I found myself wanting just a little more, if only to feel more about these people when I found out how it ended. But I guess I can forgive that, as it's apparent this was the filmmaker's deliberate decision. The Amazon reviewer definitely is right about the experience vs memory thing. Last night as I watched it I found myself wondering why more than once. But a day later I'm still thinking about it."
1,How bad could a film actually be?,"A new rating system has been introduced into my life since I saw Gerry. Gerry gets 10 marks out of 10 for being the WORST film I have ever seen. EVERY film I have seen is better than this ego trip and as such gets a rating from Gerry (10) to 1 (being a great film). Yes, it had stunning scenery, but no story at all. It was so annoying and frustrating - I can't even describe the anger I felt at paying to watch it.Do anything with your life than watching Gerry.What a shame Amazon dont allow for zero stars."
1,Gerry,"Gerry is one of those movies that make you ask ""What the bleep is this crap""? Then you realize that the contract must have fallen through to include the disc in cereal boxes as a promo. The powers that be put a price tag on it and the dvds were sold in the doilies and coasters aisle at KMart and in the gerbil toy department at PetSmart.I just wish they'd get rid of the smaller hole in the center - it still allows a water spot on my coffee table.Don't be fooled into thinking it's going to get better, it isn't.The plot - two people go walking in the desert without ANY water or supplies of any kind, they get lost in the desert and die. Thank goodness for natural selection! I didn't like it because the plot, acting, directing, musical score, producing, writing, catering, gripping, etc all sucked. My shot gun target thrower even malfunctioned when I yelled ""PULL"".I dare anyone to watch this movie then give this review a ""not helpful"" vote. You've been warned."
5,"Visually striking, and Affleck is amazing.","What Gus Van Sant has done with GERRY is unheard of: He has taken a film with no story, no structure, and only two actors, and... made it work.Casey Affleck in unexpectedly effective in this experimental, man vs. nature drama. His natural performance and the hypnotic desert cinematography are the high points of this mesmerizing piece of work, and are well worth the five stars on their own."
2,Postcards!,"Stunning scenery, cinematography and creative use of ambient light gives the movie a dreamscape like quality. However, the two actors punctuating the serene scenery spoil the dream to a rude awakening.The desert predicament of the Gerry's seems so childish and stupid that the viewer cannot help feeling a little irritated. Some of the dialogs are downright laughable (not for their ingenuity, but for their stupidity).Nonetheless, the scenery is astonishingly beautiful and that lends a redeeming factor to the movie that'll make you sit through the end. Surprisingly, the 100 odd minutes don't seem to long. The movie can be seen a failed attempt for creating a minimalist, but oddly compelling movie genre that Hollywood seems to be missing."
3,Beautifully Boring,"This movie about two friends getting lost in the desert is interesting and boring at the same time. The scenery and videography are beautiful and well done. The scenes can be very boring and slow moving, yet you can't stop watching because you need to know what happens in the end.Two men are walking through the desert, very little diaglogue, with very slow piano music in the background. It was almost too much to take. If it hadn't been for the good acting and beautiful landscape, I probably would have been bored to the point that I would have turned it off. As it was, I watched it to the end and was glad to have finished it."
1,how much awful can you get?,"Listen up movie goers this movie has to be the absolute worst movie i've ever seen.And i truly mean that.When i say boring i mean it.For the few reviews that say there is some type of creative side to this movie,what are they smokin? This movie is nothin but two guys walkin around some harsh terrain lost,rarely saying anything, thats it!Theres nothing else.Some people say you need alot of patience to watch this movie I've watched Godsford Park at least 5 times i know patience'this movie had to be made just to see what matt damom and the afflecks can get away with,example is myself i paid full price plus tax on this awful movie to see, well ""nothing"" i guess is the most appropriate word i can use on this website. Please lay off this one!!!!"
1,Total waste of time and film!!!!,"Ever wonder why your dvd has a fast forward button? Its to get through 5-10 minute long shots of these 2 driving down a road with no dialogue, 5-10 minute long shots of showing the back of their heads and 5-10 minute long shots of them walking. I just finished this very painful movie and felt it my duty to try to save others from wasting 110 minutes of their life on this worthless boring excuse for a film. It had all the suspense of watching grass grow or waiting for a dollop of heinz 57 to drop. Honestly theres about enough dialogue to fill MAYBE 3-4 sheets of notebook paper and thats being generous. Dont waste your time!!"
2,A Good 'Background Music' Movie,"I bought this DVD because I thought it would be a survival story, showing the emotional turmoil of being lost in the desert. I think it really fails on that account; The two men never seemed to get very angry at each other, or even at their situation, nor did the movie show any elation at finally finding civilization. It was unclear to me if one man died, but if he did the other Gerry sure didn't show much emotion about it.Another thing I found curious was that their beards didn't seem to grow much for being lost for days in the desert. They did not seem show any desperation for water, either.The best I can say about this movie is that it does show spectacular desert scenery. One other thing I did appreciate about the movie is that I could do other things while the movie was playing and I wasn't afraid of missing anything. In short, maybe this DVD is best played when one is alone. but doesn't want to feel alone, while they read a magazine or an Amazon.com book."
1,Don't waste your time... PLEASE!,"I was very disappointed after watching this movie, I have never seen anything horrible like it. You will spend a good portion of the movie watching feet cross the desert, really. Too boring. I am usually open-minded when it comes to movies. I can't see why there is even 1 person that says they enjoyed it. huh?"
3,Not a Complete Best of Without Track From Atlantis,"In my opinion, and everyone has their own, and that's why we have reviews, it is sorely lacking the best tracks from his album Atlantis, which to me, is his very best. Listen to that album and you will understand what I mean. Words would do injustice to describing Atlantis because it is beyond that. It is a true masterpiece and can only be understood by listening to it. There are just some things that cannot be reviewed with words and Atlantis is one of them."
1,disappointing,Loved his Middle Earth CD. This two cd set of 25 tracks only had one that I enjoyed. Too pop rock and not enough zen sanctuary.
3,Good cheap protection,"Not the best screen protector I have used, but for the price it does what it needs to. It could be easier to install."
1,Where are the affirmations?,My tape must have been defective. There wqere no affirmations..only subliminal music.
2,Where are the affirmations?,"Both sides of my tape had subliminal music....no affirmations..I was very disappointed. I think this was just a tape that was dysfunctional,"
5,"""Major Motivator""","What a motivator!! Great book that is full of common sense motivators that we all need from time to time. When I feel myself falling back into old habits I pick the book up and read a few pages and can feel the motivation return and I am ready to face any and all tasks be it at the office or at home. I recommend this book to everyone that needs to be motivated toward any task or to manage their time efficiently. It even gets me back on track with my exercise program! And best of all the book is small enough to fit in my briefcase or purse so I can have it with me all of the time (I travel quite a bit).Very well written, I am so happy I found it!"
5,Challenge,"I find myself going back and reading parts of this book whenever I feel that I am getting stressed out. It's has been a challenge for me that after I have read some of the Habits to remind myself that I am not too old to learn a new job or to walk away when there is a heated discussion or take a walk when I am stressed at work. This book has alot of good thoughts and ideas and it has helped me alot.And I hope more people would read it. I remind myself to stop and smell the roses more and I go to work with a smile on my face knowing that today is going to be a better day than yesterday. If not, then I stop and read a few pages from this book and smile. I thank you very much for this book and the others before it."
3,Desparate For Updates,"Excellent book and wonderful photos. Not much of an introduction and is more like a catalog.Desparately needs to be updated, as the market for Black Collectibles is beginning to surge again."
5,Treat yourself,"Space, adventure, intrigue, romance, spiritual space travel (""kything""), and the good guys win! Jon Malay has given us all that in his first novel and I'm eager for a second. This book is a fast-paced read, a perfect airplane companion and would make a great movie. I'd love to see the visuals and special effects. I found the three women in this novel intriguing and well portrayed by the male author. There's the rather cold, all-business professional; a brilliant and warm NASA colleague, and the Madonna-like Maria. Watching the dynamincs between them and our hero, NASA astronaut, Michael St. Pierre, was secondary to the adventure of outer space and Mike's exploration of spiritual mysteries, but certainly held this woman's attention. Good Job!"
2,"Lot s of examples, but no instruction","This book is essentially a compilation of various artists' portfolios. That's fine if you just want to peruse their work, but there is no instruction for those of us who are trying to learn how to master the techniques these artists used to create their works."
5,"perfect for zips around the mall, etc.","i was sold when i read that this stroller is *the* choice of london moms dealing with the underground. in our family it lives in the back of the car, and comes out for trips to the mall, market, anywhere with sidewalks. folds/collapses fairly easily, easy to carry up/down stairs, maneuverable, ok storage space. only negatives are: a) the ""step"" lever: wish it were bigger, since at times it's hard to keep your foot on it when unfolding the stroller; b) it's so light that if there's no child inside and you hang a coat over the top it *will* tip. that said, it's amazingly practical, and has survived almost a year of moderate use, including some off-roading, with no problems."
4,"Cute Bag, Good Price","This bag is adorable! I really like the bamboo handles. Unfortunately it doesn't have any inside pockets and the handles are so small it's really difficult to wear under your shoulder. I've been using it as an actual purse instead of just a beach bag. I get compliments on it all the time. Overall, a worthwhile purchase."
3,"Ehhh, it's alright.","The bag is alot smaller than I thought, no fault to the seller, I just thought it would be bigger. The lining of the bag feels like a crunchy piece of sytrofoam. I gave it away as a gift. Too small and flimsy to be a good beach bag for me. I liked the colors though."
5,"Showing me faces of war, and much more&#65533;","I can see war in these pages, but it's more than that. It's also about ordinary people and their lives, not just Vietnamese culture but something universal in all of us. Highly recommend!"
5,The kids will actually eat them!,"Doctor prescribed the iron drops and suggested mixing them with juice or milk.... tasted like drinking rust. The kids refused to drink it any longer. Found these chewables and the kids actually ask when is the next time they get their vitamin. They actually taste real good with little to no iron ""rust"" taste."
5,Amazing product,"I have been battling with anemia on and off, and especially during pregnancy, I have hard time since any prenatal vitamins makes me nauseous and with my first two children, I was unable to even take prenatal vitamins throughout. Doctors always prescribe me iron pills, but I get upset stomach and just have miserable time. With the third pregnancy, I have been experiencing low energy and I think it has to do with my iron level since this past year, I was almost had to get transfusion due to bleeding issues. Now, they have prenatal vitamin gummy, but it does not contain any iron. So I found this product on Amazon, hoping it is at least edible. Actually, the taste is not that bad and it quickly melts away and leaves not bad taste, so I was extremely pleased with this product. I highly recommend this product."
5,great taste / no aftertaste,Most iron pills leave an awful after taste and it's like pulling teeth trying to get my partner to take them. This one tastes great and has no aftertaste. We are now looking into the multiple vitamins from this same brand since the iron was such a hit.
2,Fell short,"I felt the sample of this book was not a good indication of it's contents. Most of the built-ins shown in the book are from a Room-View with the built in partially obstructed and with little detail shown. I wasn't looking for plans to build, but I would have expected more. If you like the details level shown on the cover of the book, then this will be right up your alley, other wise, the book will probably fall short of your expectations."
3,Good book - careful who you buy from!,"I found this book to be very useful. Yes, some of the pictures have been used in other products, but that's to be expected in such a comprehensive series as Taunton's range of books. No big deal. In a few of the pictures, it is obvious that the pictures have been blown up electronically, and the quality suffers a little (such as on pages 14 and 28). The content for utility areas is a little ""light on"" but there is plenty for nearly every other area of the house.I purchased my copy ""new"" through Amazon. It arrived well-packed, with the rear cover cut and the book marked as a ""second"" (the black felt-tip marker line across the top of the book). Amazon failed to respond to my complaint. No other book in that order was damaged."
2,Not the best resource ever,"I love buying picture books from which to glean ideas. The pictures in this book are lovely and high quality, BUT they do not picture very many creative built-ins. I was expecting lots of pictures of creative nooks and crannies to incorporate in my future building plans. I was not impressed when I saw repetitive ideas (yes, a built in hutch in the dining room is nice, but not creative). I'd say from the entire book I found 3 or 4 pictures of built-ins that I'd actually like to duplicate. I will most likely be re-selling the book."
4,For the house with no storage,Always good to see tons of ideas for the storage that we do not have in this house. Lots of creative ideas and problem solving for all the schtuff we have in our lives.
5,Great Product,I have been buying Hawk brake products for years and have never been dissapointed with the performance or the price.
2,disappointed again,"This is the second cd with wrong country of origin from Amazon. I always like to unpack all cds when they arrived.I have bought a lot of cds from Amazon about 15 years ago and the country of origin was always correct. This time I got 2 cdswithout mentioning ""Import"" to Amazon and but in fact they are not made in USA. The one which printed with ""made in Argentina"" on CD I have returned to Amazon and is going to get the refund soon. Unfortunately, I listen to this cd after I threw away thepacking material. There was a sticker printed with ""made in Mexico and packed in USA""on the PVC packing material. I didn't askfor refund since no country of origin printed on the CD. The sound effect is not good. I am disappointed."
5,Perfection!,"I bought this CD for one song, but ended up loving both discs, as it is laid out better than most DJ's could put a set together...perfection:)"
1,different shape don't waste money.,"I have Mr. Coffee BVMC-PSTX91 Optimal Brew 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemakerthis item number right but this item not correct item.total different shape, doesn't fit and button area little long.waste money."
5,Great Value!,The lid was a great price for the product. Now my coffee maker works like new again and it saved me alot of money!
1,Carafe Lid Performance,"Unfortunately, though i was the correct piece for the coffee maker, it began to fail as soon as we used it and we are back o a lidless pot again within days of receiving the product."
4,"Fits perfect, glad I didn't have to replace the whole carafe","The seal on our coffee maker carafe broke. I'm glad that we didn't have to replace the whole carafe and/or coffee maker. This fits perfectly, good as new!"
4,replacement lids,"These lids are really good while they are new, but wear out quickly around seal which lets the coffee become cold. It also happened with the original lid that came with carafe. I use this pot everyday so maybe the frequent use wears them out quicker."
5,Mr Coffee,"I bought two lids for our Mr. Coffee pot. Buying the lids worked out fine, other wise we were getting a new pot. I would buy the lids again."
2,Mr. Coffee Thermal Carafe Lid with Seal,"The lids came in a reasonable amount of time. They were in perfect condition. Although it's not the lids' fault, they did not solve the problem I'm having with the pots losing heat quickly. They used to keep our coffee steaming hot for 5-8 hours. Now, the coffee is lukewarm by the time I get to the office. It must be a problem with the pots themselves.The only complaint I would have is with regard to the high cost of shipping and handling. When I saw how expensive the shipping and handling was for one lid, I assumed it would be enough for both lids. It seemed like wise stewardship to order two and make good use of the S&H.; The lids were less than 2 dollars a piece. My order was nearly 14 dollars with the S&H; ... The lids weigh little to nothing, are not easily broken or expensive to replace.I wouldn't have ordered them if I had noticed that soon enough."
1,Carafe Lid,"I do like the carafe, however the lid does not work properly. I took it apart and tried to fix it but to no avail. The push button does not work. I ended up propping the lid open permanently with toothpicks. Now it works."
4,An interesting resource for understanding archeology.,"Kamp provides an interesting and well documented resource for understanding the methods of archeology. The book documents her research of the Sinagua peoples of Flagstaff, Arizona.Because the book is an account of a real research project, it provides the reader with an example of methods in use, rather than just explaining the methods as a standard text would do. The reader sees the techniques of excavation, dating, and interpretation come to life."
2,A very confusing book,I found this book to be very confusing to read. I had a hard time figuring out which group of people she was talking about. Her research was on one group but she would talk about another group without mentioning which group she was talking about. But I did like the one story she told in the middle of the book.
2,not a nail art brush,I bought the wrong brush while I wanted an art paint brush. This is an ordinary paint brush that works better on canvas and acrylic paint than for nails. I ended up using this brush to apply my acrylics for the nail fillings but even that is inefficient.
3,Haunting and alive!!!,"I read this book so long ago that the body of it no longer resides in my mind but it's heart, beautiful and hopefull still remain with me. Funny how much it parallels the book ""Being a Green Mother"" by Piers Anthony. I can only recomend this book and suggest the other to those who have read this one."
3,"Nice try, but most readers are better off skipping this book","The only audience which should consider this book is those who have a sincere interest in science but very little or no knowledge of quantum mechanics. Such readers can casually browse through this book and get a feel for how bizarre and interesting quantum mechanics is, thus whetting their appetite for further study. However, the book is very short, and it therefore lacks the depth and details needed to provide a meaningful understanding of the subject even at the popular science level. Most novices would therefore be better off skipping this book entirely and, instead, reading a more substantial book at the popular level, of which there are many. Readers beyond the novice level would definitely be better off skipping this book -- even for review purposes, they would find the book to be too superficial to be useful."
2,Next to useless,Was looking for a really patient basic book that would be as passionate as it was informative.... this volume was neither....
5,AWSOME!,"get this game no matter what!!!! this game rocks!! you can play as bordok, goku, vegeta, vageto, kid trunks, ssj4 goku and vageta, u can fight omega shenron, broly, tien, yamcha, hurcule, uub, adult gohan, teen gohan, kid gohan, and many many more! (over 40 characters in all!) there is also a thing called the dragon universe, where you can fly around collect dragon balls, and follow the story line!!!!! this game is a must have (trust me! i have it!) there is soooooooooo much more to this than before!!!!!! get it!!!!!"
5,The Best DBZ/GT game EVER!!!!!!,"Hey I have played budokai 1&2 and they were the best out of all the dbzgt games this is the best so far it has baby and it will have way better storyline then the last game.Also,It will have Bardock in it.I forgot alot of the charcters.it sounds good so you guyz better buy it sooner then later i am 12 so its not like taking advice from a 3 year old so if you wanna have fun and you LOVE dragonball z and gt YOU BETTER GET THIS GAME!"
2,luuuuuuuuumpy,"i don't recommend this unless you don't mind lumps in your pillow. its weird, and it smells like foam chemicals. i don't know, i just don't like it to sleep on. i lean against it when i read!"
3,Ultimate Building Bok,"This book is definitely for children over 10 with parents who like to do ""projects"" with their children. Seemed quite detailed and aimed at children who love challenges. Have fun Mom and Dad!"
2,"Excellent writing, but doesn't live up to the hype.","As somewhat of a skeptic, but still keeping an open mind, I enjoy topics such a `bigfoot' when they're written intelligently and with a base of reason. As for ""Where Bigfoot Walks"", I should've looked at other reviews of this book a bit more, but when Midwest book review stated things like ""...fascinating study of Bigfoot legends and realities..."" I gambled- and lost. For outdoor enthusiasts, this is a rich story of a man's travels through the wilderness. And I must hand it to Mr. Pyle, he really does write well. It almost seems as if he anticipated readers interested in bigfoot to get bored with it quickly, like when he goes on about hitching rides from Indians because he runs out of water- or something like that, but his timing is right and just as you're about to toss the book aside he throws in something interesting enough to get you to keep reading. In the end though, it's all rather anticlimactic, and not what I was looking for."
3,"It's about where bigfoot walks, not bigfoot","If you're looking for stuff about bigfoot(s),look elsewhere. (Sanderson's and Green's books are the best.) This book is about a trek in bigfoot country, something I've always wanted to do. When I finally do it, I hope I have better luck than Pyle had. This book is OK if you're looking for a story about an uneventful walk in the woods."
1,Don't waste your time!,This book is a total bore. Only a couple of pages that holds your attention. More talk about the scenery and walking naked through the woods. Don't waste your time.
1,ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz...,"As a well-travelled and experienced Canadian naturalist who has seen most forms of rare wildlife on the continent, including the ghostly Kermode bear, I give this book a fat zero for content. The new insights and personal stories from others that Pyle adds to the record are simply not worth looking for in this verbose piece of crap. And he got a Guggenheim for this?"
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I admit that I bought this bigfoot book because it was cheap, yet purported to be written by a serious scholar. That sounded like a good deal.Throughout the book the author claims he's not searching for bigfoot. I feel he's saying that to elevate himself above those who have made a committment to trying to find the creature. What he does instead is attempt unsuccessfully to take extremely long foot journeys (which he usually quits half way through) into the wilderness.The book is thus filled with descriptions of the fauna, and mostly, flora, of the forest. He tells a little bit about other researchers. He tells about hunters and people who have shown a taste for destruction. He tells about his three or four wives. I would skip it."
1,Beware the title,"I'll make this brief, for the people interested in bigfoot/sasquatch, forget all about this book. Now the good point... for the people that enjoy a well written book on a long nature walk, you'll eat this up. Pile is very detailed in his descriptions of nature and you should really enjoy this book. Bigfoot followers... not so much."
1,Where Bigfoot walks: crossing the dark divide,"As many others have said, this book is a true waste of time if you are looking for answers about Sasquatch. If you want to walk naked with a tree hugger, city dude who shouldn't be in the woods. This is a book for you. His knowledge is great if your are a bird watcher, nudist, and flatlander. His shear disregard for the basic knowledge on the wilderness, is uncanny. To read a book of birds and their calls is great. But, to bring inefficient and poor nutritional food into a wilderness, alone to boot. I am surprised he survived. If you are a ""TRUE OUTDOORSMAN or WOMAN"" don't waste your time with this book. There are many titles on the ""Sasquatch or Bigfoot"" Subject that are far more worth the time to research... I believe this author simply used the term ""bigfoot"" to market and sell books. This book is not for the real enthusiast."
2,Dissapointing,"I thought this book was about bigfoot. It is not. What little that is written about bigfoot is just a rehashing of much told events.Occasionally there was some interesting areas such as the author relating his meetings throughout his travels with a diverse group of people. The dialouge between himself and them was often interesting. But there is little of that. Most of it is his own feelings and musings about nature. Often these musings will go on for pages about such mundane subjects as moths. And at times the author does get a bit kooky, like when he talks about walking naked through the forests.At times his writing is good though. (Hence the 2 stars) The nature of the subject matter was just too boring and hippyish to hold my interest throughout."
4,Intellectual meanderings of a naturalist.,"Nice read, thoughtful, and provocative. As a psychiatrist I was interested in his ideas about what bigfoot symbolizes and why people obscess about this myth and the fact that until seeing this creature is a group experience, it will be considered a hallucination or projection. I was not impressed with his arguments about there being plenty to eat for a creature this size as when the author did his walk it was in the height of the berry season which would be gone after the fall. Large mammals like bears eat large amounts then hibernate through the winter while other large mammals like elk, moose, etc. have specialized stomachs to process types of food a hominid could never eat. It's unimaginable that an animal of bigfoots size could make it through a long winter without fire, foodstores, and technology which enabled man to live in these environments. One is then left with the interdimensional travel/UFO connection.... an it's inherent implausibility."
5,Pretty Darn Good,"First of all, I don't think it's fair to say that this album is David Lowery's return to the sounds of Camper Van Beethoven. I thought it was a cunning follow up to ""Gentleman's Blues"" and it sets the stage pretty well for the post-virgin records era that followed. In some of the songs you can hear a little more disdain and cynicism than what is usual for Cracker, but it works and on a whole the album is as good or better than any of Cracker's previous releases, with just as much ""rock""."
4,Coming Into Their Own,"It's taken some time, with plenty of high points along the way, but on Forever, Cracker comes into its own as a band. David Lowery and Johnny Hickman's roots-rock combo have never sounded as compelling or focused as they do on their fifth release. After a false start - the lugubrious ""Brides of Neptune"" - they hit a stride that continues the length of Forever's 13 tracks, whether coasting on the edge of Lowery's sly put downs (""Don't Bring Us Down"", ""Miss Santa Cruz County"") or racing along with Hickman's breakneck ""Superfan"" (whose titular protagonist is a less litigious version of the much-maligned ""stalker""). To sum it all up, they offer the funny-funky ""What You're Missing"", where they make fun of and pay homage to how cool it is to be, well, Cracker."
5,Cracker's latest a real value,"I saw that Cracker had a new album out, after several years of nothing new from the band. After listening to the album, I'd have to say that I am really impressed with the quality. With Rock anthems like 'Don't Bring Us Down' and a quirky 'Shameless', you can't go wrong with this album. With several diverse tracks, there is a taste of something for nearly everyone on this disc. Camper Van Beethoven fans will appreciate the gem cover of Status Quo's ever popular 'Picture's of Matchstick Men' that is included on a bonus disc. Also of note is the song 'Merry Christmas Emily'. The song is not what you'd expect, but more of a tribute to ex girlfriends of sorts. 'Ain't That Strange' is another very catchy tune, that is immediately 'stuck in your head' so to speak. I hope this review helps everyone that is curious, and or wondering what the band still has in them. An excellent effort, and well worth the money."
1,Cracker's worst album,"Someone has to bring the average down. I have all Cracker's (and CVB's) records and like all of them except this one. In my opinion these songs are pretentious, non-melodic and self-conscious."
2,Forever... a disappointment,"The witty songs on this album just don't seem up to par with Cracker's previous albums. I've been a long time fan of the band, after being a long time fan of CVB. Musically, it's boring.However, the price of the album is worth it just to get the Hello, Cleveland live CD that's bundled with the first pressing."
1,from clever to embarassing,"In the last ten years or so Cracker has gone from clever to embarassing. It seems that each album travels further and further along this course. I still listen to the s/t and kerosene hat. But after that the spark was gone. If you like old Cracker or Camper, don't buy this album. If you don't know Cracker, don't buy this album. Tacking on the extra ""live"" CD is just another way of saying this album is not worth buying but here's some more [stuff] to try and tempt you. Goodbye Cracker."
5,The Planets,"An all inclusive look at our solar system. Perfect for upper elementary students. Presented in plain language with lots of graphics, it is a great tool to teach students about the solar system."
4,Recommended for those beginning to study astronomy.,"Firstly, I wish to state that this series does NOT go in-depth into astronomy and the study of the cosmos. However, it gives the viewers a general idea on the birth of our solar system and a brief commentary on the future of space explorations, it does not go into the mathematical details of astronomy and the formation of our solar system. However, the visuals presented in this series is outstanding and inspiring.8 different titles are being separated in 4 DVD discs. The narration is mediocre (but NOT awful) and I would recommend the readers to get the region 2 version of this series. The narration is much better than the US version and it is less expensive as well.There is also a cameo appearance of Carl Sagan which elevates this series a bit. I would thus like to recommend ""Cosmos: Carl Sagan (7 DVD Set)"" by Sagan in addition to this series. ""Cosmos"" goes deeper into astronomy and our universe than ""The Planets""."
2,Old - Pluto no longer a planet,"A lot less visually entertaing than the title image would suggest. Somewhat academic, won't keep kids younger than junior high interested."
3,"Nice series, but it left me with many questions","Space missions are being retarded by guarding technology that could have military applications. There was a little to much black and white history and the program is dated. You can see more updated information and better pictures on youtube.com search best of science, nasa, hubble, etc."
1,Inane and unscientific,"Spacecraft whoosh by with Star-Trek like sound effects. Computer generated animation is indiscriminately mixed with actual satellite imagery without being identified as such. The episode entitled ""Terra Firma"" is about every planet except Earth! And the narration by Karen Stone (the A&E network host, not to be confused with Sharon Stone the actress) is dull and lifeless.If you're ignorant of astronomy and are easily impressed you might find this series interesting (if somewhat misleading). Otherwise, it's painful to watch."
3,Informative but old,"The information is interesting, but the editing is old school cheese. I had just finished watching the Blue Planet before starting this set, and this set pales in comparison. Granted, the Blue Planet is not about space, but the style, editing, narration, and imagery were ALL way beyond the Planets. I would try something newer if I knew..."
1,Look elsewhere for real science.,"The so-called ""great footage"" in this video is nothing more than imaginative animation.An 8 year old child could learn just as much about science by watching an episode of Spongebob Squarepants."
5,Very Enjoyable to Watch,"This series is not going to make you an expert on the subject of astronomy or space exploration overnight. In fact, if you're hoping for a lot of in-depth theory and any sort of specialized treatment of the subject: you will be disapointed!What this series will do is teach you all the genearal things about space exploration and the other worlds within our Solar System that you have long forgotten, not having covered the subject since you were in the 6th grade! One might compare it to a college survey course crammed into a few days.Even so, I found the series VERY enjoyable to watch! At times I felt like a kid again, absolutely fascinated by the potential of what might be ""out there"" and amazed by the degree to which our space exploration missions of the past had succeeded. If you would like to relive that experience or have children who are interested in the subject I'd recommend picking up The Planets!"
5,The Solar System - The First Frontier,"This is a wonderful series, which is a real treat on DVD. The series itself is very nicely balanced. Suitable for all ages, with plenty to keep the young folk interested as well as adults. Beautiful graphics throughout and relevant commentary compliment the solid foundation of facts about the solar system. The DVD features make navigation to your favourite episodes or scenes simple. It's great to have such an educational DVD in my collection that is so professionally put together and it's one that I return to often. Right up there with ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" as my co-favourite 'special interest' DVD. Terrific."
3,"Okay, but lots of talking heads","This series was okay, but could have been much better. Like all the BCC's work you can't fault it technically, but the abundance of talking heads does get annoying (though there is a little bit of CG). Any fan of space will find the knowledge they recite as rudimentary at best. It's okay for a novice, but otherwise it's pretty boring to hear a guy in a lab tell you basic facts about the solar system.Some of the archival footage, particularly of the Russian space program is very interesting, however.Space is incredible but show it to me, don't tell me about it! I think the BBC's upcoming 'Walking with Spacemen' series, which will be 100 percent CGI and use the technology to recreate what it would be like to visit various planets and moons in the Solarsystem will be much more interesting (If you have seen Walking with Dinosaurs then you'll know what kind of breathtaking visuals they should come up with).Anyway, till then, the Planets is still a great series."
5,A book that will continue to be passed down in my family...,"My mom used to read this book to my brothers and I. Marc Brown is phenomenal with the illustrations and story line that is so cute and entertaining. The condition of this book was very good, only cosmetic flaw was it was stamped by a library in the back of the book, otherwise perfect. My children and my children's children will definitely have the opportunity to experience the same happiness I did as a child from this book."
5,Loved this book!,I loved this book when I was a kid. The story line and interjected humor will entertain and interest children making this an unforgetable story!
3,"Great Story, Poor Reprint","Recollections of a Prisoner of War (Classic Reprint)This well told personal history by a wounded Civil War veteran is very poorly reproduced. In magnifying the pages 1.75 times, the type face was destroyed. The two portraits are very poor. You get what you pay for, and I wish I had paid for a better edition."
2,Supermarket-quality movie,"I first saw this movie on TV (early morning),and wasn't surprised to later see it at a supermarket checkout line.Frank Whaley plays a schlub who's considering working for 'Playboy' (a scary thought,this movie giving fear a new name),and who may (or may not)be in love with Annabeth Gish,his childhood sweetheart.The story is needlessly confusing,but you know the two will come together because they're meant for each other.Awwwwww...."
5,Good offbeat comedy. Worth a rental,"The Pursuit of Happiness is a light romantic comedy about a man who is dissatisfied with his life. He thinks changing his job and relationships will make things better but winds up in more misery. It's not until the end of the movie that he realizes the things that make him happy are right in front of him. Most will want to see this movie for Amy Jo Johnson, TV's ""Pink Ranger"" but the other actors in this entertaining film give great performances in this fun movie."
5,Awesome,"I used this for a hangar bay of the 1/350 Tamiya uss enterprise. All in all, This is a good product."
1,Does not work,This starter's pistol did not accept the 9mm blanks supplied with the gun. It was a rip off.
5,Steve Whiteman / KIX FANS!!!,"If you grew up in the 80's (1980's) that is, and were a fan of the Baltimore ""Dirty Boys"" then you'll like this CD....Steve Whiteman hasn't lost a thing!!! The vocals are the same, and the songs are reflective of KIX type music....Buy and enjoy!!!"
5,"""Blowin In The Wind"" is beautiful","The whole CD is really very good, but ""Blowin In The Wind"" is arranged in a different key and is so haunting and beautiful. My son is in Iraq right now fighting for their liberation, and I was in Vietnam. Bob Dylan's music holds a powerful place in my heart and I just had to get this CD when I saw it. I've listened to it over and over again and I really like it. Although not every song is as good for a quartet as ""Blowin In The Wind"", they all are worth 5 stars. If I could give this CD 6 stars, I would. If you have never heard Bob Dylan, this CD is still good IMHO."
3,"Great art, crazy writing","This comic will be a must for SNK fans looking for a comic with their favorite characters. The problem is, this is a chinese comic, so it follows the common style and clichés found in some manhuas - the ""shocking"" surprises, over-the-top fights, absurd plot-points and so on. So... don't expect the story to be really faithful to what you would expect from the King of Fighters or Street Fighter games.Still, some of the ""money shots"" are fully painted, making the art look absolutelly gorgeous (miles better than what you would find in the Street Fighter comic from Udon)."
3,"Initially seemed great, but turned out NOT to be useful",I bought it with a great enthusiasm but when I arrived at Morocco I discovered that the book is not useful for some reasons. I traveled around Morocco on bicycle for 2 weeks but learnt only very few phrases from this book. I suspect something is wrong with the structure of this phrasebook.
3,A little disappointing,"This is a fairly good learning tool - it comes with a book and a CD. I would have liked more on the CD (Not many of the phrases in the book are on the CD). One problem is that the CD is not aligned with the material in the book, so you can't follow the CD as you look at the book. Another problem is that the transliteration in the book doesn't always look like the way it is pronounced on the CD. For example, a word on the CD might have more than one syllable, but the book only shows one. The word for ""some"" is one example. One gripe I have is that the CD has many phrases using ""or."" For example ""hot or cold."" It is difficult to tell where the word ""hot"" ends and where the word ""cold"" begins."
2,Moroccan phrasebook,"Good phrasebook, but mine didn't come with the CD. Very disappointed as it isn't much use to me without the pronunciation help the CD would have provided. I messaged the seller and got a ""sorry you didn't like your purchase"", but they wouldn't look into it at all."
5,Wonderful book for grandparents,"Got my first copy of this book before my first grandchild was born (7 years ago). It is a great balance of humor and heartwarming thoughts without being ""syrup-y"". Fits us modern grandparents. This copy of the book was purchased for a friend for Christmas."
5,funny as I remembered,Love it and will enjoy sharing with my young nieces and nephew. Joan Davis was the first Lucy. I will be ordering more if they make them.
2,Not a fan.,"Velcro swaddles are much easier to use than this product which has nothing to secure the fabric. My son easily busted out of the swaddle, no matter how tight I wrapped him."
2,Need to manipulate baby too much to put this on; disrupts sleep,"I don't like this swaddling blanket since I have to move my baby around (lift back especially) several times to put this on. I have to lift the back to put the arm restraint on for each arm. Another time for the right flap so it is tucked under the baby's back. Then at least 2-3 more times to wrap the left flap around the baby. I don't like this at all.I prefer a quick, simple solution such as the Halo Swaddle Blanket or Summer Infant Swaddlepod."
2,Works only for very very new born,"I bought three of these swaddles after friends told me this was the best one. It worked well when my son was 1-4 weeks old. Soon however he began kicking the pouch down and breaking free which made the swaddle, in my opinion dangerous.WARNING!!! Also I have to warn new moms, when your child does begin to break free the large flap of material will end up over the baby's face and neck. I soon began to panic and wake up all night checking to make sure the material was not choking my son. Also, their arms can get stuck in weird positions within the swaddle.Also, do not leave your baby swaddled in a swing or bouncy chair unless you leave the feet pocket off.Because my son has GER he needs to be swaddled to get any sleep. This is not a swaddle for babies larger than 10 lbs.I have had no problems with the Halo Swaddle."
2,Awesome product - this style is different size though,"The miracle blankets are wonderful, and work as advertised. However, the died natural blanket is obviously cut different or shrinks much more than normal, as after 1 week, it no longer fit."
5,Truly a Miracle,"My pediatrician suggested I use a swaddling blanket to help my infant sleep for longer durations. I tried a few that I bought at Target, but they were too large, or too loose - and had velcro on the sides. I searched the Internet and found out about the Miracle Blanket - but was reluctant to spend $30 at first. Finally, I went ahead and purchased this blanket. It is truly amazing. The design is genius. My wiggly little 6-week-old infant cannot escape it! She is so content in it - she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at a time. The fabric is soft and natural, so it breathes. It's not thick - but jersy-like cotton, so it doesn't make her get overheated. And, best of all, it has no velcro and still manages to hold her securely without that awful velcro ""ripping"" sound when I take her out of the blanket. It's well worth the price... In fact, buy 2 or 3 because you will need one handy everytime you put the baby down."
5,baby sleeps like a baby,This is a great product. Baby can't wiggle free. He's wrapped snuggly and I have no fear of the blanket getting bunched up around his face. Must by for any new mommy.
5,Wow!!,"I will be buying this for all my pregnant friends. This blanket is amazing. My son was able to bust out of all other swaddles, making him angry and/or waking him up. It's easy to use and makes me feel safe (other swaddles would bunch up around his face). All the fabric on this stays put (as long as you do it snug like instructions mandate).lYou can change a diaper (if you wanted), but once my son is in it he sleeps! 8 hours the first night at 5 weeks. He also was hard to put to sleep at night. Now I can put him in his bed awake and he drifts off calmly! Love this blanket. Very worth it.He has gotten one arm out 2x...but I think my husband wasn't securing his arms properly--fitted but not tight."
5,great for wiggly hands!!,"With my first child, I used the Halo Wrap, however, she liked her hands out, so the swaddle wasn't much of an issue. With my infant, however, she likes to be swaddled & wiggles her hands out of the Halo in no time. At times, the Halo also ended up around her face, which of course scared me and prompted me to look elsewhere for a wrap. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I bought the Miracle Blanket and have added it to my list of must haves! Although my child doesn't sleep additional hours after being swaddled in it, I do have a peace of mind that it's not going to end up around her face. She sleeps well and sound. Love it and will be purchasing another! When she gets older though and outgrows the Miracle Blanket (recommended to 14 wks), I will be going back to the Halo sleep blanket."
2,Not safe for bigger/active babies,"My 3mth old is big & long and is about to outgrow his swaddler blankets (I use HALO and love them!). I am not ready to give up the swaddle, so I was looking for something else to use. This had such great reviews, that I thought I would give it a try. He woke up in the middle of the night with the blanket completely off and the long strap wraped around his neck and around his face :( In the blankets defense, he was at the larger end of the weight limit (he's 16lbs), so maybe it would work on smaller babies? I would rather have the velcro stracth or wake him up then use something unsafe. I also didn't love that you had to strap their arms straight down to their sides. Not a huge deal, but just a personal preferance. I returned it.BTW...I found the Woombie has some swaddlers that go up to 19 and even 26lbs. I haven't tried them though, so I have no idea if they're any good."
3,May work great for some,"I think this is a wonderful idea. However, it did not work for us. My son was somehow still able to wiggle his arm free, although I had followed all the directions and was using it properly. Maybe he is too big for it. I purchased the beige one. I guess I was expecting the fabric to be stretchier than it was. It felt like linen or canvas to me. It would probably be great for babies who don't move too much yet, maybe under 3months old."
3,Works half the time,"This blanket only works when our baby is already nodding off and ready to sleep. When he's crying and fussy we can get him swaddled correctly, but he won't calm down. When he's super fussy, he will work his arms partially out and get caught. Then, we have to try and reswaddle him over and over and over! When our baby is already tired and calm, we can get him in this super fast and without fuss and he'll sleep swaddled and will sleep for an extra hour longer.Just be careful when swaddling with this to make sure the top of the cloth hits the shoulder directly, otherwise it will wiggle up towards his face when the baby moves.This product works for us about half the time."
3,Insanely overpriced for such basic use,"One of my first jobs as a teenager was at Taco Bell one of my duties in the kitchen was to learn to make a burrito. When my son was born, the first night at the hospital I was having a hard time getting him to stay put so I could feed him. I called the nurse in and she wrapped him in just the same technique. I asked her to show me and as she proceded to, I laughed and said, ""Oh, I get it, like a burrito!"" She laughed and said, ""yes, just like a burrito."" It's quite simple and just the images supplied on here are enough for you to learn to do this wrap with any nursing blanket. I find it ridiculous to pay so much money for something you can simply learn from a nurse at the hospital or at Taco Bell. Save your money get the blankets similar to the ones used in the hospital and wrap your kid in that. Just remember to do it tight enough for him/her to not be able to move it's little arms out of it."
1,Developmentally inappropriate,[...] Read this.....swaddling an infant with his/her arms down is inappropriate. Infants need their hands for comfort. Yes the baby had tight quarters in utero but they certainly weren't restrained with their arms at their sides!
5,Lifesaver - makes swaddling so much easier!,"We have many blankets for swaddling and the Miracle Blanket, while pricey is totally worth it for convenience and effectiveness. We have tried swaddling with Aden and Anais and other blankets but our little one can struggle and get out of the swaddle no matter how tight we swaddle her.With the miracle blanket, the extra pieces of fabric make it a lot harder for the baby to get out of a swaddle. This product is truly a miracle product. I bought three more and this is our first choice when we need to swaddle our baby! We also have a woombie and swaddleme and our baby hates both."
4,Great Product- Shipped in Poor Shape,"I've ordered this product for many friends and all have loved it. Normally, I order it off the company's website, but this time I ordered it off my friend's amazon registry. The product showed up with the packaging covered in grease, so much so that it soaked into the cardboard inside displaying what the product was. Luckily the wrap itself was fine, but now I have to give it to my friend without the packaging because it was so greasy."
1,Better options out there!,"Where is the miracle? These blankets don't hold a candle to Aden and Anais swaddling blankets. I tried using this product and was not impressed. I wouldn't even give it away....don't make the mistake, go with the better swaddling blanket. Also you couldn't use this for anything but swaddling...waste of money."
1,NO WAY would i recommend this,I bought this with high hopes... they were shattered! my little one could kick his feet out within min. Also I contacted the company and they are SOOOO rude and hard to deal with. Don't do it. Learn how to swaddle well with a regular blanket
3,"Great now, bad later!","When we got this product, we only had one thing in mind ""getting our baby to sleep, so that we can get some sleep!!!"" It does the job well and our baby went to sleep very well and we LOVED it!!!The problem was realized a bit late or should I say too late for us to correct. Since the baby is totally immobile, we had to lay him flat on his back because of the fear that he would suffocate if we laid him down at any other position. When we got a bit older we noticed that his perfect round head was becoming flat the the back because he has been lying on his back too much. He is now 18 month and it's still a bit flat... :("
3,"Great swaddle, but no miracles here","I swaddled my oldest from day one...but my second didn't seem to like it, so I let my gaurd down. Well he never started sleeping through the night so i thought I would try the swaddle again but he could get out of them too easily. A friend recommended this swaddle, it is a great swaddle, he cannot get out of it, however we are still not sleeping through the night, and he isn't hungry, he just wants thd pacifier put back in his mouth...So it works for naptime, but not bedtime. If you are looking for a swaddle I highly recommend this one, but sometimes babies do what they want to do, regardless of what you do for or to them."
2,"Expensive, and easy for baby to break out of","Every baby is different but ours did not do well with the miracle blanket. People had told me how great it was, so I was willing to spend the money, since it is pretty expensive, but in the end it was a waste. We ordered it because he had started breaking out of the velcro swaddles at night, and waking himself up. But, not only was the miracle blanket very tricky to put on, but he broke out of it even more frequently than the velcro swaddle."
4,Keeps litt'un wrapped up tight,"Works like a charm. Sometimes its a bit much to get all the wrapping going and there is a lot of fabric, but it definitely keeps baby contained!"
3,Solid,"I enjoyed the book to an extent. I've certainly read better books of this tyope. It's a fast read, and there's certainly nothing wrong with the book, it just did not bowl me over.Would I buy this book again? Probably not. But it wasn't a complete waste fo time, there was some solid info here."
2,Kindle version review - There's a BIG oops factor,"I'll re do my rate on this item if you fix the index in the Kindle version. One of the nice features of non-fiction books with indices is that the Kindle versions have active links in not just the table of contents, but also in the index.I love the recipes I have tried, but, I was hearing about xanthan gum and wanted to know more. So, I look it up in the index and there isn't a link to find out more information. I don't see it in the table of contents. This book doesn't have interactive links in the index and no page numbers to figure out where to find xanthan gum. There are NO NUMBER LINKS FOR ANYTHING IN THE INDEX!!! There is a search function, but frankly, that isn't very obvious and it brings up a huge list to search through.I love Bob's Red Mill products. This, however, is a serious failure."
1,Wish I had read the reviews!,"The first review of this book is very accurate. I too have lots of experience with bread baking & was hoping for whole grain delicious breads to off set the high price in the grocery store. After making 2 of the whole grain recipes, I could see that the ingredients were off in their ratios & neither breads very good. It is too costly all around to use recipes that don't work & taste bad. I emailed Bob & asked if they actually made the recipes &/or did they scale down large batch recipes. I won't risk my money, time, fuel costs on another recipe in this book."
2,Skip this one,"I am an avid baker and am always looking for ways to incorporate whole grains into my diet. This book has recipes for a great variety of grains - more than just whole wheat. However, I've been trying recipes from the Bob's Red Mill Baking Book for over a year, and am consistently disappointed - they just aren't reliable. If gluten is a problem for you, this book might be worth looking into. If not, go for the King Arthur Flour Whole Grain Baking Book instead - recipes are wheat-based but always delicious."
1,Recipes Don't Work,I tried two recipes - the whole wheat pretzels and the cardamom rolls. The whole wheat pretzels were bread sticks (not the crunchy texture of pretzels as the recipe claimed they would be). The cardamom rolls never did rise. I tried the recipe twice! It was more the consistency of cookie dough than bread dough. A big waste of ingredients and time. I am a fan of Bob Red's Mill products and really wanted to like this book hoping the other reviewers just had bad luck.
2,Some Specific Corrections,"The Pumpkin Cranberry Bread on p. 101 is delicious if you double all the spices, however it makes one loaf, not two. The Banana Flax Bread on p. 104 has an unpleasantly gritty texture, but (fortunately) it makes one loaf, not two. The Pumpkin Bundt Cake recipe on p. 449 calls for just 1 cup of flour--I doubt that's enough. (The Bob's Red Mill customer service rep said the author is unavailable for questions, so I should just eyeball the batter and add more flour if necessary.) On a positive note, the Maple Pecan Muffins on p. 130 were very nice, if small. If you like to experiment with new grains, or need gluten-free recipes (I haven't tested any of them), and you can spot problems just by reading a recipe and will know how to correct bad ones, you'll manage. But why do John Ettinger's work for him? Spend your money on a more reliable cookbook and a more trustworthy author."
5,Only Adams could be writing this book!,"This book will deserve maximum rating, but I will hold back my final score until I have seen the cover....... ;"
5,"Finally! Just listen to ""Almost Like Being in Love"" !! Brings me back 30 years!","I used to play this album incessantly and have always wanted it in CD but just now discovered it has finally been made available in mp3 format! The ""Almost Like Being in Love"" is just so lovely, the way music used to be. Dating myself here but it's a CLASSIC and for those of you younger people just listen to it! I am very happy with this. I wish Amazon would do more of their 1.99 album sales! that's how I discovered it, on a lark.I tried copying some of my CD's to MP3 but you could hear every scratch as I didn't take good care of many of them. Anyway this is a fantastic album and I am thrilled to be able to listen to Michael Johnson again."
