2,Loved it until.......,.....the button stopped working. It started out slowly where sometimes I had to hit the button twice to get it to start. This morning it wouldn't work at all. I've had it for just over 90 days.
5,It's great...and saves me $$$,I have yet to find a fault with this product. I now make my own cofee instead of visiting Dunkin' Donuts every day.My old grinder used to only grind 6 ounces of beans -- this one does 15.What I especially love about this grinder is the ability to remove the grinding cup to dump the ground beans into my coffee maker. My other grinder had no separate parts and required me to turn the whole unit over to dump out the beans (which was hard to clean too.) Being able to remove the cup makes it super easy to clean.
1,Cover vibrates loose. Shuts off early.,"Like others, I have experienced this early shut-down right out of the box. It appears the plastic cover loosens and will not keep the 'safety switch' in the back on. The coffee beans are chopped up for a few seconds, then the unit quits. Now what do you do? It won't restart unless you reset the cover. And then, it usually quits early again. If it doesn't, your total grind-time is so excessive the beans are now coffee-dust. There is simply no controlling this spastic unit.The only way to force this thing to work is to hold the cover in a clockwise twist while the coffee is grinding. So much for being 'automatic'. This unit should be re-called and the designer sent back to the bar where he/she designed this thing."
1,Breaks within a few months each time,My review would be 5 stars but the Swiffer wet jet consistently stops working after 3-6 months. Waste of money.
1,Wasteful and a black hole for money,"I think all the other reviewers have already summed up the problems with the Swiffer Wet Jet, but I'll try to run down the list.1) It requires four batteries, and they have to be DISPOSABLE batteries. That's right, no rechargeable ones.2) The batteries run down after what seems like six uses.3) The cleaning fluid container is not meant to be refilled. With some effort you can force it open, but they made it so that you're meant to buy the Swiffer cleaning fluid, HOWEVER4) The Swiffer cleaner smells really strong and chemically.5) The cleaning pads you velcro onto the Wet Jet are disposable, and since they get grimy really quickly you will end up buying a ton of them.6) It doesn't really clean thoroughly, and leaves a bit of a film.Pretty much a money making scam."
3,It's okay,"I'm rating this item okay. I don't like to use it for regular mopping. Prior to using the WetJet, I sweep or vacuum the floor. After mopping, there is so much residue left on the floor, that I have to sweep or vacuum again. The pads DO NOT pick up as advertised. The end of the mop is supposed to contain a scraper that advertises that all you have to do is turn the mop on its end with your foot and scrape hard to remove residue. This has never worked for me. I have to carry a plastic scrapper to remove any residue left on the floor. The only good use I have found for it so far is to use for touch-ups or a quick surface cleaning between regular mopping, or if I have unexpected company. If you have any kind of pattern on your floor, it doesn't work at all between the grooves."
5,Favorite childhood book,I LOVE this book. It was my favorite as a child and I still love it. I bought a bunch so I could share them with my grandchildren.
2,An excellent book but problems with the edition I purchased,"I've read excerpts from this book before, specifically the excellent Judith Butler essay. However the edition of the book I purchased printed pages 75-106 in place of pages 27-58, while printing the same pages in sequence as well."
4,Shoegaze!,"I first heard their music on MTV, then bought this CD. Much better than I thought. It's good shoegaze."
2,Disappointing,"Musically this CD is relatively sound. There are some wonderful guitar-scapes and very interesting forays into a more experimental sound, such as the final track. Most of it, however, seems simply to be an attempt at duplicating the sound of other bands, namely Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine, rather than being inspired by such music and taking it a step further. A good example of a band that did this well is the now defunct lovesliescrushing. Another problem is that the vocals are just plain garbage. Maybe the band should take a hint from Godspeed You Black Emperor and just take them out completely. Overall, it feels that the band lacks an artistic vision, and I would only recommend this CD to anyone who finds that this is not important, and is simply seeking to relive their showgaze past."
3,"A chicken in every Nesco, a Nesco in every home","These just aren't as good since they started making them in China. But, they wouldn't sell many U.S. made for $50 if you can buy other brands made in China for $25. It is too bad because my old American made is still a better product although it is probably 50 years old or more. ""Stunk up the house"" should have read the directions. I think all the Nesco roasters come with instructions for pre-heating in a well-ventilated area. Buy new if you want, but don't pass up a chance to buy an old one at an estate sale or auction. You can always put a nonstick cookwell in an old one. My old one will be a 5-star model until the day it dies."
5,Nesco,"Nesco 4816-47-30 6-Quart Roaster Oven with Removable Cookwell, Millennium SilverThis is the best roaster oven ever made! We have had ""slow cookers"" before but have never had one like this. We liked it so much we bought 3 more to give as gifts to family! It is so versatile. You can slow cook, roast and bake in it. I am so glad we bought this oven!"
4,"Nice, but not well made","I've had my roaster for about 6 months. I like the way the food comes out, and I use it about once a week. But one of the plastic handles cracked off right after I received it, and now the knob on the cover keeps falling off. Also, I have trouble figuring out what temperature I'm setting with the dial on the front. I enjoy using it, but I don't think it will last much longer!"
4,Too soon,"I have only had this roaster for a few weeks, used it twice so it's too soon to tell how it will stand up but it works well and is easy to clean."
1,STUNK UP THE HOUSE,The first time I plugged this in it emitted a burning plastic/dead fish smell that stunk up my home 10 minutes before my guests were to arrive for a Christmas Party. I put it out in the garage which even unplugged the thing reaked until I and eventually threw it in the yard.
4,Great product.,"I just used my nesco roaster to roast a chicken and it came out fantastic. The chicken was very tender and juicy. I smoked out the roaster for an hour and it was not enugh. It still had a very bad smell. You have to let it burn off for at least 4 hours. But it was well worth the effort.I would buy this product again. The only fault I found was that the lid feels kind of flimsy, I feel they could have made it better quality. however it is still a great product."
5,Wow - pictures of the city...,"and they're luscious! This is the book that first awakened my daughter (at 19 months old) to speaking about color. But regardless of color concepts, I would have wanted to share these photographs, which make me love things like a broken umbrella in a trash can. It's art for toddlers: She was absorbed."
1,Wow. Really?,I am surprised that this book was even published. Really? Pictures of leaves and garbage in the gutter? Rusty propane tanks and construction equipment? This is what is supposed to teach my child about colors? No thank you.
2,Has color but not many pages,"I would not highly recommend this book, has colors but not enough pages, not worth the price.See other review on book with Fruit, Alphabet and Color - that is a better book."
2,A curiosity,"I had heard of the Genesis Suite years ago when first exploring the music of Schoenberg and Stravinsky and heard their contributions. Not ever seeing a copy of the LP and knowing it is quite rare, I snapped up this recording. I can see why it has languished in obscurity since the '40s. The Schoenberg is excellent as is the Stravinsky. A rank below that is the Toch,Tansman and Milhaud. The rest is pretty bottom drawer with the contribution of ""Creation"" by the ""arranger"" Shilkret almost intolerable. Get it if you want your curiosity satisfied. Surprisingly good sound with some surface noise."
3,Finger hoppers go jazz,What's it like? Spinal Taps new direction - Jazz Odyssey. There are some great chops here...just ditch the 80's metal boys just as you ditched your big hair...
1,I dream of Hairbands . . . .,It came to me in a dream that I should get a big band together (like count basie's) and do covers of megadeth!
5,"This is the album I have been looking for, for years","I love both heavy metal and jazz, and I have been looking for a good confluence of the two. I've found some swingcore (Cherry Poppin' Daddies, Hipster Daddio & The Hand Grenades, Leslie Bell & The First Bang Band), but most of it never lived up to its potential. The Lukather/Carlton collaboration was good but also fell short, and Stanley Jordan's experiments were too tentative.This, however, is terrific. Skolnick is a great guitar player with serious knoweldge of music theory. The arrangements are truly in the jazz idiom, with the requisite improvistational feel and the triad chord structure, but the melodies are metal all the way (if tamed a bit). I've been listening to this album a lot."
5,Ozzy and Kiss played by a jazz combo??!!!!,"Before hearing this album, I'm not sure that I would have believed that a jazz trio playing arrangements of some heavy metal classics could work very well (even led by a great guitarist like Alex Skolnick). But this album is absolutely brilliant. By building around the riffs from the original songs, the band was able to give the songs an unusual amount of structure and energy. The musicianship is stellar, and the recording is very good. My favorite track is War Pigs, but I have listened to this CD from start to finish many times!Best of all, the sound and the songs work wonderfully in a live setting. I've seen the band play live twice, and both shows were great!"
4,Emperor: Rise of Kingdoms,"Emperor is a real-time game in which you must fulfill stated criteria for each scenario. It has many levels of difficulty and if you start with the tutorial it allows you to learn the game as you progress. I have found it highly addicting. You must either build a new city or add a monument or complete other tasks in an existing city. It also gives a bit of a history of ancient China that adds interest to the game. However, if you like controlling your armies moves personally, this game will not suffice. The fighting is limited and you have little control. Your villagers do, however, get to build the Great Wall, and the Terra Cotta Army, among other things."
5,Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdon,"I have only played the demo which I downloaded and found it absolutely fascinating. I want the whole thing! It is nearly as much fun as Zeua, Pharaoh, Cleopatra and Posiden all in one! I love it!"
4,OK But Microsoft Screwed Me Again,"E:ROTMK is a great conquest and city builder game. Unfortunately, when I installed MS SP2, the game quits working. Well, not the entire game. The game will still funtion but you can't download the patch or the extra stuff so you are pretty much stuck with a game with all the bugs. I did enjoy playing it however and am planning on buying Ceasar 4 and probably Children of the Nile."
3,Wrong Title .........,"As a Native Speaker of Chinese and as a Chinese Myself, I am confident to saythat ''""&#20013;&#22283;""(Chinese characters meaning China) means Central Kingdom not ""Middle Kingdom"""
1,I should qualify the 1-star,"The demo version of the game is very good but be forewarned when buying the retail version: I and many other customers have had problems installing and/or playing this game! The Emperor website has a forum where users can share their experiences and many, including myself, have vented about our inability to run the game based on the minimum system requirements. Be warned: if you have the minimum system requirements for Emperor, that may still not be enough. I have more than adequate resources to run the game, but the intro movie is the only thing that will play, then my monitor goes blank and its lights all begin blinking. There do not appear to be any patches in development to address user concerns at this time. I am not the only user who has experienced this frustrating problem. I'm returning my copy of the game and will try something else."
3,Pass!!!,"I love Joanie's style, but this video is a little outdated. The techniques used are not very comfortable & more than a little confusing!Not Joanie's best work!!"
3,Beautiful but safe....,"I have long been a fan of Lisa Gerrard and DCD and I usually cherish every new release. Yet ""the Silver Tree"" seems to reminiscent of her latest collaborations with artists such as Patrick Cassidy and her movie scores. I long for something less cinematic and more eclectic as ""The Mirror Pool"" Gerrad's latest releases sound too much like epic movie scores..which is nice but has gotten a bit superannuated. That is not saying that this is not another grand effort with the trademark sweeping and beautiful symbiosis of voice and instruments. Perhaps her next solo effort will take a more creative direction."
4,Otherwordly.,All the things others say about her voice are true. Otherworldly. I have some Dead Can Dance that I treasure also. When I put The Silver Tree on I just let it have the house. And it has the house.
4,Awesome,Lisa Gerrard is awesome in style and sound and her music is quite deep. The originality of voice and music is a must buy.
4,It's Pure Lisa...,"This CD is pure Lisa....what else is there to say? She melts your heart and soul with wonderful offerings of her voice - at times, so small and at others, very penetrating. I think the CD would be amazing to listen to while practicing and/or teaching yoga."
3,Subtle and Intimate...a Different Sound for Lisa Gerrard,"THE SILVER TREE retains Lisa Gerrard's signature gloom, but has a more limited sound palette than her previous albums, including her work with Brendan Perry as DEAD CAN DANCE. It has none of the baroque despair or medieval atmospherics of her other work, but instead presents a muted soundscape of simple songs that reveal Gerrard's ability to produce a quiet, more restrained emotional resonance. Try listening to some tracks from this album before you buy it; it represents a somewhat new direction for Lisa Gerrard, and diehard DCD fans may be challenged by the absence of more recognizable elements of Gerrard's work."
4,Dark ambient,"Ok listening, not good sleeping music because of too many tempo changes. Lisa's voice is sounding good on this album, but somewhat different than her previous work. Not bad, just different."
3,Blue Plate,This is an awesome band but this is not an awesome album. There are some tracks that show the brilliance of this group but the whole album leaves me a little flat. Mind you it is hard to reproduce the brilliance of California Project every time. Worth having and definitely worth listening to but not their best.
4,"Different, but not bad.","The Deception of the Emerald Ring is different in the sense that it doesn't draw you into th reading immediately, but if you continue on with it, you won't be able to put it down. At first, it does drag on a bit, but soon enough, the excitement that we all love if Lauren Willig's writing, and the romance, picks up again. I'm not entirely done with the book, but right now, it's more than being an entertaining read. I have all 3 so far, and this one makes me anticipate a 4th."
5,Great Read!! Fresh and Entertaining!,"I must first say that I loved Lauren Willig's first two Pink Carnation novels, so when I picked this one up I was already predisposed to enjoy myself. However, I was even more impressed with this one! I felt that Willig really pulled off keeping both the Modern and Historical portions of the tale fresh and interesting. This one really kept me turning the pages. I must say my only disappointment is that I've finnished reading the last page. Great Job! I am looking forward to the next one!"
3,Is the third time a charm?,"Well, is the third time a charm? Yes and no. Ms. Willig continues to stick with her formulaic writing.The plot is as predictable as its predecessors but, it is still enjoyable. Once again, I recommend for those who are interested in historical romances."
3,Not the best that Willig has to offer,"I have thoroughly enjoyed every book in Willig's Pink Carnation series, and this one is no exception. However, Willig relies far too heavily on miscommunication as a plot device in this installment."
3,Not as good as her prior work,"Having read both of Lauren Willig's prior books, I was looking forward to this new one. However, I found that I was seriously disappointed upon finishing it. The story felt rushed, and the characters' involvement in the goings on in Ireland at the time felt contrived. This story had so much potential that she never explored.I have given this book a rating of 3 because it held my interest, was surprising and funny at times, and because I have enjoyed this author's prior work so much. Those fans of the prior two books will still enjoy this one, I think. I've read that Willig plans another few sequels in this storyline, in which I hope she will finally give Jane her own story, and give us another fast-paced, exciting read similar to her first two."
2,"Boo to forced marriages, Stopped there","I read the first two and liked the strong main characters. However, this book starts off with a girl being forced into marriage by cultural norms. I realize it is the custom of the time, and that is fine, but to use it as the jumping off point for a book of female empowerment is wrong. I stopped reading after that, which incidentally was in the first or second chapter. I don't remember, as I have blocked it from my memory.I strongly recommendThe Secret History of the Pink Carnation, which is the first book in the series and the best of all."
2,A concern...,"I may just be unlucky, but my Panasonic PV-D4742 player was faulty. It would not accept my VHS videos; it consistently spit them back out. So I exchanged it for another PV-D4742, and it would only accept one out of three videos. Spit the others right out, no apparent pattern to the rejects. So despite the good quality of the picture and trouble-free DVD player, we returned our second Panasonic player and had to switch to another brand.I hope these are the only two faulty players out there, since I have always had reliable Panasonics before."
1,Buy Any Other Brand,"While I have not had any problems with the VHS player in the unit, the DVD player displays a moving black bar running across the screen when playing any DVD. My unit has been in the repair shop for the last 5 months. The service center has replaced most of the major components as well as making several timing and setting adjustments. But they have not been able to correct the problem. I am very ANGRY at Panasonic for not simply replacing the unit since it is obvious that it cannot be repaired correctly. I used to be long time fan of Panasonic products, but after this experience, I will NEVER again purchase another Panasonic product."
1,DVD Player Doesn't Work,"Just hooked up the unit yesterday. DVDs freeze and we get the ""check for scratches"" error message. We have tried 4 different brand new DVDs and have gotten the same result. The only reason that I bought this through [this site] is that there were so many good reviews, otherwise I would have bought it locally so I could return it easily..."
2,Don't buy this Panasonic!,"I have been so pleased with all my other Panasonic products that I blindly purchased this producted without researching it. What a mistake! I did not have any problems with the DVD player - it did have excellent picture and sound. However, the VCR would not accept certain tapes - some were tapes we had recorded, others were my daughter's Disney movies. Very frustrating! I actually purchased and returned 2 separate units before I gave up! Also disappointing was the lack of a timer on the display. Don't waste your time and energy like I did!"
2,Not Good Enough,"The VCR cannot, of course, tape DVDs, but more importantly, theVCR cannot be programmed for repeating events! The front-paneldisplay doesn't tell how much time the tape or DVD has beenplaying or even whether there's a tape or disc inside. Thecombination stop/eject VCR button is annoying as well."
1,Infuriating!,"I will never again spend 300 dollars on any Panasonic product. I've had wonderful luck with their car audio products, but this thing wasn't worth even half of what it cost. The DVD player started to malfunction after about a year, with that wonderfully annoying ""Please check the disc and for scratches and stains on disc"" message. Brand new DVDs wouldn't even play...but strangely, CDs don't give me any problems. Now, if you'll exucse me, I must go shop for a Toshiba to replace this ridiculous combo VCR/CD player."
2,Could be much better.,"The DVD player portion of this seems to often have problems. Mine has the same problem as numerous others I have heard about on the Internet. Even when trying to play brand new DVDs, it gives an error message suggesting they are scratched. They really are not scratched. Unfortunately, mine lasted six months before this happened. Parts are still in warranty, but the labor will not be covered. On the good side, I really like having both the the VCR and DVD in one unit. I would suggest people buy a combo unit from another manufacturer. Panasonic did not test this one enough before selling it."
2,Disappointing for Panasonic,"...I own many Panasonic products (answering machines, portaphones, cellphone) and have been pleased with the consistently high quality, design and longetivity of their products. However, I am disappointed with this product -- some minor annoyances like no tape/DVD counter/timer, complex 50+ button remote, BUT the darn thing doesn't accept all the VCR tapes -- it just rejects some (which play fine in other VCRs), not others. DVD works fine; good quality. EASY set-up; finished in less than 5 minutes. Display is skimpy on info."
2,bad description,"I purchased this kit expecting it to include installation hardware (springs, clips etc.) That is how I read the description. The brake shoes themselves are fine but there was absolutely none of the associated hardware included. You just get the shoes. This is NOT per the description so I will have to say buyer-be-ware on this one."
3,Men's orthotic oxford,"Seller is great - Shoes are a good value and are as advertised. However, the tongue of the shoe is oddly long making for a small ankle opening for a large shoe (16W) and is sometimes uncomfortable."
3,decent but ...,i really enjoyed the first movie.the cheerleaders..the other two barely kept my eyes open..i dont see how they should be sold as a set..clearly the first is worth the price of all three..i would still recommend buying them all jus because of the nostalgia of a bygone era
2,One out of three,The first one was okay. Sexy and retro. The other two were a waste of time and money. Buy The Cheerleaders separately. The revenge and swinging are edited so much they are a rip off.
3,3 Disks only one any good,The disks were miss labled. Only the first movie was any good the two sequals were awful. $35 is a rip for only one good movie.
1,great item until it stopped working,This worked for about a year of very occasional use. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Book was very helpful.,"This book review was submitted by a Roanoke Valley SQL Server Users Group member as part of the Book Review Program.Review by Will AshleyAs someone who doesn't know too much database stuff (just SP's and light administration things), I thought this book was very helpful in pointing me in the right direction and giving me a good overview of some of the new features of SQL Server 2005. I would not recommend this book to a SQL expert, as you probably know most of what is covered already. I like the way he has this book organized, it makes it easy to find the section you are dealing with. This book will be on my reference shelf if I need to figure out something in SQL Server 2005.Will Ashley"
4,Want a juicy turkey?,"We bought this to cook our Thanksgiving turkey, added a little water and it was the juiciest turkey we have ever cooked.The heat emits from the sides and it cooks evenly. We like the other features like the rack and removable cookwell. If it had a glass cover it would be perfect."
3,Shocked at the Box!!,"I haven't used it yet. But the shape the entire box came in was frightful. Completely came apart at 75% of the seams of the box it came in. I'm hoping when I do use it, there isn't anything wrong with it. I looked for awhile till I found the one I wanted at the price I was looking to spend. This box was so bad, UPS had a hard time taking it off the truck without it literally falling out."
1,Save your money,"This is a clear example of what an instructional or tutorial video should NOT be: a gentleman rephrasing the plugs' manuals and RANDOMLY moving faders and buttons to ""illustrate"" their function. No suggestions about when and why you would want to use each plug, or which parameters you could adjust to obtain X result. Nothing. It's like a teacher just reading aloud a text book to his class.As for the ""interactive"" part: you get none at all (unless you consider ""interaction"" choosing which chapter you want to watch at any given point in time).You're better off just reading the Waves manuals and experimenting with the plugs yourself. This video does not provide one single bit of information that you could not get yourself this way.On top of it all you get an annoying voice-over that sounds utterly self-conscious, forced and fake, more like a radio host or commercial announcer than someone trying to help you learn.All in all, a very poor product."
2,Disappointed boys!!,"My oldest son bought this set for his younger brother as a 6th birthday present after searching online for a set of John Deere toys. Both boys were waiting daily for the mail carrier to bring it. Today it arrived . . . they were SO excited to open the box, only to find that the set pictured next to the item description on Amazon.com is not what we received. The picture shows 10 vehicles; the set only contains 5. Tonight I came back to Amazon to check into why we did not receive what we ordered, and in fact it states way down the page in the product description that the set only contains 5 vehicles, and you as the purchaser can not pick which set you will receive. I have two disappointed boys here, and will likely return this purchase."
5,Very Inspiring,"Craig Nelson is right: ""studies"" are essential to learn painting and evolve into a good painter. It helps to get to the essence of your subject. I do not know any good painter who did not spend years painting before becoming really good.This book does not have the perfect title but is excellent in content. The 60 minutes are what it takes to be in tune with what you are painting and finding ways to improve your artwork.Each lesson presents a different challenge, and also leads you to explore a full spectrum of techniques. Perfect book to get you started on the ""right brush""...and get you really in awe of the whole process."
5,Great Method to Paint,"This is great book to sharpen your skills as a painter. I feel it's better suited for intermediate to profesional artists. The theory behind quickstudies is to make you decide what is or not important in a painting in a limited time span. To be honest, it took a lot of timed paintings to get used to the speed of a quickstudy. It definitely has helped loosen me up and not paint too tight from the getgo."
5,Have bought this book 3 times!,"I keep lending it out and they keep it!This book helps you understand the process of becoming a better painter and then shows you how.I have a BFA in painting and have applied the concepts with exciting results.I review the book several times a year for inspiration...usually before a vacation or three day weekend.I have shared with beginner painters and they get the process and techniques too.Not lending this copy out, they can visit the library."
3,somewhat helpful,"I thought this book to be somewhat helpful but really didn't learn anything profoundly new. I loved a few of the paintings but overall other than reinforcing the theme of painting everyday it didn't excite me. It's an alright beginner's or entrance level intermediate artist's manual but there are better oil painting books for beginner's or the advanced intermediate artist such as Bill Creevy's book, Vicki McMurty's or Kevin MacPherson's. I found them to be more beneficial and cover more artistic ground in the areas of color theory and painting structure."
3,For Beginners,"paintings are mostly done from pictures, paintings look stiff and edge control is not that great in all the paintings. The way the book is written is not all that great."
2,60 Years to better paining.,"Yeah, right... I read this book and was completely overwhelmed. The author thinks I can do a painting like this in 60 seconds?I don't think so. Thanks for trying. I would sell this book in a heartbeat...but my husband likes it... so on the shelf with other "" How to books"" ... It remains."
5,Fits like a glove,"Bought this replacement chuck guard for my malco turbo shear. The old one got torn, but this replacement fit like a glove. Don't really know what else to say its just a chuck guard."
1,Jet Stream fast but doesn't last.,"The Jet Stream is great if you want dinner on the table fast. But if you want a tabletop convection oven that will last more than six months don't buy this one which is almost entirely made of plastic, and almost impossible to clean."
2,Hit or miss,"I bought this to connect to my mp3 player, and for no apparent reason the results for this are all over the board. At times the sound quality is acceptable (don't expect it to be good). Often, though, the sound is so full of static that it is unlistenable. This is even during talk-only podcasts, at low volumes. I'm looking for another alternative."
5,total exitement,"The dj's mixing, the crowd yelling, what is difrent from the others, well its love parade. Imagine yoursef in aparty where the people, the surroundings and basically anything that you see is this new world that has represented freedom and unimaginable emotions since the berlin wall was taken down. Great dj dave ralph words were simple ""if we can create 10% of the exitement that we have created here then we've done our job"". you will see the beutifull conection between performers and crowd as you listen to this album. Take for granted that it will be part of the history of rave music and germany itself."
5,Hot CD!!!,"This is a great CD! The only problem is that it is a 2 disk set and the 2nd CD sucks, but the first is off the hook! My friend got this CD in Berlin for hella cheap! I would still however pay the $32 if CD burners didn't exsist. I suggust finding a friend who will split it with you and burning a copy for you or your friend. But buy it and enjoy it, its a great CD!!"
3,snackmaster,Received my snackmaster in good time and used it the next day. It dries fruit well and we have made some good beef jerky. Would recommend this product for home use. Works fine.
1,Did not work.,This was a waste of time and money. I ended up giving it away to someone hoping they could get it to work.
5,Just what I wanted,"This was exactly what I needed. I cut some fruit and put a little lemon juice on it. I turned it on (it was a bit noisy, it sounds a lot like a microwave) Then I went to work, I came home just over 5 hours later and all my fruit was absolutly perfect. Some of it was ripe and it turned out one way, some was a little underripe and it turned out another way, but both taste great without a hint of lemon. The only down side is my item came in its retail packaging, with no protective styrofoam. But it came in flawless working condition, so it seems durable enough to me."
3,its ok,it shuts off about every three hrs because it gets to hot then wont turn back on till it cools down enough
1,Could not rate zero,"Do not buy this dehydrator. After three uses, the fan became markedly noisier; during the fifth use, the fan and heating elements quit entirely! NESCO's warranty only offers the opportunity to spend more money on a defective product. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."
1,"Well, it was cheap!",I bought this four years ago and just used it for drying apples for a few days in the fall. It worked fine and was easy to clean. It still looks like new but the motor quit yesterday. I took it apart to see if it I could clean the contacts or somehow fix it. No way! It's a throw away motor like those in cheap hair driers. Everything is soldered or riveted. Made in China of course. Maybe I could buy another head unit from Nesco but who knows how long it would it would last. It's the cheapest Model Nesco makes so I guess I got what I paid for though. So I'm now in the Market for something more durable. Something made in the U.S. perhaps.
2,Just ok,"I was super excited to get this and make some beef jerky, and I was very dissapointed in it. It ran hot, loud and took forever. I followed the instuctions/reciepe and still didn't come out right. The jerky wasn't that bad, but for the time it took and how worried I would be while using it over night, is not worth it."
1,Self-immolated,"I used this dehydrator for about two years. It was a bit noisy, but it usually got the job done. Last night, however, I came home to a hazy apartment with an odd smell. Somehow, the plastic above the heating part had caught on fire. I was extremely fortunate that the small fire had been contained to the device and put itself out. But my room was covered with little bits of black plastic and ash. I will be replacing the dehydrator with a different brand."
1,Worst dehydrator ever.,I use this brand new dehydrator..right out from the box...the fan stop working ..within 15 minutes ...I hit the top with my hand..it went back on..only to stop again..this went on for a while...I can't send it back..because the return policy..has lapsed...I had it stored in my closet for 6 months.
4,Worked as indicated.,"Reviews from several years ago indicate that this does not ship with fruit leather trays - this is no longer correct. I ordered mine in 2011 and it arrived with a fruit leather tray for each tray, as well as a mesh liner for each tray (for drying small items).I've used it to dry some herbs (the lowest setting) and it worked fine and took as long as indicated in the instructions. It is no louder than the lowest setting on a regular fan.The one misleading fact about the description of this item is that it says it's 5 trays. It's really only 4 trays plus the bottom. You might be able to dry some things on the bottom, but they wouldn't receive the same kind of circulations that the other trays receive. You receive a fruit leather liner and a mesh liner only for the four trays.I may try to use the bottom tray to dry in the future and if it works well, I will revise up to 5 stars for five usable trays, as advertised."
2,Thought it would do better,"I bought this product thinking it would save me money by making dehydrated treats for my 2 dogs( who are on an all raw,natural diet). After trying it a couple of times the cost was the same as if I would go to store and buy them.I also thought that this one is a little on the noisy side."
4,Great for Beef Jerky,"I bought this little dehydrator about a year ago because I wanted to try making beef jerky.On the plus side, the dehydrator does a really great job. I have only made beef jerky, but it is outstanding. The trays are big enough to handle quite a bit of beef. I bought extra trays and I can fit 4-5 lbs of meat in a batch.The only minus is that it's a little noisy (about like a microwave or a little louder). The smell of the food sort of permeates the house when in use, and it takes 5-6 hrs to make the jerky. So, I tried putting it our guest bathroom with the vent on, but it overheats and stops working in enclosed spaces.Overall it is an awesome unit. It makes me wonder what is so great about these $100+ units I see. I recommend this for the casual dehydrator."
5,Great machine,I ordered this machine to preserve the herbs from our garden. I dehydrated 5 trays of basil in as little time as 40 minutes. The herb retained its wonderful aroma and flavor. I'm going to try fruit next. Glad I bought it.
4,Works great.,"The only bad part of this, is that it includes only four trays. Extra trays cost $15 a piece, plus SH. Save yourself some time and buy two! Other than that, it works great."
3,"Easy to clean, but quit working the second time I used it","I love that the fan is on the top and the whole thing is very easy to clean.I only use a dehydrator once a year, but it is for 12-18 hours in a row. This model quit working the second year I used it. I don't think it can handle the long hours."
3,Adequate,"Reason for ""par"" rating is no fault of Amazon. Product arrived with some damage, supports between several vents in top were broken. This was most likely due to packaging. I was in desparate need of device so I glued it back together rather than attempt to return it. After repair made it has functioned as implied and I have been pleased with results. This product qualified for ""free-shipping"" and I was very surprised (Pleasantly) at the speed it was delivered. Amazon has lived up to my expectations in several purchases. I will continue to recommend them."
5,Nesco American Harvest works great,Used it for the first time on strawberries and they came out just like candy. It runs quiet as advertised. I'll be investing in the extra trays! Can't wait to dry pears in the fall.
5,Wonderful,"We truly love our dehydrator and have made many things from beef, turkey and buffalo jerky to fruit leather. May have to buy another!"
5,Great Dehydrator for dog treats and dried fruit,"I purchased this after spending too much money on chicken dog treats at local stores. I now can buy chicken breast, and even thighs and use this and its a great way to help me save money with my six dogs and their treats- I also dried some apples, they were awesome- Excited to use more!"
5,I love it,"This dehydrator heats evenly and quickly, I added two extra shelves from my old dehydrator and it didn't increase the time. My old one was loud, this one seems to be quieter and it also has a feature that acts like a temp. control so the machine will get to temp. and then the fan slows down, when needed it turns the fan back up.Great product - I couldn't find this in any store they have similar products but they don't work nearly as well."
4,"Great ""Man Gift""","I got this for my boyfirend last Christmas and he flipped for it. He had a lot of fun experimenting with recipes, mostly to make jerky. His disdain for reading directions has not dampened his enjoyment of the product; it's really easy to use. A programmable timer would be nice, but for the price, this product is one of the best buys I saw, hense me selecting it.The dried bananas and pineapples are the only things that didn't come out, but that could have been operator error. The noisy fan seems like it wouldn't be a big deal, and honestly if you just run it overnight it's barely noticeable. I guess my only real complaint is that his apartment now always smells like beef jerky. Of course he and his roommates don't see that as a bad thing at all."
5,The Difference,"I would just like to tell you i HATE Warcraft II. I played it for about 10 min and got bored. I love the other blizzard games Starcraft and Diablo. Well at my local cybernation i decided to play Warcraft III. I was so impressed with the gamei played it for 3 hours there. I went home and then stait to Best Buy and bought the game. The game has such good graphics and i liek how you can zoom in. There are different races but they are not that different. Also, you can have a hero that levels up."
2,Poor game................,"As a fan of RTS games, especially of the series of Warcraft and starcraft, this game was very disapointing. They story line is pretty much the same of warcraft 2, the game speed is a little faster and better graphics, but still graphics look cartoonish and childlike.I recommend Starcraft or Age of Empires 2, instead of Warcraft 3. I hope that if Blizzard, someday, tries to bring to the market Warcraft 4, they have to put effort in creativity and more mature graphics."
1,Over-Hyped and Priced,"WC 3 is a good game, but it is over-hyped and definitely OVER-PRICED!!! How can anyone give 5 stars to a game that cost $... Blizzard is taking advantage of people who have been waiting since WC2 and SC. My advice is to wait for the price to drop before giving it a try."
4,Warcraft 2.9,"Yes, the graphics are stunning. The story is deep and involving but at the end of the day you are playing Warcraft 2 with bells on! This is not a bad thing and Blizzard have done a magnificent job as I understand that they can't stray too far from thr original idea. It's just, half way through, you think, mmmm, I've been here before and I've done all this before. For Warcraft fanatics that's great, but for the rest of us it wears a little thin. I was looking for a bit more, there is, but not much. The way you switch races throughout the story to play their campaigns IS different and does hold your attention. However, when all is said and done, when you're in a massive melee and all you're doing is madly clicking on various character icons to increase health/add magical powers etc. etc then you might as well be playing 2. Don't get me wrong, Blizzard have done a lot to bring this game into the modern gaming area and it shows but just don't expect too much from what you already know."
2,Gameplay has been done before. No real innovation.,This game is nothing more than a remake of warcraft 2. If it weren't for the new graphics I'd call it an expansion pack. The main flaw in this games gameplay is the fact that almost every strategy is based upon massing units. If you're not good at constantly queing up units you're doomed. Very little micro is required in this game. Other than knowing how to constantly produce units your best bet for winning is memorizing the various abusive strategies that are based on this games many imbalances.There is one upside to this game and that is the map editor. It allows you to edit just about everything about the game with relative ease. I spend almost all my time playing custom mods that aren't even similar to the actual game.If you want a real RTS that's innovative and has strong gameplay and an emphasis on tactics get Battle Realms.
1,This game messed up my iMac OS9,"Haven't any other users had this problem? Installing this game required me to change the settings in the extensions folder, which disconnected my internet service. I finally had to trash the game from my system, return it to the store for a refund, and buy Norton Utilities to repair the damage. My computer still isn't working properly. Whenever I try to shut down it gives me a message saying it can't because some application is running."
1,Patheric RPG w/ anti-RTS elements,"Quality over quantity emphasis too high, this imbalance ruins the game."
5,Amazing,"Although I have never played this game, it seems to outdue every aspect of RTS games. The simplified hero system i know will appeal to casual gamers like me who don't spend hours on rpg games and such, but it will also please hard-core gamers with hours of fun if thats what they want. The gameplay, centered on a smaller number of units than most rts games, will give the player more control over his entire race. The graphics are excellent, i have seen a few in game movies and the units move fluidly and naturally. The differences from most RTS games are what will seperate this from a good game to a great game. The neutral buildings, units,etc. will serve as a great new feature. Overall, I can not wait till this game comes out, it looks absolutely amazing and from what i hear plays just as well."
5,Top 5 Games EVER,"This game is a combination of Starcraft and Diablo. There are 4 different races to choose from. While getting resources and building with peasants, you create armies and support them with heroes. Heroes get stronger as they fight so there is constant action, so fast mouse movement and thinking is advised.Besides having a great single player mode, the multiplayer is done nicely by battle.net. You can chat, join ladder games, play team games, and gain levels and experience with your account. It's really unique.This game is very graphic and CPU intensive so a fast CPU (p4) and a good video card (64 mb) as well as plenty of memory (512 mb) is recommended by me for the BEST possible gaming experience."
3,Way too much addictive,"I've bought this game on day of release immediately. The day I bought it, I went to sleep at 2:00 AM, but I couldn't, I saw fire thrown at me, and my hero holding his hammer and killing others. You see, the thing is with this game is that is too much addictive. I mean way too much, the next day, I, slept at 4:00 AM, I just wanted to finish the damn level.I like RTS that is fast paced, light, absorbing, but surely not addictive."
3,the much awaited game,"I have a been a dedicated starcraft player, as well as Diablo, and Diablo II, and before those, warcraft II, however, after the amazing adavances they made in those other games, I found warcraft III was a big let down. It didn't improve that much after all those years it has been in the making.I appreciate that they have created heroes, and a fourth race to play, and tried to put them in 3-d graphics, and also made it possible to change the views. But I just didn't find it as great a game as all the hype makes it up to be. It's an interesting game that I will enjoy playing, but if I had to choose between this and starcraft, starcraft would win anyday.This game is a great game, and an enjoyable play, however don't have too high of hopes and just enjoy it for what it is. An interesting game that mixes RTS with different game elements."
3,Blizzard disappoints,"In all of my time spent gaming, I have never seen more hype surrounding the release of a video game than with Warcraft III. I suppose it would be difficult for any product to live up to that kind of hype, but I was especially disappointed by Warcraft III. I never have been a huge fan of the Warcraft series, but decided to give this one a try based on how awesome it sounded. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver. The game comes with steep system requirements, and I don't really see why. The graphics are good, don't get me wrong, but I don't really think they show the improvement in technology they should since Blizzard's last game, Diablo II. Also, W3 doesn't have the addictive power that is such a trademark of Blizzard games. I was entertained at first, but have gotten bored of the game now. It is still a very impressive game, but in the opinion of this one gamer, it fails to deliver in the areas which make Blizzard stand out."
2,"If you are new to RTS games, avoid this title","Campaign mode:Is the best of the game. The graphics are awesome, evenbetter of the own WoW.The campaign explains to you many things of the warcraft universe.Custom game:One downside the 4 races may seem unbalanced.You need experience in RTS games to win a match,if you are new to RTS games, be ready for a lot of defeats."
4,"Chaos in Azeroth, Indeed","The long awaited arrival of ""Warcraft III"", was the wait worth it? If you compare it to the hype for Diablo II (which in my opinion fell far short of the original), then yes. Single player game is greatly improved with great cinematics, fewer mission requirements and instead of those huge battles, smaller skirmishes. Plus, adding a feature from Starcraft, heroes with special abilities that learn and adapt as the campaign continues. A little pricey for a PC game, but what the heck, it's only money."
3,warcraft 2 was better,"you play a couple ""tutorial"" scenarios with the orcs...then you get to play the whiny human prince. the prince turns bad, and you get to play him again for the undead scenarios. i stopped playing shortly after the undead scenarios started, i had enough of the whiny emo prince.other then that, the hero system was ok, could have been so much more, made me a little disappointed. turned into just an average game with a poor story and cast."
4,VERY GOOD GAME,"It's indeed a very good follow up of the previous warcraft a bit easier than previous warcraft but i recomend it, No Doubt!!! GOOD CHOICE!! Go ahead and buy it"
2,eh... very so-so,"the graphics aren't that good and the game is corny and unoriginal, it brings nothing new to these kind of games."
2,Over priced RPG,"This game is much closer to a RPG than a RTS. Which is fine if you like hack and slash games like blizzard's Diablo 2. It's like they tried to mix Starcraft (not strategy just mass units) and Diablo 2 (hack and slash). Unfortunately these types don't mix well. The multiplayer is not that fun, and oddly enough the campaigns are the best aspect of the game..."
2,I was hoping for more,Buy Age of Empires instead (or Diablo ii if you want to stay with Blizzard.) Visually it looks and sound good but...The single player campaging mode is okay but the character development is disturbing (who wants to be a necromancer?.) Playing the scenario mode isn't a lot of fun as the beasties get killed off early. It can't seem to decide between being an rpg or a combat sim. I loved Warcraft 2 because it showed some evolution and was fun to play. This is just plain weak.
3,Basically WC2 with a few extras and a new skin,"Basically this is WC2 with fancier graphics. Of course those nice graphics would be better if you could pan/zoom the camera to see some detail. Nodda.If you are too young to remember WC2 then you'll probably think this is the best thing since sliced bread. Otherwise, if you are a long time WC player you'll probably ask ""This took 5+ Years to develop? What the heck were those guys doing all that time?....."" They have a nicer storyline, but after spending [money] you'll ask yourself exactly what did I get here a video clip or a game?I gave it 3 stars just because WC2 deserves at least that."
5,Fantastic Game,"This truly is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.The Gaming:The gaming style is much like Age of Empires but a little more fast paced, with several very addictive and fun game modes such as ""Footies"". The gaming is well done and is very player oriented with custom maps. The Customization is one of the very best things about the game, being able to create truly huge maps, even your game modes and units, is truly astounding. The graphics will most likely (IF your like me) open your imagination, with it's smooth textures (Although a little cartoonish) will impress you as it did me. The servers seem to always be active, with thousands of players online 24/7 (Even on holidays Christmas Holloween etc.4/5(-1 for Blizzard's terrible service.)"
2,Sickened,"I suppose this must be repetitive, but it needs to be said :The graphics are a little to hokey, cartoon-like; which quite frankly doesn't appeal to me.The gameplay : Well, lets just say the little ""hero"" thingisn't very original. Coming from the ""founder"" of RTS, I wouldhave thought something original would come with this game.All that happend was a theft.Neutral buildings? Eh, this is starting to look like Heroes ofMight and Magic 3. Quests? The bandit stole my ledger!Nonsense..."
5,Game review,"When you get a new game, you will usually play or it for 3 days or if it's really good, maybe a month. However I think, Warcraft 3 can be one of the most addicting games of all. The only way you would not like this game is if you don't like challenging games or if you get bored easily. This game is an adventure; there are lots of battle's and violence. There is a whole story mode that can be won. The whole entire point of the game is to win battles and quests, the game is bloody, but not what you think. The blood looks very fake, so who ever is playing won't go crazy. You don't have to play Warcraft 1 or 2 to be able to play warcraft 3, it is your choice. The best part of the game I could play the whole entire game for a day if I could. I recommend this game for people to 11-20."
1,BORING!!!,"This game is [not fun]. I bought this game the 2nd day it came out, being a long time fan of blizzard. But this game is just absurd. I played this game for about a week, and then found myself saying...""I want my money back"" The rpg mix that they've added makes the game so dull and empty, that it just lacks depth. The camera angle is the most annoying thing ever, and you can't do anything about it. I'd say, avoid this game altogether. I suggest Age of Mythology, which looks to be the game of the year."
5,Amazing RTS. As good as starcraft but better. Great graphics,"This is the best RTS on the planet. I am a big fan of Blizzard games and have beaten Diablo II, Starcraft, and Warcraft II countless times. This game is simply great. The campaigns are unique and not tedious, and the multiplayer is fantastic. Good for any age as the difficulty level can be altered, normal for beginners and hard for guys like me. the four races are completely different and offer unique gameplay with each one. Of course the orcs are the best. (I am a long-time orc fan. even from the original Warcraft.) Everyine should buy this game. Even if you didn't like starcraft(all three of you) this game has everything starcraft does and much more. Bottom line: buyit. Now.--Jay"
3,Blizzard production values,"Warcraft3 is a good game for sure, but most of the time it just feels like 'DiabloCraft', or more specifically Diablo + Starcraft + heroes + 3d engine. I agree with most of the observations by Jiayan Xiang (see below):1) The graphics are very nice, but have little bearing on unit behavior.2) The units in starcraft are much more varied and interesting imo.3) The campaign structure seems fragmented since many characters disappear without any resolution or many key players we only hear about through dialogue. Expansion pack considerations or not, it could've been handled better.4) Many aspects of the story/background were lifted from starcraft. Makes sense, since it was penned by the same guy who wrote the starcraft space-opera. Sometimes it was like deja-vu.Artistic taste aside, some of the dialogue is just awful, melodramatic. Shakespeare, this is not."
5,WC3 is dead :(,"Unfortunately WC3 is dead online. No one plays anymore. All there are are bots hosting games no one joins because they are games that people did not like for one and even so there's no one to play them either way. I bought this game just for battlenet and come to find out its almost completely gone. Great great great game but its dead now....if you do join however add me, weston178."
3,Quick to fix problem,"I ordered this product expecting a CD-ROM game for a PC which it clearly states it is a CD-ROM, clearly states condition as NEW, NEVER OPENED. I received a BOOK!. It came packaged in a Pre-order box from Best Buy that was clearly opened. If I could give negative stars I would. As far as contacting the seller, I received a e-mail back from the company stating they made a mistake because the item is list in the incorrect place. If it is listed in the incorrect place then the whole advertisement is wrong because they state they are selling a PC game. Seller did state they would refund all my money but I have to wait to see if it shows up on my C.C. After several e-mails and many apologies my money was returned and they let me keep the book. So all in all it turned out OK I might try ordering again from this company."
2,"Too complex, too difficult to master, too frustrating.","Yes, the graphics are good. Yes, the gameplay is smooth. Overall I like the concept. But unless you have 30 hours per week to devote to mastering this game, you will find it a tooth-grinding experience.Unless you are a hard-core gamer, and have no other life whatsoever, I do not recommend this game. The time investment to payoff ratio is just too steep."
1,is not a great game,"i used to play for weeks starcraft, what an excellent game, but W3 is a waste of time, its to easy, it is not better than age of empires 2, i just expected something amizing!! :(not even 2 starbetter get dungeon siege"
1,WAR CRAFT 3! (SO WHAT?),"SO it has ""enhanced graphics"" WHATS THE BIG DEAL? ITS THE SAME CANDY IN A DIFFERNT WRAPER! Oooooooooo it looks so new! Its still stuped your wasting time here! ..."
3,Couldn't keep me interested,"I have been a big fan of the RTS type of game, specifically other Blizzard titles like Warcraft I, Warcraft II and Starcraft. This one just didn't live up to the hype. I waited a long time for the next generation of Warcraft and found the graphics to be cool, but missed the older style of play. The multiplayer just didn't keep my interest."
5,The Review.,"This game is great. BUY IT NOW! Come'on, go. Its the best. Buy it on this site for a great price."
5,WHAT A GREAT GAME!!!,This is one of the best warcraft games I have played yet. the missions are horribly fun and the graphics are amazing!!!
5,LAN multiplayer is where it shines,"Single player Warcraft III is a lot of fun - there's some compelling missions and you can build up your heroes to a powerful level by the end of the campaigns. On normal difficulty it's a little bit easy though - try it on hard.Where Warcraft III shines though is in its multiplayer capability. LAN especially. Teaming up with or fighting against an experienced player (desirably a friend for maximum fun) is something you can do all day.There's too many good things to say about this game - it's a perfectly balanced, exciting, tense strategy game that requires thinking caps to be on at all times. After a tense game of multiplayer Warcraft III you'll be exhausted, infuriated, and ready for more!"
5,THE BEST,"i bought this game summer 2003 after i played a couple of skrimishes at my cousins and i was hooked right away.good graphics the campain kicks ass and the skirmish is good hoever the multiplayer is defently the strongest point in the game. you can face guys in quick setup that take abought 30 secs find a game and send you to it and then if you get bored of the normal games then just go to custom games and there is a list diffrent games created by world edit (another exelent part of the program) they have games like lord of the rings, (look for a helms deep game it kicks ass) starcraft, resident evil and of course other creative games footman wars. over all there are almost no downsides (atleast none that i can think of at the moment)so those people that gave a low rating suck. BUY THIS GAME AND THE EXPANSION YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not what I expected,I have every single game from blizzard and i believe that this is one of the worst ones. It has a few annoying features like 90 food supply. which makes for small armies and it has an Upkeep feature that really ... I thought that the game was way to easy. i beat the entire campaign without losing once. Way to easy. It also did not take very long to do it.The game also was not very orginal i thought that it was pretty much the same as WarcraftII just with better graphics
2,Build and Rush build and rush build and rush build and rush,First man to rush wins. 12 minute games (MaX). This would have been a great game two years ago. Certainly not worth the 60 bucks. All your paying for right now is HYPE.
3,"Ok games tries to give you everything, tries...","I was a huge fan of Diablo II and Age Of Empires II. This game seemed to me to try to give you what is in both of those games. But it didnt quite deliver. I was very excited about the release of this game but when played it found it lacking for the following reasons:- population limit is VERY LOW- your heros level up but start back at level 1 every game- since you need to level up to stand a chance you have to be agressive from the start of the game.- the NPC just stand there, they should wander around, and once you have killed them all thats it, they dont regenerate.It's a good game for the gamer with moderate expectations, but if you demand the BEST from your gaming experience then, checkout the other two I mentioned. Spend the money and get both of those rather than this one. That way you will get everything your wanting."
1,I can't believe people like this thing,"Briefly:Pros: great graphics, interesting building concepts for the different races.Cons: terrible gameplay. Most of the time, you're not racing to outbuild the other guy, you're racing against how much gold you have. Also, troop limits of 90?? What the heck is with that? Probably a performance limitation, since when I got to 90 and had more than 2 other computer players things would bog down on my Duron 700/GF2. Now, if they came out with these graphics using the Cossacks game engine, we have had a winner. :-)"
4,It could be better? What would make WC3 better anyway???,"Yeah, from my experience with PlayStation 2, I think WC3 should have been better if came out in DVD instead of CD-ROM. Can you imagine PlayStation 2 with that specification could run great games likes Final Fantasy X & Dynasty Warrior, why computer couldn't? In my humble opinion, great games for computer should able to be played even in low end systems. I'm iBook 700 user, because some reviews from particular website make me doubt about WC3 performance in my computer.Please, why you all computer game developers don't want to make game in DVD format???"
5,Warcraft 3 and how cool it is,"Warcraft 3 is BY FAR the most interesting RPS I have ever seen, and ever will see. I played it at a friends house, and thought that the design and interface is extreme. 4 races duke it out to the death, with all new units and buildings. I can't wait till it comes out, June 26, 2002, and I'm gunna get it the first day it comes out, you should too."
5,great game!,"I played this game for half an hour and i already knew i was going to get it. the gameplay is fantastic, and the graphics are wonderful. with the population cap at 90, and some units taking more that one food to build, it makes your management of units far more important in the outcome of the game. BUY!..."
3,More RPG than RTS,"I've been really looking forward to this game. I've played both the warcraft and starcraft game(s), and wanted to see what they would do with warcraft and modern technology. I was upset with all Blizzards usual delays, and their removal of aspects from the final game, due to the fact that would cause more delays, but I was still really hoping to like this game. Unfortunately this game is much closer to diablo than any rts.It includes no original play aspects. This is actually its best quality. Blizzard is best at taking another game and making it better.This is first blizzard game with really great campaigns, so you won't end of cheating to see the cutscenes, which are by the way some of the best in any game to date.I just wish that the rest of the game could be as good as the visuals. Oh and by the way, The funny commentary is back for those of you like clicking."
1,Rediculous.,"They call this a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game?? Give me a break. This isn't a strategy game, it's a ""Who can build the best hero in the shortest time period"" game.The graphics are childish and the single player game is a waste of time.Multiplayer isn't much better... I grew tired of the enemy showing up at my town in 90 seconds. It is far too easy to powerup and thrash your opponents in 2-3 minutes. Strategy? There isn't time.I'm sorry I spent the money on this overpriced game, but at least I got 1/2 of it back on the trade-in."
1,TAKES UP THE ENTIRE COMPUTER'S RAM! DONT WORK WITHOUT 128MB!,"I just bought this game today, and put it in, it didnt work. it takes a min. of 128 MBs of ram, THAT IS MY ENTIRE COMPUTER! it is a great game so ive heard, it looks like a GREAT game! but i cant play it without buying another computer. but, Warcraft 2 was EXCELLENT! so i'd bet this is even better. sooo,,, i'd highly recomend it! (that is...if you have enough ram and stuff)"
1,Horrible Game,"This game was the worst blizzard game i ever played. The messed up the entire strategy gaming idea. The RPG they mixed into the game was unbelievably horrible. They should have kept the rpg out. Blizzard is turning this game into Diablo. Some of the features were nice, but otherwise single player is the worst. Multiplayer is ok, they should have kept the game like StarCraft, plain and simple, but awesome. They messed up the entire story. Blizzard better not make StarCraft 2 like this. You shouldn't buy this game, it is a big disappointment."
3,Release it soon,"o.k. we've heard this is oin to be the reatest ame of all time, right, but will they ever release it? I thouh this was supposed to be out in it seems so long ago, but if i remember riht it was 1996, or 1997. I want to get this game, in fact i'll probably be the first one in line to et this game, but i would you really believe them when they say they're oin to release this, i still play on battle not, with warcraft 2, and against my friends at home, but you have to wonder, will they ever release this game, I sure as hell think soBLIZZARD GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!"
2,A great game,"This game is a lot of fun and has a relatively good storyline. There are a few things which I think could be better.1) The writing was anoying. They kept using the word young over and over. ""You must lead your people to Kalimdor, young sorceress"" ""young warcheif"" ""young prince"".2) I realy realy wish Blizzard would ban swearing and insulting people on Battle.net. This is a huge dissincentive to play online.Besides these two things, the game is very fun. It actualy deserves 2.5 stars."
4,"Not as fun as II, but much better looking","... I also played the original Warcraft, ...Between the two, I would say Warcraft II beats III for itsGameplay enjoyability, plot depth & interest, and the MUSIC!!!Warcraft III beats II as far as the game interface, the graphics, the reasonable challenge, the plot clarity, and the good sound effects.As far as the Cast Of Characters: Warcraft III has characters that are way more involved in the game and plot than before. however, none of them develop very much likeable personality. One of the heros basically turns undead and murders his father, which IMO was a violent anticlimactic moment. From that point onward all of the music is terrible and annoying.World editor ease of use: Warcraft IIWorld editor overall: Warcraft III... However, WC III is an excellent game still, and there is no other game like it out there that I know of.Here is why I gave it 4 stars:GRAPHICS: A+GAMEPLAY: B+NTENSITY: BPLOT/STORY: B-MUSIC: DSOUND FX, VOICE: A"
3,Disappointing,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but I liked Warcraft II much better. I don't care for Battlenet because then the game is no longer a strategy game and becomes a race to produce fighting units. In Warcraft3 I finished the Human campaign, played a couple of chapters of the Undead Campaign, and lost interest on the game. The main problems that I have with this game are the following:1 - Resource management is not as critical as in previous Warcraft and Starcraft games2 - The Heroes are just too powerfull and over power anything else. No longer you need a nice balanced force.3 - There are no water units, which added more strategic depth in Warcraft II4 - Air units are kind of wimpy5 - They switched from the Apple media player to the Microsoft one, which does not run in older machines6 - A lot of compatibility issues with CD-ROM driversI was very disappointed by this Warcraft game. I recommend instead ""Imperialism"" for those who enjoy extreme resource management and strategic planning."
4,Fun!!!,"Fantasy like world with heroes and orcs, trolls, that sorta thing. Is made by the same company, Blizzard, that makes Diablo and Starcraft. Become the night elves, undead, orcs, and humans. Has missions and custom games. Very neat."
5,king of games,"this is the king of games best game in its kind (rts) and the next episode to the game of the year 1995. the graphics are great, the voices are funny, the stroy is good, the gamplay is good and you can do almost everything with the editor"
2,Sub-Par for the insane hype,"I feel like anyone giving this game 5 stars has been paid off by Blizzard, lackies, all of you! This is a step down from the wonderful platform that Blizzard created. The limited food supply gives you the smallest army you can imagine. The hero units are the most worthless thing they could've added. The game puts too much basis on this single unit, when you should really be worrying about your army. Why did Blizzard have to have Diablo on their minds when they made this? why couldnt they just let them be two sepearte games. Don't worry, when CnC Generals hits the shelves, WCIII is going to be in the discount bin...in no time ; )"
4,Blizzard does it again,"I'm only 3 or 4 hours into the game, and I'm addicted. Blizzard seems to do a quality job on all their games. This one seems to be a great game AND have great video between scenarios. I can't wait to play online - which is often more fun than the one-player scenarios."
4,Pretty Good....,"I got warcraft 3 from a friend quite a while ago, last summer during July. And I can't say I was disapointed, incredible cinematics, very good gameplay and intresting storyline. The music is very cool! Yet, there is some drawbacks. It doesn't sound so good, yet the ingame graphics are great for a stragedy game. It ran fine on my computer. It ran kinda slow some times, but most of the time it ran normal and some times fast. It requires An Pentium II 400Mhz, 8mb 3d directx8.1 video card, bla bla bla and so on. You can view the system requirements for PC and MAC when visiting the WarCraft III item. Any stragedy game fan-this is your game to purchase! I truly recommend it!! =]"
3,"Good, but Red Alert 2 and StarCraft were better.","First of all the video scenes were great. The idea of heros and skill levels was cool. But the unit count limit and the upkeep make it annoying to play. The graphics are good, but the 3D is wasted. The units would be better if they didnt have so many things to use, simplicity in battle is best.Overall i liked it, but RA2 and SC were better by far."
5,STOP WHINING,"Dear lord everday that I come and review this game I hear about all these people who say this game is horrible and how they think that starcraft is better. Well I have one thing to say SHUT UP the game is great and just because its not as easy as starcraft yall dont have to cry. I played warcraft II,Warcraft II exp,Warcraft 3, and starcraft and I loved them all but just because yall are hooked on one doesnt mean the others have to .... Everyone in this world judge's some way or another and I dont see why we have to I mean there are some things you should judge but games hahaha if its good then it's good end of discussion.Hope this helped..."
3,"It's OK, but Starcraft is better.","Being a beta tester of warcraft 3, and also an experienced(2 year) player of Starcraft, I have come up the opinion that it just does not compare to STarcraft. The game is slow. With unit HP up so high, and all of the micromanagement done for you, it's boring too. There is some basic skill, but not a whole lot. With Starcraft, I've played for 2 years, and while I can beat most people, there are tons who will own me. I don't see the same thing with War3. You can learn it in a day, and master it in 2 weeks. The Hero idea is good, but it doesn't add much.I'm sure it is worth playing, and you will have fun for sure. But if you are looking for a high level of competition and difficulty, you might not get what you wanted."
3,I was disappointed,"I am not a game junkie like some. I just like to sit down and get into a great game that has a great story line and looks awesome. I don't need to be nit picky about every little thing.I have played these series since the very first original Warcraft Orcs & Humans. I have enjoyed each game for hours and was impressed with each new release and expansion.Then came Warcraft 3. I didn't like it at all. The look was pretty old school. Boxy characters, boring graphics, and difficult navigation.Some may love this game. My step son plays networked games nonstop. I moved on to other games after only a few levels. I didn't get into this one at all."
4,The Prophesying Guitarist!,"This is a truely amazing guitarist! His technique is out of this world!I always love listening to John-The are a few tracks here which show you a glimpse into what he can do-sorry but his style and speed, technique is really good.Good Cd for those who love guitar players!"
3,Beautiful Wood,"Arrived timely. The wood is beautiful. However, as another reviewer stated earlier, the handles were loose! I expected better quality for the price I paid . . . . I hated to send it back, so, I got out the ""Gorilla Glue"" and a toothpick, and now the handles are tight!"
2,Need better packaging?,"As with others, my tray arrived with a very loose handle, and so I will send back for a refund. This is either a flaw in workmanship or the way it is packaged, or both."
2,"Ok, but not great. Wouldn't purchase if I saw up close","The pictures look very nice and make the tray look like it is one piece, but it is not. Also makes it appear to have a bezel that and again is not. It it is made by the way the tray is put together.wood is very flimsy and I do not feel that this will have any longevity."
2,fell apart after a few months,This is not well designed as a bed tray or computer lap top base. After a few months the tray the side parts came off. I had to throw it away. too flimsy. I would not purchase again.
3,matte varnish,One tray was finished glossy and the other had a matte finish. They are supposed to be matching trays. It is as if they ran out of glossy varnish on one and sprayed the next one with a matte varnish.
4,"Very pretty, but...","It arrived broken, easily enough fixed with a little wood glue and clamps. Less hassle than returning it. The breakage was in the handling after manufacture. This speaks to the quality control. Very attractive But from my high school woodworking class I think the grains could be better matched up for a more attractive product. Not for heavy duty. Gosh, that could have also described my date from last week."
1,Extremely dissatisfied,"I received this product..The handles were moving, the glue was dried so it was falling apart, it weighed next to nothing, it was extremely poorly made, and cheap. I saw it in Woman's Day, expected it to be quality, and it was horrible. I will not be ordering from Lipper again if that's the way things are made."
1,Very Disappointed,"Finally received the item. Very slow shipping. The wood and the design are great BUT the quality of how it was put together was horrible. The sides were very loose. Too bad, I had planned to order another one but not now. I'll probably end up just throwing it away."
2,"Neat Design, Quality Sucks","These trays do not nest so need extra height to stack. They arrived, one broken, the other marked up. I would not recommend them to anyone."
3,Good Story Needs More,"I purchased this dvd because I had seen the movie years ago and wanted to have this one in my collection. It's a true story, which I like. It just needs more umph! in the movie."
2,A different experience,"I certainly had a different reaction to this pillow than other reviewers. It felt hard. My head hit bottom rather than being nestled. It had no loft once I put my head on it. Pillow comfort is a personal, individual matter. This did not do it for me. Others have evidently had a different experience. I'm back to my old fashioned pillows. I guess I'll just have to replace them more often, but I can get at least 5 for the price of this one."
2,Very Tall & Firm Pillow,"This pillow is rather tall and overly firm, which was too much for me. I tried it out for about a month and I always woke up with a sore neck and shoulders. It may work well for some people, but it was definitely not for me."
1,What a dissapointment!,"Bought this in Nov 2011. I am pretty good at trying to buy quality products and don't mind paying more ifi think the reviews are good.By june 2012, the pillow turned into jello. It does not come back to its original shape and it is lumpy.Don't waste your money. Not sure what else is out there but I'll chnge it in the next few months, after doing more research."
1,Not written by master Kuo,I have been studying with Simmone Kuo for 2 years. Sifu Kuo's widow. She warned me about this book because it was written without the families consent and it has almost nothing to do with the late Kuo Lien Ying.
4,This is really a great book,This is really a good book.Absolutely not for beginners.It is very deep in the analysis of almost all the Tai Chi aspects as you can see in the Book Summary listed by other reviewers. It really gave you material to think and work on.Anyway sometime there are terms not explained that could really mislead the meaning of the matter. That's the reason why only 4 stars. I really and strongly recommend this book to all the instructors and advanced practitioners whatever style they practice. This is a book that will forever give you Tai Chi insights each time you read it.
2,"Overly Complex, Occasional Tidbit","If you are researching Tai Chi then this book is a valuable tool for finding a few (and I do mean few) useful pieces to the puzzle. If you are looking for simple and easy to understand, or you are a novice to Tai Chi, Chinese, and Engineer Drawings then keep searching.The drawings in this book are ridiculously complicated. I have worked with engineering specs, blue prints, flow charts and a myriad of other scribbled communication and have never seen something that will make your head spin faster.The text is a mixed bag. In one corner you have pieces of the text that are legible and easy to read, offering useful information. In the other corner you have secret code that will put you to sleep in 30 seconds or less. The Yin Yang Theory was not designed as a style of writing!I think this book offers more than most but falls short in effective communication."
4,Cambridge PlayDock for Zen Vision:M,"I'm not an audio buff, so I couldn't tell you how this unit rates compared to a Bose system or whatever; however, to my untrained ears, the sound quality is very good - crisp, clear and much like the high-priced ""big sound/small system"" packages. Took me 10 minutes top to unpack, set up and understand -- easy controls. I read a review that stated the FM tuner did not work for the 30GB unit - not true for me; an antenna that plugs in to the top of my player came with the package and works as well as any other system in my house although there are a few stations a little further away that I can never seem to pick up from any other place than my car stereos. The overall appearance of the system is fairly low key - not built to be a centerpiece but to cleverly blend in with the surroundings. Very happy with purchase."
4,portable speakers,"Sound quality is good (not great), but the price was right. Easy to use and works well with my Zen."
2,Sub-Par,"Quality was not consistent with the price of this unit. My MP3 produces wonderful sound through standard earphones, so I was deeply disappointed with the performance. I am still seeking a docking station for my Creative Zen Vision M 30Gb.Any suggestions?"
4,"Small player, BIG sound","I have had my zen docking speaker for about a week now and am very happy with it. I am sort of a sound quality snob and own many Bose products and if Bose had a Zen visionM compatible speaker system I would already have it...but they don't..that I know of...so this will have to do for now and again, I am happy with it. I think it's well worth the money."
4,quality product,Gave our 14-year-old daughter this docking station for early Christmas present and it is nice. Setup and operation must be simple because she's never asked a single question. Sound quality is great - better than any boom box we purchased for her in the past. A little pricey for a docking station and fm radio compared to all the ipod products out there but I have no knowledge of their quality. This station does have a remote which is obviously handy for laying around in bed while playing your Zen that sits on your dresser. She controls all sound functions plus can search her play list with it. $170 was more than I thought I'd have to pay but there are few choices for the Zen mp3 players. I am happy with the sound and quality of the product though.
5,Zen docking speaker delivers,"A very nice amplified docking speaker unit for various versions of the Creative Zen Vison. Good sound, plenty of volume, handy remote. A handle built in to the upper rear surface of the unit makes moving it easy. I would recommend removing the Zen before moving the unit as the player could fall out."
3,remote functions limited with Zen V plus,"I recently bought a Playdock Zen. I found that the remote control back (left pointing arrow) and scroll (up and down arrows) functions do not work with the Zen V Plus player. I assumed the remote was broken, but I was told by Creative technical support that by design these functions do not work. This means that one cannot access, scroll through, or select from the menu, making the remote mostly useless. The documentation does not explain these deficiencies, but rather describes functions for all buttons on the remote. This product is poorly designed."
3,Annual jetstream oven expander ring replacement.,"I have owned several American Harvest Jetstream ovens over the past 15 years. While I really do enjoy cooking with them, they are not really designed for heavy duty use. The expander ring is just one of the items you must replace every year or two because they crack. I would be extremely happy and willing to pay more for the Jetstream Ovens if they were designed to last longer and were built of stronger materials that withstood heat and heavy usage."
5,Want to see Scotland,The Hamish Macbeth series is very enjoyable. The stories are light and easy to read. I love the characters and the setting of the stories. These books make me want to see the Highlands. There was a tv series based on the books - just as enjoyable.
3,Typical Hamish Maccbeth,This is a good book for fans of M.C.Beaton. It is an easy readin a simple style. It should satisfy all Hamish Macberh fans.
4,A Charming Cozy,"I have read all of the Agatha Raisin series, and I am a great fan of M.C. Beaton's style of cozy, but this is the first Hamish Macbeth book I've read. They are as different from Agatha Raisin as could be, but just as enjoyable. Macbeth is a poky Scottish village constable who appears to not know how to even tie his shoes, but when he sets his mind on discovering a murderer, he shows that he has a mind like a steel trap. He has the Miss Marple knack of being able to compare people and situations to those he is familiar with, and he has the added help of many relatives throughout the world that he can call on for information. In this book Hamish solves the murder of a very nasty woman who has come to the village for a week long fishing school. It turns out that she is a gossip columnist for a tabloid newspaper, and she is at this school to dig up dirt on the other students. A very nasty character indeed, and there is certainly no lack of suspects. Great fun!"
4,Lots of fun.,"Since I began reading these Hamish Macbeth mysteries out of order, it's given me a bit of perspective. In DEATH OF A GOSSIP, the early Hamish (c 1985) is funnier and more awkward, and Priscillla is even more fragile, airy, feminine, and perfect. The whole thing is a little more edgy than some later ones. Beaton creates really unlikable characters -- in this case, the gossip columnist is truly obnoxious. I would have killed her myself. But, unlike some other Beaton books, there's no sense of place this time -- that is, no sense of picturing exactly where everybody was. I always love Beaton's sense of humor. I laughed from page one: ""People who travel up here to the wilds of Scotland expect to be instructed by some great hairy Rob Roy, making jokes about saxpence and saying it's a braw bricht moonlicht nicht and lang may your lum reek and ghastly things like that."" All in all, a so-so mystery, but a very fun time with Hamish."
1,major disappointment,"I am always in favor of a light hearted mystery, but I was very disappointed in this book. While the descriptive language in this book is positively delicious, I found the characters to be mousy, nervous, unbelievable and annoying to the point that I didn't really care what happened to them. The mystery element was not very well crafted either; each of the characters was given motive for murder in a not-very-subtle way, there wasn't much in the way of plot twists, and suspense was very minimal. No goosebumps or delicious anticipation here, just disgust over unrealistic insipidity of the characters' actions. I could very happily have stopped halfway through without caring that I didn't know how it turned out. Don't waste your time, if you want a fun mystery read, try one of Diane Mott Davidsons culinary mysteries."
5,A good beginning,"This series was recommended to me by a friend and now I can't stop. I am enjoying summer with extra reading time for relaxation and pleasure. The books are light reading and easy to follow, humor throughout."
3,"A Light, Cozy, and Amusing Story.","This is my first time ever reading a M.C. Beaton novel, and I must say that I was impressed by the light-hearted, easy, and at times, humorous reading. I was only slightly put off by the Scottish rhetoric/vernacular, which compelled me to either reread a paragraph or seek the dictionary for further assistance, occasionally. Overall, I've become intrigued by the antics of the series' protagonist and look forward to reading more books from this author."
2,"Poor writing, no mystery","I tried an Agatha Raisin and now I have tried a Hamish Macbeth. No more shall I expect good writing from MC Beaton! I don't need to waste good reading time on characters with no substance, a vague plot and uninspiring writing."
3,Writing 101,Since I really enjoyed Dick Francis books I thought maybe this could be another good English writer series to start. Well this is her first book and another review said that they get better after this one but do I dare take the chance? This is a cookie cutter novel that had no orginality. I am struggling to finish it.
1,Yuck,"I really don't like this CD - the songs had a weird beat. There was almost no music, it was almost all singing. The songs had too many sound effects - probably about the first thirty seconds of track 2 was the sound of a tractor. Don't buy this CD. It stinks."
4,"Quirky, Fun, Fast","This book is a quick read that opens up with a suck-you-in plot revolving around the main character, Mary, finding her lover, Primo, Dead. The real story enfolds afterwards as Mary discovers more about Primo (and herself) than she ever knew when he was alive. There are a few unexpected twists and turns thrown in and some great realistic detail on the ""artsy"" lower NYC lifestyle. I was impressed that this was written by man considering how spot-on he was into my female psyche."
4,Tour the East Village,"Mary Bellanova comes home from work one day to find her boyfriend dead. She starts to track down his old girlfriends and finds she doesn't know as much about him as she thought. What follows is hilarious and touching while staying a frighteningly real look at life in the East Village of NYC. Arthur Nersesian develops a great (and occasionally-insane) female character that anyone can identify with. I picked up the book based on its front cover and my familiarity with the Tompkins Square Dog Run where a bit of the action takes place, but now I'm hooked on Nersesian's work. With my having just moved away from the East Village, this book is like coming home."
4,"Nersesian Does it Again, A Really Fun Book To Read","I really enjoyed this book. The dialogue was fast and snappy, the characters memorable. As usual, there's nothing too deep going on below the surface in any of Nersesian's books, but the writing is fantastic and the story is so interesting that you want to keep on reading until the very last page.The underlying humor and cynicism is great, especially when the main character in this novel is forced by circumstance to take a lousy job that requires the wearing of a dorky looking uniform. Everyone who has ever worked a lousy job serving the public will totally relate to that part of the book and this character's life.Once again, Nersesian's ability to capture the smallest details of life in New York are fascinating for someone like me who's never been to New York City. He makes the reader feel like they're actually walking through the streets with his characters, experiencing the same things they are."
4,good effort,"though some of the writing seems cliched, i enjoyed reading this book very much. in fact, i liked it enough to read it a second time. nersesian's prose is beautiful and made me laugh out loud several times. any book that can do that is worth a recommendation. plus it was fun to point out all the places i've been to that were mentioned in the book."
1,Doesn't Work,"WARNING: This does NOT work with the Pentax D-L18. The battery doesn't even fit in the charger. It's not worth sending back, either."
1,disappointed,"I expected this book to be entertaining and perhaps provide a few insights - boy, was I disappointed. According to Ms.Ayo, any white person with black friends is really a ""Negro renter"". This is insulting to me and to the friends I love dearly. Such a negative book, came away feeling sorry for an author who obviously is prejudice and bitter."
1,A white man's reiview.,"Ayo (forgive my capitalization) thinks she's smarter than she really is. I struggled to finish this monstrocity becuase it micorcosms the problem with race relations today: There is only skeptisism, no action, no hope. We don't need stuff like this. We need positive messages. The way Ayo is talking, blacks and whites will NEVER get along unless those stupid white people wake up and smell the negro. If you are white, stay far away from this steaming pile of dung. It couldn't be any more offensive if she tried. Take special care if you have black friends becuase, according to Ayo's ""satirism"", you are just faking it. You're nothing more than a 7th generation slave owner or ""negro renter"". I believe more people (white and black alike) should stand up against this kind of negativity and push for something more positive. How are we supposed to remedy race relations if people are putting out garbage like this. I'd give this book zero stars if it would let me."
1,Get Real,"I'm a white male who lives in Los Angeles. I'm also a writer. I also happen to spend a good deal of time in Ethiopia every year trying to make life better for the very weakest of those among us, children not only orphaned by HIV, but who are themselves infected.This book came off as trite and insignificant, in my view, and I would never recommend this waste of paper product. I would suggest to Miss Ayo that her next work point toward something positive and meaningful, not cloaked bitching.Believe it or not there are white people out there trying to make a difference towards the betterment of humanity, white and black."
1,Get a Life Again,I still say the this author is a racist and as to K. Spence's review-you are an idiot-of course Jews are a race. Try using the dictionary once in a while.
5,Serious Fun,"Try this at home -- it really works! You'll find the ""exercises"" very easy to follow. Hey, we've been doing this for centuries. Ms. ayo proposes a pay as you go plan.This book takes racist attitudes, and reverses the power/value structure to explode them. Brilliant! It is outrageous and makes you laugh at the same time."
1,A mean spirited and bigoted book,"I bought this because it looked funny, irreverent and possibly a bit discomfitting to liberal readers (of which I am one.)It is all these things at times, true.I came away from it feeling sorry for the author, to be honest. The more I read, the more her anger bled through the wit.She doesn't believe it is possible for people of different ethnic backgrounds to have anything remotely resembling an honest exchange on any level, whether a casual meeting or true friendship.Which is sad, inaccurate and bigoted.I threw the book in the trash when I was done."
5,I am a renter,"Sadly I have rented my share of people.In my desparate attempt to feel their pain, understand their plight, and relate to their day to day goings ons, I have in turn done a great deal of the things in this book.It is fun to laugh at oneself and still learn from it.A slap in my face and a healthy knock from my hypersensitive liberal high horse.Oh and to the self titled liberal, below who was finding the author's anger.. I sure hope in your rage induced disposal of her book that later you fished it out and recycled it!"
1,"Anti-American, politically correct garbage","When I read this book I was so disappointed at the author's attempt to paint Patriots as the bad guys! She has written a ""politically correct"" story of the Revolutionary War. Is there anyone out there who actually believes the British should have won, or retained control of the colonies? When I pointed out to my son's teacher the not-so-subtle message in the book, she removed it from the classroom. My advice: READ THESE BOOKS BEFORE YOU BUY THEM."
2,Not worth the money,"This was one of several Calico Critter houses my daughter received for Christmas three years ago. And this is the only one that I gave away the last time we moved. It simply isn't worth the money. Other houses and structures have more to them - lights or ways to move furniture, apples or slides - this was simply a ""school"" that looks nothing like a school. The books are just about impossible to put together as they are made solely out of a thin cardboard and they flatten too easily. (I still have my books from when I was child ... and Calico Critters was known as Sylvanian families ... so my daughter played with my old set of plastic books. Why can't they just make the same books they were making 20 years ago??) If you are buying Calico Critters items, pass on this one. Everything else we have purchased is just adorable and sooo much fun to play with. It's great to see another generation enjoying these little animal families!"
4,what fun!,This school house was a huge hit and went with the townhouse that Santa brought. It has lots of cute little parts that make the whole thing realistic. It took 30 seconds for my four-year-old granddaughter to be completely taken and for her imagination to take over.
4,a crowd pleasing hit!,"I have 4 children ranging from 7 to 2 and 1/2. This nursery school is an absolute hit in my house! I do agree with the majority of the reviews in that it is a pricey toy. However, my children absolutely love it and enjoy playing with it together! I love the detail of the calico critters collection. I did end up throwing a lot of the paper accessories away because they were quite small and fragile. However, overall I am happy I went ahead and purchased it despite the rather poor reviews since my children enjoy it so much."
3,Where are all the little pieces?,"No cute accessaries here, which is part of the appeal of Calico Critters. Just 2 babies,(no teacher), 4 desks, 2 plastic boxes and a bunch of cardboard books, blocks and papers. It was a present so we'll keep it. I was a little disappointed but my three year old is happy, I guess that's all that matters."
5,A scent from heaven!,"Immediately, when you apply this lotion or this scent in any form, you're bound to get compliments. My boyfriend loves this scent on me so much that he bought the perfume set along with more lotion. It's a very clean scent, yet it has a versatile range from a cinnamon to floral. I'm excited every time I wear this scent."
3,Can't Be Denied,"For Rod Stewart, he had truly a lot that he had to fight for in 2001, physically from his voice and his rhythm. Rod survived throat cancer, and also a reach to his fans. That came by in same respects with one of the tracks he introduced, I Can't Deny It, the first track from his last record with Warner Brothers, Human. The song is a very strong song at first, but I don't think a lot of people would really have gone for Rod at the time. I still think it is one of Rod's best tracks in quite some time, but not really as good as some of his earlier songs from the 90's. All that I can say with Rod, is that he needs to keep going with the musical groove he's made with his new standard style. It has worked more than it has ever done for him."
1,Who edits these concerts???,"When I watched this concert on television I thought that the highlight was when Cher and Cyndi Lauper duetted on ""If I Could Turn Back Time"". It was one of those magic moments but it has not been included on the DVD. Why???"
1,What??? Poor decision and lame dvd!!!,"When I saw this on VH1, I loved it. It had fun performances and was hosted by the always funny Ellen Degeneres. She was the host and opened the show with a warm-up with the dancers and a performance of Salt N' Peppa's Shoop, in the Britney Spears style with dancers and all. And then she went on with an even funnier monologue about how Cher flicked her off. How could you cut that??? It was hilarious. Even worse, they cut some performers altogether and some great songs as well. What were they thinking when they released this dvd? Why would any fan of the Divas Live series want this poor example of a commercially available dvd? I'll be looking for someone hawking an unedited bootleg and give them my money instead. Bad decision VH1!"
2,Great concert and singers but TERRIBLE production.,"It's a pitty that a concet such as this one didn't have a good video and cd production. The singers were great (Celine Dion, Anastacia, Cher, Dixie Chicks and Shakira).The first song it's the best one, the AC-DC cover ""You shook me all night long"" were you can see and hear two real divas (Celine and Anastacia). Cher also made a great work dressed as Elvis. In fact the live show was amazing but the edition on dvd and cd was terrible, the label left on a side several songs.I hope that one day they release the complete version because this one is shameful."
1,VH1 Divas Las Vegas 2002 DVD,"This show was amazing! The DVD..well...WASN'T! As you've probably seen in the other reviews, they cut the show up. I have to say that my favorite Diva moment was when they did the Elvis tribute finale. I was excited when I bought the DVD because I was going to be able to actually own the show with that moment. But they cut out Mary J. Blige's, Dixie Chicks', and Stevie Nicks's performances out!!!!! That really was upsetting. I also loved Cher and Cyndi Lauper's performance, but again-they cut that out, too. I'm really not sure if I should have bought the DVD or not...It was a real disappointment."
1,Save who's music???,"I thought this show was to SAVE THE MUSIC as was meant to be, but they forgot to SAVE SOME ARTISTS MUSIC by editing a little too much on this DVD, i feel ripp off. i saw the show on tv and couldnt wait to have the DVD to really enjoy a better quality of sound and picture, and here i was by the day it was released, just feeling angry after i played and watch the whole thing, wondering if my copy was defective,or probably i got a special rated version or who knows, after doing some searching i realized that that the way it was, and i've been waiting to see if they might release a DIVAS LAS VEGAS 2002 ""PART II"" or director cut edition, or extended version...whatever put the songs and artists back to the show,like CYNDI LAUPER and CHER duet, but as today, my guess is they are no gonna do it.My advice: DON'T BUY IT, just wait to see it on VH1 and record it, so you will have the whole show.Save the money and buy new CYNDI LAUPER standard's album ""AT LAST"" instead."
3,What a disappointment....,"Having seen this show when it came out on VH1 I was very upset at what they had cut out of it on the DVD and can't imagine why. There was a whole Elvis medley which if I'm not mistaken included Mary J. Blige doing Blue Suede Shoes and Stevie Nicks doing I forgot what other song. Don't get me wrong the performances on the DVD were great, but the show was incomplete. For that alone, I rate it what I did."
1,No Cyndi Lauper????,"How do these people expect to sell this dvd if they cut Cyndi Lauper's duet with Cher? I *WAS* going to buy it for Cyndi's brilliant appearance with Cher, but now? I don't want it even as a gift."
5,Good for Celine and Cher,"I really did not like this Divas Live because there were only two artists on it that I like and that's Celine Dion and Cher. I muted my TV when the rest of them came on. So it really doesn't bother me that they cut most all of the songs on this DVD. Just as long as Celine still gets to sing ""I'm Alive"" I'm happy."
2,"""Divas Las Vegas Event""","Honestly, it would have been very good but they deleted performances by Cyndi Lauper, Mary J. Blidge, & Whitney Houston. All the while I thought Vh1 Motto is to save the music but are they eating up their words of wisdom because this is one way or the other misleading the public. If the record company has something to do with it then at least Vh1 top caliber executives must be consistent in fighting and saving the music. You have mislead us already from Divas live 1&2 by deleting a lot of the divas performances. A piece of advice ""Fight for what you believe and save the music"". Please don't get me wrong all the stars are great but this dvd deserves ""2 stars only""."
1,Simply poor,"I expected more from this DVD. I watched Divas live! 2nd edition (the one with the red front), and this is really crap. Songs are great, okay, but it's extremly SHORT!! I bought this DVD on my trip to Argentina, hoping that when I came back to my home country I'll be excited to see it. I was wrong. 45 minutes for the price is just too unfair. Think twice if you want to buy this. I dont know why in the world they ever released it!I have to confess, though, that I bought it only because of Celine Dion."
1,Where's cyndi?,I gave this DVD 1 star because the section with Cyndi Lauper has been cut out. What a waste!
2,Would you pay full price just for the half?,"I can't really understand how the producer could remove more of the half of this great concert. I saw it on TV and was my number on priority buy for a dvd, but I got really dissapointed as soon as I saw it on the shelfs. There were many other singers that must have been on it, but not they just include less than 10 songs leaving out many other performances, like mary J with shakira, cher and cindy lauper etc... I wouldnt recommend to buy this dvd for this price, this is like a single dvd."
1,Is this how they're tryina' save the music??,"Think twice if you're gonna buy this Item, specially if you saw the show on TV and think this is gonna be it. I've seen it and it's so boring, not because the performers/performances are bad but because I was really expecting more, if you're a shakira, cher, or celine fan buy it. But if you're not you may wanna have some second thoughts about it."
1,WHAT How can they do this???,"Hi everyone this is a awful DVD. They cut out to many parts like Cher's duet with Cyndi Lauper, Mary J. Blidge's preformance, and much more. So everyone please think about the this idea about getting it because it is just not worth it I am telling you that you will waste your money please I am telling you for your own good. Besides if it is on T.V. tape it but I doubt it. And people if you are wondering the concert was 2 hrs. now it is about 1hr. Well bye everyone."
2,Blair review is correct,"I was lucky to watch the original broadcast on VH1. Then I waited a long time for the DVD release, I purchased it and was very disappointed of the editing. I would be very interested in purchasing this concert (I don't mind paying again for it) and other VH1 DIVAS concerts if they are released, at least, the way they were originally transmitted on TV.Blair comments are 100% accurate and fair."
2,Where is Cyndi?,"I bought this because Cyndi Lauper was supposed to appear on this.I was very disappointed firstly because Cyndi was not on it and secondly it was a very short dvd for the money.However a good dvd for fans of Celion Dion,Cher and Anastasia.Also Stevie Nicks performance was so short.Why cut out all the good stuff.Next divas please do not cut any of Cyndi Lauper,s performance."
3,Rip-off!!!!,My favorites of the night were the Dixie Chicks . They were so awesome. Why did you cut some of their songs off the dvd.It ruined the whole dvd for me. Actually the whole show was edited really horrible.
1,What the heck!,"I just saw the broadcast of this show over here in Singapore (like half a year later!) and I was pretty impressed and keen to get the DVD!BUT when i found out from the tracklist that they took out the the duet between Cher and Cyndi, Whitney and Mary, and EVEN the shoten terrific Elvis medley to ONLY 4, I was TOTALLY [cheesed] and disappointed!!!You dun expect me to get this! I would rather juz download the FULL, broadcasted show from somewhere in the net than to spend $$ on this!What's wrong with these people who make the decisions!!! Not only its poor marketing, it certainly dun help to beat the piracy!!! Good luck!!!"
4,VH1 Divas Las Vegas,everyone of the Divas did a great job with their songs - The reason why I purchased this was because I liked the songs they sang ( had the CD earlier) and wanted to watch them perform them.
3,Needs more location info & photos,"This is one of those books that most people probably don't read every page of. I know I didn't as a lot of the stories seemed uninteresting to me.I just want to point out that it annoys me to get a book like this, and then there is no address or location info provided so you are unable to find the places on your own. Some of the stories talk about a specific picture, and then they don't include the picture. Pretty pointless to include that story if you ask me. Its just a tease because now I want to see the photo.I did like how you could look in the back and find stories that went to specific states. Its surprising how many books don't do this. But overall there wasn't enough to capture my attention, as I said, I skipped a LOT. Glad I only got it from my library. I was through the book in a day."
3,Great Urban and Rural legends you may have heard of.,"Got this as gift, not sure I would have bought it on my own. Was a fun if not weird read. Some of the tales I had heard myself many years ago unfortunately they did not add much closure to what I already knew. Not for kids, I'll be keeping it away from my younger ones till they hit 12-13 or so. Still worth a look to relax and daydream a bit."
4,awaiting my grandson's review,"My grandson, O'Henry, age 9, has asks his mom for one of this series' books every time they go to a store. This will be his first. My family has deep roots in New England, so that would be a fun place to begin. I'm sure he will love the book. I'll find out after Christmas.I have always been happy with purchases from Amazon."
5,warcraft 3 night elf action figure,my son loves wow. this action figure is solid. it is impressive with all the detail work on it. a little expensive but if anyone you know loves to play world of warcraft this is the perfect gift for your gamer.
5,from MainlyPiano.com,"""Sunday Morning Favorites"" is a collection of traditional hymns played in a straightforward, classic ""country church"" style by Dr. David Leinweber, an Associate Professor of History at Oxford College of Emory University. Leinweber's playing style is both easy-going and dignified, and the songs are played from the heart without a lot of fanfare or flourishes. The seventeen tracks go back as far as 1772 (""There is a Fountain"") up through 1913 (""The Old Rugged Cross"" and ""In the Garden"" - my own ""Sunday Morning Favorite""), and include such staples as ""I Love to Tell the Story,"" ""Be Thou My Vision,"" ""He Leadeth Me,"" ""Sweet Hour of Prayer,"" and ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus."" Dedicated to Leinweber's late grandfather, also a pianist, ""Sunday Morning Favorites"" was obviously a labor of love and faith, and if you are looking for a really nice collection of solo piano hymns, I recommend this one."
5,Great Kid Version,"We read this book to our sons, 4 1/2 and 2 yrs. old, before taking them to the Nutcracker ballet. It is great version for introducing kids to the storyline. Nice illustrations and just enough text for young children."
3,Its fine,"The art of this book is a bit warped looking, almost disorienting, but it is a sweet read. My children and I like that it shows pictures of all the different ""Sweets"" dances, although the Sugar Plum Faery is very tropical looking in a black dress covered in many different flowers. I've had to get a couple of Nutcracker books to fill in the gaps."
5,Lovely Retelling of the Story,"My boy-girl twins have loved this book since they were 3. The story is easy to read and a very good retelling of the ballet. The illustrations in this book are lovely and colorful, my kids love the colors and the detail in the pictures. This book was very helpful when we went to see the ballet with the kids this year."
5,The Nutcracker Ballet,"There are several children's books about The Nutcracker, and I was amazed at how different the versions were. Before I took my four-year-old granddaughter to The Nutcracker ballet, we examined several of the books from the library. I bought this one for her because it is more true to the ballet than the others. At the performance, she was able to follow the scenes because this book had presented the story in sync with the ballet. The illustrations are lovely, and the text is not too short, not too long, but just right for reading to a child."
2,Not very illuminating,"We got this to show, and read to, our granddaughters before taking them to see their first Nutcracker. On-line reviews made it sound good, but we reacted very negatively to it when we previewed it before showing to the girls. We felt that the drawings were lame, potentially scary and didn't do a good job of illustrating the story/ballet. So we did not show it to the girls. We wound up downloading a synopsis and reading that text to them."
4,great portable gaming,"If you want to show your friend your progress on his Xbox, just bring the card to their house.A great way to keep your gaming portable, yet be careful what you save on it, it only has 8 megabytes on it."
3,Rough Start,"While I love the original movie, I'm not one of the extremely loyal Highlander fanboys (the Highlander-verse has always had a strongly loyal following), so i feel I can give an honest appraisal on this. The first half of Season One is downright awful- poor acting, weak scripts, and plot holes you could drive a broadswoard through. THings get better towards the end of the season, as some recurring characters and long-running plot threads begin to take root. Still, ther's not enough here to convince me to run out and get season 2. If you're curious about this show, I'd recommend getting this as cheaply as possible and struggle past the first few discs to get to the better stuff before rendering your verdict"
5,Best Possible Choice For A True Highlander Fan!,"The television broadcast was great. The VHS tapes were even better as they contained scenes edited for tv.The DVD's? Well, they are so crisp and clear and the sound so good, details missed the first five times are immediately found to be marveled over!There is nothing wrong with the tapes. They are what they are. The DVD's are just plain better IMHO.Even though I've watched an episode more times than I would care to admit, watching it on DVD makes the smile on my face just that much broader.Highlander is the reason I even 'have' a DVD player!"
1,Opening scenes have been deleted from the dvd!,"The opening scenes from almost all of the episodes have been omitted. These are the scenes that are crutial to the telling of each story. I do not, at this time, know if all sets are involved, or, if it is a quality control problem that occured when the episodes were transferred from tape to disk. Persons viewing these for the first time are going to be very confused and wonder why the series recieved such good reviews. Is my set a fluke or are all the new dvd sets flawed? Dissapointed in Nashville..."
1,not a good upgrade,"I love Highlander, but this season on blu ray will only play properly on a ps3. There are columns on the sides of the screen instead of the usual non distracting black bars used for a full screen display on a wide screen tv. The quality of the media is terrible. It is exactly the same as regular dvd. I will not be upgrading the rest of my collection. for highlander, dvd is just fine since blu ray didn't work out any better. In fact, I would prefer dvd because there are no distracting columns on the sides of the screen"
4,Great product with some packaging problems,"I ordered this from Amazon some time ago as a gift for my husband. I gave it to him a few months later, and it was a few months after that before he got around to watching it. He is a big fan of the show and he loved this set, but there was one problem: the box was missing a disc. I contacted Amazon - they were wonderful and shipped a new set ASAP. When we received the second set, it was missing a DIFFERENT disc! We ended up putting together a complete set using both of the incomplete ones and sending back what was left. (Big thanks to Amazon for their customer service - they were very apologetic and accomodating from start to finish.) Just be aware that if you are purchasing this product from a company with a strict time limit on returns/exchanges, make sure you open it right away and verify that you have all the discs!"
4,Adrian Paul comes out,"The first season starts off a little rough with Christopher L. carrying the shows. As the series goes on you can see that the writers, directors, and actors really hit their stride and each episode is better and better. The 'extras' really explain what was going on behind the scenes, such as why a major character like Darius was suddenly 'not there'.I really enjoyed this collection. The sound was great, the transfer was great, and for the price it was a great deal."
3,It gets better,"The first season of this show is very silly. They hadn't gotten the hang of story arcs or character development yet, but it's important to watch the first season so you know who everyone is. Also, the actor who plays Macleod actually studied sword throughout the series, so his swordplay gets less silly and more convincing/cool as you go along. Be patient with it!"
5,highlander season 1,i HAVEN'T WATCH ALL OF SEASON 1 YET BUT KNOW IT'S THERE AND CAN WATCH IT WHEN i WANT.WILL BUY ALL THE OTHER SEASONS WHEN i FINISH THE FIRST.I SAW ALL THE EPISODE WHEN IT WAS ON TV THE FIRST TIME AND LOVED IT THEN AS I DO NOW.Faye
5,Adrian Paul,Really like the Highlander series have watched all the episodes when they were on TV and want them to have on hand when I want to watch them and not wait for our cable company to decide to play something different.
3,"Excellent Series, Poor DVD Quality","I am a huge fan of the Highlander TV Series. Adrian Paul is excellent in a leading role. What I liked about the DVD set is the extras: commentaries, scripts, bloopers and behind the scenes stuff. What I didn't like about the DVD set is the poor DVD encoding quality. The first time I saw such poor encoding quality was in Warner Brothers - The Matrix DVD. I have just over 200 DVD's in my collection, many of the $5.99 variety, and none have as poor visual quality as the Highlander Series of DVD sets (all 3 so far). I'm sure Anchor Bay knew well that these DVD sets would sell to the fans of Highlander regardless of DVD quality. It's a shame they did this, and Adrian Paul and the other stars of the series should call Anchor Bay and complain."
5,Hardcore Highlander Fan,"I own all of the Highlander movies, as well as all of the Highlander: The Series 1-6. I don't think there was ever a better series on T.V. Not only is Adrian Paul fantastic to look at, the theme and messages were very well thought out. Since it appealed to a young(er) audience (& yes there was violence) but it taught overcoming adversity, fighting for what you believe in, and that doing the right thing is important (especially when you live forever) it spans all emotions: humor,love,sadness,tragedy and more, all of the things that make up LIFE. I highly recommend all of the series, start with the first and keep going til the end, it is better than any series on T.V. today."
2,A bit old for my tastes,"Well, these will help with the mandatory 20 words. This is an old series and the video quality is very poor. It is surprising that it lasted this long."
5,Duncan MacLeod,"Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. ""Same Clan different vintage."" Or so Connor says. The stories are action packed with tales of the brave highland warrior. Not Connor, but Duncan. Only thing better would have been to have Ramires some how involved in one of the episodes."
5,WOW!!!!!!!,"This video includes my two favorite all time BeeGees songs, Nights On Broadway and Ordinary Lives. They also have entertaining classics and 80s songs like You Win Again, Stayin' Alive, and How Deep Is Your Love. They include the funny sort of skit for Woman In Love and the funny controversy throughout Spicks And Specks. They do dedicate a song to Andy (How Deep Is Your Love) but is not as clever as Don't Throw It All Away Our Love in 1997. But for a 2 video collection of One songs, Saturday Night Live songs, and oldies songs of the BeeGees, this is worth buying at any cost!"
3,Compilation of various hits,"This compliation has all different types of music from variousdecades. You'll hear artists such as: Jo Stafford, Frankie Lymon &the Teenagers, Andy Williams, Buddy Knox, Sonny James, Jerry Lee Lewis, Everly Bros, Eddie Cochran, Del Shannon, Kingston Trio, Frankie Avalon, Animals, Manfred Mann, Herman's Hermits, Beach Boys,Tommy James & the Shondells, Blondie, Leo Sayer, Kim Carnes, Stars On 45, Culture Club, Duran Duran, and many, many more. 100 #1 Songs? I think they topped the European charts...many of which I never heard on the radio here. There's a lot of oldies but goodiesin this package."
3,"Good, but Small","The cup is only half full of macaroni. I figured once you added the water and cooked it, it would swell to fill the cup. But, no, prepared it was still only half full, and barely a snack, much less a meal. I doubt that even as a child this would have satisfied me. Good, but not worth a dollar a cup."
2,Good Enough for a Quick Snack,"This might not be the healthiest snack in the world, but for a quick, somewhat tasty bite Kraft microwave macaroni and cheese is decent enough.On the plus side it is extremely easy and quick to make, although frankly the small portions are really on for a small side dish or a quick snack.The one thing I do not like about it is the cheese seems really hard to blend into the pasta and sometimes it clumps up instead of spreading evenly, which can make for a rather interesting culinary experience.While I don't eat these often, if I am feeling lazy and want a quick bite, this works well enough for me."
1,got sick,I got sick from eating this that I was sweating cold sweats by my pained tummy. Will. Never. Eat. This. Again.
1,FIRE & SMOKE HAZARD,"For those of you concerned about the fire hazard with this product, the same thing happened to us this evening. The fire was almost immediate, and the smoke was pretty intense. The fire in the microwave continued to burn until it was doused, and now the whole house smells burnt, even after ventilating for hours. It looked like it could have burned out of control if someone weren't watching it close enough to see it flame up.My microwave is ruined. My house stinks of smoke. We probably avoided a disaster out of sheer luck.This product is not safe for use by children, or perhaps even adults."
3,"A Vital College Staple, Buuut . . . .","First of all I have to say, I LOVE these things . . . They come in handy when I'm too busy to go to lunch or if I ran out of meals (I'm a college student who lives on campus and; therefore, is subjected to the ""meal plans""). What makes them vital is the fact they are microwavable . . . . You don't have to boil water or any of that jazz . . .They're simple and easy, hence the name of the product - Easy Mac . . .Now for my complaints:1) The original flavor is boring . . . I prefer the Alfred or Triple Cheese kind . .2) The price isn't very good, buut it's a lot better than the prices of the Easy Mac sold at my school (my school overprices EVERYTHING . .. it sucks)3) They aren't very healthy . . .but I shouldn't except much healhiness from Mac N' Cheese4) Going back to complaint #1 . . .The taste itself is mediocre . .If you're looking for quality mac n' cheese this just isn't it . . ."
1,POTENTIAL FIRE WARNING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!! 0 STARS,"WARNING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT! I sent this email to KRAFT and ACME STORES where I purshased EASYMAC.I purchased your EASYMAC microwavable mac&cheese; dinner.The package was in the microwave oven for 2.5 minutes and the plasticcontainer melted and started to burn in the microwave.Had I not acted quickly my house may have burned down.This is very serious, and this possible fire causing problem should be madepublic."
3,Not fit for a princess,"I deserve better! But until my prince comes along and cooks something real for me, I'm stuck with these. Very easy, very OK to eat, very bad for you. OK, I love 'em, but I limit myself to one per day max. Otherwise how am I gonna catch that prince?"
2,Expensive for what you get,"As a lover of boxed mac and cheese, I thought that these would be the perfect thing for me, so I bought some--and subsequently pawned them off on unsuspecting neighbors. Okay, it wasn't that bad, but they are definitely not like homemade (though I wasn't suspecting that), nor were they even like boxed mac and cheese (which I thought they would do a good job of replicating). I felt that these cups taste very powdery and were unappetizing.The only way I could get them down was to mix some milk and butter with them. However, after already paying over $1 for this food, I feel like I shouldn't have to add more cents on to the price by supplying my own milk and butter. I also question the environmental friendliness of this food--there is an awful lot of extra waste made for a small amount of gain."
3,Excessive Salt,"I like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and hoped this would be a convenient and easy alternative to the box meal. It is relatively quick and easy to prepare, but it tastes excessively salty."
3,"Great watch, but beware...","This is a great watch! I've had it for a few years now. However, the little diamonds decals on the side are a problem. I lost the first one after six months! Two more of fell off soon after. It was a beautiful watch when I first purchased it, but I wish someone would have warned me about those little diamond decals falling off!"
2,not horrible,"I ordered this to use with a heat gun. My hope was that the long handle would give me good scraping leverage and less opportunity for injury. Well, I didn't get burned but the tool was extremely awkward to use. It is too heavy and seems weighted wrong. There are lots better scrapers out there."
3,Good Rhythm,"I won't rate it any higher because I know that people gets bored of these bandas too quick, but anyway I think that they have good styles and rhythms... too bad for them that they don't have many CDs around. Good Buy!"
5,.................Best Biography Ever,Ever want to get to know someone famous that you have haven't met? This is absolutely the best of the many biographies I have ever read. I feel like I know Billy Martin and understand where he was coming from with his sometimes erratic behavior. The George Steinbrenner relationship is very vividly explained and the impact of his personality on Martin's life. It is also some of the best writing you will ever see. Peter Golenbock has the ability to write whatever he wants to. You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this one. Mike Murphy
3,Five stars for historical details; One star for analysis,"Compard to David Faulkner's bio on Martin, this one by Golenbock has more insider details about Martin's life that make it the more interesting read. What does it in, unfortunately is Golenbock's peculiar analysis. Like so many people who like to ultimately elevate Billy the man higher than he deserves, more time is spent blaming George Steinbrenner for all of Billy's problems off the field. And it soon gets to the point where Golenbock actually performs what was once the impossible and makes you think he's too harsh on Steinbrenner. The bottom line is that Billy Martin, unlike his friend Mickey Mantle, never came to terms with what drinking and carousing could do to his life and for that, he had only himself to blame for not checking into the Betty Ford Clinic like Mantle did. Billy kept drinking not because of George Steinbrenner, but because of who he was, and that was a person with no morals whatsoever."
4,Enjoyable and sophisticated.,"""The Callender Papers"" is the third book I've read by Cynthia Voigt, and I was not disappointed. If you've read these types of stories before, then you could probably predict everything, but I admit to not figuring it out until more than halfway through the story. The writing is very sophisticated, and I as pleased that a young pre-teen girl was portrayed as someone who had a decent head on her shoulders. I would have liked a better explanation about Mr. Callender and the events that took place - I found that entire passage explained much too fast. Otherwise, this book is very enjoyable. I recommend."
2,wholly predictable,"A good mystery, any mystery worth its salt, must maintain a sense of suspense throughout. This mystery does not. A thirteen year old orphan is permitted by her aunt (her parents' origins are a mystery) to take a job helping to catalogue the ""Callender Papers"", the documents of her aunt's childhood friend. As she works, she uncovers a mystery involving the death of a character's wife and the disappearance of a child when it was young. It takes very little time to figure out that the protagonist is indeed this child. Unfortunately, she is not spunky enough a heroine to make her adventures intriguing, even when she is put in danger."
1,A Ridicullus Book. One of Voight's worst.,"The mystery is awful. The book is predictable and formulaic. And I couldn't care much for the stupid characters who insist on making stupid mistakes. Jean's head is full of air since she can't see anything strait, and can't figure out the secret before we do. Stay away from this awful book."
5,Best 've ever used,This was the first time that I used Nupercainal Dibucaine for my Hemorrhoids. I've used about everything out there. This has worked better then anything I have used
4,Fattburger-mmm good!,"Boy, is this fattburger album awesome! My roomate and I listen to it all of the time. It's ""fatt"" and funky. I gave it four stars because of the cover of ""oye como va"". It just wasn't smooth enough for me. This album just makes you want to sit down, relax, and hear the sounds of fatt coming through my stereo. Hot dog! This is the type of awesome stuff that makes me want to get funky.P.S.Love the album cover!"
5,at last!,"These cats put on a tremendously entertaining live show, and fortunately for us they've captured their wonderful musical hijinks in the studio. You can't say enough about how talented they are as musicians -- they're also connoisseurs of great songs (their own and others') and this album shows you how well they put their collective musical experience and soul together to come up with some honest-to-god, swingin', rockin', and twangin' American music.It can't be categorized, and you'll be glad of it -- the thinking musician's music is what it is. You'll play it over and over until you find yourself dancing with a wizened and devilish leprechaun to ""McHattie's Waltz"" in your dreams."
5,Great mix of music,The Waybacks are a Bay Area treasure I was lucky enough to come across on a trip there. Their talent is obvious in their range of music - from Irish-style ballads to American folk and beyond! Great driving music. Highly recommended.
3,RS 232 Cable,"Exactly as stated. Most all laptops will need a USB/RS-232 adapter, and driver in order to use this.Will probably require some computer knowledge.I cannot understand why the telescope manufacturing companies seem to stay about 10 years behind the current technology?"
2,need a Serial to USB adapter,"Yeah, these cables were created some years back and they need a mated serial to USB adapter added. I've used this config to plug it into a USB port and control my Celestron Nexstar using DeepSky and this cable. Also need to download the ASCOM files and free ASCOM Celestron driver."
2,Cable to Old for Actual Use,I bought my Sister a Celestron Telescope and a good assortment of accessories for her birthday. I bought this celestron pc cable thinking that it would connect to the laptop we got her for christmas. WRONG it doesnt connect without buying an adapter because the rs232 ports are ancient in the computer world. Still the product was as described as far as condition goes.
4,You need this!,"If you want to use your computer to point your telescope. It doesn't come with the scope, not ours anyway. Also be aware that if you don't have the proper port on your laptop you'll have to get a USB adapter and assign the USB port to act as a serial port."
4,Warning: The first 3 discs.,"Warning: The first three discs are IDENTICAL to the America's Great Road Trips, and Scenic Drives discs (I don't mind because I always want a good backup) minus the Road Trips discs. I don't regret getting America's Most Senic Drives (even though they are repeats on the first 3 disks) as the bonus disk of America The Beautiful makes it worth while(which is real good, but has nothing to do with the popular attraction at Disneyland). I may not regret it, but you might."
4,Scenic drives,"Scenic drives,....with this on the big screen it makes me feel like i am on one of my own trips. One year i took a trip i dubbed the national and state park vacation. Because of my love for our national parks and scenic byways i bought this DVD. And last year i went to 40 state and local parks, 10 National parks, saw three Zoo's and visited over 40 lighthouses. Great DVD!!"
3,good price for a travel video but....,"this is a real bargain for a travel video but like the other reviewers has said, the red car in this video is annoying. most probably the ford motor companysponsored this video to show off their taurus car. another problem is that each place was only given like 5 minutes of viewing which i think is not enough plusit only showed the scenic spots and did not emphasize the people and its culture in each place. reader's digest which is known for good writing did not doa good job here."
2,America's Most Scenic Drives,"It's a just an OK DVD. They gave you the route number of the road taken. Then they showed the animated route being drawn on map that is missing all other roads. It is more about destinations to see in the USA than the roads it takes to get to them. Get the Readers Digest Most Scenic Drives in America Book, National Geographic Guides to Scenic Highways or the Back Roads of New England or whatever destination IN BOOK. I bought it looking for some new roads to ride my motorcycle on. No one has produced a good compilation of great roads....Rick Seebak and Lincoln Highway is the best I've seen, but its just one highway."
2,Not as good as expected.,"Narration put me to sleep, too cliche. DVD wasn't quite what I expected. Some good video work but too much off highway photography. I was expecting more scenery as seen from the highway."
1,don't waste your money...,"You actually see more of the little red car (a Ford...did Ford sponsor the original tv broadcast, I wonder?) than you do anything that I'd call ""scenery""...lots of parades and roadside trashy touristy stuff - and the film crew has an inexplicable fascination with traffic lights in the downtown areas of small towns...I have no idea what that's about, but very little it the way of scenery. For instance, if the sequence in disk 1 about Mount Desert Island in Maine was all you had to go on, you wouldn't think the place was worth visiting, much less one of the most beautiful places in the entire country which it is. You'd have a really good idea of what that stupid red car looked like though!I'm shocked that Reader's Digest let its name be attached to something this cheesy...stay away!"
1,Waste of money,The picture quality is terrible. Looks like it was transferred from VHS or some older technology. I'll stay away from Reader's Digest videos from now on.
4,Explains How to Draw Cats by Observing Them,"The format of this book is so handy -- small & spiral bound so it remains open while working. I would have preferred the text to be larger, but then maybe I just need glasses.The author has done a great job of mixing interesting cat facts and fun along with detailed instructions about how to draw cats. Confusing things like proportion and distance of the eyes to nose, different shapes of heads and ears, are given new meaning that makes illustrating cats much easier.These are not static ""draw what you see in this book"" type of lessons. This author encourages you to look at your own cat while he sits, sleeps or does any of those cute cat things right in front of you, and draw with confidence."
2,This book doesn't work for me,"This book doesn't work for me at all. I expected more but I can't find what I need in the book. Sorry about this review. If you want to learn animal drawing, The Art of Animal Drawing by Ken Hultgren is a better one."
1,meow mix,"I was very disappointed with this book. it is full of great sketches but not any applicable drawing instruction. I was hoping for not only examples but ""how to"" guidance and this book doesn't offer it. The title of the book is very misleading, its really about looking at all the poses and features that cats share not about drawing them. Will seek out another author who teaches how to draw cats..."
2,Lacking enthusiasm,"Reminiscent of essays written by bored school children, The Planets by Sobel is lacking in enthusiasm and excitement for its subject matter. The boring regurgitation of fact bogs down what might otherwise be an novel approach to astronomy integrating myth and science. I highly recommend this book to those who have trouble sleeping at night, otherwise find an author who brings the wonders of the planets to life."
1,Not For Me,"This book is not for me.I can't get past the pompous style. It reads like W C Fields except that it's not funny.Try this totally representative sentence from the chapter on Venus:""These collisions eject copious debris, yet all the rubble hugs close around the crater margins in neat festoons, as though contained there by the heavy air.""Festoons? Is this a joke? I can't help reading it in a W C Fields voice.For the chapter on Uranus and Neptune the author ""assumed Maria Mitchell wrote of her 1847 find to ... Caroline Herschel.(1750 - 1848)."" I can hardly tell the difference between the 19th century style and the rest of the book.The chapter on Mars written from the point of view of a Martian rock doesn't work for me.- - -I like the book ""Understanding the Planetary Myths"" by Lisa Tenzin-Dolma ISBN 0-572-03032-0"
3,Slick Trick,"When I first picked up this book I was awed by its beautiful presentation. The quality of the printing is outstanding, with a coordinated slip cover and bindings, and some really wonderful illustrations. Sadly, the contents did not live up to expectation. The more I read, the more I got the feeling that this book contains all the leftovers from her two previous books, Galileo's Daughter and Longitude, that didn't fit in but which she was loathe to discard. It's a neat little conjuring trick, but it hasn't really come off. It leaves the reader with a sense of dissatisfaction, because it lacks coherence. It's all form and no substance."
4,A Nice Introduction to Astronomy and Astrophysics,"Ms. Sobel has written an excellent primer for those of us interested in the Solar System but who are not scientifically inclined. Her book starts with a breif history of the solar system and then takes the history, mythology, and current knowledge about each planet in turn all the way out to the planetoids of the Kuiper Belt.Her writing style is not too technical and is easy enough for even your average Jr. High student to understand. She puts everything in layman's terms so you do not need to be Stephen Hawking to enjoy the book.My only regret is that there are no pictures."
2,"Okay, not fabuous","I find it a little odd that several people have expressed disappointment that the ""letter"" from Caroline Herschel to Maria Mitchell about the discoveries of Uranus and Neptune in the chapter ""Night Airs"" was the author's creation. Sobel uses this letter as a means of conveying the info in an interesting manner, much as she communicates from the point of view of the Martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001 a few chapters earlier. Perhaps these same people will be disappointed to learn that the meteorite didn't actually ""speak"" the words attributed to it in that chapter?I found this to be a quick read, and I had read the entire book cover to cover in about two hours. It's really written at about a sixth-grade level. It might be a good read, especially if you're unfamiliar with astronomy or need a quick refresher. However, in this reader's opinion, Sobel's other two books ""Galileo's Daughter"" and ""Longitude"" are much better."
4,Planets,"I love anything Dave Sobel writes! This understandably does not have as much personal insight as Longitude but she has the gift of making a topic she cares about personal, informative, captivating, and enjoyable. What's next?Bob hislop"
3,It's a Pleasant Little Book and Story,"This book, so much more than any I've read in a while, seems more like an extended term paper than a book. With the success of her book, Galileo's Daughter (which I will also review), someone wanted her to produce something fast. The book is fine and the anecdotes are interesting, but the book should really be marketed as 'Young Adult'.More than anything, what makes it look like a term paper (that had a minimum page size, but not words) are the large margins, the font size of the print, the line spacing and the number of blank pages and drawings, which all seem to be added so as to make it look like an actual book. This could better be printed as a pamphlet, and given out at your friendly neighborhood Planetarium."
1,nope,"Got this book as a gift and i'm glad I didn't pay for it. Was expecting some casual reading on the planets as opposed to the usual textbooks I dig through. After awhile I suspected it was a gag-gift and i'd been given an evangelist homeschooler's science text.A few quotes-""Totality provides the only safe time to gaze at the omnipotent Sun without fear of requital in blindness..."" (what? what? & seriously?).""Is it an accident that the Solar System's lone inhabited planet possesses the only satellite precisely sized to create the spectacle of a total solar eclipse? Or is this the startling manifestation of the Sun's hidden splendor part of a divine design?"" (messing up birds in a sliver of area every once and awhile is just god saying ""I love you"")I stopped reading because the eye rolling was straining my sockets."
3,"A dance of data, fantasy, poetry, snippets of memoir.","In Dava Sobel's `The Planets,' a large serving of interesting data about our neighboring solar orbiters is mixed with a modest measure of history and more generously with poetic whimsy. This was the third of Sobel's books that I've read, and although it maintained my interest, overall it was rather unspectacular; too given to digression, perhaps too `arty' for a book on planetary astrophysics / geophysics. The factoids are here, there is science here, but this is not science writing (well, here and there it is). This is diverse prose, including memoir, that spins along Sobel's trajectories [all whilst orbiting the planets].In this reader's experience, the best of Sobel's books is `Galileo's Daughter.'"
4,LUSCIOUS AND LYRICAL,"Dava Sobel is quite a remarkable pioneer.Her runaway bestseller LONGITUDE spawned 101 imitations (the latest of which, HALLEY'S QUEST, may actually be closest to her early character-driven style). Her GALILEO'S DAUGHTER revived the art of epistolary narrative, with the author translating many Renaissance letters for the first time in English.And now PLANETS seeks to expand our worldly perspective with a trek to each of the gems in our solar system. To do this Ms. Sobel takes an unusual step for a science writer and uses some fictitious devices and personal meditations. They certainly distinguish her chapters from an overwhelming mass of existing hard science material. A few factoids are off, the astrology becomes a tad eccentric for my taste, but we are willing to forgive such a beguiling travel companion.In sum, this is a buffet from an unusually talented chef. You need not swoon over each and every plate to enjoy a sumptuous and memorable meal."
2,Disappointing,"Although Ms. Sobel has a great ability to write, this particular work was disappointing in that although the theme of explaining and introducing the lay reader to the solar system has it merits, she fails to really keep you interested. The book is not very long and I really had a hard time finishing it after getting to the middle. It is a decent overview of the planets, but I could have been more interested in the subject by just doing a wikipedia search."
4,Interesting book.,"I am a fan of the author and have found this book to be very interesting, although not the best from Dava Sobel."
3,the planets,"The book was probably directed to those with casual interest. Several pages were devoted to extraneous subjects, probably for filler. I have read many books on the planets in research for my book, ""Sonnets for the Planets"". Sobel's book did not offer an in-depth study of the planets. I am glad it did not cost as much as many new books do."
1,Best avoided,"Not having read Dava Sobel's other books, I can't comment on her skill as a writer, but this book is a disappointment. More concerned with flowery language than getting the facts straight, I read the first half of the book, then began flipping through the rest, finding myself increasingly irritated by the writing style and 'fluffy' thinking. The constant biblical references were extremely tiresome for a book supposedly dealing with facts.Spend your money on any book by Carl Sagan, and avoid this one."
2,Basic.,"Really basic information, which most people will already know. I was disappointed. Appropriate for high schoolers and middle schoolers."
2,Not a guide to the Planets,"Dava Sobel has written some excellent books about science. This is not one of them. I got this as a quick review of the science of Planetology; it is a very strangly written account of the history of Planetology. Ms Sobel adopts an oddly florid style throughout which makes it very difficult to understand. In two cases she uses a first person voice; once as the the meteor which is believed to be from Mars and once as the sister of William Herschel. In both cases it is so strange that it is difficult to follow. In the narrative about Jupiter she spends as much time going on about astrology as astronomy. I have no idea if Ms Sobel is serious about Astrology (I hope not) but as an experienced science writer she should be aware that it has no legitimate place here.There are other, less confusing accounts of the planets. Buy them and avoid this."
2,Undecided,"Initially I was thrilled by 'The Planets' I thought Ms Sobel's style of writing interesting and demonstrative of her love of the subject matter. However the constant biblical references at first surprised and then grated and although the book does have a few awe-inspiring, soundbite-esque facts I felt that it failed to show the real magnificence of the solar system and the physics behind of it."
5,"Dava Sobel's ""The Planets"" is Utterly Captivating!","This is the first of Dava Sobel's books that I have read and it is utterly captivating! She takes the blind on a sighted tour of an unknown world, making it visible and real. Infusing it with color, grace, heat, cold, texture, she simultaneously composes a score of poetry, music, and light. Drawing from science and history, she cleverly choreographs a symphony brought to light from outer space. Whether you have ever or never wondered about the planets, you will drink them in through Sobel's beautiful writing."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I read this book looking to find insight into the most up-to-date info on the solar system, hoping to learn more beyond my layperson knowledge. Instead of a generalized grand tour or a data-rich analysis, I made my way through a highly stylized, poetic ode to the celestial bodies, with a smattering of mythology, popular culture, and some scientific history.I have to admit that the book was well-done, extremely well-written, and it's obvious that Sobel knows her stuff. But I just wasn't that interested. I enjoyed some of the facts she did provide, but I waited in vain for more. I wanted to spend more time with each world, and to read a summary of all the best opinions about the planets.All in all, I would recommend this book if you want a literary take on the subject. On the other hand, if you're more like me, I would avoid it."
3,"Close, but not the same.","A good price, but the product they sent me was not what you see here. It was a generic version without the printed numbers and grip on the sides."
5,Preaching With Spiritual Passion,"This small book is one of my library treasures. There are times when I feel spiritually dry and need reminded of where to seek ""Living Waters."" At least twice a year I turn to this book to renew the fire in my belly for preaching God's Word. Somehow, I simply relate to the author and find reassurance in knowing that I am not alone on this sometimes lonely pathway."
3,What happened here?,"I admit it. I was one of the people to absolutely obsess about this game before it came out. I bought every magazine with new info on this game. Then when I recieved it at Christmas, I was disappointed. Do you like scavenger hunts? Do you like playing a level 5 times? If ""Yes"", by all means buy it! But if you are looking for something with a little more meat, buy Perfect Dark. If that's too mature for you, I suggest Banjo- Tooie. All I'm asking you to do is to think hard before buying this. This is not anywhere as good as SNES Donkey Kong Country."
3,"Great game, but a bit long...","This game intrigued me as I have always been a huge fan of the SNES versions so long ago. However, this game, while being a blast and a half, was very long. It was difficult to finish because the mini-games are frustrating and the levels grow to be a bit monotonous about halfway through the game. It will definitely keep you playing for hours though. Overall, Donkey Kong 64 is a very fun game. Okay, 'nuff said."
5,HE'S BACK!,"D.K 64 IS DEFINITELEY ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED! IT'S FUN , EXITING AND PROVIDES A PUZZLE FOR EVERYTHING!AN EXELLENT GAME"
3,This game's ok,It's fun when you first start playing but the more you play the more boring it gets! But it is also very challenging.
3,Deja vu?,"All said and done, this is a good game. Thanks to the Expansion Pak, the graphics and sound are excellent. There is tons to explore, and there are many puzzles and challenges. However, I did not give this game five stars because I kept feeling like I'd seen it all before.The storyline is certainly familiar; Donkey Kong Country's villain K. Rool and his horde of Kremlings have taken over DK isle and it's your task to use Donkey Kong and his four Kong pals to defeat him.Secondly, the game bears more than just a resemblance to Banjo-Kazooie. The physics of some moves are similar (e.g. Kazooie walking up hills and Lanky walking up hills; laying eggs and throwing oranges; backflip animation is nearly identical.) The music in certain areas is also similar.If you're a fan of Donkey Kong or Banjo-Kazooie, or just want to see the graphics, I recommend this game."
4,Great game,This is a very long hard and complicated game. Its a good addition to any game library. It is a lot like Banjo Kazoii though.
1,fun for the half hour i played,"I borrowed this game from a friend. I played for half an hour then got bored. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it. It's pretty much just Banjo-Kazooie(which I also didn't like). I was upset, especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas. Why couldn't they have just put out another Banjo-Kazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N64.Banjo-Kazooie was fun, until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere. Also, the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it.I didn't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this, but it looks like it didn't. It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands. Great.If you liked Banjo-Kazooie, I'm sure you'll love this. If not, definitely skip Donkey Kong."
1,Not worth buying,"this game was a major dissapointment. I play video games and i'm pretty good but this game was way too hard. do not get this game for younger kids they will get bored because they'll get stuck in the first couple of minutes. In the game you are supposed to find all of the Kong Klan(DK's relatives)so u can switch off to different characters instead of being DK all the time. that is a good idea but only excellerated video gamers would be able to get them. the first day my family got it, me and my siblings only played for a couple hours at the most. DO NOT get this for younger kids, i am 15 and couldn't figure it out and i have a ton of video games. This game is a rip-off and very confusing. Now the long awaited DK 64 is on the shelf collecting dust."
2,Sad for being Donkey Kong,I thought this game was going to be fun. I gave it 2 stars because the graphics where ok but it is hard to know where you are going. This game is confusing. Maybe it is for 12 year olds because my little sister could play it better than me. MARIO RULES!
5,DK 64!,I bought this game when it first came out and all I can say is WOW! I love it. I admit it was hard to fuinally get started but after that i just could not stop. It is even better when you have all of the cahracters in your collection. I have spent day after day trying to beat it but i can't. I get farther and farther but I can's. That is what I like in games. How tough they are. I also found this game to have a great lasting appeal. I would give this game a 4.5 out of 5 but since there is no .5s i rounded it up to 5. i would recomend this game to anyone that likes these type of games like Mario and the old DK. Thanks for your time
5,Pure Genius,"I want to thank the folks at Rareware for creating such an astoundingly funny, clever, gigantic, beautiful game. The music is the best game music ever written, in my opinion, and it gives the game wonderful atmosphere. The graphics are incredible, the jokes are side-splittingly funny, the areas are detailed and memorable, and the puzzles and games are original and engaging. The final battle was a surprise worth waiting for. I spent a week living in a world I'll never forget. There's no way to describe it - you just have to experience it.One word of caution: play it with a friend. The people I know who played it with someone else (taking turns at the controls) enjoyed it much more than those who played it alone."
3,"Lots of stuff, but poor overall game design.","This is not a five-star game, and it's far worse than Super Mario 64. The camera tracking and hint system are both badly programmed. But its major flaw is the overall game design. Rare came up with a truckload of games and ideas, and then just put arbitrary decisions into the overall game to string them together. There are tons of things to do, but if you don't beat the level bosses, you can't progress. Rare should have designed all the mini games and boss levels so that choosing another Kong character, or returning later on with more experience, would make the game easier. They failed. The hours you put into this game *let* you go further, but don't *help* you go further.There's a lot to like, and after a few hours climbing the learning curve you'll have twenty-plus hours of fun wandering around. But completing the game is an exercise in frustration, even with a game FAQ at hand."
5,Great Adventure Game!,"Donkey Kong is one of the best adventure games on N64. As the game proceeds you unlock different kongs. My favorite is Tiny!! The levels and areas are complete and fully developed. It's not one of those games where you can finish it in a day, it takes months and months. I haven't even completed it! I think this is a great game for kids and teens, they'll enjoy long hours of fun and enjoyment. The graphics are very good too. I highly recomend it..!!"
1,This game is too difficult.,"I bought DK64 when it first came out in 1999, and from the moment I started to play it I did not like it at all. It is way too complicated and difficult to play, and I would not recommend this game. Every time I tried to play it I just kept getting frustrated, and I had to stop playing it. Instead I would recommend Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64."
1,YOU NEED AN EXPANSION PAK,"Just a word to any of you ordering this game. We don't know how fun it is yet, because it requires an Expansion Pak...which we do not have. We didn't know this when ordering."
1,Way too hard,I'm a huge DK fan. Only reason I got N64 was to play more DK. This game is way too hard. All you do is search and search and search some more. If you ever do accomplish anything there is little or no reward. It is boring and frustrating at the same time. I'm very disappointed.
2,Donkey kong is the ultimate king?,I this game was about kind of the oringnel donkey kong but Mario throws the barrels but it is not. It is about aligators introoding Donkey kong island and takes your friends. I thought Mario was. Level 1 is hard beacause your suposed to free a monstser. At the beginng theres a song playing it lasts 5 freaking minutes and in the song theres a h word. Dude people play this game and little kids too so why the h word! Do not get this game but I am lucky beacause I bought it for 8 bucks not 154 dolars! That is ridiculus price for a nintendo 64 game!
1,Stick with Super Nintendo DK,This Donkey Kong 64 pales in comparison with the other Donkey Kongs for Super Nintendo. Save your money.
1,OH WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT,"This game is the biggest waste of time ever. Imagine a game where you have no purpose except to do the same thing, over and over again, with different characters, for literally DAYS of playing time. Great graphics and lovely music doesnt make up for the most shallow game play on the N64 since that weird chameleon game."
4,RARES BEST GAME YET!,"I GOT THIS GAME FOR CHRISTMAS,AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS,IT'S WONDERFUL,THE GRAPHICS ARE STUNNING AND THE TUNES ARE WONDERFULLY ORIGNAL,THIS IS THE BEST RARE GAME YET,I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET IT, HOWEVER I HAVE ONE COMPLAINT ,THAT IS I THOUGHT THIS GAME COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT MORE DIFFICULT BUT ONLY IN CERTAIN PLACES......."
5,Dk mania,This game gets me all excited when I play Monkey Smash in Kong battle. It is a lot of fun. This is the best game in the universe. I just go crazy with the theme song and I like to sing it. The first boss that I fought was very challeging. I had to fight him five times.
4,This is a great game.,"Overall this is a great game. The graphics are not all that good since they made the gamecube the graphics are way better. They are still good though. It is fun once you get used to it.The controls don't work as smoothly as the gamecube, but the do the job. Overall it is a fun game. They just need to inprove graphics and controls."
2,Deja Vu...?,"When I sat down to play this game I got a strange feeling... some people call it ""deja vu."" I HAD PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE! It suddenly hit me that this game was pretty much BANJO KAZOOIE! Hello?! Am I the only game critic in the world to notice this? Sure, it's got some differences. The whole ""play the game 5 times so that you can beat it with ALL the kongs"" is different, but come on! Who wants to play the game that much anyway? This game became pretty frustrating at times and I grew to hate it. If you liked Banjo Kazooie, you may end up liking Donkey Kong 64... and well, if you are a Donkey Kong fan, definately check this game out... but if you aren't, you really should stay away from this game!"
5,He's back--- BIGGER! BETTER! AND STRONGER!,"donkey kong 64 is the best game I have ever played.I have hade 2 hole years of Nintendo 64, and is the BEST GAME EVER! If you liked Zelda,mario,star fox,or Banjo kazooie,donkey kong 64 is all of them put together."
1,BORING,"I love platformers of all kinds, but this game is horrible! The game is extremely boring to start with but it gets even worse when you have to do the same thing FIVE TIMES OVER! Worst of all it's confusing as to what is even happening and annoying trying to do anything once you know. About the only thing good is the graphics. Shame they're wasted on a horrible game. This ruined the DK series. Get Banjo-Kazooie or Tooie."
1,The SNES versions were way better,"I wish they would make a Gamecube side-scrolling Donkey Kong effort like the SNES games, just make the graphics better, retain the music quality and make more levels and longer. They included some lovely old games like the original DONKEY KONG arcade game, and a spaceman game for computer. There are big worlds, but that seems just about it. There's a lot of collecting, but the problem-solving is no fun. This series became really removed from it's huge SNES appeal."
1,dissapointing,"This game is close to terrible, i as a teeanager, and gamer am quite dissapointed at the quality of the game. It lacks all the magic (and music) of the original SNES classic. It is way to long for the amount of interest it awakens in the gamer. By the time I collected my first banna i thought it was mediocre, but when i found out i had to collect about 200 bannanas i just quit. Also, it's to restricted; for example: You can use the rhino, but only during 5 seconds of the game, what's that all about? And you can't use any other animals. Besides, the cart scene is terrible when made 3D. I only recomend this game (and that is slightly) to the people who haven't played the SNES version, maybe they can see something good in it, but if you've played the last version and then play this you'll compare both and then you'll realize that this game [is awful]!"
1,"As usual, great,...until the ending.","I really don't want to sound like I am whining, but this company has done it again. Just like in Banjo-kazooie, and golden-eye, they have substituted a hard ""puzzle"" with stict if you don't hit the button in .25 seconds or less, then you must spend the next 4 hours trying to win the game. All in all, all three of those games are great, butthe ending are ALL let downs. Instead of an ending that does test skill, they just test luck. What fun is that? I am always left with a bad taste in my mouth after beating these games. They spoil the entire ""build-up"" with a terrible ending. I guess they think they are being crafty, I think they are just lazy. Maybe they need to take some pointers from the people that developed Zelda."
4,Not Quite as Good as Super Mario 64!,Though this game plays a lot like Super Mario 64 it is not quite as good. That is because everything you do a each level you have to repeat as a different character so it gets too redundant. It was a lot easier to beat than Mario 64 as some of those stars are very difficult to get. There are very few in this game that are very difficult.
3,"After you beat the game, it gets boring!","This is an ok game but after you beat it, its boring! I recommend A different game."
4,the game is here(sort of),There was a lot of hype to this game.( which got me hooked) There is alot of stuff to do in this game and it is hard to get evry thing done. I found just to get to the boss of this game was easy but finding all the bannanas and stuff was hard. When I bought this game I thought it would be as good as zelda:Ocarina of Time but it was not. The graphics were great! It is bigger than Zelda.I like that you get to play the origenal DK and Jetpack which you need to to beat the game and it is fun.
5,Very Pleasing,This is the best game rare has ever made! The graphics are unbelievable and the play control is outstanding. This game will take a long time to beat! This ones a hit!
3,Pretty good,"This game is a very interesting game to say the least! It's kinda like Super Mario but with bananas and not stars. So why the 3 stars well it's just got too much going on. Banana faires, and gold medals, crowns, keys, portals, musical instruments and multi- colored bananas. I just miss the old snes Donkey Kong I guess. Where the game started out at the beginning and you fought your way to the end of the level (marked with the sign ""the end"") and you moved on to another level and so on. I have turned into Cranky I guess (inside joke if you own the game)"
3,Need more action!!,I believe the game should me more set up like Donkey Kong of Super Nintendo than confusing players!
4,Very Cool!,"This game is awesome! It has everything, including a four player multiplayer with four different of stages and types of games. Plus, I haven't even mentioned the single player. Fungi forest and crystal caves are really cool levels and Lanky rocks! The story isn't good though. All you're really doing is saving DK's tiny home, one of Cranky's numerous huts, some golden bananas that they'll eat anyway, and some gnawty beavers."
3,Extremely average.,"I never did like this game. The graphics and the lighting effects are spectacular for the N64, and this is why the game is getting the 3 stars I gave it. This was a very frustrating, monotonous, and overall uninteresting platform game. Super Mario 64 was a lot better than this mess Rare put out. Take Care of yaselves"
5,amazing,"there's so much to do in this game, that it will have you playing for hours! one of the best games ever made... period."
4,Donkey Kong 64,"Donkey Kong 64 is one of the best games created on Nintendo 64. It is like Mario 64 + BanjoKazooie put together but a lot easier. It is challenger but not enough to make you want to stop playing. The only downside is that you have to keep changing characters to get all the golden bananas on each level. Also Tiny Kong becomes very, very, very annoying because she makes indescribable sounds."
2,Boooooooring!!!!!,"this game is ridiculous. somehow, it is hard but boring. it's impossible to have fun or get addicted to it, like you can in other great games. this makes it extremely boring. in the beginning, the game doesn't state where you are even supposed to go to get to ""the action."" when you do get to ""the action,"" it's is too hard. I of course shouldn't say that because I've never been too good at the game, but still, this is my opinion. The ""action"" (if you could call it that) is flying over lava pools or getting to a certain ledge- none of the classic, very fun, jumping on enemies and timing it right to blast yourself out of a barrel onto safe land. the gameplay is horrible. this new corrupted version of the great classic game makes it extremely boring. The only good thing is you get more characters than in the old games, with different special abilities. (...)"
3,Game required expansion pack to work,They don't tell you up front the game requires an expansion pack just to work. This forced me into investing even more into my old N64 system. The kids did enjoy the game for about 1 week but then returned to Mario Kart.
4,Alright,"Whene I got this game i thought it whas going to be great,but as i got further,it got more boring.Still i'm more into Sports{games and real sports}so it didn't work out the way I thought.Still this game is good and if you like dk,buy this"
3,DONKEY KONG IS THE BOMB,Diddy Kong is my favorite character.He is so full of spunk.I like this game because it is challenging.I think it is interesting that there are different colored bananas.
3,Cool DK Game...AARRGGHH!,"This game has cool graphics and sound effects. I liked the sniper scope and homing ammo. Lanky Kong is my favorite Kong; he looks weird. I liked Lanky's handstand the best. I didn't actually think that the game was that great. I hated some of the mini-games, and I did not like the 1980's Donkey Kong Arcade. The golden bananas aren't really that easy to get, and I did not like Diddy's jetpack. Sound effects and play control is very good. I like the beginning rap and the ending. The game takes a lot of patience and time to play through."
3,"It's very fun, but it isn't really a DK game in nature...","If this game was more like the Donkey Kong Country series released on the SNES, then it would be a masterpiece. It's true that it has several of the DKC basics, including several monsters, massive bosses, the Kong Family-Donkey, Diddy, Candy, Funky, Cranky, and Wrinkly, as well as newly introduced members Chunky (Kiddy's brother), Tiny (Dixie's sister), and Lanky (DK's second cousin). However, the game is really more like Banjo-Kazooie, which is unquestionably Nintendo and Rare's trademark N64 series. Rather than having various levels in multiple worlds to trek through in a platform adventure, we get eight massive worlds for heavy exploration. It really just isn't quite the same. As true as it is that it is fun as hell to play, it doesn't get as high an overall rating because it strays so far from the classics. However, other than that, it is highly enjoyable."
1,Yeah,"As you probably know, Nintendo depends on their Mario, Luigi, Yoshi and all the other stupid characters. Those are the only N64 and Gamecube platformers. Nintendo people are obviously on drugs when they make video games. Here's a monkey. Oh, let's say some weird little thing steals this other monkey! Oh , yeah. That's how the game was created.Nintendo games are creative, but sometimes overly so. In Yoshi's Story, play a few minutes and you'll obviously know that it was marketed to 5-year-olds. Now to the game, it's DUMB. There's not one aspect of it that's fun. You run around being some fat blob of monkey trying to get ""Golden Bananas"" that are a obvious ripoff of Banjo-Kazooie and Tooie. Just signals they're out of ideas. This has gotten rave reviews from just about anybody that has played it and I have no friggin idea why. It's just dumb and so is Nintendo. Nintendo Revolution? *rolls eyes* It will revolutionize bad gaming.LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY"
2,"Too little, too late","Just a bigger Banjo Kazooie. Why is it that Nintendo releases a game system and then has so little respect for its customers that it releases only 1 major Mario game (not counting Mario Kart or anything like that, we're talkin real games here), only 1 Zelda game, and so little of anything else (No Metroid, No Kid Icarus, etc.) and then designs an all new system that they expect customers to buy? I for one am tired of it. This is a cute game, a fun game, but not considerably more fun than a game like Pac Man World on the Playstation or any of the dozens of other titles that appear on the Playstation while Nintendo SLOOOWLY releases expensive carts, and nowhere near as great as Mario64 was. The next time Nintendo releases a game system, I'll wait until theres a few games to buy rather than have to endure two or three years worth of good games ONLY during Xmas season."
4,Hours of fun...,"As a 32 yr old that played all the games in the 80's, all I cansay is kids today are lucky. I've already spent hours fooling aroundwith this game. It doesn't require the same type of hand-eye coordination that ""our"" games required, but it's a lot more fun.The only irritation is it's slow to get started. I got a little ...[upset], wandering around like an idiot, trying to find some bananas.But once you get rolling, it's really a lot of fun. END"
3,Not for DK fans,"This is different from the previous DK titles, in which fast thinking and good reflexes were needed. Sure, there are a couple of roller coasters here, but this is basically the ""look for items and open the doors"" type of game. If you are going to buy this, better expend your money on RayMan 2."
2,What A Waste Of Money!,"I am a long-time fan of donkey kong. I loved the Super Nintendo games of Donkey Kong and when I saw the previews on TV for Donkey Kong-64, I figured the game would be great...BOY WAS I WRONG! I noticed 1 thing about every game from Nintendo 64 that is not a sports game. THEY ARE ALL THE SAME! Play Mario-64, then Banjo-Kazooi...notice something VERY SIMILIAR? They, as well as Donkey Kong. You do the same moves in similiar backgrounds and everything N-64 has released is the same game with different characters and titles instead of getting a new game! COME ON PEOPLE THIS IS THE SAME STUFF! But the graphics were good..."
2,.....Yeah....,"I made a wise decion when i rented this game. I was going to buy it, but i wasn't 100% sure of it. I played thought it and i think they did a ok job, but i liked the orginal DK series allot better.They made zelda into a great 3D game, them made mario into a great 3D game but they sure did't make DK into a great 3D game!Overall make sure you rent it first...cause it just might not be what all the hype made it look like...i would never buy this game unless i needed a dust collecter"
5,TERRIFIC MONKEY BUSINESS,"Great fun, The first thing my son did was dance and learn to sing the DK RAP song, he's got the whole family doing it and even if you don't like rap [I do not!] this monkey rap intro is fun.The game is self instructing and builds your skill as you play. It is wonderfully deep and complex so even though my little ones can have fun with it, it challenges teens and adults as well. Several times though I have had to ""break through"" a level so my kids could keep playing the upper levels.I would add a password feature so children could not erase other peoples games and also have more saved game slots 3 isn't enough because of a large family.We have been doing a lot of monkeying around lately, GOOD CLEAN FUN !"
4,Essential analyst training exercise,"This is a reprint of a substantial exercise in both Traffic Analysis and Cryptanalysis of some tough ""classical"" cryptosystems, including Hagelin and Wheatstone machine systems, used to train a generation of NSA and military TAs and cryppies. There is a short introductory chapter to get the reader started. The Military Cryptanalytics series is an essential prerequisite, especially for the cryptanalytic aspect. The bulk of the volume, 375 ""intercepts"" and traffic headers, etc. is nearly a duplicate of the Zendian annex of MilCryp Part 2, Vol. 2, but with larger type; if you have the MilCryp volume, can make out the small type, and don't need a starting hint, this volume would be redundant."
3,A good beginner's reed,"These reeds are easy to blow and have nice stable tone. They lack the volume and crispness of the harder reeds, and don't last as long, but the beginning piper, or pipers with breathing problems, will appreciate the fact that it takes less pressure to get them going."
1,Dave Prochnow's ADD Ramblings,"I am amazed that a giant book publisher, McGraw Hill, would even allow this book to go to print. I have to agree with the other customer reviews. This book was a huge disappointment! Dave Prochnow's book is erratic, confusing, and deficient of practical application. His writing was hard to follow and at times made me wonder why I paid $24.95 to read the ramblings of a person with ADD. In fairness his suggestions on PSP websites and selection of accessories were decent. However, the book lacked goof-proof, insider's guidance!"
4,Beautiful unicorn,This unicorn was very nice quality and prettier in person than in the photo. I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a stuffed animal unicorn.
2,"Too much money for the item, its less at Borders","When I looked at the item I thought I was getting the free shipping because I purchased both at Amazon, but somehow it came out that I got it from another bookstore. I was disapointed because this gift cost me almost twice as much as if I had gotten it at Borders."
5,Multiplex 5x5 Karaoke CDG with Guide Vocal Tracks,"PRIDDIS Multiplex 5X5 MALE COUNTRY 2001 VOLUME 9 araoke CD&G; CD from the High Quality PRIDDIS PRO SOUND COUNTRY collection (1440G), This factory manufactured CD comes in a plastic jewel case, plays the music with or without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G; player. There is also a printed lyrics booklet included so you can use this disk even if you don't have a karaoke player. This CD has 10 tracks total. The first 5 are without vocals and the second 5 are the same songs with guide vocals in one channel for practice purposes. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but are VERY GOOD re-creations.1526G - Coutnry 2001 Volume 91.Love Of Woman - Travis Tritt.2.Real Life - Jeff Carson.3.Will you Marry Me - Alabama.4.Second Wind - Darryl Worley.5.She Couldn't Change Me - Montgomery Gentry."
5,Magnificent!,I really liked this movie and I thought it was very beautiful and the story was well done. I would definatly recomend this movie to anyone who has an open mind and likes foreign films.
5,Get this movie!,"Different, moving, a unique achievement. The other reviewers detail the content - suffice it to say that, for me, the result is superb. I've watched it several times over the past couple of years and intend to continue viewing it periodically."
1,A steaming pile of elitist tosh,"These boring brits are terrible at analysis. These are wannabe sci-fi writers. So I expected them to be snotty, elitist nerds, but they mostly have terrible taste. They enjoy awful episodes like ""Space"" and ""El Mundo Gira"" and hate most of the classic mythology episodes. I don't believe for a second that Paul Cornell is even a fan of the show. Anyone who hates ""One Breath"" yet likes ""Space"" is has no place reviewing this show. The ""analysis"" here is petty and shallow and painfully unfunny. It is also shockingly dull. Between this and that godawful Robert Shearman XF critique book I'm now convinced that anyone associated with Doctor Who are idiots when it comes to good writing."
4,Phwoar means hubba-hubba (I think),"This is the book for anyone trying to figure out what's going on in the X-files. Very humourous, lots of theories and an affectionate look at some of the series' idiosyncrasies. I agree with the reviewer who felt that the book suffered somewhat from trying to 'squeeze' just about everything into the conspiracy. To answer one question below: Phwoar! is a british term of approval on seeing someone who is sexually attractive. It can also apply to a sexually charged situation as in the series. I believe the equivalent US term would be something like ""hubba-hubba""?"
3,a cocky yet specific show-by-show examination,"looking for some hard-core analysis, i was disappointed by the dismissive tones of the authors personal critiques of each episode. though they're writing a book about the show, which would indicate some serious committment, they complain about it an awful lot in nitpicky immature ways. the breakdown of each episode into categories such as ""scully's rational explanation of the week"" and ""the conspiracy starts at closing time"" provide the meat of the book, offering details that reveal the show's consistency and innovativeness, yet the ""bottom line"" sections that offer up the personal views of all three authors are often insipid, shallow and petty, rather than insightful or thought-provoking. the concept for the book is great, but the writers appear to be over-the-top in their sci-fi nerdy elitist attitude- a decent episode guide and that's all."
4,Answer to Just a question,"The answer to Just a question...question, the last song that was played before he was revealed as a geek was I'm Just a Kid by A Simple Plan. Hope we helped."
2,Name of a song....,I was wondering if anyone knew the name of the song when it was played while he was sitting at the bench eating a sandwich and the girl walked over to talk to him and he dropped it on his lap. Any help would be great.
3,What was the song played when the new guy,what is the name of the song (and who sings it) played when the new guy burned the statue and walks away as a kool guy? Very beginning...
2,Some good songs,"There are some good songs but some aren't on the CD. ""Let It Whip"" is really great.For the rap song playing right before he gets to his new school, it is Cypress Hill ""(Rock) Superstar"". When he comes out of the truck, it is Phil Collins singing ""In The Air Tonight"". There are also some good funk music."
3,I Need help on a song,What was the rap song that was played during the football game when they won their first game?
3,play that funky music white boy,"I like the version they play in the movie, it's better than wild cherry. Any1 know who were the singers? and where can i get the song?"
4,Great movie and soundtrack,"in response to the first person who wrote a review, the song you are looking for is by Wild Cherry, and the song title is ""Play That Funky Music White Boy"" they shouldn't have interrupted that song, it's a good song. the only thing bad about this soundtrack is there isn't enough funk on it. the movie was all about da funk, but almost no funk on the soundtrack. still a good soundtrack though."
3,song question,"Hey what is hte song htat is being played thorughout the football games (ithink) its now used in a commericial for a tv sitcom on one of the major networks (cbs, nbc, abc)"
3,question about a song^^,What was the song Dizzy`s band sing without Dizzy and then he come in and they kinda ignore him?
2,"More music, less snot !!","I purchased this DVD because after finding myself listening to the CD sometimes twice a day, I wanted to see Pharoah in action. I also wanted to use this to study his techniques and embouchure since I have been learning to play tenor myself. I was disappointed that there were only two songs from the CD on this DVD. I also thought that it was somewhat disgusting that while watching the third song on the DVD, there were numerous close ups of Sanders playing and you could see snot going in and out of his nose while he was playing. Blow your nose Pharoah ! I purchased the John Coltrane DVD the same time I bought this and I think it is a much better purchase with about 9 or 10 songs on that DVD."
4,Good workout when you don't have all day,"I have two left feet and am admittedly more of a weight training and yoga exerciser than a cardio fan. I liked this workout as it was simple to learn, Tamilee is a good cue-er, and it was short. I do get sweaty. I like the ""tight"" admonishments too. They kept my form from getting sloppy."
5,The best Cardio workout I've ever done!,"This is a fantastic cardio workout! Tamilee knows how to get your heart pumping and your body sweating. I've worked out with several instructors and Tamilee's the best. I consider her my personal trainer. She's not overbearing. She's easy to follow and very knowledgeable. You'll learn the routine after just a couple of times. This workout is 30 minutes long, so I like to follow it with her ""I want that Body"" video for some nice ab and arm toning. Tamilee works out with only 2 other girls so you don't get distracted watching a lot of different people working out at different paces. The instrumental music is great and not at all annoying. I highly recommend this workout to anyone who's got 30 minutes and willing to burn some fat & calories!!"
3,Good for a time crunch,"Although this isn't my favorite fitness DVD, it does get your heartrate up and gives you a fairly good workout if you are in a time crunch. I also travel a lot and wanted a DVD I could play on my laptop in a hotel room that didn't need steps or weights and this fits that bill. When I want a workout, but don't have my usual hour to devote, I pop in Cardio Blast. If you add the 10 minute buns workout that is in the special features you can add to the 30 minutes, which helps a bit. I don't use this DVD in my regular schedule, but like it if I need that change or short workout!"
2,Anyone care for dancy mambos?,"I didn't like this workout at first because the moves change so fast & was hard to keep up. I let it gather dust on the shelf for a year. Now I dusted it off and actually am rather enjoying it! It gives me lots of energy the rest of the day. Since I am editing my original review, I cannot add stars but I give it a 4-star rating now."
5,Awesome cardio!!!!,"I love this video! I've been working out for a long time, consistently, and am fit. I have also taught fitness for several years and was looking for something now that I no longer teach. It's a great cardio workout for home to combine with another. I like the music too (it's not the goofball music a lot of videos choose) and the combinations used are motivating/creative and keep my attention. It's not boring - it does challenge you to follow the routine but isn't so intricate that it takes too long to catch on (I caught on by the second try). Tamilee does a super job cueing and explaining the moves in her no nonsense, straight forward manner. It gets my heartrate going and I sweat a lot by the end. I think it is up to you whether you choose to make it a tougher workout, and Tamilee takes the time to explain how to make it the best workout for your level of fitness. I give this a top rating ----"
4,For my lazy days....,"I bought this DVD hoping for a short but intense cardio workout, but have been a little disappointed. I am in moderately good shape, and this workout did get my heart-rate up, but it never really reached the intensity I was looking for. I think I get more out of breath doing the 10-minute buns workout at the end! This DVD would be good for people who are just starting to get back into shape (although the moves are pretty fast and may not be good for people with joint problems), as a warm-up for strength training, or for days when you don't really want to work out very hard."
3,It's okay,I prefer the Abs and Legs of Steel videos more. This one was different but I didn't care too much for the movements.
3,Good for beginners,"This is an okay video. I like to do a more intense workout personally, so I'd say this one is more for beginners trying to get more intense. It isn't bad, but it isn't exciting. I can't seem to get into it."
2,Not a fan,I am very advanced-- this is not advanced at all. You won't break a sweat-- I recommend this for beginners...
2,Not Tamilee's best,"I am an avid fan of Tamilee's workouts, but this one is not one of her best. I found the moves difficult to follow and not as physically challenging as choreographically challenging. I finished the workout frustrated and feeling that I hadn't really had a very good workout. The Tighter Assets for Weight Loss is a much better workout. This one was disappointing."
2,"Sorry, Tamilee but I hated this","It's too high impact and too repetitive. Although it's format is ideal if you're time crunched, I just can't recommend it. I loved Tamilee's I Want That Body DVD and her other workouts but Cardio Blast is pure torture for me."
3,"Not for breastfeeding mother, bad knees or well endowed","women. I have been doing the Kathy Smith 3 mile Video for the past 4 months. I also walk 2 miles daily, 3 jazzercise classes and swim. And was looking to up my cardio a bit. I have been using this video for a week. And it is great except for some of the moves require a bit of thinking (The scoop, I cannot figure out in my half asleep state), which with a 2 year old, a 6 month old, two 100 pound dogs running around can be a bit diffcult to handle things like the scoop. And I am breastfeeding and fairly well endowed currently, and all the jumping is generally leaves me with a Breastmilk soaked bra and shirt... So after a week, I am off to search out some other video, until I have some time to myself."
3,"Quite dry, not a page turner",This book contains a huge amount of information. The author is staunchly pro-Protestant but seems to save his greatest ire for the inability of Lutheran and Calvinists to cooperate.Fascinating to read a book written before the 1848 revolution.
5,"Finally, baked goods I can make!!","I have been cooking a gluten free dairy free diet for my son for more than two years and had all together given up on bakery type items. Every one I tried had too many unusual flours and was too much work.Since my son has recently taken a liking to baking, I picked this book up and couldn't be happier with it.The recipes are easy, have few ingredients, and simple steps so my three year old and I can make them together.So far, we have had great luck with every recipe.This book makes doing a gluten free diet seem like much less work and expense, and the look on my sons face when he tasted the snickerdoodles ( hes never eaten any cookie like them) was priceless.Good luck and if you think this diet is too hard, try cooking out of this book for a while--the thought of me making donuts was laughable until I started using this book!!"
5,Quickly became a fan of Roben Ryberg's style of cooking,"Although I'm grateful for all those out there that have published a GF cookbook for those of us with gluten intolerance, I find this book offers several benefits over the others. I didn't realize how grainy my rice flour recipes tasted until I tried Roben's Pumpkin Bread, Egg Bread, and Hot Crossed Bun recipes. And even though the consistency was different than I was used to with gluten cooking, the recipes I tried turn out perfectly the first time. It's important to follow the recipes exactly and trust the measurements given. A GF friend of mine also loves the Buttermilk Bread and I plan on trying that next. My gluten-eating friends enjoyed the Pumpkin Bread as much as I did too. Another benefit is that the ingredients are much easier to find and less intimidating so other people that don't usually cook gluten-free are asking for the recipes so they can make something for me too. Thank you, Ms. Ryberg!"
4,Needs different directions,"We like this book but we have modified the directions which seems to make things come out a bit ""fluffier.""I had been cooking for many years before my son was diagnosed with Celiac Disease. The directions for these recipes surprised me because the author simply throws everything, wet and dry ingredients, into a bowl and mixes. I thought at first that this must be the way to make gluten-free food since it uses different flours than I am used to. But the results were not the best, in my opinion. Now I mix the dry and wet ingredients seperately before mixing them together, just as I did in the ""old days,"" and everything comes out much ""lighter"" and slightly less chewy. We are as pleased as you can be with gluten-free food after a lifetime of eating the real thing."
3,simple,"This book did not meet my expectations.What I did not like:- The breads tasted too much like baking soda,- Cookies did NOT work at all, they turned into a big melted mess- Crepes tasted like a sweet omeletWhaT i DID like:- Boston cream pie- vanilla puddingThis is a last resort book when you are in a hurry."
3,"Main Dishes Okay, Bakery Items Not","Roben Ryberg uses only cornstarch and potato flour starch in the book's recipes as a way of ""saving money"" for the person on a gluten- or wheat-free diet. Unfortunately, those two ingredients have negligible amounts of fiber or protein--necessary ingredients in baking, and the reason why rice flour in normally used in such items. I tried three of the recipes--two breads and one cookie, and all were disasters (a person doesn't save money if they have to keep throwing things out). I have tried similar recipes from other sources which used rice flour ingredients and have had great success--even those without my dietary needs have repeatedly consumed the results!! But the book does have some good recipes--I thought the rosemary chicken recipe was sublime."
2,"Good Book, I just can't use it","I just received my copy of ""The Gluten-Free Kitchen"", and unfortunately I am the exact opposite of another reviewer -- I can ONLY use rice flour, I am also allergic to corn and potatoes; this book doesn't use rice flour at all, but uses cornstarch and potato starch, darn it, so I can't use it at all. It looks like a really good book, just wanted to draw attention to which starches are used, in case anybody else has the same dumb multiple allergies as me. Otherwise, the information in this book is very good."
5,A life saver..,"This book has been a lifesaver for my family. 2 of my children and myself have CD, and HATE the premade frozen breads and baked goods made with rice flours. Although I have quite a few cookbooks on hand, Roben's use of potato starch and cornstarch as the main flours produces the most delicious and EASY baked goods we have had in months. My girls love the Buttermilk Loaf bread recipe. Sure, other cookbooks have great recipes if you have the resources to purchase 5 different flours and spend hours in the kitchen. Honestly this book has changed our lives, I highly recommend it."
2,Allergies,"Nearly all of these recipes call for cornstarch. Many gluten free eaters are also allergic to corn. Yes, you can substitute arrowroot for cornstarch, but it is much more expensive and no guarantee the recipes will work.I did like the style of writing and the selection of recipes and thought the introductory information was well written and helpful."
5,Terrific Gluten Free Cookbook,The carrot cake recipe was the first baked product I had after being gluten free for months. It was wonderful! The entire family has enjoyed every recipe we have tried. We have had two Gluten Free Kitchens wear out from making our favorites so I will be purchasing a third. Since the family also has allergies to rice the Gluten Free Kitchen is a perfect gluten free cookbook for our family.
4,Great tasting recipes!,"My cousin found this book in our local Rochester, NY grocery store (Wegmans). I have tried the snickerdoodles, lemon cookie bars, and apple crisp. DIVINE! Most GF recipes call for rice flour, which often turns baked goods into crumbly messes that don't have a ""normal"" consistency. My only suggestion is to watch the fat/cholesterol content. Many of the dessert recipes call for at least a 1/2 cup of shortening. But the book is great alternative for those sick of using/cannot find unusual flours."
3,Very Average Gluten-Free Cookbook,"I've tried at least 15 of the recipes in the book with mixed results. About half of the time, the output is poor (e.g. gummy, heavy, thick. undercooked, overcooked, etc.). The other half of the time, the product was fine. Let me state that I consider myself a very proficient cook and baker. When trying recipes, I'm meticulous about the ingredients, the measurements and the temperature. I would say this cookbook will help you output gluten-free substitutes for popular gluten dishes. HOWEVER, the products will be ""average"" and not of the high-quality that will make eaters say ""Wow! That was delicious. May I have the recipe?"" Keep this in mind when buying this cookbook."
1,Too much corn,"The Gluten Fee Kitchen book by Roben Ryberg is a great recipe book if you are truly looking for gluten free recipes without any other food limitation. I ordered the book with out looking at any of the recipes or indigents used. My mistake! Not only do I have a sensitivity to gluten but also to corn. Every recipe uses large amounts of cornstarch instead of other types of flour. The other ingredient that is used quite frequently, however not to the same extent of cornstarch, is Xantham gum. I have hesitation using Xantham gum, mainly because its fermented corn sugar. Studies have confirmed residual wheat gluten to be detected in xanthan gum. It's a double whammy, corn and and wheat. Xantham gum has been found as a link to respiroatory symptoms and is an effective laxative. So why would I want to add that to my food, even if it is less then one teaspoon? The exssive use of corn products in ""The Gluten Fee Kitchen Book"" is useless to anybody who is trying to avoid corn."
2,skip this book,"This cookbook was very disappointing. I've tried several of the cookie recipes and gotten just wafers. Yes, my baking powder was fresh. I found at least one recipe that has ingredients missing. I don't recommend this author."
2,Gluten Free,I was sort of disappointed with this....the recipes are not as diverse as I would have liked. More deserts and I was not interested in deserts.What could I do with gluten free bread? I should have done more research before I ordered this.
2,Irresponsible in it's lack of nutrition,"Our family has been gluten free for almost a year and we've read every cookbook printed on the subject. This is by far the unhealthiest one we've run across. Every recipe in it uses exclusively potato starch and corn starch, neither of which contains much in the way of nutrients. There are many tasty, nutritious, gluten and rice free alternative flours, such as: sorghum, quinoa, almond, teff, montina and millet to name a few. Quinoa, millet and almonds are available in every grocery store in their whole form and are easily ground at home in a coffee grinder. Baking with these healthy ingredients as your main flours and lightening with about 30% starch turns out delicious and healthy treats. Our current favorite gluten free baking book is Baking Classics by Annalise G. Roberts. Delicious and healthy recipes that all work everytime. Additionally Mrs. Ryberg's suggestion to use carrageenan as a binder is ill advised as it is a proven carcinegen."
1,Chameleon Twist in a bad return to the Nintendo world.,I just purchased this game today. I suggest you don't waste your money. I don't know about you... but I loved this game for the battles with 1 on 1 combat with tongues. In this game there is no 2-4 player combats. Its just the game itself. I suggest that you dont bye this game from ToysRus either. They do not let you return games after you buy them. What a waste of money.
5,Almost like being there!,"I picked up a copy of Deborah's book at the Maui Writer's Retreat. Now that I am at home and reading it, I feel like I never left that Pacific paradise. The emotions are raw and you want to just hold these characters and never let them go. This is a wonderful first novel. I am going to recommend it to all I meet."
2,Valiant attempt,"Iida misses the boat. She has a beautifully rich concept, ripe with possibilities, but does not rightfully fulfill the potential her characters beg for. I was utterly disappointed and surprised that the novel has received some noteworthy acclaim. Though she captures the pigeon English the Japanese Hawaiians utilize as their principle speech, this alone does not warrant 200 pages. Iida seems to be a novice writer who needs instruction on structure and how to sustain drama. The mystery of the story is sodden and weak and not enough to will us to the end of the piece. I am sorry I did not like this more."
1,she no talk right,"I read this book as a required reading in high school. It was the first time we actually read a book about life in Hawaii, and I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The novel has a decent storyline, but that is about it. It's hard enough for local writers to master literary use of pidgin, let alone someone from the mainland. I am not holding the author's background against her, I am just saying that the attempt at making the characters ""local"" was not very successful. As a result, any power in the story is lost as the reader stumbles and trips through the forced pidgin. If you are not from Hawaii, find another book to help you discover the people and culture of the islands. And if you are from Hawaii, don't read this book unless you want to suffer through it really bad (believe me, it's just as hard to read as it is to hear)."
3,Great idea...but get the larger size,"I have a 10 lb. Shih Tzu and I purchased the Medium thinking that should work well and honestly...she comes close to falling out if I lean forward even just a little. I like the idea and she enjoys being in front of everything because I have backpack she isn't crazy about, so if you are thinking about this...go for the larger size."
3,Place this on the Reference Shelf,1) I bought this book to learn about Aphorism's2) I started to read it and found that I wanted to just skim it for the neat Aphorism's3) After skimming I saved the book for the stories around the people that gave us the Aphorism.4) I entered any Aphorism I thought was great in my Evernote account for quick reference5) I placed this on my writing reference shelf6) I will pull this book out again when I have a witty Aphorism and need the story behind it7) Don't have high expectations - Think Reference
2,All breadth and no depth,The author introduces us to one aphorist after another and teases with just the lightest sample from each. He attempts to be spare and comprehensive and would have been better choosing. You'll find very few new aphorisms and little new history. I regret my purchase.
2,Not So Much a History of Aphorisms as the Author's Manifesto,"I was rather hoping for a history of aphorisms. What we are treated to instead is a brief biography of each of the author's favorite thinkers, some of whom are actually aphorists, and some of whom require stretching the definition beyond breaking. (Emily Dickinson as aphorist? Really?) As he admits on the penultimate page, ""This book is my bible."" If you're looking for a book outlining James Geary's philosophy of life as projected onto various writers throughout history, this is your book. If you're actually looking for a history of the aphorism, your search continues."
5,Thought Provoking,"Very interesting, and Philosophical. James Geary gives brief backgrounds on the authors and insight into their ways of thinking. Keep a dictionary close. I found this book to be an amazing vocabulary builder."
5,Love it,"I love this series so much that I bought it for my 12 year old nephew. He deserves to have a good TV show in his life. If you can get past some of the gore, this is a great anime. If not, buy some Avatar: The Last Airbender until they are old enough"
4,Great anime,This anime is a must have for anime lovers. The packaging it arrived in wasn't that great but it plays fine. I'm happy I bought it!
4,Contains some but not all of the original story,"Well, if you seen my review for the second season set, it's the same for this one as well.So if your a fan of fullmetal alchemist, I encourage you to buy this in hopes that the lady who made the original manga can get some money off this awesome series."
5,Great Anime,The first season of fullmetal alchemist is amazing. There are five dvds and the excitement is nonstop. Be prepared for awesomeness!!!
3,okay but could've been better,"this book was alright but i get tired of catty always not trusting stanton and serena, it gets old and i also think that catty should've stayed with chris but other then that this book was good"
2,Disapponting 11th in Great New Series,"this book, while part of a great new series, is heading downhill from previous books. i loved 1-8 and 10 but i also thought 9 was going downhill also. the major prblem seems to be adding to many new twists and surpirises that its hard to keep up and fousing to much on one character in each book. Also, the end of book 10 should have at least been partley explained."
5,WHAT HAPPENS??????????,"I have not read this yet because I can't find it. So....WHAT HAPPENS?????????? If you have read this, please type a review and answer these questions for me. I promise I'll still buy the book, though; I have more questions than I care to type.Questions:1) Does anything happen with Stanton & Serena?2) Who is Catty's dad?3) What is the deal with Jimena?4) Is Tianna evil?If you know these answers, PLEASE type a review up so I can read them!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not so good...,"I have to say that this is the first book in this series that I didnt love. Catty has changed so much since book 4. Its like she's not even the same person. I liked her much better before. And Catty and Chris SHOULD be together. I cant believe she just forgot about him like she did. I mean, when he ""left"" (I dont want to say why he left, it'll ruin the ending), Catty just stood there, she didn't even care. I cant stand Kyle, Chris was so much better. And I dont like how Tianna all of a sudden turned bad. I mean, there's no proof of it, but after reading this book, you kind of get an idea. I really liked her, and its a shame that she has to be the one to go bad.The only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead of 1 star is because it was interesting getting to meet Catty's dad, and Nefandus was a pretty cool place."
5,The Prophecy,"This book is awesome! It's so exciting and unpredictable! But the characters have changed so much since book 9. For instince Catty is really self-conscience, Vanessa is a lot more rebelious, can control her powers a lot better, and gets even more brave than she already was. Tianna's powers weaken and she seems less confident. Catty also begins to get suspisious of her for some very good reasons... Serena's power gets a lot better, but she seems really nosy and is always looking at parts of Catty's mind that she shouldn't. She's also hanging out with Stanton a lot more and hardly ever hanging out with the other daughters. And then there is Jimena, who's intuition seems to be so in tune that she shows up just in the nick of time to rescue the daughters on more than one occasion."
4,Great,"This book was awsome! but not my favorite. I have been waiting a really long time to read this and i was a little sad about the ending. I would give it a 4 1/2 but thats not an option. The only reason i went lower was because its Just wasnt as good as the really great ones. Like the 3rd, 5th, and 10th book."
5,I Love the Daughters of the Moon,"I didn't think the books could get better than my favorite The Sacrifice but in my opinion this one is. Catty is now my favorite character. Well, maybe she always was my favorite because she doesn't care if she gets herself into trouble. I love the beginning of this book when she meets Kyle and the book only gets better when the Daughters of the Moon try to steal the Secret Scroll until the end which made me sad and happy. The end surprised me though because I had it figured out another way."
2,"Only for a beginner, and not terribly informative","Expectations of visual and historical information for this expensive book should be high. But exceptionally poor photography and lack of any rigorous understanding of the history of jewelry and design in the text from these authors rate this book a tepid two stars only. It should have been better, coming from this antique specialty publisher, since it is a facinating subject, and there isn't much available in print."
1,The cover of the book has scratches and looks used.,The quality of the book is very bad its looks like it has been used already.I am not happy with the book and was going to send it back. Although when I checked the price to send it back and found it was AUD30 i have decided not to send it back. It is not worth paying $30 to send it back.Very disappointed.Anna Mcnamara
5,"This works just as it was intended to, no problems whatsoever! I would definitely purchase it again, but there will be no need!","This works just as it was intended to, no problems whatsoever! I would definitely purchase it again, but there will be no need!"
5,not what I needed,this pot looks like the 10 cup pot i needed but was not i needed; this is a great pot replacement for an individual looking to repalce a 4 cup pot
4,Great Replacement,I purchased this for my parents when their carafe was accidently broken. They were surprised to receive it in the mail as I had not mentioned it to them. We had shopped around for a small carafe but the prices were a bit steep so I was very happy when I found this one on Amazon. As always great service at a great price.
2,not worth buying online,"these tattoos look fine, but only have a very few in a pack. definitely not worth buying online bc they get sent in this ridiculous, wasteful packaging. just go to your local museum or little toy shop to pick up a pack."
2,Not German; not stainless; not adjustable,"Despite the German cutlery hype, these shears are stamped as Made in China, and the quality matches the typical cheap Chinese products. Not too bad out of the box, but mine dulled quickly. After a year of light use, they now barely cut cooking twine. Although these are advertised as adjustable, which would be nice, the tension nut seems to be peened over and does not turn. The steel is very hard, making sharpening difficult, but is not true stainless steel, or it would not stick to my magnetic knife holder. These shears are acceptable for ""skinning chicken,"" as advertised, but one can do that with one's fingers. If I wanted cheap Chinese shears, I would have gone to Walmart and paid $5. Actually, my $5 Walmart shears held an edge longer than these.On the pro side, the handle is comfortable for someone with large hands and the shears are balanced well and light-weight. Now, if they would just cut..."
2,Can't agree with Cooks Illustrated,"I bought these following the Cooks Illustrated review a few years ago. While they are billed as utility shears, I can't see them doing anything more challenging than parting a chicken, so maybe they should change the title to ""poultry shears."" Any other household cutting tasks I've used them for have nicked the blades.Also, there is a major flaw in the design concerning how they separate. There should be some locking mechanism that prevents separation in case the shears swing open. I found this out the hard way using them to trim some threads from some window treatments I had sewn and used these shears because they were handier than running back up to the 3rd story sewing room. While holding the shears with one hand and holding the thread with another, the shears swung open and became detached. With a normal set of shears, this wouldn't have been an issue. Instead, it separated, fell apart and landed point down, gouging my midcentury bar cabinet. Ouch."
2,Disappointing,"I have had these shears for about a year now, and I am already in the market for a new pair. I primarily use my kitchen shears to cut poultry. These shears worked well for a few months, but they got dull very quickly. By the 6 month mark, I was no longer able to comfortably cut the backbone out of a chicken (which is mostly cutting through thick skin). They are fine for snipping herbs or other simple kitchen chores, but I am disappointed that less than a year later I have to buy a new pair of poultry shears."
1,Fine German Cutlery,"The manufacturer lists itself as a manufacturer of fine German cutlery. The product is their DN-1070. Look it up and zoom in on the picture and you will see that it is manufactured in China. Nowhere in the description is it listed as made in China. Perhaps it is just my take, but I want to know where a product is made. So far, there is not one item that I have purchased, from China, that does not have an immediate defect, or one that does not develop after use. Messermeister is off my buying list. This item is not German quality."
2,Made in CHINA,"I received my Messermeister utility shears today and was very surprised to find that they are MADE IN CHINA. I was specifically looking for shears NOT made in China, and was led to believe that Messermeister was still made in Germany. Well, wrong! They look OK, although I have not opened the plastic wrap. Note that these are ""scissors"" not ""shears"", as most of us would expect a serrated blade on kitchen utility shears. I am returning them unopened."
1,Cook's Illustrated is wrong on this one,Two major problems with these kitchen shears: 1) they disassemble so easily that they are always falling apart even while using; 2) the cutting area is too short for effective use when taking apart whole chickens. Definitely not worth the $25. Going back to the traditional German-made kitchen shears.
1,Bent out of shape after dismantling a chicken,"They were great for light-duty tasks in the kitchen/home, but after I dismantled a raw chicken, they no longer aligned properly and essentially ceased to cut paper or plastic bags. Fine for heavy-duty, crude cutting but that's it. Rather disappointed. As has been noted, well-reviewed on Cook's Illustrated which from all that I can tell is just a subscription to ads. Sticking with Amazon from now on!"
2,"Sharp and Comfortable, Rusting","The soft handles on these are dramatically more comfortable than my roommate's Cutco shears. The edge is quite sharp, and just as importantly, the cutting action is very smooth. Easy to take apart for cleaning. It says the steel is made in China. I often hear about problems with steel made in China, so that might be a hit to its longevity, but there is no sign of that in the workmanship or performance as of now.Edit: I've dropped this from a 5 star to 2 star review. I stand by the performance and comfort statements. However, after one trip through the dishwasher, these ""dishwasher safe"" shears have a bit of rust developing on them. This is simply not acceptable. I did not keep the original packaging, thinking they would last me a long time. I was wrong. Otherwise, I would be attempting to return these."
1,save some money and buy a better product,"Bought these to replace a cheap pair of shears that were rusting. But, if you spread these shears apart more than an inch they become unhinged. If you look at the picture, you will see the cut-out in one of the blades that grabs on the other blade and unhinges the shears as you are trying to open them to cut. We are buying another Wusthoff pair which has worked flawlessly for years and actually costs less. We were just interested in this one since it seemed to have a narrower blade.I really can't understand the 5 star ratings on this product (which is partially what we based our purchase on). They must have never used a better pair of kitchen shears."
2,Don't rely on Cooks Illustrated for this one!,"This is the second item that CI was totally off the mark on. Unless I got a defective model, this is probably the WORST pair of kitchen shears I've had and that number is 4 and counting. You must use the tips ONLY, if trying to cut ANYTHING! I find this to be true with most kitchen shears. Also, as several others commented, they come apart while you're using them....it shouldn't be that easy to clean them....I'm using them to cut, first and foremost. And, again,no German craftsmanship here....unlessGermany moved East. Junk quality! I'll go back to my Pampered Chef's ...at least they stay stay connected while you're using them."
3,Works but...,It works but the finger holes are not quite the correct angle for cutting. It does what it is supposed to do though.
2,not happy with these,I would not reccomend these. they do come apart like they name implies. unfortunatally - they don't stay together very well.
3,Poultry shears,"I purchased these shears based on the recommendation at Amazingribs.com (a great site for bbq advice and information). These shears are strong, sharp and well-built. I'd give them five stars except for the flat-head screwdriver fixture on the handle. When I'm cutting thru the backbone of a large chicken and have to torque it down to break the bone the screwdriver head bites into the palm of my hand. I have no idea why this feature would be included (pry off tops?) but it is useless and a detriment. The first time I used it I actually made a small cut in my hand.I'll keep using them because they do cut well, I just need to be careful."
2,Not that great,I bought these because Cooks Illustrated gave them a very positive review. I bought several pairs figuring I could give them as stocking stuffers to my adult children who all are fairly serious cooks. I tried them and they were mediocre at best. They weren't sharp and it was difficult to cut even boneless chicken breasts with them. It was like the scissors were gumming the meat. I returned all but the pair I used. I have others from Chicago Cutlery (which also come apart for cleaning) which seem to be much stronger and sharper.
5,Finally! I can butterfly a chicken!,"This baby cuts through chicken backbones like buttah! Other shears may do the same, but not without a struggle. By far, though, the best part of this item is that it comes apart easily for thorough cleaning. No chance of bad chicken vibes hanging around on this pair of shears. Easy to disassemble and reassemble."
5,Leveraging Good Will,"Navigating the boardroom experience is tough, and every board experience is unique. It is especially challenging to be responsible to chair and lead a board,and it is equally important to be an active and participatory board member. Korngold provides wise counsel based on her vast experience. I encourage board members and nonprofit executives to read "" ""Leveraging Good Will"" in order to lean how to add value and help make boards and organizations better and stronger in serving our communities."
2,A Disappointment,"I had respect for Prof. Wheeler, and so this book came as a tremendous disappointment. It does little but trot out all the latest fringe 'theories' about a woman who has already been the subject of numerous myths and dubious theories already."
1,Dissapointing,"Is this book about Healthy Homes/MCS or Envrionmentally Friendly Homes or Energy Efficient Design? It tries to do all three and ends up doing none of them well.There is not much current information about toxic building materials/multiple chemical sensivity. If that is what you are looking for, Paula Baker Laporte and John Bower are much better choices.The case studies are outdated. Typical of architects, there are a bazillion architectural building details that you may or may not find useful. As a Home Builder, I found this book a waste of time and money.On the plus side, there is a lot information about water purification systems. It has the prettiest cover of any of the Healthy House books I have seen."
4,Healthy helps,"As a new homeowner, I like this book. It deals with older homes, which I have and actually supplies information that I paid someone to give me. Here it is for the cost of the book. I recommend this for people who own their first home and especially if you are chemically sensitive or chemically aware (of potential dangers)..There are many books on the market. This one seemed very useful to me.The only reason I rated it 4 rather than 5 is that it didn't do the work for me. !!!"
4,Best read as individual chapters,"The authors make nice but grand claims about the development of instruments for science, worldwide. The book describes several cases that can be read as fascinating and important historical episodes. Like the development of accurate clocks, that could be used by travellers, especially on ships.But I found these chapters to be rather standalone. Certainly, overall they describe the onward march of science, enabled greatly by the instruments that are the true heroes of the chapters. And they are quite well researched and written. The authors are very capable in this regard.The problem is in the attempt to spin a greater thread between the chapters. Given that each chapter was written by a separate author, this was probably to be expected."
2,Get Operation Petticoat Instead,I own and enjoy several old comedies based on a similar theme. This one does not measure up. Get Operation Petticoat instead.
3,"Yup, Gary Cooper.",Not one of Coopers better movies. It has its lighter side of naive officer trying to make a project work that haqs more downs than ups
4,You're In the Navy Now,This item came prior to the expected delivery date in perfect condition. We were pleased with the transaction.
3,Hi jinks in the navy,"Gary Cooper and the rest of the cast do a great job with a less than perfect script, but the film is fun to watch and worth the time. More for laughs than action"
5,An underrated classic gem,"I can't describe how great this game is. It's pure genius. If you don't already have this, then I want to know what's stopping you from buying this. Trust me, it's a great game."
5,Clean and great to keep forever,"This game is great!!I love it so much!! It is good for ages because it has no blood or privledges to kill and steal, even though you wreck, this game is is a one of a kind game ,making this a Grand theft auto type for anyone."
3,BLOW STUFF UP!,"If you like blowing stuff up, this game is for you. Control a variety of construction (or destruction) vehicles to clear the way for a leaking nuclear tanker. Ok, so maybe the plot leaves a little to be desired, but the action and strategy will bring you back again and again. One of my favorite features of this game (designers take note) is that the game teaches you how to play in the first few levels. Some of the later levels are a little harder than I think they needed to be, but the bonus levels and hidden secrets give it a good amount of replay value."
1,Blast Bore,"Do not rent this game. It is (A) a waste of three bucks, (B) a horrible game, and (C) you can't win! What the heck is the object of the game? There's nothing to do! You complete objectives and then... what? don't rent this game, rent GOLDENEYE 007--- IT'S AWESOME!"
2,I WASTED MY WEEKEND,"When I first saw this game I thought it would be great, Right? WRONG! This game is terribly frustrating. The controls are sloppy, the graphics lack depth and the vehicles are murder to control. The Harbor level was the hardest and most challenging. You have to blast your was across a harbor to prevent the missile carrier and every move has to be PRECISE!. If you make even just one mistake then it will cost you the level and you will have to start over. Tak my advice and DO NOT BUY OR EVEN RENT THIS GAME! The only good part about it is when you rent it and someone has beaten all the levels and you can goof around all you want but even that gets old. FICKEN MIT SIE BLAST CORPS! FICKEN MIT SIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Nauseating!,"I remember burrowing this from a friend because I ran out of N64 games to play so I burrowed this and some other games for a few days. I have to say it was fun at first, than it became frustrating, and than I felt like I was going to throw up because of the weird controls and this and that moving around in weird places which I didn't intended in doing. It was also because I was really young then and I really didn't know what the game was really about, which is puzzle solving sometimes.I advise not buying the game, instead tell your friend to buy it because its the best game ever and take it from him when he wants to throw it out. Of course you'll lose a friend, but well worth it! Game > Friendship. I'm just playing kids."
1,Warning: DO NOT BUY!,"This is quite possibly the worst video game in the entire history of video games. There is NO plot and the graphics leave much to be desired. There really is no point to the game. The levels are dull with no real excitement. As soon as I started playing I felt compelled to turn it off and demand that I get my money back. It is about a bunch of construction vehicles. NOT THAT EXCITING! I have had more fun staring at walls than I had playing this game (not that I stare at walls too often). If you purchase this game, return it immediately from whence it came. They should have to pay the customer to play it. It's that bad."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS BIG TIME,"This game is so boring all you do is go around destroying buildings and cleanimg something that my brother doesn't even know, and he's like the best gamer in the world. DON'T BUY THIS GAME BUY 007 OR WRESTLEMANIE 2000!"
3,Fun,"It's fun to destroy stuff in this game. Blowing up whole towns just doesn't get old. I don't know how successful this game was, but it seems it was underrated. I rented it once and enjoyed it a lot. The only problem I had with it was it got pretty difficult after finishing some of the easier levels, and I don't think there were all that many easy levels."
3,Cereal dispenser from plastic,"This does the job, even though it's kind of flimsy. It is proof of the say ing you get what you pay for. After that I must say I am able to fill my cereal bowl with a few twists of the knob."
2,Fair,Does not heat well even if directions are followed and poorly fits the contours of the head once heating gels pads are inserted.
3,Not for long hair,"This product should mention it's dimension because it does not work for long hair. The heat level it's good but only have it on the front and the sides, back part I did not feel it. The ear protecting pads on long hair does not go on top of ear. So if you have medium to short hair this is something you want to invest your money other wise not."
3,My Thermal Spa Hair Wrap,"It does what its suppose to do, except it is somewhat small for my head. Heats for at least 20 min, and is comfortable, the price was right and I really can not think of anything that is wrong with it."
4,"Worked well, but not made very well...","I just used this for the first time and one of the seams ripped as I was inserting a gel pack. I did not force gel pack in, so the seam must have been already loose. Once I had the hat on, it did not fit very well. It fell off several times. However, it did stay nice and warm and I feel it did a good job with my deep conditioner, so I will use it again. I guess I will sew the seam back and try to figure out a better way it make it stay put during use."
3,"Great, but doesn't last long.","This really helped deep conditioner absorb in my hair but if you leave it in the microwave just a few seconds too long it's ruined. You have to heat it at 15 second intervals with a maximum of 90 seconds. I know, sounds easy but I've gone through 3 so far and am going to try the battery operated one instead. I'm hoping that the battery powered one heats more evenly as well."
2,Short-Term Use,"I bought this cap from another site and although it works well, it cannot get as warm as you'd need it to be for deep conditioning nor does it stay warm for a long time. I used this product ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS and the packs burst and the gel hardened. I called the place I got it from and they do not sell refill packs. I have yet to find any place that does. So now, this product is basically a towel. It was okay while it lasted though but if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Doesn't last long and not worth the money,"I bought this less than a month ago and the first time I used it it worked great. A day later one of the silicone pockets popped in the microwave and it burst, it had been taken out of the hair cap and this was my own fault I should have followed instructions. After that incident I continued to use it minus the pocket that burst. I would microwave it for 1 minute and I had no problems with it. Then another pocket burst while it was in the microwave and this time I had followed the instructions! I have decided to go back to my old method of just using a wet warm towel to deep condition my hair and am getting rid of the hair therapy cap."
5,"Magic, Adventure, & PEOPLE","Once again, McMorrow has created a society where mage power and mundane life are completely and logically integrated and magic functions and is possessed according to interesting, believable rules.The characters hold a reader. Each is a unique personality. One cares what happens to them and is curious about their future. In fact, I shall be seriously annoyed if there is no sequel to this tale. In this book, the heroine discovers that she possesses a measure of mage power. She also discovers that she has some sound friends and that she must find the skill and courage to back them, even as they must to back her. I want to know what becomes of them.I shall not spoil the story for anyone by recounting it, but this book is a good, enjoyable read in itself, for younger people and for their elders."
3,Below Expected but starting to appreciate,"I was expecting a highly citrusy scent at the beginning and a frankincense dry down. It was a linear scent just like most attars. But this one has a faint citrus scent to it and most of the time soapy, with some powdery facets. It was fresh though. I was disappointed at first, but then I found a way how to wear it by layering."
1,I couldn't GIVE it away,This video was so bad it was painful to watch. I tried to give it to several people. They would watch it once and not take it. At first I tried to sell it but had no success. I had to throw it away. Yes it is that bad. The biggest waste of money I ever had.
1,Worst DVD Ever,"I didn't have any options to give this a zero star because it won't let you pick zero stars so I was forced to pick one star. This is the worst DVD that I have ever purchased. The creators of this DVD tried to imitate the movie Eyes Wide Shut throughout this ""movie"" and they actually made it worse. This is absolute train wreck and I am very surprised Penthouse would release such a poor quality DVD under its banner. Nothing here to ""look at"" if know what I mean, you will do far better at a Rated-R movie then watching this crap."
2,Two volumes: LOUD AND LOUDER,"As a caregiver I wanted this unit to alert me at night when the patient gets up or out of bed. It can do that but the alarm is so incredibly loud it wakes everyone in the house! I even went so far as to duct tape the speaker and wrap the unit in a blanket and it is still TOO LOUD. It has two settings, loud and louder. Would a simple volume control on the unit be too much to ask for? The lack of a volume control saves money for the manufacturer but makes the unit nearly useless for the consumer."
2,Caveat emptor,We purchased this alarm so that we would know when our infant daughter wakes up before she gets all upset. It worked well enough for what it was supposed to do for two months and then just gave up the ghost. It turned out that it has NO WARRANTY so the Posey company must be aware of the reliability issues.
1,Is No Star An Option?,"I ordered this product and received the much cheaper and entirely worthless Wander Alarm instead. The Wander Alarm works fine when first tested, but once it has been on for a little while, it no longer registers when the beam is broken. We tried different batteries, different locations and nothing helped. I did some research, including calling Posey directly, and found that the Posey alarm is on back order. Some other medical supply companies said that it had been on back order quite a while. Posey does not sell directly to the public and did say that the item was on back order.So save your money and order something else. If you really want the Posey item, then call around to find someone that can get it - or call Posey direct and they will tell you which companies carry there products."
4,Great Pool Toy,Nice pool toy for summer days. Seems bigger in internet but is okay for 3 kids at time under six years. We bought for a pool princess birthday . The kids loved this inflatable castle.
2,Gungrave is not good,"If you like to dress up as japanese anime characters and hang out at a convention center then by all means throw down fifty bucks, but for anyone wanting a good playable video game. Run away. This game looks great and has all the visuals down including all the john woo esque gunplay. However, the gameplay is nonexistent. You could beat this game with your feet, all you do is press one button over and over and over and over until everything dies. You're pretty much impervious to damage, which is good since you move slower than one of those veritech fighters in that bad robotech game. Your choice."
4,MADNESS,"If you love the simplicity of destroying everything in your sight, then this is the game for you. No need to think, just destroy. If you like tight graphics along with Anime, this is a definite buy. Again, this game gives you the simple things some of us enjoy, destruction."
2,doesnt have the song from the trailer?,"I was looking for the song played in the movie trailer at the end where a women sings the lyrics, ""breathe, just breathe"". It is not listed in the sample list. Does anyone know where to find that song?"
5,Catch and Release soundtrack,I loved the Catch and Release soundtrack and would recommend it to anyone! The music is upbeat but yet soft enough for any occasion! Although #4 is a must dance to song!
5,Wonderful mood music,This soundtrack is wonderful. It's very calming and reminds me of the scenery and smiles from the movie. You will discover new artists that you'll want to know more about. Excellent as a complete CD. You can play it from beginning to end.
5,Love this soundtrack!,"I LOVE this soundtrack. I keep it in my car. When my husband gets in my car, he puts it in if I don't already have it playing. If I don't watch him, my CD may come up missing!"
2,I should have known better.,"I'm a big fan of Larry Coryell, but when he goes all fusion-y, he loses me every time. In addition to a program of jazz-fusion arrangements, what passes for the drums/percussion on this CD just shuffles along clumsily. Beautiful playing by Coryell and others is obscured by virtual accompaniment. If you like fusion style jazz, please read this as FIVE STARS and buy my copy."
4,"nice case, too small","we ordered this case for my son's acoustic bass. it ended up being too short, and i think his bass is a pretty standard size. the case is nice, but it was totally too small. what a hassle to have to pay $27 to ship back. never would have ordered it if i thought it might not fit. beware!"
3,Heavy on Quilts & Storytelling; Light on Mystery,"In this book, Benni Harper, who is recently married to the Chief of Police, Gabe Ortiz, finds the dead body of one of the storytellers from the museum. Since she knows the victim and the suspects she tries to stay out of the investigation, but everyone thinks she knows more than she does.I found the ending quite unsatisfying -- not because of who is revealed as the murderer, but the way in which this is discovered.I also found Gabe's self-righteous macho posturing too much to take. He is at least as much to blame for the problems between him and his son, Sam, as Sam is. How could Sam not be troubled with a father who can't find anything good about him?"
5,"a wonderful, exquisite book","Earlene Fowler has done it again. She has written a suspense filled mystery with family problems, mayhem and humor thrown in. In this one, Gabes's son comes back to see his father. Family strife results. Benni's Gramma Dove's sister, garnet comes from Arkansas and all heck breaks loose, though it's sidesplitting at the same time. You will absolutely love it. Vetern fans of her will enjoy this and one who haven't read her yet are in for a wonderful introduction to Mrs. Fowler's work."
4,Blanket support,I bought one for myself and really like it for keeping the weight off my feet. If you do not give it extra cover length it pulls out during the night. I ordered one for my sister and she couldn't use it because with a thick mattress and extra memory foam the arms are too short.
4,Does the basics.,"This is working well. The coating on the frame protects the blanket and I did not have a problem with it collapsing during the night. I do not have a pillow top, so it lifts the blanket high enough."
3,Cheap but got it to work,"Completely NOT adjustable. All it is, is some heavy gauge wire with plasti-coat and some end caps. I had to bend the upright arms in to make it work for me, otherwise the gap was too wide and it did not hold the blankets off my feet. It's fine for what it is, being the cheapest blanket support lift I could find. Might've been easier/cheaper to just buy PVC pipes & elbows and make my own.."
5,Amazing Display of Allegiance,"Dimmu Borgir is a Symphonic Black Metal band halining from Norway. Their sound is amazing and can't be compared to any other sound, as with each new album they enhance their music in some way or another.This Belt Buckle is a great way to show how big of a fan you are, as it displays the Dimmu borgir signature upside-down Pentagram, and two phrases, ""in Satan we Trust"" and ""Do what Must be Done"".As Black Metal as they come, a definite buy!"
5,Johnson Collection,"Two hundred and Eighty-Eight Reproductions of Italian, Dutch, Flemish. German, Spanish, French, English and 19th Century Paintings...Cover reproduction: Jay Van Eyck's ""Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata""...Frontispiece: Pietro Lorenzetti's ""Virgin and Child Enthroned""And this item is AVAILABLE...2 copies are for sale here on Amazon"
5,Perry Ellis 360 EDT for Women,"Love this fragrance, nice, CLEAN, fresh, just got out of the shower smell. I get a lot of compliments with this one, and have used it for the last 5+ years. It smells even better when someone gives it to you as a gift!!!!:)"
4,ANOTHER WINNER FROM PERRY ELLIS,"For the clean, clear lines of the bottle ""360"" walked off with the Fragrance Foundation's Best packaging award.There should also be an award for the fragrance itself - it's a standout, crisp, sunny with a hint of Provence. A lush scent it boasts notes of lily, amber, and lavender.""360"" is available in parum, eau de toilette, and a complete body collection"
5,"Insightful, substantially challenges Bush's assertions","Insightful, substantially challenges Bush's assertions. On a number of central issues of President Bush based upon his statements and priorities, the author basically tears President Bush into shreds -- however in a polite manner."
5,The Best Bush Book Yet!,"A lot of people dismiss Bush as a corporate controlled politician. Peter Singer does not. He gives the president the benefit of the doubt, trusts him, and that makes his book much more engaging than other books scrutinizing Bush.The book reveals Bush's inconsistency and mistakes with more clarity and insight than any major newspaper or magazine, it holds Bush accountable for his failings in the economy, the the environment, Afghanistan, Iraq, and just about everything else.This book is essential for a real look at George W. Bush's presidency. John Kerry would do well to read it."
1,Straw men and circular reasoning,"I almost rated the book 2 stars, but only because reading the book gives insight into Singer's prejudices.Singer sets up his arguments and then uses ""might,"" ""seems,"" etc. in order to reach the conclusion with which he began.Singer has no understanding of Christianity, which is an obvious weakness in his arguments"
4,Great Read!,"Good twists, surprise ending, moved along at a good pace, able to get to know the characters.Fast read, didn't want to put it down, author excellent at imagery.Have ordered the next two books in the series."
5,The Poisoned Rose,"Hemingway would endorse this book. It reveals the complexities and darkness simmering beneath the surface of this small town through characters written with such depth and precision that you might recognize them as you pass on the sidewalk. Judson has managed to thread the literary needle by offering up a riveting story in spare, poetic prose that invites the reader into unexpected places. One of the best books I've ever read."
4,"Enjoyable, fast-paced...with an interesting lead","Enjoyable, fast-paced...with an interesting lead character. Lots of twists and turns that are credible enough to keep you hanging in. Suggest reading the trilogy in order."
4,A real good horror anime.,"This anime is really entertaining. I'm a fan of horror flicks, but there are not too many horror anime titles out there. This one is one of the better ones. It centers around Mai. Mai is a high school girl that joins a supernatural research team. Naru is the leader of this team. He's kind of a self deluded jerk, but he's the best supernatural investigator around. The team investigates all sorts of different phenomenon, and each story is pretty interesting and surprising.The animation and voice acting in this anime are very good. They really capture the creepiness of each investigation pretty well. I can't say anything bad about this title. It's a whole lot of fun. I'm only gonna give it 4 stars b/c there are a few horror animes out there that are better. Shiki is the best horror anime I've seen up to now. Everything about it blows other horror animes out of the water. Even so Ghost Hunt is really good and definitely worth watching."
5,Great!,"One of my favorite sets! Pretty good plots, great character development and episodes that keep you interested in what's going on. The episodes are broken into parts they all fit together very well. The heroine (Mai) does really good job sort of leading you into what's going on and she comes across as a really likeable character. All the persons and situations are well constructed and presented. I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting to watch a good anime series. Really Great!"
4,Riveting and Suspenseful!,"***Ending Spoilers at THE END of the review***I would have to say that this movie is work watching for those that appreciate ghost stories enough to sit through 26 episodes of them. This is a fun mystery case series that reminds me of Sherlock Holmes meets the Poltergeist. I think those that love a great mystery would enjoy the series. The characters are a bit cliche but they add their charm.okay,, ***spoiler***The reason for 4 stars is because the ending could not leave an audience feel more confused than what just happened. Naru suddenly has a power that allows him to shoot crazy poltergeists and ghosts that he doesn't demonstrate until the end of the episode and they never resolve why the lead girl receives these visions of Naru."
2,Stop half way through,"The concept of this movie got me intrigued: animated zombie film. But like other reviewers have overstated, it gets quite repetitive. Everything is done by the same guy, including voice acting, which is most notable when he tries to do a female character.My suggestion: Someone else take this amazing concept and do something truely amazing with it!My other suggestion: Watch only the first half! This would have been much better if it was much shorter!!"
2,City of Letdown,"I was VERY disappointed by this movie. I expected to see a good zombie flick. Instead I got preached at periodically throughout the movie. I didn't need a lecture; I needed a good Zombie movie. The animated zombies were cool, but it got a little boring because you could see he was killing the same zombies over and over. How many times was the same nurse in the movie? Then the plot kind of dies half way through the movie. It seemed like they only had half a script and improvised the rest. There were some great ideas, but this was a let down. I would watch it again, but I am afraid I would get more of the same."
3,im not sure yet !?,"Just finish watching this movie and i dont know yet if i like or not.I mean its a good idea to have a zombi cartoon but i dont know.1st thesoundtrack is too loud so you have a hard time to hear the dialogue.2ndthe cartoon are not that good.Im a big zombie fan and this movie was notenought for me.Just received bone sicknes too, i hope its better if not,off to the pound shop ill go !!"
5,"Excellent, subtle horror","The cover caught my attention, and so I bought it. I'm waiting for the next volume. There's Houdini's ghost, Helen Keller's, some WWII guys, all of them excellent and most of them with surprising, twists. My favorites were Jimmy Hoffa's ghost and Andre Norton's story."
4,Amazing detail,"Historical hauntings kept me up all night. I couldn't think about anything else until I was finished with the book. Vivid detail in every object. My only complaint is that it's waaaay too short. But other than that, highly reccomended."
2,Well sung and acted-TERRIBLE PRODUCTION!,"There is nothing to get in this production, it just stinks, period. All principals performed well with Hampson in the really extraordinary category - I do agree with another reviewer, ""he was Mac Beth""! The costumes were so awful that they were distracting throughout. I would have rather seen a concert version than a production this bad. Sorry, I won't be adding this to my collection in spite of the acceptable performances and Hampson's which was superb. The production managed to ruin a wonderful opera. How very, very sad."
1,"ghastly, not ghostly","Stop the Madness! Once again, Hampson's hubris knows no bounds. This portrayal, if you can call it that, displays Hampson at his most self-engrandizing. It borders on self-parody. The other ""critics"" who have reviewed this production clearly suffer from ""Hampsonitis"" -- the love of all things Thomas, even the undeniably horrible. You would be better off throwing your coins in the Trevi fountain than purchasing this ode to self-importance. Oh and by the way, Hampson sings brutally too."
5,Everything I Had Hoped,I always read the reviews posted before I make a purchase. So I am writing this to confirm the previous reviews stating what a fantastic movie this is. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Make the purchase! You'll not regret it!
5,Masterpiece!,"Cranford is fantastic, hilarious, and sentimental. Five hours sounds long but I swear it flies by; there are some scenes that will stay with me for the rest of my life. If you have a heart you will like Cranford."
4,Wonderful Character Acting,"Michael Gambon, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, Francesca Annis, and many others are a joy to watch and lose oneself in the storyline. The scenery and costumes are perfect. There are multiple love stories going on, and I appreciate Elizabeth Gaskell as a writer."
5,Totally Heartwarming,The Brits really know how to produce top-level entertainment. Cranford is magical and I was saddened when it finished. Wish there were more installments.
3,Hummmm... it was ok?,"I love BBC shows, mini series, and the alike. But I thought Cranford was going to be so much better than it actually was. Don't get me wrong it is good- except for the part Tim Curry enters- wtf? I'm sorry Tim Curry does not belong in period films. Good actor but stay out of period films! I guess it was just too serious for me. CLATTERFORD was a ga-gillion times better!!!! Cranford is good for a rainy day but if I had it to do over- I wouldn't have spent money on this one :("
3,"Great series, but...","Admittedly, a great series. On the other hand, I resent having to sit through fifteen minutes of BBC commercials to get to the program. I do not mind this being on the disc, as a matter of fact, I like it there but I would like to access it at my and not the BBC's leisure. If I wanted to watch commercial TV I would do so."
1,"Couldn't Make It Through The 2nd Disc,Just Didn't Interest Me At All!","Maybe if I had watched Cranford,before the exquisite Lark Rise To Candleford I would have liked it more.I have watched the first 3 seasons of LRTC and when I finished disc 5 of season 3 I made the mistake of putting Cranford into my DVD player.I only managed to watch the first disc,because I did not find the characters nor the story interesting nor engaging.I'm sorry but it bored me to yawning!"
5,Cranford,Steep in tradition and set in a world set apart. these people are all of a sudden facing changes that seem for them to be unrealand at times frightening.
5,entertaining,"My husband and I absolutely loved Cranford.The costuming was magnificent.The characters came alive. We laughed ,we cried and the ending was very satisfying."
5,Wonderful!,This series is very endearing! There are some surprises and several character stories going on at once. All the actors are very good in this. It is so like the time period and I found it very humorous! Quite a joy for my husband and I both to watch!
5,Judi Dench! Wows me again!,"I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely it is followed, but I loved this 2 DVD series. The characters draw you into their 19th Century lives. The absence of eligible men in the town of Cranford is the underlying cause of the story. The most heart wrenching scenes involve misunderstandings and class distinction-which I suppose is still prevalent in Britain today. Judi Dench is superb and I enjoyed seeing so many of the actors I have come to love from other BBC series."
5,Cranford by Francesca Annis,"I love period productions. Cranford will always be on my shelf to view again and again. Each time I watch it I become more closely involved in the lives of those who live in Cranford. It is not only entertaining but educational as well. No typical Hollywood hipe here, thank goodness."
5,"Very real, classic entertainment..","This is the type of classic entertainment a person can sit and get absorbed in, and also as background , as you do other things around the house, it keeps your interest.."
2,What a dissapointment,"Just loved this story. However, this DVD collection is severely edited from the original BBC production, leaving it shorter and harder to follow. WTF? Why did the BBC need to cut so much out?Sorry I bought these and am hoping the full version will come out soon."
3,"Looks great in the beginning, but shows wear after only one year","The faucet looked great in the beginning. It was a good price compared to the big box stores. However, it has now been a little less than a year and the handle has ""wear"" marks that will likely lead to me replacing this. The bathroom is only being used by one person, so not a ""high traffic"" area. I would probably go with a higher quality product next time after these results."
3,Keep the pages in proper order !,"The history is excellent but the reading is difficult due to some pages not being in sequential order. Once you get the hang as to where the story continues, you're fine but it is frustrating. The photos are super some of which I have not seen before. Histoically sound. However, I did notice an error or two but certain they were clerical in nature. Overall a good buy for a Ford Nut."
4,smooth guitar at it's best,"I first heard the first track ""Just Us"" on the radio on became an instant fan. Whether fast or slow, every tune has a great groove and melodic flow. Check out the list of guest artist, Bob James, Nelson Rangell, John Patitucci, Will Lee, Andy Snitzer, David Samuels, etc... This one should be in your collection."
1,Smooth jazz ain't jazz.,"If you're thinking about buying this album because you heard him play with Ornette Coleman, DON'T --> I truly cannot understand how anyone who played with a true musical genious at the calliber of Coleman (and sounded pretty damn good, by the way) could sink so low. I bought this album (not from Amazon.com or I'd have heard the clips) and I was shocked. Despite the despite the stupid cover, I expected good music. If you want to hear a great JAZZ guitar player, check out Pat Metheney, 'cause if you think this is jazz, or even music (muzak more aptly) than maybe you'd better take another shot of morphine."
2,Sold themselves out...,"It took many years, many albums, and a few different record labels but Slick Shoes have finally abandoned their beliefs and fans for the mainstream media. Their sound has been progressively heading towards a formulaic pop/punk sound and now the transformation is complete. They have changed their music from emotional and meaningful with incredible metal like solos' and compelling lyrics to a copycat sound. To appeal to mass amounts of people they have also abandoned their faith, or at least Ryan has. He even wrote a song about it, which led to a member of the band to actually quit. Of course it was under the guise of 'creative differences.' The music is uninspired and boring (listen to Burn Out and Rusty for the good times) and their abandonment of their fans and faith make me want to puke. They've lost another fan who has listened to them since Ryan was 13. Good luck with the MTV crowd guys.-GuyintheTV'All judgements are final'"
4,What an amazing band! Are they MxPx???,"I really love this band. I have only heard them for the first time today and i already love em'! However they sound excactly like the other us pop-punk band MxPx!! MxPx is like my favorite band and i even have a spike boy tattoo and when i heard this band i could not believe how much they sounded alike! the resemblence in the vocals are amazing! This is one of those albums that you could listen to over and over again like ""say it like you mean it"" by the starting line."
3,Not what I was looking for.,I was looking for a medical grow starter book. Not at all like that. More of the history of researching the plant and studies.
1,dissapointed,I am most dissapointed with my purchase. The cards should be sold in conjuction with the book.
2,"Beautiful, but.........","The dolphin pictures are beautiful, but they are smaller than the palm of your hand and they look like paper pogs. When you touch the poglike dolphin chips you can feel the energy that it sets off. You will need to order the book in order to find the interpretation of the dolphin cards."
5,Lovin The Dolphins.......,Easy to use and wonderful contents on each and every dolphin card .....The dolphin love & Joy is eloquently expressed. Would recommend !!!!!
3,Material could be a little more supple,"This was some of the only 2 1/2"" cove base that I could find. It worked ok, but the material was extremely stiff. It would have been easier to use if it were a little more flexible and supple. The adhesive is very sticky and so far it has stayed put very well. Corners were a little difficult due to the stiffness."
1,sucks,"The tape sucks, don't even self stick as show. It is not flat, but has a ridge at the bottom of the tape,"
5,Great production!,"New to Hefner, I picked up this CD and have been playing it daily ever since. A nice balance of vocal and instrumental tracks with outstanding production throughout, this album is for anyone who likes LHOOQ, Hooverphonic, Thievery Corp., and SOMA Sonic."
1,Disappointed,"I had high hopes, but this collection is very bad. Poor quality video. Many segments not complete. Does not seem to have had anyone at the helm during production as segments appear lumped together in illogical fashion. I thought something with the Reader's Digest name would be of a certain level of quality. Not so here. Stay away from this one."
2,crystal salt lamp bowl from Gaiam,"This was a gift for someone and it was a disappointment to them becauseit doesn't really heat up, it just gets a little warm.It has massage balls that are supposed to heat so there would be a warm massage benefit and that doesn't happen. The crystals don't heat up so there is no benefit to the air from them either. This should be a better product for the price."
2,"Silly and dumb, but kinda fun","Bad special effects, a shark with two heads which both manage to roar while underwater, poor acting, dumb dialogue and delivery of it, and more! All very silly but worth a cheap rental just to make fun of it."
1,Very poor effort,I'm a big fan of creature features but this one just plain stunk. Most of the things the characters did in the film didn't make any sense and it seemed as if they were just making it up as they went along unscripted.The shark would show up occasionally to liven it up but not enough to keep interest.Carmen electra's character was ridiculous and she spent her time primping and mugging for the camera to look 'sexy'.I think they told her she was the star of the film or something but she was rarely involved.The rest of the cast never rose above typical victim-of-the-quarter hour status.This was more like one of the new National Lampoon films than a creature feature.
4,Was it supposed to be that funny?,"I have to see anything that has Shark in the title so I couldn't wait for this one. It was surprisingly enjoyable. I don't usually laugh during horror movies but I giggled throughout this ridiculous thing. The acting is truly horrible, like 1st grade play awful. The shark changes size throughout the movie. First it's the size of a speed boat or even bigger then it sneaks up on some boobs in 3 feet of water!If you're into cheesy movies and don't mind nudity then you have to rent this."
3,"A Poor Man's ""Piranha""","2 Headed Shark Attack is a creature feature that is obviously trying to cash in on the minor success of Piranha 3D. And it's not a bad movie, but it lack the bloody shock value of Piranha. There is gore, but it's not over the top. If you like Sy-Fy original movies, you should check it out though, as it's better than a lot of the movies shown on the Sy-Fy Channel. And it's got Carmen Electra looking 20-something at 39."
2,OMG DONT !!!!!!!!!!!!,FIRST OFF I LOVE BROOKE HOGAN...BUT MY DAUGHTER IS IN LOVE WITH SHARK MOVIES SOO I WAS LIKE WE HAVE TO GET THIS FOR HER... SHE IS 5 AND EVEN SHE HATED IT .. I HAVE TO SAY THE BOOBS IN THIS MOVIE AND THE GRLS KISSING WAS A LIL TOO MUCH FOR MY KID BUT ALL IN ALL SHE LOVED THE SHARK BUT THAT WAS IT THE MOVIE IN SOME SCENES HAD CARTOONISH QUALITY. I LOVE THE FACT THAT BROOKE HOGAN LOOKS BORED THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE AND ALOT BITCHY..LOL.. IM GLAD SHE DIDNT DIE BUT PLEASE DONT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS MOVIE OR EVEN YOURSELF... IT TOOK 2 HOURS OUT OF MY LIFE...
3,Meh,"Pros:- Cute girls- Boobs- beautiful beach scenery- stupid people getting pwned by a sharkcons:- bad acting- completely unrealistic death scenes (eg. a part where the water is obviously 2.5-3 feet deep but then shows the shark under the water in which the shark is at least 5 feet high)- stupid people- cheesy plot- an ending that makes you go ""wtf?""Overall, there's far more cons than pro's. But if you want an enjoyable movie experience, and this is what you want to watch,make sure you're with a few close friends and have lots of booze available."
2,TWO STARS -- ONE FOR EACH HEAD,"There are good cheesy movies that are so bad, they're fun to watch and then there are cheesy movies that are just bad. 2-HEADED SHARK ATTACK falls in-between.Carmen Electra as a doctor? Charlie O'Connell as a marine biologist? Yeah, totally believable---LOL.We have a slew of college students with huge boobs or six-pack abs stranded on an atoll stalked by the hilarious two-headed shark. The cast is awful; the effects are terrible; and the direction uninspired and inept. The Asylum boasts a catalogue of 100 films, most of them easily forgettable.There are a few laughs and the ladies are some of the worst screamers committed to celluloid. Rent don't buy!!"
3,A tad boring frankly,I was disappointed with this film. I love the Greeks and their achievements. The film has a slow narration by Pierce Brosnan and visual effects which reminded me of the Jason and the Argonauts I saw wen I was a kid 30+ years ago. I did like the piece on the lighthouse.
4,Great Book,"Nice addition to any chess players library. Good interviews with many famous chess players. Easy read. No chess examples, problems. Only interviews. Excellent condition, like new.Thank You"
1,The Snakes Son Raps,I know why there were no sound bites for this turkey.Most people who buy this expect Harvey Mandels guitar. What you get is his son rapping and not real good about dope guns etc.While Harvey was playing blues in the ghetto in the 60s I doubt if his son has hung out alot in the hood.The raps are so typical you know what words hes gonna rhyme.Its so sorry it could be a parody of ghetto rap.Maybe it is Harvey has a sense of humor. Harvey plays a little smokin guitar in the background not anything worth buyin this sorry cd for.
1,For the Harvey Mandel completist only.,"If you are a Harvey Mandel fan, you're safe getting just about everything he's done, except for this cd. Completists, save this one for last."
3,"""Tha Westside"" Review","Going back to the 90's when West Coast rap music ran the airwaves, ""Tha Westside"" takes a look at the days when Death Row and Ruthless were the hottest labels around. Covering many of the major events and turmoils during the rise of the West in the rap game, this movie doesn't have any actual interviews with the stars that it is discussing but it does have commentary from several of their peers as well as never-before-seen video footage of them. With an intro from DJ Quik and words from artists like Crooked I, Kokane, and Tupac's bro, Mopreme, there are a few noticeable names involved with this project. All in all, it's not quite up to par with the much longer and more detailed ""Welcome To Death Row"" documentary though if you liked that, you will probably find some worth in this DVD."
3,Were the G's at?,"Look i am the biggest fan of gangsta rap and have all the best rap DVDs out there....(and this is probably the worst)There is not one interview with the real rappers! There is about 15min worth the money the rest just bores you!The only rapper that you might know that they interview is kokaine and that is it.......There is though - about 15mins - of good live footage of tupac rapin outside his car rollin up a joint......Plus you see some footage of Dre on the piano with the dogg pound and Snoop!There are 10s of DVDs you should buy first, but if you really like Pac, add this to your collection!PEACE YOU'll"
2,Gardner just doesn't know how to write Bond!,"Ok. This was the first James Bond book I ever read. I thought it was pretty good, until I read some of the titles by Ian Fleming and Raymond Benson. I realized that both Fleming and Benson are both great and Gardner doesn't really have a clue. I reccomend Anything by Benson, everything he writes is great. That's all for now."
1,Horrid,"I've been a big James Bond fan for years and have read and re-read all the Ian Fleming and Kingsley Amis novels a number of times. Gardner's novels I've read exactly one time each and have never had a desire to pick any one of them up again.This one, however, was so bad that I couldn't even finish a first reading. It got so tedious that after finishing less than one-third of the book I had to set it down. That was several years ago, and I haven't had any desire to pick it up again since.It really is too bad that this had to happen because John Gardner really is a good novelist when he puts his heart into it. Sadly, though, his heart was never really with the Bond character. What's even worse for fans of the true Ian Fleming Bond, however, is the fact that the publisher passed the torch to the truly horrid Raymond Benson. Benson's cartoon Bond is lifted straight from the movie screen and makes even Gardner's most mediocre books (like this one) seem like works of genius."
2,"By far, John Gardner's worst","Cold Fall's plot isn't terrible, but John Gardnerdid a shoddy job of writing. There were a bunch of discrepancies that a diehard Bond fanatic would notice. Bond's character did a few things he has never done before, like ordering beer instead of a martini. Like loving two women he had sex with. Like not being the hero because he called in ""the cavalry"" at the end of the book.Gardner is past his prime. Many of his Bond books have been enjoyable, but Cold Fall signals the demise of John Gardner. I can only hope it doesn't signal the demise of James Bond."
1,Unreadable,"Ian Fleming must be rolling over in his grave. John Gardner's early efforts to resurrect the Bond character were respectable, but he peaked with the outstanding *Icebreaker* and has been doing nothing more than going through the motions ever since. This book was thoughtlessly thrown together for no reason other than to fulfill a contract obligation. It's an embarrasment to the series, the publisher, and to Gardner's literary career."
3,Classic Alice lineup with a few covers,"1. Ain't That Just Like a Woman (B.B. King), 2. Painting a Picture, 3. Medley: A.C. Instrumental - I've Written Home to Mother, 4. Freak Out Song, 5. Goin' to the River (Fats Domino), 6. Nobody Likes Me (Listed as ""Nobody Like Me""), 7. Science Fiction."
3,"""Freak Out""","This is yet another rehashing of the 1968 Toronto Rock 'N' Roll Revival this is only of interest to completist. This album has also been called ""Freak Out"", ""Live In Toronto"", ""Snorting Anthrax"", ""Nobody Likes Me"", etc..Save your money kids this is not endorsed by Alice or anyone else."
2,This is not Orkney,"How this book won any awards is a mystery to me... No attempt has been made to use the Islanders' distinctive accents and surnames. The descriptions within the book do not reflect Orkney's unique landscape and leave the reader with a view of the island as filled with paper thin characters and carboard cut-out landscapes. Additionally, the so-called 'heritage' which is mentioned throughout the book seems to be a diluted version of Scotland's with a few pieces of Norse mythology thrown in for good measure. In short, if you are interested in the islands do not read this book - come visit Orkney instead."
5,Love it!,"I used this tape back in college. My brother used it in his Frat too, all the guys would be lined up 'holding a tray of raw vegetables' I used it for about six years and then it died on me (it is a VHS) I NEVER found anything that worked as good as this tape - It is incredibly dated with the music and clothes but whatever the combination is that she uses it is the most effective tape ever, I was so happy to get this tape again. I am really scared that it is going to get all eaten up too eventually but if you are thinking about buying this it is AMAZING! 15 min a day, sooooo worth it!"
5,Awesome!!,"Joanie Greggain's Super Stomachs is Awesome! There is no other way to put it. I used this after having my children 20 years ago, and got my shape back. Now that I am in my late 40's my body started to change. I purchased another copy and started working out with it again. My body is almost back where it should be, just need a little more time and I will be back to normal. I just wish it was in DVD. Just saw ""Ultimate Abs"" and that is my next purchase, just for the new technology. Thanks Joanie for keeping my body in shape all these years!"
2,*sigh*,"I truly expected this soundtrack to display much, much more of the Massive ""sound"" than it has. Deep into the disc, I found myself feeling very bored and disappointed that I was lured into buying this soundtrack because it read ""Massive Attack"" on the jacket. MA, this is not.While certainly without the well-known name on the front, it would have been a relative success. In actuality, it's not a bad soundtrack, it's just that I expected more. Fans of MA should understand how highly they've raised the bar over the years and to hear ""Danny the Dog"" is quite a let down.Maybe the lack, for the most part, of vocals is a key downer. Maybe the absence of a driving rhythm or beat is the problem. Maybe it's a little of everything...or maybe it's the fact that it's a soundtrack, music made to fit a movie and it's not going to be as cohesive as an actual studio release.In any case, this disc is pretty much only for MA collectors."
1,short and simple,"This is about a half a newspaper column, 1000 words total, including all the references, and has very solid recommendations, so solid you are quite sure you've heard them all before.Don't click the button to buy."
1,as boring as the self-titled release,"What a pain this album is to listen to; it has the most uninteresting chord progressions I've ever heard and a whiny singer. It's soft and creative with use of instruments, but the instruments are not used to make good music unfortunately. This band pretty much can stop making tunes for all I care, because hardly anyone in the U.S. knows who they are. Don't buy this crap unless you want to substitute it for Lunesta."
2,not enough to crack you up to be..,"Not your average daily-dose of humor, and aside from being an amusing gift, I don't recommend this calendar even/especially to diehard Dilbert fanatics."
2,Beware!,"This is represented as a 3"" diameter rosette, but is not. Very responsible seller, nevertheless. Accepts returns from buyers who have old knobs that need to go on new doors with pre-drilled holes. This item will NOT work for that application."
5,Excellent Replacement Part!!,"After several ""run-arounds"" with aftermarket O2 sensors (even Bosch!) and about a month of an intermittent Check Engine light, I finally purchased this AC Delco sensor and cured my problem! I simply used the part # stamped on the old sensor, matched it up here and got an Original GM Replacement part. It's been well over 6 months, and NO Check Engine light! Plus, it was cheaper than the aftermarket sensors! Always use OEM sensors!"
5,Another great book in this series,"I can't speak highly enough of the ""Let's Read and Find Out Series."" My two and four year old boys love to read them. Just enough info to be interesting and instructive for two, three and four year olds."
5,"if a 12 yr old can understand this book, why can't you?","Ok. I thought this book was really good. My teacher recommended it to me as a ""good book for writers."" You need to grasp his style of writing and think about it a bit. It's not one of those books that you can just read through. For all of y'all who thought it was confusing; maybe you should have took the time to think about it and digest it. Overall, this book is great but you need to get used to it. It was unlike any book I've ever read before."
2,important notice: don't waste time on this!,"I really hated it. I heard a lot of good things about it and I was waiting to read something that would make this book somewhat climactic. This book is hard to understand because almost nothing is direct, its very symbolic and at every little scene you gotta think,"" Why is he writing this?"""
1,poor work at best,This book is one of the most skewed stories that I have ever read. Vonnegut is a talented author but this book does not come close to showing his talents. Don't waste your money or your time.
2,Slaughter House Five,"I thought SHF was a very detailed book, and I thought it was a little intense and grose. I think he needed to slow it down a little bit."
1,don't waste your money,i thought that this book was a very hard to understand and jumped around a lot. as far as i'm concerned it should be burned.
1,What a awful book!,"This is the most confusing book i have ever read in my life. The book jumped around so much you can never find what his true feelings about Dresden are. I read this book for school and now acknowledge i wasted a lot of time reading it. If you are looking for a boring, unintresting look at World War 2, this is the book for you!"
2,slaughter this book,"this book was very boring. vonnegut had billy, the main character, jumping around different scenes in the story. it was a very confusing book to read."
1,The WORST book I have ever read!,"This book was AWFUL! I wouldn't even give this book even ONE star! This book did not make any sense! I was reading it with an open mind, and I still didn't understand it! If your thinking about reading this forget about it! You would do better to read something else, maybe a Harry Potter book. I can't believe I even wasted my time reading this!"
2,Lifeless phone,"Bought this phone a few years ago. Thought it had a lot of nice features. Soon found out, it's not all it cracked up to be.PRO: Loud ring, speaker phone base, good enough tones to choose from.CON: Short battery life! After days of charging, after talking 1 hour, it needs to be charged again. Even after changing out the battery.NOW: Phone won't even charge. It's on, the base works, but not the phone. Never buying a V-Tech again."
4,Nice phone but overpriced,"We had problems with the first delivery of this order - the numeric keypad on the main cordless phone would not work properly. Amazon immediately replaced the order, but the new order that came had a set of bad batteries that did not get charged at all. In the end, when we had the right parts, the phone worked fine and is in good shape now. The handset is a bit bigger than I would like it to be, and the phone seems overpriced at $90. But it works well and has good voice quality."
3,NO Guide to Pronouncing Spanish Words!!,"As other reviewers have stated, this dictionary is quite comprehensive, and for that, it's well worth buying. It has a great section on the alphabet, pronounciations, and grammar. However, the English part of the dictionary shows how to pronounce each entry word, BUT THE SPANISH DICTIONARY DOES NOT!! This was something I was looking for, and I found it in NTC's Easy Spanish English Dictionary (sold by Amazon) and between them, they are great resources for learning Spanish.I also recommend the Spanish-English, English-Spanish Dictionary by Carlos Castillo and Otto F. Bond (sold by Amazon). The 3rd edition has cultural notes that later editions omit, and the hardcover is great because the paperback has tiny text.I would have given The American Heritage Spanish Dictionary, Second Edition 5 stars if it had the pronounciations for Spanish entry words."
4,"fairly good spanish dictionary, very affordable","i bought this dictionary for my advanced spanish grammar class at college, and it was a good buy. it's not too large or too heavy, and comes with up-to-date definitions and references for various modern things. in all honesty, i bought this dictionary as a replacement when my original was stolen... the oxford collegiate dictionary with CD-ROM is far superior for advanced collegiate level courses, but if you're an intermediate or high school student that doesn't intend to use spanish as intensely, the american heritage dictionary will do nicely."
4,AMAZING,JON LUCIEN HAS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING VOICES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. THIS CD IS ONE OF HIS BEST......IF YOU ARE A JON LUCIEN FAN YOU MUST HAVE THIS..........AMAZINGGREG LASSITERwww.misguidedproduction.com
4,Great introduction to various wildlife,"The content of this DVD set is excellent. Great filming and naration especially 'Untamed Africa'.Its a pity the full 13 part series of 'Untamed Africa' is not available on DVD to my knowledge. The picture quality of some of the DVDs could be better, but it is still good and enjoyable."
2,Promise unfulfilled,"An interesting, but not too funny type of comedy. To commit viewing this flick from start to finish, is a challenge"
5,replacement,"great to know these are available, I recently did a catering job and lost a lid to one of my fuel holders, was happy to buy a couple complete fuel holders and lids for spares."
4,Rated #1 by Gourmet - I agree!,"This oven mitt is the best, as long as you don't have small hands. I have medium to large hands, and it fits perfectly. I could imagine it might be bulky if you hands are smaller, but htat might not be a problem too. it covers your whole arm, is flexible, and it holds off the heat really well. i had a great grip on pots and dishes, which suprised me since there isn't a rubber grip or anything. I highly recommend this product."
2,you will literally get burned if you buy these oven mitts,"i thought i did enough research to ensure i was getting a decent product, but these oven mitts are a complete waste of money. forget handling any baking dish or cast iron that's been in the oven at 400 degrees or more. for the same money, go out and buy yourself a new pair of cheap oven mits once a month for the next year and you'll spend the same amount of money, get the same amount of protection, and actually have some nice clean mitts and burn free hands. so disappointing...and to make matters worse I bought 2 of them. don't be fooled too."
2,Disappointing,"The heat protection provided by these mitts is not any better than that of less expensive ones. Barely adequate, and not worth the cost."
2,just too big for a small hand,I should have heeded the warnings that this was not for small hands but i thought who has an oven mitt that fits? --- all of them seem to be big so I bought it anyway as my hands aren't that small. Sadly i am returning it as it is so large that when i bend my hand to grasp a pot or pan my hand bends inside the mitt but the mitt still sticks straight out. You can concentrate on grasping the inside of the mitt when you grasp something but you have to really concentrate on using it and for the price i just thought it should be easier to use. Otherwise it appears well made.
2,Not all that,The material behaves as advertised regarding it's insulation properties. I have medium sized hands for a man but the thumb socket's a bit tite so when I pull it off the lining slips out with my thumb. I end up using a towel
3,Thomas JEfferson and the AMerican Ideal,"This book was excellant for a report I did on Jefferson. It is a pretty simple biography, easy to read. It gives basic information on Jefferson, but is not extremely in depth. Still,it was informative and worth reading."
5,From a Student's Perspective,"I am currently a student of Dr. Garth Rosell (the editor), and he begins each class period with a story from this book. Not only does it help us to ease into another day's studies, but it also reminds us to keep the right perspective on our lives. I absolutely adore these stories -- the archaic language used in the book actually adds a sense of grandeur to the otherwise simple tales, and has charmed me from the first sentence. I would highly recommend this book for pastors, teachers, and anyone who needs a short, lively pick-me-up during the day."
4,This book is an excellent collection of short stories.,"Since the first time I heard Barton's Modern day parables I have liked the amusing and inciteful way that he uses common occurences to illustrate scriptural truth. I am so glad that someone was able to find and get these stories republished. They are excellent for devotions, illustrations or just casual reading. They are also ideal for a waiting room or as a gift. If any other stories by William E. Barton became available I would be interested in getting them as well."
1,missing information,"In this set it does not contain any information on Dick York even though this is his last season on the series as Darrin. However, they did put in an informercial in Spainish before each show on the later disc's with no english translation at all.A little back ground on Dick Yorks years as Darrin would have been a great bonus but alas not to be."
1,Don't buy from this vendor!,"I ordered a CD from this vendor but never received the product. I was told it could take up to a month to receive so I waited patiently but the product never arrived, nor did an explaination, even after submitting a complaint."
5,"Bewitched, the Complete Fifth Season","Item just as described. Packaged great, delivered on time. No hesitation in doing business with this guy."
5,Bewitched,Bewitched - The Complete Fifth SeasonLove the Bewitched Series! Can't wait for Season six to come out!
5,My Wife loves Bewitched,I bought this item for my Wife for her birthday she see seems to enjoy it very much.Do not know much about Bewitched I am more of a COMBAT ! guy.
3,Hoyle Card Games 2003,"I am satisfied with most games except for Bridge, the main reason I made the purchase. The players take far too long to respond and even longer to play their cards. It is so bad that I never even play bridge!In hearts, the players make inappropriate comments when playing the queen of spades.In gin rummy, you don't get a good look at the cards when the game is over.Overall, the older versions are better for both the games and the characters. I look forward to reviews for the 2004 version to see if there is any improvement before I think of buying it!"
2,Buy older versions,"This version is a complete letdown from the last version, Hoyle card games 5 (or 2002).You're granted a wealth of new possibilities for the facemaker, but you lose much ability to control and save your newly made face.Additionally, while I am glad to see Gax and Ethel go, the new characters are generally dreadful! Their names are terrible, their sentences are terrible. And Elayne's new hair don't. Oi.This game does have some improvements: You are now allowed to reshuffle discards in crazy 8's, and you may now play Omnibus (jack of diamonds) hearts. But, those game upgrades are the only reason I gave it 2 stars.You'd be best off to stick to the versions that came out in the last couple of years before this one. Maybe the new one coming out will be better. But don't count on it."
2,Mac users watch out,"As a Mac user, I was very disappointed to find out that these games are not native under MacOS X. It'll be two years in March that OSX was released, and the folks doing Mac development for Hoyle are way behind the curve. It's not going to be sufficient to keep cranking out slightly different Hoyle games each year so long as OSX support is missing.All that aside, the net play is misleading, to say the least. The games in the package do not allow for net play. Rather, it launches a website that has a selection of games, some very different from those in this set. Furthermore, small print on the back of the box again adds disappointment for Mac users - the web site does not allow Mac users to play."
2,Bridge,"Like another reviewer. I found that this game needs a lot of work. While playing the game is fun, the biggest problem is that the partner fails to bid with good cards, bids with bad ones, and does not follow the conventions provided in the game's help package! This game should be revised as an offering by itself, I would be prepared to pay more, if it simulated correct bidding. With Vb.Net and the collection objects, programmuing this game should be much simpler than in the past."
1,Beware Mac Users,This game (and others dated before about 2007) will not load on the Mac OS-X current platform. It's not worth returning since shipping is not included. Amazon should note this compatibility issue in their description.
4,Great fun!,"Although this version still has some bugs (in Canasta it allows players to open with the number of wild cards equal to or more than the natural cards) it still is a blast to play! Just pretend that the ""table"" rules are different when you play and you'll be just fine. I hope I can remember when I'm playing real people. I especially like the ""revenge"" button! I like this so much, I'm buying another for a friend for Christmas."
1,Don't waste your money,"Nice graphics, and clear audio. But, many of the games are poorly programed. In the case of hearts, I doubt the programmer had ever played a game before he programmed this joke. The computer plays very similar to the hearts game built into windows (poorly) The characters make comments, but half the time they are inappropriate. Like gloating when they're losing, and complaining when they're winning. Over the years, I've never had a Hoyle game that really ""got it right."" This is no exception, and is the last one I'll buy."
1,Bad Software,"Couldn't get to load on my XP-Pro System. Crashed my computer every time I tried something to get it to load. When I called the number for tech support, I was told that the free tech support expired and I'd have to pay for help. NEVERMIND! I returned software for refund."
3,Play away!,"After starting up the program, you'll see a ring of card games from which to choose -- including a few you're probably not familiar with. Hoyle does a good job at teaching you the basics so you can play even the more advanced ones with little startup time.Solitaire games are a dime a dozen, but the clear cards and speed makes for a nice gaming experience -- even though you could have done the same thing by pulling out a deck. Hoyle is more interesting when you have opponents to play against, but if you want games like poker or blackjack, you'll have to buy Hoyle Casino (the flagship of the Hoyle series).It's certainly likable and well done, but your own interest will depend on how many new card games you can learn."
1,Card games are very bad,"Solitaire is not fun at all, I play solitair for relaxiation, and hoyle's solitaire is like playing in a championship. I feel that I upgraded from the 2001 version to the 2003 for nothing. I cannot recommend this card game disk."
3,An above average New Age CD,"This is an ok cd as far as New Age music goes. You can hear the influences of the New Age greats like Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze and Vangelis. But Paul puts enough of his own inprint on it to make it interesting.If you're a fan of spacey New Age then this may be a disc you should listen to."
1,You may want to think twice about buying this disc.,"I bought this CD as a recommendation from the Echoes web site. Three of the other discs they suggested were very good but not this one. It has a discordant, chaotic sound and can hardly be called music. What I expected to be relaxing is instead irritating. I typically like the rhythmic, ambient styles of music but ""Into the Liquid Unknown"" is a disappointment."
3,Disappointing by Eiht's standards,"MC Eiht's worst solo album out of his 13 solo's to date (8/05) I have all of them. Has no real great songs and the production is a little weak (done by Eiht & Poetic 1). Has a bonus dvd but it's nothing special either just Eiht talking while smokin a blunt & getting his hair braided and Eiht in the studio. One song features Spice 1 and is the best one on here. It has 4 good songs and the rest are ok. If you're a huge Eiht fan get it but other than that I wouldn't recommend it, definitely cop one of his other ones - his best 3 are ""Section 8"", ""Death Threatz"", and ""Tha8t'z Gangsta"".#2 - 8#3 - 8#4 - 7#5 - 6.5#6 - 7#7 - 7.5#8 - 8.5#9 - 9(f/ Spice 1 - best one on here)#10 - 7#11 - 7#12 - 7Aaron Tyler -- Compton, CA -- b. around 1971COMPTON!!!check all my reviews"
1,what happened,"All of these west coast rappers such as mc eiht, spice 1, e-40 have put out great work..........to bad it was all in the mid 90's now a days these guys are whack I bought this mc eiht cd and was hoping he would get back to his roots like his classic we come strapped"" BUt my god what the hell is wrong with him every song on this cd sucks................west coast rap is dead........I guess I will have to go out and by little jon........even though I hate this new age rap its better listening to than these has beens trying to put out music......."
3,another banger,"This album was cool...classic eiht style.Track 5 and the track with spice were classic, mello out compton realness....the rest of the album was nice and very listenable. It had the same formula that has made eiht my favorite. Hardcore, soul wrenching lyrics with nice subliminal gangsta undertones in the beats.I only gave it a three cuz to me it was not as good as Tha8tz Gangsta.I am still funkin on that one.Compton 4 Death...jeah!"
5,Great Shoe,"I have twins with Autism. They both have flat, fat feet. They have always required shoes with good arch support (normally must be Stride Rite), and this shoe fits the bill. Great, stylish shoe. They both love them."
3,"BABES, EXPLOSIONS AND MORE BABES","Sidaris movies are typical: women, corny plots and action. ShaeMarks-Tiger and Carrie Westcott-Sofia are two of the most beautifulwomen on earth. This movie has everything gorgeous women, buff guys for the ladies, action, explosions. What ever your interest this movie has it!"
5,Buff Bagwell was so hot!,"I liked this movie because Buff Bagwell was in it. He was SO GORGEOUS. I only liked that movie because he was in it. I don't care how bad of acting it had in it, I loved it cause of him. So if you love Buff then you should see this."
4,buff + random nudity + random explosions = money!,"Buff Bagwell truly is the stuff. He gives the most awesome performance I have ever witnessed. As though Buff's comedic (not intentionally) presence is not enough, there is random nudity, and explosions that are even more random than the nudity. This is the movie that every college student dreams about making. Two thumbs up."
4,Decent 'Return',"Return To Savage Beach is one of the most distracting movies I've ever seen. Actually, a lot of Sidaris' movies are distracting. You can't focus on the plot, when you have beautiful people in beautiful locales driving beautiful cars. I have no idea what this movie was about, but whenever you have women as beautiful as Julie Strain, Julie K. Smith, and Shae Marks onscreen, who cares what the movie is about. You still get some enjoyment out of it. Julie Strain is awesome in this, as she was in most everything she has ever appeared in. There aren't any women working in movies today who are as badass as she was. Sadly, she has retired. I also loved the ninjas in this movie. Yeah, there is some good action to go along with the hot babes and dudes!"
1,DOESN'T DELIVER,"Even by Sidaris movie standards, this film is largely lame. Avoid this one if you can. The storyline is awful and the nude scenes are lukewarm at best. The whole thing really drags. This entry is probably the worst in the series. This series has evolved from the early days with '80s Playmates in the starring roles. The main difference is that the breasts are ALL fake now. If you want a good Sidaris movie check out ""Do or Die"" (1991),or a more recent entry ""The Dallas Connection."" These films have much better stories and the nude scenes are far more satisfying. Also, Strain and Smith look a lot better in 'Dallas'."
5,Thesis,"This book,One Sunny Day, is my favorite book in the whole world. It has everything I would want in a gothic thriller. Everything is blended in perfect. This book is the best. ..."
3,"nice, but overpriced","Don't be fooled. This is NOT the giant chess set that came in a wooden box and was difficult to find last year at Lego stores. That sold for about $200 retail. This is a much smaller set that consists of a simple chess ""board"" and 32 normal lego figures dressed up in knight costumes (which are already put together by the way). It's pretty unique but you can probably get it for a lot less than what they're selling it for here. I was fooled thinking I was getting the much bigger set. Buyer beware of course."
5,excellent,i heard this item over a friends house and had to have it. i am so glad i found it on your website.
2,Strickly for historians,"Lots of history here but at the expense of a good story. I wish it had been a biography of Tinkler, allowing us to infer more about Shanghai and the British Empire at that time rather than inundating us with masses facts. Well, maybe it got better as it went along, but I quite half way through."
1,You never know what you'll get I guess,I ordered this item but the platter I received has a completely different flower pattern in blue! I really wanted the item pictured so I'm not too happy...
4,Solid Reference,"Thrall's book is the standard reference for veterinary radiology. This book is extremely comprehensive and accurate, although perhaps not as detailed as some of those that focus on specific areas of radiology and radiographoc interpretation. I find it extremely useful and easy to find information."
1,wrong item,"I ordered the deluxe food processor and got the 3-cup in error. I have not used this product and am still awaiting a response from Amazon about a credit back to my card. I think the 3-cup was $20.00, and I paid 30.00 for the deluxe."
1,sonic vomit,"This must be the most talentless bunch ever to get a record deal.... and that means something with the likes of Lil Bow Wow around. This is total, utter junk. Don't bother buying this.. and with some luck we will never hear of this sad affair again."
3,back to the galleria,"FannyPack is what happens when you take Gravy Train!!!! and make it radio-friendly. There's nothing wrong with that, really. But FannyPack is the New Wave to Gravy Train!!!!'s Punk Rock. Catchier, glossier, more attitude and less emotion. Still, this is a pretty good record."
4,i like this group it makes you feel young again,this album is a nice hip hop and dance song i like cameltoe its is a very up beat song.
4,Not a music nerd,"Ok, so this isn't everybody's style. All I can say is- listen to the previews- if you like it, you'll love the cd. If you don't like the previews, don't expect to hear anything different on the album. I LOVE this cd- these sexy babes are young and mouthy. The producers have mixed styles and sounds in a way that is playful and professional- no one is taking this too seriously (cameltoe) but these guys do know what they are doing. Check it out!"
4,FUN DEBUT,"""SO STYLISTIC"" is the debut of the new york trio FANNYPACK. In the same vain as L'TRIMM and J.J. FAD the group comes with a banging cd of fun, silly, booty-bass rap music. The hilarious first single ""CAMELTOE"" and ""THEME FROM FANNYPACK"" get things rolling. They are definitely the stand outs.The banging ""SYSTEM BOOMIN'"", ""SMACK IT UP"", and ""BROOKLYN PUBLIC"" are also dancy pop winners. This is one of the sleepers of the year and is one of the top cds this year. They are in a class by themselves right now and that means with fresh beats and goofy rhymes they can only get better!"
4,As Advertised,"Book in great shape. Contains very good, comprehensive information much of which is applicable to all types of car restoration. I am using it for a Chevy and Ford truck restoration."
3,Wasn't what I expected,This book is cool but I thought it would have exploded diagrams and break down procedure more for rec reading than an actual how to book
2,not specific enough,"The book has some basic ideas, but I was looking for more specifics such as reassembly order and tips, which were not given."
4,Good reading to get you going on that truck!,"I have had this book for several years and go back to it often to motivate and inform me on the restoration of my '52. They tend to favor the Advance Design series trucks, but there are commonalities for all year trucks. I really found useful the chapters on how to disasemble and clean. The book was full of helpful tips and ideas. Home brew degreaser, metal cleaning and rust memoval/repair tips, etc. The book was fairly well written and easy to understand without being simple or condesending. There are good pictures that help illustrate what you are reading about. I highly reccomend this book."
3,Disappointed,"I am restoring a 1953 Chevrolet 5-window cab pickup. I was looking for a manual, catalog, book that would give me some detail about the project I am undertaking, like whether to replace or repair the body work, etc. While this book offered some interesting information, I found it too generic for my tastes. If you are ""just thinking"" about undertaking this kind of project, this might be an interesting read. If, however, you want some good usable information, even tech stuff, the internet/google will provide so much more."
1,just tear it open already!,"I work at a bookstore that seems to have a lot of non-book items. At one point we referred to these items as sidelines, now they are called gifts. for some reason we had this game in stock. Its a neat little game where you shake the box and maneuver the little yellow dice into respective holes so that you may have your fortune read. The employees of the bookstore kept rolling the dice, but never receiving their fortunes (they were wrapped in plastic, and so consequently we were unable to read the fortune that was on the bottom of the lid. For days we played with that thing at the counter until finally I couldn't resist, I had to know my destiny.As with everything, its not as fun once you figure it out. kinda makes me feel better, knowing that every fortune is a good one. Somehow simply by playing with the box makes everyone a little luckier."
3,"Not the ""classic"" versions I expected...","I bought this CD hoping to hear the classic Lauder recordings I grew up with, mostly acoustic Victors and an Edison cylinder or two. Instead, the collection is heavy on a later ""live"" recording of Lauder, leaning heavily on a retrospective set of his hits. Interesting, but not as good as the originals. I do wish the CD had any information re: the origin of the recordings. The sound quality is fair, a bit on the bland side for my tastes."
4,Exelent work!!,"This is my favority album from SYL, I was think the remaster will be better but is almost the same, justa have new artwork and the bonus songs like the demo version are so good! are another view from the same songs! but if you are a brutal fan of SYL i recomend buy this album!"
3,Decent.,"I've had one of these for about 3 years. The plastic knob broke almost immediately, but the switch stem is a common size - just about any generic appliance knob will work. My local car-parts store had a knob assortment that worked for it.I've found it a VERY slow cooker, even when used exclusively on the ""high"" setting. When full, it can't seem to maintain a simmering temperature. I'm not sure if this is because the heating elements are low-power, or because the lid doesn't fit quite right. When the lid is on, there's a 1/8"" open crack between the crockery and the lid on each side, which lets the steam escape. It's a glass lid, so it couldn't have warped. It must simply be manufacturing variances.I previously had aCrock-Pot 3060-W 6-Quart Round Slow Cooker, White(although it was an older model). It met an untimely end when set upon a hot stove burner, but I was much happier with it. Still, though, this Hamilton Beach cooker gets the job done, eventually."
2,Stopped heating sufficiently on 2nd use. :(,"I bought this locally a few days ago and immediately made a lamb broth that was simmering on the high setting within a couple hours. I filled it to capacity.Today, 2nd use, I started a chicken broth, (with raw chicken) and put on high at 10:15 am. At 2:15 pm, still on the high setting, it had not even begun to simmer. Oddly, I did start to smell it cooking around the 1 hour mark ,then nothing more. After 4 hours of raw chicken in hot water, I'm fairly certain the broth will not be safe to eat. Nonetheless, I left it on low setting for the afternoon, and when I came home 5 hours later, it was still not even bubbling a little. THe first and only other time I used the cooker, it bubbled even on low. This is going back to the store. How sad. I wish I could get a refund for the ingredients I'll now have to throw out. :("
2,"unsafe unsafe unsafe - if you like getting burned, get this.","Perhaps this is the state of the crockpot art... but these uninsulated exteriors! I badly burned my arm during the holidays, and just grazed the outside a second ago, it was SO HOT - I burned my pinky knuckle and dropped a big jar of pepper and lost about half of it. Tiny contact, and I can still feel the burn.This, and the rubber feet on this crockpot destroyed the finish of my dining room table (the chemicals in the feet discolored the wood THROUGH THE FINISH). I'm so not impressed.I'm looking for a new crockpot with metal bumps for feet, and with an insulated exterior - hey, much like the crockpots of 30 years ago..."
5,Great value for the price,"This cooker is easy to use and I've been inspired to try different recipes, including stews, braised meats, and soups. Haven't been bored with it yet."
4,Very good,"The crockpot was exactly what I wanted and was just as described in everything I read beforehand. It works perfectly, I am very pleased with everything about it."
4,"Size great, but slow cooker that cooks fast","I loved the design and 4 qt size of this slow cooker, because it's just my boyfriend and I. The size is just right, and it's been pretty easy to clean. Haven't had the infamous 'knob breakage' issue. However, even on low this slow cooker manages to dry out pork chops in no time. I don't know if it's the heating element on this or what, but it almost defeats the purpose of even using it. It seems like if you want moist succulent dishes your best bet is to go with an oldie version of this."
3,My knob broke too.,Just one day it was broken.... no idea how it happened. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it now. It was ok until that happened. I've only used it about 10 times I guess -- I'd only had it for 6 months.
5,Many great meals,"The actual cooker part of this does feel very flimsy when you take it out of the box, I was skeptical. However, it does a great job. You can perfectly fit a whole four pound chicken in it and make a great meal. I have been using it once or twice a week for the last six months and it works as great as it did the day I got it."
3,Another Member of the Broken Knob Club Here,"I absolutely loved this item until the knob broke off. The next time I wanted to use it, I tried turning the knob with pliers but just couldn't do it so a male friend did it (with the pliers).It's such a shame because this really was a great product. No more Hamilton-Beach cookers for me."
5,Just what I wanted,"Just what I wanted. Mid size slow cooker that looks nice, cooks well and costs little. No problems so far. Knob is fine. I was a little worried about the reviewers who had problems with the heat control knob, but so far so good. Would recommend to family and friends as a good find."
4,Fine for its size,"I bought this pot to have a slightly smaller one than my 6 qt, but I find that I end up using the 6 qt. most of the time. I tried a pot roast in this one yesterday (2 pound roast with onions, carrots, and potatoes, and it was too small. For smaller dishes, it's fine, but if you are only going to have one slow cooker, I'd recommend a larger one. My larger one has an automatic feature that takes the cooker from high to low after 2 hours, and I love that, but can't find another that does that. If you see one, consider it; it is great to cook at both levels - first to get the contents hot and then cook them on low for several hours.I like the oval shape of this cooker. I just need to find smaller dishes I want to make!"
2,"Loved it, until the knob cracked in half","This slow cooker worked great until the knob cracked in half on low setting and fell off after only four uses. I cannot turn the knob now, even with pliers, so I have to replace it. I was very disappointed."
4,great for the price,"What more could you ask for, the price is great and I haven't had any problems whatsoever with it. I've used it quite a few times; crocks great for making beef stew and other beef dishes. This one was cheap and it does its job well."
2,no customer support at all,"I love the way it cooks, BUT the knob broke after I'd had it for about a month, and used it about 4 times (once a week). I glued it back together (as I saw someone else had done in a previous review) but the knob broke again today, and I'd only used it about 3 times since glueing it. I tried to get help from their customer support and was put off and then just ignored.I would recommend buying something else other than this one."
5,Fantastic purchase!,"I have used this numerous times since I bought it from Amazon. I love this cooker. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and it's consistent cooking every time. It's the perfect size for my family of three. If you don't have a slow cooker, this is one you should definitely consider."
2,Slow cooker issues,I purchased this item and had it sent to my sister as a gift. She used it twice. The finish on the interior of the cooking pot came off and she is concerned about using it again. Is there a warranty for this item and how would I get it replaced? thank you
4,nice crock!,this is a well made product that i got for a great price on amazon.it did all that was expected and cooked as promised
2,Pretty but knob is main limiter,"We've had this cooker for ~6 months, and just a few days ago the knob split in half. Looking at it, it appears the knob (which is plastic) is set too closely to the heat and melts, causing it to break when you turn it. It looks pretty -- all flush with the rest of the exterior -- but I can't help wishing for one like my mother's: ugly, orange, knob that sticks out 2"" from the rest, and lasting 20+ years."
4,Replacement Knob,"My knob broke after about 5 uses. I e-mailed the company about a replacement and got no response. After reading through the reviews, I saw a suggestion to go to Radio Shack to get a replacement knob. Of course they didn't have one exactly like the one that originally came on the slow cooker (which is probably a good thing since it was such poor quality), but I got a knob that has a little screw in it that can be tightened to allow it to turn the stem. It seems to work fine. I think I paid $2.99 for it. Otherwise the slow cooker works great."
4,Great little cooker,"I got this to replace my expensive Cuisinart slow cooker. So far it has worked great. It is just my husband and I so it is the right size for us. If you like to cook big batches of food, though, you might want to get a 5 or 6 quart cooker."
3,Nothing exciting,"It's what I was expecting, an inexpensive slow cooker. Seems a little flimsy but heats up nicely and looks attractive."
3,ok- but could be a lot better,"My biggest gripe with this model is that there is no light to show it is on. That can be annoying when there are other people in the house doing things like unplugging appliances, and turning things off. You might not notice if someone turns the cooker off while you are cooking. Unless you touch the unit, or look inside to see if things are still boiling, you would not know if it's on. This unit also seems to have some serious cleaning issues. Because this (apparently) needs less liquid than other cookers, we've had some boil overs- and I'm having a really hard time getting the base cleaned up. I never had that problem with my old cooker which I got from Costco. I'm wishing I'd gotten another of those- even though the handles kept breaking off those units. The handle on this one has not been an issue for us, nor has the knob. We have been using this for about a year- and we cook in it several time a week, sometimes twice a day."
4,Great Cooker..Except for that knob!,I really like the way this cooker cooks. With the heating elements on the side it will not burn things like my last two cookers. No frills but I can accept that. Perfect size for a family of 4. The only problem is the plastic temprature control knob. Mine broke like several reviewers after about 9 mos. I crazy glued it and it works fine for now. I called customer service 1-800-851-8900 and they said a replacement knob is $13 post paid. That's approaching 1/2 of the cost of a new cooker.
4,white blotches on crock,"I originally purchased a Rival crock pot, but the second time I used it it didn't turn on and I came home 12 hours later to no dinner. I had to toss the fairly expensive food I'd been trying to cook because it sat out all day. So back to the store it went, and I ordered this one. I've used it at least every week for the six months I've had it and have had no problems! It cooks great at good temperatures and I really enjoy using it. The only thing is that, like another reviewer, after the first couple times using it the black crock has strange white blotches in it even though it's clean. The spots disappear if you get them wet. It looks kind of gross, but I know it's clean. So, 4 stars because of that."
5,It does not cook 4-quarts of food,"BUYER BEWARE: The you can only cook about 2 1/4 quarts of food in the 4-quart model. It holds 4 quarts to the top of the pot, 3 quarts to the rim of the pot that the lid sits on, and about 2 1/4 quarts, or less, of food that you can cook. If you have any questions on how much food the unit can cook, call their Customer Service at 1-800-851-8900.The heat settings work well and the temperature knob has not broken yet, although it has only been used a few times."
1,Knob broke,"In less than a month the knob broke. It's very thin plastic. I can can use a pair of pliers, but why should I. I also cannot tell what setting it is on without the knob. So it is now junk."
5,Wonderful,"We've had this a little over four months now, although we only really started using it about 6 weeks ago. We've used it at least once a week, and the results are amazing. Having never owned or used a slow cooker in the past, I can't do a great comparison, but I can say how good this little wonder is.We've followed recipes to the letter and each time the meal has been perfect. Never burnt, never boiled, always tender meat, delicious juices. The low setting seems great for leaving to stew for a full day -- I cooked pulled pork on low for 10 hours and it melted in our mouths. Tonight we just made beef in espresso and red wine (8 hours on low) and it was fantastic. We're a family of 3, so it is the perfect size. Seems to handsomely hold a typical 6 qt recipe, although it gets closer to the top than it probably should.Can't really say enough good things about this gadget. We've already started making up recipes and variations."
2,The latest member of the broken-knob club,"I really enjoyed this cooker for about 10 months - then the cheap plastic knob suddenly broke. It shattered into more than a half-dozen shards and there was no way to glue it back together. After a few days of using a pair of pliers to set the temperature, I threw out the cooker and bought a different brand. I am deeply disappointed in my experience with Hamilton Beach products."
4,Good investment,"I've used this product twice within the 30-days that I had it. Both times, I was pleased with the results. You only need minimal water and food/soups cook up nicely for a group of 4. The bowl removes easy and cleans just as easily. Non-stick surface. Handles do not get hot. Excellent product for what little money I paid for it."
3,slow cooker,"It is a nice attractive cooker.It seems to work quite well,but the cover knob is irritating.I like the 4quart size."
4,I am very happy with this.,"For the price, this slow cooker is a great find. The cooker works great and cooks well. I would but again."
4,My first slow cooker,"I've managed to make it through life barely knowing how to cook. I've never owned a slow cooker, but when this one went on sale for $10, I seized the opportunity. So, this is like my adult version of an easy bake oven. I found some recipes online, and I've been experimenting so far with chili, beef stew, and a pot roast. I THINK they've all turned out well - so far I haven't had anyone else eat the food but myself, but when I get a little more confidence, I'm sure I'll share!This is a very nice, basic cooker, but I imagine I will eventually like to upgrade to a programmable one with a few more bells and whistles.Finally, to chime in with others, I have not experienced any problems with the knob."
2,mangled box- can't speak for the actual pot,The product box was so mangled I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift. Every corner was smashed in and there was a slice through the top from a box cutter. I won't know what the condition of the actual crock pot is in until the recipient opens it.
3,Nancee Swartz,"Nancee Swartz. For a slow cooking device, I have found it to be well-made and durable. We have used it for several occasions. It holds 6 quarts which is a medium sized entree and large enough for most produce. It is also made of stainless steel and is easy to clean in the dishwasher. Nancee Swartz"
3,dial broke.,"I bought this crock pot a few month ago and it works well except for the plastic dial and plastic surround. The prolonged heat seems to have weakened the plastic and it has broken apart. So now, in order to change the temp, I have to use pliers. Other than that the crock pot works great. I like the oval design for my roasts and odd shaped meats."
4,what they forgot to mention....,"This is a very nice cooker but what I did not see mentioned, and came to realize only by experience, is that the silver metal portion of this coorker gets very hot, as in it's the actual ""burner"" for the crock."
1,lucky it didn't start a fire,"On the first use, the plastic part of the base melted to the ceramic part of the cooker. It created a stinky cloud that took about 3 days to air out of my apartment. In retrospect, I'm lucky it didn't start a fire in my kitchen."
4,great value,"you get a great product for your $$ here. it's smaller than most crock pots (a plus for my very small kitchen), perfectly functional, and though the insert is a bit hard to clean, overall no reason not to get this."
5,I like it a lot!,"Like most other slow cookers the high setting is burn setting if you have SLOW cooking in mind. The high setting is good for bringing the contents up to temp fast, just don't leave it there much over one hour! For $20 I thought this crock might look and feel cheap. It does NOT. I was surprised that it had a glass lid! We've only used it a few times, but so far it has far exceeded our expectations!"
2,knob broke after 2 uses...,This unit cooks well and heats well. It is not easy to clean ( I guess because it is black; I always think it is clean until it dries and then you see it's not). The biggest negative issue I have with this unit is the temperature control knob breaking after only 2 uses. It cracked in half and fell off while sitting there heating. This must be cheaply made for it to do this.
1,The Knob BROKE BROKE BROKE,"Like everyone else, the knob of my slow cooker broke after a few usage(I read the reviews, so I tried not to touch it at all). I called support and they were not apologetic at all, and want to charge $9.75 for the knob + shipping. Without the knob, it is such a pain to change the settings. I would not recommend this slow cooker."
5,Super Funny,"Really funny anime. Very stereotypical of countries and their people but all in good fun. Love the characters and anime style. Wish most the writing in the show was translated from Japanese though, instead of the subtitles."
5,Prepare to die laughing,"I will say now, I did not expect to love Hetalia. My friend introduced it to me. Typically, I don't like things that are incredibly popular (and if anyone's been to an anime convention, the sheer number of Hetalia cosplayers proves this show's popularity). However, I could NOT STOP LAUGHING all throughout the first season!!! I usually prefer the subbed versions of anime, but I highly recommend watching the dubbed in this case. The jokes are great!!! The accents are hysterical!! The one liners just keep coming!! Warning, there is content some would find offensive, especially if you are incredibly political (America gets quite the reputation), but if you take this with a grain of salt, you will truly ejoy it!"
5,Awesome and cute,"I loved it, I watched it several times. Everything came the way it was supposed to and I watched it in One sitting."
1,id rather gouge my.eyes out than watch this,I heard this series was extremely popular. When I put this in my dvd player I was appalled the voice acting was terrible. And the storyline was bland and repetitive. I have collected and own over 50 anime titles and this was by far the worst anime I've ever seen. For gods sake pokemon offers more than this bilge.
2,"Offensive as hell, stupid and full of stereotypes","While the animation is nice and some parts are charming, some of the jokes are funny but they are mostly few and far between. This anime is full of racism and stereotypes, the episodes are 5 minutes long, there's prejudice against Italians in this anime as it portrays them as weak and stupid. I highly despise this anime. 2.5/10"
4,"I love it, but....","I didn't QUITE get the product that I wanted. I ordered both seasons one and two of Hetalia recently, and I was soooo happy when it came. The DVD's were of good quality, and the packaging of the sets were supposed to be amazing. The only problem was that my set of season one was quite lacking in appearance.From what I've heard and seen, the second box set is supposed to look very similar to the first season's set, but this was not the case in my order. For one thing, my first season doesn't really come in the lovely box that it was supposed to arrive in and no bandana was included. I find that this is a bit ridiculous, because I had to pay more or this season than the second. I just can't rate this product 5 stars knowing that I'm missing some vital components of what I've paid for. But still, this series is hilarious if you aren't easily offended, and I'd recommend it to all."
4,cute DVD,I bought this for my daughter for a gift and watched it with her. It spoofs the relationships between nations in an entertaining way. Anyone who likes anime should like this.
5,Hetalia...one of a kind!,"This anime...is awesome! I was just browsing through anime here on Amazon and saw it. I had never seen it and it was very reasonable on price so I decided ""Oh what the heck"" and ordered it. I have never regreted my decision once. This anime is hysterical! All the characters are just spot on. The accents are brillant! The dub I think is just unreal because these voice actors nailed every word that they spoke. If you haven't seen this, just give it a try. You never know how much you will love something unless you open you mind and eyes and try it."
4,A Nice Entry in the Series,"I had grown disenchanted with the Darlings and their friends and family on Broward's Rock. Out of habit, however, I read ""Dead Days of Summer"" and enjoyed it. I felt that Max and Annie were more *human* in this book, with Annie facing the strain of the speculation that Max may have been (a) unfaithful, and (b) responsible for a death, and with Max struggling with limitations that are not surmontable in spite his incredible wealth. Indeed most of the characters seemed more real (well, with the exception of Laurel... but really, Laurel is nothing short of otherworldly!)"
3,A Nice Little Mystery,"A nice little mystery is the best way to describe this book. Annie's husband, Max, has been accused of murder, but she knows that he couldn't have done it. So she decides to find out what really happened and track down the actual murderer. At first the case seems pretty bad, all evidence points to Max and the little bits that could point in another direction can be easily explained away. As Annie rounds up all their friends to help investigate you are introduced to a tight knit and interesting group that seem willing to do just about anything for each other.As wonderful as the characters were, I had a bit of a hard time really getting into the story. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something just seemed a bit off. It kept me entertained enough to give the next one a try and see how it goes.3/5"
3,VERY SLOW SHIPPING,"The quality of the textbook was good but the shipping process was extreamly slow considering Ipaid for expediate shipping. I didnt receive the text until the 17th day. I definately wouldnt order from the seller, (International books) again."
5,Excellent colorized version of episodes 15 and 16,"Excellent true-to-life colorized version of episode #15 (first aired on January 9, 1965) and #16 (first aired on January 16, 1965). Contains original music and scenes not shown in re-runs. END"
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I have several CDs of orchestral or quartet arrangements of songs originally written as rock. In addition, I am a huge Foo Fighters fan. I was very excited to get a hold of this CD, so much so I ordered it without having heard any of the arrangements. Unfortunately, the arrangements are repetitive and unimaginative, and do little to bring out the energy of the original songs. The performances are at best adequate, and nothing to shout about, and the audio is poorly mixed on the CD- the cello sounded extremely muddy to me.I feel that to be worthwhile, a CD of this sort needs to have cuts that are as good in their own right as the original songs. I have some like that, especially a Led Zeppelin symphonic tribute called 'Kashmir'. I am as likely to pop it into the CD player as I am an actual LedZep CD. I would never choose to listen to Resident Adolescence over the original Foo Fighter versions- they simply aren't good enough."
4,Track Listing,"The samples and the posted track listing don't match up. Here's the order that the samples are in:1 Big Me2 All My Life3 Have It All4 Times Like These5 Everlong6 I'll Stick Around7 Learn To Fly8 Headwires9 This Is A Call10 AnytimeI think that this might be the actual track listing, too."
5,Fantastic!,"Wow, When I bought this I thought it was going to sound [bad]( like a bad midi) but it was great! They got everything down pat. It is timed perfectly. They don't miss a beat, literally! I can't believe I find myself rocking out to classical music. It's great to play around those parents or grandparents that can't take the ""rock"" as well as some can.. :Dproof...that the foo fighters make really great music."
2,"Better Choices for Do-it-Yourselfer's, and NOT BLUE","Likely a very nice light system with excellent styling but probably should be installed at extra charge by an installer. The instructions were not practical for me. I have much experience, am very handy, and was an electrical technician. The lens was not blue as advertised, but clear, so the photo is misleading; perhaps the bulb is blue or emits a bluish light.Pros: StyleCons: Not a BLUE lens (clear) so not as advertisedVery complex wiring instructions.Suggestion: The reviews indicate KC has the most well designed wiring package and simple instructions, which seems to be true. I bought KC and found it to be excellent, simple to install, and less expensive."
3,It Could be better,"Visions of Wimbledon is a cool book, but I was expecting much more of it. There are cool pictures, but I missed more detailed photos and articles about legendary matches, like Bjorg X McEnroe.You won't find much information, but it's not a GREAT artistic photo book. Actually, the photos seemed average to me, much less than I had expected."
3,Disappointed as I was looking for one particular issue,I bought the book specifically to find out how to do mail merge onto letters as I do with my ACT software. The entire book had one page on the topic and did not provide any insight.
4,Pretty good,Juice and Paul killed it as usual. Production is amazing. The only problem I got is the other dude they got on there. He is annoying as hell. If you can get past him this is classic Paul and J's music.
5,CRUNK TO DEATH,"THIS ABOUT ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS THAT THREE 6 MAFIAHAVE MADE.THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM IS CRUNK LIKE ALWAYS.IT GOT ALOT OF CRUNK SONGS ON THERE(WHERE THEY HANG,RUFFEST N***** OUT,HEADBUSSAZ,& U SEE WE POE).THEYJUST ABOUT HAD EVERYBODY ON THE ALBUM,BUT THEY DIDN'THAVE MY BOYZ LIL WYTE AND LORD INFAMOUS.THREE 6 MAFIAIS SO UNDER-RATED.WAIT UNTIL ""DA UNBREAKABLES"" ALBUMCOME OUT THEN YOU SEE HOW THREE 6 MAFIA GET DOWN."
5,Visor / Reebok Tennessee Titans,"Visors seem to be hard to find around Christmas, so I was happy to find this one as a gift for a friend who is 1) a die-hard visor fan and 2) a die-hard Titans fan. It was perfect and he loved it! Great quality and super-fast shipping (even with the 'super-saver' free shipping option!"
1,have you been following the hgh situation?,"HGH precursors and all similar products have been proven useless, but Klatz has made his money, so no problem. Very short exercise sessions of high intensity will help your body create the proper 'mix' of hormones..... Go to your health club and find a weight on the leg press machine that you can do slow reps on for one minute. At the end of the one set, you should find it impossible to move the weight,(and feel horrible :-). Do a similar set of of seated chest press and seated row. YOU'RE DONE! You can do more if you want, according to what results you're going for, but a full effort on these three sets will get your hormones going. Actually, the leg press -alone- will get everything going quite well. Say no to drugs."
4,A good place to start...,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think both this book and HGH are great. This book is a great place to start getting some information on this issue. Perhaps the reason why hgh is not working for people is due to their use of synthetic hgh drugs that have side effects... Myself and some of my family members have been using a natural hgh called yf-8 that causes our body to naturally produce hgh. So, it is not that hgh is bad or doesn't work, it just has to work with your body.This book offers great insight into the many benefits that hgh can do for our aging bodies. Get a copy and see for yourself."
3,Grow Young with HGH,"The book is long winded and in essence probably simple enough for anyone to understand. That being said, it does not refer the reader to their private Physicians strongly enough. If you think you have a hormone deficiency, of any kind, a blood test would be in order. NOT buying what You think you need from a foreign pharmacy, as this could be potentially dangerous and or harmful to your body. While some attention is paid to foods and timing, there should be more emphasis placed on how to get your bodies own ""factory"" to increase production."
1,not one ounce of truth all bent on making a fast buck,The cover indicates that the therapy is scientifically proven. All the work has been done in mice and worms with regard to extending life span. The only widely accepted positive data regarding humans is its short term use in frail older men to increase their muscle mass and decrease rate of falls. There is no attempt at addresing its side effects such as organ enlargement and dysfunction and the greatest problem.. the potential for potentiating aggressive cancers!The book is one big deception feigning medical expertise that is just plain dangerous. The American Academy for Anti Aging Medicine is just a front to market feel good drugs that in the end will kill you prematurely.
4,Sets the standard.,"Excellent presentation of facts involving one of the most exciting medical breakthroughs to come along in decades. Dr. Klatz provides the science and data behind the claims and breaks down the biochemistry in such a manner that makes it understandable to all who read this book. If anti-aging is a part of your medical practice, this book should be on your shelf. If you are not offering anti-aging HGH therapy to your patients, you are doing them a disservice.Dr. David Ormanwww.hghplus.nethghplus@yahoo.com"
5,"Factual, an eye-opener and GH works like nothing else.","We're all looking for answers and we are all trying to accept the fact that we are aging and losing the vibrant health we once had. This book tells you like it is. Open you mind and become aware that there is no need to age to the degree we once did. This book can be the solution to so many of our health issues. Wrinkles, lack of enery, libido, colds, allergies. I've used growth hormone for 8 months and have not had one cold or sinus attack. Have lost all cellulite, toned up my muscles and lost body fat. I'll never stop taking it. I'm 50 years old and before starting GH was about ready to give up. I've got a new life and I plan to feel and look good for many years to come."
5,The Future of Medicine,"As we approach the 3rd millenium, our thinking and management of the diseases of aging will be crucial to the vitality of our society---especially since we now take care of an ever-aging society. As a physician, I believe a hormonal basis of the decline in functioning is the key to understanding the process of aging, and GH-releasers or secretagogues are very poweful and safe nutrients in replenishing normal levels of gorwth hormone. They are scientifically proven to stimulate GH release and can be afforded by the average bear. Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Future of the Medicine!"
5,Recapture Quality of Life with HGH,"Dr.Ronald Klatz book and the HGH oral spray has changed my life. I have suffered with physical pain and chronic fatigued from M.S. for fifteen years. The quality of life since starting with the HGH has improved beyond my dreams. I am a new woman with a brand new lease. I read Dr. Klatz book, listened to his radio interviews and started on the HGH. I noticed improvements in my physical well being in days--now four weeks later it just keeps getting better. I found a distribution Company in the area met the owners and bought six bottles. My own clinical trials has been giving a bottle of the HGH oral spray and Dr. Klatz book to family and friends. I no longer am sick and tired of being sick and tired."
3,RAH RAH RAH!,"Dr. Klatz is a chearleader for human growth hormone, a miraculous substance that is the new fountain of youth (!?) He idealizes bodybuilders; the substance itself sounds suspiciously like those wonderful anabolic steroids. I question somewhat the credibility of this book. To the author's credit, even HE says more research is needed on these substances."
5,Fascinating book -- I could hardly put it down.,"I received a copy of this book when I was introduced to HGH in an affordable form. It was exciting to learn that the ""average"" person now has access to HGH, rather than just the wealthy. Aging doesn't have to be inevitable, as we all previously thought. When a person reaches the age of 50 (and I am assuming that others feel as I did), even though we don't look ""old"" as 50-year-olds did a number of years ago, taletale signs of aging are evident: age spots, wrinkles, graying hair, hair loss, diminished eyesight and muscle tone, loss of vigor and sexual desirability. It is very exciting to learn of a simple and medically proven safe way to reverse the aging process and regain a youthful appearance and a more healthy body, as we had twenty years earlier. I've told all of my friends about HGH and the fascinating case studies presented in the book."
4,"See ""Let the right one in"" also!","This is based on the Scandinavian version of ""let the right one in"".It puts this to shame.Otherwise - this is a good movie by itself."
4,Let Me In Review,"This movie was a very ""dark"" take on a really interesting story. Sure, the kids wrap you around their fingers so to speak. Owen...OMG - LOVE HIM!! His story will melt your heart!! Abby, on the other hand...for being what she is,...is really a hero. Talk about mental turmoil. My best part about this movie?...(quite unexpected from my end mind you)...was when the Blue Oyster Cult ""I'm Burning"" song came on. I kinda freaked myself a bit, because, as gruesome as the scene was,...like a silly, I was completely wrapped up by the impeccable song choice - JAMMING!!...PERFECT song, perfect movie to match it to...I am glad that I saw this movie. It was very touching & meaningful in a very dark way...leaves something left on your ""palate"" when trying to figure out how far back this story REALLY began, or, how much further this story really will live on. I'd say - watch it."
3,It was ok....,"I guess I don't know what ""horror"" means anymore. I thought the movie was slow paced and for a movie called, ""The Best American Horror film in 20 years"" I just didn't see it. The movie as everyone else said is about an 11yr old boy who is bullied at school but forms a friendship with the mysterious stranger. There was nothing about this movie that stood out to me. I'm just happy I used a promo code for it or else I'd be wanting my $3.99 back"
5,Who would have thought!,"...that I would see the day when I watch and enjoy a vampire romance. One of the most despised genres in my book!Ok, it is more horror than romance, and the romance is of a very tender age of 12 years, and stays appropriate to the age. No Lolita vampirism here, no precocious liberties either. More holding hands and shy smiles. And the young lady shows her horror mettle in a sufficiently creepy way to keep you interested.Very good remake of a Swedish hit movie after a novel called Let the Right One In.Recommendable if you appreciate the occasional better horror."
5,Loved it!!!!!!,"A dark, deep love story, not to be missed!!! I have to admit I can watch this over and over again and it continues to hit my sensitive side repeatedly. Although slightly different from the Swedish original, the main ideas of the story are intact and the changes seem to tighten up this remake."
3,Nothing to get scared about....,"Interesting story, pretty good acting, saw the outtakes and don't understand (even with the directors reasoning)why they were left out. They didn't amount to a lot of time and in my opinion would have made the movie a little bit better. Glad I didn't spend a lot of money to watch in the theaters though."
1,"A tragedy and a farce, all in one.","This could have been an interesting American reinterpretation of /Let the Right One In/, but it's not. It's a sliced and diced, barely-recognisable shadow of the source material, which was deemed to be ""too Swedish"", whatever that is.Just watch the original."
1,Confusing and Pointless,"Okay, so I watched this movie last night, and I had no idea what I was watching.A kid is bullied at school, this strange little girl visits him at night and says she can't be his friend because, ""That's just the way it is."" Okay, but who is she? Why does the kid care?Then there's this guy going around killing random people and stealing their blood. Then we find out the little girl is a vampire. I honestly didn't know what was going on, I didn't know any of the character's names and it was just confusing to me. Why was this movie made? It should have been 3 different movies. One about the vampire little girl, one about the kid and his problems at school, and one about the serial killer.I turned it off after 35 minutes and watched something else. I just can't recommend it to anyone."
1,Unwatchable!,"This movie was by far the worst remake I've ever seen. It was completely unwatchable. Every single scene was stretched out to an intolerable length. It was 2 hours worth of long and slow panning shots. Almost every shot was a slow panning with an aweful musical score that tried to make every scene dramatic. I would honestly say that maybe 30 minutes of the 2 hours actually had any dialog. There was nothing good about this movie. The cast, camera work, music, and lighting were all horrible.Save yourself the time and watch the original ""Let the Right One In"". It was an excellent film that was made just a couple years before this remake."
1,not a good movie,"i thought this movie was just dumb, had no good story line, and didn't keep me wanting to watch more. waste of my time."
5,Great movie!,"Very fast shipment, only a few days. Would recommend. Will purchase again. Have before & will continue to do so. Thanks!"
3,Interesting Movie with an Old Theme,"I wasn't too sure what to expect from this movie. I've watched other 'vampire' movies but this was different. Not better, not worse, just different from the usual commercial vampire storyline.I didn't see the original and I didn't read the original book so my expectations were open. The movie is pretty dark and gloomy most of the time (which makes sense because of the main character's 'condition'. I was enjoying it to some extent until the first attack scene where the special effects went very 70's. Unrealistic, odd, stilted movement quickly dissolved any suspension of reality while watching.It has such a dark and depressing theme throughout, the scenery, characters, and events were all big downers while watching.What I did like is the fact that it was not the usual box office American movie. It was unique enough to keep me watching but too depressing to watch again."
5,A Good Remake,"This remake of the spectacular Swedish film ""Let The Right One In"" is worth watching. Featuring a child vampire trapped forever at the physical and mental maturity of a 12 year old, it provides a nice twist on the vampire mythos and plenty of good bloody violence. You will also get to enjoy the disturbing feeling that you have been somehow compromised by this film, probably because it gets you to cheer for a devil, just because she is cute and fun to watch."
4,Far better than Swedish version,There is no comparison between this one and the Swedish one. This version is much better. Chloe does a brilliant job here.
2,Useless Remake,"This was a useless remake..the first film (""Let the Right One In"") was much better in every way. I bought both movies and I gave ""Let Me In"" away. It's really not worth watching again."
2,Vampire movie,"Well I was hoping for a scary movie but this movie was just weird and creepy. if you want to be scared by this movie watch the trailers,they are the scariest scenes from the movie.Acting is only OK and the blu-ray quality is not what you'd expect form a high def disk. I really wanted this to be a good scary vampire flick but it wasn't."
5,American remake,"I was very hesitant at first to pick this one up at the store.I had discovered the original swedish version ""Let The Right One In"" a few years back and really enjoyed the atmosphere and acting.Now comes ""Let Me In"" the american version of the same story.It's a very good adaption that really stays true to the original story without really messing it up.It's really hard to favorite one over the other because both are good.I was very happy that this film did not dissapoint my expectations of a great human/vampire story."
3,Faithful to Book,"Watching this was just like reading the book again. If I had liked the book I would have liked the movie's faithful reenactment of the plot. The movie looked good, and the acting was fine. The problem is the story, and the pacing. Here is my review of the book.""Inside the cover of this book is a fantastic vampire story, but either something got lost in the translation or the editors missed a lot of opportunities to ratchet up the tension. I enjoyed the book immensely through the first 200 pages, but after that found myself hoping for more scares and more vampiric mythology. This could've been a great book, and maybe it was in its original language. It left me longing for a really good vampire book, something like Salem's Lot, The Vampire Lestat, or Dracula."""
4,Good movie.. but not as good as the book.,"Got this for my husband as a stocking stuffer after it was offered on one of the lightning deals. Good movie with an interesting story! I read the book and really liked it so I thought we would enjoy the movie. While it isn't as good as the book, it is still quite good. I haven't seen the other version of the movie, so I can't compare the two"
4,"Spooky, romantic, & gory","I had heard that this was a rare case of the American version being better than the European one. It was definitely a bit gorier, and much more clear. There were parts of the Euro version that I just did not understand and it wasn't because of the language barrier, but the subtlety of the filmmaking. It followed the plotline very closely. I thought the European actress was a bit more effective at looking spooky and starving and pathetic all at the same time. Chloe Grace Moretz is a wonderful actress and has that wise/old look in her eyes, but her face is still a little bit cherubic to pull this off. I love Richard Jenkins and felt like his character was fleshed out (pardon the pun) a bit more in the American version.Definitely a well-made film, very moody and dark."
3,Movie was okay,"Film was shot very dark. Pretty good acting. No animals get hurt! Not scary at all, so if you are looking for horror, I don't think it's a good choice. But it was good."
1,Let me in made me want to ask to let me out,"Very slow moving movie, quite depressing. I'm usually open minded about movies and books but this one really could have used more in plot. Definitely wouldn't be a movie I would recommend although the person that recommended it to me was quite thrilled with it."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I hate vampire movies and the whole concept of vampires in general, but I had to see this movie based on the strong buzz it was getting. Based on an award winning Swedish film, Let Me In, tells the story of a lonely 12 yrs old kid who is befriended by a vampire, who moves in next door. Chloe Moretz was amazing as Abby, following her role in Kick-Ass, this girl is definitely going places. I didn't like Abby much thou. I found her very manipulative, not to mention how creepy it is that an ageless vampire, who looks like a little girl, is hooking up with a 12 yrs old kid. While the critics loved this film, I saw it as a dark, slower, more gory version of Twilight, except with younger kids. To be honest with you, the whole thing kind of just weirded me out."
2,defective disc,"Movie great, except the last 1/4 to 1/2 the picture would freeze and disc would have to be restarted and go to select scenes and start from there to find the scene I wanted to go to. Sometimes this would work, sometimes it wouldn't. this happened 3 or 4 times, this sort of ruins the movie when this part is pretty intense."
4,"Great movie for the vampire genre fans, but not very scary as it claims.","Great movie, but it was a bit predictable for me as most vampire movies tend to be. This was Chlo Moretz' first movie after being in ""Kickass"" and she played her role very well. In terms of being ""the best horror movie in 20 years"" as the box claims, I wouldn't go that far. This is definitely more of a thriller than a horror movie. A collectible comic book inside was a nice bonus as well."
2,A little disapointing...,"I won't go too far to down this movie seeing as how I watched it when it first came out...(think it was last year, I believe), but this review will be kinda backwards. I watched this because my fiancee said it was interesting. Now, I didn't know until the last minute that he watched the Swedish version and read the book. When we watched the American version, it made no sense and even he said that. The American verion has a lot of scenes where it was cut out from the Swedish one and it made you sit in the theater wondering---""Okay, what the hench is this?"" or,----""Did they leave out some parts?"" A lot of my associates who I don't like said that it was scary. What? A girl killing a man just for his blood? I really don't like to down this because, in my opinion, it would've been decent if he didn't show me the book and the Swedish movie before I saw this. But Let The Right One In(Swedish) is much better and put together storywise than Let Me In(American)."
2,Eh...,I did not love this. I thought there would be some out there American interpretation. It was as if the same screenplay from Let The Right One In was used. Movies spoil books!
1,Dont buy this,This is a horrible remake of Let the right one in. Once again hollywood brainless remake instead of coming up with an original story. Buy Let The Right One In!!
2,Bleh,"I was thrilled when I heard this movie was released by Hammer, but was soon disappointed when I began watching it. The quality of the DVD is fine, but the movie is as dull and slow as watching paint dry."
2,Terrible,"I am sure many will disagree, but what a lousy movie. I am certainly not on the edge of my seat in anticipation of seeing ""Let the Right One In"" after seeing this one. ""Best Horror movie in 20 years""? In that case, I would hate to see some of the bad ones. Very slow, not much happening the whole movie. It was not at all scary, not even a little bit. It just dragged and dragged the whole time. Longest 2 hours ever. If you enjoy vampire plots, check out The Vampire Diaries. It's a show, but about 100 times better than this."
2,"""REMAKE""??","Can anyone tell me what the point is of copying another movie almost verbatim, scene for scene? They're calling ""Let Me In"" a remake ofLet The Right One In, but shouldn't a remake have a slightly different feel or tone to it? Let Me In is simply a talented film school exercise."
4,In 3 words: Substance and Horror,"Ever watch a horror movie, but it was horrible and not horrifying? Well, this one manages to be a good movie, while at the same time giving you the creeps.I haven't watched the original, because apparently the subtitles on the rental from Amazon are horrendous. I will wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray.Anyway, read the Wikipedia article on the book, it's a different story altogether, albeit with the same basic structure.I'd watch it again."
4,Great Vampire Love Story,First off let me say I never saw the original Let The Right One In so this review is just based on this movie. I thought this movie was well thought out. It's not your typical vampire movie which I liked. Granted it did involve killing but it had a great storyline which just added to the movie. This movie was more creepy and eerie than it was scary so be forewarned. I loved how they took a vampire movie and incorporated a love story. You do not see this very often which makes this movie a true gem. The two main characters (Abby and Owen) showed great chemistry together and they portrayed a great love story.If you are looking for a fresh new vampire movie with a love story then look no further than Let Me In. You also get a little comic book as an added bonus!!
5,"Sublime, Scary, Superb","It's hard for me to put in words just how much I liked this movie. Sublime, scary, superb. I could go on. This is the be all and end all of vampire movies as far as I'm concerned. The story was dark, moody and exciting.Yes, I figured out early on how the story had to end, but I couldn't stop watching and when it was through, I started it again, watched it straight through again. I don't think you can give a movie a higher compliment than that."
4,"Beautiful film, though I still like the original more","If this was my first introduction to this story I probably would have given it 5 stars, but because it's remaking such a recent film (2009's Let the Right One In), my heart still lies with the original. This version is actually very similar in a lot of ways (the boy chosen as the lead character is almost eerily similar to the boy in the original), and it is BEAUTIFULLY shot and acted, but there was something a little more real to the relationship between the children in Let the Right One In. I would absolutely recommend this film, but if you had to pick between the two, I'd lean a bit more towards the Swedish rendition.Book was great too!"
4,Pretty good,Very dark and awesome. I haven't seen the original movie. I just finished getting the first one. But so far as the remake its overy great movie to watch. I loved it.
5,Let Me In is one of my favorites,"Teen AngstAppropriate ViolenceInteresting RelationshipsGood Special EffectsGreat EndingIf you enjoy the genre, then you have to watch this one..."
5,Got the Movie fast,I recievd the movie as discribed and got it in time for the holidays and now I can wrap up my packages of movies going to someone dear to me..
1,"Ham-handed direction, unnecessary film","I decided to place my pre-conceived feelings on the film aside and watch ""LET ME IN"" with a friend to see how it held up as a movie, and (obviously) to the original film. Without getting long-winded, I walked away with this as my overall feeling: the director (Matt Reeves) did nothing on his own to make this film work. He re-created a lot of the same scenes and shots, and stylistically made the film look similar to the original, but in a way that felt forced, and knock-off, ham-handed and amateur. The care didn't seem to be there for each shot, the painstaking craftsmanship was gone, and what was left was a shell of a film, with it's only legs being the memory of its predecessor. I can't recommend the film to anyone, and would implore you to watch the original (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) to see what a beautiful, and unique movie experience is supposed to feel like.Truly disappointed, and put off."
3,Let The Right One In - Lite version,"Essentially, this is a pre-digested version of the Swedish original. All the 'money shots' from the first film are replicated here, while the story is trimmed down--with many supporting characters simply absent.The pace is ramped up a bit too much, and the soundtrack is just out of control. The tone and burn of the original is simply lost here. All due to the actors: the American cast is fine here, but the entire production staff succeeded in puking up a zero-calorie version of a great foreign-language film.Rent, don't buy."
3,Let Me In,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Poorly executed movie,"The movie drags on. It's easy for the viewer to relate to Owen, the 12 year old boy. You hope he's able to overcome his fears and face the older boy that torments him. But Owen doesn't grow or go thru any character development. I felt the movie was not horrific, perhaps a little gory. There is not much of an arc in the story. I was disappointed. The movie is good only to kill time. ""Cloverfield"" was a weak movie as well, and apparently this is the same writer. There is something about American-made movies that looses a lot (of plot & storyline) when compared to it's international counterpart."
3,It is not a scary movie.,"I really thought this would be a good horror movie I could add to my collection. Sadly, it is just a good movie with some gore in it. A bit predictable as well. Thankfully it is not a sappy movie like ""Twilight"" and unfortunately not scary like ""A Haunting in Connecticut."" So what, the vampire child gives the wimpy kid some advise on dealing with bullies, it really did not work. And as predicted, she comes to his defense in the end. Stephen King added his two cents ""the best horror movie in 20 years."" Really??? It is just a good story. Some of the reviews on Amazon say that the American remake has more special effects. If that is true, then I won't waste my time watching the original. Kids are great in creepy movies and have the potential to make the movie that much more creepier or fun. This movie failed at both ends. It was just a good story with an open end."

5,A little tease around 1970,I played Tobacco Roody and Midnight Plowboy at my theater in Ohio. I was busted showing them. Today they are mild and not near pornographic. More female nudity than what I remembered but they are comedy films and fun to watch.
5,Raunchy,This is a GREAT book for those who are looking for true T&A;It's loaded with great shots and no one will be disappointed.Try it
3,Monty Python Not A Guy Flick!,"The book was otherwise enjoyable but Roeper's classification of Monty Python and the Holy Grail as a guy flick was so dreadfully wrong that now I'm not sure his advice about any movie can be trusted. Roeper says that he has never met a female Pythonite in America. I have to wonder what sort of women he associates with. Either he or they don't get out enough. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a PARODY of a guy flick. This is an important distinction and one a competent movie reviewer should be able to make. It was fake blood, it was fake violence, it was in-your-dreams seductiveness. One of the knights didn't even have a proper horse. He had coconuts! That's funny! When guys do graphic sex, violence and blood and take it seriously it's a guy flick. Big difference.The rest of the book had some interesting, informative and useful content but this misclassification of one of the all time great sidesplitters is just too egregious to be overlooked."
1,A waste of money,"Mr. Roeper has said that he ""doesn't get"" the fuss about Charlie Chaplin, and he gave a ""thumbs up"" to JACKASS: THE MOVIE.Why anybody would pay good money to read a movie book he has written is beyond me."
2,not impressed,"The condition of this used product was excellent -- my issue is with the product itself. I thought I could use this as an educational supplement. (I am a teacher.) However, unless I want to be forcibly chased from my classroom, I will not be subjecting my students to any of the dvds. There are certainly moments in each dvd that are engaging, but these are few."
3,Okay,"The DVDs are okay. Plenty of good information, but a dreadful narrator for most of the programs. If you don't mind boring narration, these DVDs are okay."
2,Very very boring,"I borrowed the DVDs from the library and really want to learn some knowledge from them.But they are so dull and boring -- it is painful to keep watching.Finally I went to amazon.com and found out that I am not the only one who ""suffered"" from the dvd set. :)"
3,A LEAPS cookbook.,"If you want to learn about the many LEAPS trading strategies in existence, this book is for you. If you want to learn the theory behind LEAPS (and options) then you have to buy a different book."
5,Mellow....soothing....I love acoustic!,"As an 'acoustic junkie', this CD is great. It is so relaxing and so beautiful. I have fallen asleep to this.....True talent. Mellow, soft and pleasing to the ear. This is a CD I would play for my children if I had any. So for now, the pets have to suffer through it. So, if you are looking for a soothing acoustic CD, check this one out. Play some of the samples, and I believe you'll enjoy it as well."
2,"Five minutes cut from ""Fugitive Girls""!","Add me to the list of extremely disappointed ""Fugitive Girls"" fans here. I have two old VHS copies of this film that run 90 minutes, and compared them with the DVD once I realized some of the strongest scenes were hacked to pieces. The cover art boasts, ""FOR ADULTS ONLY"", which is pretty ridiculous. Even if the best quality print they could find was missing six minutes of the movie (these aren't pointless scenes of gratuitous nudity or even near-X material, there's important dialog and character development in each one, believe it or not), they still should have included the real versions on the DVD. It really would have made a huge difference. I award one star because they even cared to put this on DVD, and another because the movie looks good."
2,No Plan 9 here,"If you are looking for the whimsy that Wood produced in Plan 9, Bride of the Monster etc. it isn't in this collection. These three films are basically sex films, not that there is anything wrong with that. The production quality is cheap, the acting isn't very good, the naked people are ordinary looking. So, if you are an Ed Wood ""completist"" that this is for you. if you like films with lots of sex, you can find better ones."
2,Entertaining Bad Cinema,"The Lacivious World of A. C. Stevens & Ed D. Wood is a 3 disk set of containing 3 movies from two of the most inept film makers ever. The most entertaining of the 3 movies is ""Lady Godiva Rides"", however it is entertaining only because it is laughably bad. The sets (especially the ""boat"" to America) are ridiculous, the action is unbelievably out of character for the time period, and the dialogue is as bad as it gets. There is some nudity and sexual activity, but even that is incompetently done. The other 2 movies are bad, but don't fall into the category of ""so bad they're good"". I found ""Fugitive Girls"" just boring and a little hard to follow, and ""Drop-Out Wife"" was overwrought and mostly about the sex, with some scenes bordering on hard-core. If getting 1 movie that is laughably bad out of a 3 movie set is enough for you, then this is a good purchase. Otherwise...pass."
4,A Percussionist for Percussionists,"""Just My Imagination"" is played at least twice daily, 5 of 7 days. Each time I hear it, I hear something different and enjoy the song more each time. This CD is what 'cool' is all about. If you want to relax and enjoy smooth jazz, I recommend this album."
5,Amazing Work Of Art,I'm a hardcore soad fan and i can say this cd is the best tribute cd i have ever heard. its nothing like that other [junk] tribute cd. this is amazing the way they express the song into violins celos bass etc. the version of aerial is a master piece but ofcorse i really have to credit the orignal creaters SYSTEM OF A DOWN for being the most awsome band in the world.
3,9soad songs?,"If I can fit 2 entire soad cds onto one cdr then the tribute cd should at least have 15 songs on it! This album seemed so rushed that when I travelled to a store to look at it up close it advertised that sugar was one of the songs on it and just look at the tracklist no sugar, no inervision, no chop suey, some of these tributes seem real half-assed. There's an audioslave/soundgarden tribute that has about 10 songs on it. The tool tribue absolutely rocks...everything else is just to sell cds...and where my RATM tribute!! I want to hear tire me on strings!"
3,Typical Vitamin Release,"This album is a standard issue Vitamin record, in the sense that it is short (only 10 tracks; one of which isn't an actual SOAD song), and will appeal to those who like to hear heavy stuff played by a string quartet. I am one of those people who simply loves the idea. As for the album itself, not only is the CD short, but it leaves out some obvious choices like the hit ""Chop Suey"" and other songs that are of a more gentler nature like ""ATWA"". Still, the readings by the musicians are quite good, and suprisingly accurate. Although, the percussion is unnessaary, and defeats the purpose of the concept somewhat. But again, the album is worth it just to hear some great music, like ""Peephole"" and the beautiful ""Spiders"", which is my favorite System song."
3,Strings are always good,"Hey, i'm a metalcore fan, and i really like listening to tributes and listening to strings quartets, but i think it's really absurd to make a tribute to SOAD, it's not a band with a long history... 5 stars to the musicians for their talent, but they chose the wrong band to make a tribute to. If you really like tributes, buy some other cd except this one, i found it really meaningless. Hope this helps you listen to better metal bands like meshuggah, eighteen visions, stampin' ground and stuff like that. You have to be a real SOAD fan (and that's not good news) so you like this tribute."
5,Best biking movie ever!,"This movie is off the hook! It is amazing in every aspect. The riders are awsome and some of the jumps and drops are unbeleivable. The music is also very good and fits in extremely well. This movie is all freeriding, downhill racing, and dirt jumping but is also has Jeff Lenosky doing some crazy street riding. It is a definite buy. Good Luck Riding."
4,This is great!,"This is a great CD. It has many of the ""classics"" I know and love, and also some new songs or new arrangements. Beautiful music."
1,NEED DIMENSIONS!,"This product needs dimensions! I'm searching for just this sort of thing, but it fits into a CLOSET, which has limited DIMENSIONS. Need to know the product DIMENSIONS."
2,description was not clear,"description was not clear, and the bowl was way too small for my thanksgiving dinner, I had to return it."
2,Not as good as Volume 1,"I am not a big Ska fan, but I was pleasantly surprised by the ""Skandalous: Gotcha Covered"" CD. In Volume 2, the covers just aren't as strong as those in the original. The Hawaii-5-0 Theme is the only one that might appeal to a non-ska fan. The rest of the CD sounds like every other ska song I've heard, so it might appeal to a hardcore ska fan."
4,Very good collection,great collection of songs. there are a few i dont know but there are also a ton of great classics. try el pussycat by the timeless skatalites and the hawaii five-o cover is great too. a song i found by accident but is incredible is 'mother' by the independents with evil presley at his best. awesome cd
4,good cd,"dude...this cd is pretty good...the only problem? some of the covers are of songs id never heard of...but theyre still really good songs...and the ones you will recognize (la bamba, turning japanese, hawaii 5-0) are great...this is a cd youll wanna listen to over and over"
3,good if you don't have any of the songs already,"This is a good compilation, featuring decent diversity in labels. There are only a few remixes so, if you already have most of these songs on their respective albums, you won't be too thrilled with this. Nevertheless, it's a good mix of what most modern industrial has to offer."
4,Adding to my collection to undestand and repair lamps....,"This was to be another book to add to my collection as I try to learn , understand and repair lamps of the time.This is NOT the number one book to do so....but I choose it because it wasn't as expensive as the top choices---yet ----gave me enough information in order to learn something and know more about the lamps in order to repair them.Nice book for the library--good pictures of lighting and identifying lamps."
4,Good band reed,"The Caldwell pipe chanter reed is a very good reed for band use. It has a very robust sound and remains stable when played for long periods. Will stand up to some moisture. A bit difficult to break in, and not the best choice for solo playing, but a good reed that will suit several different pipe chanters very well."
4,Time Saver,"I saw this item on HGTV and was intrigued, and I'm happy that I bought it. It is a real time saver for slicing and dicing. Do not be fooled into thinking this can replace a blender or a food processor.For those with small kitchens, it is a bit cumbersome for storage."
2,Worked fine for a while,"I liked the idea of the removable bowl. Easy to shred a batch of vegetables and then store them in the same bowl they were shredded into. I used it 3 or 4 times a week with no problems, for about 2 months. Then it just stopped working. No warning, it just wouldn't come on any more. Now I still have a bunch of bowls that fit it, but I won't buy another of these."
4,Awesome helper,Never thought it would make cooking so much more easier. Now I never have to spend time to cut and shred. All you need to do is to wash the vegetables and put it in the shredder. You even get 3 bowls for multiple veggies. You get another attachment for fine shredding and crinkle cut. I don't know how I ever cooked without this earlier. I am even recommending this to my other friends now! Cooking made easier!
1,Good Idea... Bad Execution,"I was really excited when I received this for Christmas and was looking forward to using this. However I was very unhappy when I took out of the box and found the feed tube to be very small, and only two slicing disk that suck! First task shredding cheese - well most of the cheese was going around the top of the shredding disk, and that was not using the fine shred disk either! Next thing I tried green peppers, after CHOPPING the peppers to fit them in the feed tube I got very disappointing results, - green pepper mush! MMM... The only thing I like about this thing is the cleanup that is it! I use my giant food processor more than this. This is not worth $40, it should be $9.99 and I still don't know if it would be worth it!"
1,Doesn't do anything well,"Had high hopes for this item, but it doesn't do anything well! First, I tried shredding some cheddar cheese, but it jammed the machine by bunching up above the blade. Tried shredding a softer mozzarella with the same result. When the machine jams up, you can smell the motor which seems ready to burn out. Then I tried to slice pepperoni (you flip the blade over for this), but it was sliced too thick and sloppily.The Change-a-bowl stills needs to be cleaned after use. The food pusher, food chute/cover, and shred/slice disc all need to be cleaned.The concept of the Change-a-bowl sounds interesting, but it really doesn't do anything well. I am more appreciative of my Cuisinart now because it slices and shreds easily and is no harder to clean than the Change-a-bowl. Hamilton Beach should retire the Change-a-bowl since it can't even handle the basics. Good marketing, but a lousy product."
4,"Perfect Idea, may need tweaking","I saw this product on an info-mercial and immediately log onto Amazon to see if the product was available there. Amazon had the product at a lower price than the T.V show so I ordered one for myself to try. The size is perfect for making salsa and does a great job with very little spillage from over flow. However, on high speed the mixer tripped my GFI socket. I tried it again to make sure it wasn't that particular socket, but it did it again on a different outlet. You also have to be careful with onions on the high speed; the onions turned to mush. The unit performs very well on the lower speed using the pulse mode. Overall I am pleased with the appliance and would recommend this to anyone looking for a smaller slicer/mixer."
1,junk,"This is a revision of the ""salad shooter"". Leave this one on the shelf, guys and gals, and go out and buy a real food processor. It doesn't handle the medium not to mention the tough jobs, and it is a real pain, literally, for anyone with an arthritic hand. Mine went to the Salvation Army after just one use. Maybe there it will be worth ten cents to someone who needs a sturdy cardboard box."
1,No GOOD!!!,"This product does not perform the functions for which it was designed. Do NOT buy this product, I wish I had returned it with in the first week of having it. A real piece of JUNK!!! cd."
3,abbreviated,"This is a reprint of barely remembered book printed in 1913. It was probably the first to explain to Westerners the history of maths in Japan. Somewhat abbreviated perhaps. You can see how algebra and geometry developed in Japan. With speculation on how calculus from Europe might have influenced 17th century maths manuscripts. While later years brought advances in infinite series and sums.The book may cause some readers to wonder if there have been other, more comprehensive discussions of Japanese maths."
4,The formation of Christian intellectuals,"What books have gone into the formation of Christian intellectuals? This book contains short entries by a group of Christian college professors on the books that have helped to shape their thought. In some cases the choices are delightfully surprising, as for example one philosopher's selection of P. G. Wodehouse novels. This book will stimulate your appetite to read the books these professors recommend."
1,The Diuretic Dialectic,"What else do I need to say? This book is a garbled version of a Siskel and Ebert review of the latest Hollywood releases. While the intentions seem pure, the result lacks discipline and effect. It's overly sentimental and, at points, pretentious. Thanks for listening."
4,KI Gold= DA BOMB,"This game is awesome. Im the kind of gamer who likes classic N64 games, and this is a superb masterpiece to my collection. This one has it all: Graphics, sound, and most importantly, great gameplay. Fighting fans definetly add this one to your collection. Its an oldie but a goodie."
3,"Music, effects, combos fun characters","Silicon graphics and the usual play control equal an easy to learn 3D fighting game. The thing that makes this game really unique are the killer combinations of moves, and the fact that there are tons of special moves for each character, but then when you start doing a combination of moves there are even more special moves! The fighting arenas are visually astounding, especially Spinal's ship. There is even cool fighting music to keep up with the pace of the fight. Speaking of the pace, there are 100s of options, including the speed of the fight, disabling certain moves, damage, and anything you can imagine. Another great part about this game is that there is an actual scale of challenge, which makes it anywhere from easy for a beginner - to difficult for a master gamer. The only disappointing thing is that the original fighters are better than the four new ones."
4,A Rare Glitch,"Killer Instinct is a good fighting game, but could be definitely better for two reasons. In order to see the whole story, you have to defeat the game on all levels (from normal to master) with one character to see his/her whole story unlike other fighters where you get to see the ending even on easy mode. Second, in order to pass the whole game, you need to be an expert in more than one character. Some computer characters become unrealistically difficult and will defeat your character in a few seconds. So, you need to use another character to counter the computer's weakness. And you need to do this often. Remember, this is a Nintendo game which means a fun game for the whole family. Hopefully, Nintendo will do better on the sequel. Let's keep our fingers crossed shall we?"
4,Excellent compilation that has some kicking vibes!!!,"The compilation represents great value for money not to mention wonderful tracks; check out Diana Brown on Love in Return doing her thing, the first time you hear it you will want to put your CD on repeat and the ambient laid back grooves on Like Water are very happenning. This is a good compo because it provides a nice balance of ""Acid Jazz"" sounds ( I am always reluctant to label this music as it encompasses so many aspects and types of sounds). Definitely one for the collection with Ronnie Jordan, Greyboy and some other well known names showing why this music more than any other continues to evolve!!!!Good on you people at SHANACHIE!!!!"
2,Um... seriously?,"For the love of all that is modern and crystal clear, don't waste money on ANY tube-based monitor if you can buy an LCD for the same amount of money, which you can. Why anyone is still selling monitors like this I cannot fathom."
2,Nyeh...,"I watched this one when I was a kid because I loved ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" as everyone does. Unfortunately, I found this one to be a bit scary and mostly unpleasant. A kid goes into the Grinch's wagon of horrors to face a variety of floating grotesques, as taunting music plays in the background. In the end he gets out. This film isn't really necessary; there's not enough Grinch, and too much weirdness."
2,Sadly dissappointing,"Having read the classic ""Nift the lean"" I licked my lips with anticipation when I heard that there was a sequeal/prequeal.I opened the pages expecting something akin to ""The Demon Sea"" sadly that was not the case. I found the writing surprisingly difficult to read lacking the usaul Jack Vance verve and wit combined with a Clark Ashton Smith imagery. Still other Michael Shea fans may disagree, how ever for me it was disappointment becaue I know Michael Shea is an exceptional writer."
4,"Practical, and informative","I found this book both practical and informative, though a bit limited in the amount of theory. It covers the main pathologies behind male sexual dysfunction from a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective."
3,Average,"This album is very average, its too repetative, too meny filler tracks, if u are a rapcore fan u may like this one but it is very unoriginal and nothing new here plus the lyrics just dont cut it they have no meaning and in places are very stupid, you have ben warned"
1,Not particularly useful,A more experienced star gazer might enjoy this better. I'm a beginner and it doesn't help out.
3,Book Report,I read this book for a book report for my 10th grade english class. It was a pretty good book but I wouldn't recommend it for a kid my age to read as a pleasure book. One thing bugged me about this book. Almost every character talked about committing suicide and by the end of the book it started making a little mad.
5,Joshua bass this is his nephew,This is the best cd in the world ad you will find out when you get it because it s my uncle andf hes the best singer in he wrld
3,Learning How To Play...,I think that is the best video instruction I've seen in quite a while. I tried a number of video instruction systems but I think that Kalani has them beat with this one! I've been playing congas for approximately twenty years and I think Kalani has just about touched on some of the major rhythms that are played along with the history.
5,Great resource for parents,"Rev. Haffner is on the mark with this book, and I recommend it highly. Her commonsense approach encourages parents to be their children's primary sex educators and gives them the tools with which to do it."
4,Good information,This is a good book that has information that is relevant for parents from age 0 through the teenage years. An excellent resource to have while your children grow!
5,Memories!!,"I absolutely adore the quality that is still defined for the blue controller I got. It's as if I just went back in time to purchase a brand-new controller, with very minimal scratches.The joystick and all the buttons work very well, 9/10 rating!"
1,CD Sucks,One of the worst cd's I own. I am 56 years old and by far this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I gave my copy away and took it out of my 80gb i-pod and out of my computer. I collect salsa not garbage. My collection is about 500 albums and about 200 cd's.
2,Wonder what I'd do?,"Not having the talent of Junior Gonzalez or Adalberto Santiago, I'll never have to decide when I can't deliver the musical goods to the public anymore. These are my guys but I'm sorry, they're over the hill. Watching most of this DVD till I couldn't take it anymore really made me appreciate the craftsmanship and grace of the cats in Buena Vista Social Club. Perhaps the end of this concert has a big finish featuring Alfredo De La Fe and Nicky Marrero, who still seem to have something to say, but don't ask me 'cause I couldn't hang. Production values are pretty good for this type of disc."
5,Man this is fun.,"My personal favorite entry in the series. The music is flat out awesome, it;s like trance-electronic-dubstep-techno. Combined with the vivid flashing lights this makes for a trippy, fast paced, rave-like arcade experience. Does chug when loading new levels sometimes. The game is awesome, period. If you dig retro arcade games grab it, I doubt you'll regret it."
2,terribly amusing,"the game is maybe not terribly amusing, but amusingly terrible. the gameplay from this game is pretty much the same as the original. the graphics are bright vibrant colours, which are quite fun. the gameplay element is very redundant and gets old fast. it's fun for a level or two but i wouldn't recomend this game for anyone."
4,Ez tetszik!,"Handy and concise. I've used it recently when I had to resolve a difficult dialogue set in a Budapest cafe. One of the characters tries to impress his fellows with his Hungarian and -embarasses himself! But, seriously, 2176 useful Hungarian phrases that fit in your trousers!"
1,Warning! abridged version - only half the original length,"Dammit - I wish I had read the reviews more carefully - this is so badly abridged that if you don't know the story already it is very difficult to follow. I have wasted my money on this, and will now have to buy the full version."
3,Mahabharata,"Poor quality VHS. Topic is superb, acting was excellent and the overall production was terrific. Just the quality of the video wasn't up to my expectations."
1,CUT VERSION!,"I have been eagerly awaiting Peter Brooks' The Mahabharata on DVD, and today it arrived. How disappointed I was to find this version is a little over half as long as the one shown on the BBC and PBS. I have not watched this version yet, but I cannot believe it will be anything but a slice-and-dice version of the epic tale that I came to love in its television miniseries form and later on laserdisc. So a warning to everyone: if you want the full miniseries, THIS IS NOT IT!"
1,Sliced & Diced!,"This is a disappointing, sliced and diced version of the long epic shown on public television many years ago. The cuts change the storyline and make it difficult to follow, especially in reference to the amazing 5+ hour original.Buyer beware! This is not the original, full length version."
1,"Previously on...""The Mahabharata""","I was disappointed when this version came out that people were being negative about it without even purchasing it. I didn't heed their warning and purchased it anyway.We live in a great age. We can get complete seasons of television shows. We can get movies with hours of behind the scene footage that enhance the experience. With all of these great things, why would a company abridge a great work like this? The six hour version was already abridged from the nine hour play. The nine hour play was abridged from a 5000 page book.I tried to watch this version but I felt like I was seeing a flashback episode of a TV series.We all have been awaiting a re-release of the six hour version. This is an insult to a great work."
3,"critique of ""Mahabharata""","Peter Brook omitted very important parts of the story. As children, the Kauravas plotted to kill the Pandavas, by luring them into a lac house and burning it down. The Pandavas and their mother escaped and wandered in the forest for many years. Before this occurred, Duryodhan poisoned Bhima and threw him into the sea, where Bhima was rescued by underwater creatures. The Kauravas were treacherous, and this has not been pointed out by Peter Brook. Showing these events could have taken perhaps another ten minutes of screen time. This is a distorted story. S.K. Madireddi"
1,an abysmal failure,"I was completely disappointed by this Mahabharata. To compress this work into five + hours too many significant events had to be left out and the story as told here is unintelligible, even for someone versed in Hindu philosophy. The acting is stilted, amateurish and completely unbelievable. I have no idea what such a talented director as Brook was thinking when he created this work, but it is an abysmal failure."
4,great game for nintendo 64!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it's a good game but since it's from nintendo 64 the graphics aren't too good but good for nintendo 64. you can set traps for other players like a portable hole. I would highly reccomend this game for a person who likes Mario Cart or other non-lifelike racing games because it's pretty fun except for the not so great graphics but good for nintendo 64. The educational is bad but no video games have really good educational value (who cares if you learn from it it's all about the fun right?!!) the durabilities not good because it's for a ""home entertainment system"""
4,Adaptable but heavy,I like it. It does what it is supposed to do. I hate lugging it and I hate folding it back up. But I couldn't do without it.
1,"DON'T BE FOOLED, MADE IN CHINA","December 2012 , Now all Little Giant Ladders are made proudly in CHINA. Quality is down and BBB complaints are up. Company is soon to be out of business and unloading ladders for cheap. Good luck with the warranty."
2,poorly printed,"Quality control in the making of this book was very poor. When compared with the outstanding clarity of the original Railway Clearing House maps, the reproduction in this book makes the atlas not worth the bother. A serious attempt to produce a useful book would also have used a larger scale. If the reader is looking for a good historical railway atlas, hunt down a copy of Jowett's railway atlas. You wont get better than that."
4,Great Book,"Let me tell you I got this book because I have started a new lifestyle, getting fit and eating healthy. I needed to make sure I was covering all ends. This book is such a great guide to perfect health, my mom is a type 2 dieabetic and I learned such much about foods she can eat, and how they can help her. Such a good book for self education."
3,Mario kart double dadh,My son really wanted this game and even though it was previously owned it was in good shape and came to us pretty promptly.
1,USELESS!!!!!,You don't need this guide to beat this game. You can figure what you can unlock by yourself. I beat this game without the guide. Don't get this guide unless you're horrible at this game!
3,"Not her 2d album, actually","Can't disagree much with the previous reviewer, alas, but ""Epiphany in Brooklyn"" wasn't Brenda's first album. That was ""Goldfish Don't Talk Back,"" which if anything is a stronger album than ""Epiphany."""
4,Fast & fun read for the Chicken addicted...,"What can I say that other reviewers havent? This book is a charming and quirky memoir. The author writes in a comical & at times sarcastic way & you'll find yourself chuckling along with her. I found myself looking forward to being able to sit down and read more of this tale!As a backyard chicken mom myself- I understood just how Catherine' chickens gave her strength and brought her & her daughter through a very tramatic and stressful time.Overall, this book is a fast, fun and touching read. The only thing I didn't like was one comment where she was using Jesus' name in vain & when her daughter was bragging about how she was ""agnostic"" in front of a preacher. I really didn't see how these comments added to this lovely book. Otherwise, I enjoyed this book immensely."
3,'twas cute,"This is a cute, beach-type book. Doesn't take much concentration to read it - though the author tries to insert a few insights here and there. It is interesting enough to hold concentration, and there are a few smiles along the way...."
2,Is There Still Life with Chickens???,"I very much wanted to like this book. I live on the South Shore in MA, and knew of all the places about which the author wrote. Even though I share some of the same opinions of each town in which she and her daughter lived, I felt the author's analysis of the towns and her experiences in them were shallow and predictable. I wanted depth and to care - really care - about the characters, but, alas, I never did."
2,Overrated,"The book did start out promising; however, the author lost me when she claimed the subject's daughter wore a live snake in her braid for an entire year. Puleeeeze"
3,light reading,"My book group agrees, this was pretty light. If you're looking for an easy read after a more intense book, this is fine.We follow the author in transitions - post-(amicable)divorce, adjusting teenage daughter, downsizing her house, and embarking on what it takes to keep 6 chickens through all this over the course of a year that includes a cold, snowy Boston winter.There's not a lot below the surface....."
3,Thank goodness for chickens,"This is a quiet book, do not expect excitement or revelations. The author is lucky enough to have an amicable divorce and, while left ""poor"" enough to have to sell off her big house in an upscale neighborhood, she then has plenty of money to hire repairmen to renovate her new neglected cottage with the beautiful big view. This is a story of the mundane details of living in a work-in-progress and raising some chickens, but the author is a good writer and gives a lovely sense of place out on the wild Northeast coast and a good-natured review of the trials of living in the midst of repair with a somewhat eccentric teen. I especially loved her chickens and learned a great deal about their care. Anyone dreaming of life with chickens should read this before buying. I found this to be a pleasant read about starting a new life, but thought the chickens, the scenery and the weather were the best part."
4,Good book,I bought this book because I have pet chickens. The story was great and I really related to the chicken stories.
3,Movie was OK..music was pretty bad,This movie was OK. The Girl on Girl action could have been hotter though. And the music got on my nerves really nad. It sounded like the music was created with a $5 dollar synthesizer
2,Boring,"The photographs are excellent, all black and white of course, but the writing style is boring.I have read a small portion of the book. My other books on ballet include Massine's autobio,Ballet Russes costumes, Ballet Russes ..., Diagilev books, Nijinsky's diary, Baranova's autobio,Danilova's bio ... Of all my books, about 13, this is the most boring. However, if I had a choiceof buying it again, I would because of the photographs.Of course, the excerpt from Pavlova's autobiograpghy is the most interesting part of the book.I have ordered a copy of that book."
3,typical n64 fighting game,"mace is a weapon based fighting game. it seems pretty uninspired for the most part. i think it was trying to be something different than other fighters out on the market at the time, however it was not any better than the others. as for weapons based combat, soul caliber it is not. you just hack and slash slowly and ungracefully until one of you wins. i wouldn't recomend this game, unless you really love fighting games."
2,an okay game,this game was okay not one of the best fighting games i've played but it was okay. the characters are hard to controll and it's hard to make them do thier specail moves. but it's okay for a try i wouldn't buy it.
4,Kaze No Stigma,This anime is good. I enjoyed it on Youtube. I do not know if those 2 ever get together. It will be interesting. the only thing was bite sad was the girl from his past. When he foud out the last thing she think about him. It was a bite mix feeling.
4,A solid action/adventure,"Kazuma is a wind magic user with a hard past. Ayano is his cousin and a fire magic user. They both have difficult personalities and don't get along. A demon from Kazuma's past has unleashed hell on Tokyo. To stop him Kazuma and Ayano must learn to get along.This title is full of action and adventure. There is some pretty solid character development too. The animation and the soundtrack are also pretty good. Kaze No Stigma is a lot of fun to watch and has some very memorable characters. It's not the best anime out there, but it's a solid 4 stars."
5,Not Bad......,Really enjoy this series. It has a fairly good plot and the interaction between the two main characters is a lot of fun to watch. (Not to mention a father's behind the scenes manipulation of them both.) Really reccommend this series.
5,Great extenders,"These extenders are great for my dogs prong collar. She needs the extenders because she is not a small dog, but she really doesn't need those giant prongs. These are 2.5mm gauge wire."
4,extra room,"This was bought as an add on....when the dog growes, we add this on so we don't have the expense of a new collar.... High quality, works well, we think..."
2,for poor circulation in legs,does not work that great - as it is described.Very disappointed in the itemwould not buy it again.
4,"A good solid jack, but made in China.",If you want one made in the USA buy one from Shelby industries. I found them after I purchased this one from China.
1,DID NOT RECEIVE ALL PARTS,"Over 1/2 of parts were missing!!!! Hopefully Amazon will send me a NEW one, instead of an OPENED BOX with NO bolts or screws.. and other MAJOR parts were missing! i don't know who returned this one, but Amazon should have examined it.. There were not even instructions with it.. .... blah.. blah.. blah..."
5,The Best Joe Diffie Album Yet,"This album is by far the best stuff that Joe Diffie has ever done, even if you aren't a fan of his music you have to get this album just for two songs. ""In another world"" and ""My give a dam's busted"" very good quality stuff but look for a few more tracks on this album to be released on radio in the near future for your listening enjoyment. I bought this album when it first came out and I don't regret doing that, so go get it."
5,The Daughters of the Moon Series by Lynn Ewing,This series is so exciting I had trouble doing anything but reading. I did not realize there are 13 books in this series but each book was worth reading and I know I will read this series again. Because there are 13 books I decided to do a review on the series as a whole and not each book individually .The characters were each intriguing in their own way and more exciting when teamed. I wish this series continued only because it was such a joy to read.
5,"Oohhh, chills!","Woww!!! I just finished this and I'm staggered. Not only was The Becoming well written and suspensful, it has a few revelations and an ending that will knock you off your feet!I know a lot of people don't like Tianna, but I promise this book will change your mind. You will be literally scared of what will happen to the poor girl, and shocked at her true identity...Hope I haven't said too much!"
4,"there will NOT BE A THIRTEENTH book, but...","To find out what happens after the twelth book, read the Sons of the Dark series (also by Lynne Ewing)--they show up in the third book, and it answers your questions on hwat became of the daughters of the moon, i just thought you should know, since so many of you are wondering. ^__^"
3,Jamestown as it was known in the 1940s,I didn't realize when I ordered this book that it was written in the 1940s. A lot of research has gone on in Jamestown and about the era since then and i was hoping that this tome would bring that to life. However it is a good introduction to what happened in the first 17 years and I am continuing to read it. I had ancestors who were in Virginia during the first 17 years and some of them are mentioned but there was nothing new for me about them. And that was basically what I was looking for. This book was written for visitors to Jamestown who wanted a background on the time. It is well done. But new material needs to be integrated or newly written to include in such an introduction.
1,What a load of hoo-hah,"I wish I could have rated this as no stars... or negative stars. ""Good Catholic Girls"" are Mary, the Mother of God, Mother Theresa, St. Clare, St. Therese. They are not the whining bunch of pagan, pseudo-Catholics listed in this book. These are people who are de facto no longer Catholic. They simply choose to continue to call themselves Catholic because they don't want to just disagree with the Church and go their own way, they want to tear it down and turn it into their own feminized, neo-pagan wacko cult.They are not succeeding. Orthodox Catholicism is growing. People with the ideology that this book espouses are not. They're silly. Their theology is goofy, unattractive, and weird... aside from being wrong. Nobody's falling for it anymore. The sixties are over. They write books for their own little in-crowd... which is shrinking.I wouldn't waste my time on this one."
5,Revealing,"Good Catholic Girls is a beautifully written book based on views held by a wide spectrum of catholic women. It is especially interesting to pay attention to where Catholicism is growing the fastest, especially in Africa. DISCIPLES OF FORTUNE mirrored some of the paths taken to reconcile the Church's role in the complicated worlds of the faithful."
1,What a Drag it is Getting OOOOOLLLLLLDDDD!,"Unfortunately for Angela, the liberal progressive movement will die out with the aging, gray, wrinkled, decrepit old feminists. There has been tremendous growth in the Church with the youth who are 100% loyal to God's Church. The liberal orders of nuns are dying off with no one to care for the aged. The orthodox orders have so many young women that they beg for money to feed and house all of them.What is dying out is ""progressive"" catholicism--My Own Version of Catholicism. True Catholicism is on the up swing.This book is the usual tripe."
1,The Truth Will Set You Free,"But, like that guy who is mentioned in the Creed said: ""What is Truth?""Someone else said, ""I am the Way, the Truth and the Life..""Will you like this book? Chances are you will if:You are an aging boomer who misses the Age of Aquarius.You still think that feminists have some kind of ""new"" information that really just might raise your consciousness.You are quick to anger.You had a teacher who was a nun in habit when you where a kid who hit you with a ruler...and you still use that as an excuse why you don't go to mass.You aren't pro-life.You think Tradition is ""mean"".You don't know - or understand why - the mot perfect human ever to exist is the Blessed Virgin Mary.If you have said yes to one or more of these questions, feel free to enter the echo-chamber of neo-pagan gnosticism. But don't say I didn't warn you."
5,A must read for every Catholic,"Trying to change the male bastion that is the Catholic Church seems to be an impossible task. And one wonders, why bother? Bongavoglia's book makes it clear why the Church needs to be changed and how women are leading the way. Her stories are of courage, determination, faith and perseverance. They are inspiring. You find yourself routing for these brave women. Bonavoglia brings to light a movement and movements within the Church of which most everyday Catholics are unaware but should be. Having come of age during Vatican II I was happy to know that the fight to bring the Church into the modern world is still being fought. A must read for Catholics and anyone caring about the role of women in the world."
1,Excommunication,"Maybe before Angela wrote such a terrible book she should have really dug into Catholicism instead of her own self-righteousness. What about the Mother of God??? The Tabernacle of Christ. Our Co-Redemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate. Totus Tuus Maria???? The book is tired old propaganda. If she truly knew Catholicism she'd know that it never changes."
5,Dignity Restored,"Bonavoglia's interviews of ""good Catholic girls"" vivify a sweeping panorama of women in the Church from the ancient to our gifted present. What we hear seems to rest and grow on the obscure and the obscured, the silenced and the banned, until we recognize the bold stillness of a mountain revealed. Recent events in the the Roman Catholic Church beg the unanswerable question - how might things have been different? Bonavoglia puts much to rest in this invaluable recap of who stays, what they are doing and where they are taking the rest of us. The women we meet are not leaving the Church and yet they are not staying--they are changing the Church while their work moves and alters everything and everyone it passes. Write on, Angela!Peggie L. Thorp, Boston, MA"
5,Good Catholic Girls Gives Reason for Hope,"I loved the book Good Catholic Girls: How Women Are Leading the Fight to Change the Church. An employee at our neighborhood bookstore called me because she thought I would like it and I do. All my heroines are there. I love her writing style and her message. She gives hope to me and other women like me who are so tired of being second-class citizens in the Catholic Church, and yet who love the Church and have no intention of leaving it, no matter how deplorable the leadership gets. I thank the author for being brave enough to say what needed to be said."
2,So So Product,"We ordered two of these to use during a Night under the Stars at a State Park, only red lights were allowed and not knowing if we would do anything like this again I didn't want to spend too much money, I didn't go for the cheapest light but one on the mid range. One of them worked fine, the other one was terrible. One of them would not stay put on the brightest setting and kept going down to nearly nothing. We plan do to more of these so I will do some research and find a better product. I personally would not recommend this product."
1,Super CHEAP,i don't know what i expected for $12. but this has to be the cheapest flashlight i've ever encountered. the lens falls right off while holding and there is a death blade of a glass lens that becomes free to lacerate anyone near by. The two red LEDs are the kind you get from radio shack for a nickel each. and the potentometer that controls the intensity does not operate correctly as the lights flicker a lot while adjusting their brightness. i cannot recommend this light to anyone as i am very disappointed in its quality.
1,Not worth it,"Hi, I purchased this flashlight based on Celestron being a brand that knows about night time. The light from the two LED's is very weak. Yes, it is red, but after this light being completely not enough for the work I was doing, I got some red gel and put it over a flash light. THAT was fine.Too small, underpowered and over priced. Skip this product."
1,Not what I expected,"I was expecting this flashlight to be an infrared flashlight, but it was just a red led light bulb. Nothing special, not really the sellers fault. Perhaps I should have read the description more carefully."
5,Night Vision Light,I like the features of this night vision flashlight. It has a rotating wheel to adjust the amount of light you need plus it runs on a 9 volt battery which is cheap and easy to find. My last night vision light required very expensive button batteries and cost more than the light itself. It comes with a strap to hang around your neck so it is always handy when you are out in the dark observing the night sky.
2,Cheaper then cheap,"I purchased this flashlight thinking it would be a perfect little item for observing without destroying my eyes. It is a terrible flashlight, it doesn't show almost anything unless it is on full power, and it is the cheapest made thing I have ever held in my hand. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy one of these. I took it apart and the internal components are just junk. The outer shell is a very flexible plastic that could easily break if you tried. The light if dropped would implode in my opinion. I have used it and it was slightly helpful, hence the two stars. Save your money though and buy something that actually works as it is intended. The quality control team at Celestron needs some pointers."
3,Telescope Flashlight,This is a very nice red beam flashlight. If I would add anything it should be a little brighter. Well worth the money though.
2,It's two red LEDs and a dial in a plastic box,"I'm not sure why this product is so expensive. It's just a couple LEDs, some batteries, and a brightness control. I think a review often can be on the subject of ""getting what you paid for"" and I have to say that I paid for much more than what I received. It does work, but I would not buy this again."
4,Nailed this one!,"The Production values are a little scant, and the first ten minutes I viewed with some unease. Gazing over at my Amazon receipt hoping it said: ""used"". BUT! As the film marched on fear was replaced with admiration. This great storyline was not wasted. The director does a terrific job of creating an intense psychological atmosphere. I was impressed at the way my biggest criticism (low budget) ended up giving it a certain charm. The primitive element of the presentation added layers of animated paranoia. This movie does not take itself seriously and there is an element of humor that carries throughout. There are some bonus psychedelic visuals that are artfully presented also. I don't know, Maybe I'm just a sucker for a guy hammering nails into his head. But I would be very interested to see more from this young Russian director."
3,"Great, but mine didn't last","These memory foam pads in general are wonderful, and after getting one for my parents, I bought this one for myself. Although it was great at first, mine seems to be sagging in the middle. I am using it on a futon, so it may be that the futon mattress is not as firm as a regular mattress, and that is what is causing it. So I'm not sure if it is my saggy-in-the-middle mattress, or if the pad itself is starting to sag. At any rate, this started probably a month after I started using it, and it is definitely not the same quality as the one I got my parents. So it probably isn't necessary to buy the most expensive one, but there is definitely a difference, and this one is not super high quality."
4,good high power eyepiece,this eypiece is an excellent choice for someone who wants a high power eyepiece that's inexpensive. The images are surprisingly clear and is definetally worth the money. My only complaint is with most inexpensive high-power eypieces is the small eye relief. I would recommend an eyepiece that has larger eye relief like a lanthanum eyepiece to anyone who can compfortably afford the higher price.
1,Over priced,"This book is over priced. And, the poems are average. My 8 years old kid asked why I wasted money and time on this book. I don't know why other people gave it high marks. This book is definitely a waste of money."
5,Extraordinary!,"This is an extraordinary recording. Every song is top-notch. I was literally glued to my seat listening to every note and lyric until I had listened to the CD in it's entirety. It's rare that ANY recording can hold my attention like that. Susan Egan's poignant rendition of, ""I Hate to See You Go"" brought tears to me eyes. And at the same time, there are songs like, ""Them"" ,that made me laugh out loud. This is a great CD. The songs are great. The artists are great. (Adryan Russ actually sings a song herself. Her voice is GORGEOUS!) The arrangments are BEAUTIFUL. The world is definitely going to hear more of Adryan Russ. So, buy this CD while you can still get a copy!!!!!"
4,"So much fun, I laughed out loud!","This album is filled with songs that were such fun, i found myself laughing out loud. This CD also has some great ballads featuring Susan Egan and Tami Tappan and others which truly sent shivers up my arm. If you are a big broadway fan, this album is for you. I really wish Tami Tappan would do an album of her own. Her voice is so lovely, every note she carries out with such perfection. Can't get enough of Tami Tappan!!!"
5,Fantastic!,"This CD is a wonderful surprise! Adryan's music is a superb mix of energetic show tunes, to poignant love songs. My only disappointment is that Adryan sings only one of her songs. She has a rich and melodious voice, and deserves a CD of her very own."
4,A Book For Older Teens,"Lucky is a story that describes how cruel people can be. The author tells us how he thinks we should deal with such cruelty. This is a young adult novel that shows us love has no labels. It is easy for teens to relate to what the author is saying. I would not recommend this book to children, but to very mature teenagers. It would be a little hard to understand being a younger child. This book is easy for teens to relate to what the author is saying. It is an interesting, well written book that tells teenagers to look past labels and find the true personality of a person. Although a young adult novel, it demands that the readers have a mature outlook on life. The story offers a means of opening discussions with teens about sexuality."
3,lucky bye eddie de oliveira,"Ever wonder if you wern't straight? Sam did. All his life he had a funny feeling he wasn't like everyone else and that he might be bisexual. He had been scared for so long to tell anyone about his ""confused gut"" until he met a bisexual named Toby. Toby and him started to get close as friends because they could share their problems. Sam also feels feelings for Toby and he starts to realize he may like him more than a friend.Everything was going great with them until Toby met a girl named Lucy and they started dating. When this happens , Sam realizes that he really does want Toby more than a friend and that he probably should talk to him. will he get the courage to talk to his ""close friend?"" Will he ever figure out his ""confused gut?"" I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good dramatic book and i would totally read this book again. *ashley*"
4,A wonderful way to explain what dyslexia is to a child,"As an academic language therapist, I looked for a book that explained the process of diagnosing and treating dyslexia to children in a non-threatening way. I found many books that were appropriate for parents and adults, but few picture books for children. The illustrations in this book are delightful! The children that I have read this story to have enjoyed it. After the story, we were able to discuss how the child was like the main character, Charlie. I would recommend this to anyone who is beginning to deal with children with dyslexia."
4,Note from the author,"When Ann Root and I started looking for children's books that explain learning differences to a child, we were not able to find many in 1995. So, we decided to write a special needs children's book that would help a young child understand what a learning difference is. Our gifted illustrator, Ann Nelson Sweat, created pictures that are whimsical and appealing. We know that children with learning differences are bright, but they process information in a different way. This book is a tool that parents can use with young children to help them understand their strengths and weaknesses. As a parent recently told me, ""My son identified with Charlie and his feelings about school."" Let's all keep advocating for these bright, creative children with a different learning style! To our friends, thanks so much for your support.Linda Gladden"
4,Kanechiwa! Awesome game!,"I think is a great one and has the best graphics are the best, such as the same with the excellent story line. It is a mario history lesson basically and is about the only game that uses the c-buttons as something besides camera views. With hours of fun play with 4 characters and magic spells, this is a keeper!"
5,An Old Game That Didn't Disappoint,"The game arrived sooner than expected. It was of great quality, and ran like a dream when I played it immediately after arrival. This was definitely one of my top 5 favorite games about 10 years ago, and I had hoped it would still be an enjoyable experience while also nostalgic. I'm happy it's still fun after all these years."
5,An Amazing Classic,"For anyone who loves a good adventure RPG, this game is for you. It's got a great sense of comedy that keeps you going in the game. The gameplay is great and the controls are great. My only pet peeve is the camera control in the game, but very few games from the early N64 era had anything close to good camera control. Regardless of that this is still one of my favorite games."
1,No title,"This performance of the Passion is superb but the DVD would not run on my Panasonic player. Are all American discs incompatible with UK models? Is this a case of 'caveat emptor'. aokmovies, the suppliers, were excellent."
3,Fighter's Destiny,"Date of Review April 2000 I'd say fighters are my favourite games. I love the Street Fighter Series, Tekken, and Soul Caliber. Fighter's Destiny with it's blocky ugly graphics is surprisingly very fun. It's not the coolest fighter with a goofy announcer, a fighting cow, ugly sound, stereotypical uncreative characters, and lousy arenas. But it's innovative point system is cool, and MANY different modes will hook ya. If you've never played this. It's definetely worth a rent or if you can get it cheap get it. DON'T GET IT NEW!"
3,Cendyne CDRW are like a box of chocolate,"Cendyne CDRW are like a box of chocolate, you never know what you're going to get. These are repackaged drives from various manufacturers from Liteon to Panasonic to MSI. If you're lucky you're get a liteon drive which are pretty decent. If you're not lucky you'll end up with a MSI drive that will be really noisy beyond belief (feel like your pc tower is about to blast off into outerspace). That will explain why some people might absolutely love their cendyne and some will absolutely hate theirs. Good luck!"
2,Think twice before buy this drive or any CenDyne product!,"I bought a Verbatim drive (48x12x48) which according to Verbatim's tech support is a re-badged CenDyne. I also picked a CenDyne DVD-ROM. What a mistake!The CD-RW drive with Nero Burn works on CD-R, but not any CD-RW. I tried different brand CD-RW such as HP, TDK, even Verbatim, but I always got the ""Medium Speed Error"". The same disc will work in my old TEAC CD-RW drive, which by the way is always quiet and reliable.The DVD drive is noisy and the disc will have rattling noises at high speed even though the same disc won't make a sound in my TEAC CD-RW drive or NEC CD-ROM drive.Anyway, for my next drive, I am definitely going back to some decent brand such as NEC or TEAC."
1,worked for 20 days and quit,"Purchased drive 12/02 for transferring data files only. Quit working approx 20 days later. Loud vibration and would no longer recognize any blank media. Will still read a CD, on occasion--you guess when. No company support via email after three emails. No 1-800 number and must DIG to find toll number for tech support which so far has not produced a result. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRIVE unless you enjoy pain."
1,Recieved message from company they are out of business,I bought a cendyne cd rw 48x12x48 last December. I never could get it to write. It quick working completely at 5 months. I contacted the customer service number which referred me to their website. The message I recieved is that they are going out of business and will not honor anymore warranties. This cd rw was a waste of my money.
1,Drive can be of Several Mfg,"the one i got was model 4618P, which is a crappy Acer(Benq) drive. there have been many reports on the variations of models, and therefore problems associated with this drive. for instance, my Benq is actually a 48x16x48...but dont let that 16x speed dupe you into thinking it's a good deal; unless it's the LTR (lite-on) model, i'd return the item (should say on the back of the box what model)....i didnt check then, and i'm regretting it now, as this stupid drive burns tons of coasters..."
5,Terribly sad,"This is one of the saddest movies that I have ever seen in my life, and I love drama. It is a great story of a love that can never be in a world of Czarist Russia. Wonderfully acted, with some of Russia's greatest actors of that time in lead roles. A profound work of movie making, which leads to question society as a whole."
5,A cruel Romance,"ITS A VERY SWEET MOVIE AND HAVE GOOD ACTORS. I LOVE THE MUSIC, THE DRAMA AND THE PHOTOGRAPHY ABOUT RUSSIAN."
2,Pass on this,Not what I expected. Would not reccommend this to any Freestyle fan. Move on to other titles when looking to buy a Freestyle compilation.
3,Forever Freestyle CD,CD is good however the case it was in was cracked. Not packaged well I don't know. Product did arrive on time.
3,Not Bad but Just Average,"This 2-disc set gets repetative after a few minutes of listening. With the acception of about 5 songs, all of them on here sound very similar. It gets monotonous."
3,Great Find!,Met someone that told me about this book. Read it in two days. Truly underrated and a great read. Loved the characters and story line. Interesting story.
3,It makes coffee,It makes coffee just fine and I can't complain about that. The white color was a mistake as it is very hard to keep clean. The big problem I have with this model is that it does not shut itself off after a designated time period. I'd pay the extra money and get the next model up that has a timer on it... and in a different color!
2,Way under average coffeemaker !,"I bought this coffeemaker after the carafe from my old coffeemaker broke believing that this will prevent future accidents.This coffeemaker does make coffee but it has several disadvantages. First thing is that after only a couple of usage the stains inside out is impossible to get cleaned. The second and the most annoying problem is that you can't go cup wise with this machine. In other words, when it shows in the capacity window that it has 2 cups left from that point on it is impossible to get a clean cup of coffee without dripping from the machine itself on the cabinet and floor and everywhere. It is a disaster. Also, What I don't like about it is that you always have to do guesswork about how much water you already added to machine since the reservoir of it does not have the measurement window. Overall, I don't like this machine and am looking forward to go back to a good carafe based coffeemaker soon."
2,Don't like the plastic taste,"I love the idea of this coffeemaker but from the first pot of coffee it has had a very bad plastic taste. I have cleaned the ""pot"" with baking soda, white vinegar, put it in the dishwasher, and washed it numerous times and the coffee still has a horrible plastic taste. After it sits awhile the taste is worse and I've had to throw out a lot of coffee. It does drip usually just one drip after you dispense a cup but that's not really a problem. The pot that the coffee sits in should be made of or at least lined in glass or stainless steel. I would gladly pay extra for that. This morning I tossed it in the trash after having to throw out a whole pot of coffee that tasted horrible. I wrote Proctor Silex 4 times about this with no response. No more Proctor Silex for me."
2,Fails the key test,"While the design features and general ideas behind this brewstation are well founded, the key test for a coffee maker is simple. Can it make good coffee?Sadly, no. This model produces batch after batch of nigh undrinkable coffee. Coffee so bitter and burnt that I end up throwing it away. In addition, all of the other comments about staining, poor measuring, etc. - ring absolutely true.Two stars for the effort. Hard to get higher when it can't perform the basic task around which it is designed."
4,great purchase,I have this coffee maker for over a year and it is great. some of the reviewers say its hard to clean..its not I just place mine in the dishwasher once a week and it is very clean. Still they should make this model in black. I am so glad I don't have to clean up broken glass when a carafe breaks first thing in the morning. And the coffee comes out super fast. This is one purchase I don't regret. BUY it!!
3,It's OK,I only bought this BrewStation because it was the only white coffee maker I could find that didn't have a glass pot. It's much more flimsy than the Hamilton Beach BrewStations I've purchased in the past. The price was a little high considering it doesn't have an automatic timer.
5,Very Good Liturgical Resource,"This book is excellent for Liturgical use. A ""Must Have"" resourse for for any parish, school, or community that's tryng to foster Eucharistic Adoration and Worship."
1,Very poor quality,"This journal doesn't look like that on the picture. The colours are darker and there is an elastic band wrapped around it. The quality is extremely poor, although the colours are nice. There is not enough space to write comfortably inside it, either."
4,Where would you like to be?,"As the year 2000 approaches, the world is gearing up for the biggest party of the century where would you like to be? Thousands of parties are being planned - tens of millions of dollars are being spent on fireworks alone for the moment the clock strikes twelve. Dawn ceremonies will flourish across the world and this wonderful pocket guide not only gives information on stimulating locations (by country, then city or site) for celebrating New Years 1999/2000 but has other informative sections that deal with FAQ regarding the millennium (countdown clocks, correct year, Y2K - the millennium time bomb?, etc.), list web sites, millennium tour groups, books and gives a short history of the millennium. Recommended."
2,Web site references poorly researched,"Bought this to find interesting web sites, but 90% of those recommended either no longer existed or nowhere near lived up to their write up."
4,Another undiscovered jewel!,"IT's a pity this isn't better known. As others have said, it's not only one of Barymore's finest performances on film (surpassing even Grand Hotel! His character here is not made super-noble or villainous, but simply and believeably human, not an easy thing for an actor to achieve), but a wonderful commentary, on several levels, of the fortunate and not-so-fortunate members of society at the peaking of the Depression. Some of it even holds true today. The scenery is superb down to the last detail, the direction and camerawork are razor-sharp, and the acting is just about perfect in every role, even the bits. So why only 4 stars? The film's only flaw, albeit a tiny one, is that the otherwise super-snappy dialogue gets a little stagy at times. Still, this pales next to the mivoe as a whole. A keeper!"
5,Great introduction to tooning!,I use this as an introduction and overview with my JH and SH students. It summarizes the art of sequential storytelling and includes the basics of what you need to tell a good story. Jo Wos also discusses the history of symbolic imagery and how the use of symbolic imagery is used to move a story along. He explains the role of animals in cartooning and the importance of facial features and expressions. His delivery is dynamic and contemporary This video has been a success with my teenage students.
3,DVDs did not have the closed caption feature working :(,"Although I am not old or deaf (60 yrs old with moderate hearing loss), I have begun using closed captioning when watching tv. None of the dvds of any season I ordered had the closed caption feature working. I know my tv has it as I use it all the time now, and have watched other dvds that had it. All 4 seasons I bought here did not. It was disappointing as when you begin to have hearing loss, listening to foreign accents become even more difficult to understand.I was very disappointed. The picture quality was excellent, but since I had trouble understanding the audio, it took alot of joy out of it for me."
5,The Tudors 3rd Season,This is an awesome series and I wasn't able to watch it all on Showtime. I am so happy to have this complete 3rd season.Thanks so much!
4,Enjoyable - especially for fans of Seasons 1 and 2,"I must admit that I don't have cable, but I enjoyed this series from Showtime so much that I bought the seasons sets on dvd to watch and enjoy at home in my spare time. I enjoy the series very much. I don't expect complete historical accuracy unless it's a documentary. PBS and other networks can better be expected to be historically accurate than Showtime. That having been said, most people will enjoy the story, characters, and plots in this series. If you like renaissance festivals, you will likely enjoy this as well. If you like a series of programs rather than a movie - this is for you. I'm glad I have the seasons on dvd. I would be disappointed having to wait week to week for the next episode or worse yet a few weeks between episodes like happen on tv and cable. With the set on dvd I can watch them one right after the other and enjoy hours of escape from life. Yes - I recommend the series."
3,Least Favorite Season,"I'm still glad I bought it, but the first two seasons were better. The first two seasons also had more shows per DVD then the 3rd season did. So - you're paying the same for fewer shows for Season 3. But - I'm addicted to this Series so I HAVE to feed my habit! :)"
2,Why the rush?,"This has been an incredible show...until now. At this point King Henry is older, fat, and in ill health from his leg injury. The leg injury shows up, but then disappears, then reappears, then disappears.... The entire season was rushed. Why? It has about 100 minutes LESS than previous seasons. WHY? I bought the DVD and feel that i was cheated. The story moved too fast with too little explanation about why things were happening. Cromwell has been a vital character and he was sentenced and executed in a flash. What were the producers thinking? Unless things change, i won't be buying the final season."
2,The Tudors - third season,The third season was not as good as season one and two. I was disappointed.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS SEASON 2,The Tudors: Season 3 isn't nearly as good as Season 2. I decided to hold off on purchasing Season 4 because I'm sure that would be a disappointment also.I wish I would have read more customer reviews as I am sure that other viewers felt the same.
3,Feeling a Let-Down,"I was a huge fan of this show, but I must admit I am pretty disappointed in where it is heading. Don't get me wrong, the acting is great and the costumes & settings are wonderful. However, the first two seasons were the highlight of this series. Two seasons with Anne and the pacing was well done. It was pretty awesome. But, then we come to Season 3, which squeezed in a ton of stuff in a very, very short period of time. What did we get, 8 episodes? Now we find out that next season is the final season of the series. Despite how impressive this series began, this is a very sad ending and I'm not sure I'll even watch the final season. I know production was expensive, which is probably the reason for the limited number of episodes, but this is just way, way too short!"
1,Disappointed,"Instead of what I thought I was paying for there is very little Tudors in this set and a lot of filler of some other TV show that I have no interest in watching. Considering the cost I expected more like the first two seasons. The actors are good, the story interesting but the DVD leaves me...Disappointed."
3,Why not Blu-Ray???,"While I like the show and would buy all threee seasons, I don't buy non-high def DVD's. I'll never purchase this series until it is released on Blu-Ray. It was shot in high-def and is shown that way.. Why wait???"
5,Completely entertaining and lavish,I watched the entire series non stop in one day...Like a great book I just couldn't stop watching. I can't wait for season 4 and dread knowing that it is the last :(
4,Must refute statements made in previous review,"While I love The Tudors and fully expect season three to be excellent, I must refute nearly everything that has been said in the previous review. The actor who plays Brandon is Henry Cavill, not Ryan Gellert. While this person may be distantly related to Jane Seymour, the actor Henry Cavill is not. Many people connected with the production of this television series (not film) admit that while the events they depict are based on history they are in no way an accurate portrayal of history, nor are they meant to be. Also, sorry to call you out, but spell check your reviews before they are posted. Incorrect spelling immediately discredits anything you say. I was able to fact check your comments in just a few minutes."
3,Lousy extras,I don't have Showtime. I have obtaining my copies of the Tudors through Amazon Canada. The American has pilot episodes of other Showtime series and very little on the Tudors. I love the series but if I am going to pay for the season I really don't need other programs as extras there have been some wonderful pieces that could have been used.
1,Never got it,"The Tudors, third season never came, and I haven't heard fromthe seller or Amazon. Please contact me."
2,"Show is amazing, what I can see anyways!","Great show, what I can see anyways! Disc one is labeled episodes 1-3 yet only episodes 1 & 2 are available, and disc 2 has 4, 5, and 6. So I got screwed out of episode 3. Would have given the show 5 stars, but not being able to see a majorly pivotal episode really screws up my enjoyment of a show, and I cant seem to get into watching it anymore after that, so I havent seen the rest of the season."
3,GOT STUNG ON PRICE!,"I PRE-ORDERED THIS DVD AND WAS QUOTED A PRICE OF $26.49 WHICH I PAID. I NOW SEE AMAZON IS SELLING THIS DISK FOR $22.99. WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF PRE-ORDER WHEN IT ENDS UP COSTING ME APPRO. $4 MORE? AS A LONG-TERM CUSTOMER I AM FEELING ""HAD""! BUMMER!"
2,great series- not so great season,"I love the Tudors but was very disappointed in this season. It didn't grab me like the other seasons. I took a course in college on the Tudors so I know the story very well. All of the actors did a great job, I just didn't feel as invested in some of them."
3,The Tudors: The Complete Third Season,"The series is fantastic, too bad one of the dvd's had bad sound. Very surprised at this, considering it was a brand new movie set."
4,Not on par with the first 2 but still good,"I love the whole Tudor series however without a doubt this season was indeed the weakest of the 4, however with no fault to the writers or actors, it's just the way history goes. Part of the reason is the departure of Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Although we have Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard, none of them have the presence/longevity Anne Boleyn did. As a result there is no consistent female presence on the show as there was in the first 2 seasons. The second reason is things don't really begin happening until mid-way through the season with the crushing of the Pilgrimage of Grace and the beginning of Thomas Cromwell's downfall. The first part deals with Henry's marriage to Jane and the birth of Edward. Despite all this, the series is still one for all Tudor-fans and the acting, writing is top-notch."
3,Good but not great,"I was extremly excited for season 3 after the 1st 2 seasons, but with the addition of new characters and the, um, beheading of others, I didn't think this season lived up to what it previously was. I was confused by some of the new character who were acting as if they were always on the show. Also there were just some plain boring episodes."
3,Tudors Season3 TV-edition,"I ordered the uncut version that many advertised for $35, but received the normal TV-edition all the time. Good point-contains English Subtitles for the hearing-impaired persons/foreigners, bad point-missing the hot scenes for mature audience.This season 3 contained only 8 episodes on two discs, fewer than seasons 1 and 2.I hope Amazon check out thoroughly the advertisement of Uncut vs TV-editions, to avoid customer-disattisfaction. My understanding is the original Canadian filming is the uncut version, while showing in US and UK for higher moral audience required omitting explicit sexual scenes."
4,Bought used..,"Love the tudors. A bit disappointed in the quality in a ""used- very good"" condition--- the box was pretty tore up."
5,Love the Tudors,"Item got here very quickly, and was in perfect condition.I love everything about it--but you MUST see Seasons 1 & 2 first!"
4,Worth adding to collection Tudors dvd sets.,"The first 2 seasons were better imo....mainly because of the on screen passion between Henry & Anne that is lacking in season 3 between Henry & Jane.Season 3 is worth buying,it is an awesome performance by JRM portraying King Henrys dark period. Their are only 8 episodes this season BUT the bonus shows included justify the price. I hope their will be a season 4 showcasing Mary & Elizabeths reigns as Queens."
5,The Tudors: Complete 3rd season,Love the series. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is brilliant in his role as Henry 8th. Still awaiting word of a 4th season.
5,Great series !,I love this show... I missed half of the first season and the last season...now I can watch it anytime !
5,The Tudors,Bought it as a Christmas present for my Mom! Great afternoon movie! We've seen it before when it first came out but wanted the whole set for her collection. This was the only one we were missing!
3,The Tudors - Season 3,"Love the first two seasons of The Tudors, but I feel season 3 was a bit of a letdown.A few reasons:1)Only 8 episodes instead of 102)No subtitles (I seem to understand the story more when I can read the names and such)3)Not much for special features4)Storytelling seems way more rushedIt's still good TV, but I think the series took a step back."
5,Awesome,Awesome series as usual. Upon completing this season I immediately pre ordered season four and are eagerly awaiting it's arrival. Karen Shirley.
4,henry 8th,"very enjoyable---does not follow the exact history but close enough----in fact it is a good exercise for those of us who love this period of history--the tudors, to recognise the differencs between the tv movie and the real facts---good stuff!"
5,The Tudors - Season Three,We can't wait for the final season DVD's to arrive in our mailbox!We have followed the series closely and read many library bookson Henry the 8th and the people surrounding him. Great historyand fascinating characters. These actors are top notch.
4,Love the series,This is just one of the series I hope to have in my collection. The series really shows England during an exciting time in history. The costumes are magnificent and story lines keep the movie moving.
4,Third season was a bit of a letdown for me.,"We don't get Showtime so I eagerly awaited the third season of the Tudors. The first two seasons enthralled me with their character portrayals, beautiful sets and scenery, and storylines. I watched them over and over. Season three arrived and I watched the whole season in two sittings. I was disappointed that there were only eight episodes, but quality is what counts. I liked season three but it just didn't make me want to watch it again and again. I will watch it again, probably right before I watch season four when it is released. I recommend that Tudors fans not skip this season. The best parts for me were the impact of the Church splitting on the people, Henry's true love for Jane Seymour and the start of his personal decline played so truthfully by Jonathan Rhys Meyers."
5,Fantastic,"As a history buff, I find the series extremely fun to watch. If you slept through history in school, this series will interest you, as it is a sanitized way to learn history about Henry. Henry VIII's role taking a nation to break away from the Catholic Church, and his wives show how one person can forever change the course of history. The artistic license from the writers makes it a fun series, although it is filmed at a castle in Ireland- a country he could never get to fall in line."
1,WHY?,"Why does the Blu-Ray version of the third season of ""The Tudors"" cost $177, while the DVD version costs only $23? Something is wrong with this picture. The low rating is, of course, because of the unbelievably high price."
3,Bad!,This DVD was also badly scratched and my DVD player could not play half of it. So I guess I'll wait for reruns on TV!
4,the tudors boxed set,my wife really likes the tudors so i ordered the boxed set it arrived ahead of the delivery date and worked in our dvd player here in new zealand my wife was delighted !!
5,ShowTime does it again,This review is for both Season 3 & The DVDShowTime does it again. The Tudors is one of the very few cable only TV shows worth watching and the acting is very well done. This DVD set includes the full 3rd season & leaves you wanting Season 4.
5,GREAT!,"I didn't think I would enjoy this season as much as the last, I LOVED Anne, but it was great. JRM just keeps getting hotter."
1,A huge let down,I have all three seasons now and have not gotten thru the first 3 shows of the first year. It is very hard to follow and people keep on popping up out of no where and than dissapear again. It has been a struggle to follow as well as quite boaring. It was my mistake for not reading deeply enough or watching the first season before purchasing the additional 2 seasons. The trailors are a bit misleading.
1,Not for those with a true dairy allergy!,"The recipes in this book are good at avoiding most of the allergens listed and would probably best suit people with allergies to grains, gluten, soy and eggs. I bought this book to cook for my toddler who is allergic to dairy and soy thinking that I could substitute any goat's milk with rice milk, but nearly every main recipe includes goat's CHEESE, for which there is no substitution. Acoording to the Food Allergy Network, 90% of people with a cow's milk allergy also have a goat's milk allergy, so clearly these recipes are not for those people. People with ture dairy allergies need to be very careful wtih this book!"
4,Helpful for wheat allergies,"Good information on how different grains behave when substituting for wheat. Disappointing for Italian recipes. I am allergic to cow's milk, but tolerate buffalo milk mozzarella, which is what it is made of in Italy (Mozzarella di Bufula). The book makes no mention of this important substitution. Also, Pecorino Romano, like imported Feta, is made from sheeps milk, not cow's milk, as stated in the book. Sheeps milk yogurt was not mentioned either. Unfortunate since many people are turned off by the strong taste of goat milk products. Also, some people will tolerate foods that are cooked as some proteins are denatured or broken down by cooking. The book makes no mention of that. Also, some people might not tolerate tomatoes, but can tolerate a mock tomato sauce by pureeing red roasted peppers with or without artichokes as a sauce base. Most of the tomato sauce recipes contained tomatoes. Still the book is very thorough on grain substitutions."
1,Less than 6 allergies? Look at other books first...,"I purchased this book along with at least 3 other books catered to allergies and this was by far the LEAST helpful and worst tasting of the 4. Although it uses flours like arrowroot and quinoa, it lacks enough ingredients to give the foods flavor. Most recipes had less than 4-5 ingredients in them which means you basically taste the bland flour. My kids would rarely eat more than a few bites and they actually like many wheat-dairy-egg-yeast free foods. Shop around before you spend money on this. The only beneficial thing is the explanation of some of the ingredients, where they came from and what family they are in which you can probably find elsewhere."
1,Dont waste your money,"My 16 month old son is allergic to Milk, Soy & Corn and this book was by far the worst I bought. I bought 8 books hoping to find some info and recipies I couldn't find on the internet but the recipies were very exotic and not appropriate for a toddler and were not truely allergin free. I did better at the Food Allergy Network site and should have only bought their cook book."
1,Disappointed in ingredients,I was very disappointed when I found out that this book has various recipes without certain of these ingredient. I was excited about this book because I have all the alergens mentioned. Then when I got the book the recipes only took out some of these ingredients so you could pick the recipes that left out the alergens that you have.The title was very misleading! Because I have all of these alergies I was hoping that all of the recipes were free of these ingredients. I have not found one recipe yet that is free of all the mentioned alergens. I am thinking of sending it back.
2,Good base but not quite,"While it may be true that some people love the foods they can't have, many others can't stand the idea of something that tastes like something they are alleric to. I have many allergies, including cow & sheep's milk, but the thought of touching goat's milk makes my stomach churn. Likewise many of the recipes I saw that were mimicing many popular foods for non-allergic eaters were things that I really wouldn't eat. It's extremely hard to get beyond the mental barrier of the ""fake"" is okay for you but the ""real"" puts you into anaphylactic shock...Also, I found many of the ingredients to be somewhat exotic (at least exotic for northern Ontario) and/or difficult to find here. I really was hoping to find some unique recipes that looked unique for my allgeries including said milk, soy, lentils, gluten, tomatoes and many other foods and spices. Sorry, try again next time."
1,Needs some revisions!,"I was recently diagnosed with several food allergies/sensitivities. I was excited to get this book. Unfortunately, A for effort, but F for product results. The recipes lack flavor and in some cases taste vile. The author never attempted sweeteners for the baking items such as agave nectar or even honey. Not so tasty!"
1,Not really allergy free!!!,"This book has many recipes. But the bread flours mainly consist of Spelt and Kamut flour which both has gluten. There are MANY recipes that call for goat cheese. The title says No Wheat, and dairy free. Yet most recipes have dairy and wheat. The title is deceptive to say the least. This is a regular cookbook with a false title on the book. BEWARE!!Out of 38 recipes in the Muffins, crackers and breakfast foods over 20 recipes contain gluten containing flours. As far as the dairy free, when did goat chesse stop being dairy? I was totally disappointed and shocked that a publisher would publish this book with this title. Its false advertising!!!!"
1,Improper title,"The title implies that there is no gluten in this cookbook, but spelt, one of the main ingredients in the cookbook is high in gluten. The introduction points this out...but who reads the introduction to a cookbook? In fact, the book is sponsored by spelt growers. Trusting that the author knew her stuff, we made spelt bread...and gave it to a boy with a gluten allergy. I'm so glad things weren't worse than they were. But if you buy this book, know that you have to be VERY selective in the recipes you choose and research any ingredients you don't recognize. The author should consider re-titling this book. It's very misleading as it is."
5,THE BEST ALLERGY COOKBOOK EVER!!!,"I have 19 food allergies and can make food that TASTES GOOD. Yes, you do need to get some ""special"" items from the store but the pumpkin pie recipe is heavenly. We have several food allergy sufferers in our family and this makes life simpler and tastier for all."
1,DANGEROUS,"If someone who was well-meaning used a recipe from this cookbook, they could KILL MY CHILD. Dairy includes goat milk products. Most kids with cow milk allergy are also allergic to the protein in goat & sheep milk. And my kid's allergy is anaphylactic, meaning a horrible, suffering death.This book should be re-titled."
1,Confuess with this book,"I am confuses because the cover says ""No wheat, milk, eggs, corn, soy, yeast, sugar, grain, and gluten cookbook"" but yet on page 46 there is a chapter of recipes calling for yeast and there are a few recipes calling for split and rye which are gluten.....if you're going to call a book No Yeast, and Gluten Book well DON""T have recipes in the book calling for those ingredients!!"
2,not what I expected,My son is allergic to soy and milk so I thought I'd give this a try for a birthday cake for him. The recipes are so strange that I will never use it. Almost everything in it has strange ingredients. I just wanted normal everyday recipes...
1,Bad Audio,"I purchased this Korean/US version hoping to get a DVD version of a Hitchcock classic. I don't mind dealing with the multi-language selection defaulting to Korean, but the English soundtrack had so much vibrating, buzzing noise that the movie is absolutely unwatchable. This was disappointing. I would rate this a zero, but Amazon requires at least one star. This was a waste of time and money."
4,WHAT CAN YOU SAY !,"Not much I can say about this T-adapter which isn't much more than a hollow tube, however, much needed to hook up a camera to a spotting scope or telescope. The adapter is made well and does the job that it was made to do for what its worth. Tried to stay with Celestron products to match the scope purchased."
3,T-Adapter,Works fine for what it is proposed to do. However I wish it had a 1x lens to focus onto. Not sure if it was me or the lack of lens but only way i could avoid see the guts of my telescope was to use a Barlow.
4,Durable and works well,"You have to love things that work well and are inexpensive, this is both. I've used a variety of canons with this (rebels, 5d mark II or III)"
2,Unable to focus,"This particular Celestron T-Adapter is too long for my Celestron telescope (their cheapest reflector), making it impossible to focus. On the other hand, the Celestron #93640 T-adapter with Barlow lens worked perfectly. I'm sending this one back, and keeping the #93640."
1,Celestron 93625 Universal 1.25-inch camera adapter,Does not work with Celestron Astromaster 76EQ telescope and Konica-Minolta/Sony digital SLR. Would not focus at all. Might work with other combinations.
4,Worked...with some tweaking,"At first I was totally disappointed after I hooked everything up, because the focal point was incorrect for my Nikon D60. I did some reading, and found out that with reflector telescopes this can happen, but can be fixed by using a Barlow lens to adjust the focal point.After I added a 2x Barlow lens into the mix, then I was able to get pictures. Keep that in mind: if you already have a Barlow, you can likely use that, if not you might be better off getting the version of this with the Barlow built-in."
3,May not fit your scope,"I'd imagine the lens is quite good, but unfortunately the focal length doesn't allow me to take pictures. Please verify that your telescope + camera will accommodate the focal length, or consider getting a different T-adapter with built-in 2"" lens."
5,"Great product, faulty product description","T-adapters can turn your telescope into an amazing telephoto lens and this one will work with any that have a 1.25"" visual back. This piece has a 1.25"" inserting slip connector which replaces the Star Diagonal on your telescope and the title given by Celestron is entirely misleading, it refers to a generic measurement of an inch (actually 1.25""). The faulty description continues in the product description: it WILL NOT FIT .96"" visual backed telescopes such as the Celestron C90, or the Nexstar 4GT. In that case you'll need this partCelestron 93635-A T-Adapter for NexStar 4GTThose telescopes have a .96"" visual back and the T-adapter has a female ring which screws over the visual back.In either case you still need a T-Ring to connect to your camera, be careful there too as there are now ones for 58mm digital cameras that are larger than the older 35mm.Getting Amazon to change these descriptions is difficult so hopefully this review can correct it."
2,Too Short for larger Eyepieces,"I bought this adaptor along with the Celestron T-ring. The T-ring works great on my D5100. It is not too snug, and it clicks in place just like my lenses. I don't recommend the Celestron adaptor, though. Fortunately, my Meade adaptor has the same threads and it is much deeper. The Celetron adaptor doesn't accomodate large eypieces very well. The eyepiece protrudes too far into the camera body with my 5100."
3,Didn't fit well on microscope,I thought that this will work perfectly on Leica confocal microscope but diameter was a millimeter more than expected. Didn't return for the shipping cost and time I didn't have to spend for it.
3,Universal T-Adapter,"I bought this for use with my Celestron 130 SLT telescope, but did not consider that my camara is a Kodak P-850 Digital SLR, which requires a 52mm barrel adapter, as well as a 52mm T-adapter!My own fault, due to my ignorance.But, I have ordered the required adapters and will post back later, after I get a chance to try everything out. Product is solid, and as described."
1,No difference,"Did not notice any change with this product. Used it approximately 3 weeks, very expensive for this small container. No visible difference."
5,Love this serum!,Used a sample for just one week and loved the results! Noticed smoother and firmer eye area. Just put in an order for more.
3,Old school pre CITES Treaty,"This slim volume, was written and copyrighted 11 years before the CITES trade agreement treaty of June 9, 1989. So the info on purchasing ivory and or owning it are outdated. The other info on preparing the ivory and the tools used are good for comparison. Of the way things are done today and the tools used. I would say this book would be good for the reference shelf, or some one with only a passing interest in ivory work. Check out your favorite search engine for the complete CITES treaty. Watch out as this booklet is sold on some ivory web sites for big bucks. I do own it."
2,not a lot of info,this book was NOT what i was looking for. The descriptions were brief and the photos not clear. (mainly because it's an old book- and the photo technology was lousy then)...BUT - for 98 cents plus shipping - what did i expect? You will not learn to do scrimshaw from this book....and really nothing on carving ivory.
4,"Mischief makers ""ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING GAMES EVER!""",Mischief Makers has to be one of the greatest 2-D sidescroller games made on a 3-D system. Its just so good how can u not like it!!!
5,A Hidden Classic,"At first when I bought this I though ""Why the heck did I just do that? It looks so stupid."" When I got it home I doubtfully fired it up only to find it was actually a good game. It's almost a Mega Man Senario where the main robot heroine, Marina, must save her creator from some nasty goons who kidnapped him. She doesn't a blaster like megaman (at least not as far as I have gotten)but her grabs, throws and rolls more than compensate for it. If you like what I've described and don't mind that the hero is a girl, then this is the game for you."
5,One of the best missed hits for the N64,"Looking back, most people didn't expect much from this game, boy where they wrong as this game has a unqiue play style, story and enough action to keep one glued to the end."
4,Treasure's Lost Gems,"Being on the N64 was one thing, but having lackluster sales during the time of this game's release doesn't help get this game noticed enough. Not too rare, but definitely a gem to track down and purchase if you get the chance. Great graphical effects never seen on the N64. Feels a lot like a SEGA game (Klonoa) mixed in with Treasure's other gem, Gunstar Heroes."
2,this game sux,I dont see why everyone loves this game. it combines horrible graphics with boring gameplay and a pathetic ending. dont buy this game.please dont buy this nasty little excuse for a n64 game.
5,Best book I have ever read on the subject.,"This book is a sensitive look at mental illness in an area where such people are often ignored. As a sufferer myself, I could really identify with the author. The book was very helpful."
3,Mas O Menos,"Este cd no es nada comparado a lamento shows discos anteriores. Tienen una o dos buenas rollas pero es todo. Desde que los cantantes originales se salieron, la musica de lamento a bajado en calidad. Unas largas es una rolla echa indirectamente a montez pero porque? Si algien sabe ponganlo en el review. Bueno, es un cd mas O menos solo si eres HARD CORE FAN de lamento. Compra sus discos mas anteriores O la banda show revelacion para escuchar mejores rollas con los cantantes originales."
5,AWESOME!,"This game is the greatest game I've ever played on any platform. If you enjoy adventure and action, BUY IT it combines them both. Once you play this you'll never go back to regular gaming."
3,"good, but don't count on starting your collection w/ it.","A very decent cd, very nice. But don't buy it untill you've got some stuff from dick dale, the mermen (glorious lethal euphoria), man or astroman? anway, three stars, that about sums it up."
1,This is a bad book,"The author seems to only have researched information supporting his questionable theories, shoddily covering the basics. Numerous mistakes on the most basic of information soured me immediately. He confuses Sherman's mother with Sherman's sister in the first few pages. Taking a sampling of letters and writings, the author takes huge leaps to broad conclusions. This is hardly the level of research one would hope to find in the biography of any subject. Read any of the other Sherman biographys before you pick up this one, if you are to pick it up at all."
4,valentine to wyler,"A gushing but useful and heartfelt valentine to Wyler, produced by his daughter. There's room for a different film on this alternately overrated/underrated director but we should be grateful that we have this one. Interviews with Wyler, his wife, John Huston, Audrey Hepburn and many others are quite good."
5,GEM!!!!!,The Love Trap is just a beautiful gem of a part-talkie film. Kino's quality is excellent and just perfect. The documentary on William Wyler is also great. The gallery of trailers is also a treat.
4,Get to know a great director and see one of his earliest films,"Film buffs would do well to seek out this DVD double-feature gem: you get a 58-minute documentary- interesting and well produced- about the great director William Wyler and an early Wyler semi-silent film from 1929, ""The Love Trap"", which is funny and moving (and, according to the Wyler filmography included on the disc, one of about a dozen films he directed that year). You also get fifteen or so complete movie trailers of Wyler's films. Particularly impressive here, however, is the sharpness of the print of ""The Love Trap"". Aside from one or two moments of wear, it's a pristine look back at a movie-making era long gone. A nicely-done disc all around."
5,"I Agree - The Best, Indeed.","If you listen to this disk, and all other Ron Thal records, you will be treated with insanely creative compositions, brilliant lead guitar work, melodious vocals, cleverly rich arrangements and witty and thoughtful lyrics. This album is very sophisticated and there are many little musical treats that you will discover along the way if you listen to it over and over and over again. Like I have. In your musical journey riding the bumbelfoot beast you will encounter: really cool background vocal tracks.. one on top of the other sung by the Thalster himself... melodic and atypical musical lines with odd rythms and pitches.. which are truly unique.. and when listened to as a whole are quite beautiful. I could go on and on. In short, if you would like to listen to a genius at work - buy the frickin album."
4,geat variety pack,"this is great for the beginner espresso lover, great italian tradition in both unique and different flavors. for anyone who wants to become a espresso expert try this selection, i lived in italy and lavazza is the norm. distinctive aromas and will notice the difference and find what your tatse is. cheap but yet hard to find in the states. but thanks to amazon there is an opprotunity."
2,Hank wouldn't have understood...,"The Complete Lyrics ... it sounded too good to be true, and it was. I wanted to have the lyrics as Hank had sung them. Mr Cusic has ""amended"" them to be politically correct. Hank (or Luke the Drifter) wouldn't have recognised parts of 'The Funeral' ... ""curly hair, protruding lips"" clearly offends Mr Cusic's sensibilities so he's rewritten it. I won't bother quoting his PC version here. Having compiled the complete lyrics of Jimmie Rodgers (the Singing Brakeman, not Hank Snow's son) for my own reference they're all how Jimmie sang them. So sad that Mr Cusic thought his lyrics were better (or more socially acceptable) than Hank's originals."
5,"Mystic Life, A Fresh Look at Being Human","Dana Reeve was quoted as saying, ""Sometimes the only cure for grief is grieving."" Being human is feeling. The author shows us that we need to express rather than suppress, not only to heal, but to truly evolve as humans."
