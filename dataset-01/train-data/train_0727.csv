1,Left Connector Does Nothing,"I tried to connect it to my stereo, but the left connector does not work at all. The right connector works just fine. But there is no sound from the left. Don't waste your money on this cord, find a different one."
3,,"Took forever for the item to get here. About a week, after emailing the sender, product finally arrived."
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good, Sound quality is great and all that but I think the outer plastic wears off pretty easily, maybe its just me."
4,Review Title,So i bought this product thinking it would go from my tv to pc speakers but for some reason that didnt work out well. I think it would work if maybe i switched it to another tv as a standby sound comes on as if the outputs arent really working on my tv. I now do not need the wire and it is just something sitting on my shelf but i was very much happy with the speed of delivery and was satisfied with the purchase and the seller. If i test it on another tv set and it doesnt work ill just come back and say so.
1,Stay away,"When I plugged these into my Audioengine D1 external DAC, I noticed both the speakers are producing the same sound. No stereo.So I tried plugging in and out ONCE, and the pin was already broken and got stuck in the analog output port in my dac.Very very cheaply made.Now I have a useless cable and a DAC with a blocked port lying on my table.Great."
4,Just what I ordered,"this product is exactly what i needed. worked well and as expected. nothing glorious, but it is good when tech toys do what you want them to without complication."
5,Works very well,Been using it to watch movies without disturbing my wife and daughter in their activities. It converts perfectly to stereo sound.
1,Defective,"The female 3.5mm jack end was defective and would not take a male headphone jack. I gave it one star since I did actually receive a product, albeit a defective one. Not worth the cost and effort to mail back. Will buy locally at Radio Shack for more money and will likely have to buy two items to accomplish the same. Disappointing."
4,Splitter,This product did exactly what it said it would do at a great price. Works well for using computer speakers on your television.
5,Great buy,"Excellent, comparable to other cables of this type but very cheap. Used it to connect external computer speakers to my audio out on the TV. What else can you ask for?"
4,Good Product,"I bought this for my TV so I can plug my headphones in without having to bother my partner while she's sleeping. It works great, except that for certain headphones you cannot change the volume level. Luckily, I have headphones with a volume adjuster so it's not an issue, but I've tried it with regular headphones without volume and there was no way to turn up the volume."
1,does not work!,"i was happy with the decent delivery time, but once i got it and tried it out it did not work. seeing that it was only 80 cents it doesnt seem worth it returning it."
5,"Works as advertised, and cheap!","Works well, solved my problem, and only cost 88 cents with FREE SHIPPING. What a great deal - I'm happy with the purchase for sure."
3,"Great cable, stereo too!.. for a month and a half.","Great cable, stereo too. Only disadvantage is you have to provide a 3.5mm jack. Id also say it's well built!Edit;knocking this down to three stars. Connections going lose somewhere (only been a month and a half) which is cutting off one speaker so you have to ""jiggle it"" to get it to go stereo.Bought a riteav cable instead."
5,"works as expected, no problems","I bought this basic product in order to play my video games without bothering my roommates too much. Works well, I haven't had any problems in the 2 months I've used it."
5,Does what it's supposed to,"This product does exactly what it says and is supposed to do. Works great and sounds great. Looks pretty good, too."
1,did not last long at all,cheap connectors; cheap wire; don't expect it too last long; mine lasted a few months before it started to deteriorate (crack/separate) in a couple places due to flexing... I ended up buying the best... an equivelent version from Monster Cable here on Amazon
1,What cable?,"When I received this cable, I had some high expectations. All of which, were not met. If you think this cable to going to let you plug headphones into it so you could listen to the TV without hearing the TV through it's speakers, you're wrong, and so was I. After plugging it into the TV, all I head in my headphones was static. No my headphones are not broken, as I checked it with two pairs. My only assumption being that this cable does not work!If you think that 2x well means that you are receiving two of these cables, you're wrong again, as I only received one."
5,mrlee,can't beat the PRICE and quality. Paid more in the store. Used to connect computer speakers to LED TV. You can't go wrong.
4,cool item.,Works great and is a good way to hook up an ipod to a stereo. Get one and you are saved so much hassles with other docks that don't work.
1,CHEAP!!!,"Within a few weeks of having this connector and only using it one time or so, one of the rca pins just snapped off. Seemed very cheaply made."
1,"EDIT: Worked Fine for a bit, then one channel gave out on both cables.",Did everything I expect it to do for a few days until the audio kept going out in one of my speakers. It worked for a bit. Currently scheduling a replacement.
2,Low quality,"Cheap construction and performance, does not connect correctly to my devices.The connection terminals are fragile and do not connect as they should.Spend a little more and get something better..."
2,Didn't work out for me,I bought two of these cables but weren't able to use as connection is loose when I'm connecting them with Monster cable (male end) to split subwoofer signal.
1,i dont received the product,"buy the product and cancel it and still not recieved, please i need response that I sent them. thanks. if you send me a copy of the invoiced please send me because i don't have the product and i don't received any of this"
1,Recieved wrong cable,"I have been trying to resolve receiving the wrong cable from this company for some time. They finally sent one of the correct cables but not the second I ordered. They finally sent a second cable but was also the wrong one. They sent various emails stating the problem would be resolved but so far I have not received the correct cable. They did refund my money, not what I requested just want the correct cable."
2,cable adapter,"dixin't need this for the way our system is configure.. system came ready to plug and go, with necessary cables"
5,Works like a charm,This is just what I needed for listening to the TV with headphones. The product is quality for the price and I couldn't be happier with this product.
5,Does its Job. What more could you ask?,"Cords like these have many uses.I use it to hook up my iPod to an old 90's BOSE system.These cords are everywhere, so no real distinctions can be made. Build Quality is what you would expect from the price, nothing wrong though.I've used it for a few weeks now, no problems!"
3,"2 x RCA Male to 1 x 3.5"" Stereo Female Y-Cable 6 inch","For the price, an excellent bridge between a radio with RCA plug-ins and a headphone with a 3.5"" plug. It does the job of a bigger and more expensive cable I purchased at Radio Shack which I found too bulky for my needs.Update: It's a good product as long as you don't remove it from the jack that it's plugged into. When I did, the metal sheath came off and remained in the plug. The sound was great, but for under a buck, you get what you paid for."
5,It works...,"Not sure what else needs to be said about this product. Was used to send music from my computer to a surround sound system (old laptop, no optical output). No delay or crackling due to the extra cable that I could hear."
4,wrong one,it was cheao it was late and i got the wrong product . it is made well and I am sure we will find a use for it sooner or later..
5,Great,"Works just like its supposed to. Connected my tv to a spare computer speaker with only a AUX jack. Sounds great, no static. Saved me a few bucks too. Would buy again."
3,Nice,Did what its suppose to do the only problem is that I cant turn up the volume. I put up the volume on my tv but it stays the same. The actual tv gets louder not the head phones. Works great on xbox though.
1,Not worth buying,"Doesn't work at all. As soon as I got it, I plugged it in and nothing... Not a good idea to buy this product."
4,Does the job for little pay...,"I've found this product to perform perfectly for my purpose: connecting a good pair of headphones to my HDTV and the Xbox 360 so that I can listen through them instead of the built-in speakers. I gave this product a four star rating overall because the jack seems pretty tight and may possibly cause stripping of the cable over time, and the jack may fall out over time from the pulling force. If this happens, it will probably be over a long period of time and use, and I don't know for certain that it will become a problem at all. As far as the sound quality, I don't have any real reason to complain, but my experience with the sound thus far has not been thorough enough to give it a five star rating, though it may actually be worthy of it. If I had a choice, I would probably rate this product at 4.5 star rating. Definitely a lot of bang for the buck."
5,Works great,I wanted to use headphones for an old TV from the 90's so I ordered this. I used this cord to hook up an extra pair of computer speakers with a headphone plugin to the TV. It works just like I wanted it to!
5,"Good product, good price","I bought this to connect my TV out to headphones so I can watch TV without disturbing anyone late at night. For the price, I would have rather it been gold plated but I could not find any gold plated ones and for the price, I can afford to buy a new one as needed."
5,Very Happy Customer,Exactly what I needed at a very good price and received it earlier than was indicated. Not a single problem.
1,DON'T BUY!!!! Only gets 1 star bc you have to rate it to post review,"The price went down .25 since I bought it 14 days ago bc they are cheaply made and DON'T work! Even though I will be losing almost half of what I paid, I'm returning it."
1,Defective,I use the cable for my wireless headphones. I had to position the cable carefully to get stereo sound. Terrible quality.
5,excellent deal...works great thus far,Not too much I can say except it's still working after several weeks and it was really cheap. I used it to hook up some cpu speakers and subwoofer to the TV in my bedroom...Boom Boom Boom...;-)
5,Y Cable,It is what it is and does what it's supposed to. No problems with it at all. The price was great!
4,female 3.5mm to RGA adapter,"A great product for its price. This adapter has no bells or whistles to go with it, it simply does the job. Very happy with it, so far"
4,good buy for like 2,"worked fine, good buy wasn't sure it would work at first but am glad it did, would recommend if you have a turtle beach headset."
5,I like it!,I Like this product. It does it's work well. The sound is best. I suggest it to everybody. The customer service warks well. Many thanks!!
1,Left / Right signal reversal,The preservation of the correct left / right accuracy is non existent. I bought two of these and even they were not the same. The left channel was incorrectly crossed over to the right channel.
1,Half satisfied,The large graphics on the t-shirt is on the back. I thought it was on the front. My delivery was lost by my post man but when I contacted the seller he apologized and sent a replacement immediately. Overall very good customer service but the t-shirt was not what I had expected.
2,A collection of previously published rather predictable,This thin volume has nothing new from Locklin. He treats Bukowski so gently you might think Buk a fragile fairy godmother type if you didn't know of him previously. This book is obviously printed to make a buck and toadies to Sir Mammon.
3,Not exactly what I thought,"This cd has a few really great song, including ""Viva"" and ""Disconnected Child"", but I still regret buying it"
4,AN ULTIMATE RIDE,"TINSTAR - an unbelievebly great album for the classic industrial music lover, such as myself."
4,"The best song they have is head, rest isn't bad though","I never would have paid for this CD and heard all their songs, but after seeing them in concert I really like them. Head's the best song they have, and honestly the rest of the CD is just sorta wierd. I'm not sure exactly what they are I'd almost a techno group - all of their songs have excellent beats. If you ever have a chance to see them in concert, go for it!"
4,Silly old fool nods head,"There I was, pottering through the record store dredging the Blues shelf for something for a lazy weekend when I realised I was tapping my pocket-change, nodding my silly old head & feeling a Saturday night tingle on a tedious Friday lunchtime. The rhythyms on the moving-about-quickly tracks are infectious; David Tomlinson's thin, melancholy vocals sound more earnest than the lyrics really deserve but they nevertheless lounge beautifully over the slow buzzing of the bass and are guaranteed to encourage an indulgent, louche weekend."
5,It's High Noon for Tin Star.,"Tin Star's cd ""The Thrill Kisser"" is simply that - a wonderful collection of mature, well-arranged pop. Though ""Head"" would seem to be the standout track, I found myself drawn to the ruminating sadnes of ""Raincheck;"" the barbed delivery of ""Going Slow;"" and the jaded romanticism of ""Wonderful World."" This is a smart release for smart listeners looking for more than standard hooks and a catchy chorus."
3,"Some good songs, Some okay, Some just boring","I don't know... ""Head"",""Disconnected Child"", and ""Viva"" are great, even excellent songs. There are a couple other good tracks too. But about half the songs are way too slow for my tastes. If you like techno, this is a great CD, but if you are looking for more rockin' stuff like ""Head"", i'm sorry, but this is not for you."
5,A Must for any Lucy fan!,"Great book - a must for any Lucille Ball fan, and especially the collector. Beautiful photos that will bring back countless memories. Very well done!"
3,Outdated but good to look at,"This is persented as a collector's price guide, so he can know the value of his Lucille Ball collection. It has rare pictures of her and is a must for any Lucy fan. The prices are outdated however and there are too few stories throughout the book. The book might feel to some as too much Lucy and not enough pictures of others who worked with her."
5,THIS ALBUM IS A PANACEA FOR HYPERSTRESS.,"The Philips are rare talents who could sing a song like it was a special delivery from heaven. They make their songs come alive in the real sense of it. Their lyrics are very original and just sounds like it was specially made for you. I love them, I miss them."
3,It's A Good CD.!,"This Wilson Phillips CD is pretty good, I like several songs on it but especially Hold on and I recommend this CD!"
4,Good,"This is a good album by Wilson Phillips, It features three number one singles ""Hold On"", ""Release Me"" and ""Impulsive"". This is a very good album but some of it is just filler, unfortunatly there second album didnt sell as well and soon were out of the spotlight. This is a good album."
1,Just do not like it,"A few good songs, but you have to listen to the horrible ones first in order to get to the good one or two. I was very disappointed in this cd, i think it is horrible."
2,Not That Great!,"I bought this CD because I liked the song Hold Me and that is about the only song I liked, the rest of the songs are too mellow and I'm not a great fan of the harmonizing type of music so the CD just didn't do anything for me so I think I will bring this to a store near me that buys, sells and trades used CDs."
2,Vapid In A Nepotisic Way,This gooey little pop pustule is forgotten though not quite gone. It's amazing what you can do if your daddy was famous.
4,A second generation trio,"Wilson Phillips are respectively,the daughters of Beach Boy Brian Wilson(Carnie and Wendy) and John and Michelle Phillips(Chynna,pronounced ""chi-nuh"") of The Mamas and Papas. This threesome experienced abundant success as did their parents' respective groups. This 1990 debut smash spawned four Top 20 hits,HOLD ON,RELEASE ME(not to be confused with a different composition recorded by Engelbert Humperdinck),IMPULSIVE and YOU'RE IN LOVE. The other songs are good."
3,"It's cool, but looks kind of fragile","The action figure is cool, very posable and with good stuff, but looks fragile in my opinion, i think a larger version with different material should be better."
3,two tracks have wrong listing,The tracks Cold Turkey and Don't Worry Kyoko were recorded 1969 by Plastic Ono Band and not The Mothers of Invention.The album is good lennon. And if you give Yoko a chance her tracks aren't that bad.
1,"Say it ain't so, John!","I bought this CD, God curse me. Listening to it was like listening to a bobcat screeching as its claws are painfully pulled with a pair of pliers. No wonder the Beatles broke up. The other three must have been furious that shameful no-talent Yoko Ono was allowed to participate in their music. They probably play this CD for background music in one of the Seven Circles of Hell. Steer clear, for God's sake!"
1,It hurts!,"There's not much to say about this ""thing"". It just hurts what became of Zappa's King Kong (=> jamrag).Let me close with a zappa quote:""Don't fool yourself girl, it's going right up your poop chute"""
3,Play Loud!,"John and Yoko's tour de force of Political and social commentary. If you weren't born yet, you might not get some of this album. If you don't listen to lyrics you might not understand this album and if your looking for The Beatles you probably won't like this album either. This ain't ""Let it be"" or ""She loves you"" or ""Imagine"" If you want good rock and roll with some great vocals and socially conscious lyrics pick this one up. I recently played this CD very very loud and I must say it rocks! The second disc was included free when the album came out. It must be viewed as a free CD. A jam. Frank Zappa is great on here too. The live version of ""Cold Turkey"" (of which I believe George harrison helped out on guitar) is a blistering no holes barred version. Again, this must be played loud."
3,Almost Destroyed His Career,"It took John years to recover from this debacle. In the years after this came out, he was regarded as a joke and no one took him seriously. It was one thing to make a political statement and it was altogether another thing to make them into good songs. As a result, much of this sounded dated even in the 70's. Listening to it now puts things in a different perspective and time has treated this kindly. Disc 2 is great!"
2,"The worst he made. Not horrible, but...","Surely the worst Lennon album ever. It's all made up of slogans, and there are more Yoko's songs than Lennon's! Not really really really bad... but almost."
2,The ONLY poor Lennon album,"Why was this album even recorded? I would never have thought John Lennon could record something as terrible as Sometime In New York City, especially after the truly magnificent Plastic Ono Band and Imagine albums. Each song is written around a person or event of the time, meaning that listening to it today is a baffling experience. Nobody knows who Angela is, or what happened in Attica State. One of Lennon's greatest songs, 'Women Is The Nigger Of The World', appears in a weak form on this album. Although I like the song, this version doesn't save the album. I prefer the live take that appeared on the Lennon Anthology. The only redeeming feature of this album is it's second disc, a live album that includes a brilliant performance by Frank Zappa. Still, the only song on that which has merit is the stomping 'Scumbag'. A poor attempt by Lennon's to record a political album. I would only buy it to finish my collection."
1,Hold your nose.,"Whereas as the John Lennon songs on disc one are obvious knock-offs (he fits newspaper headlines to hoary old musical cliches; I can't imagine he spent more than a minute on any of them), Yoko Ono appears to be really trying--and that's the sad thing. Well, I might pity her cluelessness if I hadn't heard ""Sisters, O Sisters""--I'd rather shoot myself than hear it again.Avoid this record like the plague; that's my advice--and I'm not just saying, ""don't buy it""; I'm saying, ""don't even listen to it"". If you have any taste at all, you'll be very sorry. I certainly am."
4,great music,"I haven`t heard this since around 1983 or so .I loved this record as a teenager in the 70`s ,I wasn`t into all the jam stuff back then,maybe now I would like it.Angela is a great track as well as John Sinclair,Born In A Prison is a great track too.I just bought this cd and can`t wait til it gets here so I can hear it again."
2,Lennon's dismal detour,"I'm a ""compleat"" Beatlemaniac, and I don't mind the political statements at all, but this is a nearly unlistenable record that I have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album. I would have loved it if it had been a 7"" single, ""Woman is the Nigger of the World,"" with the rest of it just words written in liner notes. After that opening track, the remainder is a serious chore to get through. It's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent ""Imagine"" (1971) and the solid ""Mind Games"" (1973), but then again, John was not consistent, in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star. Love John for the genius he was, his commitment to peace, and the great music he made -- it's just that there's barely any of it on this particular record."
1,disappointment personified,"I purchased this cd for one particular track ""MAME"" having played it many times off a 45 when I was a jock on commercial radio. The cd contains some great tracks but not by the Frankie Vaughan I knew and loved. Don't be misled by the cover work, this is not the Frankie of old. DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Some nice rock reggae songs,"I was after this record for many years. I had to pay too much money for this out of print record but I could get these songs I was dying for:Til I can't take no more, Boys in the street, Romancing the stone, Rock you good.If you followed Grant and you avoid compilations, well, here it is!"
2,this IS WAY BELOW KILLER ON THE RAMPAGE :(,"THIS IS EDDIE GRANT ON WELFARE HERE W/ HIS MUSIC PRODUCERS SLEEPWALKING THRU OUT THE RECORDING PROCESS,THIS ALBUM JUST SOUNDS PLAIN CHEAP W/ THE EXCEPTION OF ROMANCING THE STONE...IF YOU REALLY WANT THAT SONG JUST BUY EDDIE GRANTS HIT COLLECTION AND DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH ON THIS MESS OF A POOR ALBUM....THIS ALBUM JUST PLAIN BLOWS...SUB PAR REGGAE HERE FOLKS."
5,Great product! Will order again!,"This is the second time I have ordered Jessica McClintock perfume from Amazon. I have been very pleased with the price, quality, and speed of service in which I received the perfume. I will order this product again."
5,Very nice summer scent.,"This is very stong with Lilly of the Valley scent indeed! Its beautiful! May I suggest the new scent called Satin Ribbons, its a heady scent for the fall and winter, it almost smells of chocolate but not quite but it is a nice fall scent to ware and holds nicely."
3,Quick delivery,The seller represented this product with the wrong item pictured.I thought I was buy Jessica McClintocks Always and Forever.The description was Jessica McClintocks. The picture threw me!
5,Hmmmm Jessica,I received my wonderful perfume within 2 days. I love how this perfume smells on me. I receive more compliments and its hard to find at the stores. Macy's and Kohl's sells its for $65.00 and $55.00. Walmart used to sell it for $25.00. So glad I purchased here.
5,Very nice and stays on all day,"I have worn this perfume for several years now and I love the way it lingers with out being too strong. I get so many compliments. I don't understand the comments about buying here at Amazon versus the department stores. It is the exact same thing. I don't believe that it is ""watered down"" Same exact bottle. hmm? Either way, it would proably cost more at the department stores because of the mark ups. For the price and the fact I can put it on early morning and it stays on all day."
2,wrong product,"I received the wrong item. I wanted the fragrance, ""jess"" by jessica mcclintock which is what is pictured in the advertisement, however I was sent adifferent fragrance. The pictured item does not match with the description given and is very misleading. I consequently am very dissatisfied with this shopping experience and am seeking a refund or a replacement with the item I wanted."
2,Counterfeit?,"This item arrived with no celephane wrapping as is customary for all high-end parfum. I will be returning it for that reason. Also, at first, the aroma is very strong, but in no time it dwindles. It seems to stay on clothing longer than on the body. 'Unsure of authenticity."
1,Not the real deal !,"If I could put a 0 star, I would! The fragrance is not the original one that i fell in love with . And now that I am out of the country, I can't even return it anymore without me spending shipping cost ."
5,Stopped and Asked about this all the time!,This is truly my one and only fragrance. Men and women both stop me when I am out and ask me about my perfume. Is the only perfume my husband can stand to have me wear. I have bought nothing else for the past 10 years. Is a light flowery scent that fills the senses.
1,It's not the same!!,I have purchased this same fragrance for about 5 years. I've bought is at a leading department store as well as from a perfume store at the outlet mall. I am very disappointed in this purchase as it seems to me that the fragrance is rather weak - almost as if it is watered down. Maybe that is why the price was so unbelievable.
5,Unexpected compliments....,"True story: I was at the checkout at an autoparts store. I was late 40's; the salesperson...maybe 20. As he was ringing up my purchases he looked kind of embarrassed and says ""I am not hitting on you or anything, but you sure do smell good!"" I just had to laugh; he was so polite and sincere. Of course, I said thank you and told him I was wearing ""Jessica Mcclintock"" by Jessica Mcclintock. Random, unexpected compliments are always the best, and most sincere. That young man made my day!"
3,purchase,"thanks...but it is a stronger smell than I recall sampling at Belk's recently, but, I use just one slight spritzer of it when using it; it will last me years.Barb"
5,Jessica McClintock,I bought this fragrance for my wife as it is one of her favorites and one of mine. It is a great fragrance and buying it on Amazon is a great deal.
2,Test it first,"I bought this perfume because I liked how it smelled on someone else. However, I have to say that I was really dissappointed when I used it.Firstly, I found that I had to spray a lot of it to really be able to smell the frangrance. Then, I realized that I did not like how it smelled on me. It seemed to have a chemical scent on my own skin. I wish I would have gotten a tester of it before deciding to buy 3.4 oz worth.I do have to have to say that I gave it to 2 stars only because I happened to like how it smelled on someone else. So, I would not discount it completely. I would encourage you to make sure it smells good on you personally before choosing to purchase this perfume."
4,Jessica Mcclintock By Jessica Mcclintock For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Oz.,"It's the first time a bought this for my wife, she likes it. I like to smell it on her. You should try it for the lady in your life."
2,A little off,It's not quite the same. I'll probably end up buying another bottle at a department store and won't try this again.
1,dont buy!,"my friend bought this perfume not too long ago from amazon (probably from another seller) and the scent spot on, close to what would be bought at the store. i was running out of the perfume so i thought that maybe i'd get the same thing but i was wrong. the item that i purchased had an awful alcohol scent and WAS NOT ANYTHING REMOTELY CLOSE to the perfume that my friend bought. i am very familiar with its distinct scent as i have been wearing it all through my adulthood so i was very disappointed when the product came in. teaches me a lesson for buying it online rather than from the store."
5,Beautiful Scent!,"I buy a bottle of this a year, I have been wearing this scent since I was 17, my best friend Kara Jaques bought me my very first bottle. It was her favorite perfume, now in memory of her, I buy a bottle every year. A truly beautful scent and has wonderful memories attached to it!"
4,"My wife likes it, therefore I like it...",My wife used to have this perfume and loved it. I got it for her for Christmas and Amazon had the best price by far. I'm happy she is happy.
3,I love Jessica McClintock Eau De Parfum!,I have used this for years. It smells fresh and isn't heavy. I ordered two large bottles. One smells perfect. The other has more of a alcohol smell instead of perfume. Why is that?????
2,Watered down?,I have worn Jessica McClintock perfume for years. This last bottle I purchased seems watered down. The scent doesn't stay on me like before and even the color is closer to clear. I bought two bottles so I hope this bottle is just a fluke. I am disappointed. Not sure what happened to the product and why it is different. :-(
1,"STALE, FAINT AND OLD!","I bought this for my wife. She likes to wear this fragrance for work and everyday activities. I usually purchase this item at Macy's for $75. So I thought this was a bargain. That was a big mistake. My wife was not pleased with the aroma. She thought that this must be stock that was lost and recently found and that's why the price was so CHEAP! She described it as musty, tired, indefinite, indistinct, obscure, opaque, pale, shadowy, unclear, undefined, undetermined, vague, aged, and unyoung. DO NOT BUY unless you like your Eau De Parfume STALE, FAINT AND OLD!"
2,"Sorry, but NOT the real deal!","It smells really close to Jessica McClintock, but the real deal lasts FOREVER! This fades so quickly that I can many times I don't even make it into the office with perfume. I gave it two stars, because quite frankly.....I should have known that the price was too good to be true!"
2,record company censorship at its worst,"I've been a nut over Van ""the man"" Morrison since his THEM days. His lyrics have always zeroed in on what makes this man's heart beat. His battles with the Parrot record company are legendary. An Irish rebel. This CD has many of his great ones. It has a few of his sucky ones also. Greatest Hits? I think not. But what really burns me about this CD is the song Brown Eyed Girl. A true classic. A masterpiece. But on this CD, Mona Lisa's smile has been altered. No longer are we making love in the green grass behind the stadium but now we're running and laughing. The record company has decided that makin' love in the green grass is too paganistic for modern society. By modifying the lyrics the song has lost its heart. And in my opinion has tainted the entire CD. If they are allowed to change the lyrics maybe next time they can change the players or the singer. Hell, put Tony Burrows on vocals. That guy sang nearly every song in the late 60's anyways."
4,CD purchase,CD was in excellent shape but the case was cracked...disappointed in that alone...but definitely glad to find this CD...I have always liked it.
4,Good compilation,"My only criticism of this collection is the omission of ""Wavelength,"" one of my favorite Morrison songs. And, yes, I could have done without the Them songs but I do understand why they are included. Overall it's a good cd to pop in from time to time just to remind myself that there are artists still out there who never did it for the fame or notoriety. They just did it for the music."
3,"Not bad, but not great either...",Where is Tupelo Honey??? That song should have been included in this Best of CD.....
5,Incredible Compilation!,"The Best of Van Morrison is a great CD. It is one of the best greatest hits CDs that I have listened to. It is only missing a few songs. It is missing too many songs from Astral Weeks, but I would reccomend buying that album anyway. It is also mising Morrison's incredible song Tupelo Honey. Other than this, the CD is perfect. If you want one CD by morrison, this is the one."
5,very solid,"Van Morrison is a great songwriter.i really like Moondance,Gloria,Brown eyed girl,&Wild night.his songs have held up for a long long time.his voice is still solid after all of these years."
3,Be Forewarned,"People thinking of buying this CD, which is certainly a great compilation of some classic Van Morrison, should know that it was a victim of censorship butchering by the record company that produced it. In ""Brown-eyed girl"" the line ""making love in the green grass"" which is heard on the radio all the time, was replaced with ""laughing and jumping."" Not that this should discourage you from buying the CD, unless you're the type of person who gets all bent out of shape about those kind of things. Just so that you know..."
2,This is NOT the Way to Listen to Van Morrison,"No argument, this disc is full of superlative tunes from Van Morrison. But this is not Elton John, Van Halen, or any other hitmaker. Even a Beatles 'Best Of' makes more sense than this. Each album by Van Morrison is a statement by itself, and can only be appreciated in its entirety. This LP seems to attract new listeners, and earns its second star for that reason only. Besides, you have 'Moondance' as Van for beginners. For graduate work, his masterpiece is NOT 'Astral Weeks', but 'St Dominic's Preview'. 'Veedon Fleece' for your Doctorate. If you buy this collection, promise to pass it along after your acquire the original recordings."
5,A Fine Introduction to the Legendary Van Morrison!!!!!!,"I am a huge Van Morrison fan (I have 12 of his CD's), and when I first saw a 'best-of' compilation on a single disc, I burst out in laughter! I thought that would be impossile, with so many great songs and albums you could not possibly get all of them onto one disc. I was wrong. If you are new to Van the Man, this is a great place to start. Although some of the exclusions, in my opinion, are almost criminal (Madame George and The Way Young Lovers Do are no where to be found) it is still a stunning musical achievement. But, don't take my word for it, listen to it yourself!!If you like this one, buy 'Moondance' and 'Astral Weeks' (ignore all traffic signals and roadblocks if possible!)"
5,Almost perfect,I had this disc once before and it was stolen. Loved it so much I had to buy it again. I wish it cotained Tupelo Honey and Into the Mystic. Other than that I love this disc . I recommend this to anyone. Whether you are a big fan or just only know a couple of his songs. Lively and uplifting. Great for traffic jams.
4,Brown Eyed Girl??,This could have been a great compilation. Am I the only one who noticed they butchered Brown Eyed Girl?? The lyrics are changed in the version on this disc. Reason enough not to buy it.
3,Photography budget heeded,"THE BEST OF VAN MORRISON contains all the Van Morrison smashes. But it overlooks a couple of Morrison's minor hits, ""Tupelo Honey"" and ""Scandinavia,"" in favor of a few songs I, for one, never heard in public. The accompanying booklet seems slapped together, lacking notes, musician credits and pictures (except for the same microphone shot - the art director must have liked it). THE BEST OF VAN MORRISON meets the minimum requirements of a greatest-hits package."
4,Almost excellent!,"This was an excellent disc. The only complaint that i have is that some of Van Morrison's best music was not on the disc. I can truly say that a ""greatest hits"" album is not complete without ""Into the Mystic"". Although I was a little disappointed with the songs that were not included, this was a superb album!"
4,You call this a greatest hits??,"Okay, somebody tell me...how can an album call itself the ""Best of Van Morrison"" and omit ""Tupelo Honey""? Where is ""Into the Mystic""? Bah! Some great songs here, but come on. If you're going to remaster the original hits collection at least make it a truly comprehensive track lineup. Inexcusable."
4,Lots of good choices but woefully incomplete,"If you're a fan of Van Morrison you already know that you need to own ""Astral Weeks"", ""His Band And The Street Choir"", ""Moondance"", ""Tupelo Honey"" and ""St. Dominic's Preview"".If you're a casual fan or are just discovering Van Morrison and find yourself digging him you really do need the entire first 5 CDs because here's a small list of what's missing from this disc: ""Into The Mystic"", ""Starting A New Life"", Like A Cannonball"", ""Everyone"", ""Glad Tidings"", ""Call Me Up In Dreamland"", ""I Wanna Roo You"", ""Astral Weeks"", ""Slim Slow Slider"", Madame George"", ""St. Dominic's Preview"", ""Bulbs"" and about 15-20 other really great cuts.As a greatest hits this satisfies in the sense that there are no weak songs but Van Morrison takes you on a special ride on each of his first 5 CDs and a greatest hits package simply cannot do that. Context matters and trust me on this - if you like what you're hearing on this CD...there ain't nothing like the real thing."
2,Bad Compilation of Great Music,"Straight to the point, this is one of the worst compilations of hits I have ever heard. I LOVE Van Morrison, but i HATE this CD. It flows very badly from genre to genre, and on top of that, it isnt even that good a collection, A few of morrisons best songs are missing.This is a collection for people who know nothing of morrison and his genius, or want an aweful introduction to his music. Just buy Astral Weeks and Moondance (they are less expensive than this CD, and combined its only a couple bucks more.)"
4,Van's still the Man,"I've been a huge Van Morrison fan since I firts heard Moondance. I have also been listening to his cd's for the past 6 years, all of which have been relatively amazing. I'm not sure how much influence he has over his bands, but each group he performs with has made his music that much better. In this collection of songs, the listner will automatically enojy the first eight tracks, for the simple fact they are all familiar songs in classic movies. ""Browneyed"" girl had been featured on 9 soundtracks since it's first release, ""Gloria"" on 3, his rendention of ""Have I told you lately"" on 2, ""Moondance"" on 4, and the list continues. This is a great cd for those of you who don't already own Van Morrison but enjoy his music. Or just for the reuniting gatherings where each song can egnite a remenescent conversation."
2,Skip This One,"Van is great, but the edited version of his greatest song ""Brown Eyed Girl"" is on this CD. Otherwise has some good tracks."
3,Lack Of Material~,"I just bought this album at Fye Music and I really did not care for much of the latter material presented on here, but their are some key songs including And It Stoned Me, Brown Eyed Girl, Moondance, Gloria, and Domino. But Van Morrison did not throw together that great of a hits complination due to the fact he didnt care for these kind of albums....whatever. But its rather good album giving many different styles of morrisons music, I hope fans will like this album, but MOONDANCE is the best greatest hits complination. I was going to give this 4 stars but I thought it only deserved 3 due to the lack of material on here."
2,I should have bought it from Amazon.com,If I'd bought this CD from Amazon.com instead of the local CD store I would have wasted only fifteen or sixteen dollars instead of twenty. What a waste! What is the attraction? Van the man won't get me again.
1,I Hate This Dude,This horrible little idiot is SO annoying. His voice stinks and his lyrics are stupid. His music is only for idiots who are too brainwashed by outdated garbage music like this to realize that there is such a thing as a catchy beat.
5,Way Underated!,The only problem with this CD is it didn't get any airplay on our middle of the road FM stations with their top 400 play lists. This is just some of the coolest southern rock around with country influences. Pirates are on fire here!
5,Good to the last page!,"The artwork is so perfectly rendered, the three ladies so lyrically choreographed to their verse, no wonder this remains a favorite of mine over the years. So nice to have it back in print![...]"
3,Nice book but not sure about children's,"Great rhymes, I like it, but, ven when I'm a Gorey great fan, I'm not sure his drawings at least in this case are the most suitable for children, as they always have that grim or mysterious essence. It all depends on the age it is aimed for, also... (sorry if my English is not very good)"
3,Colin Farrell & Al Pacino: What's Not To Like?,"As an action/supspense/thriller, this film has it all. Star power, twists & turns, a love interest for Colin, and wonderful dialog delivered expertly by Al.Somehow, it just didn't quite intrigue me. I wasn't very invested in any character except for Colin's, and the story is nearly incomprehensible, as well as the ending.It's fun and entertaining, in an action movie way, but little else. Good for a watch, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it."
2,Wide Screen 1.77 not 2.35,The picture of this DVD is in 1.77:1 Aspect Ratio. Not in the 2.35:1 Aspact Ratio that was presented in the theaters.This is FULL SCREEN for 16:9 TV's..!!There no trailers on this DVD.
2,Better than prescription sleeping pills..,"I tried watching this film twice, but I fell asleep in the middle both times. Is Al Pacino's character good or bad? The plot twists and turns like the choreography of an epileptic break dancer, but I just did'nt care. In the end, I was snoozing.I'm glad I was'nt in a theatre watching this, those seats are so bad for napping."
4,Excellent...,"Great movie. Although its a type of movie that you really have to pay attention to or else you will be completely lost in the last scenes it is still a great one.So story is about this man James(Farrell) who has tried to find out the exact cause of his father's death. A CIA man Burke (Pacino) recruits him to join the training for the CIA. Jaymes overcomes all of the obstacles he faces, being the star of the training. The tables begin to turn as he is faced with dissmissal from training and assigned to a case dealing with a woman he is involved with. Towards the end, he finds that nothing is what it seems when he has an interesting encounter with Burke.Good acting. Pacino and Farrell do a great job. Good directing. However, like i said, the beginning is very self-explanatory but then towards the middle and especially the end you really have to be paying attention because you get lost very easily.Recommended, its a good movie but a little complicated at the end."
4,Tense thriller,"I'm not sure what prompted me to add this to my Netflix queue, but it finally found its way into my mailbox -- and I was very happy with the film. I'm not a big Farrell fan, but he did a fantastic job as the son of a deceased oil man who just might have been a special agent. Farrell is recruited by Pacino, and undergoes intense training...only to break under pressure. Or so it seems. Pacino is Pacino, so of course his performance is outstanding.Some aspects of the story are a bit predictable, but the twist at the end was nice. If you're a fan of films that have you grasping the arm of your chair, this movie is for you. Good pace, language not too bad, and high on suspense."
4,Nothing is as it seems,"When you watch this movie you will remember two things. ""Everything is a test"", and Nothing is as it seems."" You will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next. Is this a test, or is this the real thing you will ask yourself over and over again. James Clayton is still dealing with his Father's disappearance. James is recruited by Walter Burke to join the CIA, but James will find that nothing is at it seems, and he will realize he can't trust anyone but himself. The movie is intense, and a great thriller. I liked the peek into the CIA and the recruiting process. Al Pachino and Colin Farral were good together in this film."
4,Dark and sombre - feels like something's missing though,"Colin Farrell is perfectly cast in his role as the Recruit. Al Pacino plays a sinister mentor better than anyone (remember the Devil's Advocate?). But even though the casting is perfect and the plot has so much potential - I still felt as though something was missing from the movie. Don't get me wrong - this is one of my new favorite DVD's - but at the point where the training ends and the real-world action begins, I think there's a dropoff in plot & quality..."
2,"Interesting set-up, disappointing conclusion","I have to say I was disappointed with this movie. It started out with a relatively interesting premise and the training scenes were quite enjoyable. Unfortunately it then descended into farce, with contrived twist after contrived twist.The characters were underdeveloped, apart from Farrell and Pacino. Farrell is solid throughout and proves he can carry a film. Pacino, however, seems to be on autopilot and delivers the same shouty performance he seems to give in every film of late."
4,YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE.,"a good movie involving the c.i.a. and the recruitment process,training and assignments,but as with any movie or life theres always a fly in the ointment.just dig deep enough and you'll find it,and it's usually the big one."
2,Don't waste your money on this one,"I agree with the one star reviews, by and large. See it on TV if you must - it's a forgettable film. A silly thriller."
3,Confusing,"This movie is great but not for the right reasons. Usually I base the movie on it's plot and the understanding of it. This one has me still thinking though. It is good until the end comes around...when you start going WHAT??? If someone wants to explain what happened please do! This was however, my first Colin Farrell movie and I am in love! Al Pacino is great too. Buy this one for the hotties and not the plot...it has action though!"
5,ANOTHER AWESOME MOVIE TO ADD TO LIBRARY!,"ITEM WAS RECEIVED ON SCHEDULE, WELL PACKAGED AND IN GREAT CONDITION. ABSOLUTELY LOVE AL PACINO AND COLLIN FERRELL! GREAT ACTORS AND WONDERFUL MOVIE TO ADD TO OUR 100+ DVD LIBRARY! ALWAYS A PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH AMAZON AND THEIR TOP RATED SELLERS!"
4,A REAL SURPRISE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.,"CIA psychological THRILLER with many twists and turns. Who can you trust? What is real? I thought Colin Farrell was really great. AL Pacino was good, also. Really KEPT MY ATTENTION. Can't say I loved it, but I REALLY, REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE ALOT! I shared it, and it was really well received. Probably not for children (adult themes)."
3,"To fully understand, you have to watch it more than once","The one thing I can guarantee you in this movie is that there are enough twists and turns that even the most intense watcher will not figure out everything until the end.Who are the bad guys and who are the good guys? What is real and what is a test? Or is everything a test of some kind?This movie is rated PG 13 for violence, sexuality, and language. I enjoyed it because it challenged my perceptions of reality and of trust, since the key issue within the movie involves finding out who is trustworthy.Recommended for older audiences."
2,Uh -- why does this movie exist?,"I know why Colin Farrell did this, but how Al Pacino could read this script and think, ""Wow, I have to do this movie!"" baffles me. Not a terrible movie by any means, but not a necessary one, either."
4,A Compelling Story,"I was afraid that this was the type of movie punched out in a day based on a screenplay also punched out in a day.Well it's not Shakespeare but we do get well rounded characters and a real plot. I've never been a big fan of Roger Donaldson but the directing is good.As you can probably guess from the trailer, our hero Colin Farrel is recruited into the CIA by Al Pachino. After spy school, Farrel is given his first asignment, to spy on his fellow recruits. Who are they spying for? Who is he really spying for? Yes there really is a plot I won't give away.There was much fanfair over Farrel's preformance. I find him to be over rated.'The Recruit' is worth seeing but not on the level of the classics like 'Day of the Jackel'."
3,Good performances,"Sometimes actors are better than the movie that they're in. This is one of thsoe occasions. Farrell as the suposedly naive young recruit who turns into a double agent to capture Al Pacino the true criminal is a twist that is telegraphed from the beginning of the movie. The premise of having to go up against yuour mentor in a battle of wits isn't a new one. I'm still unclear as to how Pacino is taped giving an over the top confession. Sometimes smart people, aren't that smart. But he and Farrell do create a good measure of acting ability in a bad script."
1,A good beginning but then it goes south with a vengeance,"I had high hopes for this movie. I had heard it was loosely based on the Harold Nicholson case where a veteran CIA officer who worked on ""the Farm"" began spying for the Russians.The first twenty minutes or so don't disappoint. The scenes where Pacino recruits Ferrell and the training at the Farm seem to be pretty realistic and well done.But after that, the movie pretty much flies off into a never-never land that I'm sure would leave veteran CIA officers laughing with derision at what passes for a story. I don't want to spoil the plot for those who must see it, but suffice to say, CIA agents are not likely to ever, ever chase each other and engage in gunfights in Washington DC. In fact, they aren't very likely to do that in foreign countries either. I think as the Russians said, ""When the guns come out, intelligence ends."""
4,"CIA recruits learning all about lies, setups and deceptions","Starring Al Pacino as a hard-boiled instructor in the CIA, this action film moves fast. The best part is the training of these future CIA agents. Over and over again their instructor manipulates them until nothing is what it seems and the audience soon realizes that everything is a big setup and a lie. This is the lesson of the film, but the actors seem unaware of this.Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan are cast as two future CIA agents. Both are good to look and inevitably they couple up. Of course there are complications. And lots of lies. The plot skips along with accelerating speed, and it's all rather fun to watch. There's a love scene and a chase scene and attempts to confuse the audience as to just who the bad guy is.The actors all give good performances and the action never ceases. But the plot is so convoluted that I never made sense of it. Nor did I care."
4,A great movie with a few flaws.,"The Recruit is a great movie detailing the aspects of a CIA recruit, who is coached along by Al Pacino, who always says, ""Nothing is as it seems."" This turns out to be true on several occasions. The movie has so many twists that it almost makes your head spin. The only true downfall of this film is the abrubt end, which leaves you more questions than answers, which is the life of a CIA agent, I suppose. I'll give the director the benefit of the doubt and say its a message he is trying to convey ;). Overall, its a good movie that you should try to see sometime, and if your into the militaristic films, its a nice addition to your collection."
1,Worst Movie ever!!!!!!!,I saw this moive in the theater with a large group of people with varying taste every person thought that it was the worse movie they have ever seen. Guys if you like Al Pacino and thinl he can do no wrong you will still hate this movie trust me. It is terible and what makes it worse is that they try and make it complicted so as to pass as an inteligent movie and hide the lack of a plot and acting that destroys this movie. It also has that generic feel to it you can tell the writers did no research about the topic and instead just tried to count on two big names to carry this terrible move. Nobody with any taste can enjoy this movie.
3,"not great, not bad, but good","to make a long story short, this is a good movieit wasn't great, not as much action as you might think & the ending was kind of predictableit wasn't bad, but it was corny at timesit was just average..."
5,An adrenaline rush!,"RECRUIT is Hollywood at its frenetic best. If you're up for a well made, edge-of-the-seat thriler then this is defintiely a movie for you. The story is well written, tight, pungent, and with just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing (even though you may have an idea where the movie is going from the start). Part of the reason that the movie's premise that nothing is what it appears is that it plays well when it in the hands of Colin Farrell and Al Pacino. There is a roughness to the exterior of both Farrell the actor and Farrell the main character that belies the classic vulnerbility of the guys who make you want to believe in their character. Pacino delivers, as usual, as does the rest of this supporting cast. But it is Colin Farrell who is proving himself to be an actor on the rise...and that is enough reason to bolt to the theater to get your adrenaline going! A good show, this."
3,Don't Expect Much and it will Surpass Your Expectations,"This is a throw-away movie that you can leave behind but while you watch it, you'll enjoy it.If you like Colin and EVERYbody likes Pacino (don't they???), you'll enjoy the movie. You probably will realize who the good and bad guys really are fairly early, but even if you don't, it's fine when you find out. You won't be disappointed and you won't be totally shocked either.This is a good, action/military kind of movie but it won't stay with you. That's fine, we need lots of movies like this one to fill us up while we wait for the next Big Fish or something memorable like that."
5,SOOOOO GOOD!!,I LOVED this movie!! It had so many twists and turns I thought that Id go mad before it was through!! Definitely a movie worth watching...and of course theres the added incentive of Colin Farrell who is just too yummy for words. Buy It!!
2,Pacino's Out of Breath in CIA Yarn,"I love Al Pacino. But Al Pacino looks and seems so tired in this movie. I want to see the Classic Pacino of The Godfather, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon. I'd even settle for the Comeback Pacino of Scent of a Woman, Carlito's Way, Heat, The Devil's Adocate, Donnie Brasco, and The Insider. But in The Recruit, all we get is the Post-Insomnia Pacino who says his lines with such strained physical exertion that you can feel the weight of every word. Pacino's choices of late have been questionable (Anyone catch Simone or People I Know?) so The Recruit is a step in the right direction. The plot and its CIA techno-babble hold its own and Colin Farrell is charasmatic enough to keep things going but the whole time I was waiting for Pacino to make the The Recruit worth my while. That never happened. When the credits finally rolled I felt I had finished watching the film more out of courtesy than genuine interest."
4,YOU JUST PASSED THE ENDURANCE TEST,"Al pacino!a lot is expected out of this old-timer....well,""nothing is what it seems to be"".The man is desperate for a screen presence.Accepting a role just because he is portrayed to be the king-pin of the movie.Of course his experience shows in the dialogue delivery.Colin does a neat job as the recruit.The first few frames of the movie seems like a documentry on the ""Central Intelligence Agency"".Hats-off to the screenplay-the movie does not stall.The part which really brings some satisfaction to the viewing audience is the part where pacino says,""you passed the final test"".This is where clayton and the audience is really surprised.Altogether the movie is a launching pad for Colin and one black dot for Al."
2,Disappointment,"I felt the whole movie was very predictable - I pretty much figured out everything that was going to happen in the scene before it happened. Colin Farrel is a great actor and he does a really good job in his role, I just don't think he had much to work with. Al Pacino has done a lot better with both chosing roles and acting. This isn't a movie I would watch again."
4,ESPIONAGE CAPERS TWIST YOUR NECK & NERVES,"WHO'S WHO?? AND WHO'S THE TRAITOR??GET THIS FROM THE BARGAIN BIN, USED, OR RENT, BUT IT WAS SUPRISINGLY BETTER THAN I ANTICIPATED.MADE THE HAIR STAND UP ON THE BACK OF MY NECK!COLIN FARREL IS GETTING BETTER WITH EACH FILM AND I HOPE HE DOESNT BURN OUT WITH B-GRADE MOVIES!!!"
3,"I liked but, it is predictable","Well acted, well filmed, full of twists and turns. ""Nothing is as it seems"" as Walter Burke (Pacino) says. If, at least once, they would have made something exactly as it seemed ... the moviegoer may have been surprised. What made it predictable was you always knew to expect the unexpected."
3,Recruiting is a dangerous proposition.,"Good to rent. Not good to own. Eventually, like all thrillers that have many twists and turns, this one seems very grounded in tests. Everything, explains Al Pacino, is a test. But what happens when things aren't always as they seem? What if there's an underlining conspiracy taking over? It did well in holding my attention but could easily be forgotten as just another thriller."
4,Everything is a test,"Nothing is as it seems in this movie as Al Pacino plays a recruiter for the CIA who brings in Colin Farrell, playing a young computer programmer, to start a career as a new operative. The movie takes us through the training as well as other action as we see that recruits are tested as much mentally and emotionally, as they are tested physically.As par for course, Pacino does a great job and has the audience believing his portrayal of the character. Just as the plot is multi-layered, Pacino's character, Burke, is just as multi-layered.I would recommend seeing this movie. Although the gadgetry is not as you would see in a James Bond movie, it is fascinating seeing the training."
4,I Really Liked It! :),"This movie stars Al Pacino & Colin Farrell and it has a surprise ending. I don't see what is SO terrible about it! As I've seen is these reviews. The plot is not exactly ""The Godfather"" but is still a good movie! Farrell is a riveting, sexy bartender, and Pacino is a sexy old dude CIA recruiting agent. Farrell is recruited into the CIA, and has a love scene with some chick, and woooooh HE is hott! ;) There is alot of drama, and emotional scenes in this movie. Very good stuff. Seriously, it is a good movie overall. :) Buy it! save it... get horny over it... etc...LOL!!!"
2,Nice try,"This movie took a while to pick up; only after he's kicked out of the CIA club does it pick up. But Colin Farrell's character is amazingly naive and gullible. If it was real life you'd wonder how he survived as far as he did. Some people like this movie for its ""suspense"" but I disliked it because the protagonist was such an imbecile."
2,Nothing special,"The Recruit was one of those movies where you can't say it's great, but you can't say it's bad either. It was about a guy who get's recruited by the CIA. He goes through training with a group of people, and graduates (or so he thinks) and get's an assignment. But then he realizes that everything is a test...That's it. Not much more to say about it."
3,SO-SO,"THE RECRUIT takes the viewer into a world most are unaware: the recruitment process for the CIA. Walter Burke (Al Pacino) actively recruits James Clayton (Colin Farrell) to enter ""The Farm"", the basic training facility for new recruits. What follows is a sequence of events leading through to their assignment as CIA Operatives.This movie is based on the premise that ""nothing is as it seems"", which equates to many plot twists and turns along the way. It is unfortunate that these same twists and turns are most often predictable and sad. Not only did I guess what was going to happen but so did many people sitting nearby (i.e., I often heard 'I knew it' from others).More predicable than the twists and turns is that this movie contains car chases... Believe me, I did not expect THE RECRUIT to be a 'deep movie', but I somehow expected more than what was delivered. If you must see this movie, at least wait until it's released on video."
1,Yawn,"Another predictable, boring, and totally unbelievable, overblown, pointless Hollywood production. Do we really need to see Al Pacino in another meaningless ""mentor"" film? I don't think so. One week his recruit is a bartender and voila, the next he's in the CIA...WOW! Can you believe that one? Avoid unless you like bad spy films."
2,"Not great, Pacino deserves more, Farrell less","Pacino took a step down in acting in this film. It really is not that realistic and I found several of the scenes to be bogged down in dramatic blah that in real life would not have happened. Sure, I realize it is just a movie but I have to challenge the director in asking what exactly he was trying to accomplish here. It has some fun action scenes but I suppose the plot is what suffers the most here, and when the plot falls, it all falls down.Al Pacino is a star, but why they had a bozo of an actor like Farrell in there alongside him is beyond me. Farrell can never add any emotion to anything he is in and I felt actually hurt this films chances of being better. Bridget Moynahan is also in it and I like her and wish she was in more films like this. If you want drama films that center on good storytelling, skip this movie."
2,American hubris and hypocracy,"The Trainer reveals something about America's world of thinkin: There is Good and Bad. And we choose Good. There is Right and Wrong- and we choose Right. Come on! Story is about CIA who has used most ruthless methods to destroy enenemy. Remember Chile 1970 when CIA and his allies toppless democratically elected president and choose instead murderous right wing dictatorship under control of Mr. Pinochet. And this is just one example how CIA ""choose right"".The film is quite a disapointment. Yes there is action, betrayal, etc. but something is missing. Boring movie. Ideologically typical American hypocracy. Bull."
2,"Hello! This is a ""Recruiting"" movie","1. You don't get the CIA to actively help you, and ""divulge"" secrets especially for your flick unless there is something in it for them.2. The whole premise of the first 1/3rd of the movie is to make the CIA look like a big Gen Y sleepover/campout.3. Pacino's George Bush inspired rant about ""Our cause is just"" and how in a world of right and wrong ""we choose right"" is obviously an appeal to the post 9-11 mentality. The CIA probabally fed the dialouge to the producer/director because it had worked so well in thier focus group studies.This is a CIA advertisment with some plot development thrown in.The last half of the movie could be considered a stand alone story, but first you have to sit through a CIA ""infomercial"".Not that it's a bad infomercial, but still underhanded and obnoxious if you see it for what it is. ""nothing is what it seems"" HA HA."
2,Fell asleep most of the movie,It was actually kinda boring. Farrell can suprisingly act. I fell asleep most of the movie but the ending still made sense!
1,Horrible movie,The recruit is a pure ego play for Pacino and Farrell. The movie itself makes no sense and isn't even interesting. Avoid this DVD at all costs!
3,A decent if unexceptional start for his solo career.,"Eddy Grant's 1977-issued ""Message Man"" was his solo debut album. It was an uneven set but includes two near-masterpieces in ""Hello Africa"" and ""Jamaican Child""--the other six tracks are of average quality at best. Despite its flaws and shortcomings, ""Message Man"" set the stage for his accomplishments on such albums as ""Walking On Sunshine"", ""Killer On The Rampage"" and ""Going For Broke""."

5,Excellent for studying Biblical Ancients!,This book is so fun.....an excellent picture book to read when studying Moses and Pharoah. This book in particular is about the plague of frogs.
4,Nice storage unit - BUT way bigger than you think!,"The knives are average, not top notch, but it's a great buy."
3,Cuisinart 15 piece cutlery set,"I was somewhat disappointed with the overall quality of the set. The knifes themselves are very light-weight and water-spot very easily, and the ""block"" they sit in is not very user friendly."
2,I did not like these knives,"When I first got them, I was amazed. They looked beautiful. they were good in design, and they are light. However, after one week passed, I saw rust on them. One month later, they looked ugly anymore because of rust. Disappointing for me."
3,Sharp but a little light,"I was really excited about ordering these knives. I ordered them and they even arrived a couple days early. Thanks Amazon. However, I tore into the box and I have to say I am a little disappointed. The knives are sharp and the ""vault"" is pretty cool. My biggest complaint is that the knives feel very light. They do not have the heavy feel that other high end knives have. The handles on this set are hollow and ""ping"" if you accidently hit them on something. I have given three stars because they are sharp and I still think they are decent knives for the money. I just want to set the expectation of a light feel. If the weight of the knives is not an issue for you then I recommend you buy these knives. If you are like me and want to know you are holding something then I would keep looking for another set."
5,Best knives I have ever had,I love to cook and find that I never have the right knife for the job. This complete set has it all. It is beautiful as well as functional. It even came with six steak knives that cut like butter. It has a nice black and chrome case to match and looks nice on my counter.The only down side is that it barely fits underneath my countertop. The case is quite tall.
2,inferior product,"When I received my set, I discovered, much to my dismay, that the knives are very light weight. Two of the knives were pitted on the handles, and the knife edges were pitted as well. The Chef knife is extremely dull. Overall quality is very poor, especially for Cuisinart."
4,semi happy :),i love the cutlery set no questions about it.... i just don't like the holder... it's way to big for a kitchen... now i don't know if i'll actually end up putting it on the counter top but i will be using them for sure.... thanks again
2,RUST PROBLEMS,"I ordered two of these sets last year as Christmas gifts for my children. While both of them said that they liked the knives, they both told me that rust problems were immediate with these knives. It would appear to me that expensive knives (with such a great brand name)such as these should not have this problem with rust. I was very disappointed!"
3,Rusty Stainless,"This set works great, but rust spots develop easily. It wasn't until I read other reviews that you're supposed to wipe it dry right after washing it. So being stainless stell is really pointless. I tried going to Cuisinart's website to see if I can get a refund, but no luck. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,Mostly history,"I don't know how this book came to be titled ""Prophecies"" - or Wisdom and Startling Predictions for that matter. It's more of a history of how various Native American cultures began, flourished, and ultimately were overwhelmed and destroyed, or nearly destroyed, by whites.If you want to read about Native American prophecies, predictions and/or wisdom, there are MANY better books out there than this."
1,LIMP ME,I bought this because it said it gives hair texture & body. It doesn't. It makes it limp & lifeless. this stuff is ONLY for those who have really crazy thick & unruly frizzed out hair. Because those are the only people who should be using this stuff.
1,phone case,"The phone was delivered on a timely manner, however it was missing the detachable belt clip.I recieved it a week later after contacting the seller.I was very unhappy with the product.... I had a previous MOTOROLA RAZR case and this does not appear to be the same quality. I used the original one for apprx 3-4 years and although I realize this might not be the status quo. I didn'T expect the back to separate within several days of usage so it can no longer be used as it was intended.Iam back to where I was initially, looking for a case... Lynn"
5,Basketball,The old school way to play basketball. Dave DeBusschere was one of the best forwards to play the game. His accounting of the 1970 championship series is one for the record books.
2,Get ready for a sermon,"I was looking for an informative documentary styled program, but what I ended up with was a sermon. Don't get me wrong, the research needed to deliver this message is admirable. I can only imagine how much time and resources needed to put this together. But in my opinion, the product review was better than the program itself. The video quality wasn't that great either. If you're looking for a researchable documentary, this one is not for you."
1,canterbury tales for the mook,"I love Mr. Palahniuk's books. I have and have read all of them. I have been disappointed a bit in the last couple, but this one takes the cake for disappointment.I think it is left-overs made suddenly for unexpected guests. Some of the stories are ok and have the typical Palahniuk dark sense of humor and strange humanity, but they are outnumbered by the bad tales and the silly linking/framing story.Oliver Stone can make movies almost as good as Mr. Palahniuk can write novels. What Mr. Stone was trying to say in Natural Born Killers is similiar to what Mr. Palahniuk is trying to say in Haunted. NBK is an indictment of the public's fascination with those who kill as serial killers or as thrill/mass killers. Haunted indicts a society of victims that we have become given that talkshows are now so all pervading that Tony Danza has one.So, while the indictment is prescient, the specifics fail."
1,Just no.,"Gross ,boring, poorly written schlock. This book was a struggle to finish. I really wish I could get my money back."
2,If the point was to revolt...,"If Chuck Palahniuk's intent was to disgust his reader and give a view of writers as the most depraved and soulless individuals walking the earth, then this book deserves five stars.I am a fan of some of Palahniuk's work (Fight Club, Stranger Than Fiction, Choke) but this book marks a low point in my mind. Some of the contained short stories are clever and entertaining (the rich masquerading as homeless bums), but others seem written simply to see just how vile a story could be composed. I found it tasteless and ultimately pointless in a narrative that never elicited a single emotion beyond revulsion.Don't waste your time on this one as it is neither scary nor entertaining."
4,Excellent!,"I thought the stories were great, easy to read, and always interesting. I would rate it equivalent to Diary, though not quite as good as Survivor or Choke. However, I would rate those two books as two of the best of all time."
2,Umm.... Is it me?,"Because I just don't get this book. I feel like Palahniuk was trying to send a moral message, that just got lost in blood and ""protein mud"".What could have been a great read just became a countdown of waiting for everyone to die and the book to mercifully end. I gave it two stars instead of one, because the first story ""Guts"" is pretty good, albeit a little over the top.I was a fan of Fight Club, and I guess it's possible this book is over my head, but I just can't recommend it. It isn't in the slightest scary, and once you realize that there isn't a single character worth caring about, a little boring."
1,Hm,"This book was really difficult for me to get into. The narrative, while mysterious and bold and even downright insane, is at times overshadowed by the prose, which I found to be a bit wordy and could have used some serious editing. I think because of the prose I was unable to fully immerse in the stories here. Also, there were some moments that just felt too fantastical (like a sister getting pregnant from sperm in a pool). While I usually can go along with the fantastical, it didn't seem to work as effectively here. I would have liked to see this book only with the stories of each individual character, as the interrupting chapters didn't really help me get to know the characters and it was actually quite confusing."
1,Confused,"Confused, disjointed. I could not get into the flow of this novel. Plot was way over the top and the cast of characters was endless and mindless. I certainly missed the point of the author."
4,haunted,"the novel starts off strong with the story guts. it mellows down a little... until a woman who is mistaken as dead gets her butt sliced off and cooked. the real horror comes when she comes to and eats herself.this book is very twisted and fun. it wasnt as good as fight club, but it was definatly a twisted canterbury tales!"
4,"Good, but left me wanting more","This is the first novel I've read by Chuck Palahniuk. I was prompted to purchase this book after reading a magazine interview with the writer. In the interview the writer stated that at several book readings people actually passed out at hearing his stories. I am a lover of a good horror story and this book was good, but I don't see how anyone could reach the point of losing conciousness over one of these stories. I was really hoping for something that would knock my socks off and I guess my expectations were just a little too high. All in all, though, I'm not disappointed in my purchase and I will read more of his work."
3,"Good short stories, not so good novel","Palahniuk should have just put out a collection of short stories. As stand alone short stories, these are fun to read. But, instead, he tries to weave together the short stories with a weak plot about masochistic wanna be writers who are trapped in a theater cum writers workshop. If you read it, just skip to the stories in each chapter. You won't miss a thing."
3,Palahniuk kind of falling off,"We might have gotten the best out of him if this ""novel"" is any indication. Almost seems like a money making ploy since it's an accumulation of short stories of his that have already been published, strung together with a weak narrative thread. His earlier stuff is much better."
3,nihilistic satire,"Finally finished the long slog through this book. I've read all of his other books and thoroughly enjoyed his nihilistic satire. The grossness and shock always fit into some larger message he was trying to send. The reviews by the press and other Amazon readers notwithstanding, I want to believe Pahalniuk has a message in this book as well. Again, this was a hard book to get through for me. Some of the more grotesque parts (the pool, for one) forced me to put the book down. However, I found the book to be an over-the-top commentary on celebrity worship and ""reality"" TV, among other things. I think at the end of the day Chuck is accusing us all of fostering some deep depravity hidden behind our self-delusions. This book is a big *&@!-you to all of us, and I think it's meant to be. Look back to the early reviews of Fight Club and you'll see some similar kick-back. I think time will treat this with more circumspection as a commentary on our society."
1,Terrible book,"I wasn't shocked or disgusted by the content of the book as much as I was the overall quantity. I realize it is a satire & tongue-in-cheek, but it was neither well written nor interesting. The short stories were decent at best and complete drivel at worst. The overarching story is even worse. I love horror, and heard good things about this book, but this may top the list of the worst books I've read in a long time."
1,"No effort, just a vile river of gore","This book is gross. It's like Palahniuk just sat down and wrote out all the most disgusting things he could think of, put five of those stories away so people wouldn't know he could think of that sort of thing, then put the rest in this book. At the last minute, he decided he ought to write something to string these stories together so it didn't seem so obvious that he was just writing a gore book. Halfway through I threw up in my mouth a little. A credit to his writing, I guess, but it turned me off Palahniuk for life."
2,Disappointing,"This book was not what I thought it would be. The only good thing about this book were some of the short stories, but in order to read those you had to read the boring poems and go through a storyline that was dull. Hopefully his next book will be better."
1,"Katelyn S. Miller Place, NY","Haunted was a very disturbing book. The short stories were all like beginnings to stories that aren't finished. What caught my eye was the cover that also glows in the dark. That was the only interesting thing. Chuck needs to rethink about making books with a bunch of short stories in it. If he makes another short story book, it should only contain a few short stories that are more thought out and not about the characters personal lives. The only parts that kept me interested were the parts that weren't short stories. What was really happening to the characters in the story."
2,Overated writer/overrated book,"I have read all of his books. Choke is about the opnly one worth the read. Diary and Haunted are drivel and fight club was huped to an extent that the book never lived up to.A writer that once had promise is just stuck in an endless repeating cycle of ideas and style.People keep bringing up the idea's of his books. Idea's are a dime a dozen, execution and sustaining interest are difficult. Chuck does neither.Also, quit comparing him to Vonnegut. Vonnegut is far more accomplished and insightful which places Chuck in low standing indeed because Vonnegut is also a much over-rated writer."
1,Could not get past the first story,"My first attempt to read a book by Chuck Palahniuk, and may be my last.Guess I didn't choose a good one to start with.Sweetness and light this is not.I was listening to this book on my iPod at my health club, and, after the first story, I had to listen to Beethoven's Eighth Symphony to remove the bad taste from my mouth, and that was only partially successful.My advice: Stay away. This book is poison."
1,Haunted,"Yuk!!! Worst Book I've ever read - I read alot and with alot of variety. This book stinks (too farfetched, retched, disgusting and plain weird)."
1,"Not very ""Haunted""","Call me a party pooper...but this book is terrible. Not only are the stories not scary, they aren't even suspenseful. The author completely relies on shock appeal to gain the reader's interest, and doesn't do a very good job of it. Foolish stories such as the second story, where a woman kills people by licking their feet, make me wonder how this book got published in the first place. Needless to say...I'm selling my copy on Ebay. Hopefully I'll get at least a dollar...that's all it's worth."
3,Better read as a collection of short stories.,"This was my first Palahniuk novel, though I had seen Fight Club like the rest of the world.To get right to it, the frame story is trash. It's repetitive, unrealistic, and more than anything boring. Without the stories in between chapters, the overarching tale would read something like this: ""These people thought they could get famous if they suffered. They made themselves suffer. Someone died. They suffered more. Someone died. They cut of body parts. They think they'll get famous. They suffer.""That being said, however, there are some truly good stories contained within the novel. The ""shock value"" of the stories is overplayed unless you are particularly sheltered, with perhaps ""Guts"" being the exception.I would suggest you pick up this book and read it as a collection of short stories, and consider the pages in between to be decoration."
2,"Nope, don't bother","A very huge miss. I have no idea how the person below me can agree with me yet give it 4 stars. There are 3 or so short stories that vary from good to great, but the writers retreat tale and the rest of the shorts are awful. Just not good at all. And you know that Chuck thing, where he repeats things for effect? Very annoying in here, VERY."
3,3 1/2 stars,"The group of writers assembled in this novel would seem more believable if he put them on the bus directly form the insane asylum. This would make there behavior more on track.As mentioned by other reviewers the characters lack depth.Some of the short stories were very original and entertaining and the some of the images it created were quite qraphic. I must admit I was entertained by quite a few of these shorties. The oddity of the characters and there impulses, is what I couldn't quite muster."
1,ICK!,"Okay, I liked Fight Club so I thought this book would be good and it didn't even come close. What a waste of time. Yes some of the stories were good but you could not identify with the characters and you really just want the book to end. The book began with the story ""Guts"" which kept me on the edge of my seat and I was thinking ""I hope the rest of the stories are like this one"" but they were not. The book was not scary either. And the discription on the back of the book is misleading. It says the captor holds them up for 3 month and witholds food, water and heat and that is far from the truth. The characters in the book destroy all their food and the furnace. I would not waste my time reading this one."
2,"Umm, the point is what, exactly?","Inventive in its own disgusting way, but ultimately vile and pointless. I doubt I'll read another of his books..."
1,"Pointless, grotesque waste of time and money","If you're a fan of detailed disembowelment, sickening depictions of strange sexual perverions, and lots of blood, this is for you.The author promises a novel that will build anticipation as the characters become more desparate in their situation. He fails. Instead he moves from gore to more gore, all in an effort to scare the reader. This is not a ""haunting"" book, it's a disgusting one.I cannot fathom how this book got on the best seller list. Save your money, the dollar store will be offering it on a buy 1 get 9 free deal soon."
2,"Interesting Concept, But Mostly Disappointing","""Haunted"" has some fantastic, classic Palahniuk moments that made me laugh and cringe and feel sympathy all at once (St. Gutfree's story, for example). However, overall, this book is pretty weak. As other reviewers have noted, the short stories are very good, but the main plot that is supposed to bind them into one, cohesive novel just didn't work for me. On its own, this is not an outstanding read. Compared to ""Fight Club,"" it's barely worthy of sharing shelf space."
3,This is book is riduculous,I bought this book last year from Border's and man Chuck has a deterred mind. This book was just as graffic as Snuff. Guts was the most graffic literature I have ever read. Along with the Agent Tattletale. Palaniuk illutrates a morbid and sexually preverse image of human beings that have come together on horrific circumstances. Many of Palaniuk's stories are about people who have a significantly damaged background. Beware of the Palaniuks series. FYI: there is a movie in the making for this book.
5,Chuck is a Literary Genius!,"Awesome book sure to keep you flipping the pages! Lots of twist and brain twirls! Great book if your tired of the same old run of the mill books of the same genre. just remember to expect anything from this guy, nothing is out of bounds for Palahniiuk. ENJOY:)"
3,Weird but interesting,"There are a LOT of characters in this book, which might be a little overwhelming to some readers. Each character is introduced not by their real names, but by nicknames (EX: Earl Of Slander, Director Denial, Comrade Snarky.)They each tell a story, and through these stories you learn a little bit more about them, and most of these are things you might not want to have ever known. A lot of the stories are actually very interesting and shocking, though there was one or two that bored me so I skipped them.""Haunted"" is an okay book. It's got its good moments, and then it has its bad moments. But mostly it's just weird. And unbelievable. I mean, would YOU cut off a part of your body to make a good scene for a movie or show? Here's a hint, the characters in this story are more than willing to. I guess you could say they all lost their mind."
4,Unmistakably Palahniuk,"Arguably, Chuck Palahniuk's greatest strength comes from an unforgiving presentation of whatever subject he tackles. He has never been one to flinch from using such sensitive topics as SIDS (Lullaby) or hijacking airplanes (Survivor) to create fresh, original plots and McGuffins, and Haunted is not an exception. For those fortunate enough to read the early excepts will not be disappointed: the intensity of Haunted keeps impressive pacing and twists to the very end. For those not familiar with Chuck's work, be forewarned that much of this novel is over the top presentation and not for those easily offended or disgusted. All of this said, though, Haunted seems to suffer from the same feeling of trying too hard that plagues some of Palahniuk's other work. After a few segments, the constant parade of shock begins to numb the work, keeping it from reaching greatness. Still, if you love Chuck or think you can stomach it, Haunted is well worth the time."
1,Waste of time,"Skip it. There's maybe two good stories, I found that where I thought the main plot was going was FAR more interesting and creative than where the story actually WENT, I browsed the chapters b/c the charcters bored me to tears, I hated everyone (but not in a Humbert Humbert way - not hate enough to be engaged) and DIDN'T CARE. The last real ""short story"" was good. Otherwise, a waste of time."
1,"We get it, you're telling disgusting stories","Let me start by saying, I'm a big fan of Chuck. I've read numerous books by him, and enjoyed them all - except this one. I couldn't even finish this book, and not because it was too shocking, or because I have a delicate sensibility. It was just too much of the same thing, and it started to feel like a one-trick pony: disgusting story, stupid poem. It just got so old, with cliche, revolting characterization, and a plot that takes two sentences to sum up. I read Palahniuk for his riveting storylines and his social commentary. I don't, however, want to read him trying to one-up himself for an entire novel. If you're a first time Chuck Palahniuk reader, don't pick this book. Read Rant, Invisible Monsters, Survivor, or any other one really. Those will give you a better idea of what kind of writer he is. This one's just a radar blip."
2,It just doesn't do it for me,"I have heard this book referred to as black comedy, horrific and with numerous other adjectives. I mostly found it sad and depressing. The most encompassing theme I could surmise is that people love misery and that humanity is anything but humane. Still, the book was a surprise to me. For all the positive reviews, I still don't get it. Except for one or two stories, revulsion wasn't even a dominant aspect. I found little if any humor. I gave it a two-star rating because at times the writing was quite good, but even that was very uneven. Not recommended."
3,"Grotesque, you won't forget this book soon","""Writer's retreat. Get away from the world and concentrate on your book that will win the Pullitzer!"" This is what a group of about 15 writers are told when they sign on for a weird and wacky ""retreat"". Some of the most grotesque, strange and mind-sticking stories ever told. Gut-Free. What does that bring to mind? You won't believe the story behind it. (think pool pump.) And the mystery machine people can look in and it ""steals"" all their joy. A talented writer, but over-the-top for me in a lot of places. When the writers begin to kill and eat each other, I'd about had it, but I had to read on to see if there were any more gem stories."
4,Short Stories are Great,"These are some of the best short stories I've ever read. The overall story isn't that great, but it's worth it just for the short stories. Some of them are just so damn good I was just amazed. Some of my favorites are: Slumming, Swan Song, Exodus, Civil Twilight, Product Placement,and The Nightmare Box. Twisted, sick, funny, and just brilliant writing. Definitely recommended."
5,Must Read,This is the first book I have read from this author and it has made me buy more oh his books. This has great little stories that tie into the main plot. It is full of laughs. I have bought this for a few of my friends to read because it is that good.
5,Chuck weaved a series of short stories together into one great story,Chuck is easily my favorite author.this collection of short stories (each can stand alone) is woven together to make one great twisted story.a fun and easy read!
1,I am haunted by how bad this book was...,"This book missed on every level. The characters were not fleshed out in any way that made their choices even remotely plausible... I know that this book is meant to be a commentary on reality TV, etc., but it completely missed the mark. Just a terrible book. It was only through my own stubborness (I can't leave a book unfinished) that I read it through to it's conclusion. Which by the way, was just as stupid as the rest of the book."
2,Trying too hard,"You can always tell when someone is writing a book just to be artsy. What was great about Fight Club, Choke and Diary is that they were simply written and could be enjoyed. With Haunted he seemed to go out of his way to make this book unenjoyable to read. Take Catcher in the Rye, a great book, maybe one of the best, and yet any 8 year old could make their way through it. A book does not have to be wordy and written in a style that makes your head hurt. There are so many people that read books like this only so that they can brag about reading them and put up a front that they are far more intellegent then anyone else. Give me a book that I want to read, and enjoy reading anytime."
5,"Unique, Hilarious, Poetic, Incredible","I kept forgetting that i was Brett, so i wasn't answering, so they went back to Karl. Things never live up to what you want. Dreams, what are they?"
3,A cast of characters,"You have to wonder what Chuck Palahniuk must be like in person...so many characters with issues, a very creative plot."
1,Crap,"Amateur fantasy, immature, bizzaro, unreal, false, unrealistic, non-believable, absurdest, gross, nonsensical, crap. Don't even recommend finishing it. Disappointing to the bad ending."
2,bummer,"I was REALLY looking forward to reading this book. The first chapter was incredible, but it was all downhill from there. The chapters are usually split into three parts. A segment of the main story, a poem about one of the main characters, and then a short story written by the same character. You learn about the characters through the short stories. The problem with this structure is that some of the chapters dedicated to the characters don't happen until 3/4 of the way through the book, so as your reading the main story you have no connection or background to the characters.This book is also gratuitous in it's use of disturbing imagery. I'm a 27 year old man, so I don't mind violence and stomach churning passages, but only if they're relevant to the story and not just disturbing for disturbance's sake.I would not recommend."
2,Not overly concerned with fact...,"I really wanted to like this. The first short story, ""Guts"", was wonderfully disturbing and I was looking forward to reading more in the same vein. Unfortunately, all of the others stories paled in comparison and left me feeling let down. I pushed to read the whole novel just in case there was another knock-out story and was further dissapointed. Many stories started out as promising and fizzled at the end. The wrap-around story had far too many characters and their complaining all made them sound like the same person.Several of the stories contained premises that would fall through in the ""real world"" because the facts contained within were incorrect. I was thrown out of the story by events that would not have happened due to reality. I understand suspending belief but it happened so often it made the writing seem lazy.I will be trying another Palahniuk book, but I am not as eager as before."
2,Shock Value,"I've heard a lot of really wonderful things about this author, particularly Fight Club, but most of this book was only good for the shock value. Haunted was not very well written, and frankly, I feel like my vocabulary has shrunk after reading this.I probably disliked it so much due to the high expectations that I had. The book is not awful, I simply don't agree with the fact that Chuck Palahniuk is one of the contemporary greats of literature. He just writes a lot of gross stuff, which I guess my generation is into.It was just sorely disappointing to open Haunted expecting a true work of art, and finding random descriptions of intestines, or blood. Not that I don't appreciate a good horror story, I just like for my stories to rely on good writing as opposed to ""shock"" content."
2,a collection of short stories,"I did like this book. Why didn't I rate it higher? I bought it expecting a novel. What I got was a collection of short stories. While several of the chapters were wonderful, truly bizarre, others were . . . Well, my mama always told me - if you can't say something nice, shut your big old trap. If you're looking for bizarre imagery, with a great, crime-filled plot (I came across a real gem a couple weeks back) check out The Hollow Man by G. Patrick Huskins.The Hollow Man: A (Transgressive) Novel Of Suspense"
5,GHOSTLY VISIONS LINGER,"I'm not sure what the negative criticism surrounding this book is about. I absolutely loved Haunted and feel this is Chuck's best work since Invisible Monsters. The short stories here are 75% stellar, leaving the remaining 25% mid-grade. To me, that's pretty pleasurable. The short story entitled ""The Nightmare Box"" is quite chilling and still rests with me. I also enjoyed the primary tale inbetween the short stories, finding the characters and scenarios dark, clever, and amusing. In all, this book is definately not for the faint at heart, but then again, we expect Chuck to be shocking. This is what he does best."
4,Started ok. . .. got disgusting and finished well,"So I guess to a greater or larger extent reading Haunted is like going out and getting stinking drunk, puking, and finally feeling relived its over.This book is perhaps his best or his worst - I haven't quite decided. It is a times very funny, very poignant, and very sick. I think that Chuck got lazy with this book."
3,Decent but it's more gruesome that compelling.,"While I was a fan of the Fight Club novel, I found that the latest novel from Chuck Palahniukis not in the same league. It's more gruesome than a real page-turner and it will keep you from finishing it from days at a time. Maybe Mr Palahniuk had a better thing in mind while he was writing this novel but other than the short stories that are told (which is where the book excels in) the main characters were not very interesting and the whole concept is taken from the folklore on how Mary Shelly created her story Frankenstein but with out the compelling drama or the intelligence that make it such a contemporary classic.Worth a look if you have nothing to read but be prepare to be grossed out more than entertained."
2,Ha ha but now what?,"He writes like Dan Brown, or Grisham, not very well and with a certain predicted outcome. Yeah yeah, he's gotten lots of press. So what. That doesn't a great writer make.It looked nice, it tempted, but ultimately -- shallow. You know that bad taste poor writing leaves in your mouth, that haunting feeling that you might have spent your time more wisely....?"
1,Shocking,"The cannibalism wasn't shocking, neither was the 6-inches left of intestine, or the doubled-over piece of wax... the self-mutilations weren't shocking either... nor the baby-stew. What was most shocking was my inability to suspend belief. Mistaking pregoria for a septuagenarian... well, then these people, these figures away at this writer's retreat, are really too stupid to live. Furthermore, the belief that they will find financial gain in how they suffered is completely foolish. If these people were the most jaded, as proposed, then they'd understand such shock value would only carry them through a week... maybe a month, only to be replaced by something more absurd, pathetic and disturbing.Chuck Palahniuk has written some fine novels, has had some great plotting devices and interesting character development. In Haunted, though, these attributes are absent."
1,Stinks...,"Palahniuk, like many successful authors before him, seems to have been pressured by his publisher to release a sub-standard collection of short stories in time for summer. Many offenses here (poor taste, repetitive stories, flat characters), but the worst is that it is all very boring. I kept wondering why I should keep reading - who cares about these characters? With barely a single thrill in the book, Haunted is nothing but a cheap device to string together a series of undeveloped observations and anecdotes - all with excessive gore to churn your stomach. He tried to outdo his previous work resulting in is his weakest effort yet. It just stinks."
1,One of the dreariest reads of the summer,"Like lemmings to the sea, best seller groupies flocked to the bookstores to buy this ripoff. The first story had some shock value, but the book went steadily down hill after that. The short stories are weak, the narration excruciatingly boring. If you really want thrills I suggest the telephone directory."
1,"Gross, Stupid, and Pointless","It's been a few years since I read this book. Written at the height of 'reality show fever' that seemed to grip the US. This book dealt with a bunch of people thrown together and locked up together for an extended period and then it dealt with the depths to which they'd all sink while in this place.The book was completely stupid and pointless to the extreme. I remember such things as a CPR doll being ""used"" by some antagonists (imply what you want by ""used"") and razor blades being put into the thing to get revenge on said antagonists. I remember someone being eaten, etc. There was absolutely no point to the book other than to try and gross out the reader. Honestly crappy stuff.Waste of money and time."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"By far, this is one of the stupidest books I have ever read and I read about one book per week. Had I not been bored to death on an airplane, I never would have finished it. If you are half way through, you can stop reading because there really is no point to the book. This book is about a group of idiots who self mutilate, cannibalize and murder so they can be famous. As if that is not enough, each character in the book also shares a short story about mutilation, murder and isolation. In most cases,the details are gory and unpleasant This horrid book adds new meaning to the word unnecessary."
1,One of Palahniuk's Worst Books,"While I have enjoyed many of Chuck Palahniuk's books (particularly ""Lullaby"" and ""Diary""), ""Haunted"" is just plain bad. The short stories almost labor to reach a conclusion, and the connecting narrative is ridiculous after the first few chapters.Chuck Palahniuk is a very good writer, but this book is not up to standards. If you are looking for a Palahniuk book to read try Fight Club, or Survivor, or Lullaby, or Diary, but not Haunted."
3,My Haunted Experience.,"This book starts out with a bang gets a little slow in the middle then finishes pretty strong.It's disturbing, gross and riveting. There is something about how Palahniuk writes that's very detailed and visual.It seems he did a lot of research up front on medical terminology that makes certain aspects more believable.Some stories have predicable outcomes but others, like the Earl of Slander's caught me off guard.I liked the book and would recommend it. It is certainly not for everyone. It requires a certain palette and taste.No pun intended."
5,main story isn't really the point...,"I agree with the other reviewers in that the main story isn't all that...but I really don't think that's the point. I feel like he just wanted a way to connect his short stories and have some sort of flow, unlike, say Stranger than Fiction. Anyway, like Stranger Than Fiction, Choke, Fight Club, Survivor, Lullaby and everything else he's ever written, you need a pretty twisted sense of humor to enjoy these stories - The first story, Guts, is pretty apalling and isn't something you want your mom to find out you read for pleasure. However I, like may Palahniuk fans, was laughing my butt off at this and other stories. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Palahniuk's work - you know who you are...and I'm sure you know what to expect."
4,Both gross and intelligent,"I bought this book because it was supposed to be quite disturbing, gross and scary. It was. I did not know that it was actually a good book aside from that. This book is intelligent and amazingly written. It is also extremely gross."
4,Thanks Chuck,"...and the 1 star off just because the ending wasn't bloody enough. I loved reading Haunted. It took my mind off reality and just changed how I look at everyday chores. People are really messed up, what can only be a fragment of your imagination can easily become reality. It's good to know that I haven't figured out everything, that people who are capable of having more disgusting thoughts than I do really exist. In terms of making me feel queasy, which is why most people seem to feel that this book is bad, I think that the 140 year old vampire- teenage girl sex scene in Breaking Dawn was far more disgusting. The human mind is programmed to look at negative and positive possibilities. In this book, the negative has been enhanced into something comprehensive. Thanks Chuck."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad","I was told that Haunted was one of the books that, if you're interested in reading Palahniuk, was a must have. And, for some part of it, it is true. At least half this book is pretty good. As for the rest, well...All the poems that Chuck wrote are neat, and some of the stories are entertaining, even disgustingly so. Others are just downright stupid. And the main story itself is dull.If this were a collection of just short stories and poems, I would give it a four out of five, because most of the stories are good. However, the boring main story with the bad stories makes for half a good book."
5,Haunted,"Haunted takes you places where you never wanted to go, and once you get there you never want to leave. The characters are vivid. The plot is realistic. The world created is as real as this one. That's what makes it so scary. You get to know the characters, to feel sorry for them, to hate them, to root for the bad guy, and there are plenty of them to choose from. There's something about hiding from the world for three months and killing those around you for fame that makes you not put this down for a hundred pages at a time."
2,"""Onstage, instead of a spotlight...""","This collection of poems and quick rewinds on each characters life that lead you up to how they've come to be trapped in what appeared to be a writer's retreat - but has turned into a very sticky trap.The book rolls along, rather pleased with itself. Each character's misfortunes quickly trumped by the next person's tale. Each gross and depraved action quickly replaced (taped over in this case) as the next moment shows how much lower humanity can dip. Think about the movie SAW.The sudden Biblical departure at the end really doesn't help the fact that this story wasn't going anywhere in particular in the first place. Oh ye great first man. Oh ye great first woman.Really. All of this just an exercise for the author to play with language and ideas. It accomplishes nothing and really just plays out like an immature 'baby on a meathook' joke from 2nd grade."
4,Awesome,"I really like this book. However, Chuck should have left out the novel part and kept this as a collection of short stories. Lets face it thats the coolest part about the book. I found myself getting extremely bored in-between the stories. I do feel that I got my moneys worth just based off the crazy short stories alone. So I definately recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of Chuck P."
4,A Shocking Smorgasboard,"CP is back, and this time writes from a multitude of different points of view.It's Palahniuk ala Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Yet complete with all of his off color topics & cynicism.Poems & short stories, something we haven't really seen from him before, and overall it makes a great read, one of the best I've consumed in quite a while, but still lacking, to me, some of his earlier bravado."
1,"Starts out good, then goes downhill from there...","Having read Diary before this book, I was looking forward to another exciting and unpredictable Palahniuk novel. However, I was very disappointed.This book started out good, the gruesome stories grabbed my attention and made me want to read further, but the characters' actions turn it into a rather boring read, at least for me. I lost interest when the actions went from realistic/believable, to fake and far-fetched.I got the book 2 years ago shortly after it came out, and I've been trying to finish it ever since. I'm not even halfway through, and it's almost a chore to read."
1,BORING,"One of the worst books I have ever read. After the intial shocker in the swimming pool, I read to the end, thinking there must be more to this book. There never was. I read the authors proud description of people fainting from shock when the stories were read out loud. I can't imagine someone fainting after hearing these stories, but I guess that is what the author is proud to achieve."
1,Too bad it's this bad!,"I would really love to be able to give this book a better ranking, but I can't. It really is that terrible; which surprised me more than it annoyed me. I love Chuck Palahniuk's other books; especially Choke and Survivor, but this one just has no real redeeming qualities. In all his books the characters are somewhat terrible people or at the very least not your usual protagonists, but I ended up identifying or even liking them almost against my better judgment. In Haunted, however, there are no redeeming characters or qualities. I just hated all of them and wished they would get it over with. Basically, if you filled a room with people who embodied everything wrong and shallow about pop culture/materialism you would have this cast and therefore this plot. It may not be so bad to watch them all die, but since they are all so irritating you need it to be over with quickly. At best it should have been a short story."
1,Didn't really seem like he was trying...,"I'm a fan of most of Palahanuk's books, they are entertaining, thought provoking and original if nothing else. This book was none of those things, it was almost a parody of palahanuk's style. It was pointlessly gross, pointlessly boring, and mostly just pointless. I think he's getting lazy, I know he can do better then this mess."
4,suspend your disbelief anyway,"YES, the stories ARE gross and the plots are a bit ridiculous. But this book does not intend to convince you of its reality, it clearly states that it gets ""more and more extreme"", and this is MORE true for the main storyline, rather than the short stories. I have to say that I wasn't sure I'd be able to handle the rest of the book after reading ""Guts"" [and this is incidentally, the FIRST short story featured in here].Also... why was no-one else as sickened as I was by ""Hot Potting""? I think I must've put the book down 30 times and kept the lights on when I went to sleep. But maybe I'm one of those faint-hearted after all. I have never written a review of anything before, and my opinion of this book, is that whether you like it or hate it, you will probably feel provoked to feel something strong. To me, that's successful writing."
3,Some of the short stories are amazing.... however....,"The main story is fairly boring and unrealistic. I'll be nice and note that the main story was probably never meant to be realistic, but the events that transpire are just over-the-top and are only sometimes interesting or amusing.I am not even sure what the poems are meant to do or why they are there, but they do not really add anything to the main story, 'nor do they really set up the short stories.This is where my review gets positive. Some of the short stories are simply amazing. Stories like ""The Nightmare Box"" ""Cassandra"" ""Guts"" ""Hot Potting"" and ""The Ritual"" are really what make this book a worthwhile purchase. While some of the short stories remain over-the-top ""Foot Work"" ect., they are atleast entertaining and add a depth of playful fantasy.This is not a very good novel, but has some great short stories and good moments."
3,a little dull,"I was dissapointed with this book. The main plot line was slow moving and disjointed -- maybe I just wasn't smart enough. I did enjoy the short stories they were filled with Palaniuk's usual ""fun facts"" and were concise so you didn't get too lost. I have to say, Invisible Monsters is still my favorite!"
4,Entertaining,"This book was a great read. The short stories integrated with a main story made this book interesting and entertaining. I had to put the book down and catch my breath after reading ""Guts."" Disturbing and excellent!"
4,"Chuck is back, for his audience","Chuck is back with his shock, his collection of odd facts, his weirdo characters. If you have been somewhat let down with the formulaic delivery of his last couple of books, try Haunted. If you are not totally repulsed by chapter 1, then you have become inured to his caustic wit, move on to something else."
5,Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk,"Very bizarre, offbeat, but very good. Kept me reading to see what else was going to happen. I would have preferred a better ending, but overall, I recommend it. I am getting ready to read a previous novel of Palahniuk's, ""Choke""."
4,Minus One Star for the Unimaginative Title,"I'm not one for hero worship or idolizing people whether they be writers, saints or my grandmother, and I have no desire to meet Chuck Palahniuk, attend a signing or write him a letter, but I do respect and admire his talent, and if I could be one writer other than myself, I would be Chuck Palahniuk. I hope he continues to write novels that inspire the kind of polarization apparent in the reviews I'm reading. Whether or not you care for the toilet humor and grotesque imagery is a matter of personal taste and he certainly isn't a writer for everyone, but you can't make any kind of honest statement about humanity without shining a light into the darkest corners, and if you can make them laugh out loud along the way, I call that genius. If you want a populist author hero, go buy the new Harry Potter. I hear it's really dark too."
3,Not So Haunted,"Although I have truly loved all of Palahniuk's previous books, this particular work was somewhat disappointing.The novel is composed mostly of short-stories told by the characters of the main plot, who have become willing victims to an old man's scheme to assist them in writing about their darkest secrets. However, the novel in itself is loosely structured, and the characters lack depth.Yes. You will get the shock value you've come to expect from Palahniuk's other works. But, unlike his previous books, there doesn't seem to be a method behind the madness.It's an entertaining read, but it will leave you with many unanswered questions."
2,A disappointment,"First off, I am a huge Palahniuk fan. I've read every work of fiction he's written and was really excited for this latest addition. Long story short, it left me disappointed. It wasn't a bad book, per se, but definitely did not measure up to the likes of Survivor, Invisible Monsters or any of the rest, for that matter. A lot of the time it felt like he was being over the top simply for the sake of it... like it's expected of him now, so he needed to take it to the next level.The cleverness and plot twists we have come to expect from Palahniuk were essentially non-existent, and though there were some interesting short stories in there, most seemed to focus only on getting a disgusted reaction from readers."
1,Good short stories ruined by dull narrative,"The short stories are good, but the narrative that binds them together is dull, tedious and over the top. Forget the reviews that discuss the gore, it's irrelevant. It's the narrative that I've a beef with -- it feels like the author thought he needed something to tie the short stories together but didn't care enough to write anything interesting. I'm a book addict, no doubt about it. I've read at least two books a month for the past 30 years, from classics to bestsellers. But this one goes into the category, with only a handful of others, of not worth my time to finish. What a waste of time and money."
1,AWFUL,"Wow, was that awful. I completely lost interest about halfway through. The main conceit is uninspired. The characters were not even one-dimensional. The short stories were an improvement, but Harlan Ellison did it better decades ago. So in fact did almost any old Twilight Zone episode.Gory in a completely uninteresting way. I never thought I'd say this, but even Bret Easton Ellis is better in that respect."
1,If I told you I threw up in the first chapter...,"how would you feel?? The very first chapter of the book titled ""guts"" made me physically throw up which has never ever happened to me before. I pride myself in having an odd and somewhat disturbing collection of books, but this... this was something else! this book follows a group of auhtors who are living under the same roof for the purpose of novel writing. I have read many a chuck palanuik book including; fight club, survivor, and invisible monsters none of which disturbed me even half as much as this book. This was my last palanuik read! From what I hear from other fellow fans his writing has only gotten more grotesque from here! So no thank you I draw the line in the sand here and no farther!"
1,Going for the shock value,"I didn't find this book that good. I had read 'Fight Club' and loved it and was hoping to get the same experience from this book, but that was not the case. Honestly, I felt like the writer was trying to be as disgusting as possible, going for total shock value. I also didn't feel that the book flowed very well. I'd really like to read some of his other books but hope that they aren't like this one."
2,Palahniuk jumps the shark,"It pains me to say this, but this is easily the weakest book Palahniuk has written. It caps off a downhill slide that began with Lullaby and continued with Diary. I think Chuck needs to take a break and re-focus if he's going to keep the ""our generation's Don DeLillo"" title. First time readers are better off investing their time in either Survivor or Fight Club."
5,haunted,"I am in love with Palahniuk's work, and this was no exception. Interesting twist, but when hasn't there been one from this author? I was not disappointed"
5,What a great book!!,"Chuck Palahniuk has done it yet again in this amazing collection of bone chilling stories. I couldn't put the book down once i opened it, it's incredible! Anyone with a weak stomach should avoid this though."
3,Just OK.,"Quite honestly, I expected more from the author of Fight Club. This book was weird and just kind of gross. It had some sort of a story going on which was interesting enough for me to finish it, but really it seemed designed for people who just like reading really gory descriptions with a plot that doesn't go anywhere. The characters aren't really likeable and the ending is unsatisfying, partly because you don't really even care what happens. It's readable if you don't have a weak stomach, but it's definately nothing to write home about. If you're bored and have nothing else to do you'll probably get through it. But if there's something good on TV....maybe not."
4,TVOD Electronica!!!,"Industrial music and the scene that surrounds it is dead. It's been dead for a very long time, too. However Television Overdose isn't really industrial. It's probably better classified inside some category between electronic body music and ""techno."" It's a good listen, and I'm almost certain that those still grabbing for what is left of industrial music will enjoy it, and it might open a few doors for those that have never heard of electronic body music. My favorite track is probably ""Information is Power."" A good solid and heavy drum beat with tons of electronics bouncing around in the mix."
3,The Best Of Stray Cats,"Stray cats was and still is the worlds biggest rockabilly-band. During the 80's the record many hits and one of the biggest was ""Rock This Town"", and that's the best song also! This album shows some of the best songs but some of them is gone! If you wan't the best album i recommend ""Rockabilly Rules""(Only Live-preformance) and ""Stray Cats Strut""(The Ultimate Album)! Keep rockin' kids!"
1,Not comfortable,"While the sole is very comfortable, the side straps were far too tight and dug into my toes. I am a true size 8.5 medium and rarely have trouble wearing shoes that I have ordered online. I had hoped that the leather would eventually stretch a little but that never happened. I wound up giving the pair to Goodwill. The shoes were so cute but very uncomfortable."
5,"Beautiful, soft, wonderful fit...",This is any amazing sandal-it feels like I am walking on a cloud-conforms to my foot..I love it!
1,But not for me.......,"I was looking forward to reading another work that put you into the ""mind of a cat"". There were some clever bits that did just that. however, I felt like I had gone back to a college literature critique course. Most of the text has to do with the author's college professor peers.For me, it became a chore and I found myself trying to skip from cat sequence to cat sequence and skipping the critiques of the authors' peers. I don't often do this, but I gave up on the book."
3,Interesting stories though a cat,Found that the book can be amusing just reading the stories through the mind of a cat but seemed to become boring. Couldn''t keep with the book. Translated book.
5,Wonderful,"I bought the three volume set of this book in 1994 and found it mildly amusing.Now that I'm in academia, I find this book hilarious. It is a fine sendup of pretentious intellectualism--and though there are specifically Japanese references, the humor is universal. Or rather, university-al."
4,An amusing look modernizing Japan through a cat's eyes,"Contemporary social issues have always been tackled by Japanese novelists, notably Natsume Sseki (1867-1917), who exemplified his mastery doing just that in the short story form. In I Am A Cat, he personified a stray cat, mundanely observing the lives of ordinary people in a society rank with hierarchy. The cat sips milk, flirts with the neighborhood female feline, but also spends exorbitant amounts of time quietly pondering the tiny tragedies of bipedal giants looming above - from the tatters in his owner's coattails to a houseguest's mindless aping of Western customs. In my opinion, this book is best enjoyed in bite-sized morsels, one vignette at a time, as it was originally written in installments."
1,Another worthless set,"They simply don't work. Well, you can almost hear something from one walkie-talkie if you are a couple of feet away from the other one. Unfortunately, the sound of the person actually talking is louder than what comes through the set. I will be rescuing the 8 AAA batteries in those pieces of junk after my daughters get tired of pretending they work tonight."
1,biggest piece of crap don't buy,I bought these for my daughter last year for X-mas. They barely work and are flimsy plastic. We used them once and the battery was dead. Please don't waste your money on these.
1,They don't work,My daughter saved her money and bought them from a local store. Got home and they did not work. I called the company and they said they would send a new pair. They arrived in the mail yesterday after she waited 6 weeks. These work but only if you stand next to each other. I wish we had read the other reviews before making this purchase.
1,Don't waste your money!,"These are horrible! My 3 yr old daughter got these as a Christmas gift & was so excited when we told her what they were. Only one works, but it has loud static coming out of it. So I have 2 walkie talkies that do nothing! My daughter was so dissapointed when she realized they didn't work. I am glad I didn't buy these, but if I did they would be going back! Plus there is no phone number to call so we're probably throwing them away...what a shame! Don't waste your money!!"
1,big waste of money,"This toy is awful. My daughter was so exited to get it, yet she can not comunicate through it. What a waste of money.Somebody should ban to sell toys like that."
1,No Joy In This Toy - Zero Stars!!!!,"This whole toy is a waste of time and money. I totally agree with everyone else, do they even test these products anymore? And Disney? You think they would care about their branding (which is erroding, as far as I am concerned)."
1,dissapointment,"My daughter LOVES the disney princesses. When our Toys R Us was going out of business, we bought 2 of these. One for her & one for my niece. (...)it wasn't worth, we haven't had them work yet. I should have read the reviews. And I can't even return them! UGHHH!!"
1,"Static, Static, Static",Static is about all you can hear on these. These are terrible walkie talkies. Save your money and get something different than these.
1,Ugh.....waste of money,"They work *only* when my daughter and I stand no further than a foot away and POINT the walkies towards each other. Even then, the sound is poor.A total waste of money! I mean, how much fun can walkie talkies possibly be if you have to be standing nose to nose??"
1,Walkie Talkies,What a BIG disappointment. They simply don't work. You can barely hear the other person even a few feet away and the static is horendous. My daughter wanted these for her birthday and her little heart was broken.
1,The worst ever!,In case it wasn't clear from the other reviews - DON'T waste your money! Wish it were possible to give ZERO stars. They just don't work. The worst ever. Very sad
1,They don't work!,My 4 year old received this for her birthday and they do not work! The static is so loud that the kids can't hear anything else.
1,THESE DO NOY WORK MORE THAN INCHES AWAY,VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT... BOUGHT IT SO WHEN MY G' DAUGHTER WAS IN MY BEDROOM AND I IN OUR FAMILY ROOM IF WE NEEDED EACH OTHER OR I WANTED TO CHECK ON HER I COULD ... DID NOT WORK.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE...
1,RUN !!!!,"I bought this toy as a gift for a little girl who loves everything disney princess and it didn't work. She had to stand toe to toe with us in order to get any reception which of course defeats the purpose. I apoligized profusely to the mom. Thank god I included a gift receipt. If you get this toy free, throw it away!"
3,Hummingbird stamped cross stitch kit,The picture is beautiful but print is very light and hard to see at places.
3,Black dust?,"When I bought a package of these, there was all this black dust on the outside of each of the cups, my hands was covered with what looked like black ink (easy to wash off though).The noodles themselves were average."
3,"The game is pretty cool, but it's kind of short.","The game is a good game for the fans of the show. You can use all the spells from the show even with a little extra. There aren't that many characters you can be (14 characters) and they're easy to unlock, There's only two main modes being story mode and time attack, and there's only fighting and nothing else. 2 player mode is really fun because it's cool if both of the players are good at the game. There is only one character that can't use spells and that's Ponygon. If you're a Zatch Bell fan I suggest you get the other game, Mamodo Fury. It's a lot more fun."
4,A better choice,"In contrast to textbooks that spend an enormous ammount of paper on outlining the very principles vaguely, this book gets to the point. It is a much better choice that for instance Munowitz's ""Principles of Chemistry"" as it is better illustrated and gives betterexplained examples. It has some weaknesses, but it is a real Chemistry book, that might prove useful doing chemical problems. For a really interested person it is not a bad choice."
3,"Useful, if not on a quantum basis","Principles of Modern Chemistry's strength is that it is well illustrated with very useful graphs, and provided a good overview of basic chemistry throughout most of its contents. The narrative generally followed logically and clearly, if not always in-depth enough. However, when it came to quantum mechanics, the explanations were quite lacking and the structure was rather muddled. Around chapter 15, the book really ceased to be satisfactory, and it would be more efficient to simply skim the illustrations."
2,"chem major from S. Hadley, MA","This book does a decent job of outlining the 'principles', but fails to draw concepts together in a way that would make the subject more understandable to beginning chemistry students."
1,Very confusing,"This textbook is supposed to be an introductory textbook. However, from the explanations in the textbook, it seems to be written for students who have already had taken general chemistry. The examples are not helpful for solving the problems and the explanations are very wordy and can even be convoluted at times. The ordering of the material is also very confusing and not helpful for most chemistry students. The only good things is that it has lots of problems and they are useful for learning the material."
1,Horribly written book.,"The concepts of this book are horribly constructed in convoluted sentences. Oxtoby may have been a genius, but he certainly could not teach, nor could he write in a manner that is both complete and simple.Also, this book is full of backwards logic wherein Oxtoby continually argues that chemical principles are true because a graph or math equation says so, rather than explaining how the principle (through experimental evidence) leads to a mathematical understanding. And although this may ""offer"" a more advanced, or complete analysis of these properties than other books may, he consistently fails to provide an adequate fundamental explanation before going further.This should have been ghost-written by someone more competent in clear, English prose."
4,Pretty Good,"I never actually used this book; I TAed for a class that used it. I ended up reading alot of it and thought that it was pretty good, but didn't cover all the math and derivations that were used in the course. Its a good book for basic general chemistry, but it does not explain the math very well. I also wouldn't reccommend it for students who have never taken chemistry at all because its probably too advanced. Take home message: its a more advanced general chem book, but fails miserably in explaining the math."
1,It deserves 0 - if not negative stars,"Note: I'm 18. I am using this book for my Chemistry class at Berkeley and I must say that this is a terrible book. It makes no sense and the problems in the back are very difficult because reading the book will not help you answer them. The book does cover a lot, however, because I cannot find a reference book to help me understand this book that covers the same material."
2,"this is a science textbook, not history textbook, so please don't go on and on with the history","well, he talks about lots and lots and lots of experiments. I hate this book"
2,I Love Rachelle Ferrell But CD SKIPS!,"I love Rachelle Ferrell's music. This is my second time purchasing this CD, because I wore the first one out! I had no problems with my first CD. However, this CD skips once or twice on every other song, which is very annoying! Also, the CD case arrived cracked. I am a frequent, usually happy Amazon customer. But this purchase was not up to the usual standards of Amazon."
2,Showing promise ...................,"The site review puts her in the same company as Anita Baker. That's just laughable. She has a nice voice which is unusually deep, but there's plenty of work to do before she can stand next to Anita."
5,THE QUINTESSENTIAL VOCALIST,"I am a 19 year old male, that's not really an all out jazz fan, BUT when I heard for the first time ""With Open Arms"" I was thrown back, it was something I've never heard. I knew I had to buy this album. This woman was Rachelle Ferrell. I excitedly bought this album and literally, it is one of the best C.D's I own. Her range is unlike you've ever heard. Her style seems to be of her own, but yet you still hear some of the classics her in her voice. I can't express enough how much of a good buy this is. I paid way more and do not regret it. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES TRUE MUSIC!!"
5,Gets Better With Time!,"Although this cd is almost 20 years old.....I STILL LOOOOOVE IT! If only a lot of the overrated singers of today had a tenth of her talent! Whew! This lady can sang! It is a cd I can listen to over and over again and never get sick of hearing it. I enjoy the mix of chill out, upbeat and sentimental songs. Her voice is clear and distinct. Even if you can't sing one note this cd will make you think you can. I always sing along and swear I can hit all of her high notes! LOL!! I love the whole cd, but here is a list of my faves: Welcome to My Love, Waiting, With Open Arms, 'Til You Come Back, You Can't Get....nevermind, I love the whole thing. Buy this cd!You won't regret your decision!!!"
5,Can Not Go Wrong with Rachelle !!!,AWESOME!!!! The duet with Will was my perfect Wedding Song for my wedding! Well worth the money the entire CD is Great.
5,A good beginning,"Before Mao there was Confucius, and probably after Mao there will be Confucius. He is the central figure in Chinese social and political thought, and his prescriptions have been the rule - of -life among China's ruling bureaucracies for hundreds of years. In his small work Paul Strathern humorously chronicles the efforts of Confucius to provide an ethic of decency for a feudal world living through troubled times. The wisdom of Confucius is not meant to save the individual soul but rather to enable society to function decently. Confucius in his own life, Strathern makes clear was not exactly the model of success. And he died disappointed and far from the political office he would have liked to have held. But he left a legacy which Chinese civilization as a whole would adopt.This work gives an excellent outline of Confucius life and work. It is a good beginning for anyone who wishes to explore the subject in greater depth."
4,Wonderful!,"I don't know why this book's reviews average 3 1/2 stars. Maybe the people who bought it thought they would open it up and find a million dollars stashed inside.This book was full of incredible very easy to do ideas. I do beleive that by applying the techniques put forth in this book, anyone can make more money than they already have, and that's never a loss.The only reason I withheld one star, was that the author used the book to advertise a bunch of other services."
5,Well worth the read,"Frank Sheed is one of my favorite theology authors, and this book did not disappoint. Before describing his map, he describes the destination (Heaven), and then lays out the paths provided by the Church to get there. Well done."
4,A great read for the co-dependant novice,"Jan Silvious' book gives a very clear and easy to read definition of co-dependancy, emotional dependacy, and how the two work together to create relationships of all types (marriages, friendships, work place, parent/child) which are unhealthy for both partners, and which will eventually destroy those involved. She also gives helpful and clear suggestions for those wishing to take the path to recovery, through trust and surrender to Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. I highly recommend this book. As an ex-text book case, I can recommend this book first hand as a helpful place to begin your recovery from both co-dependancy and emotional dependancy."
4,"Little hard to read, but an excellent book on the topic!","It was hard reading it because it was a little depressing, but the content and thoroughness of it was excellent."
3,Good Book but there are better one's out there,I liked that the book continually reminded me that there is healing and to rely on God to help you through your issues. But did not go as in depth as some of the other books I have read.
5,BTG's Books Inspire and Make You Smile,"Bradley Trevor Greive is witty, hot, and so nice! We actually met BTG during his Meaning of Life tour. If you have the opportunity to see him--GO! He's traveling to Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Kansas City, Portland and Dallas. As for his other books, if The Meaning of Life is your first BTG read, check out his other titles including The Blue Day Book (more perfect than a well intentioned card), Dear Mom (my mom cried with tears of laughter, perfect for Mother's Day, mom's birthday, making up after a mother/daughter quarrel, etc), and Looking for Mr. Right (tooooo perfect --applies to married or single gals). READ THESE BOOKS!!!!"
2,Too simplistic / shallow,"Some of the photos in this book are cute, but most of the text is too simplistic and shallow. I have found many more profound thoughts to cheer me up and help me build real happiness in ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."
5,I LOVED IT!!!,"I thought(and think) that Bradly Trevor Greive is the best author. I've read all of the other reviews and most of them were either good or horrible. I think that the people who say its the most meaningless thing they've ever read and could've been written by a ten year old are missing the point. Yes, it could have been written by a 10 year old but that's what makes it so fantastic! It's simple and funny.When I saw the reviews that said the pictures were degrading animals I laughed out loud. I guess they want everyone to think that if somthing is funny then it is degrading. I thought they were extremely uplifting. After I read this book I spent my break asking the questions it asks.All in all I would recomend this book to everyone who loves to have a good laugh and enjoys some of the most siple things in life"
5,Can I rate more than 5 stars?,"This book is for anyone and everyone. The author sets the readers expectations in the intro, that this book does NOT provide answers - it is a book about questions. When I picked this book up at [local store], I found myself so overjoyed I read the entire book in the store. With useful wisdom applying to all areas of life, the book does not stress an answer or religeon or method, though it agrees with the loving happiness you will find stressed in any society or religion. Nothing metaphysical - this book is simple and may have a different meaning for each reader.The most brilliant author since Aesop."
5,Laugh out loud!,"If you enjoy animals, you will enjoy the photographs depicting them in this book. Many of the facial expressions and the statements can be attributed to bad days, sad days, and silly days! Great stocking stuffer, pick-me-up, or surprise gift. Just a little something to tell others you're thinking of them."
2,I won't purchase from independent sellers again.,"this review is in general for the independent sellers on Amazon. I purchased 8 NEW copies of The Meaning of Life by Bradley Greive from 8 different vendors. 2 of the 8 came to be in less than new condition. One had a personalized message in it. another came to me damaged - I'm guessing it became damaged during the shipment - however other than the plastic 'mailbag' it was in, there was no other packaging to protect it. The seller should have wrapped the book in something ELSE before placing it in the plastic.So, of the 8 NEW books I purchased (to give as gifts), I can only use 6. That is only 75% of my total purchase. If this isn't reason to NEVER order from the independent sellers again, I don't know what is. I'll just take my business elsewhere."
1,The Meaning of What???,"It's a shame that Bradley Trevor Greive ruined all of those beautiful photographs of animals and nature with all the little green letters at the bottom of each of the pages. I wish those letters would have been put together in a truly meaningful way instead of such a simplistic, postcard, meaningless way!!"
1,For Imbeciles Only,"If you are a modern-era airhead who cannot handle deep thought, this mindless pablum is for you. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,Not worth the money,This tiny tome is full of cute animal photographs and trite phrases about following your career dream. Definitely not worth the money.
3,The Meaning of Life,"If you are seeking the answers to life's great mysteries, you won't find them in this book.This is essentially a book containing very cute black + white photos of animals in the wild, with truisms and proverbs written throughout the pages for the purpose of meaningful inspiration.This is a fun little book, a good read on a rainy day; and probably is best if given as a gift to a friend."
2,Meaning of what?,"I was unsatisfied with this book. It is quite cliche and far more shallow than the title would imply. Maybe I expected too much, but I assumed there would be some wisdom here deeper than can be found in a Hallmark greeting card. If you're looking for an amazing book of wisdom, try 'Open Your Mind, Open Your Life' by Taro Gold."
1,Horrible waste,"What a horrible waste of paper this book is. I can't believe anyone would have the arrogance to call it the ""Meaning of Life."" Absurd! If you think Hallmark-card level of wisdom will lead you to the meaning of life, then I guess this book is for you. What a sad commentary on our culture these days..."
4,I'm glad I bought this,Biology 101 was very well done and quite interesting. I'm glad I bought the set. The man who did the series didnt overwhelm you with a lot of scientific facts and he made things pretty easy to understand. The set that I bought came with a printed study guide and this was very helpful for referring back to. I'm hoping he does another series in chemistry or something.
1,Misguided and misrepresentational,"Shouldn't this have been titled ""Theology 101"" ?This obviously has as much to do with Biological science as Paris Hilton has to do with Astrophysics. A clear attemp at bringing about confusion in order to facilitate easier indoctrination into a religious belief system.If you want to learn Biology, study Biology from an actual Biology teacher, or Scientific DVD series."
1,Brainwashing at its best.,"These dvd's go against science itself, it's another way of stating ""faith does not need any explanation or testing for the simple reason that it is faith"". I strongly discourage you from buying this product for your children, they will hate you later in life and they'll be absolutely right. God might even strike you down for it."
2,Gimick,"Don't bother with this if you are a professional looking to get dynamic fisheye shots for design projects. You have to zoom out so far that nearly half the picture is surrounded by the black tube, which you will need to crop out unless you want it in there. After you do that, you are left with a pretty mediocre shot. Quality of images did not appear to be sharp either, though that could be the camera I was using.The macro lense is worthless too."
2,Not for a Chewer!,"This was a great purchase, easy set-up and great for traveling. Unfortunately this was not a good purchase for the dog who is smart enough to chew his way out. My Golden Retriever chewed along the zipper and broke free."
4,Senft LT Stirling Book,"Cover construction of a 6 1/2"" low temp Stirling engine. Explains the concepts behind the design decisions. A little math shown in the text but not much.If you want to understand the Low Temp Stirling and then build an example that will run on the heat of your hand in a cool room, this will do that if you build carefully. Requires a lathe to make the parts.Well worth the money."
4,stirling engines,"this was my first experence with buying online and it was very pleasing the info and help was good easy to understand and everything was what i ordered and what i expected i will definitly order again thank you anyone interested in stirling engines design, theory, or construstion, this is the place to go"
1,The NEW Flower Expert (Millennium Edition),"Though I tried to order this book THREE times, I was sent instead The Flower Expert each time.The web site shows THE NEW FLOWER EXPERT.... but do you actually have it in stock? After the second wrong book was received, with the outdated/older edition, I called a customer service representative. She personally called shipping to be sure that I would receive the correct edition. Guess what? I got the same old title back again.Do you have a bunch of i---ts working in shipping?I am unable to review the book as I have not received the one I ordered.(and after three tries, yes you have worn me down) I figure this was a bait and switch.?????????????????Oh, and contact us doesn't work. How does one get attention to detail and the correct item sent?????e"
4,Great book,"Everything you need to know briefly on this topic is in this book. I am an Industrial Design student exploring this topic. This book was appropriate for what I needed. However, it does not have many illustrated examples of what they are describing. But the literary aspect of it is all you will need."
3,Bridget's Review,"Paul has inherited his family estate. When his wife gives birth to a son, they are proud to have someone to pass to him the family name and all luxuries and responsibilities that go along with it, even if he is a bit of an ass. Paul is unhappy that his wife has only given him one son. He ends up having another son by his mistress, who feels that he should be the one left in charge. As the hate brews, the brothers become lost in it.I liked this book. The sibling rivalry was entertaining. Some parts could have been condensed but other than that, it's a winner."
4,The LifeStyles Ultra Sensitive Lubricated Latex Condoms With ...,The LifeStyles Ultra Sensitive Lubricated Latex Condoms With Spermicide worked very well. Easy to use and no problems. The extra protection provided with the spermicide gives additional confidence in the protection. I'd recommend this product to my friends and family and I'll purchase it in the future.
4,Lifestyles Ultra Sensitive With Spermicide latex condoms are ...,Lifestyles Ultra Sensitive With Spermicide latex condoms are a little more comfortable and natural feeling than some other condoms while offering a little extra security. The best feature of Lifestyles condoms is the package Color-Coding System to simplify identifying your selection from the many varieties available.
3,"Good story, but could be better","This book is a fair beginning to what I hope will be a series of novels based on the Traveller's Universe. The story adheres very close to the role-playing game's setting and texture. As a long time fan of Travellers, I liked the plot although the editing mistakes at times are a bit distracting. The story moves at a good pace, but is slow in some places due to wordy dialogues and for readers who are familiar with Travellers' jargons will find the pre-requisite explanation to non-Traveller readers a bit redundant. Overall, a good first attempt."
1,this weak attempt to revisit Traveller RPG is juvenile,"This weak attempt to revisit Traveller RPG is juvenile in its plot, characters, and action. The original game is a classic and many friends still regale the fun had with the game; this book's attempt to capture the flavor of the RPG experience is lacking in depth and originality. Poorly named characters with hokey sounding objectives seem like a corny kick at the can."
1,The editors dropped the ball on this one . . .,"Reading Peirce Askegren's novel ""Gateway to the Stars,"" set in Marc Miller's ""Traveller"" universe, claims to be the first Traveller book. Unfortunately, this is more of a threat than a treat.This book is poorly written, with poor structure, poor word choices, and poor characters. The story is more than adequate, but the execution should have been.Given all that, I still think old fans of the ""Traveller"" RPG will enjoy reading this book, even if it seems to contradict much of the source material.Clearly the editors have failed to do their job here, given several obvious errors up to and including the following, ""The Traveller role-playing game, originally pulbished in 1997 and now in its fourth edition . . ."" Hmmm, sounds like that date is about twenty years too new.I only wish this was an exception, instead of the rule."
2,Still leaks,"Still leaks, not as much as the none spring type; however it still wastes good beer. I don't recommend this product. I have no issues with the seller, just the product."
4,Better than a gravity valve filler.,Spring closes valve so less messy then the gravity valve fillers.Looses 1 star for the adhesive liable directory applied to it.Was a nuisance removing the adhesive and then removing the adhesive solvent.
4,Egglestomania,"A very nice Eggleston Book, nice color reproductions including some of his early works. What i like most is the size of the book wich makes it an atractive photography book to buy of one of the greatest masters of colour photography."
5,Very Satisfied,"I appreciated the quality of the book I ordered. The seller packaged in cardboard rather than a flimsy envelope, so the paperback spine was not destroyed through shipping. The book looked like it had been read once over, with no markings/highlights. I got this book after shipping for under $10, when it would've cost me $90 to buy it used at the campus bookstore. Deal!"
3,Typical corporate rip-off,"This is so typical of the studios, which continue to rip off the consumers. ""Brenner"" was a series that originally had fifteen episodes during its short 1959 run. Five years later, an additional ten episodes (featuring the same stars) were produced. Now that a series set is coming out, only the first fifteen episodes are included, and the studio is charging thirty bucks. Many of us are disgusted with the way the corporate owners are parceling out series in half season (and less) sets. Is it any wonder that the bootleg DVD market is doing so well?"
2,Terrible dryer,I bought three of these dryers for my salon in October of 2010. All three of them quit working last week. 2 on one day! I like the rheostat controls and have had this dryer in the past with one that has lasted 3 years. The recent quality must be compromised for the new ones to break so soon. I would not recommend this dryer.
3,Bizarre. Ersatz Zappa.,"This is just bizarre...it sounds like a hybrid of Zappa and perhaps some of the orchestral stuff Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus of ABBA wrote, like ""Arrival,"" which whatever I'm listening to now sounds A LOT like.A curiosity."
3,Streaky left side,"Got a black replacement toner cartridge 2 days ago. Hate the high cost of these things, but Amazon's price is better than most and I'm not going to do remanufactured ones. However, even after several prints to 'get things moving', this toner cart is doing intermittent streaking down the left 2-3 inches of the page, sometimes just big areas missing. So, while this is a fine product (albeit overpriced like everything toner/ink related these days), I think I got a bum unit. Going to see what I can do for a swap from Amazon."
5,Just as good as any 100.00 plus cartridge,I have purchase all the colored and black/white toners from amazon from the lowest priced vendors with no issue. Just plug in and goPS. they last just as long as brother cartridges.
5,A must have for any good stereo system,"I've never written a review for any of the many items that I have purchased from [...], but I just had to write a review for this one. All I can say is ""wow!"" I'm not sure why I waited so long to get a good subwoofer for my stereo system. The low-end music reproduction for music AND movies is OUTSTANDING! I am using Monster XP stranded speaker wire, so I can't comment on the sound quality with the speaker wire that came with the unit. Be sure to experiment with different amplification levels and cut-off frequencies (adjustable on the unit)."
5,DEEP ROUND BASS,I own two of these subs in my all SONY HT. I'm more impressed every time I listen to them. The bass is soo deep and round you can feel it in your chest and they are only set to 50% ! If you want kick butt bass the SAWM500 is for you.
3,"Good bass, not so good response.","This sub hits hard, but it leaves me desiring more control in the high bass areas of a movie. I was watching Star Wars III and the scenes in space when a massive ship would come by sounded bad. I do have a high quality monster cable (which greatly improved the sound) but it is still lacking the good sounding bass. The ships flying buy hurt my ears more than pleased. The sub sounds great with explosions, but when there is a constant bass sound, it isn't as clear as I would like.If you are looking for a sub to give you a lot of bang for the buck, this is perfect. I love it, but I know what to look for now when I go to upgrade."
4,Excellent book for first time injuries!!!,"I checked out this book from the library, and after using it for several weeks, decided it would be cheaper to buy the book than pay the library fines. The book provides lots of very useful information on how to manage back pain. Using techniques in the book I was able to recover from a herniated disc much faster than my doctor expected. I gave it 4 of 5 stars only because I found the planning lists at the end of every chapter a bit of overkill. Having fewer lists would have gotten it 5 stars."
1,Nothing compared to the original from 1976!,"As a teenager growing up in the mid 1970's, I use to enjoy going to the theaters and watching those cheaply made teenage exploitation films. The original Hollywood High was funny, showed some brief nudity, and simply brought me back to the days of High school innocence. Hollywood High 2 is nothing more than a waste of time! A teenage exploitation film made in the new millenium simply doesn't work! Don't waste your time with this film! If you want to view good teen exploitation movies, watch The Pom Pom Girls, Van Nuys Blvd, The Van, and the original Hollywood High!"
1,Unless You Have A Brand New Bike...,"Luckily, I got this book from the library before buying it. I own a bike that is about 4 years old (2000 model). This book is dedicated to all brand-new top of the line parts and bikes. When I bought my bike, it was still in the $800-$900 range. Not completely top of the line, but good components. Nothing in this book helped me with the maintenance of them.Bottom line... if you have a brand new bike that has top of the line components, buy this book. If you are like most people who can't afford $2000+ bikes and want to do their own maintenance, buy ""Zinn and The Art of Mountain Bike Maintenance"" by Lennard Zinn. You won't regret it!"
4,An Educational Journey,"""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?"" is an excellent video for parents and grandparents to explore and talk about with children. It will hold the imagination of both young and older children and does justice to the WW II experience. Schulz himself was a veteran of WW II and worked hard at not giving the war a cartoon-ish feel. In fact, the short video might frighten some of the youngest viewers."
4,Amazing Imagination,"Picture a world underground, before coal mining was considered not politically correct. Heck, before anyone even knew what politically correct was! Verne paints a wonderful picture of a life that could be, full of adventure, romance (such as it is in the 1800's), intrigue and mystery.What I enjoyed most were the twists and turns. I expected a different path in the story, but the one the presents might actually be more plausible than the one my brain was trying to go down in guessing what was going on.Very enjoyable."
3,It's No Ryrie Study Bible #2,"I ordered this along with another Scofield study bible because I needed another study bible. I loved my Ryrie and wanted to see if I could do better since some of the doctrine in the notes was off. But, this provides less reference scriptures. And that was critical for me. So, if I had to do it again--I would not order this one. I would order another Ryrie Study Bible."
3,Not Satisfying,"I bought this bible after I made so much visit with different websights to have a full description of the whole product. the descriptions made at the back of the bible as well as other reviews made me decide to have this book. to my dismay, I noticed that only a few notes are made in almost all books of the bible and there were no discussions or notes on controversial passages. I also notice that no other other articles or doctrines were made or appended to the bible which other study bible have.I am dismayed to see it this way despite many comments I read that Scofield Study bible is among the best and authoritative study bibles."
3,Does the job,"These are fairly inexpensive laminating self adhesive laminating sheets. They do what they are supposed to do. It is not possible to reposition your paper after putting it on the sheet, which you can do to some extent with the more expensive Avery brand. But if you are very careful when putting in place what you wish to laminate, these will work fine. They are a bit harder to cut than the Avery sheets too: my scissors got a bit gummy."
2,no any new information,"I do a lot of reading on parenting issues and I didn't find this book useful. There wasn't anything really new that I didn't already know or hadn't read before. I was hoping for specific information on toddler emotional development, such as: when is my toddler emotionally capable of ________ . Instead it was just a general overview of toddlers. A chapter is devoted to shy children or ""slow to warm up"", and really active children. And I guess is you have one and don't know much about those two temperments it may be useful. However I have a ""slow to warm up"" child but again, no new information."
5,Great book!,"I gave this to my daughter and her husband in hopes they would use the tools that are talked about in the book.So far, it has been great for them to validate their daughters feelings. Very important in child raising!"
2,too guilt ridden,"The book had some great information, but the overall take home for me was all the ways I could mess up my daughter for life! Most of the examples were about how Parents A&B; did what they thought was right for their toddler, but accidentally gave the toddler a complex that will impact the rest of her life.I am a good parent who is now double guessing every possible interaction I have with my daugher. My daughter has picked up on my loss of confidence and has become more clingy. UGH. Not worth it!"
3,So boring,"This book seems to have good information, but is very textbookish and boring. I've been trying to read it for 6 months, but keep falling asleep."
5,Enlightening,"This book is amazing. It described BOTH of my children's types accurately. I am seeing them each in a whole new light now. What has struck me is that right away some of the things that used to really irritate me, or worry me, I now find sort of fascinating. Because of Lieberman's insights, I have a MUCH more accurate understanding of my kids and why they do what they do--and what I've been doing to help, or contribute to, the problem.This book has highlighted a few parenting mistakes I've made, too, and given me lots to consider, and the ability to really grow positively as a parent."
4,Toddler Demystified!,I found this book to have great information. Not only answers the what but the why as well.
2,Disappointed in Florida,"The reading was difficult, too technical for the normal lay person. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this book to those who read to ENJOY a book and learn from it. I did order two other toddler books at the same time I bought this one and I am enjoying them thoroughly and have gotten some quite useful information from them."
2,"One-Sided, Hateful Biography","This will be short because much of what I have to say echoes previous reviews. Kenneth Lynn dislikes Chaplin to the the extent that he has written a biography of the man that is patently unfair and one-sided. Lynn is often shameful in attributing hateful and narcissistic motives to as many of Chaplin's career and life decisions as he can. Lynn focuses obsessively on Chaplin's sordid sex life at the expense of his exquisite art. (Lynn doesn't know much about film, it is clear). Lynn writes of Chaplin's political leanings in terms that would make all but red-baiting Joseph McCarthy, the Junior Senator from Wisconsin, blush. Its almost as though through Lynn, McCarthy has returned from the grave. Read this book only if David Robinson's ""Chaplin: His Life and Art"" remains out of print, and then read it skeptically and as a last resort."
2,Chaplin is on trial once again and this time convicted.,"For anyone who has read David Robinson's definitivebiography on Chaplin there is nothing new inKenneth Lynn's ""Charlie Chaplin and his Times,""unless you wish, as the author seems to, that Chaplinwas convicted for all the crimes he was actuallyacquitted of. The author attempts to support hispreposterous thesis that every move Chaplin evermade was either a conscious or subconscious responseto his mother's mental illness. There is nothingabout creative or technical process here, only a 1920'sprudishness and '50's red-baiting mentality. Many ofthe author's interpretations of sexual symbolism inChaplin's early films are truly not for the squeamish."
2,A skewed view of Chaplin and his times,"It is not until late in the book that Lynn's true aim in writing about Chaplin becomes clear. It isnot, as the title implies, an attempt to seat Chaplin's work in the social context of the worldaround him. Instead it is, along with Joyce Milton's ""Tramp,"" another attempt to correctthe left-wing view of Chaplin as an innocent well-meaning artist driven out of America byphilistine witch hunters. Unfortunately, like Milton, Lynn goes much too far in the otherdirection. For instance, he credits such dubious sources as Joan Barry's FBI statement andtestimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee with far more validity thanthey can bear. By the end, it becomes obvious that Lynn has dug into every source that canpresent Chaplin as a politically-hypocritical sexual monster. That he might have been, but Lynn's bias is so obvious that it becomes impossible to get near the truth."
2,Disappointing,"I hung with this book because 'Mr. Lynn' is a highly respected writer. He did not disappoint in that area, the writing is crisp at times but the tone is crabby and vindictive. His obvious dislike for his subject gains as the book progresses. He seems to find it very difficult to compliment Chaplin or any of his films. I think most people when reading a biography hope for a objective approach from the writer but at least in Mr. Lynn's ' Chaplin' you won't find it.."
3,It Could've Been Better,"Yes the songs are great and they are great because we know where they fit in in the movie, BUT what about the suite from Pretty Woman-remember where they kiss for the very first time? Or what about Richard Gere's piano solo he play before making love to Julia Roberts on the piano? How can you be a Pretty Woman fan when you don't even realize the good stuff is missing? And it's the small things like these songs that made that movie so memorable"
5,"Dammi tu forza, o cielo","For anyone who knows latin, you will see that it does not mean Heaven, Give you to me...Dammi tu forza, o cielo= Dame tu fuerza o cielo=Heaven give me your strength!!!But thank god you guys found the name of the song playing at the opera, it is beautiful."
4,Title for Suite ?,Does anyone know the name of the suite from the scene where Gere was looking at a sleeping Roberts ? (after he came out of the bathroom) I've been looking for the title for ages now!
3,Music CD,"Wasn't as good as I was expecting. Some song from movie were missing; some songs, I felt, just didn't belong on the CD."
5,So Beautifully Written!!,"This book hit me where the heart is!!! The characters: Belly, Willie, Miss Janie, Miss Rachel, Mama, Uncle Avery, Miss Pheenie, And of course, the lovely and dearest of all, Miss Ophelia. When I first got into the book,( first quarter of the book),It primarily focused on teen pregnancy and the main character (Belly's) best friend, Teenie getting sent away to get ""rid of her problem"", which hurt Isabel Anderson/Walker.The way the book portrays Miss Opelia, and her warm and kind personality was so well-written, that in the end, I cried, thinking about the True love that could never be, between...Oh!!!!! Youre just going to have to read the book and see why most of these people(including myself, of course) rated this book 5 stars."
2,Wasn't great,"All reels now seem to be made in China, and for the price, this one wasn't smooth at all. I would look for another reel."
5,Classic and timeless masterpieces,"Talk Talk were a large part of my formative years at college in the UK and are an all time favourite. Their melancholic and ethereal compositions were in stark contrast to clubbing to the equally excellent but wholly different ABC, Pigbag and Heaven 17. Often I had (and still have to a certain extent) no idea what the lyrics are but the haunting and plaintive chord structure just tugs at something deep inside. 'Dum Dum Girl' and 'Such a Shame' stand out. This album is a fantastic introduction/nostagia trip to the beauty of Talk Talk and will undoubtedly lead the unsuspecting listener to buying their whole back catalogue. Just don't play it if you're 22, inebriated at a terrible party in Birmingham and you're relationship's just gone pear-shaped!"
3,Half and Half,"Ummm...OK...call me a purist, but I really didn't go for the second-half of this CD and the ""newer"" Talk Talk. I fell in love with the gorgeous synth-pop antics represented in the first six songs of this CD and just couldn't get into tune with their later escapades, although receiving from some people quite a bit of good review. However, I did find the last track, a live version of ""Tomorrow's Started"" to be quite possibly the best track on the CD. After not enjoying too open-heartedly tracks 7-13, ""Tomorrow's Started"" took me by complete surprise. It is definitely a ""OK, I depressed, screw everything, who cares, just let me drive 85 down the highway, while smoking, with both windows down"" kind of song. Very touching.So this CD gets 3 stars..."
3,Not Bad But Should've Had A Different Vocalist.,"Talk Talk produced some average music on this hits package. The first half is pretty good, but the second half of this disc is quite prosaic and plods along except for both versions of ""Life's What You Make It."" Some of the better songs are ""Such a Shame,"" and ""It's My Life."" All in all this is an okay group and hits package, but I think Talk Talk would've fared better with a vocalist with a different style of singing."
3,Plain,"I found this band rather dull and repetitive but I suppose it's worth a spin on a rainy day, for reflection? They do hit the spot once in while with that distinct melancholy 80's sound which I fall for in some cases."
4,Tragically Overlooked,"Talk Talk started out as one of the millions of trendy, new-wave, neo-romantic bands of the time. What they became was so much more but unfortunately only one of thier efforts (The incredible ""Colour of Spring"") was a bonafide classic. It was on that they attained the perfect blend between thier old sound and what was to become thier sound of the future. The best songs on this collection are ""Living in Another World, Life's What You Make It, Give It Up, Hapiness is Easy and Such A Shame"". Thankfully ""Colour"" is represented by four tracks here (It is out of print I beleive, may be available on import). Too bad they took thier sound so far into an ambient mode that by the time of ""Laughing Stock"" you could barely find a pulse."
5,Holds Up Well to even Todays Music!,"I haven't heard some of these songs in countless years and it always amazes me how you can fall right back in love with the songs you grew up listening to just by rediscovering them. Its very RARE for me to love a whole CD without at least not liking a few songs but not with this collection, I totally love all the songs that were chosen!. Awesome songs by a awesome band!."
2,"If you must read, read with a critical eye","I have only read parts of this book; however, it does not surprise me that Professor Quigley is the author.He is hardly an objective observer/academic when it comes to his feelings about the foreign policies of Western Democracies. Throughout his academic career, he has promoted the hardcore pro-Soviet, pro-Third World viewpoint for every topic he has addressed. He is known as a virulently anti-West, anti-Israel, anti-U.S. Gov't academic. I am not saying that his work is automatically disqualified for this reason; any work deserves an independent assessment. However, the facts he presents and conclusions he draws should be read with a critical eye given his past record."
4,The first book I read...,"When I was 12 I picked this book up at my neighbor's yardsale. It was the first real novel I ever read and still ranks as one of the best 5 years later. The story follows a group of Vietnam vet, mercenaries, who's base is taken seige by an ex-Viet Cong commander and his troops. The two forces go to battle, creating a little Vietnam right there. The flashbacks can be kind of irritating, because of their length in the wrong places. They paint a very brutal, real, picture of Vietnam. And while the mercs are more along the lines of Steven Segal mercenaries instead of real world ""military consultants"" the book comes off excellent and would make a great movie."
5,fantastic must have for any architect or otherwise,"Murcutt is final getting his due recognition. this book has it all, and allows one to get an overall sense of his unique career and influences"
1,A slow death,"We followed the directions on this plant, but it had a slow death. People said it would take some time to adapt, so we cared for it but it never seemed to adapt. It finally did die after the Amazon 30 day warranty. Now we are stuck with a dead plant and a pot. We'd love to try a replacment plant if Amazon is up for sending one."
4,I very much enjoyed Tom's of Maine Peppermint ...,"I very much enjoyed Tom's of Maine Peppermint Baking Soda Toothpaste. The product worked wonderfully and had a terrific flavor! In a world where we are taught to embrace major name brands, it was refreshing to know that this is a natural product. I would definitely purchase it again, as I like it better than the brand I was previously using."
3,Tom's of Maine made my teeth feel extra ...,"Tom's of Maine made my teeth feel extra clean and somewhat tingly. The product smelled like peppermint, but the didn't taste like anything besides baking soda. Tom's of Maine is a good toothpaste choice, if you like baking soda in toothpaste."
2,I didn't like this product. It was very ...,"I didn't like this product. It was very bland in taste. Too much baking soda, I think. It didn't freshen my breath for very long and left my teeth feeling gritty. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I think I'll stay with my Crest."
2,I just couldn't get past the taste of ...,"I just couldn't get past the taste of this toothpaste. It basically tasted like baking soda with just a little hint of the mint. I really didn't care for the way it made my teeth feel afterwards either. I'm sure it's because it's all natural, but I think I'll stick with my normal brand."
1,A great attempt but no follow through....,"This is a great attempt at an album. SMZ did everything right, well almost everything.... They took good photos, have a neat website, they made sure to put the product out with a small budget. Unfortunatly it seems as if they forgot about the music. If you crave an orginal synthesized sound, deep lyrics, and an enjoyable ambient groove, look elsewhere."
4,Love it,Support Indie artists. I hope they do well. The album is better than what I thought it was going to be. Sinking the Tide is my favorite.
1,Wouldn't even start up,"The game loaded onto my father's computer without event, but the trouble began with trying to start the game up. When you double clicked on the icon, an error message appeared and the desktop inverted itself. After hours of trying to find ways to rectify this I finally gave up. We downloaded update patches and contacted the seller of the game (who was of very little help to me. Finally answered my question and request for help 2 weeks after I posed it, and at that point I was just fed up). So, we never got to play this game at all since I returned it. Hope you all have more success than we did. I would strongly encourage you to make sure that your system meets all requirements to play this game before purchasing. As it turned out, the seller told me that the manufacturer revised certain requirements for your system beyond what was listed on the website (my guess is because so many people were having trouble with the game)."
2,Could Be Defective...Horrible Customer Service From Distributor,"Used the machine 2 times, on the second time, the bobbin thread will not go through the needle. Called the distributor (thought was manufacturer) No help. CS agent told me the wrong needle was used. How does she know? Was sewing satin material. Simplicity is outside of the country. The distributor in US no longer works with Simplicity. The bottom line is I have to send the machine in (my dime) if they find out that there is a malfunction; I still have to pay $69 for service. And why I asked? Because POLICY states that the machine has to be serviced 1 time per year. Even though I have used the machine only 2 times. Unreal. I would recommend purchasing another brand name from Amazon.com. If I were Amazon, I would not use this distributor. Their customer service does not meet the Amazon.com standards."
4,"Works well, but hard to apply","The dye worked very well for the job I intended it for, but it was missing the dauber. I think that uniformity of the application would have been improved to the point that I only had to apply it once to get even covereage had the dauber been included."
5,Excellent item!,"Works like a charm on wood, as well as on vegetable tan leather. Gives a beautiful dark brown with red undertones."
1,Doesn't work any better than Chocolate Color,"See my other review of this company's products. I can't recommend them. When applied as directed and using their own preparation, I couldn't get this to ""stick"" to furniture leather. It was difficult to apply evenly, and then despite curing it a 2-3 days, it was quickly apparent that the dye was not fast to the furniture, but rubbed off on everything."
1,Ruined my couch,"I bought this to help hide scratches in my leather couch. Despite it being ""dark brown dye"" and my couch being Dark brown/chocolate colored...it BLEACHED the leather of my couch, turning it a very light tan.I did read and follow all directions on the bottle. I shook the bottle to make sure it was well mixed. Unfortunately before I could do the patch test on a hidden area I opened it and spilled two drops on the couch..leaving me with two horrific drip spots. Please see the provided image in the dye's image gallery."
1,"Silly, empty-headed, and pretentious","This is the silliest, most ridiculous book I've ever read, written by a sad, self-loathing gay man, and full of tortured logic and profound bigotry. I am a serious Christian and this book is an insult to Christians everywhere, painting Christianity as nasty, empty-headed, exlusionary biogtry. If this had been written in the 1950s, we could have excused its ignorance and foolishness, but today there is no excuse for it. As a Christian, it embarrasses me, and as a human being, it fills me with pity for its unhappy author. Don't waste your time or money."
1,A Strong Delusion....,".... especially for the poor right wing fundamentalists who will fork over $9.59 of their hard earned money believing that think this book gives them some kind of ""deep"" insight into the issue of homosexuality and the Bible. Wrong. Like every other fundamentalist book on the subject, it's deeply misguided.Save your money.. tithe it instead... maybe to a local AIDS hospice (which would be THE Christian thing to do). Joe Dallas is not only clueless, he's delusional. IMHO, he was closer to the Living God in the MCC than he is now."
1,Unscholarly work,"This title by Mr. Dallas is yet another example of his lack of theological though (or training), his lack of scholarly training in exgesis, and his lack of love for all of God's people. As a biblical language scholar and a theologian I find nothing redeeming and nothing of truth in this title nor any title by Mr. Dallas."
1,Hateful and self-deluded,This is a hateful and ridiculous book whose only serious audience can be bigots.
4,It is refreshing to read the truth about this issue,Joe Dallas does a great job of dispelling the myths propagated by pro-gay Christians. The truth is the only thing that will set people free. The Christian pro-gay agenda is a contrived lie that is destroying souls. The misuse of data to substantiate homosexuality is frightening.Joe's love and concern for the souls of homosexuals is what makes this good book a great book. It takes courage to follow Christ. We can't make up the rules as we go along.Joe Dallas is a good author. He will make a good Catholic someday.
1,nonsense,book such as these continue the myth that homosexuality is wrong - it is sad to think some people still believe this nonsense.
1,Loudness war casualty,"This recording was not given the respect it deserves for the 2009 remaster. Go to 3:21 of the first track. Just after ""Rox you like a baby"" where the music kicks back in, you'll find some obvious distortion. You won't find the same distortion on the original 1991 release of the album, nor on the 2003 remaster of the single version found on both The Pop Hits and The Rox Box. It's a shame, the sonic equivalent of brightening up a picture in Photoshop to the point of blowing out the highlight details. I'm happy I went to see them in Taipei this year and that I bought only the tour program instead of the remastered CDs."
5,One of the best albums I've ever owned...,"Normally, I don't particularly like pop music, but this album is a masterpiece. I first bought this album in high school after a girlfriend showed it to me, and like so many others, simple wore the tape out. I can't think of another album where EVERY song is great... and this is coming from a guy that was into metal at the time.I've probably listened to Fading Like a Flower several hundred times since 1991, and I'm still not tired of it. The melodies stick with you and you can't help humming them to yourself later on.I only wish Roxette would have continued their style of Joyride... but no such luck. The other albums are alright, but nothing compared to this.If you're taking a roadtrip, or just need some beautifully written music to listen to, by this CD before it's out of production- you won't be sorry."
5,Wonderful Ride!,"I got this on a cassette when i was about 12years old. Played it so many times tat it was worn off! Now I got it on CD it's gonna last a lifetime. It's the most amazing album i ever had. If you havn't got your copy, get it NOW!"
5,joyride LIVE nothing better,"I hear the songs and they take me back to the early 90's. excelent music, LIVE is best"

4,'Amberdelic Space' (Riviere International Records) Various Artists 4-CD Box Set,"Every bit as good as it's follow-up 'Amberdelic Space II: Angel Of Ecstasy' (see my review). Total of forty-four tracks on this collection of pure ambient, electronic, techno and dub artists. With this piece, I'm definitely hearing tunes from more artists that I'm not only familiar with but I know I have at least one CD of theirs - like The Orb, Deep Space Network, Astralasia, Porcupine Tree, Future Sound Of London, Jupiterhead, System 7, Another Green World and Magic Mushroom Band. Noticed that this piece is much higher priced than 'Amberdelic Space II: Angel Of Ecstasy' for some reason(s). Didn't Dressed To Kill release this title as well?"
5,Stopped weep hole leak,I noticed the system started leaking a lot of water through the weep hole. I changed the membrane and filters and the system works great with no more leaks. Very satisfied.
2,Reverse Osmosis Membrane Cartridge,"unfortunately after applying this product to my filter system, the system now has a very loud moaning sound and the water is not filtering through at the expected speed, so hard to say if it's the system itself or the new membrane cartridge. at this point have to buy a whole new system, before continuing to buy more cartridges. there doesn't seem to be a warranty on this product. since I didn't buy it through GE and too expensive to try again. thank you!"
4,Worth Getting,"I love Mindy McCready so if she were singing the phone book, I'd buy it. However, that said, even with her incredible voice, my opinion is the songs on this particular CD are not as good as on some of her others."
1,"an old plot retold, not very well, about traitors, misfits.","Looking at the reviews, I thought someone had splipped me a mickey! This story is an atempt to put a British spin on story about a few misguided, mangy, want-ta-be American Rambos and a couple derranged, misbegotten Brits. Perhaps, the story wouldn't have been so bad if the the author had understood some things about American slang. He kept getting mixed up on who was who. Americans do not ever say ""bloody"" and we are never ""bloks"". The ending has been heard, or read, or seen, on the ""box"" hundreds of times. It amazes me how we can pretty much look like 'em (the Brits), but be so damn different from them. Don't bother reading this one!"
3,Campfires and Game Trails: Hunting North American Big Game,"Good book by a great author. Info is now dated of course, but well written."
5,Great CD for the money,lots of songs including a few great live tracks that showcase how great his band really was. Nearly every song swing hard as hell but you can also get an example of the interplay between Louis and Keely Smith during a live show that is great fun to listen to and image your in Vegas during the mob years.
4,Louis Prima Capitol Collectors Series,"The CD is of great quality and arrived ahead of schedule. Having heard many Louis Prima songs before ever owning an album, I thought all of his songs would be perfect and golden. Well, in the Capitol Collectors Series there are a couple of weird filler songs but overall the songs are enjoyable. I was even pleasantly surprised toward the end of the album, when I discovered fine quality jazz tracks.Overall I am glad to own some of Louis Primas greatest hits and I don't regret a thing. However, with how weird a couple of songs are I probably won't seek to own everything Prima's made."
5,Great Album,Fabulous album with all Louie Prima's best. The man was ahead of his time. Have listened to this album at least 2-3 times per week.
5,Grooving,I really Dug what Louis Prima did on this set.The Music has alot of flavor&never lets up at all.Alot of Fun Here&very upbeat music.A Must Have.
1,Extraordinary music on a very bad CD,"There is no other as talented and timeless as Luis Prima, and this is an amazing collection. However, the CD only plays some of the time and in some CD players...it never does. It is very frustrating! Why bother buying this if you can't enjoy it?"
2,Mediocre,"I love Louis Prima, but this CD was disappointing. It arrived in the mail, and I put it in the stereo. The first song is ""Just aGigolo"". It's a classic. Unfortunately, half of this CD sounds like ""Just a Gigolo"" - the same beat, the same arrangements, and in one case, the identical vocal line. Every song on this CD seems to have the same rhythm which is very annoying. I wouldn't recommend this particular album."
5,"If your feeling low, this will sure perk you up!","This album was more then what I thought it would be. While listening to this album, you can't stop yourself from wanting to get up and dance. If your not in the mood, this album will pick you up and put you there. If your Italian, you will love it (check out the cut called ""Angelina-zooma zomma"")as it brings back memories of the good old days with the family. Buy it, you'll like it."
5,"Too cool, great sound, I can't stop listening!","Brian Setzer has nothin on Louis Prima. This group can swing! Sam Butera's sax style and tone is refreshing, big sound and he can sing. Really makes you want to have been around to see them play live, this must have been a great show in Vegas."
5,Shwank collection of one of the best!,"Yeah, yeah, I know that everyone knows ""Jump, Jive An' Wail"" from the Gap commerical but it annoys me that some people think that Brian Setzer Orchestra did it first. Prima did it first and (IMHO) better and I'm happy that he's finally getting some attention!I first heard Prima from old records I found at the library and this CD is the perfect place for a fan to start his/her collection. Unfortunately, most of the stuff isn't written by Prima, but he does breathe a lot of life into the covers he does.Most of the stuff is very danceable (I know, 'cause I *love* to swing dance!) and the horns are fabulous, as is the wonderful voice of Keely Smith on some of the duets.There's a lot of Prima's history included in the liner notes for those interested. Worth every penny. :)"
5,so much fun,Louie Prima was a true original. He's been copied but no one has quite matched this level of joyous lunacy. Buy this and have a blast. And catch his wife Keely in concert if you have a chance.
4,Great buy,"This album is a DEAL. Twenty-six songs cheap! I got it at ... for $... . They all swing, and there are ballads in there as well that are great. The 'Embraceable You' track is hilarious. I bought it mainly for the 'Angelina, Zooma Zoom' medley, but as a whole this is probably the best Prima collection available. His version of 'St. Louis Woman' is cranked up. All of these tunes were recorded in the late 50s, when Louis Prima was at the top of his game. His mixtures of style, sudden tempo changes and craziness always keeps you on your toes. He let his horn section do lots of solos; some of the saxaphone work is some of the best I've heard for swing."
5,Great CD!!,"Love this CD!! Never heard of Louis Prima before but a friend brought one to work...and after listening to it ""in the office, in the car, at home""....I have to get one for myself!! Can't get enough of this!! Keely is incredible, Louis is fun, fun, fun!!"
5,It's a broom!,"This is a nice broom. Perfect length. Common it's a broom! The bristles are nice and can gather everything. I still need to pick up a mop, though :)"
5,A Dog and People Pleaser,"Our small (15-lb) dog really likes these beef-flavored bones, and we like them too--because they help clean her teeth and they don't leave sticky residue on our carpets and furniture or leave stains on her white whiskers. It's a win all around!"
4,bones,"They were good, thought they were a bit on the brittle side, overall the puppy loved them. I would buy them again if they were on sale or special."
2,good lens,"i only recieved the 70-300 lens i ordered two kits only got the 70-300 called numerious times kept saying it will ship after a month of run around i filed a claim against cameta camera, the said it was back ordered and they will ship it out when it comes in 2 years later i still do not have the 28-80 lenses.the 70-300 is a great lens clear and durable, verry happy with this lens, two years and over 7,000 images will buy other tamron products just not from cameta camera"
2,Get what you pay for.,"It was my way of testing the waters for a smaller price and I wished I would have just bought the Canon EF 28mm-135mm lens and got it over with. The Tamron 70mm-300mm broke and quit telescoping on the first day of use. I'm trying to work with Tamron to get this fixed. The photos I did take were extremely blurry. The 28mm-80mm lens works fine, but the autofocus is a little slow compared to the canon lens for my Rebel XTI. I would stick with the Canon lenses."
5,"""Must Have"" book for any IT professional dealing with IMS",This is the most complete reference book for IMS I have ever seen.
4,highly realistic legal world,"This may be one of the most realistic books about a lawyer I have encountered.Once in awhile, you can do something good. In this case, Tubby can get a young man out of jail on a habeas corpus petition.His most lucrative client is pretty evil - again just like real life.Mostly he can make accommodations and somehow arrive at more or less satisfactory results. Usually nobody gets 100%.Just like real life.The dialog is excellent - reminds me of the Spencer novels [major kudos].The plot is good enough to keep me interested and the story flows along at a good pace.High recommendation"
4,Fun,"This is a fun book. A nice ""quick read"" that is well worth the time and money. I will read more from the author!"
2,NOT A MUST READ,PASS ON THIS ONE. DIDN'T HOLD MY INTEREST. LOVE FREE BOOKS BUT DON' READ THE ONES THAT JUST DON' MEASURE UP.
1,0 stars - Pure trash. Just dumb music.,"How garbage like this gets on the radio I will never know. This hack has absolutly no talent or writing skills......this sucks. The ""hold my beer"" song is probally one of the worst pieces of crap I have ever had the displeasure of hearing, it's just dumb. I guess the song called ""I kissed a guys girlfriend in a bar asked him to hold my beer and he wasted me"" is going to be on the next album. From what I can see, anyone calling this an amazing album or the best album ever either:1.Never listened to any good music before2.Can't read lyrics3.Don't appreacheate talent4.Have crap taste is music.....this album is an insult to music and should never have been produced. Hopefully Arron Pritchett got killed for trying to kiss some guys girlfriend and we don't have the displeasure of listen to this trash again."
1,Bug Infested,I'm always hesitant to write a negative review because tastes are different but with this product I felt I had a duty to alert consumers. I bought this and out of the box it was pretty until I looked close and found it was infested with tiny white bugs that clung to nearly every branch and leaf. I hoped they would die on their own but after three weeks they were still there and the plant itself had started to die. I bought plant insect spray and they killed the bugs. The plant died two weeks later. I was very disappointed since I'd always wanted a bonsai tree and gardenia is my favorite scent.
1,Broken pot,"Not sure if the plant is going to survive, The pot was broken when we opened the box yet the shipping box showed no signs of damage. I can't find out how to return it either since it is a plant - these independent Amazon merchants make returns difficult : ( So much for this present."
2,Doesn't look like a bonsai tree at all,"Positive: Gardenia Bonsai arrived in good shape and packaged well.Negative: Did not look like a Bonsai at all, they advertise they are suppose to be 4 yrs old?? Mine looked like a normal Gardenia bush that was pruned way back and stuck in a small pot. I plan on returning it, my wife was disappointed because it was a christmas gift for her!"
4,Great Bonsai Plant,I received this as a gift and think it is a wonderful plant. Much better than cut flowers that will die off in a week. My bonsai arrived in really good condition with no broken branches and green leaves. It doesnt have any flowers or buds but I am hoping with a little love and care it may eventually get some Gardenias.
1,came complete or did it?,This gardenia tree looked so cute online and we love gardenias. It arrived with a note to hurry and purchase a tray to go under the pretty pot which has 2 draining holes. It was a surprise this was not included. The plant did however come complete with ectoparasites (something like green scales clinging to the branches) and white flies. It was also not as mature as shown in photo - more like 3 branches with scant green and yellow leaves.
2,Not thrilled,"Not too thrilled with this one though. Seems to not have any growth and getting yellower by the day. I'm not sure it survived shipping very well. It was moist when we got it, but there was only one bloom left on it which dropped after one week. I didn't care for it any differently than the Jade, which sits right next to it on the counter. The only thing it seems to attract is bugs. We finally had to put it outside because it was getting pretty bad. I think its still alive, but not sure how much longer it has."
4,"Good packaging, nice plant","I'm skeptical of the ""helpful"" reviews here with such low marks. I purchased this plant as a Mother's Day gift and my mom has had nothing but success with it. They aren't supposed to flower for a year or two after you get them (due to the adjustments they need to the climate and your particular (bad?) watering habits), but she got the plant to flower twice in one year. I think a key to this was keeping it outside during our nice, sunny Minnesota days, and then bringing it inside again each and every night. Adding the correct fertilizer in the correct amount is important.Bonsai aren't necessarily easy, but this one has done well. That's my experience anyway.Also, I was impressed with the packaging - securely shipped and eco-friendly. And the flowers smell absolutely wonderful!"
2,What was this?,"So it came with beautiful greens and full of flowers. Was really optimistic, no instructions - i.e. how old is it? After the flowers died, it got fleas, which are soil related. It bugged my other plants. However, its a cutting of a shrub, not a bonsai. Its just stuck in a bonsai pot. Now I'm in the bug spraying mode- frustrating. It would have been easier to care for it as a plant, since its buggy. Now I have to train it into a bonsai. It seems root bound, but we're not supposed to anything the first year. Gardenias are hardy but delicate so I'm frustrated with spraying for bugs and for the season I have to bring it in and I hate bugs."
3,Pulp fiction? Yeah...,"1960's white male fantasy. Lovely women, hot grease covered chunks of meat, huge broadsword, a half-naked warrior, battles, blood, EVIL! You get the picture. A book full of short stories - Brak was tossed out of his homeland for making fun of their Gods. Now him and his huge sword roam south, towards paradise called Khurdisan. How do you even SAY that? He gets in trouble with an Evil God that sounds like something out of Lovecraft and spends most of his time saving people and doing good.A good story if you do not wish to think and want second-rate fantasy by a author who loved Conan, The Mouser and Fafhrd, and Cugel - whoever that is."
3,A Little Too Small...,"Nobody else's fault but my own; I hate how small it is. It's good quality, but I didn't read the size and now I'm stuck with a really small Prison Break poster. Keep that in mind- also, there's a white trim around the edges so the poster is actually smaller than 11"" by 17""."
5,Perfect gift (especially for yourself),"I'm a giver of books: novels, poetry, cookbooks, and more than any other single book, this one: ""Bridging."" It has art and love, form and metaphor. The beautiful images and the metaphor of ""bridging"" -- and the personality of the recipient and the occasion for the gift -- make inscribing the book for a friend a pleasure.I grew up with the Mississippi bridges of St. Louis and have lived for decades with the bridges of New York City -- so I feel that the photographer is a kindred spirit and made this book for me. Cortright awakens the eye and mind to the beauty of bridges -- from all angles and in all weathers. These are not promotional postcards, but lovingly composed and arranged photographs that give us not only the settings but the personalities of these bridges.See the Civil Engineering review below for a fine appreciation of bridge builders' and Cortright's achievements -- technically and aesthetically. Better yet, take a look at the book."
3,I would not reorder this...,"I searched high and low for a bank that would wrap coins such as this one. This appeared to be a reasonable choice, but is one that I would not make again.The bank seemed to take a long time to arrive, and arrived cracked, with a piece broken off. It is made of a rather thin plastic, which might survive use, but not shipping in the flimsy packaging they supply. My kid was delighted though, and would not surrender it for me to exchange it for a (hopefully) undamaged one. He has used the bank several times, and it appears to work okay, although he has been careful not to overload it and to only send a few coins at a time, as other reviewers have suggested.So, it is very flimsy, works okay, has a good chance of arriving damaged, and all said, I would look elsewhere in the future. I have had a similar item in the past, which was much better made and it worked for years."
3,My Real Opinion on Real World Boston/Seattle video,"This video documents both casts -- but it's more-so focused on boston. Im a fan of the seattle cast and thought there'd be more scenes from that season, unfortunatly not. It made me laugh. Good clips from seattle...if u're interested in buying the video, i recommend buying it here, i paid more @ the mall..this is a deal. It's worth it. Keep it real. D. from WI END"
3,Real World Boston-Seattle,"This movie was pretty good and I found oout some good info on the cast members. I am Really just a fan of The Seattle season, this movie is mostly the Boston Cast. It is worth Checking out though! END"
3,This should be called Boston you've never seen (kinda),"This video was okay. I am an avid RW fan and I've seen every singles episode since the OG New York cast. Personally the Boston series was not one of my favorites, Seattle on the other hand was one of the best in my opinion. This video should be called Boston you've never seen because everything was about the Boston cast, the only real thing they showed or said about Seattle was how bad David smelled. If it had shown more of Seattle I would have enjoyed this video, however I was all about Boston, mainly focusing on Genisis,Kamila and Jason. In my opinion you should either rent this one or borrow it from a friend, its not that great. If you want my opinion you should buy the RW New Orleans, THAT ONE IS HILLARIOUS!!!"
5,amazing... especially if you feel like it,"if you feel like hell, after being rejected/dumped, etc. this is album is the perfect companion. FS's renditions of ""A Cottage For Sale"" and the little-known ""This Was My Love"" are the two saddest songs I have ever heard.I strongly believe that for evry emotion or experience or love-related situation you can be in, there is a Sinatra song that could explain your feelings perfectly. At this time, mine is ""I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You."" Listen to it, you'll know how I feel.I love Gordon Jenkins' arrangements. NO song do they fit better than ""Stormy Weather."" The deep, lush strings really create the sensation of dark, depressing rainclouds.In summary, everything including the cover art (my favorite picture) works. Buy if you're lonely, depressed, or just want something soothing to sleep to."
5,The Ultimate in Lyrical Intepretation,"Superior to ""Where Are You"" (better songs overall) & more depressing than ""Only The Lonely"". One of Frank's great masterworks when ""The Voice"" was unmatched in this solar system. To Frank the lyric was EVERYTHING, the melody just supported it. This CD is NOT recommended for anyoune on the emotional edge.You will jump! This CD is the BEST of its kind!!!"
1,Disappointing arrangements,"I purchased the CD because I wanted one of my favorites HERE'S THAT RAINY DAY, but am very disappointed - Sinatra's voice is strong but the orchestra and musical arrangements are very weak!"
5,Sinatra at his best--brings new meaning to crooning,"His choice of selections, coupled with the innovative and lush arrangements of Gorden Jenkins, make this one of the less well-known but absolutely essential albums to have in your Sinatra collection. Listen to ""A Cottage for Sale,"" for example. It is clearly the most stirring rendition recorded--you won't be disappointed!"
5,Excellent! Worth every penny.,The compilation of these songs is the perfect showcase for Sinatra's smooth and sultry voice. The music is a complimentary backdrop to his singing style. My absolute favorite Frank Sinatra recording.
5,Frankie,Who can not love Frankie??!! This is on my Kindle so I can listen often. It is full of sad song which really can cher one up.
3,Ponderous stuff,"I am writing this to add a dissenting voice to these high praise proceedings. ""No One Cares"" is my least favorite of the classic 50s Capitol lps Sinatra recorded. Blame the ponderously slow pace, the pretentious Jenkins arrangements and Sinatra's quavery, somewhat strained delivery of these tunes. There is a lack of humor and bounce here, two qualities Sinatra normally had plenty of (""Can't Get Started"" in particular comes off stilted) and compared to another torchy record -- ""Wee Small Hours"" -- ""No One Cares"" feels dreary. Nelson Riddle managed to bring swingier, more bouyant elements to ""Wee Smalls"" set of love songs, while keeping the tempo slow. It is still Sinatra, and still worth hearing, but in my opinion this collection sounds dated, something that cannot be said for most of the other Capitol albums."
3,a light weight very bland and boring comedy,"a quite regular movie, quite cliched screeplay and storyline. the problem of this movie is that you could see every turn's coming and know what's next. maybe a few half-hearted laughs and that' all, folks"
1,No fun,NO fun at all. She has not ever had an orgasm and when her husband leaves her she starts to look around...
3,Oh no....,"""The Oh in Ohio"" had a lot of the ingredients to make it a successful film but it didn't quite do it for me. I enjoy the premise of the film as it centers on the Priscilla's sexual awakening. I enjoy Paul Rudd's performance. He is always likable. I commend the film for pairing an unlikely couple together, even though it is not within the norms of Hollywood. However, I found the film to be oddly hollow. While I appreciated the trajectory and character arc of Priscilla and Jack, I also found it difficult to pinpoint the point of the story. Priscilla's narrative felt confident. It knew where it wanted to go. However, Paul Rudd's storyline seems muddied. I wasn't sure how his narrative fit into the grand scheme of the movie. The ending seemed abrupt and unconvincing. It left us a void that the movie should have filled. That said, it is still an enjoyable film. Paul Rudd and Parker Posey are great enough actors to keep us captivated, even if the story doesn't do them justice."
4,"Very good, worth the watch - Great cast!","The Oh in Ohio is a witty comedy about the complexities of an orgasm.Paul Rudd plays the quick wit slacker character that we've grownaccustomed to seeing and Parker is the adorable know it all that we alllove. The film is surprisingly funny and heart warming. Danny Devitoplays an endearing lovable salesman. This film manages to take theromantic comedy genre viewer into different, unexpected directions. I'ma big fan of filmmakers that can take a date or couples film genre,like a romantic comedy, and turn the genre into a film for all to enjoy. Ifyou're a Paul Rudd fan than this is surely a role of his that you don'twant to miss. This film is worth a watch if you like to laugh you wontbe disappointed!"
1,The OH in Ohio,I thought that this film was a complete waste of time. I didn't like the lead female character. I thought the ending was horrible and the only reason I watched it was because typically Paul Rudd
4,Heads Up,"I for one truly enjoyed this game, unfortunately i rented it from gamefly only recently.The add-on, Ambition of the Iluminus is no longer available from the marketplace, and onlineplay has been discontinued for those who do not possess AOTI.With a brand new Phantasy Star online in the future in 2013, All servers for PSU will close downthis November, or have already done so.I recommend this game for those who do not care about online play.But 35 dollars for the xbox title is a tad too much."
1,YUCK,"if you liked phantasy star online it doesn't mean you will like this, everything sucks and is more complicated where it shouldn't be and less where it was, the graphics are worse too, nothing worthwhile that is new really, online action does NOT improve the game as much as on PSO, if you played PSO this is a 1 star game compared to it, if you didn't this is a 3 star game."
2,... well,"Phantasy star universe is truly a amazing universe but there are some MAJOR flaws in this game. One of these that is truly annoying is that there are chapters in this game. What i mean by chapters is that at the end of a level it ends like a cartoon show and gives you a preview of the next one. Also the single most horrible flaw with this game is that you HAVE TO PAY FOR ONLINE!!!!!! If you have this for the xbox 360 you already pay for your online capabilities but these guys want you to pay more and its ALOT more. Its 10 dollars more to get on and get insulted constantly by a bunch of nerds! If you want to play online in this game get the demo for it because it is free. If this game didn't have horrible voice acting, chapter endings and previews, loading screens that constantly pop up, and a online fee it could have been a great game. I would recomend renting it for a weekend to get the achievements from it which are WAY too easy and then returning it and forgetting you ever played it."
1,Phantasy Star Universe review,The game just sucks. Costs ten bucks a month to play. Looks like a ps2 game rather than a 360 game.
3,Forerunner to today's horror,"While lacking the spookiness of his other work, The Five Jars is a good M.R. James story. It concerns a man who finds a magic plant, then a magic box, and then magic jars that allow him to see the other world of fairies, gnomes, and such. The jars are desired by those who should not have them. Part of the story lies in James' use of animal discussion and part in the fact that he doesn't feel the need to explain everything."
2,Comic Sans? What?,"Before I touch on anything else I'd like to state, up front, that if I had known the book was printed in Comic Sans I would not have bought it at any price. This is not a joke; the horrible font is a major distraction from the story. It was hard to believe my eyes, frankly. It may have been a full minute before I was able to actually accept the information they were trying to feed my protesting brain. Even now I find myself opening the book with the expectation that I have been mistaken, and the font is back to normal--no.The illustrations are faded, 3rd-generation copies of low-resolution scans of the originals. They are, for instance, so poorly rendered as to obscure the words written on the scrolling ribbon across the jars on the frontispiece.At $25, I feel taken advantage of by the publisher for the level of quality in printing and typography. None of the choices they've made are understandable and the result is a damned shame."
4,It works; and it's not hard to install,"Purchased this after a long search and many visits to Car Toys and other auto accessory stores. The product took me only 90 minutes to install; most of this time was spent pulling out the stereo head unit (an HU-605 in my 2006 Volvo S80).It works very well with the IPod; the only complaints:1) Sometimes when you start the car; the system skips around and the stereo displays ""CD Changer Load Discs"". It takes about 5 seconds and then it works fine.2) If you try and quickly change the ""CD"" (which changes the playlist) the unit can become confused, and it takes a few seconds to recover its mind.Other than that, it works well and I'm happily listening to my ipod; and my sirius radio through the AUX input on the unit."
1,Mediocre audio quality,"I purchased this looking for a connectivity solution for my iPod and my 2001 V70. The audio quality is passable at best. The filter does not do a good job at eliminating electrical interference and there is a clear static hiss while the unit is charging.I contacted them and they said there was a problem with some of their filters, they provided me with a new one and the results were only slightly better.My previous setup using the same iPod used an audio cassette adapter and the iPod's headphone jack. The quality was crystal clear. I'd rate the clarity of this just barely above a FM modulator.Overpriced for the quality of sound you get out of it."
1,Beware Authorized dealers,"I bought a unit from AudioKraze via amazon and when I connected to my Volvo head unit, it doesn't recognize three different ipods I tried.I called USASPEC and they said that AudioKraze is not an authorized dealer so they couldn't warranty the unit.so, don't buyer beware if buying USASpec from Audio Kraze"
5,USA SPEC PA11-VOL,Works well as described. The installation was easy and straightforward. No bad surprise or unexpected difficulties were encountered by simply following the instructions and diagrams.USA SPEC PA11-HON - iPod in-vehicle interface adapter
4,really enjoying this,"I had the product installed in my Volvo a few days ago. I'm really happy with it -- great having access to my I-Phone while I drive. It works nicely via my steering wheel controls, except the fast forward, when I'm listening to Pandora, moves my I-Phone away from Pandora to my I-Pod library. I can deal with that. Sound quality seems to be quite good. Great having it recharge as I drive.My only concern about this product is regarding installation. Happily I have car expert neighbor who was able to do a professional quality installation in about two hours. I'm reasonably handy but could not have done it myself. The instructions were pretty clear, but disassembling the console is no small endeavor."
5,Great product!! DOSE work on 1999 volvo S80!!!,pretty simple to install. it only took about 20min to do. Sound quality it perfect. And Dose work on my 1999 volvo S80 2.9. The description and the manufacture said it wouldn't work on a 99 but i found out it dose!!!! :) :)
4,ipod for volvo s80,Product works as advertised. Had it installed at an car audio shop for $90. Sounds awesome. Easy to use. Would recommend it. Plan to get one for my Explorer.
4,"works fine, and don't expect everything","Works as described in the descriptions:- compatible with HU850 audio systems in Volvos (S60, MY 2007)- can play from AUX source (any 3,5"" jack) and iPod/iPhone (also charging the device)- can handle up to 4 playlists- controls iPod from steering wheel (volume up/down, track fwd, rwd)Neither folders, nor song titles though...Installation is relatively straight forward, you only need the know-how to disassemble the dashboard.... wiring is not an issue..."
4,GOOD CD,Damn How We roll was my jam back in tha day. This cd has some good songs. I would recommend this cd to my friends
5,THE best book on KM,This is THE best book on KM-one that started the field. Make sure you read this one if you have any interest in knowledge management.
2,This is not a book and it's free online anyway,"The only thing you need to know about this ""book"" is that it's not a book at all, but an article that is available for free online as a 10 page PDF file. Google the title and save yourself the $8.95 plus shipping that I spent to find that what was shipped to me I already had on my hard drive. The ""book"" is 56 pages double spaces and the size of a small birthday card. As to the concepts discussed, I find them highly interesting but in fairness I'm still investigating this subject so I'll leave the analysis to others better qualified but the central theme that knowledge is tacit and created in Japanese firms vs. quantifiable, objective and structured in IT systems in the western world is worthy of consideration. Two stars for this idea having value for anyone looking to re-create the organizational knowledge structure of a company, but I'm being generous. It feels like I got ripped off."
4,Harlem Summer,"I found a paperback copy of *Harlem Summer* in a used bookstore, and purchased it on a whim (having lived on the edge of Harlem for several years, I wondered if the book would mention landmarks or spots that I knew). This turned out to be a very compelling, well-written book with excellent characterisations. My favourite character is Old Paul, Mark Two's Grandfather. But really, all the characters were well drawn, believable, and multi-faceted, even the ""villains"", Dippy and Duke. The novel also works in relevant historical information, concerning the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Marcus Garvey's life and times, etc. Though I found it in the ""young adult"" section, as an adult I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,First time buyer great experience,"I have only purchased from eBay once before and I was actually close enough to the seller to travel to the location to check out the item in person. Therefore, I was ordering this item on faith and was pleased when it was exactly like the item I was replacing.The picture of the item was great."
1,Mashed Potatoes and Country Gravy with Turkey == Mystery Mounds,"Prepping for the assault on Mount Robson in Robson River Campground, we opted to give Alpine Aire's Mashed Potatoes and Country Gravy with Turkey a try. Oops--we don't pack a pot large enough for the required 3.25 cups of boiled H2O. We found an O2 absorber and a country gravy packet inside. The directions didn't address the gravy packet. So we boiled 2 cups and mixed 'em with gravy and then into the main package while boiling another 1.25 cups. The water mixed poorly. We waited 8 minutes after each addition of hot water and still the moderately chunky turkey wasn't fully rehydrated, although the bits had a turkey flavor. The overall result was poor quality instant potatoes that were too runny and flavorless even with added salt and pepper. We threw half away and ate crackers instead."
3,Expensive way to buy rice,"I am not overly impressed paying so much for a package loaded with low cost ingredients available at the market: rice, dried potatoes, pasta but little of the protein ingredients that are not readily available. I sampled several packages of freeze-dried dinners and found rice, rice, and more rice.For short hikes of a few days I take pasta or potatoes, dried cheddar cheese, or cheese and noodles packaged together. A tour through a supermarket will reveal many dry ingredients that are nutritions and tasty. Take the tour and buy what you find - you will save a ton of money and enjoy eating at a fraction of the cost.Trail Mix, dried fruit, Jello, sugar cubes and tea or coffee. Beef jerky, the list goes on and on.Now if they would just make us some freeze-dried beer to enjoy after a hot climb..."
4,AlpineAire Freeze Dried Stroganoff,I prefer fresh foods when car camping. Living in the gulf coast we are gathering freeze dried foods for our disaster plan. AlpinAire offers packaged food with lower sodium levels than the other long term foods. These package dates are good into 2014. I regard four-year storage as a minimum.The stroganoff was served on toast from jalepeno bread. It was really good over the jalepeno toast; perhaps just OK by itself.I plan to buy lots more AlpineAire freeze dried packages before hurricane season in June but the selection options on Amazon are limited.
1,Worst ever,I like their products but this is their worst ever. They either need to design the product better with an extra bag to cook the gravy or take the product off the shelf. Couldn't get all of the mash to mix and if you don't have an air tight container to cook the gravey in it does not fully cook. Don't buy it unless they make changes!
5,Cool for the dogs in motorhome,This is a must for motorhomes during the summer!!! Our soft coated wheaton terriers can benefit from the cabs air conditioner. This small fan really moves the air around and circulates the cool air. It stays pretty stable and is so easy to use. We use it outside when camping to move the air so the bugs don't bother you. We love this fan.
2,IT'S OK,"My fan will not work on high, so not sure what the problem is, power source? anyway I do like the fact that's it's made in the USA and it does blow a lot of air on low.It could be a good fan depending on your use.I purchased it for tent camping (8 man Tent) and unless you need hearing aids, this fan is noisy, so much so that we would not be able to sleep with it on.To bad, it could be a great fan if the noise level could be lower, but than the trade off would be NO AIR.Like I said depending on your use, it could be a very good fan for you. Noise is my only issue. Good luck.Anyway, I am happy with Amazon."
5,Great fan for RV use,"We use this fan for camping in our small motorhome. We do not have a generator, so when we aren't able to hook up to electicity, we use this fan for cooling purposes. It performed great for our summer vacation to the Virginia mountains and Maryland coast. Temps were in the high 90's and we wouldn't have made it without this fan!"
5,Great little fan,"Keeping a houseboat cool on hot summer days can be a challenge. Rather than run the air conditioner and burn up gas (which isn't cheap these days), we wanted a good fan that would really move the air. This fan surprised even my extremely skeptical husband as it moves a great deal of air on all three speeds. In fact, we are so impressed with the Endless Breeze, we have another one on the way."
4,12 volt fan,"I bought this Endless Breeze 12 fan to use in constructing a swamp cooler. I live in an off-grid, 12 volt DC house. It runs quiet on the first two speeds. Little noisey on the highest speed, but that's to be expected. Draws very little current for the amount of work it does."
3,expensive,Made very cheaply but it fills a nich -12 volt radiator fans cost about the same if you were making one yourself. I dont see the feet/hangers lasting long being held in with a single screw.
5,It did what I hoped it would,"I have two dogs who travel with me. I bought this fan knowing there was going to be a day I was going to have to park the dogs in my travel trailer in possible heat and with no electricity for air conditioning. I tested it ahead of time, several days prior to my trip. It kept things amazingly comfortable and drew very little from my solar charged battery. On several occasions on the same trip I had to leave the dogs in the car, once for three hours. Of course, I parked in shade and opened windows, but this fan did the job. Very pleased with it."
5,this fan blows,"This is the greatest 12v fan you will ever buy. Dont waste your money on the ""tent fans"" or ""personal fans"", get this one. This is the 5th fan i have tried for camping. This will be the last fan I buy for a long time. It has it all, except the cord is rather short."
4,Great fan,"This is my second Endless Breeze fan. The first one was so noisy it had to be sent back, but Amazon took care of everything and sent me a second one. The fan is VERY efficient, however, if you have this fan in the bedroom and you need it to be quiet, it's NOT. If you want a fan that moves air, this is the one."
5,Best 12 Volt Fan,"I purchased this fan for use on my dog crates when I transport them during the warmer months.Unlike many crate fans this fan is large enough to move sufficient volumes of air and the variable speed allows you to adjust the fan speed to the temperature. Mounting the fan is simple with the pre-attached swing out clips on the top of the fan that hook onto the crate door. My only complaint is the clips would not hook into the grate style door of my XL size Vari Kennel brand crate, however it works great on my other crates. The spacing on the Vari Kennel grate is too small to allow the hooks to engage properly. I was able to tie the fan to the front of the crate door using the handle on top of the fan and it works great.This is a sturdy,quiet,well made product."
3,"Good, however, poorly documented product",The Fan Tastic Vent Corp 01100WH Endless Breeze 12V Volt Fan is an acceptably good product and would probably rate a 4/5 on value... I kinda like it but it's a tad bit expensive.What you don't know is its power draw and that's a big deal to those of us living inside battery constraints. I have measured it and I'll share:low: 15 Watts or 1.25 amps @ 12 VDCmedium: 27 Watts or 2.25 ampshigh: 35 Watts or close to 3 ampsBut... Fan-Tastic should have published that! The fact that *I* had to document their product cost 'em a star!
5,Dogs love this fan,"I have been using this fan for my dogs at dog shows this summer, it is very powerful and is way better then those tiny crate fans. I and my dogs love this fan!"
5,great fan,"I put this fan in my boat, ran all night on low speed with plenty of air and was able to start my engine the following morning."
1,nice while it worked,I took this fan on its first RV trip this weekend and it stopped working after a few hours. Has been attempted using many different power sources and still will not turn on. I have written the dealer and hope to hear back from them regarding my purchase through amazon.
2,Poorly made fan,"This fan has only two speeds. It is marked 3 speed, but two settings are exactly the same speed. I would never recommend this fan to anyone. It pushes air, but poorly made."
1,Lame!,I actually read the reviews for this before buying and have NO idea why I didn't listen to them. This is NOT a training video. This is a cheesy attempt for loser wrestlers to make a name for themselves by painting their faces different colors and acting out little skits. So lame. Good luck with you wrestling careers lameos.
2,A Bit Disapponting,"I like Jessica's voice, but I don't like the productiion values on this album. It's mostly pop, with the instruments drowning out Jessica's voice. And the volume from one track to another is uneven. I found myself having to adjust the volume on my CD player frequently."
3,"Almost, almost..... Better title: Confusion.","Can see what writer and movie director were trying to do, show and they sort of pull it off BUT this topic would be hard for anyone to capture in a 2 or 3 hour film. Did like how movie switches back and forth, letting viewer experience confusion but confusion is about all one gets from this. Not a date movie. Not a comedy. Not funny. Oh, no sound track, which I do like. No dramatic, over done, musical score. But in the end, not sure I gained a lot of insight into the mind of the main character or other characters. Worth a look?? I not sure. Did not hate film nor love it. Does show its independent film production side with poor microphone work in places. Also not satisfied with ending at all. Confusion again and that is what I would say sums up this movie ""confusion"". Not recommended."
2,Create your own ending,"This movie had potential but it's main storyline is left undeveloped. This is the only movie I've ever seen that didn't have an ending. It went to black and I thought the video went out on me but then the ending credits started and I thought, ""what the f...?""They never fully explained the ""Marlene"" part of her name. It started to, but as with most of this movie, some things were just ideas that seemed to fall flat.The actors were great in their rolls, but it was a poor script that never managed to wrap itself back around to make any sense.I heard so many good reviews when this movie came out that I really expected something far better. However, when a movie doesn't resolve itself and has a screwy ending that leaves the viewer wondering what just happened, it's not good.If I was in a movie theatre, I'd demand my money back."
3,Not as good as I was expecting,I definitely expected more after hearing the reviews when it 1st came out but it was disappointing & the ending was horribly unsatisfying. Great acting by Elizabeth but not a great movie.
2,Slow and disappointing,"I was really excited about seeing this film, after reading so many 5-star, rave reviews from both critics and the general public. The story and subject matter sounded very interesting, and I was expecting great things. Unfortunately, for me, there just wasn't enough substance to the story, and the constant flashbacks were distracting. Other than a couple of violent scenes, there was no excitement, no plot. It just seemed like a long and pointless story about a disturbed young woman and her well-meaning sister. In the end, we are left to wonder if she was ever able to get well and leave the demons of the past behind her. Very little story and no clear ending....that's about all I have to say. One more thing: Elizabeth Olsen did a fantastic job in her role, but I honestly did not find myself rooting for this character as much as I wanted to."
2,Really?,"I must have very different tastes than most others, but I just plain didn't enjoy this film. Strange, sudden ending to which I couldn't determine the significance."
2,Didn't do it for me,"Good acting and so much promise in the plot but the ending, or lack thereof, will leave many disappointed and wishing they hadn't paid the price of admission."
3,3 Stars only because of Olsen's acting,"*SPOILER WARNING !The 3 Star rating was for the acting of Elizabeth Olsen, the main character.I despised the ending.There were no consequences for the cult's criminal behavior..The cult just letting themselves into someone's house and killing the owner for nothing was reason alone to want to see them Busted.A commune cult with a revolting entitlement attitude.I'm glad I only caught this on one of my existing movie channels.Otherwise, I'd want my money back."
3,Meh...Left me empty,"I really enjoy stories of people who have become ""lost"" in their lives but this story left me feeling empty. It would have been a much better story if we had gotten more of the girl's back-story...what made her go searching? what caused the emptiness in her life that made her susceptible to a self-made guru? what was she thinking??? This was just a sad story that went no where. In the end I got frustrated and just didn't care anymore."
4,4 X M,"I watched this movie, and it wasn't a bad movie; However, after watching the Short (which was included in the Extras)that was a precursor (15-20 minutes long) to this movie, I believe the movie would have been much, much better, if this information/video had been included in the actual movie, although a much longer movie, it would have been well worth it for the viewer. Definitely a well made movie."
1,A waste of time,"The acting in this film is actually pretty decent, however, the story is a total dud. I think that pretty well sums it up."
1,kept waiting for somthing to happen,"A little boring, good acting by Miss Olson (can't remember her first name). Story is a little strange, cultish. Not a thriller in my opinion. don't watch this if you are tired at all because you may fall asleep. I hate movies where nothing happens, most of the movie is a recollection of trauma to this girl. The girl shows her boobs :)"
3,"Strange, yet hauntingly good","I heard a lot of things about Elizabeth Olsen's debut role in MMMM. I understand that Martha (Olsen) was a frightened, broken young woman, but at times I didn't feel very connected to her as a viewer. As viewers, we are not supposed to feel connected or close to Martha. Olsen is fantastic at portraying the lead character. The film is unsettling, and captivating as Martha continues to unravel and show the affects of the cult in her present life.Most of the movie was slow, and it shifted between past and present, both were features that I liked. Elizabeth's performance is pretty remarkable. She has the talent to carry the entire film and the cinematography is beautiful. My only disappointment with the movie overall was that it felt like something was missing. The acting is excellent. Olsen is hands-down the best part of the movie. However, given the film's subject matter, it's understandable that Martha's past, present, or future are not clear. 3.5 stars."
2,Disappointing,Thought there would be resolve. No resolve to this story line as it's more about imagery and the creator than it is the viewer.
2,Boring and incomplete.,"This might have been a good movie if it the whole story was shown. As it is, the story is very slow to develop and there is not much character or plot development."
2,Bland,"Although the acting was good, the movie itself was slow, disjointed, and had no ending. I think it was supposed to be a very clever way to let you make up your own, but it didn't give us enough material. It just never seemed to get off the ground. Bland.."
1,MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE,"I gave it one star because it got here, but I can't play it, so something is wrong with it. Please have the sender send another one, and/or let me know how I can get my money back."
2,I was disappointed.,"After reading all of the positive reviews,I was looking forward to this,unfortunately,I was disappointed.I don't think it's worth a $3.99 rental,wait for it to be available at Redbox.Two other indie movies I've seen on Amazon. Whistleblower and Puncture,both true stories, I liked a lot more.Would like to see Elizabeth Olsen in another movie.Her performance is fine,all the actors are fine,it was more the script and dialogue,or lack of it, I didn't like."
1,Very disappointing!,I thought this movie was dull and boring from start to finish. A definite waste of time and about as intriguing as watching the grass grow....
1,what was the point?,I'm sorry to say that this was a total waste of time and money. Absolutely baffled that this was ever made. Insulting.
1,Boring,This movie was so boring. i thought that the story was good but it could of been played better. the only thing i could say about this movie that i liked was that it was realistic. that stuff happens. but all in all the movie was slow and boring. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you don't
1,dont waste your money,"good plot , kept waiting for it to take-off ! never did ! if you like a movie with no climax , then this movie is for you !"
1,Baffling Boring Bad Banal,"There's a terrific movie waiting to be written about communal cults, but this isn't it. The pacing is turgid, the dialogue is pedestrian, the lighting is annoyingly murky and all the actors seem to be on Thorazine.As for all the praise for Elizabeth Olsen, I can only assume the enthusiasm is just carried over from her more famous, older twin sisters. She's unattractive and chubby, with appalling posture. And she simply cannot act.Viewing this film was like watching a teenage girl sulk for two hours - which, now that I think about it - is exactly what the film was."
4,Intense,Very good movie. Elizabeth Olsen is an incredible actress. This movie is very intense & has some very disturbing scenes. It also leaves you wanting more for Elizabeth Olsens character.
5,Cults R Us,"This movie isn't for everyone... if you're one of those people who can't handle a plot which takes its time to develop, avoid this like the plague, because you'll be complaining that it's ""too slow"".However, if you're like me and actually appreciate that type of movie, this is one of the best movies of 2011, and easily THE BEST MOVIE EVER on the subject of cults and brainwashing. Elizabeth Olsen would have received an Oscar nomination in a just world, but since this movie wasn't touched by Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg and didn't have a Holocaust/Gender-Bending/Period-Piece theme, it apparently wasn't worthy Oscar-Bait and she was snubbed.To give away any of the plot would spoil the movie, so I'll just wrap it up by saying that anyone interested in cults and independant movies needs to see this."
3,A critic's favorite...but.,"Good acting. I basically liked the plot. A girl, Martha Marcy Mae Marleen, played by Elizabeth Olsen escapes from a cult and it's charasmatic, manipulative and evil leader. There were some interesting parallels between the Manson Family and the cult in this movie. She gets help from her sister and her husband, but is struggling with the adjustment to a more normal life and there is a dark secret. Martha's life with the cult and her time with her sister is presented as a parallel, switching back and forth between the two. It seems to be universally agreed that Elisabeth Olsen is excellent and John Hawkes makes a fine cult leader and psychopath. For me, the pacing was slow, but I'm kind of a fidgety person anyway. Also, this is not a movie for those that like a neat wrap up. The movie culls a lot of anticipation, but may leave you feeling unsatisfied."
4,"What it is, what it isn't","It's not an action film: it's a psychological movie.This is one of the most intelligent psychological movies I've seen. I was riveted to my seat to see where Martha's decision to leave the cult would take her: the movie concists of a series of revelations about what she does and doesn't understand now that she's outside of the cult. In spite of her escape from the farm, it's as if her mind is under water, struggling to emerge into clarity and complete rejection of the cult, but her mind is still controlled by the cult's influence. It's pretty horrifying for the viewer to grasp just how delusional she has become in the company of psychopaths, and I was not at all disappointed by the end of the movie. Are we surprised that she is as passive as she has been throughout the film? No: her will has been just about completely broken by Patrick.After it ended, I said to myself, That is the scariest film I've seen since ""Silence of the Lambs."""
5,Slow burn creep.,"Slow, unsettling film. Elizabeth Olsen is amazing, as is the rest of the cast. I've recommended the film to others; however, please keep in mind it's not a feel-good film nor a thriller."
4,Feels disturbingly real.,"Mixing current, past and maybe never Martha is a very unsettling movie and girl. All the actors and actress were good to great (great Hawkes and Olsen)"
5,"perefect for our ""baby"" peyton (16 inch lifelike vinyl doll)",It looks just like the real thing! My daughter was thrilled with it. She dresses her doll up and carries her around the house all the time in it. Very sturdy.
5,doll car seat,"this is a wonderful accessory for the stroller & is every little girls dream, it's just like ""mommy's"". a fantastic gift & made well !!!"
5,So real it's scary,"This carseat is so cool. Bought this for my daughters baby alive. She fits ""safely"" in it and looks so real. Love that it has latch as well. My only issue is that it is heavier that your average doll carseat and the base is not easy to snap off the carseat. I highly recommend this product!!!!!"
3,R.E.M.'s Last Stand.,This is the last good album R.E.M. made before Michael Stipe realized he was a STAR (feel free to laugh here)....
4,"dreary, mystical, enjoyable","Although this album is indeed a departure from previous (and latter) R.E.M. takes, it is a very enjoyable listening experience. You may find reassurance, understanding, wisdom, and many other things in this album, but you probably won't hear anything to cheer you up in the traditional sense of the word. Some of the most beautiful REM songs (in my opinion) are found on this album: Feeling Gravity's Pull, Maps and Legends (get the import edition for an accoustic version also), Green Grow the Rushes, Good Advices, and Wendell Gee. It has been said that people either love this album or hate it. I appreciate this album for its vivid construction and imagery, and the overall cohesiveness (give or take Cant Get There From Here (an oddity)) of it. Because I love REM, I would naturally say you should buy this. However, it would probably be wise to start with Document, Out of Time, or Automatic for the People, if you don't own any REM already."
4,Dear Old 1985,"The Minutemen, The Replacements, Huskers, and this disc on college radio--a band at their most mysterious. Unfocused and the product of a group in turmoil, it's also probably their most evocative and ""folkie"" album. Joe Boyd, who produced Fairport Convention and the first (I think) 10,000 Maniacs album spins the dials here. ""Maps and Legends"" and ""Kohoutek"" are nothing but dark exercises in mid-80s jangle, however uniquely REM: decadent dead ends. But every song is transporting and mood-altering in a way that no band--lest of all REM these days--can, or would even bother, to match.I can't actually believe this disc is 15 years old (as of now, of course)."
5,Fables... is why,I fell in love with REM back in the mid eighties in college and also why I struggled to stay with them as they forged their way artistically towards a new direction. Some would call it sucumbing to the pressure but this album alone makes it all OK. I still love REM. I am just no longer crazy about their music. This album will always remain an poetically brilliant piece of stand alone work by a band who perhaps had every odd stacked against them when they put out this impossible-to-top album.
4,Classic Indie,"Produced in stressful times with an unfamiliar producer, this is the start of the three album plateau (starts here and ends with Document). All the familiar elements are here and in perfect balance. The band realizes what it has to offer and delivers. Obtuse and arcanely catchy. For me, it all goes downhill with the questionable Green. I know that admitting that I actually liked REM, albeit for short period of time, will tag me as a fan but this album holds a certain fondness. Like an early ex-girlfriend."
4,The palindrome album.,"R.E.M.'s darkest and most obtuse release, 'Fables' was THE alternative music album of 1985. It perfects the sound of the band's previous albums and represents the end of their ""jangly guitar mumbly vocals"" period. Slightly more inconsistent than 'Murmur' or 'Reckoning', yet far more musically accomplished, 'Fables' is a dark meditation on folk music and the rural South, and perfectly encapsulates the mystical aura of Michael Stipe. An essential album of the 80's."
5,"My first R.E.M. album... so underrated, so beautiful","This was the first R.E.M. LP I bought (yes, on vinyl, thank you very much.) I've always judged their sound by this record, and so in a lot of ways, I suppose I'm an old-school R.E.M. fan. This was the album I listened to the most when I was at UGA in Athens, certainly not ""Automatic for the People,"" their total ""please, sir, may I have a Grammy?"" sell-out album after making ""Out of Time"" (which itself is the second-most underrated album, after ""Fables."")This album sums up to me what R.E.M. was about -- murkiness, indecipherable lyrics and... well, barbecue. This album smells of barbecue sauce to me, does that make sense?Philomath, they know the low-down, indeed."
3,Definitely worth a listen,"After breaking ground with Murmur and going into a holding pattern with Reckoning, R.E.M. tried experimenting with darker moods on Fables of the Reconstruction. The overall result is spotty. The mix is so poor in some songs that singer Michael Stipe sounds as if he is on another floor (not that his singing was very clear to begin with). However, there are some good tracks on here. Many songs focus on a murky side R.E.M. would not explore until much later in their career. My favourites are the more melodic tunes such as ""Green Grow the Rushes,"" ""Good Advices,"" and ""Wendell Gee."" Though I wouldn't recommend this album for newcomers to R.E.M., it is an album worth hearing once you become a fan. It is a point in their career where they took one step back before taking two steps forward with their next release, Lifes Rich Pageant."
4,Give 'em credit for experimenting,"R.E.M. was determined that they wouldn't fall into a rut. After two classic, but similar sounding albums, they incorporated horns and other studio flourishes into their third album--with mixed results. Not to say there aren't still some great tunes. ""Can't Get There From Here,"" ""Green Grow the Rushes,"" and ""Wendell Gee,"" for example, are superior songs. The album lacks only the superior consistency of the first two."
4,Classic R.E.M.,"As a native Georgian and former resident of Athens, I grew up listening to R.E.M. To me there is something distinctly Southern about the band's first three albums. The instrumentation, mystical lyrics and weird characters are a perfect representation of the Deep South. Fables makes me think of rainy days, pine trees, kudzu fields and junkyards. I think it is a great album, and although REM's later records are all good, in my mind they gradually lost that unique feel and became more of a pop band."
4,"Good in theory, but look out if you own a SAAB.","Tried this on a 2000 SAAB 9-3 and there's just no way you can get the tube far enough down to extract more than 1/2 the oil. But I'm rating this 4 stars because the product worked effectively when it could pull oil...easy to use, not too bad to clean up, easy to store away. Didn't work out for me but I can't penalize the manufacturer for my car's layout. Just beware of claims that it'll work on any and all motors."
3,Hydro turf oil extractor,It works but the drain tube is too small in diameter and it takes forever to pump the oil out thru the dipstick.
5,easy oil change,Just right for the individual auto owner works like a champ just fallow the directions....... For all your oil change jobs esp the 9in rear end has no drain plug....... this extractor works wonders!!!!!!!
3,ok,"product works,but takes forever to get the oil out....its a good workout though otherwise it is ok just thought it would be faster"
5,"Used for extracting oil from a Seadoo, worked great.","I was really unsure about this product before buying. I needed a pump to remove the oil from my Seadoo and had used a drill type before which was always messy and required both hands. I bought the Hydro Turf to give it a try after reading reviews. I did warm up the Seadoo before starting. My Seadoo was on a floating pad connected to my boat dock and after a few pumps the oil was moving. Not real fast but was what I expected. It took maybe 5 minutes to empty the Seadoo oil pan. Best part, NO MESS! All the oil was contained and I was able to pour the oil into disposal container easily with nozzle provided. Great product."
5,Great oil Extractor,I used this on 3 small engines. I was amazed at how great it worked.It was easy to setup and use.
2,"Arrived early and looked exactly as portrayed - ""On target - on time"".","Product failed at the beginning of the first use on a relatively new Kubota RTV 500. Directions were followed and the oil extraction tube inserted through the oil dipstick tube went in with no effort. Before pumping up the unit, I tried to bring the extraction tube out a little, and although I never felt it hit bottom, it became stuck somewhere in the oil pan. The oil was drained manualIy, and new oil extraction tube remains inside the oil pan. System failure. The extraction tube was cut off, dipstick reinserted, and after talking with the Kubota folks, I will end up taking the Kubota to the dealer to pull the engine, remove the oil pan and remove the oil extraction tube. I would call your dealer if you plan on using this product for any ATV type vehicle."
4,LOCATE YOUR OIL FILTER FIRST,"I own a 2011 Hyundai Elantra. I bought this oil extractor befoe I checked the location of my oil filter. I have to lift the car to get to the oil filter, the car is too low for me to crawl under it, and the oil filter is not accessible from the top of the engine. Thus, the oil extractor is not going to be helpful to me."
1,Bogus,I would say that if there is no way to get at the engine's drain plug then it's better than nothing. I used it on my Acura then afterwards broke open the drain plug and drained out the rest from the oil pan. I would have to say there was almost half of the old oil left in the engine. It's not a quick fix or an easy way to do the job right. Any way you look at it if you want to git 'er done right you still have to crawl around on your back!
4,Helpful device!,"I needed to assist a friend by removing oil from his car as he had overfilled. Although the oil extractor was slow, it was much easier than having to get under the car and remove the oil plug."
4,"Works, but...","I got it to change the oil on my Chryslers, and it does the job well once you trim off a bit of the outer plastic covering the tubing. Otherwise, it's a great alternative to removing the oil plug under the car - all I have to do is unscrew the the filter after draining the pan. Some may complain about having to still get down there for the filter, but I'm not one of them. I appreciate the convenience and use this on all my oil changes now."
3,lesser known Engel film,Weddings and Babies was one of Morris Engel's follow ups to Little Fugitive. It isn't as charming or good as that film but then it is a more serious film.John Myhers plays a photographer who is sick of filming weddings and babies but that is just what his girlfriend wants (Viveca Lindfors). The presence of his declining grandmother entering into the picture only makes things worst. He has to question the direction in his life.The New York setting is made to good use. The settings are photographed well. Engel was a photographer before hand so possibly there is an autographical edge to this movie. 2.5 rounded to 3.
1,Cuff Unravels & Frays,"I've bought these socks from FootSmart over the past several years and loved them. Recently, I bought three more pairs of the socks from FootSmart and after one or two washings the tops of the cuffs started to unravel and get frayed. They continue to do so. FootSmart must have a different supplier. Would not buy again!"
4,Great CD,"Kathleen Hanna has been able to get her message out again, in a great and creative way. Wonderful album."
2,Disapointed,"As much as I love Kathleen Hanna, I was extremely disapointed in this album. It's so techno-y. It's deffinetly something cool for my collection but, in all actuallity though, it's dust collector. So, if you do buy this cd, don't expect anything Bikini Kill-esque."
1,Hannah is a loud-mouthed windbag,Her anti-everything rhetoric has been old for years now and her writer pal Lois needs to jump on a new sinking ship.
5,julie ruin rocks my world,"kathleen hannah has once again amazed me with her talents. this album comes highly reccommended not only to fans of her past work in bikini kill, but also to those into lo-fi, rap, hip hop, and other underground/indie genres. 'i wanna know what love is' is my favorite song on this album, but each track has it's own personality. the opening lines of the second verse reminds me of what suburban white girl feminist gangsta rap would be like if there were such a thing. this is powerful music for people who aren't afraid of things that aren't always pretty. this album is a true work of art from an inspiring artist. 'stay monkey' is another standout track. if you're into what's happening in the future of feminism, lo-fi, and electronic music, be sure to check this cd out."
4,It grew on me.,"I hadn't ever listened to Bikini Kill before I bought this album, but I had read a lot about them and decided I'd give them a try. Then Julie Ruin came out, and I thought, what the heck, let's give Kathleen's solo effort a try first. I was definitely NOT expecting her baby-girl voice--I had something PJ Harvey-esque in mind--and I was turned way off by the pedantic song-writing (especially on ""I Wanna Know What Love Is""). But I gave it a few more listens, and I've decided I really like this disc. ""Aerobicide"" is my favorite song to listen to on the way to work in the mornings, and I love ""V.G.I."" (""I wear a scrunchie"" could be my favorite line on the whole disc). ""Stay Monkey"" really showcases Kathleen's vocal talent, which sometimes gets lost on other songs, and I like the quirkiness of ""Crochet"" and ""On Language."" What can I say? It grew on me."
3,"Good writing, Big goofs in Reviews","This is for the VB6 Version of the book:The style of writing made the material easy to digest, and more simplistic items were easily skipped without losing key concepts. However, the Review Exams at the end of each chapter were fraught with errors in the answers. It could be quite confusing for someone who isn't already familiar with VB and SQL. The text generally explains things correctly though.Based on looking at a few of the VB5 version complaints, it looks like Sybex hasn't figured it out yet."
1,Get A Different book to Study for the exam!,"Mistakes, mistakes everywhere! When following instructions to create a practice application, the code was wrong, it didn't work! Even the CD-ROM stuff was incorrect. Studying for these cert tests is tough enough without the added frustration of textbooks proclaiming to be ""Study Guides"" that are riddled with gross errors. I ended up using Microsoft's VB Programmers Guide and the Visual Basic 5.0 online documentation. I passed the certification test (hurrah) but certainly NOT due to any help from this book! Don't people read/edit or review this stuff? Doesn't the author check to be sure his code produces the desired results?"
4,Very Good Book But Not Enough For the Exam,"This is a very good book to start preparing for Exam 70-165. All the exam topics are covered and the topics are well explained. However, the book lacks details on some important topics like the Setup wizard (Bootstrap files, ini files, primary and secondary cab files) and ActiveX controls (Ambient and Extender properties). However, its very good for its price. I used this book, VB Books online and the transcenders and passed exam 70-165 with a good score on my first attempt."
1,Buy a different book.,"This book, despite its acceptable editing and writing standards, just does not contain a large amount of material needed to pass the exam. Either buy one of the 1300-pagers or Exam Cram, or both. This book is the worst of both worlds unfortunately."
2,"Not for novice programmers, CDROM test not working right","This book is ok for advanced-level learning, if you don't know code well though, forget it, because he does not guide you through the examples well. I found also that the CDROM practice test did not work well. I have been through Halverson's ""Step By Step"" book, and it was very well written, but did not cover a lot of ground. I am now using the Waite Group's book, and I think that it is the best."
2,"Good book, but test-engine is a disaster","The book was very good, even though a bit slow and repetitive at times. But a test-engine on the CD-ROM seemed to be full of bugs(or was it my computer?). It didn't mark or didn't count all the correct answers. As a result final score showed about 10% less grade than there was. At least it displayed the correct answers, so I was able to learn something. All in all I liked New Riders book better."
2,Not comprehensive enough,"This wasn't a bad book but I was disappointed because it seemed to ignore advanced topics. For example, the discussion on asynchronous objects basically tells you to create an early bound object with events. There is no discussion at all of the merits of call backs versus events, which is an important topic. Another example, the discussion on distribution manages to avoid licensing issues such as vbl files and lpk files.You definately need to supplement this book with other material. I used the Transcender exams and passed in the mid 900s."
2,Not very well written,"I usually like older books for kids, and the facts in the book were interesting, but the tone and style was off-putting. Short, choppy sentences as if speaking to a six y/o, but the content well above the head of a six y/o. I am almost never bored by a book (disgusted or irritated, yes, but not bored) but this book was boring."
5,When you fall alseep,"Your body changes from its old body, to a new body with no feelings or no emosions or pain."
1,Cheaply produced remake,"There are a number of good remakes of The Body Snatcher, but don't waste your time with this one. It's is a very cheap production, poor special effects, completely unoriginal."
3,Where are you going to hide?,"While this is not the best of the three versions of Jack Finney's story it is still an enjoyable adaptation. I get the impression that it is meant to be a sequel of sorts to the 1978 Kaufman film, shifting the location from San Francisco to an army base.Lacking the suspense and paranoia of its two predecessors the film manages to lift itself above potential mediocrity. Its a fun way to pass the time and does not drag on for too long, but don't expect anything thought provoking or scary.The DVD transfer is quite good, apart from very slight artefacting during the opening titles. The major letdown is the lack of features - no trailer, no commentary (surely Robert H Solo could have said something, explaining why he produced 2 different versions of the story?)."
2,Two out of three ain't bad...,"The Least Successful of the Body Snatcher Movies..., for a reason, the movie was so slow that I fell sleep the first time I watched it! I'm a big fan of Jack Finney's book ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" (1954). The first two movies (1956 & 1978) were great because in their own way, each faithfully depicted the atmosphere of total dispair found in the book. This installment didn't adhere very well to the mood or the original plot, at the same time it didn't bring any innovation to the story line, the way that the 1978 version did. If you're a fan of ""Invasion..."", I don't recomend it. If you are watching it for the horror aspect, eigther of the first two is superior to this one. I also recomend, John Carpenter's: ""The Thing""; and Robert Heilein's: ""The Puppet Masters"", staring Donald Southerland."
3,Analogies Of All Eras,"I have only caught sight of this movie on cable in the past few weeks, and I find it thoughtfully disturbing. While the 1956 original is often thought of as a parody of Communistic paranoia, this one is definitely a comment on the AIDS virus and how it operates. Just as HIV attacks the body's immune system,the pods here take over a military base-the first line of defense against any invasion.Not only that, they turn the military into a means of distribution, spreading themselves around to other bases.Those who escape become ""antibodies"", fighting off the infection."
3,"TV style ""Snatchers""","Having enjoyed the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" movies, I looked forward to seeing this one years ago. I still find the tie-in like a TV series version (except for the pleasant brief nudity -- note that Meg Tilly's nude scene was by a double ""Jennifer"" [Jennifer Tilley?].The story line works as tension builds with acceptable character development first. Anyway, it gives you a triolgy set."
2,Cheap Imitation,"This third implementation of the great classic does have its moments but overall, it is no match to the 70s classic with Donald Sutherland. Perhaps worth a view but not a purchase."
3,Body Snatchers Review,"This second remake of Invasion of Body Snatchers (the previous two being the 1956 one by Don Siegel and the 1978 one by Philip Kaufman) is not--in my opinion--as suspenseful as the other two; nevertheless, it is quite watchable and entertaining. Forest Whitaker and Christine Elise are very good in this film. The 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is enhanced and of high quality."
1,"Not a 1/2"" shank","The description says it has 1/2"" shank. But, when it arrived it had a 3/8"" shank. When I called them about it, they said they would replace it the correct bit. But, when they received the return they latter refused to replace it."
4,This product had a great taste. My wife ...,This product had a great taste. My wife loved how wonderful my breath smelled and I liked the fresh feeling it left in my mouth. This product is superior to other mouthwashes like Listerine and Scope because it doesn't have a medicine-like aftertaste.
1,While this is a great alternative to the ...,"While this is a great alternative to the other mouthwashes, I didn't like the taste or the way it felt in my mouth. My roommate, on the other hand, loved it. He didn't mind the non-sweet taste and actually preferred that over the usual Mentadent we use. I, however, wouldn't recommend this product"
4,This mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and ...,"This mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. However, I don't think that the taste is as good as that of Tom's toothpaste. I am glad that Tom's has made a mouthwash though, because natural mouthwash is not easy to find."
3,I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or ...,"I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or family. I'm looking for great taste when I purchase a mouthwash. While I certainly like that Tom's uses all natural ingredients, it didn't have the zing"""" that I was hoping for. It actually tasted very weak (i.e., diluted). It's probably best for people who want """"all natural"""" as their top priority."
4,I really liked the taste of it and ...,"I really liked the taste of it and it was very refreshing. I'd buy this product again. It wasn't as strong as some mouthwashes, which I really liked. It didn't burn but still felt like it was working."
2,"If you can't get your pendents on it, how good can it be","I own over 100 pendents. Of them, I found only about 8% had holes large enough to thread this through them. More thought should have been given to practical aspects of this cord."
4,Looks Nice,Quality of leather looks nice. I can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off. It's metal squeazed to leather and that's what I expected. You just have to keep an eye on it and don't sleep or shower in it. It looks nice.
5,"Good value, Good Piece","Hey, itsa necklace, but wear it alone, put a pendant on it (When you can get back from your spouse), or jus torder more than one....One of many happy purchases from this vendor"
3,Decent in a fix,"I've never had horrible shaves but I've definitely had improved shaves with a good shaving cream.I've used different Skintimate products. Generally, they smell pleasant but not great. It's not different with this one. My legs feel fine afterward but the gel is rather thick and could spread more easily. It also doesn't seem to soften the hair on my legs as much as other products (such as Satin Care).While not a horrible product, this could definitely be improved."
3,"I thought, perhaps, it could have made my ...","I thought, perhaps, it could have made my legs feel a bit smoother while shaving. Maybe if it were more gel-like, instead of a cream. Also, I thought that perhaps the fragrance could have been a bit stronger. Other than that, I didn't have any problems with it. I'd probably purchase it again, although I don't think I'd recommend it to my family or friends."
4,Page turning introduction to V.I.,"I've read most of the V.I. Warshawski series as they were released and thought I know Vic pretty well. However, this first book in the series proved an unexpected source of new insights on one of the leading ladies of PI fiction. Some of it was simply background stuff. More interesting was just getting a sense of who she is and why she ticks.The mystery is interesting enough. A University of Chicago student has gone missing. Before she can blink, VI is immersed in a murder mystery with links to big insurance, a sleazy union and a very dangerous mobster. Still, her sarcastic humor and basic good heart come through as we tour greater Chicago. The pages turn easily.Bottom line: Certainly a good read for those who are new to the series and not a bad read for longtime fans."
3,Snappy first novel,"Good story, good first person character. This is the author's first novel with V I Warshawski.Book became a bestseller and the series became bestselling history. My one BIG complaint? Paretsky has never met an ly adverb she didn't like. What annoyed, and took away the fun, for me were her attributions: I said shortly, I said flatly, I said shortly, again, So many adverbs to short cut descriptions of how V I sounds; where was the editor? Why oh why such hack usage? I pray, hope, I incant, that the author trusts her own writing and her readers enough to quit ""telling"" the reader how she sounds when V I speaks."
4,Indemnity only,"Haven't read Sarah Paretsky for a long time and just re-discovered her! I love her style, her descriptions of people including accents/jargon, it's like watching a movie!"
4,Entertaining. Good book for the beach.,"I found this book to be entertaining and I enjoyed it except for some of the typos. For example: ""the row of glasses disolved into a pooh of red blood, it way my mother's.......""? What ever happened to proofreaders?"
5,A New Gal on the Street,"The mean streets of Chicago have gotten a new addition to the tough investigators who troll back allies to keep them clean. Sara Paretsky's introduction to PI V.I. Warshawski in INDEMNITY ONLY will have you singing ""Mean Woman Blues.""Warshawski's crust is hard as nails, but her heart beats to a different tune. A girl is missing as reported by a client who prefers to remain anonymous. Then V.I. stumbles across the body of the girl's boy friend and the sparks fly as the Chicago police try to brush V.I. off the scene.Mix in a few other problems and you have to beginning of one of the most enduring PI's in detective land.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,INDEMNITY Only,Great book. I really enjoy reading Sara's books. She is a great story teller and Vic is a great detective.
3,Just ok,"I was looking for another author in the Raymond Chandler vein. These books are ok but lack the snappy, crispness of dialog and some of the general mood I was looking for."
4,How do you continue to rate books when there are so many,I must be masiocistic or something like that as I continue to read these stories that are beginning to sound the same with different titles. She's so inept at times and so good at others. I can't tell you why I read on and on.
5,Love that V.I.,"Hats off to Sara and V.I. I love this series, and I love this book. Keep 'em coming, Sara! Highly recommended."
3,TO PUT,"TO PUT movies regarding on Armageddon and in fact dealing with any Bible Books! I think it could be written out, directed and more importantly dealt with the truth as like the Bible said it happen. I mean with all the highly technology and special effects we have today, it's no reason not to make the movie as the Bible read as it was in what the writer said as it was and as it happen and as God Himself told his people what to say in his Book The Holy Bible; and God will not let no one write lies about what he said, period.J. Keller"
5,One of the finest fantasy novels ever written,"This is one of a few of Van's novels that on the first reading I thought was absolute garbage, but on second reading I thought it was absolutely brilliant. This is not a book to be read and rationalized, but a book to be enjoyed as one would a fantastic dream. The writings of Lord Dunsany and the Dreamworld saga of Lovecraft are similar to this book's style. The plot is, yes, bizarre and often illogical, but that is a great strength rather than a fault. Surrealism permeats this novel, and when you have finished reading it you will remember it like you would a fabulous hazy dream."
4,a slice of life of L.A. coolcountry -pop,"good stuff with also Sneaky Pete , Jay DEE Manness, Hal Blaine, and other good musicians of the era! it's folk- pop with orchestra, country tinted with peddle -steel, slightly corny, but genuinly real like it was at that time. Beverly Hills meets Hillbilly/honky-tonk classy country rock. it's an enjoyable mixture of country accoustic , symphonic classic pop , all played by some of the top of the crop in the country- pop- music world. this album is a real jem that has been finally released after all these years on cd."
3,"OK, not great","Lightweight, passable suction, but doesn't really get the stuff out of the rugs like my hoover.... the worst part about this machine is that it really gets hot, really quickly. I'm not sure why, but it gets so hot I shut it off 2 or 3 times while I'm using it to let it cool down. Also, there's a filter that's a pain to clean. But the vacuum was [inexpensive]. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,WORST PURCHASE I EVER MADE,"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE, IT HAS NO POWER AT ALL, AND GETS HOT REALLY FAST, IT'S OK FOR SMALL PLACES OR FAST PICK-UPS, BUT IT DOESN'T DO THE JOB I NEED DONE IN MY HOUSE, ANOTHER THING TO STORE IN THE SHED"
1,A Waiste of Time and Money,"I purchased this machine from another company. It worked wonderfully....for about a week. I also purchased an overpriced powered capret attachment from the company (which never worked).The end result is over $200 spent and a vacuum that is absolutely useless.I live in an apartment with low pile carpets and tile floors. Presently, I cannot even pick up a piece of lint if I get on my hands and knees and place the hose directly on the carpet.Forget trying to pick up cat hair....it cannot maintain any suction whatsoever.Purchasing a vacuum is confusing and the reviews often contradict one another, but I can tell you that if this company was the last one on earth that manufactured vacuums, I would buy a lint roller first. The lint roller would collect more!You have been warned!"
1,Where are the illustrations?,"This book is available at The Project Gutenberg, however I wanted a copy on the Kindle that I could carry with me. The useful text is all there, but unless I'm missing something major, the illustrations that are so helpful in understanding and appreciating the work are missing. What a waste. At least it was only a few dollars. I think Amazon needs to make note when illustrations are missing, especially when the publication is about the items being illustrated."
1,UNSAFE!!!,"This may be a convenient solution sometimes but it is a BAD one. 125v 20 Amp equipment can ONLY be plugged into a 5ALT-20R or 5-20R socket. (NEMA reference codes) Meaning if it has one vertical spade and one horizontal spade IT DOESN""T FIT IN YOUR SOCKET FOR A GOOD REASON! It doesn't matter if this adapter is a heavy gauge or not, it is being plugged into something that is not rated for 20A. This product is NOT UL listed meaning they have recognized that it is not a safe product. Don't risk damaging equipment, facilities or even worse causing injury or possibly even death. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!"
5,PERFECT!,"I use this to convert my 120v 20amp tanning bed plug to a normal 15amp plug. Previously I had to change the receptacle every time we moved to a new apartment (most new construction can handle a little increased ampage without actually having a 20 amp line, plus the bed only draws like 18 amps or something) but it has been a great convenience! I'm surprised this even exists, seems like it would totally break code, but I love it and I love my tanning bed!"
2,"This is a functional adapter, but it is NOT a Furman ADP-1520. I was tricked!","You can find photos of the Furman ADP-1520 online at sweetwater DOT com. Imagine my surprise when I opened this package and got a knock-off cable without the requisite breaker for safety!That's right. It's a 20 AMP to 15 AMP adapter cable and to save money the manufacturer omitted the current overload breaker switch. When I saw the posted photo I thought the button was on the other side or something, but no such luck.Claiming it's a Furman ADP-1520 is simply fraudulent in my view. Only buy this if you don't mind getting a cable without the safety features."
4,Good Primer for serious students and parents!,Though high schoolers find this video a bit dry it is an excellent resource. If a student will really watch this video and apply the concepts it should improve grades tremendously. It is also a good review for parents in strategies that can help their younger children prepare for high school and college. One example of a strategy is to use graphing paper and a pencil when you do math problems. The graphing paper helps students to keep their work neat and orderly. The pencil is obvious! It is a good tool and well worth the time and investment.
3,Worth seeing for laughs!,"This is a pretty strange little film, running 77 minutes (the same as the old Paragon VHS release); the package shows 89 minutes. This low-budget obscurity is an amusing look back at 1969's styles: the clothing, hairstyles, and music (the rock band ""The Bored"" is pretty groovy). This was filmed in ""Violentvision"", whatever that is! It could refer to the psychedelic swirls that appear on screen whenever the overacting hero has one of his ""attacks"". Of course he's the obvious suspect in the murders that occur - he's constantly reminded that he'd been in an asylum for 13 years! His mother is also SERIOUSLY strange. The print quality is quite good, considering. There are some trailers for other masterpieces, including ""I Drink Your Blood"", and ""Horrors of the Black Museum""."
4,Great,Our baby likes it so much better than his Peg Perego high chair. He's closer to us at the table. We also tried the three-in-one clip and go seat but it was hard plastic and he wasn't comfortable in that either. He's much happier in the Tot-Lock and it's easy to get on and off the table and it's easy to clean.
3,Howard's developmental years,"It is apparent when reading many of the stories in this bookthat Robert E. Howard was still a developing writer. Some of them lackthe depth and complexity of his greater Conan tales. However, stories like ""Worms of the Earth,"" and ""The Dark Man"" make this book well worth the price of admission. I recommend it to any fan of Howard or of testosterone-infused fantasy stories."
4,wonderful,This is a funny show to watch loved it I definitely recommend it was a bit weird at times but overall still good
4,"Crisp,well paced thriller",This is a terrific psychological thriller.The author writes without cliches whilst showing a genius for detail.A good read with a clever plot. The narrative is laced with a unique wit and musing on the minor perplexities of life.Recommended!
5,A SUBLIME READ,"A taut psychological thriller that grips the reader from the very first page.Exhibits a unique blend of dark horror, quick wit and flawlessstorytelling.Highly recommended !"
5,A genuine page turner,The author combines a sharp wit and rich evocative prose with a sense of on-the-edge-of-your-seat pacing to create a thriller that is not just convincing but thought provoking as well.
4,great storytelling,"I really liked this book, it's one of my favorite in the genre of travel writing, with some very funny stories from the author's travels. I do wish he took more of a postive approach though, it seems nine out of ten stories show the negative side of travel, though I guess it's good to tell it like it is. Highly reccomended for a good laugh!"
5,Hilarious - and spot on!,"I loved this book. Elliott Hester's great writing style and self-deprecating humor make for a great travel read - it's mainly about the travel experience, far less so about the writer, and not at all about the writer's ego. Seasoned travelers will laugh and nod in agreement as they recall similar adventures of their own; armchair travelers will see ""the other side of the coin"" that's not usually highlighted on travel websites or in the Sunday Travel Section of your favorite paper. And if you read this book while you're on travels of your own, it's even more fun. Highly recommended."
1,What was I thinking,Don't spent money on this old junk! I should have read some better reviews. This is a true waste of time and money!
4,Stomach & Thighs [VHS],Arrived very fast and in great condition! I have absolutely no complaints and the price was very reasonable.Love it!The video itself played in great condition.
2,"Nikon manual, rewritten","I found very little information that isn't in the Nikon manual that comes with the camera. There are a number of factual errors scattered through the book. I was hoping for more hands-on advice on how to effectively use many of the more complicated features, and more detailed explanations of how the camera performs automatic functions. The book is padded with general photo advice not specific to the N80. This might be more helpful to a new photographer who doesn't have any other photography books."
3,Anthology is better,"I love this period of the Steve Miller Band, back when the band had blues and psychedelic flashes in their music. But I thought some of choices on this ""Best Of"" were a bit questionable. They give you 19 tracks, which is generous, but for me this doesn't really flow as a listening experience. Much better, in my opinion is the ""Anthology"" CD, which covers the same period of the Steve Miller Band, before ""Fly Like an Eagle"" and all that more poppy stuff. ""Anthology"" has fewer songs, only 16, than this collection, but each one is a stone cold classic. And that's not the case with a few of the choices on this collection. Not bad by any means, but I think they could have done a better job with both the song choices and the sequencing of the tracks."
5,Just right,"Product was shipped quickly and safely, arrived quite functional and just as advertised. Nice transaction."
3,Excessive Pilling,"While I found the size and fabric to be acceptable, there is still excessive pilling on the inside of the fleece even after repeated washings."
4,Battle Of Britain,I had to read this book for a book report and a powerpoint presentation. It was really easy to read and in between chapters there were lots of pictures and captions to bring it to life almost. I could not say that I enjoyed reading about such an awful event but the book made it easier for me to understand a lot better what it was all about.
3,Not nearly as good as the movie,"I expect any day now to hear one of our educated youngsters exclaim, ""Look, somebody named Shakespeare wrote a book about the movie ROMEO & JULIET."" STARMAN is one of the few books that are not as good as the film. Perhaps it is the terrific, ackward acting by Jeff Bridges or the semi-hysteria of Karen Allen as she slowly becomes aware of this alien. Regardless, it is a quick read and sorta smaltzy - nothing heavy but also nothing really deep."
4,Brings The Movie Back,Very closely parallels the movie. The book is an excellent rendition and does not detract from the movie. Even separate from the movie the author represents the theme of the movie very well. It is well worth the time to read even if you have seen the movie or not.
2,A tiresome soap opera plot set in the Dark Ages,"A confused and confusing tale involving many characters behaving oddly. The author does an adequate job of presenting the time period, even if there are some glaring errors (ie. a passing reference to the plaque two centuries before it hit Europe).I will not rehash the plot as several reviewers have already done that in detail. I found the story, and the ending in particular, worthy of a daytime soap opera. All that was lacking was an amnesiac.Try any one of these alternatives:PC Doherty (Hugh Corbett; 14th century England)Peter Tremayne (Sister Fidelma; 7th Century Ireland)Ellis Peters"
5,Superb,"I bought this album on vinyl the first week of release, and saw Jesse perform the album live in Eugene, Oregon about a week later. Musically, it is a logical progression from the jazzy tones of Ridgetop to the surreal sounds of the American Dream Suite. While I thought the arrangements of the individual licks on what was the original first side were truly excellent; it was the Dream suite that truly transported me. The orchestration was individual, and yet contained a restrained power that moved me. This album was stolen from my house the day of my wedding, in 1980, and I have looked for it ever since. I am happy to say, it still moves me. While I still love to dance the grizzly bear, and have moved higher in the gravel and chert; I wouldn't want to live without this album in my collection."
4,"Candy was fine, but...","My husband and I ordered these for a family member for christmas. Because they used to live in Germany, we thought it would be a fun little gift to send them. Although the candy itself was fine,the box that it come in was ripped and smashed.I guess I was just disappointed in the way it was packaged and mailed.It was put into a large envalope with no extra padding or anything.I mean, the point of the gift WAS the candy itself which was fine but it would have been nice if the original box had not been ruined.I had to throw away the box and find something else to put it in."
5,My daughter's favorite chocolate,"My sister in law sent these while she was in Germany. My daughter only wants this candy. She didn't even eat her halloween candy this year, just these. I'm so grateful that we can purchase them online."
5,Wonderful,"Lucille (La Lucila, Buenos Aires)An excellent piece of writing. Something that everyone who wants to be a better person should read."
1,Incorect advertising,"I reviewed this product earlier.See my earlier review for guidance. Neither the vendor nor Amazon took any positive action to forward the correct product to me, the purchaser. Repeatedly asking for reviews will not resolve the fundamental issue of incorrect advertising regarding the product's size. In the future I will not accept any further solicitation to review this product."
4,Joey Negro - All Star DJ,"The Cd is really good but takes a long time to get the beats going. One its in though the hard house and trance that Joey mixes is unbelievable. He is a good DJ and could easily rank uo there in the Judge Jules, Tall Paul scale. He can make your body move and great for partying."
2,Three bad movies,"These three movies have been beaufifully restored, but it doesn't change the fact that artistically they are bad. The acting is stiff, stagy. The writing is the same or worse.Waterloo Bridge, perhaps the best of the lot, feels like a stage play, which was what it was in a previous life. Mae Clarke is attractive as the lead, but the soldier who falls in love with her is wretched. We are asked to believe that he fell in love with a prostitute minutes after meeting her and proposed marriage, whereupon he introduced her to his upper class family. Bah!The other two movies, Red Headed Woman and Baby Face have even sillier plots and acting that is just as bad--or worse. The advertising of these movies would lead one to believe that they are racy, but the raciest scene in any of the three are the legs on the front of the case. The Hayes Office code didn't curtail the creativity of moviemakers, if these films are examples of Hollywood in its sinful era."
2,Should have remained forbidden,Not very interesting films selected simply because they fell under the approved subjects for their time.
4,"Great, but...","I have been looking forward to getting this set for a long time, and it arrived today. The movies themselves are all wonderful, and I have nothing bad to say about any of them. The first problem is small and that is that the discs are mislabeled. The one marked Disc Two with Barbara Stanwyck's picture on it is actually Disc One containing the other two films, and vice versa. The other complaint is that there are absolutely NO extras. These are all very short films, and there would have been plenty of room for something, anything. I was hoping for some commentary. Couldn't they at least have found some shorts to throw in?"
2,For pre code nostalgia only.,"Baby Face:Its not often you get a movie that uses Nietzsche as a pretext for the plot (2 stars just for that). Barbara Stanwyck is sleazy and cool (as well as gorgeous as usual). Not a great movie, maybe not even good (cause everyone's naivety her improbable fortuitousness) but something worth watching out of perverse curiosity.Red-Headed Woman:First , since it existed (tho expense) they could of used Technicolor for this flick, why make a movie about a read head if its black and white? Pointless, which shows how highly they thought of the prospect of this move making any money or perhaps being any good. The move got old pretty quick, its also annoying. Finally I don't think Jean Harlow is attractive or sexy, not even in a slutty way.Waterloo Bridge:The 1940 remake is rated as being much better than this, the original version. Should be because I couldn't get past first 30 minutes of this one."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 1940 VERSION OF WATERLOO BRIDGE????,How come the far superior 1940 version of Waterloo Bridge starring Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor isn't being released too?
4,love it,"This is a very pretty pair, although I ordered a half size smaller. It's quite comfortable. but after wear if for some hours, your sole will hurt a little cause the bottom is not very thick."
3,Beautiful but deadly,"This shoe is absolutely beautiful... if only it wasn't so badly designed in the balance aspect I would have totally kept it. THe problem was that it hurt my feet after a short while, and I couldn't really walk with confidence in fear of tripping...Just a tip: To test if a shoe is going to hurt your feet, put the shoe on a flat surface, and kind of push it lightly a couple times with your finger. If it seems very wobbly, or if it topples over, then the shoe is badly designed for balance.This shoe fails that test so... but maybe some people will feel differently."
5,Cute and Comfy!,Loved the shoes! They were really cute and believe it or not they were comfy too!The only thing I would suggest to any other buyers is that you get insoles just in case your feet become a bit- ahem- sweaty. The patent leather can make your feet feel a bit slippery if they are damp.All in all they were great!
5,Rhino,"Amazing! I love having these things at our summer camp. Everyday all the kids want to do is play dodgeball. As long as they don't squeeze them which detaches the skin from the foam, they will last a long time."
5,To Know Him: Beyond Religion Waits a Relationship That Will Change Your Life,It's an amazing book with so much info. about God's Word. Gloria Copeland helps make the Word of God so easy to understand. It is so freeing.
5,A MUST READ IF YOU DESIRE IS TO KNOW GOD,THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK IF YOUR DESIRE IS TO REALLY KNOW GOD. IT WAS EVERYTHING I WAS LOOKING FOR. GLORIA IS A GOOD AUTHOR AND TEACHER. I LIKE HER PRACTICAL WAY OF PRESENTING TRUTHS ABOUT GOD USING HER LIVE AS AN EXAMPLE. YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE.
2,Glad its over,"Does Kay Scarpetta not age? In Postmortem she was in her mid-forties, yet 18 years later in The Last Precinct she is ""not yet fifty"". I don't get it, or how huge errors like this get past an editor. Anyway it bothered me throughout this book (as did the whole plot). I hope this is the last book in the series, either way, its the last for me."
3,Fountain of Youth?,"How is it that during the course of all 11 of the books in this series, the niece Lucy has aged 19 years and Scarpetta about 5 years? Just wondering :)"
2,CORNWELLS NOT THE SAME ANY MORE!!!!!!,"This book picks up where Cornwells last one left off. I really not not like much of the book. The first many, many pages were very boring, talk, talk, talk. The middle was pretty good, then the ending was bad again. I could not believe just as Scarpetta was about to be done in the action stops and the next page says. ""Two weeks later!"" Bad ending Patricia. I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta books, I may not read another one. I really like Marino, Lucy I can do without, but I have come to feel like I am part of this group of people. Sad to leave them. I nearly put this one down before I finished it and that is rare for me. I know Patricia Cornwell can and has done better. ..."
3,Black Notice Two,"If Ms. Cornwell wasn't satisfied with Black Notice, she might have re-written it BEFORE it was published... because that's basically what The Last Precinct is: a re-telling of the previous tale. And some of the ""ah-ha"" insertions were less than believable. While I still enjoy her writing style, Cornwell greatly frustrated this devoted reader with a rambling back and forth plotless plot and re-hashed details from the last two books. And because of it's awkwardness, I could see the end coming from a mile away, which is something I count on Cornwell not to do. C'mon Patricia, hatch some new ideas and let Kay get ON with it!"
2,Contrived,"Poor Kay Scarpetta, she is viciously attacked in her home by a homicidal werewolf, and somehow she gets blamed for the death of another victim Diane Bray, the lesbian top cop who had crusaded to get Kay. This book might be better titled Black Notice Part 2.The plot is convoluted and contrived. Its actual resolution turns on the assumption that you can become an ATF agent, without undergoing a background check, and that Lucy wears body armor.Other meaningless plot devices include a large breasted New York special prosecutor who has Kay recreate the Bray murder all the while she is engaged to bring Kay before a special grand jury. Kay's friend Anna, the psychiatrist is revealed to have not one but two secret pasts-her father hosted SS troops in their Austrian castle within site of a death camp, but her entire family were really Jewish!Of course it all comes out well in the end, justice prevails and the bad guys are on the run - all the better for Black Notice Part III"
3,"Kay, Kay, Kay, ad infinitum","The writing is good....no question about Ms Cornwell's gift for words, but her main character is so self-indulgent. so full of rage, do prideful of her ""space"",so absorbed in her power that the reader becomes super-saturated with Kay! The last few Scarpetta books have leaned this way so I wonder if Ms Cornwell has written herself into the story. If so, I dislike her as well as her main character. I would suggest that she toss out Bently, Lucy, and especially, Marino, in any future stories. How about some just plain likeable characters?"
1,Not Her Worst- But Bad Enough,"I wish I knew what was going on. I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan from the begining and I have read them all. This is another unmitigated dud. Not as bad as Southern Cross, but close. Kay Scarpetta wallows in self-pity in this one, and by the mid-point of the book I have lost all interest in her as a character. The plot is terrible and not very believable, the writing is stilted, and the whole thing is a poor imitation of her earlier works. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Not a Scarpetta book,I have been a big fan of Cornwell and Scarpetta. This book was a big disappointment. I prefer a murder mystery. The story was focusing on Scarpetta's damaged psyche.
2,To long and drawn out with no real surprises,"I am one of Patsy Cornwell's biggest and longest fans. I have her personal autograph setting on my desk. So it is with regret that I say this is probably her worst work to date. For some reason she has decided to use an over abundence of words to tell a very predicatable story. Almost to the point you can guess what you are going to read on the pages before you turn them. She has added caracters that really have no relevance to the story or maybe I should say they would certainly not have been missed. Also leaving no question where the next book will start and who it will include. I also think she made a really big effort to include Lucy's sexual preference more often than necessary. I have absolutly no problem with homosexuality, but it seems as though she has made it one of the major themes of this story. Nevertheless, having said all this I would never miss one of her books!"
2,Last Precinct Lays an Egg,"Loyal fans of Cornwell will be sadly disappointed in this first person introspective that reeks of psycho-babble. One is not sure what Cornwell is trying to prove, but it is certainly an abysmal failure. Recommendation is to NOT read this book near an open flame as the temptation to toss it in would be too great. Let's hope Cornwell comes to her senses when writing the next book of this series --------"
4,A new side to Scarpetta,"We get to see a new side to Scarpetta in TLP. We get to see the HUMAN side of her. What person, even fictional (Scarpetta), can go on, day after day, without changing, once a loved one (Benton) has died? Scarpetta is changing.. for the better? For the worse? Who's to say because this story is not over. I found the changes in realistic, and the emotional side/factor of the character gave her more depth than she's ever had before.Cornwell's books are always complex, this book seemed moreso.. perhaps because it backtracked so much into the previous book Black Notice. I've always told friends that Cornwells' books are stand alones.. where you don't need to read them in order. But if you're reading TLP, you really need to read Black Notice first, otherwise it won't make any sense to you.I give this one a 4 stars, and do wait for the story to continue in the next book."
1,Last Precinct is the last straw for me...,"After reading the Kay Scarpetta series over the years I've finally decided I've had enough. The last good book in the series was ""From Potter's Field"". Anything since then has been junk. Everytime I buy one of Cornwell's new books I hope that her writing and imagination will be as good as she was in her early days, but she has lost it. The Last Precinct is basically her feelings on lesbianism, not homosexuality, but lesbianism. She's really trying to push the issue with her readers, and that is not why I read her novels. I suppose Kay Scarpetta will come out of the closet soon. No thanks....There are plenty of other good authors out there to choose from, although I will miss the old Kay Scarpetta. The Last Precinct was the last straw for me."
2,Blah...,"This is the worse book in the Kay Scarpetta series. The story was predictable. I was disappointed after reading the book. I hope the next book will have Cpt. Merino thin, smoke-free and not a heart attack in a pair of boots. I am sure her next Scarpetta will be better and not shrouded by such depression."
1,her worst yet,"I have read all of Patrica Cornwell's ""Scarpetta escapades"" and loved most of them. However, quite frankly this is the worst yet. I have felt since ""Point of Origin"" that the ending's seem rushed and not of the high standards set in Patrica Cornwell's previous books, ""Black Notice"" confirmed this to me and ""The Last Precinct"" just about takes the biscuit.Truly awful, Ms Cornwell (if you ever read this) If you are bored with Scarpetta, then end it..! but do somthing for your reputation sake."
1,Sad - just sad,"This took me forever to read - it was like a job. I feel it was so boring, just a bunch of whining, and complaining. PC goes on and on about Anna, we hardly hear about Lucy, or Marino- and supposdly TLP is Lucy's deal?!?! I just got through it hoping the next one is better. I have to say the last 3-4 chapters were very intense and exciting."
1,Big let down,"I am glad that I had read Patricia Cornwell's mysteries from the first one on through, if I had begun with ""The Last Precinct"" I don't believe I would ever have picked up another Cornwell mystery. I am going to give her another try with Trace, looking forward to seeing some of her old style of writing -keeping my fingers crossed!"
1,loopy loser,"What a muddled mess! Too many characters, subplots, introspection and confusion. Following the story line was pure torture and the ending was just thrown together. If I were a medical examiner, I would pronounce this book D.O.A. dead on arrival."
2,Suspense?,The Last Precinct by Patricia Cornwell is a suspense/fiction book. Cornwell writes with figurative language very creatively but I felt she often over used it. Certain subjects were very long and drawn out. There wasn't anything that kept me interested. I found it difficult to read this book because I just wasn't interested. I was expecting this to be a suspense book but she wrote more about the main character's self discovery than the actual murder situation. There was also nothing in the beginning of the book that caught my attention. I believe every good book should have a great attention getter and that is something Cornwell lacked. This is not a book I would reccommend.
2,The Last Precinct,"I am a great Patricia Cromwell fan. After reading this book, I think Kay needs a new job and maybe ""a life"". It looks like the author thinks so too since Kay is mulling over the need for a change.Kay needs some dimension, she's gone flat. How about a new permanet relationship, preferably with a man - and a little fun in her life!"
3,"If you don't want to know how the book ends, don't read this",I too have read all of Cornwell's novels and have loved themall. I preordered The Last Precinct and started reading the day itarrived. I enjoyed getting to know Dr. Scarpetta a little betterthrough her conversations with Anna. I think Cornwell spent a littletoo much time talking about Kay's sexuality and whether she wasattracted to various females we've read about in previous books. Ialso don't mind that it was more of a sequel than a stand-alone bookas Cornwell's novels have been.What I didn't like was the end....Maybe I missed something here.I hope Cornwell goes back to heroriginal style of writing with more action and suspense. Overall thiswas a good book. It just seemed to fall to pieces at the end.
2,Transition,"Let us hope that this installment in the Scarpetta saga is a transition. The character could be an enduring one, but I feel that Cornwell has used up the ME scene and maybe the Richmond scene as well; and as another reviewer has said, has painted herself into a corner. Cornwell has created some compelling characters and in the past has used the police procedural to give them effective voice. Perhaps the impending move to New York will reinvigorate the author and the character."
3,"Paranoia, thy name is Kay Scarpetta...","Patricia Cornwell could teach Chris Carter a thing or two about beasties who kill and the concommitent conspiracy which surrounds them. Some of the beasties border on the paranormal, some are more mundane. The initial pace is glacial, and it takes almost two-thirds of the book for the threads to start hanging together. We revisit (too) many old villians, old hurts, old lovers, and old conspiracies. The coincidences abound, and become downright annoying. To be fair, this is much much closer to the interesting and compulsively readable novels she started with, so read it, and get ready for her next..."
2,Not Worth The Wait,"I was anxiuosly awaiting the new release from Patricia Cornwell, having been a fan for years. I was, unfortunately, disapointed in ""The Last Precinct"", it lacks the action, suspense and mystery of her past novels. It's a direct follow up from her last novel, so if you want to be able to follow along, re read her last novel before you bother picking this one up. I was disappointed throughout the whole novel and let down at the end. I'll continue to be a fan of the Kay Scarpetta series, hoping the next one is better."
1,The last Cornwell.,"My husband and I just finished THE LAST PRECINCT. We have now read all of the Kay Scarpetta books, and probably won't read any more of them. Patricia Cornwell has a real gift for orchestrating grisly plots, but nothing more. Her main characters all sound alike: stilted and sullen. Kay Scarpetta has built her life to order, and all she does is whine. In fact, no one ever smiles or laughs in these books. They ooze the determined, self-obsessed misery of folks who have never truly suffered a day in their lives. We held some hope for THE LAST PRECINCT because of the blurbs: ""...takes readers deeper into Kay Scarpetta's heart and soul than ever before"" . . . ""'Where do you go when there is nowhere left?'"" Could it be that Scarpetta would finally undergo the epiphany she so badly needs, and be forced to work her way through the chip on her shoulder? Nope. These characters age but they never grow. And we're just too depressed to care any more."
2,Not Like They Used To Be,"I certainly miss the Kay Scarpetta of Cornwell's early books. Those writings were full of crime, excitement and great forensics. The last few novels, however, are about sexuality, ego and materialism...what a sell out."
4,Scarpetta's inside this time,Cornwell at her best you finally have a chance to see inside Kay Scarpetta not just her logical and brillant mind
1,A trip to the Dentist,"Reading this book was as painful as a trip to the dentist. By the time I had managed to work my way through the first 100 pages, I had come to the conclusion that for all concerned it would of been less painful if Chandonne had killed Scarpetta and ended this series that has gone downhill so fast. That being said, I probably will buy the next book just hoping that Patricia Cornwell can find the magic she had in earlier books in this series."
1,Simply a rehash,"The Last Precinct is simply a rehash of her previous book, Black Notice. The current plot centers on the serial killer in her last, but rather than continue with the plot it remains stagnant. Again a character is introduced within the last 60 pages or so of the book who could not be anticipated, thereby leaving the reader frustrated. The protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, is at her darkest and leaves the reader unsympathetic towards her even though the circumstances call for such."
2,Too much angst,"Dr. Scarpetta absolutely wallows in her misery. I find this tendency, which seems to increase with each book, to lessen the plot. I want to tell her to quit whining and get on with it!"
3,"A little confusing at times, but worth reading, for sure.","I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell and I live in Richmond, Virginia so I always get a kick out of reading her books because I know a lot of the places and roads that she mentions. That part didn't let me down. But..... this book was really hard to keep up with and unless you have a great memory you really need to go back and re-read Black Notice because it takes off right where that one left off. It was a good book, I enjoyed it, but some of it was a little bit far fetched and just too ironic to be believable. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I think you will know what I mean after reading it, and you should read it, because the ending is just another beginning for her next book and you can bet I will buy it the day it hits the streets."
3,I never expected the outcome to be what it was...,"Quite truthfully, after reading all the reviews here at Amazon.com I was expecting a horrible book. But, maybe it is because I just discovered Patricia Cornwell within the last year, so I had nothing to compare this book too.I had read Black Notice, and was very happy to see that The Last Precinct continued where it left off. What I was not expecting, however, was the twists and turns in the story line that I got with this book. On more than once occasion I thought I had solved the case, only to find my theories were complete hogwash.I was not disappointed in this book, and look forward to reading more of Ms Cornwell's novels."
5,Great book,I just finished reading this book and I thought it was great. I do not agree with the bad reviews. It was not a repeat of the other book it went on from there. It was very hard to put down and had a great ending. I love this author and have everyone of her great books.
3,STILL WAITING FOR THE NEXT ONE,"I eagerly anticipate Cornwell's novels and usually am more than overly excited to share with my friends the newest Kay Scarpetta novel, but The Last Precinct for me was a disappointment. The writing itself is up to Cornwell's usually 5 star work for me, but the story line, just left me wanting more of what wasn't there. Kay is a strong character, but she was so wishy-washy to me in this book. Trying to see her as vulnerable at times just came out as bland to me. Black Notice had a little bit of everything and I guess I just kept thinking of it considering the characters are carrying over."
1,no one can whine like patricia can,"Kinky Friedman has a song 'No one can pitch like Catfish can', I'm sure it would be easy to parody the words to fit this book. Patricia has reallly sunk low."
4,Refreshing!,"I just finished The Last Precinct a few hours ago! Patricia Cornwell has come through with yet another great Scarpetta novel. She tied up some loose ends and left us all craving more with her ending. I look forward to the future of Scarpetta, Marino, Lucy, Teun and Berger. Great job PC! Can't wait to read the next one!"
1,The Last Precinct,"This book is advertising copy--for those hundreds of products so skillfully named-- disguised as a novel! Boring rhetoric without depth, intrigue, mystery, much less excitement. I struggled to the end still expecting some unexpected twist. What a waste! Another great author has succumbed to mediocrity."
1,Kay and characters have lost their spark,"While I read and enjoyed Patrica Cronwell's other books, this one left me cold. Kay has become so paranoid and self-involved that her life is no longer interesting, nor or the characters that surround her. I couldn't bring myself to finish it -- I found it so bad -- and was sorry I bought it hard cover. It's my last Patricia Cronwell purchase."
2,Dino Bashing,"I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for many years. One of the things I always loved about her character, Kay Scarpetta, was her relationship with Dino. This new book, The Last Precinct, should be a last.... Where is the loving, loyal Kay? This one is mean, heartless and whines, whines, whines.....Poor Dino can do nothing to please her. His gruff demeanor, which was once written with such love, has become vendictive. Ms. Cornwell's lesbian lifestyle is well known, but when did she become a ""man-hater""? She disappoints all of her longtime fans with this book which portrays Dino as an olf, Lucy as a rich quitter and Kay as an unfocus wretch. Please Ms Cornwell, write a book which reflects the talent of your earlier works....."
2,I picked the wrong Cornwell book to start out with,"My mistake (or actually that of the person who recommended this book to me) is to have chosen THIS book to introduce myself to the writings of Patricia Cornwell.I found myself continually asking, ""When is the actual STORY going to begin?"" I never finished it, giving up as it went through one retrospective sweep after another.It's probably a great book if you're A) already a fan, and B) very familiar with the usual cast of characters in this series...I've not given up faith. I'll try another Cornwell book, but this time I'll put more thought into my choice."
4,Not the usual but an unusually good read,"I love Kay Scarpetta. She is the epitome of who most women strive to be: strong, empowered and independent. And this book did her more justice than any previously...Cornwell actually gave us some insight into Scarpetta's mind for a change. While I admit the plot was quite convoluted, it was a nice change of pace to get inside of Scarpetta to find out how everything in her life has effected her. I actually found myself more interested in her sessions with Anna at times than in the rest of the plot. Plus, I found the ending dissappointing how neatly it wrapped up. Lucy seems to be turning into a real superwoman, like her aunt. Though Cornwell seems to have written herself into a corner, I can't wait to see how she gets Scarpetta out of it."
3,"Good, but not as great as the rest","This novel was ok, helped to fill you in on the why and how, but spent too much time inside Kay's head. Also, because of this, she writes the novel in first person, which is different from all her previous novels, which makes it a little harder to read if you are used to reading Cornwell's other style. I think this book was okay, but not one of Cornwell's best."
2,O.K. But Too Much Whining and Moaning,"I have really enjoyed Cornwell's books, although recently she seems to have Scarpetta spend entirely too much time whining for herself and bemoaning Lucy. In ""The Last Precinct"" Scarpetta not only does this to excess - it was tiresome, especially for the first half - but also exhibiting personal weakness in contrast to the strength we have come to know. And Police Captain Marino is portrayed as an intolerant slob; one can wonder how he continues to hold his position. On a positive note, this book tied in nicely with the previous book, ""Black Notice"", which one should read first. All-in-all, I hope Cornwell gets off her downward spiral and soon will recover."
2,difficult to stay the course,While I am not an avid Dr. Scarpetta fan I have enjoyed some of her books. I found this to be a difficult read. I had read the prior story so was familiar with the protagonist. The time spent delving into Dr. Scarpetta's psyche was way too long. The energy spent in self analysis and paranoia was way too much for my taste.
2,Too Long,"I found this recent work by Patricia Cornwell tedious reading. I am found of her chief character Dr. Kay Scarpetta, but either Ms. Cornwell is losing her touch or I'm reading too much."
4,Cornwell Back Up to Par,"Hip-Hip-Hooray! Patricia Cornwell is definitely back up to snuff with her latest, The Last Precinct. From beginning to end I was totally engrossed. Wrapping up some unfinished business with finality and opening up new horizons for Kay Scarpetta made this an especially tantalizing treat. I look forward to what now lies in store for Kay, her niece, Lucy, and yes - even Marino. Will he retire??? Is Lucy involved with her former boss, Teun??? Stay tuned...only Patricia Cornwell knows."
3,"I love Kay Scarpetta, BUT..............","...is there no JOY is this poor woman's life??....and I am getting really tired of the bratty Lucy [actually who likes her BUT Kay]...and making Marino such pig[and most men]. Let's get to the point again where she is The Forensic Pathologist and solves murders that she is NOT the victim of, just because she is so smart....Kay gets more depressed in every book...and more out of control...and I like my hero/heroines to be somewhat in control of the scene.PATRICIA,PU-LEEZE SAVE KAY!!! However,I will continue to always read your books, because I fell in love with your writing long ago and I am hooked on you."
2,The Last Stand,"I was very disappointed with the ending of this book. There was so much build up to the story of the Loup Garou and all the people that may or may not be involved with Chardonne. I cannot believe she wrapped up the story in about 20 pages after building up the story for over 300 pages. There was so much more she could have done with the ending that when I put the book down, I had a very bitter taste in my mouth and felt very let down."
1,First Cornwell Novel Will Be My Last,"""The Last Precinct"" was, unfortunately, the first Cornwell book I have read--and will most likely be the last. This rambling, plotless narrative contains a [plot] so inane and preposterous that it makes the wilder Kennedy assassination ...theories seem highly plausable. Maybe all this would have been clearer had I read the previous Scarpetta editions--but somehow I doubt it. Perhaps Cornwell has used up the Scarpetta character and should consider jettisoning her for a fresher approach and set of characters. This novel is, at best, plodding and dull, with Cornwell's substantial knowledge of forensic techniques taking priority over an engaging plot."
2,Continuing decline,"This book appears to be yet the next installment of Cornwell's decline from the quality of her first novel. This disappointing book left far too many loose ends in its wrap-up, though the core story was not bad and was concluded appropriately. Each time I read another Cornwell novel, I swear it will be the last. This time I may take myself at my word."
3,The Last Precinct,"Not in keeping with Patricia Cornwell's usual succinct writing. Trying to keep up with the Kay's jumbled thought patterns was difficult and was a diversion from the plot of the book. She focused too much on jumping back and forth from one time period in Kay's very troubled life to another while trying to somehow weave the Chandonne storyline into these periods. Or could it be vice versa. I'm not sure. I lost track. Bringing Marino's emotions and feelings toward Kay into light was a nice touch. We needed to know that Pete was human instead of the gruff personality he usually bears. Overall, it was a good read. Not quite up to par with some of her other work, but a good read."
2,Skip it,"I couldn't put down the previous book, and this one is the exact opposite. It obsesses over everything that happened in the previous book without moving the character forward. Really, you could never read this book and not lose your place in the series. It is just like missing a few days of your favorite soap opera -- no harm done. Save yourself the money and wait for the next one, hopefully one with a new plot."
2,Cold chicken soup,"What a disappointment. Over the course of the Scarpetta novels we seem to have gone past exciting novelty, through comfortable predictability and become locked on a single case book after book. The raison d'etre for this book seems only to be to lay some kind of foundation for the next.... she looked into her top quality Italian stainless steel saucepan and saw the remains of last year's chicken soup. Some of the ingredients, which looked so tasty when she had bought them, appeared to be going bad in the pan. Maybe they had been bad on the inside all the time. She looked ... she stirred ... she added a couple of new vegetables but no matter how much she stirred ... it remained ... last year's chicken soup.I think KS is spending too much tme in the kitchen - she even seems to overlook obvious forensic evidence that could help the case which underpinned the novel."
2,fairly boring novel,"I have read all of the Cornwell as well, and can agree that this installment is not up to par at all. I'm not sure what went wrong. I think she tried to pull too many previous plots together, but it appeared strained, and yet she left other plots in the book dangling. I think she also meant this to be a more introspective edition - more of Scarpetta's thoughts and emotions. It comes off tedious and self absorbed. The entire middle 100 pages is way too slow, but if you're interested in police interrogation, you might find it interesting. I did not.I hope she gets back to some good action. If you're a fan, you'll probably want to read it to catch up on some tidbits, but if you've never read Cornwell, start with POstmortem, and NOT this one!"
2,STOP PLEASE!,"This book was a real burden to read. I have really enjoyed all of the other Scarpetta books even the Hornet's Nest etc, series. This was just, I don't know, boring. The plot, never found it really. Kept jumping around. One chapter it is all about her and Benton, then Lucy and her money, boss, whatever. Her job, did she quit, will she stay? Her therapy. She needs therapy. Should have dumped all this stuff in two or three chapters and maybe had Scarpetta moving to New York to start something new. Felt like this book satisfied some deadline to get a new book out and did not have any ideas!"
4,"Good, but not Cornwell's best","This is a direct continuation of BLACK NOTICE. Entire time period covered by both books is only about six weeks. After all the media hype about the relationship between LAST PRECINCT and the Jamestown Excavation, I was a bit dissapointed that the historical excavation played only a minor part in the story. Am already looking forward to the next book with Scarpetta in her new career and would enjoy another book in Cornwell's other series as well."
3,Classic Scarpetta,"I enjoy the books and look forward to continuing the story. It's now like reading about a friend.Wonderful ""Who done it"" reading for pleasure. Wow! What would Perry Mason have done withKay on his team?"
1,Terrible book,This book is something to be read in the toilet. Only slightly better than reading junk mail flyers from my local supermarket.
1,Boring and too detailed,"I found this book very difficult to read. It was hard to find the plot as it seemed to be bouncing all over. I was half way through it when it finally started to make some sense. Even though I have read many of her books in the past, I will probably not read another."
4,"better than black notice; pretty decent story, etc..","This adaptation of Patricia Cornwell's The Last Precinct, where one goes when justice can't be found elsewhere, wasn't too bad.Ms. Maxwell's Southern drawl fits right in with the Virginia setting. Dr. Scarpetta, the heroine of Ms. Cornwell's novels, is in the middle of being investigated. There's the search for a character (cutely named) ""the werewolf"". There's Ms. Scarpetta's devoted niece, a detective named Marino, and a host of other figures; helping to move the story along. This book is better (at least the audio version is) than Black Notice; which I couldn't get into. (I may try to reread it later.) Pretty decent story. [An aside-if you get to check out Ms. Cornwell on the ABC Primetime special with Ms. Diane Sawyer, investigating some real life homicides, check it out.]"
3,Black Notice rewritten?,"The good point to this story is that it ties up some of the questions raised previously in the series.If you haven't read The Black Notice, read it before this one. The entire story of that book is almost completely retold in this one. There are more subplots going on in this one than Cornwell has ever had before, but unfortunately the main plot is revolves around her previous book.The writing is typical Cornwell. If you like the rest of the series, you'll probabaly like this one, but I just couldn't get into it."
2,"1/4 good story, 3/4 hand wringing","Patricia Cornwell has stolen 3 days from my life of the 4 it took to wade through this book. A LOT of wasted words and frustrating hand wringing from Kay. I will no doubt give Cornwell one more try when this story is (hopefully) wrapped up and tossed in the furnace in her next Kay Scarpetta book. It is a poor sequel to ""Black Notice"" and a major disappointment."
2,What Happened?,"I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years, and wait IMPATIENTLY for each new book to come out. This one really let me down. The first third of the book was based on the story from the previous Kay Scarpetta book. It had been so long since I read it, though, that I had trouble following the storyline. Then, when it finally got to the new storyline the ending left me saying WHAT HAPPENED? I kept going back to see if there were pages missing from my copy."
3,black is back and still black,"it is probably unfair to reproach a medical examiner for being too grim and gory. after all, the reading of entrails is a bloody business. yet there are only so many shades of black and cornwell,a great storyteller, has just about plumbed them all in the scarpetta series. it is hoped that she explores other more varied hues of the human condition in future works."
2,Painful self analysis,"Kate Scarpetta is supposed to be one tough woman, not given to self analysis, self doubt or weakness of character. Too much time was spent dealing with the flaws in her character. I have read only one half of this book but I may finish it in the spring when my winter doldrums are over. Much too depressing to finish now with a new six inches of snow on the ground, grey skies, low temps, icy driveway and sick children."
2,Time for Patricia and Dr. Scarpetta to hang up lab coat.,"I started to read ""The Last Precinct"". For the life of me I could not get finish it, (hardly even started it). A friend told me to read ""Black Notice"" first, I might be able to read it then. I did. ""Black Notice"" was better. I was able to tolerate ""Precinct"". Dr. Scarpetta truly needs to see a shrink. Storyline ""flatlined"", making it as dead as her patients."
3,"The end of one story,beginning of another","At last! Resolution to Black Notice. For that I was grateful. This is another dark chapt. in Kay's life. Unlike many other reviewers, I enjoyed the introspection. I believe that it foreshadows great changes in Kay's life. If you care about this character, you'll care about this story. If you're a mystery/thriller purist, you may find it wanting. The end comes so quickly! (Too quickly.)"
1,Getting worse,Patricia Cornwell's earlier works are simply her best. That is how I got hooked. I eagerly awaited this one only to be bored with it from the start. She really needs to regroup and backup and write as I know she can. Too much Lucy and not enough ME stuff.I wanted so much to like this one and I was very disappointed.
4,Cornwell Throws a Curve,"I'll be the first to admit that it did take me a while to read this book. Its the first book in the series that is written in first person present tense, which made it extremely difficult for me to read. But once you get into the book its very good. Cornwell masterfully takes a very open plot and draws it all together for a wonderful ending. There are a few slow parts of character development and such, but it all comes together. Another one of Cornwell's finest."
2,what happened to the series?,"I can't finish it. About halfway through it and can't go on. The other books in the series had intrigue, fear, mystery, page-turning suspense but somehow all that was forgotten and left out in this book. Patricia Cornwell...what happened??? Before I buy the next book in the series I'll be checking it's reviews."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","I have loved the Kay Scarpetta series over the years - but with the last two novels I think it's time for Cornwell to head in a new direction. This series has evidently dried up. I was so disappointed in this book. If you have been a fan of the series everything in this book is old information - a certain amount of this is expected in a series - but this one was a waste of my money because ""I've heard it all before"". Kay, Lucy, and Marino have become very unpleasant people - there is no joy in their lives, even off the job. Doom and Gloom!"
2,What's Going On?,I'm sure I'm not the only one who's tired of Kay Scarpetta's angst and anguish at the expense of a real story. The distracting and stilted present tense of the prose could have been tolerated. But re-hashing her last book and the book before that? Maybe Ms. Cornwell has gotten bored. I know I have. The end of the book is an obvious harbinger of the next - because what little new plot there was didn't resolve. What a disappointing trend from a heretofore favorite author.
3,The seven degrees of Scarpetta,"This book is well paced and Cornwell brings back the suspense. I am an avid reader of Cornwell, or I guess I should say was. I only recently started reading her again. I was just bored with Cornwell's Scarpetta series after Black Notice, I mean a Werewolf!!!!, but this book is better, actually quite good. Of her last three novels this is the strongest and Trace the weakest, which is most regrettable sence it is her most recent. I do get tired of the seven degrees of Scarpetta, I mean is everyone she ever meets interconnected somehow, some of it is believeable, but much is just plain ridiculous. Having said that I still consider the Scarpetta series to be one of the best and encourage anyone who loves thrillers to read it from start to finish or at least to Point of Origin. If you are bored with Cornwell, try David Lindsey, now he IS the best."
1,Can't bring myself to finish it.,"Having read all of Cornwell's Kate novels, I started this one with the same enthusiasm, only to be disappointed. I just can't ""get into it"". So far it has lacked the appeal of her previous books. Who knows, maybe I'll get it another try, someday."
2,Mixed Feelings,"I had given up buying my own copies of Cornwall's books after years of waiting with bated breath for her books to come out. I now can wait for them from the library. The last couple of books, especially ""Black Notice"", left me flat and seriously considering not to read any more of this author's works. However, being 'faithful' to my authors, I did read ""The Last Precinct"" and enjoyed the fact that everything that seemed to be left 'dangling' in Black Notice seemed to be clarified. I read Last Precinct in a few days; however, I still feel that she is portraying her characters as being very shallow. Just when I think I am going to get ""into"" Marino or Lucy, Cornwall quickly pushes them out of my grasp. I'd like to see her go 'beyond' calling Marino on his cell, beyond 'hoping' Lucy will be there for her....get some ""umph"" in her writing. Frankly, it doesn't bother me that I won't see another Cornwall book for the next 2 years. Pity!"
2,Gloomier than ever,"Oh boy. Well, it's at least better than Point Of Origin or Black Notice. The writing's erratic, and Scarpetta herself is gloomier than ever, but the plot is kept fairly simple and is all the better for it. Lucy is still the Greatest Genius Woman Who Ever Lived -- one wonders if in the next book she'll run for president -- and if you haven't been following the Scarpetta books you won't understand a single word. Still, it's a page-turner, although I regret that the zippy prose and downright believability of Cornwell's first four books has seemingly vanished forever. She simply takes herself -- and Scarpetta, and Lucy -- far too seriously."
3,"Get off the cross, honey,......","Enough, already! Kay Scarpetta's determination to cram lesbianism and her torture of Dino has become a din. Where is the very excellent forensic work of the earlier books? The very thing that made Kay Scarpetta is buried beneath the flaming torches. The police work, the investigation, the mystrey-solving has been replaced by self-pity of gagging proportions...I was very disappointed....me a die-hard Patty Cornwell groupie! Bring back the earlier story lines. Who cares about how brilliant, rich, her niece is-who she sleeps with, whose butt she kicks (please!) Give me the old Kay anyday!..."
1,"Same song, umpteenth verse","Patricia Cornwell used to write really great books, but now she just keeps writing the same one over and over and over... Let's see, we have the betrayal by a co-worker (check), the latest trauma for Lucy (check), the deep angst and depression (check), the persecution by mysterious groups (check), the gruesome killer with a weird agenda (check), and so on. Honestly, the paranoia and self-pity are really getting boring. I keep reading the new ones hoping she'll go back to her old form, but I'm just about to give up. It's just too tedious!"
2,The Last Precinct,"Definitely not one of Cornwell's best. Too much concentration on Scarpetta's state of mind. I prefer the ""edge of the seat"" drama. This book didn't deliver."
3,Not Cornwell's Best,"Being a huge Patricia Cornwell fan I could not wait to get a copy of The Last Precinct in my hands. I only give the book 3 stars because it just does not pull the reader in like previous Cornwell novels. I hope Kay Scarpetta is only having a mid-life crisis. Don,t waste your money wait for the paperback."
2,Too much!,"A werewolf tries to kill her and she has to hide out with a friend who has a deep, dark secret and her niece is kicked out of the ATF and she's still in mourning for a murdered lover/colleague and she's investigating the death of a policewoman who was fiendishly plotting against her, but then she's accused of her murder. And there's a crooked prosecutor and the estranged son of her cop buddy who's lurking in New York with the Mob and the governor's wife is upset because some hate crimes might make the Jamestown colony look bad and then there's what happened to Mr. Peanut!This is the first book by this author I've read. It doesn't stand alone - there are so many characters thrown at you and bizarre plot twists that a first-time reader is overwhelmed. A novel this long should have a more definite resolution. You're given lots of details about characters, but not really introduced to them."
5,An Excellent Cornwell,"As a mystery author with my first book in its initial release, I have been an admirer of Patricia Cornwell for years. Kay Scarpetta is a marvelous creation, and in this novel, Kay struggles to resolve numerous unresolved issues. Her therapist puts it that way, as will the typical reader. THE LAST PRECINCT grows directly out of the events of Ms. Cornwell's most recent novels. This book has everything the Cornwell fan has grown to expect from Kay and the series. All the usual characters are on hand, even a certain deceased man, in a certain way. The plot twists and turns, and THE LAST PRECINCT is a winner."
1,I'm done with this series,"Although I have been a loyal reader of the series, The Last Precinct will be the last I read. I think I would still be a reader if Kay had saved Mr. Peanut! One moment that she thought of something outside herself and acted on it would have been enough to keep me as a reader. Instead, she is totally self-involved, whiny and the books are dark and depressing with no letup. People are not that one-dimensional and therefore the characters are becoming boring. And for heavens sake let up on Marino!!"
2,Quit complaining --- already!,"I have been an avid fan of Cornwell and enjoyed her books. Think I have missed only one which I had planned to find but now I am not so certain I will bother. Poor me, poor me, poor me is what I get from almost every page. As Barbara Bush would say ""Get over it""!And as Harry Truman said....""if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen"". I won't quote any other famous people but do think Patricia needs to take a vacation from all that is bothering HER as it is obvious it shows in her writing. I am only half way thru the book but that is only half the story. That is as far as I am going with this one!!!!"
2,Ditto,"I can only but agree with previous reviewers - I have quit reading this book and will think twice before picking up another Cornwell novel. Over the last few years, her characters have become people I do not wish to know. Their lives are too disturbing, too dark, too seedy. After reading ""The Last Precinct"" for a couple hours, I was in a depressed state and felt the need to take a shower. Her books are no longer entertaining and fun to read."
1,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS A -5, I WOULD!","I have been an avid reader for a minimum of 53 years. I found this book to be SO BORING, that I kept falling asleep whilst trying to read it. No surprises. No climaxes. I kept at it until the end, and was THRILLED TO KNOW I HAD FINISHED. Enough said."
1,Boring at Best,"Unlike the other books in the series, I found this book to be less interesting and boring at best. Nomally I fly through her books, this one took me almost a month to read through!"
2,It just didn't grab hold,"I found this book so tedious and such a departure from Ms. Cornwell's previous work that I was quite disappointed. The 1st person, present tense writing style has always driven me batty; it always feels like the story is being told AT you rather than told TO you. Some authors may believe that it's a more ""personal"" style of writing, but I think it's a poor attempt on the authors part to give the reader a deeper sense of being part of the characters life, when in reality it feels more like a cheap trick or a cop out.I would really like to see Ms. Cornwell branch out with these characters. How about a book where Kay is a supporting character but Lucy is the main character? That could be interesting, as long as she ditches the present tense writing style, and lets the characters get back to basics, with her normally strong, willful and energized women."
3,"More food, please!","hmm..well, I do love Patricia Cornwell, and I did scarf this book just as quickly as all of her previous efforts. However..I believe it lacked some of the fire of her preceeding novels. Don't get me wrong, I stand behind her work 110%, but I just feel as if there was something lacking. I love Scarpetta's house and the way she cooks..and the sheer effort she puts into a case...I felt that there was just too much of this novel spent in turmoil. Definitely a lit noir! At any rate, I enjoyed it, and I will continue to buy her novels, but this one left me slightly disappointed."
2,AVID FAN DISAPOINTED,"I was sooooooooooo anxiously awaiting the latest Cornwell novel, but unfortunately disapointed by the storyline ! It was confusing, flat and not a smooth storyline. I felt it lacked the mistery and surprising turn of events that Cornwell is so well known for. Hopefully I will make amends on the following novel, or else it would confirm that she has gotten to do this for fame and fortune and no longer out of passion like her novels prior to this one. Should you be a first time reader of Cornwell - start with the Body Farm or the Hornet's Nest to really see her shine !!!"
3,Frustrating!,"The story was filled with information, but never reached a resolution -- and this book should have brought a decisive conclusion for the questions that were brought up in Point of Origin and added to in Black Notice.The story was engrossing, but the copious rehash of the same clues and similar ones used in Black Notice, and the gratituous torture murders simply made it long. The story is still not wrapped up. Why were the murder / tortures even included?Whether the next book will resolve the crimes, criminals, and unearth significant details is the question. The serious problem is that I don't trust Patricia Cornwell to finish a story started in Point of Origin.Because I hoped for the conclusion, I kept reading, and her style did cature me. So that gives the book a few stars."
3,More of the same.,"This is just really more of the same..lots of extremely gruesome details from post mortems, and going over and rehashing old bits from past books featuring Dr.Kay Scarpetta and The Werewolf. It really got rather tedious towards the end, and as the book finished with The Werewolf and the two main baddies from this story, Jay Talley and Bev Kippen, alive and at large, the inference can only be that the author intends to drag out the story in more books..don't think I'll bother !"
1,Cornwell getting sloppy,"I generally like patricia cornwell's writting, but this story was just plain bad. In this book, she proves she can get gross, a way to avoid a skillful or clever story. I'll really hesitate before reading anything new she comes out with."
1,STINKS,"I am disappointed. I loved Patricia Cornwell's earlier books and was a big fan. I thought it was just getting off to a slow start and thought I should give The Last Precinct the benefit of the doubt. Well, by the time I made it through chapters 6 and 7, I just couldn't stomach any more of her ""Therapy"". Maybe it got better after that but I felt I couldn't waste more time to find out. To sum it up, I am glad I got it at the library instead of wasting my money. What happened, Patricia Cornwell?!?!?!"
4,Entertaining,"This is a continuation of the ""Black Notice"" story line. I hated ""Black Notice"", but found this sequel eminently more readable and entertaining. All of the main characters - Scarpetta, Lucy, and Marino - have added to their load of personal problems, and the capture of Chandonne has only exacerbated them. The suspense moves forward at an even pace as Scarpetta's job and freedom are on the line, and the plot is more believable than the prequel. Scarpetta remains a favorite character of mine, but she really needs to lighten up!"
2,A Serial Killer WIth Bad Breath,That is all I remember after finishing up 449 pages of neverending boredom. The plot does not seem to fit well. There are gaps everywhere. I am amazed I did not skip through the pages while Scarpetta whined about what seemed to be series of bad relationships. The only reason I am giving two stars instead of one is because I think Patricia Cornwell has her way with words. I am hoping for a better one - soon.
5,One of her best yet!,"This book is one of Patricia Cornwell's best yet! It does start out a bit slow, however it eventually picks up and takes the reader down an incredibly exciting path. The book provides us with a rare peek into the vulnerabilities and the tortured mind of Kay Scarpetta, could this is any way be a reflection into Patricia Cornwell's mind? Anyways, this book takes the reader in a new direction, one involving Kay Scarpetta(no more hints). You will have to buy it to read it to find out more-it is well worth it! I eagerly await the next installment to see where her life takes us next..."
2,Better that the last ones...but still boring.,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books, and since the last ones, i.e. Cause of Death, Point of Origin and Black Notice, were such a great disappointment (unlike the first ones), I think that, in a way, I enjoyed The Last Precinct. At least it did not make yawn in a wish to finish it, like her last ones. I agree with most of the readers, who say that Cornwell can and has done it much better. I do not know if I will buy the next Scarpetta novel, I think I have become tired of buying her next books in the hope that they will be better than the last ones. One last thing: why is Cornwell turning Marino into such an annoying character?"
2,Same story/book--different title,"I really enjoy reading a series of books from the same author--in fact I don't even mind the same 'type' of writing or story lines that murder mystery series novels most likely contain. BUT I do mind buying a book and feeling like I am reading the previous book in the series. The Last Precinct's story line is such a continuation of the previous book's werewolf theme and ""Is Benton really dead??"" storyline that I was bored and unchallenged while reading the majority of the book. The final chapters pick up a bit--and that is only b/c FINALLY some new material/characters come into the storyline.Patricia Cornwell can write much more interesting material--this must have been a very hard sell because as my title suggests--same story/book-different title!"
2,The Last Precinct,"Patricia Cornwell is an excellent writer, but each book in her series presents situations that are more macabre than the last. If you like mysteries that are reminiscent of film noir, then this book is for you. As far as I'm concerned -- The Last Precinct is my last book by this talented, imaginative author."
1,Last Princinct is Not Her Last Book,"Unfortunately, the 468 pages of this book were put there to give some space between Point of Origin and Patricia Cornwell's next book. This effort was boring and confusing. You may keep on reading in hopes that she will make sense of things, but you'll be disappointed. I re-read this book to learn what I had misssed, but it seemed even more jumbled the second time.Do yourself a favor and read all her early Scarpetta books, or at least Post Mortem and Cruel and Unusual, but stop before you crack the cover of Point of Origin. Avoicd this current book, The Last Princinct. There are so many delightful mystery-thrillers out there.[....]"
4,"Come on folks, give it a chance","I have to admit, I have been disappointed in the past two Scarpetta novels and actually held off buying Last Precinct until recently. However, after reading it (very quickly I might add), I see much of the old Patricia Cornwell resurfacing.I enjoyed the movement and the plot of the book as well as the twists that never cease to amaze me.I think that in an effort to please the reader, the author ""pumped out"" a few novels that we didn't find pleasing. In response to us she has produced this one and I feel that we are seeing the resurrection of a good heroine.So, I'm not giving up - I'm anxiously awaiting the next novel in the series."
2,"Boring, Long, Confusing & Depressing","I'm a huge fan of Kay Scarpetta but this book was just too much. It was constantly referring to Black Notice, the book prior to this, so much so that I felt as if I should have read the two back to back.It starts out slow and is (of course!) resolved in the final few pages. I think that Kay is getting to be one dimensional -- surely she has some sort of a life away from work? Everything revolves around her and everything is tied together. I know, I know, it's a novel about *HER* but it gets to be too much.If you've read all the others in this series, of course you'll have to read this one. But, I don't think it's up to standard tho I was left with a feeling of hope for future Kay Scarpetta novels!"
3,A contrived set up to the next book,"I love Kay Scarpetta. I have read all the books in the series, and was happy to finally get The Last Precinct. What a disappointment. This book spends a great deal of time rehashing the past two books and an unbearable amount of time on Kay talking everything over with her friends. There was a time when the focus of the books were criminals and solving the crimes via forensics. Lately it seems as Kay is always the victim, with somebody out to get her. After reading this book I was very let down. While the main 'mystery' of this book is solved, it all seem slapped on at the end, and very contrived. It seems as the whole point of the book was to set up the next book; which at this point, unless the reviews are great, I will probably skip."
2,Unreal,"For the first time in all of the books I've read of Ms. Cornwell this is the first that I could not only ""put down"", but halfway through I didn't care how it ended. Only that this tedious work of unbelievable fiction FINALLY did end. It was wordy and frequently redundant. An author of this caliber should concentrate on content and not the obviously payment per word."
2,Another disappointment,Patricia Cornwell's early books are loaded with gripping plots and unforgettable characters. Not so in her last 2 books with Last Precinct even less satisfying than Black Notice. Dr. Kay Scarpetta has become a whiny character with no dimension other than her job. I figured out the plot of this book at the end of Black Notice. She should have combined the two books into one. Borrow it don't buy it.
3,Maybe It's Time for a Break,"I hate to say it but, this book was about 150 pages too long. The ending seemed rushed and I felt that there were loose ends left intentionally dangling so the next book could 'prologue' another wistful memory section.Please Ms. Cornwell, we know the good doc's niece is lesbian (with a new lover for each book - or so it seems), she loves to cook Italian and suffers more angst than a real person ever did. Move on and get to the story.To her credit, Cornwell did a masterful job of weaving the tale after she stopped rehashing the past and telling us how to make Italian dishes.It might be time to read the reviews and/or wait for the paperback on the next one. I hate that."
2,Long winded and disappointing,"Since this is my first Patricia Cornwell, I feel that I need to go back and read books 1-3 before I make a full assesment of her writing. I found this book sometimes overly detailed and longwinded, almost like she was trying to fill a certain page number. I found some of the subplots of the characters unbelieveable if not underdeveloped. Although I did like Marino, who reminds me of NYPD Blue's Andy Sipowitz, his color came across in this work. I finished this book partially because i was on a long plane ride and partially because I thought something was going to happen. I would definately give this author another chance but I cannot recommend this book, especially if you are new to the author, you might not want to start with one of the first novels of Kay Scarpetta."
1,skipped to the end,"UGH... I am so disappointed in the last few PC novels and this one has been so terrible that I skipped to the end after the first 100 pages or so just to satisfy my curiosity about whodunnit (which is completely implausible and stupid, btw) without having to put up with the tedious story and Kay's insufferable attitude and paranoia. Oh, how I wish to have the wonderful read of All that Remains again!"
3,Better than expected,"The last 3 or 4 installments of this series have left me saying that I was not going to bother reading any more of them, but of course I do. This time I did not regret reading her work - it did tie up some loose ends from Black Notice and it was entertaining. It did not bother me that we were privy to some intimate conversations between KS and a therapist/friend, b/c it allowed me to get to know her better. At least this time we were not getting minute details of every meal that was cooked. I would like to see her throw Marino a bone and get off his back. Bottem line - if you like PC and any of her other works, you won't regret reading this book. It won't thrill you the way her earlier works did, but it won't bore you to tears."
1,11 is an unlucky number for the reader,"I was a big fan of Patricia Cornwell, until the last precinct. I know you are going to have to read it to continue the werewolf story line but read it fast so the pain doesn't linger.I think some authors lose it with their character development and this one is lost to fantasy. The plot line leads us closer to the middle earth than it does to Richmond and the ending appears to be forced like she hit the number of required pages.So I know you will have to read it....just be quick and get the pain over with and go on to another author."
2,Beating a dead horse (or a live werewolf?),"I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that in ""The Last Precinct,"" Patricia Cornwell drags in way too much of her previous novel, ""Black Notice""--the first hundred pages literally paraphrase what went on in BN. Unlike others, I've never found Dr. Kay Scarpetta to be a particularly sympathetic or even likable character. Cornwell tends to paint Scarpetta as the all-knowing and all-seeing wisewoman, with an insufferable attitude towards those she finds ""inferior"", most notably Pete Marino. The situation with her niece Lucy (oh, did you know that she's a lesbian? It's hard to ignore when Cornwell mentions that fact seemingly every time Lucy's name comes up) is getting to be a joke as well. Cornwell, as usual, is technically flawless in the forensic details, but inside Scarpetta's chilly, self-absorbed psyche is not a place where'd I'd want to hang out for very long."
4,This Book Needed to be Written!!,"Yes, it's true. It's not her best. It drags a bit. It's self-indulgent. It's a bit long. It retreads familiar territory. But, you know what, it needed to be written. We finally get inside Kay Scarpetta's head and maybe discover it's not necessarily a fun place to be. Many loose ends are dealt with in this novel , some as far back as Body of Evidence (Cornwell's second Scarpetta novel). My hope is that new life is breathed into the next book in the series. For fans of Virgina's Chief Medical Examiner, it's a book that cannot be missed. If you're not a fan, start with the first one, Postmortem, and make your way through the list (I did in a couple of months). You will not be disappointed."
2,A Transitional Work Best Left Unread...,"THE LAST PRECINCT is Patricia Cornwell's most disappointing outing to date. Badly shaken by her near fatal run-in with the Loup-Garou, the freakish werewolf-like Parisian serial killer from BLACK NOTICE, Dr. Kay Scarpetta's strong-will is beginning to show signs of stress fracture. Kay doubts her abilities, her job, her judgement, and wonders if she's still cut out or even wants to remain Virginia's chief medical examiner. The doubts seems to reside more in the author's mind than in the main character. Cornwell seems to be cracking under the pressure of this wildly popular (read lucrative) franchise. If you're new to the series, do yourself a favor, skip this one in favor of an earlier volume or wait for what develops in the series after this one. Clearly a transitional work that doesn't really begin to kick into gear until after the first third of the book and then only in fits and starts."
4,A prequel or a sequel?,"This book is totally absorbing...depending more on character analysis rather than plot advancing incidents. However, I was disappointed at the slap dash ending. After wading through 400 plus pages, I discovered we were really just being set up for the sequel. It's time for closure and for Kay to move on to a new case."
2,Dragged through to the end,"I think authors get to the point that cranking out the next book is more important than quality. This book spends too much time covering event history from her previous book, Black Notice, and too many pages on points that should be covered quicker. Did she have to have so much filler? You just wanted to tell her, ""get on with the story"". And at the end, too many issues were just left hanging. You want to say .... Wait a minute, what happened to whats his name and whats her name? This book is certainly not the disaster of her Hornet's Nest or Southern Cross. However, Ms. Cornwell has done better in other writing efforts. I can only hope she demonstrates more creativity in her next book."
3,Not her best!,After the death of her serial killers - Patricia has left much to be desired in her story line. Although I'm glad to see Kay is back in the books (I couldn't finish Hornets Nest or her next one) the excitement that existed in her earlier books is missing. I hope that her next one begins another long running story that will keep all of her faithful readers on the edge of their seats (again). Overall - I found this book hard to finish.
2,Disappointing,"Why did she bother writing Black Notice? It's practically re-written in this book. I want the old Kay back. The independent, self-assured, intelligent medical examiner. Not this whiny, irrational being. Sorry PC but I agree with other readers, you're too caught up on your popularity, trying to fulfill book writing obligations and losing creativity and you're too hook on your own AC/DC persona."
4,The ultimate suspence but the ending... ever so disappointing...,"It seems to me that everything possible has been said about this book. I do want to add something which is this: It took me quite some persistance to get through the beginning (e.i. the first 1/3 part) of the book but I was determined, and just knew it had to get better SOMEWHERE. It did. The middle part truly was one of the best suspence ever. But I got a strong feeling that the whole story would go out like a night candle and lo and behold, it did.And that was the biggest disappointment EVER. There, I've said it."
5,Works great,"I had to replace the crank arm on my Diamondback bike. I looked at other crank arms being in the $20 - $30 price range when I found this crank arm. Great replacement part, excellent price."
3,"Good overall, but some unanswered questions","This is probably the best book out there on Earl Warren, covering his life in politics and at the Supreme Court. Ed Cray does a good job explaining the roots of Warren's political beliefs and how he used his political background to exert such a strong influence on the Supreme Court.Unfortunately, Ed Cray doesn't follow up on at least two issues: Warren's friendships with J. Edgar Hoover and William Knowland. According to the book, when Warren was in California state government he became such good friends with J. Edgar Hoover that he called Hoover ""Jay""- yet it seems hard to imagine that Warren's friendship with Hoover survived some of his court decisions. Perhaps it did, but Cray doesn't address the issue. Similarly, it seems that Warren's liberal court decisions would have impacted his friendship with conservative Senator William Knowland, but the book doesn't talk about this, either."
5,This is the only book that tells it like it is in business,"Finally someone has spoken about ""the elephant in the room."" This book frankly and intelligently talks about the true measures of success in business and how, with integrity, to have the ultimate influence. The book has changed my life in terms of my attitudes and actions in the business world. I love the pracitcal and real life examples. A must read for anyone in the work world!"
2,Unfortunately unconvincing and without clear action steps.,"Initially interesting, this book ends up being discouraging. It starts out with some solid concepts about corporate politics and integrity - but overall it does not deliver on those claims.Not only is it unconvincing about its core premise - that you CAN ""play"" politics with high integrity - but it gives only general ideas and concepts with no clear action steps for the reader to try out.I'm a firm believer in the reality of high-integrity politics, and so I had great hopes for this being a book I could recommend to my clients. Sadly, I think it makes much more of a case for politics being ugly and unfortunate than high-integrity and - yes - fun!There are many others that are much better. This one is very skippable."
5,A Book for The Ages! Excellent for Anyone Who Works With Other People,"Simply stated, this is an important book that tackles a taboo subject. Each chapter offers new insights and case studies, and, best of all, step-by-step tactics. I encourage all my MBA and Executive MBA students to read it, and it is encouraging to see so many positive responses.But this book is essential reading for more than just individuals in the business world. Politics rears its head anytime two or more gather to accomplish anything. I can imagine churches and non-profits will find Brandon and Seldman's high integrity approach to organizational politics extremely useful as well."
4,Impressive Guitar playing!,I am very impressed with this this young guitar player! In addition to being my kind of music this is a band that only will mature. I can't wait cause they are hot now!
2,"Product Not as described from Light Bulbs Etc, Inc.","I ordered this lamp from Light Bulbs Etc, Inc. What I received was not what is listed. I receivedBulbrite Halogen BR-30 Flood,Item#: 694075,Ordering code: H75BR30FLHalogen burns ""white"" and Incandescent burns ""orange-yellow"". If you order from Light Bulbs Etc. you may get what I got so be prepared to replace all you incandescent lights to halogen so that you don't have two different color lights in the same room."
2,Excellent but obsolete,"This is a terrific book for those learning logic and formal proof techniques, the prerequisites to advanced study in mathematics, but it's out of date (to the extent that a math book can be): A much-improved second edition came out in 2006, under the titleDoing Mathematics: An Introduction to Proofs and Problem-Solving. I highly recommend it."
3,I wish the cuttlefish had done the editing too.,"I love those cuttlefish, but there's something about the cheesy editing techniques that cheapen this entire episode. Why do I need to see the cuttlefish researchers walking in speeded up motion through the halls to their offices? Why do I need to hear a throbbing synthesizer whenever the cuttlefish puts on it's predatory light show? The cuttlefish is an amazing creature, and it doesn't need any assistance from human post-production people to hold my attention. I watched this once, but probably never again."
2,Streetwise Italian,"In questo testo molte delle idee, degli esempi proposti e molti degli ""idioms"" sono ottimi e riportati in maniera eccellente.Purtroppo pero' in vari capitoli ci sono troppi errori di grammatica ed espressioni che non ho mai sentito usare prima.Trattandosi di ""Italian slang"" e' naturale aspettarsi espressioni che si discostino dall'Italiano grammaticalmente corretto e data la diversita' di dialetti parlati in Italia e' normale scoprire a volte nuovi modi di dire.Tuttavia, in molti degli esempi riportati nel testo, l'espressione Italiana (quella che per lo meno io avrei usato) si discosta spesso e di molto da quella proposta nel testo, che in aggiunta presenta errori grammaticali. Per questo motivo ritengo che il contenuto di alcuni capitoli richieda un'attenta revisione."
1,POOR Battery Life,"I agree with the others. The battery life is not acceptable.I've owned it for a year. I- Average use was once / week- Suction was great (at first)- Attatchments were great.- Easy storage.If not for the battery life, this is a wonderful product."
2,"OK, BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY",I ACTUALLY RETURNED THIS ITEM AFTER I USED IT ONLY ONCE. OUT OF THE BOX (AFTER THE FIRST CHARGE) IT DID NOT WORK. I TOOK THE BATTERY COVER OFF AND FOUND THAT ONE OF THE LEADS WAS DISCONNECTED. ONCE I GOT PAST THAT ISSUE I BEGAN USING IT IN OUR KITCHEN. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES THE POWER BEGAN TO DIMINISH. AT FULL CHARGE IT PICKED UP DIRT VERY WELL BUT THE POORLY DESIGNED EXTENSION TUBES KEPT COMING APART. BASICALLY THIS VACUUM NOT AT ALL WHAT I HAD EXPECTED.
1,Poor battery life; model confusion,"Like the other reviewers, I too, have battery problems. The battery discharges even when the unit is off if it is off the charger for a few hours. And even when fully charged it doesn't last long. But to make things worse the charger sucks power: it will consume about 70KwH per year just to sit there! Depending upon you electricity rates that's about $14/year in idle power! Add to that $26 for a new battery a few times a year and you have no bargain. Also, there appears to be several different models all using the same model numbers: there is a 14.4volt, 15.6 vold and 18 volt versions -- all called EP750M."
1,It Doesn't Suck,"I've had this unit for some time now and I liked it though my wife found it too heavy. Then I put it away for a few months and when I tried it recently, the battery wouldn't recharge. The unit is dead. So I got on Amazon.com and read the reviews to see what could be done. I found that everyone seems to have battery problems. I'm junking this Shark and switching to a Dustbuster."
1,Dosn't suck for long,"I wish I had read the reviews first,would've saved 60 bucks.Only after a few uses the battery does not hold up for long.This vac is worse than a piece of junk.A piece of junk might'velasted longer.All the reviews about the crappy battery life is true.How this company is in business is a miracle.John O'Hara"
2,not worth the money,"I bought this hand vac from Bed and bath because of it's portability and suction power. The first time I used it, it was great, but after a month for so it's now pretty much useless.reason why I think it's a rip off:- it takes a long time to recharge.- it's bulky and hard to remove from the base, it gets stuck a lot.- the dirt actually FALLS BACK OUT! The little rubber flap that keeps the dirt in is now deformed (in just 3 months!)so the dirt just falls back out.- the motor is not very powerful. There are times when I remove the attachement and find dirt still stuck in the attachment.- Very messy to dump the dirt out. It's just a filter and I have to use my hands to prie the dirt off the filter. And the dust just usually get every where when I try to dump it out in the trash can.I am really bummed out by this hand vac. It looked great and seemed great, but I wish I spent that money on a real vac."
4,dirt eater,"I think they're on to a good idea here. When fully charged (it takes about 3 full chargings/uses of the vacuum) it sucks up stuff very well...my biggest complaint is that the dustcup is so tiny, it fills up extremely fast.This really is ideal, living in a small apartment, but i can see where it would get annoying living in a larger house with more heavy-duty vacuuming; as the extension tube do tend to fall out of the vacuum (there really should be a locking mechanism that keeps them in place. and i'm willing to bet there will be on the next incarnation of this product.)it is slightly pricey for what you get, so i would reccomend wating for it to go on sale, but really, if you're in small quarters, or you just need a reliable hand held cordless vac, it's a work horse."
1,Product OK/ServiceNOK,"After the battery gave out, I ordered another. First promise:7 days; second: 21 days; third: 3 to 4 weeks."
2,An Excellent Product That I Can't Use,"Just to agree with the other 95% of the reviewers, the battery life is horrible. Which in my opinion is the most important aspect of anything cordless. If you only need to pick up crumbs for the next 3 months, this is the product for you. It does an excellent job. However, after 3 months, my children are still making crumbs, and I am forced to purchase another cordless vacuum. Therefore, I just wasted 60 bucks. I have actually resorted to using a broom and dustpan. But as we all know, that's for June Clever's generation. Hence, I will have to spend another 50 bucks on a Dirt Devil or something."
3,Lightweight,"This product is easy to manage and carry around. It works well on hard floors, not so well on carpet. The extra attachments make it convenient to stand upright while using it. However, the attachments tend to fall out easily as there is no mechanism to keep it inserted in the vac."
1,How to give cordless tools a bad name,"We have had this Shark (perhaps appropriately named for feeding on fleeced customers) for a year or less. During this time the machine has been used for light household duties which have not demanded a lot from it. Initially it held its charge for a reasonable amount of time but quickly this changed to the point where it does not last a full two minutes, even though it is kept ""fully charged"" in its stand. We bought this to replace an old Black and Decker ""dustbuster"" (one of the original ones produced) which still worked when we replaced it. Where has craftsmanship gone?"
2,Poor battery life,"This product worked great at first. Then it would only last for a minute or two. Then it stopped working all together. I had it for a year, maybe little less."
1,This thing is a piece of junk. Don't buy it.,Right out of the box it's had problems. Fist they just throw all the parts in a plastic bag and then dump it in some peanuts. This one looked as if it had been used. The battery was giving out after a couple of seconds. I have a shark steam cleaner that is great but this looks like it was made by a group of 3 year olds.
1,Wish I'd read these reviews,This is an expensive item (we paid $79 for the wet/dry version) for it not to even last for two years - hardly used. Our vac also only operates for about 10 secs now before dying. Why get a rechargable if you can't keep it on the charger (especially when the manual says to do so at all times)? The battery is horrible. This company should not be supported.
2,Shark battery life poor,"The device worked for a few months. We gave it only light duty. Quickly, the battery life fell drastically. The unit would run for about 3 minutes, then die suddenly -- not a gradual battery wearout as is common. Turning the unit off and on would bring it back for only a short time. Now, it runs for 3 or 4 seconds before it quits. Turning it off/on lets it run another few seconds before it dies again.What's happening appears electronic in nature, that is that when the unit senses low power it just turns off. I don't think it's the batteries. Instead, my guess is there is a faulty ""mother board"" regulating the charging system. If it is happening to my unit and the several others I see posted here, betcha it is a common problem for hundreds. If I can contact the mfr and gete some insight I will come back to update here."
1,Battery Life Miserable,"Like a few other customers, I too found the battery to have an extremely short life...I would NEVER buy this product again. Much better deals out there for quick cleanups."
1,Battery is the Problem,Same as the other reviews. I got this thing mainly to clean out the cars. After six months it won't run long enough to be of any use what-so-ever. Wish I had read these reviews *before* buying this piece of junk.The only reason I rated it one-star is because I don't know how to rate it zero or less.Don't waste your money.
1,Disapointment - Battery Blues,"Vacuum was great on the first charge, then each consecutive charge the memory effect took over on the battery. Don't buy a vacuum with NiCd batteries; stick with NiMh. Like everyone else, shark vac no longer works because of battery."
1,Do not buy!!!!!,"I bought this model Shark handheld vacuum and have never gotten good use out of it. It has been fully charged and used to pick up a teaspoon of sugar, which it didn't do, and I have tried to use it to pick up sand off my area carpets. It doesn't. This has been a waste of my money! It is truly a horrible feeling to have to throw away a brand new vac into the trash and know you have been ripped off....D.A. in Biloxi, MS"
1,Battery problems,"I, too, loved this product when I first bought it but I'm having the same problem as others. After using it for a few months, I noticed that it didn't seem to have as much power as when it was new. Now it barely works at all. No matter how long it's charged, it only runs for a few seconds and then quits. Definitely would not purchase again."
1,Awful,"I was so excited to get this shark vac because of its advertised power. I am so disappointed! The battery life is so short, I can't use it more than 2 minutes and I've had it less than 1 yr. It is somewhat useless considering you can only vaccuum one sm area before it needs to be re-charged, don't waste your money!"
2,Works great for about 6 months,"Loved this thing when I first got it... Unfortunately, the battery totally dies after just 10-20 seconds now... don't get this product unless you only need it for a few months!"
1,Shark cordless has no staying power,I was relieved to read that everyone else had the same experience I have with the Shark handheld. I too had the Dustbuster Plus for years and loved it. Then I went to get a replacement and thought I did my homework...The Shark was fine at first but quickly lost its power and wouldn't recharge. I finally tossed it and just started using my upright's hose which works okay but the Shark was very disappointing.
2,Not worth the money.....,"Although the Shark Deluxe has great suction, it only runs for about 5 minutes before the battery dies.Great suction means very little if the unit won't run long enough to clean a staircase.Save your money."
1,Not a happy camper,"Replaced a 7 yr old Dustbuster with this unit , as stated by others after several months (7-10) , the battery would only hold a 1 minute charge then died , tried to order a replacement battery in Feb still on BO till at least May 20 . Cancelled the order today and will be getting a New Dustbuster soon .Battery Life and Customer service is the Pit's ."
2,Choose another one,I am giving this two stars because I was happy with the vacuum initially. The only problem I had in the beginning was that the flimsy extension handle that turns it into an upright kept detaching from the vacuum. I would find myself holding the handle while the vacuum shot across the room without me. Now I am having the same problem as most of the reviewers. IT WILL NOT HOLD A CHARGE. My friend and my mom have both had the same compaints. I am back to the old stand by: a broom and dustpan.
1,"sucks, sucks, sucks! but unfortunately, not dirt.","this vacuum was the biggest waste of money. we have had it for a year and it worked for maybe 4 months and over the past 8 months, it has not worked at all, even in small areas. the battery life seems to be the culprit, since when we charge the vaccum, it will work for a second and shut off. we will NEVER buy shark again--we're looking at dirt devil for our next purchase."
1,Worst customer service I have ever seen!,"This vacuum was wonderful for about a week. It started with the attachments just falling apart. No matter how you try to put them together, they separate as you vacuum. Then it lost suction no matter how clean the cup was! Then the battery wouldn't hold a charge. Now it is completely dead! I never get ANY response to my emails at all! I will never purchase another EuroPro product again!Buyer Beware!!!"
2,"Off to a Good Start, but Battery Fails Quickly","If this review were based on the first week, it would have gotten 5 stars. The noise is not too bad. Of course the Shark is somewhat loud. This is the nature of vacuums, especially small hand held units. Fortunately, it does not have the high pitched whine of the one it was replacing, which used to drive me bonkers. And it was quite powerful, with quite an admirable sucking power. Moreover, the overall unit design is pretty funky looking. Unfortunately, the battery did not last long between charges. And what is much worse, its performance rapidly degraded, so that a year later, it barely holds a charge good for a few seconds of vacuuming. If this unit had been used daily, you might expect such a loss of battery power. This was not the case as it was used only once a week or so. Because of this, and there is no easy way to get a replacement battery, I would recommend to avoid this vacuum until they improve battery performance."
2,Happy for a few months,"I loved this cordless vacuum when I got it, and would still love it IF it held a charge. The battery only lasted about 6 months before it started to lose power. Now, it only works for a few minutes. The worst part is that I can't get any help from the company. After several emails, someone called to say they would send me another battery (I even offered to pay for it). That was 2 months ago! Now, I can't get anyone to respond to my emails. When I call, I get put on hold forever. I would not recommend this product or any other by this company."
1,Battery Pack will not hold charge,"I purchased this item back in February of this year and it worked fine for 90 days, until the warranty ran out. We used it to vacuum the cars and everything, it really has strong suction. Now, however, the battery pack will not hold a charge for more than one minute. I called the company and they stated they will send another in five to six weeks, meanwhile I cannot use the vacuum. Donna"
1,Not for long term,"I've bought this twice - now I'm looking at a Black & Decker. It works fine to start, but the recharge unit dies in less than a year. I don't use it on a daily basis, but when I need it, I expect it to run. It doesn't anymore. Not worth the money for long term."
3,"Good, but could be much better.","The Euro-Pro does have a lot more power than similar items. It picks up debris quite well. The attachments are nice and it is convenient that they are stored on the charger unit. On the down side, the charge runs out rather quickly, and it is a bit difficult to get in and out of the charger. The dust cup is easy to spill when removed - and replacement filters were impossible to find locally. Dog hair will clog the intake quickly - a real problem in our household."
1,Don't even think about buying this piece of junk!,"It worked once. Yes, I said once. What a piece of junk!"
2,Not worth the price,It stopped working less than a year after purchase. I would not recommend this to anyone. Not a good purchase at all. Waste money
5,Best handheld we have ever owned,The Shark has everything we wanted in a handheld vacuum. The suction is much superior to other brands. The attachments permit us to use our Shark in all kinds of situations.The ease of cleaning the filter system makes the Shark a pleasure to work with.
2,Good suction but very unreliable,"This is a great-looking silver-plated guy, it reminds me a spacecraft. Its suction is good. But it is poorly made (in China): it is difficult to unlock it for cleaning and more difficult to lock it back. And it served us only 1.5 years with very light use. Now we are throwing it away because the repair costs almost the same as the new one."
1,Great concept but mediocre.,"This is listed as the most powerful hand vacuum. The power is certainly adequate. Thats where the benefits end.The device is difficult to remove and replace in the included caddy. Unless fitted perfectly, it will not charge. What is worse, if it is not charging, it spontaneously discharges. Without using the device, the battery is flat within 12 hours. A 2 penny diode in the charging circuit would have avoided this."
2,Works Great for the First Month...Then.....,"This vac has very good attachments, and the suction is powerful, but after only a month or so of use, the battery will not hold a charge..Now that the vacuum is about a year old it may work for 30 seconds or so. Can't accomplish much in 30 seconds....The batteries are non-replaceable, so basically this is junk headed for the landfill...."
1,Do not waste your money,"Initialy the suction was strong but within six months the battery life was down to 2 minutes. The dust cup is a mess to clean out. The unit is heavy, and it does not fit well on the charger base. It is going into the trash!"
1,Terrible product,"This Vac stops working after a few month, the Vac is loud and battery life is extremely short. On a full charge, it can only vac for a few minutes, very disappointing."
1,rip-off,"Description sounded great, worked O.K. for less than 3 months then the battery died. Avoid this product"
1,12 NICKEL-CADMIUM BATTERIES THAT FAIL FAST,Do not buy this product. It was fantastic for the first month or two [except that the extension tubes kept falling off]. Then it got weaker and weaker over the next month or so until it failed to hold a charge at all. I decided to get a new battery pack and was surprised to find that the pack is comprised of TWELVE 1.2v environmentally-unfriendly Ni-Cad batteries. Replacement is not readily available and it's doubtful that the vacuum is worth the cost of a new battery pack anyway. What a waste.
1,Not worth the money!!,A good old fashioned broom and dustpan can do a faster and better job than this ...! It's supposed to run for at least 20 minutes before needing to be recharged. Ours has never lasted longer than 4 minutes before dying and we keep it charged at all times! You'd be better off purchasing a Dirt Devil or a Dustbuster!
1,Not impressed,"The Shark started out great, but after a few uses the charge time seemed to diminish. I am going to return it because now it doesn't even stay on more than 2 minutes (even when it has been charged for days). It's too bad because I really liked the design and attachments."
2,"IT'S OK, BUT COULD BE BETTER",I ACTUALLY RETURNED THIS ITEM AFTER I USED IT ONLY ONCE. OUT OF THE BOX (AFTER THE FIRST CHARGE) IT DID NOT WORK. I TOOK THE BATTERY COVER OFF AND FOUND THAT ONE OF THE LEADS WAS DISCONNECTED. ONCE I GOT PAST THAT ISSUE I BEGAN USING IT IN OUR KITCHEN. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES THE POWER BEGAN TO DIMINISH. AT FULL CHARGE IT PICKED UP DIRT VERY WELL BUT THE POORLY DESIGNED EXTENSION TUBES KEPT COMING APART. BASICALLY THIS VACUUM NOT AT ALL WHAT I HAD EXPECTED.
1,I wish I could say it SUCKS!,"The battery pack is worthless. Everything about it,I have been unhappy with. When I bought it, it had received great reviews. I don't know what those people were thinking."
4,Small but mighty,"I had a corded Shark vac which was very powerful for its size, and was anxious to see how this cordless model would perform. Really excellent, although it is pretty noisy. Much more powerful than a Dustbuster - they aren't even in the same league. My only concern is about durability - it has a small, high-revving motor - and battery life (the battery is replaceable but probably costs $$$) but I will just have to wait and see if those concerns are legitimate."
3,"Great vaccum, Terrible battery","We got this as a wedding gift. It works fine and it's simple to use, but the battery life is horrible. At first, the battery lasts plenty of time to vaccuum your floor.Then after 1 year my battery only works for less than 1 minute! I've cleaned the filter and charged it, but it still only holds about a 1 minute charge."
1,Agree with terrible reviews,I've now had the Shark 1 year and it is worthless. It started heading towards worthless after just a few months use. The attachments are all breaking and the battery no longer holds a charge. I should have read the reviews.
1,"I'll Never Buy Another ""Shark"" Again","Save yourselves the expense and agony of buying this hand-vac. It works great at first ... for about 3 months. Then the battery begins to die down and finally drops dead in about 6 months. In fact, I bought this as a replacement for the same vac I'd bought 6 months earlier as that one died on me. I thought I must have done something for it to have died but. As it turns out, according to the other reviews here, it looks like I'm not the only one to have had this same problem. Their customer service also, obviously, doesn't care for I have not received any reply to my e-mail to them. So, finally, I gave up and ordered a new Black and Decker."
1,Same problem as others - battery!,"I've had this vacuum for some time (two years?) and hardly ever use it. The battery has lost its ability to hold a charge over time. It lasts less than a minute. It was a waste of money and I'm throwing it away. Besides the battery issue, it has a rather large footprint and takes up a lot of space. I would recommend Black and Decker's handheld with the removable batteries. You won't get as many attachments but then what good are the tools if the battery doesn't last for more than a minute?"
4,Great vacum,"I have owned the cordless Shark for about 6 months...it is great. It has great suction, easy to clean and the attachments come in handy. I highly reccommend it."
1,Battery life disappointing,"I am truly disappointed in the battery life in my EP750ST. After using it for less than 5 months, the battery will only run the unit for about 1 minute -- half of which is only at half power. I was told by customer service that the battery is not covered by warranty, the usual life is less than 6 months even with periodic draining, and costs half the price of a new machine ($25)! The Dustbuster is looking pretty good right now!"
1,Do not Buy,This vac was just ok for about 6 months. However it would not hold a charge and finally would not work at all. Do not buy.
1,Another Disappointed Customer,"My Euro-Pro Cordless Shark Hand Vacuum EP750ST seems to have the same problem as many other customers. The battery life is just too short. I bought the product around 10 months ago and now, the unit will not run for more than 30 seconds without dying on me. When I first used the unit, I found the suction capacity to be far superior to the Dustbuster I owned ages ago. Initially, I was actually quite pleased with the product. I used to use the Euro-Pro unit about 3 times a week and would always return the unit to the charger after each use, just as the directions state. Nevertheless, the battery does not charge even close to capacity anymore and running the unit for 30 seconds is not of much value to me. Thus, I am back to using my Dirt Devil Ultra Hand Vac that I bought 5 years ago once again. It has to be plugged into the wall, but at least it does not die on me unless there is a power outage."
1,Doesn't work after 2 months!,"Don't bother to spend your money on this vacumn. I've used and charged this vacumn properly as per instructions, and after two months it would no longer hold a charge. Don't even think of buying this product."
1,Shark is Actually a Minnow,"I bought this item because of its sleak looks and claim of being the strongest hand vac in its class. Well, I found that the suction power was terrible. I tried to vacuum my staircase but the thing ran out of power even before I was finished. Even worse, because the suction power of the ""Shark"" was so weak, I decided to try to vacuum my caar with it plugged into an outlet. After about 15 minutes, the ""Shark"" just stopped working. I took it back and decided to buy a non-cordless handvac. This time, I bought the Dirt Devil Scorpion. Let me tell you, this is a real hand vac. When you turn it on, it actually kicks because it is so powerful. The Scorpion is only $20.00."
1,SHARK ! More like a dead kipper !,Well well welllooks like i had sucker writen on my face todead as a door nail this SUCKS!battery started to die so I gave it a good long chargeand low and behold the battery fryed the Transformer .
3,"Good easy workout, very bad camera work!","I like the Dance Away series for easy workouts - they are good for light days; the choreography is straightforward and they are easy to follow. It's fun to work out with retro music! However, I prefer the Molly Fox Dance Away videos (1960s, 1970s, 1980s) to this video, which Fox does not host. The production values in those other videos appears to be higher too - i.e. better sets and better lighting. My biggest complaint about this video, though, is the VERY BAD camera work. The camera focuses for long periods of time on the dancers' feet, ignoring their hands and arm movements. This makes it more difficult to follow the aerobics! I also found that this video incorporated fewer actual dances than the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s video did. Still, I would recommend this video for a light workout."
2,This is not a mystery.,"This book is not a mystery story. It is a thriller. Don't expect to be challenged to figure out who the bad guys are, you are told who they are immediately. Not that this approach is wrong, there are plenty of good stories that don't make you guess.The main problem with this book is that there is no logic behind the action. The main bad guy has no motive for his actions. Impossible coincidences are routine. Plot points are dropped never to be seen again. (What is the significance of the gems in the egg?) The conclusion makes no sense.On the other hand, a friend I lent the book to said she liked it. Turn off your mind and you might too."
3,"So much potential, just no delivery","This book had everything I like going for it: art crime, Russian history, Faberge, and real life characters like Kip Forbes. While it is a very nice read, it fails to deliver on suspense and several plot lines. Thereare many loose ends that are not wound up, and the reader ceases to care about them. Coincidences abound and there is very little that links certain points together other than incredible chance. It is a good, quick read and very entertaining but lacks the power of some of my favorites like The Eight which delivers incredible well. I have not read any of the authors other works and will perhaps seek them out, but I am still in need of a new literary to entice me to read their entire body of work. I am open to suggestions if anyone has them."
3,classic slept on p funk,clinton's trying hard to cash in the 80's not his best work but not his worst either if you truly love p funk you should get this.
3,A wonder,One has to wonder what Clinton was thinking at this point. Interest in his classic work was at an all time high at this time. But instead of making a serious P funk album he made an eighties urban pop album. All the songs sound like the the product of some serious all night coke binges. There are a few intersting parts on this disc but over all it falls way short. Even by latter day Clinton standards. This is a weak effort.
2,Don't waste your money,I tried this vacuum in the store and was impressed with the extra large back wheels that made it push smoothly. I got it home and the vacuum overheated constantly. It takes at least a half hour for the thing to cool down so you can use it again. I thought that I might have just have a lemon so I exchanged it for a new one. Same thing. It clogs very easily and requires four screws to be removed to take the top cover off to get to the belt or anything that might need unclogging inside. Then it is a challenge to get the cover back on. The only thing I like besides the easy maneuvering is the reuseable bag.
2,IT'S WONDERFUL --- WHEN IT WORKS,We bought cause it looked cute in the store and it wasn't too pricy. The problem is it overheats easily causing the rubber belt to melt. Removing the cover and changing the belt is a struggle. You may also have problems finding the belts to purchase. The ones I've seen in the store come with the bags which I don't really need right now. I was disapointed that it's quite noisy although maybe slightly less so than the old Eureka we have. So now we have two clunkers and will have to soon shop for a decent vacuum cleaner.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"After spending $200+ on my last vacuum, only to have it die after about 3 years, I decided to spend less on this Euro-Pro Shark. So what if I have to replace it earlier, I figured -- I'll still be ahead of the game, pricewise. I couldn't have been more wrong. Within the first week, the belt started burning and had to be replaced. Within 2 months, we've replaced the belt twice more. I'm now looking at replacing it after 3 months -- at this rate, I would have been better off buying another $200 plus vacuum that would last me 3 years. I learned my lesson -- you really do get what you pay for!"
1,Burns up to quickly,I bought this vacuum and liked it at first but then you go through belts like crazy as they burn up real quick. Everytime I use it it smells like something is burning. A hose on it broke and I can not find replacement parts for it. And you can only order the replacement bags online. Don't waste the money on this one.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this product less than a year ago and it won't recognize a new bag. It is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money.
1,Big disappointment,After 10 years with a Hoover vaccuum I was ready to purchase a new vaccuum. What a big disappointment it was when after only 2 months this vaccuum over heated and burned up belts by the dozens. I would not reccommed this product to anyone!
5,Lisa Sanders is AWESOME and her CD is a MUST HAVE item!!,"New artists come and go but Lisa Sanders is a keeper! I had the pleasure of meeting Lisa and experiencing her live performance during the beginning of this month. After purchasing and listening to her CD, I can honestly say that it reflects what you would expect hear live. Lisa's music is heart felt, real, moving, and emotional. Lisa is a powerful, sensitive, witty, and inspiring artist who has something to say... she is AWESOME! I have her CD in constant play at home and on the road! If you enjoy lyrically driven, female singer/songwriters that have the ability to move you emotionally, then you would definitely love Lisa! This CD is one of the best I've heard in a long time! I'm sure you'll agree. LISA SANDERS...ISN'T LIFE FINE...BUY IT!!"
5,Lisa Sanders-She rocks!,I met Lisa a couple of years ago in a small group setting of women ranging in all ages. I knew from the moment I heard her sing her first few notes that she was going to be a hit and I was going to be a follower. Her CD Isn't Life Fine is a fantastic piece of art and her brand new CD Life Takes You Flying will fill you with emotions you may have forgotten you have. She is a genuine artist who has now one San Diego Acoustic Artist of the year two years in a row. The only other San Diego singer to do that was a woman named... Jewel(perhaps you have heard of her :)!
5,***THE BEST LANCET***,"The BD ultra-fine lancets are the best lancets out there! I have been a type 1 diabetic for 19 years and have tried lots of lancets and lancet devices. I've used the freebies that come with glucose meters, I've bought various brands (including store brands) of lancets and none compare. As the other reviewer stated, it is nice that the cap can go back on after use. I love these so much that I don't even use a lancet device to prick my finger. I just poke the needle in my finger. I was bruising from the devices and doing it on my own allows me to control the amount of pressure used. I continue to use the 30 gauge because they are great and I don't want to spend the extra $$ on the 33 gauge. I highly recommend these! I also love that Amazon sells them (cheaper too!) because I've been having a hard time finding them at Target, CVS, Walgreens, etc."
3,Sad Story About A Pig,"Johnny the pig started off as a family pet for a poor girl Emily. The pig was the runt of the litter and no one wanted him. He was given to Emily who treated him as a pet even though the understanding was that he would eventually be eaten. The pig Johnny was very smart and acted like a dog. As the pig got older, he was not as active, and like older pets, he just hung around eating and sleeping. For this poor family who owed many bills, the animal was a luxury that they couldn't afford. Emily comes home from school one day and Johnny is not there. He was sent to the butcher's as payment for a bill. It was devastating to her and also to me. I haven't wanted pork or bacon since. This book was good reading. It is set in the 1920's and the idiomatic language is difficult at times to follow. But overall if you like sad animal stories, you will like this book."
4,"Lively and fun, a taste of Columbia","Insturmental and vocals of popular, traditional Columbian songs. Very lively and ""fun"" music. I don't speak the language, so I have no idea what the lyrics say, but they sure sound like they're enjoying themselves. Great rhythms. Makes you want to get up and dance!"
5,Classic!,"There is no way you can go wrong with one of the original Pokemon games. Sure, there are some flaws in the type match-ups and stats, but it makes up for that in nostalgia!"
4,"""Pokemon Yellow Special Pikachu Edition"" is worth the price.","About a year ago, I too was drawn into the Pokemon fad. I played Pokemon Red a little bit when one of my friends came over. I enjoyed it, but it seemed a bit complicated. I finally got version yellow. The hardest part of the game is at the beginning. (But I won't tell you why <evil laugh> >:) .) Anyways, once you get past that part, the rest is of average difficulty for a game. Graphics are par for the GBC, and the battle scenes are cool. Sound is great, and the amount of different sounds puts me in awe. Now that I'm over the Pokemon craze, I see that it is not quite a five-star game, but still worth four stars."
4,Great Pokemon Game,I am old school when it comes to Pokemon and this is one of the best of the original three games. The controls and goal are the same as in Red and Blue with a few new features such as Pikachu following you and being able to check its mood and the introduction of Team Rocket's Jesse and James.
3,zap!,"zap! in this action packed pokemon game, you get a pikachu as your starter and all the other kanto starters as a freebie! availabe is MEWTWO,MISSINGO, and much more! it works oh so fine and fun!"
3,Not enough new features to warrant a buy.,"I believe Pokemon Red and Blue were in the top 5 for best games ever for the beloved GBC. I remember getting the Red version when it came out and I remember being floored by the depth and involvement in the game. The beautiful world to explore truly made the experience interesting while keeping simplicity as the key factor. (As to not confuse younger kids). The only new features to Yellow Version are a few graphical changes to Pokemon during battles and the addition of the cartoon characters from the TV series, Jesse & James from Team Rocket. If you already own Red or Blue then avoid Yellow and buy Gold or Silver."
2,"If you like Pokemon, buy this. If you don't, don't bother.","This game is really pretty fun. For the first 45 hours. Then it just starts to get a liiittle boring. I mean, how long can you go before you start to get sick of blacking out and listening to the other trainers idiotic comments which really don't apply to the game? I got this game in July. I'm still playing. Ok, so maybe I'm not the most fabulous gamer in the world, but I'm not that bad. If you love pokemon and have a good attention span, buy this game. If not, don't bother.P.S- If you're a girl, prepare yourself for lots of annoying little digs from the girl trainers (Oh, I broke a nail, Oh no, I messed up my hair,Oh no, I have absolutly no personality or life,ect. ect.)."
2,This game sucks,"This is the so called ""Better version"" of pokemon blue and Red. The only thing that's better is that you can get Charmander , Squitle , and bulbasaur. the graphics chanmged a little bit and Pikachu is the only pokemon that cries it's name!!! Why is that? But Pikachu learns new atyttacks like: Dulble team at Lv.15. It raises your Envade. Slam at Lv 20 . A normal phsical attack . and Thunderbolt at Lv.26. Pikachu is your starting pokemon. But It can't evovle. Raichu like kicks ass. Raichu has one attack Pikachu doesn't, Mega Punch. for people that don't know this but sometimes you nmeed to make some of your pokemon to elvove to mlearn new moves."
2,So So,"I received this game as a gift and found it to be time consuming but not that great. First off, you have to go back to boards you have already been to like a hundred times, which really eats my patience...secondly it's a bit vague as to which way i am supposed to go and how to get there. It's ok if you like a loooonnng game, but i am more of the super mario brothers type..."
2,the same as blue or yellow,"When I first played this game I was excited with pokemon fever and started playing,but as the game dragged on I started to notice its similarities to blue and yellow.First there might a few more pokemon and pikachu follows you around.After realizing that fact the game got more and more boring.I realized such a bad investmrnt I made and stopped playing it.So in short I would not reccemend this game for anyone"
3,Um... Not TOO good...,I don't like Yellow Version because:1.Picachu follows you all along.2.The pictures are ugly.
1,Waste of time and money,"this game is a waste of your time and money. There only only * to buy this game:1# You get a Pikachu immediately, and don't have to catch one2# In the game you recieve a Bulbasaur, a Charmander, and a Squirtel. In the Blue/Red verisons, you have to decide between them.3# This follows the idea of the TV show.Those are the other reasons why you should buy Pokemon Yellow. Buy Crystal imstead."
1,This game is TERRIBLE!,"I think that this is a horrible game! I dont like the graphics .Its like playing pokemon blue and red...its exactly the same thing! It it repetitive and it gets boring after playing it for 2 or 3 minutes...the hole game is doing the same thing: fight, fight, fight...BORING!"
1,The hardest Pokemon game!,"If you have a Gameshark, get this game. I thought it would be easy, but now I need a Gameshark. I named my Pikachu Rocky and it only says ""Pika"" on Stadium. If you're good at Stadium, you could get this game too. Get if you can beat Red and Blue without cheating. That is what Yellow is like without a GameShark. I can't even pass Celadon City because Pikachu is so scared."
4,Good No Matter How Old I Get,I initially got this game when I was around 9 or 10. It was my very first video game and I spent endless hours with it. It is a great game for anyone who likes Pokemon and just about everyone else. Very worth the buy.
5,Still a favorite,"Don't abandon your Gameboy Color just yet! I got this game in 1998 when I was eight-years-old and almost eight years later, it is still one of my favorite games. Definitely a must have for all ages!"
5,Awesome game,This was an amazing game and it's such a classic. My only complaint is that when I'm in caves I can't seem to ever find any zubats.
4,Pokemon Yellow VS. Red & Blue,"Hello,I wanted to say that this game is cool, but if you don't have red or blue don't get yellow 'till you do. Red and blue have the same pokemon and almost the same features, but are a little more fun to play and more simplistic."
4,Just OK,"I think this game is good, but it wasn't very original. If you own Blue and Red, then this isn't worth buying, unless you must have it. The only big difference is that Team Rocket is in it and Pikachu follows you everywhere. But overall a good game."
5,Pickachu's own title,After Blue and Red came out Yellow came out in 1999. Heres the cool things in this game.Jesse and James appear with thier same pokemon.New Pokemon looks.Color!!!Pickachu follows you and you get to talk to him.Print pictures out.Bad thingsabout 10 pokemon are missing.Practically after 10 steps you run into a pokemon.Overall this is a cool game but Sapphire is much better. Can't wait until Fire Red and Leaf Green comes out. I've already reseved my copy at Toys R Us.
4,Get it,"I tried this game and it rocks!!!After playing as Ash and being able to get Pikachu as your first in stead of the regular 3 I love this.Plus you can get all of the begining pokemon in the game with out any tradeing at all,so that means you don't have to trade back and frouth frouth and back. Thats why I given an A+++"
4,tv to gbc,this is a challenging game.Plus for people who like the tv show this is a game for them. the really hard part is to make the pikachu who follows you the happiest level wich is 3 hearts (i think). well if you want a challenging pokemon game this is one of the best.
5,Perfect Game,"Awsome game.Gra.phics-okay,but who cares?This game rules!You learn stragaty.It also is cute when Pikachu walks with you.Perfect for both beginners and pros."
5,BEST GAME HE EVER GOT!!!,He wanted this more than any game he ever asked for....I could have got it $10 cheaper if I had waited and got it at the flea market but ya never know when they are gonna have it or not
4,"fine game, despite general pokemon fatigue","If you can stand pokemon, then play and enjoy. Exellent replaying value, addictive. Too many repetative battles with the same type of creatures, but you can always walk away, if not in a mood to fight."
2,Bad,I bought it and it was the same game as red and blue just with that stupid pikachu.Let me tell you.Pikachu is a very week pokemon and he could beat almost none of the guys.The only cool thing was that pikachu follwed u around.I recomend it if you don't have red or blue but if u do don't get it.
4,VERY CHALLENGING! Red and Blue was better,"This games okay. Pikachu is cute. The game is very challenging. Sabrina is VERY, VERY, VERY HARD TO BEAT! What ever you do, DON'T GET THIS GAME! Get Red or Blue."
3,"Okay, but it's an obvious repeat","Being an owner of Pokemon Red, I had hoped that there would be more to Pokemon Yellow. Okay, it's great what they've done to the Pokedex and I love how they changed the storyline to be closer to the TV show, but...it's the same! Also, I had hoped that you could choose to be a guy or girl (of course that was a rumour...) and you have to have...Pikachu. It's cute for a while, but unlike many others, I am not a Pikachu fan. If you could choose between it and some other well-liked Pokemon, that would be okay, but I'm afraid Pikachu isn't that useful (At least if I had Bulbasaur I could defeat Brock instead of having to get more Pokemon faster). Also, in order to do the special battles, you have to have a friend with Pokemon Yellow. My friend has Blue (it didn't work). No offense to anyone who loved the game (and there seems to be a lot), but I only recommend this game to new-comers and die-hard Pikachu fans."
3,Not much of an improvement,"I liked the game. I really did. Only problem is that I already played Red and Blue, and this one doesn't have all that many advantages! If you haven't played any Pokemon, I'd recommend this one because the graphics are much better and you can get all of the Big Three Pokemon-- Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle-- without trading. Otherwise there are no new Pokemon, so if you've already played Red and Blue, don't bother with it-- just wait for Gold and Silver. Now those are cool!"
4,Yellow Version,"What makes this game slightly more fun than Pok'emon Blue, and Red versions, is that not only does your Pikachu follow you around OUTSIDE of its Poke ball, but you can get Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle without having to trade with your friends! Most people are into the newer Pok'emon games now, but I personally think the older Pok'emon games are much easier, especially because there are WAY less Pok'emon to catch.Overall, I'd say this is a very good game."
5,POKEMON FEVER,"POKEMON YELLOW- IF YOU LIKED POKEMON BLUE AND RED OR IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST POKEMON GAME AND YOU EITHER LIKE POKEMON OR ARE JUST TRYING IT, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. IT IS BETTER THAN RED AND BLUE. IT FOLLOWS THE SHOW MORE. SO IF YOU LIKE POKEMON I RECOMMEND THIS GAME. IT'S JAMMIN-BY: JUSTIN"
5,pokemon yellow review,I really had fun with this game I really liked the fact that you starter pokemon is a pichachu
4,Good game but gets boring fast,"When I first got this game I thought it was the best game ever, but after you beat it 2 or 3 times it gets very boring. If you want a game that will keep your attention I suggest Dragon Warrior Monsters, but if you're completely set on Pokemon then go with yellow version, It has better color than red or blue versions."
4,the final telling of the original storry,"This game is truly excellent with upgraded graphics in versus and several cameos from the original TV series that weren't in red or blue such as (nurse joy's chancey, jessey james and meowth of team rocket, as well as an appearance by officer jenney in vermillion) in adition to these cool cameos this game enables you to aquire all of the other two games' starters (charmander bulbasaur and squirtle, and even the eevee that gary recieves at the beginning of the game). enjoyed many long hours of game play as well as the interactive options that your pikachu displays. like the other two you cam download your team onto the nintendo 64's pokemon stadiam for 3D battles and neat treats should you do well enough to unlock them. if you liked red or blue versions or especially if you're a fan of the orriginal series, you should make this purchace.WARNING!! DOES NOT FUNCTION ON THE NINTENDO DS SYSTEMS!!"
1,Dont buy it if you own Red or Blue!,I would just like to say this is a compete rip-off to get money for PKMN Red and Blue owners. Here is a list of problems:A. No new PokemonB. Just a little tiny bit of easier way to get Pokemon that are rare.C. Not as much of a challenge as Red or Blue.D. Pikachu doesnt evolveE. The game is VERY bad
1,pikach tastes like chicken,I like pikachu yellow version it tastes good.no it is the most boring game in teh universe . You might like it if you Are a chinese midgit with electricty coming out of your eyes nose and ears. the most memorable time i have played the game is the time i burned it.i think my dog likes it better than me he uses it as a chew toy . if your looking for a real game not a chew toy for your dog look no further than harvest moon or legend of zelda. the first time i bought pikachu edithion it was a hard choice between it and barney roundup.this is just my opinion and my dogs
2,Copy Cat Pikachu,This game is to much like Red and Blue version to me. It establishes that you just have to buy all the games. If you already have Red or Blue this is a waste of money although it is okay I guess. Plus you can't do codes on it. It's not true that all the pokemon are installed on this game like people say.
3,Buy Gal Civ II instead,"Got around to playing this game and the expansion pack years after its release. Probably a bit jaded, but I wasn't impressed. The A.I. is very good, but there are no ship customization options, space battles are a joke (no depth), with only a handful of different ship types per race.For a few dollars more (remember the Clint Eastwood movie?), invest in GalCiv II. That game improves on the first version in every area."
4,Don't Let Dummies fool you into thinking it has no depth!!!,"I used Transcender and this book in conjuntion for about 1 month and I was able to easily pass the 70-210 test. I am an Administrator and an MCSE but 2000 is completely different(at least what they test the test covers mainly changes between NT and 2000). I work for a company that still uses NT 4.0 and I have never really used 2000 in a large network enviornment like the one I currently handle, however this book really helped meout. It is good to cross reference between Transcender and this book. The way it is written gives you very simple explanations to problems you may find in other texts. It is definately a must have especially for the core 4 price. There were many questions on the exam that were almost worded the same in the practice tests in this book.I will end up spending [less money]instead of $2000 dollars on a crash course to get my MCSA."
4,comfortable with caution,"The strip that goes between the toes is not for beginner thong wearers as it is a little ""stiff"". Otherwise a good shoe."
5,Scrapbooking fans - you have to get this idea book!,"I got the second idea book yesterday, and am seriously in AWE of these women and their amazing talent! The book features all the new goodies Scrapworks came out with at HIA, which means you can hear the register ringing in your head as you flip through the book....""I need THAT, and THAT and THOSE!"" Oh my gosh! It's just awesome!! GET IT!!!!!!"
5,Virtuoso Jazz Guitar A La Django Reinhardt,"Ignore Bireli Lagrene at you own peril. Jaw dropping, smoking guitar work from one of the world's best pluckers. Mostly traditional jazz, with a high-talent, contemporary feel. Highly recommended!"
1,junk,"This isn't a poncho it's a bedsheet with black spot's and holes, but what do you expect it was made in taiwan. The only thing this is good for is being a ghost on holloween."
1,Drive was bad,"As others have said, the interface is from Teac but the actual drive is junk. It did not work on 3 different computers - both Windows XP and Windows 7. I found a drive from an old IBM laptop and made use of the interface. Don't buy this product unless you are willing to do your own composite. There are so many old floppy drives out there that it is disappointing to get one that wouldn't even work. I would give it less that a 1 if that were possible."
1,"Worked well at first, but broke down after a few hours","I was originally excited about this floppy drive, because I wanted to port some old DOS games. I was able to make disk images for about thirty disks. Then it mysteriously stopped recognizing EVERY disk I tried. I tried some of the disks I had successfully copied before--that I knew the drive could read--but the drive would not read even them anymore. If I tried to access them through Windows Explorer, it told me that the disks needed to be formatted. If I tried to make an image with WinImage, it told me that there was no disk in the drive. I tried using the drive on a different computer and got the same results.It looks like I have the exact same problem as some other people who only gave the drive a one-star rating. The product probably has a major design flaw if so many people have the same problem."
3,"Works fine, I guess...mostly...","The drive was seamless in regards to plug and play in Windows 7. The reason I bought this drive was to gain access to the data stored on my old floppy disks. I have a mix of 1.44MB diskettes and 720KB diskettes. According to the product description, this drive was supposed to be able to use 720KB floppies. Doesn't work. Trying to format a double density disk gives the error: ""Parameters not supported by drive."" or in other words, it can't deal with it! Disappointing. Guess I'm going to have to get an internal floppy drive.I have another drive of the exact same make without a ""branded"" cover (generic/doesn't say Sabrent) and it has the exact same limitation. In fact, if you don't care about 720KB disks, you might as well save a few bucks and buy the TEAC drive on Amazon for $15."
4,Saving the past,"So many floppy disks, so obsolete, but no more. I have been a computer user for over 40 years and have accumulated many files recorded on floppy disks and no longer supported by the hardware in my PC's. So I purchased this product and am able to examine them and save what I want instead of throwing it all away.Good investment."
4,Did the job(most of the time),"It was a gift for my wife, but I sat for a while and watched her work with it. It ran fine most of the time but locked up every now and then. Not sure if it was the machine or the floppy discs. Some of them were very old."
2,Just. Doesn't. Work,"What a huge disappointment. I bought this so I could access some word files on three old Sony double-sided floppies. The floppies have been stored carefully, but two wouldn't read -- the drive just spun and spun. The third floppy was initially readable. I was able to view and read the files, but when I tried to copy them to the hard drive on my iMac, there was an error. The floppy drive image vanished from the desktop, and I was never able to get the Sabrent drive to read that floppy again. (I disconnected it, reconnected it -- nothing worked.)I've tried attaching it to a Powerbook, and the drive's green light won't even come on when I put a disk in.So, a this purchase was a waste of money. Not only couldn't I copy my files, I now can't even SEE them. I will be returning this drive!"
3,USB flash drive,"I found that I had a bunch of 1.44 MB Floppy Disks that I had stored. Since my computer no longer has a 1.44 MB Disk Drive, I needed something to see what I had stored on the Disks. I bought the USB Flash Drive. The imformation on the Disks are no longer compatible so it was waste of money. But The NEXARK Flash Drive worked."
1,Will not work/No support,Unit will not read. Keeps asking if I want to format disk. Any help out there?
1,awful,"I purchased this because it was a good price, but, as many of you know, you get what you pay for.As soon as I got it, I tried to use it.Every USB port I put it in, it said that there was a problem with the device. I looked on-line to see if there were any drivers (the disc it came with was only good for Win 98) - nothing worked.It might have been a bad one, but, it was a brand I never heard of and that should have been it for me.Only gave it the one star because it looked nice and very lightweight, but, it didn't work, so - that really means nothing."
1,Surprised By Amazon,"Ordered this item (Sabrent SBT-UFDB) but received a TEAC FD-05PUB. Unit is recognized by my PC (running XP) but will not read any floppy disks. I feel that I cannot return it since it was not what I ordered. I won't be ordering from Amazon online again, will shop locally from now on. Would give it a zero rating if it would allow me. Very, Very Dissatisfied!!!"
1,JUNK,I have purchased many electrical items by far this is the worst. No matter what you do it operates its own way with nothing but bad operation. Peice of ----.
1,Returned to Amazon!,"Returned item. Most likey is not compatable with common implementations of XP--eg, Toshiba Satellite is incompatable with this product. Suggest Amazon not sell such stuff."
1,Floppy Flop,"I'm not happy...it read one disk, ate another then wouldn't read anything else. I'm not happy at all. It wasn't a good use of 37 dollars (19 for next day delivery)."
5,Worked Like A Charm,"Worked Like A Charm.I have a lot of old 3.5 disk and with a new computer this was a god send, works well with my old Sony FD-97 as while.."
4,Works great.,"This arrived quickly. It was easy, just plug in and go. I was able to retrieve a ton of pictures from some very old floppies!"
3,Reads my old Floppy Disks,"This drive will read my old floppy disks just fine which is what I expected when I bought it. My late model computer will not recognize this USB floppy drive as a bootable device but will recognize and boot from USB flash drives. So I cannot boot from a floppy into the old DOS operating system with this drive, not that I have a real need to do so."
3,Dead On Arrival,It's that simple DOA! Tried it with two computers will not work at all. I returned it for another one and that one does work fine. So maybe the first one was a fluke??
1,It dosen't work!,"I bought this unit two weeks ago. I've not been able to get it to work. I have tried to contact Sabrent (found the site thru google) repeatedly by e-mail, as no customer support number is available. I've yet to hear anything from them. I'm not happy with this product and there dosen't seem to be any customer support. I will most likely return this product to Amazon. :-(Rich"
4,External Floppy drive,"I have many photos on floppy disc and my new computers didn't come with a floppy drive. I will be using the drive with both my laptop and desk top. Shipping and setup were flawless. Would I buy this item again from Amazon? Yes, the price was right and the item was shipped promptly."
2,Mac users stay away...,"The product wont read disks when inserted if you have a Mac. You need to insert a disk then unplug the device and plug it back in. It also only read about one out of every four disks that I inserted. I only bought it because I found some old floppies and was curious as to what was on them. Mac users, if you need one of these drives I recommend one that Sony sells. I used it about a year ago then promptly sold it, a mistake on my part... The only reason I gave the Sabrent two stars is because it actually read a disk."
5,Sabrent 1.44MB External USB 2X Floppy Disk Drive,"""It works good. I will tell everybody. When somebody has a computer without A Drive, I will tell them to buy this one. I don't know what I would do if I did not hear about this one. Thank you for air mailing my order to me, real fast."""
1,Wish it had worked!,On receipt I attached the drive to my laptop. Windows did an instant install and all seemed to be fine. I then inserted a floppy full of JPGs for a test. To my dismay the drive locked up & refused to download the images. I then attempted to test it on my desktop thinking there could be a problem with the laptop. The desktop would not recognize the drive at all. The drive was returned to Amazon for a full refund (no problem there). I then purchased genuine Dell drive which works as designed on both computers. I can not recommend this unit.
1,Beware - Junk!,I have received two of these drivesNEXARK SABRENT External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive SBT-UFDB (Black). The 1st one was dead out of box. Nothing in the box but the drive. Looked like it was used (shame on you Amazon). I say that because I asked for a replacement and it was in a sealed box in a plastic bag with internal cardboard packing. The 2nd unit was recoginized by Windows but would not recognize any disk that was inserted. Just kept asking for a disk to be inserted. This time I asked for a refund. I'll try another brand. I'm an electronics engineer and have over 30 years experience with computers. My recommendation it to steer clear of this brand.
1,Don't waste your time!,"The Sabrent External Floppy Drive looks good and feels like it's well constructed. But, there are a few problems. No instruction for starters. Doesn't plug-and-play as advertised. I'm computer savy enough to get at the DOS A: command line and the floppy drive can't be accessed. This is a total dud!"
3,"May not boot, but other OK in XP","I need to boot to a floppy on occassion, so bought this since newer computers tend to not ship anymore with floppy drives but support USB floppy drive boot in the BIOS. This thing works OK when up and running in Windows XP(maybe a bit slow but hey, it's a floppy drive). However, as a boot device it is extremely unreliable (at least on Dell Optiplex 320's and 330's) and you can become wealthy by betting that it won't boot. Of course my office-mate's Sony external USB floppy drive, with the same boot diskette I am using, always works. So, I can't rate it higher than 3 stars, and that's only because it seemingly works OK in Windows and did not cost a fortune, but I am going to have to buy something else for booting to a USB floppy drive. Hope this helps."
1,Quirky for OS 9.3 and OS 10.1,"I am not happy with the performance of this drive with my Apple Power mac G-3. It is slow and error prone. I bought another that is much better. Pass on this item if you are an Apple owner, it's an annoyance for a Mac. Works fine with windows but I don't really need it for that :("
1,Trash,"Got one of these for my Dad to use with his plethora of old floppies that he refuses to give up. Install was of course easy, just plug it in and it installed itself on Windows 7. Put in a floppy, it read the files fine, opening files from it was slow, but they are floppies so no big deal. On the third disk it refused to read any files from it. From then on the drive would fail in reading every floppy inserted. The disks were confirmed to still be good as we could put them in his old desktop drive and they would open fine.Junk product."
3,Sabrent USB Floppy Disk Driver,"When I unpacked the item I found that the Driver software CD-ROM which was supposed to be enclosed was not there. I spent several days trying to contact Amazon about it, but found it impossible. My son finally found the software online. I am very unhappy with the way this turned out."
1,did not work!,"I bought this item for my mom because all the new computers do not have a floppy drive in them, and she needed one. This should have been a plug and play item, but when it was plugged in, it wouldn't play. Either it didn't even recognize the floppy disk went it was put in, or it always wanted to format any disk put into it. Did the same thing on both a Windows 98, 2000, and XP. Had to return it, and bought another brand."
1,Broke in 3 months...,"Do not buy this made in China product! After using it for 3 months, it stopped reading disks, saying that they needed to be formatted. When I tried formatting them, it would say it could not complete the format. So I tested out the disks on another computer, and they worked fine. There is no warranty, and it's past Amazon's return period. Waste of $20!!"
5,Just What I Needed,"This was exactly what I needed to save pictures that I had on floppy's. It was very easy to use, saved the family pictures to my desk top PC, then burned a CD with them, now I have them for easy access, and can share. The cost was so much lower than have a A drive put into the desk top, and I can also let friends and family use it to save their floppy file's.Kay"
5,It works as advertised,"Once each blue moon, a floppy disk is needed. These are great. No need for external power. Just plug it into the usb port, insert the floppy disk and do whatever is needed, then remove.I consult with small businesses, and would like to see one of these in each office rather than a floppy in each machine or the inability to access floppy drives.I recently had to reload Vista on a new machine and Intel had provided their network card drivers on a floppy disk! This little gem worked perfectly. It has also worked for the two clients I have sold it to."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Insisted on trying to format every disk I inserted. Would not read known good disks. Would not format fresh out of the box new disks. No Joy on 3 different machines (Win 7, Win XP and OS-X 10.6). Returned for credit.Subsequently purchased a similar unit (at twice the price) which worked fine on the same computers with the same media."
1,Many Problems,"This drive is very picky about what disks it reads and when it reads them. Sometimes I'll insert a disk and it will read it fine. At other times I'll insert a disk and get nothing. Also, it just refuses to read some disks at all. If you have a lot of disks to write to, this may be the drive for you. However, if you are trying to get data off of one particular disk, you are playing a game of chance."
1,"Do Not Buy, Would Not Read Disk, Bad Design","Drive does not read floppy disks. The drive wanted to format every disk but the formatting was not successful. It wanted to format disks that worked on other pc's. This is the second one of these drives that I have tried from this China manufacture; the first one lasted a week before it failed. Do not buy this brand, you will be disappointed."
3,"good price, works okay, but cheaply and flimsily made","I had a Memorex usb floppy drive and it was destroyed. So I ordered this ""Sabrent"" floppy drive. The packaging said it is actually made by Teak, which is a little reassuring. It seems to work fine. However it is flimsy and cheap in design. The floppy discs do not slide in and out smoothly, and when the eject button is pressed, you don't get the usual popping-out action you get with standard floppy drives.If you need a floppy drive for a specific task, this will do the job, but if you want a floppy drive to enhance your desktop or laptop computer, I would recommend the Memorex over this one for a few extra bucks. BTW, the Memorex has a vertical mount-stand, which this one does not."
1,DID NOT LAST 3 WEEKS,"This product did not last longer the 2 weeks and stopped working. I am extremely disappointed and will never order from Margin Mart Inc through Amazon.com again. They want my now to pay to return the defective item at my expense.This is unacceptable. I knew the item was inexpensive compared to going directly to Sony but it was not worth the $, headache or time spent.I do not recommend anyone purchasing even though the product price is soo low."
2,Didnt Last 2 months and is NOT an OEM lamp!!,"I purchased this item with the understanding per the write up and description here on Amazon, that this was an OEM lamp. It didn't last 60 days before it burned out, and from the moment I installed it, the picture was never as bright and clear as my original lamp. Since purchasing this, I have learned that only 2 companies have the OEM license to make this product, Osram and Phillips. In both cases, the lamp alone goes for around $150. Dealer cost is greater than the sell price on this site."
1,Sony XL-2200 LCD Lamp,"The lamp was installed in my TV on June 25. After two weeks of use, the lamp blew up inside my TV. I have emailed the company for a refund, or reploacement under the condition, that they warranty the lamp. My old lamp made by Philips lasted over four years."
1,Dead in a year. Surprised given the original price.,"Paid $90 for this back in early 2011 and installed it with no trouble. Came with small wrench for removing old bulb. Definitely not a Sony brand product, but it fixed the immediate issue and the TV was back in working condition.Bulb died within 13 months. Prices seem to have dropped considerably at this point so I wouldn't be disappointed with it at current prices, but I'm not thrilled with the value for the previous price."
1,not a real xl2200 it is a piece of junk,went dim in 3- 4 months. Loud pop and went out. before 6 months. DO NOT BUYThe Lamp BLEW UP!. Glass shattered! Smell of burning capacitor. The whole works. THis thing is a fire hazard. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS VENDOR!!
1,Sony XL-2200 Replacement Lamp,"The lamp worked, but the top portion of the television screen was a shade of pink/red due to a defective bulb. And, I found one at a cheaper cost that worked properly."
1,Lamp survived less than 6 months!,"I bought this lamp knowing that the Philips lamp is no longer available and this is the only one to buy. I was skeptical after reading the reviews here, but decided there really was little choice.The lamp died suddenly less than 6 months after we purchased it. While lamp bulbs do occasionally burn out, there is no warranty that protects us in this case."
1,Is It Even a Sony?,"According to my husband, this may not even be a Sony projector lamp. All I know is that our T.V. still is very dark, at the point that dark scenes (indoors or outdoors) are almost impossible to define."
1,Only lasted one day,I got the item in good condition. Installation was a breeze. great picture first day. Turn on tv day 2 and the bulb popped and that was all she wrote. Double checked install and I installed correctly. Not a great product
1,Not Sony Product,Amazon site said by sony.and that is not what you get.Can buy other cheap bulb for a lot less.I wanted A sony bulb.
5,Bulb replacement,I shopped around and through Amazon I found the best price. There is a generic off brand bulb but I didnt think it was worth risking. The Sony bulb made my tv picture brand new. I didnt realize how dim it had become. It took me less then 3 mins to change the bulb (including using the directions). If you can use a screw driver to remove 3 screws you will save yourself $100 or more to have a service tech come out to do that for you. I will buy my next replacement bulb from Amazon again. Great price and quick shipping.
4,Better than most,"I'll be short simple an to the key points here ... NOT A SONY BULB ! Don't be fooled or mislead . It's similar in look feel fit and performance but it's clearly NOT a Sony bulb . Sure it costs a fraction of the price of the SONY version but don't be mislead ... Performance and build are from what i've seen better than alot of the other knock off's and copy cat's out there but you will know when comparing side by side , it's not a SONY bulb ."
2,Lamp,"does not work on my TV, nothing wrong with the lamp shipping was good also but after installed got pink color in my screen. have to send it back."
1,WARNING!!!!,"DO NOT....I REPEAT DO NOT purchase the Sony xl-2200 replacement lamp from any retailer other than Sony.com. I purchase what I though was an authentic Sony manufactured replacement lamp from Amazon.com, only to find out it was a Sony compatible lamp and has NO WARRANTY and FAILS WITHIN MONTHS of installation. If you see ANY vendor listed on here stating it is made by Sony that is a blatant lie and complete deception. Upon calling Sony they informed me that they do not allow ANY store or retailer to sell their lamps and you can only get an authentic Sony manufactured lamp from Sony.If you wish to purchase any xl-2200 replacement lamp from this site, consider yourself warned that it will fail within 6 months and you will be purchasing a new one as Amazon and the 3rd party vendor will not honor any warranty on the product and you will not get a refund or replacement."
5,SUPER EASY!,"Like other reviews, we purchased a warranty when we purchased our television as recommended by the salesperson stating the lamp would not last 3 years but it lasted 5 years with above average use plus the business we purchased the television from has gone out of business and we could not renew the warranty if we wanted to but this website made it super simple to purchase exactly what we needed. The description was right on along with the picture. We still had the television manual so just had to remove the old lamp (also super simple), find it online, order and install - well worth the money!"
2,Pay less for the real deal,"This is an OSRAM bulb, it should be clearly stated. Turns out you can buy genuine bulbs for less at other sites - although it is a little harder to be sure of what you are getting. You want to find one that is marked as Sony OEM (not ""OEM Compatible"") and made from Philips.I'm sure it would have worked fine if I was looking for a copy, but I wasn't.Thank you for wasting my time and your money by shipping it to me before I knew I wasn't getting the real thing."
2,not long,This lamp just burned out on me after only 16 mths. Original lamp lasted 7 yrs. Guess I got my moneys worth?
5,Projector Lamp,"I knew that I'd have to replace this lamp at some point, as no light bulb lasts forever. The one I replaced - original equipment - lasted for about 6 or 7 years. And we watch a LOT of TV; probably averaging 6 hours per day. The old one started to have 30-60 second intervals where it just turned off. The fan would run and then it would turn back on and the picture would return. The new bulb took less than ten minutes to replace and works perfectly. The picture on my 60"" Sony Wega projection TV is as beautiful as ever. As the old one still worked most of the time (usually hours between failures) I'm keeping it for emergencies for the time being."
4,Would it be so hard to include a 4 mm. allen wrench?,"Lamp works great. TV settings had to be re-adjusted and as several reviewers had noted, the picture quality now looks superb. The only irritating thing about replacing the lamp was finding the right-sized allen wrench. I had to take 2 trips to Home Depot (first purchased standard set then realized that a 4 mm-sized allen wrench was needed, so I had to purchase metric set too!!)"
1,Saying it's a POC would be too complimentry as is a one star rating.,"This lamp deserves a minus 10 star rating and even that might be too high.This lamp blew out twelve (12) days after it was installed. When I went through the process to return it, the seller, Lamp Monsters LLC, wasn't anywhere in the loop. Amazon, not the seller, refunded the purchase price and shipping.After looking at it closely as I was packaging it to send it back, I found it's not from Sony but some cheap, poorly made after market piece of junk manufacturer. Don't be lured by cheap prices on what appears to be the real deal from Lamp Monsters LLC - if it looks too good to be true it will be junk and Lamp Monsters LLC will be selling it."
1,Best of Jack Jones,"I simply enjoyed hearing these olde but goodies from Jack Jones. His style is soothing, His range mellow. I haven""t heard him in several years and this CD made me remember that talent is still talent no matter how long its around."
1,YUCK!,What is this?! Eric from the little mermaid?! And I thought he was ugly in the movie!Note: Save your child from the embarrassment and GET A NOTHER DOLL!Jackie
5,WOW!,"One word describes Dan Seals: Amazing! His songs are so full of emotion and are absolutely touching. He sings real, traditional country music, which is refreshing to hear in an age where real, true country music has almost been replaced by ""crossover"" country-pop music. My favorite songs on the album were ""Everything That Glitters Is Not Gold"", ""Love On Arrival"", and ""Big Wheels In The Moonlight."" However, the whole record was excellent and VERY enjoyable. I recommend this to anyone who's a fan of country music, like myself! Please buy it today, you will not regret it!"
3,Where's the other hits?,"Yes, Dan Seals is fantastic! Yes, he should of had many more hits, but one major song is misssing... Meet Me in Montana. Look at his other C.D. you'll find ALL the good ones there."
4,Great Session Player,"This is a fine album from the mid/late 1970's. It is something of a mixture of styles which is indicative of many albums from that era. I've seen Mr. Finnigan in many different bands since that era and have enjoyed them all. Where Mike absolutely cooks is in the Blues/R'n'B area, both as a singer and a Hammond B-3 player. I saw him playing in Etta James' band a few years ago; Mike and Etta did a duet that tore the roof off the theater! If you've seen him with the Phantom Blues Band, you know what I'm saying. Thus, my only criticism of this album is that there is not enough Blues or R'n'B for my taste. Still a good listen..."
5,Inspirational,I checked this book out from the library and then purchased it for Kindle before I ever finished the library book. I found it to be truly inspirational and informative as I work on my thesis on my own family's rural Southern roots. I marked so many pages and quotes that spoke to me and that I'll refer to over and over again.
1,"Buy something else, not worth the hassel","The vacuum worked extremely well for the first two months and then the first wheel broke under the canister. After the wheel was super glued back on, another wheel broke under the brush heads. Now after seven months of owning the Euro Vac, the power will not adjust the air flow.Just to add another note. I called the customer service number to have the unit repaired and the company out sources its call center to India and it is extremely hard to understand the service reps. On top of all these problems, Euro Vac requires the customer to pay $9.85 to have the product ship to New York to be repaired.Needless to say, this item went into the trash and I purchased a Kirby."
2,Nice when it isn't broken,"When it works, it works great. In the first few months of use the floor attachment lost a wheel (which holds a pin in place which in turn holds the whole attachment together). The motor surges when set to ""max"" so I have to use a slightly lower setting. It is guaranteed, but you have to pay to ship the item to the manufacturer and included a check for about $20 to have it sent back to you. My advise: spend more money and buy a better model and brand."
1,Stay away from it.,"After having Eureka for 14 years, got this one without research. Quality is very poor. Additional bags order took a month directly from the company (as they were not included as specified). And...by the time I got the bags, the hose broke off! I am not even trying to fix it. Cheaper to throw it out."
1,I should have listened...,"I bought this vacuum cleaner in April '03 and it died in November, a completely catestrophic event of undetermined cause. Up to that time it seemed reliable, though as another critic noted the variable suction quickly lost it's ability to regulate and I had a strong surge or next to nothing. Now, I can only say it's a waste of money. I too have been unsuccessful getting through to the customer service number (average wait time 30 min!) so I suppose they keep having an ""unexpectedly high call volume"". Use the price of this vacuum on a nice Kirby or some other reliable brand."
2,not reliable,"we used it for little over 2 yars - it was OK, nothing oustanding as far as performance. it's pretty ""plastic"" feel, with parts attached not too well one to eachother - the latches, dust bag door, etc.- power brush broke in a few month- the hose got torn in 2 years- motor burned out 2.5 years (I think it's because bag position aren't secured enough - a couple of times it fell off the hose inside the canister and dust+air blew bypassing the bag wich decreased motor life)"
2,no bags available,"It's a nice vacuum for bare floors and area rugs. It's lightweight and easy to handle. However, it's next to IMPOSSIBLE to purchase bags for it. If you don't mind emptying the cloth bag, it's okay, but if you want disposable ones, forget about it."
2,Lynne,"Suction works very well, but doesn't pick up on pile carpet well because there isn't a motor turning the brush. Retractable cord doesn't retract without assistance. The bags are extremely small, need to be changed often."
1,Total Disappointment,"I received this product as a gift. After a few uses, the wheel of the floor attachment fell off. The next thing to go was the suction, it became so weak after only three weeks of use. Tried to get warranty service but was unable to because I do not have the original receipt. Contacted Amazon and got no help. The vacuum still looked brand new so I couldn't bring myself to junk it. Kept it in the closet hoping the suction would miraculously come back on its own. Checked it the other day, and when I lifed up the hose, it broke in half. Have never seen anything of such poor quality. Made in China, go figure... I would give it 0 star, if 0 star were offered as a rating option. Buy this product at your own risk."
1,Don't bother...,"It barely has suction, the bags are tiny, it doesn't work at all on carpet or rugs and it broke within the first five uses. Don't bother with this one...."
1,A waste of money,This vacuum works great for maybe the first month but after that there is no suction at all and it starts falling apart. You really get what you pay for. I know 3 other people that have had this vacume and they have had the same problems.
2,Terrible on carpet,"I really hate the carpet attachment on this vacuum. The suction is not sufficent to make the brush spin very well on even short carpet. And I have to take the carpet attachment apart at least twice a month to clean all the junk out so that the brush will spin at all. On the other hand, if you have hard wood floors, and do not live in a huge place (the cord is not very long) it should be great for you."
4,Performed as expected,This HEPA machine is the cheapest and smallest way to work safe with lead dust on small jobs. It will attach to planners and sanders with an outlet. The vacumn power will clear almost all of the dust and you only need a mask to be 100%(+/-) safe. The only issue will be finding HEPA paper dust bags. No luck so far but the machine comes with a cloth bag which can't be to HEPA specs. The bags advertised with it here won't fit The Shark. If you do use the cloth bag wear a very good air mask.
2,Save your money!,"The first Shark I owned had problems with the suction control within a year. The company sent me a replacement Shark. Now the retractable cord retracts on its own; and again, within a year's time, the Shark's suction control has stopped working. Not to mention the bags are very hard to find. Use your money towards the purchase of another vacuum."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I've had this vacuum for two days now and am pleasantly surprised by it. Having had some truly awful vacuums (includind a terrible Fantom up-right), I was expecting the worse. I have a lot of different surfaces - rugs, wood floors, old-fashioned radiators, lots of molding - in my house, as well as a Pomeranian dog and a parakeet. This vacuum is proving quite capable of dealing with just about everything. It has good power and suction and is easy to use. I like the re-usable cloth bag and was surprised at its capacity. The unit is light, easy to carry and move with. The only complaint I can think of...I would have liked a longer crevice tool. Otherwise, this is a great little vacuum and a very good value."
2,"pitifully made, but suction not bad","The wheels fell off the attachment within DAYS of buying it. Used super glue- now sort of ok. Cord is too short so added extension- again only ok. Vacuum gets ""tired"" and quits if you use it too long at a time. Works again after about an hour(??).Now, I can't get bags anywhere. Just not worth it-best cheapo canister vac I ever had was the Mighty Mite. It finally died after 10+ years of overuse and abuse."
1,Current DVD mastering plays reels out of sequence; makes hash of story.,Abysmal mastering on the DVD I saw places the reels way out of order. The only thing to do is to fast forward to the performance sequences and ignore the drama completely. Incoherent is the nice word. Shame on the publisher.
2,Too Much Sex - Not enough Music!!,This ego driven womanizer left me cold. The film quality was bad. There was not enough history which would haveincluded exerpts from his great operas. Overall not very satisfactory.
3,Entertaining;but,"Entertaining;but a stretch of facts. For a film that,s over 50 yrs,the production,especially cinematography is excellent."
2,Not what I expected,"These are not my favorite cliff brand snack. I was expecting something more like a gummy bear taste and they tasted nothing like that. No one in my family enjoyed these. If I had to do it all over again, I think I would have purchased one at the store first, to try them and then order the big pack later if I liked it, or in my case, just not purchase it at all."
3,Does the job,"This product does the job but it's kind of bulky for a runner. I use it mostly when cycling instead. If the bloks are cooler, they are much harder to get down. I prefer the margarita one."
3,Good Product,"I think these function similar to carb gels with one exception: you have to chew them. I find that they stick to my teeth (which I hate, no matter what type of food I'm eating). I have only used them prior to a workout, not during. I found that they are fine to use before a workout. However, if I had to chew them while trying to stay on pace during a run I don't think I'd like it (it's too much effort when you are trying to push yourself during a workout). In addition, I think they would be good to use if I were cycling instead of running because I'm able to chew more easily while cycling.In short, I give the Clif Shot Bloks 3 out 5 stars because you have to chew them. I think they taste good but they seem unnecessary given that you can simply buy a carb gel and not worry about chewing anything."
4,Better than peeing,"I kickbox, and drink a sports drink prior to my workouts. Unfortunately, this meant having to take breaks to relieve myself often. I tried SHOT BLOKS with the sole purpose of reducing my ""potty breaks."" And it worked! I still drink plenty of water during my workouts, but these give me the electrolytes I need without filling me liquid.They taste like gummi chews, and all my friends like them as well. Be warned tho, the Black Cherry flavor does have a shot of caffeine. Those looking to avoid caffeine should go with the Lemon-Lime flavor.On a side note, these are also great hangover helper, too!"
4,Good Taste,This is a great product to get you through you workouts if you need a little extra energy. Strawberry is great tasting.
3,"Taste awful, but supply quick energy","I really love Clif products, but think the Bloks are my least favorite from Clif. They functionally work well by supplying some quick energy; and are convenient since you can take a specific amount based on your needs and store the rest for later. These are especially convenient in my climate (high humidity year round).My problem is they taste terrible. My kids tried them and spit them out within seconds. I bought the cherry flavor so not sure if this one is especially bad.I'll continue to stick with the energy gels, Clif bars and Clif Protein bars as the right mixture before, during and after intense exercise sessions. These Bloks have been sitting in my cupboard for months and thinking of giving them away."
4,Shot Blocks work for me,"This is just a simple case of having the right flavor, right format, and right price to make it perfect for my workouts. No messy sticky gel on your fingers, easy to fit in your hand or a small pocket. The caffeine is a good bonus.I like Black Cherry, Margarita and Cola flavored the best.Cheers,"
4,"tasty, great way to replenish electrolytes","margarita type are pretty awesome way to take in electrolytes during a workout. taste good (though better when you're exercising than not), and the 3x salt makes them great for workouts in the heat."
3,"Work Great, taste not so much","I used these blocks training for the Chicago Marathon. The first few times, I enjoyed the taste, but was a little put off by how big and chewy they were.The package says that each package is two servings of blocks. However, there is not a very good way to store the second half of the bag while on your run. The remaining blocks got even stickier than they started out.Also, they were somewhat hard to eat while running. They were just too big and too chewy.I have switched to the Jelly Belly Sport Beans, which I find better tasting and somewhat easier to eat due to their smaller size."
4,Shot Bloks really work,"Strawberry Shot Bloks really work. They are a great supplement to other workout stuff I am taking. They taste great and are good to take at the beginning of a workout and again halfway through for a quick boost. To me, it's like a quick shot of Gatorade. I highly recommend."
5,Great for long runs,"As a new-ish runner, I find that on runs longer than 1 hour, these shot blocks are very helpful.They are not too soft nor too hard. They do not melt even if they are in my back pocket right next to my skin. The taste isn't too sugary which is great if you are not a fan of gatorade/propel/sugary stuff as I am. I find that with a little bit of water, I can chew these and the flavor does not stay too long afterwards. For me, I will take these before I start to crash and imagine my own little Zelda-like life bar being filled up.Highly recommended if you do not like to rip open gu packs while running. The only thing I do mind is that I have to open the pack up before I start to run. Sometimes its a bit much to have to stop, rip it open with my teeth, and then keep going. I've also found that you can even keep them up to a week and they will still be good even if a little more chewy than normal."
3,Cliff Bloks chews pretty good,"I thought these blok chews where pretty good. They tasted good, not too gooey or chewy on the teeth. I did have to eat the entire pack (6 chews) to really get a buzz. It's like eating some fruit chews of some kind. Eat the entire pack you will get moving for sure. btw i had the cherry w/ caffeine. Not sure if i'll ever buy it again, it didn't impress me that much where i'd say it's a keeper, and it had a 2 week expiration, so i was forced to eat a pack a day."
3,Wrong flavor,Originally I did order lemon-lime but item arrived as a citrus flavor. Which was quite tasty but wrong description on web site
1,Cliff indigestion,"I have tried several Cliff products over the years, none with good results. For whatever reason, these things do not sit well in my stomach. Perhaps it is all of the years of living on Mac n Cheese but these organic and ""easy to digest"" products are all but. I tried the Bloks at a pre-race expo and the thing sat like a rock in my gut. They taste all right but wow are they tough to digest."
2,Clif Shot Bloks,"Was not nearly as pleasant as other similar products we have purchased. We were very disappointed in the consistency & taste of this product. We couldn't even convince our work-out fanatic friends to try liking this product. Certainly this product could be improved in flavor & consistency! Needless to say, we didn't notice any energy boost[as product claims]once we did get the shot blocs chewed & consumed. We won't be buying this again, but will continue to seach for similar better tasting items."
5,Great Product,These are great for long rides on the bike and also triathlons. I use them for both and they are very convenient and easy to eat.
5,Great product,"I've used these for biking and running, and they are a great way to carry energy. I used to mix up some gatorade for long rides or runs, but now I just bring some of these Gels along instead.They are easy to eat on the go (if you pre-open the package before going out on a ride).I like all of the flavor's I've tried so far. They aren't quite as tasty as gummybears, but they have a similar texture."
5,excellent,Great experience...I received the item as describe. and on time.will do business again.competitive pricesExcellent costumer support.
3,Energy blok?,"These seem to work as an energy boost during a long run. I usually stop after about 5 miles and chew 2 of them with about 8 ounces of water which is a must because the directions clearly state to drink water while ingesting.However, I have to make sure to remove them from the package and put them in a water-proof bag somewhere on the route I am running. The package is too difficult to open, otherwise, and once they get wet they turn to soup. Would be difficult to carry with you if you were running in a race unless you like running with a fanny pack."
5,Great,"These are delicious, great size and shape you can stick them on your bike and eat them during a race, good fast energy."
4,gummy and flavorful,I love the flavor of these and the gummy. helps add some energy but they don't really have anything to them.
2,"Tasty, but didn't give much energy.","These have a weird consistency, but the taste is otherwise OK (I had the Cherry). Not delicious, not repulsive, but I wouldn't buy these again for the flavor.Also -- they didn't provide much energy. We used these while we were putting furniture together, and ended up falling asleep on the couch. Tried them later for a bike ride, but no discernible effects again."
4,Great taste and convenient,I was very surprised at how much I like the taste of these Bloks. For this type product the flavor usually suffers but not these. I buy them regularly. I believe they have some caffeine but it must not be much. I'm sensitive to caffeine but don't notice any caffeine jitters with the product.
2,Ball joint failure,"Bought for replacing on 2004 Explorer. Needed to get special tool to install and took several hours to remove old and press in new. All seemed fine until about one month after installing, the boot on one of the ball joint came out from under the retaining clip allowing dirt and sand in and grease out. Had no information on warranty, how to contact company or how to replace failed product. Not practical to remove product and return since truck will be out of commission. The process was such that now it isn't worth pursuing and won't order these again. Will order factory replacement arms/ball joint to repeat the process. Not happy about these ball joints."
4,"A huge hit, but maybe short-lived","My three-year-old son received this toy as a birthday gift and it was the hit of his party. He and his friends took turns running the cars down the track and laughed their heads off for a good thirty minutes. On the down side, it hasn't really held his attention for long since then. He still occasionally runs the cars on his own, but mostly plays with it when friends come over. It's good for teaching kids to take turns, well constructed and very cute. Ultimately though, toys that allow for more variation by changing the tracks to create a new set up get more play time. That said, it's very attractive, so I don't mind in the least if it just sits on the shelf most of the time."
3,Fun but not too interesting for long,"My mother-in-law has a similar but even more fun version of this toy that she bought in Amish country. My two-year-old son loved it at her house, so I bought this hoping he would enjoy it just as much. But the cars don't do enough switch-backs for him and he quickly loses interest in it. He plays with it for just a few minutes each day, but not for more than that, I'm sad to say."
