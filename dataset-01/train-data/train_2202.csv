5,"Although missing a few, this collection is pure perfection","When you really watch this collection (meaning not skipping any of the videos), you truly get a sense of what an amazing artist Madonna is & all of the talent & creativity she brings to the music industry. There's NO music video like ""Take A Bow"" with all it's glamour & detail. And most artists would be scared to do something as bleak & haunting as ""Frozen."" You also get a sense of how much she has changed throughout the decade. Calculated or not, no other artist has ever been as fresh or successful. Many steps above the rest--a beautiful collection."
1,I'm dissatisfied,"I am very unhappy with Warner Bros. decision to remove Erotica from the video collection. Now, there is nothing on this video collection that makes it worth buying. Any of these videos can be seen on any given day on MTV or VH1. Without Erotica, this a pretty boring colletion. I won't pay for it."
3,Madonna 93:99,Excellent! Performance art at its finest! An Audio and visual treat for all Madonna fans!!
3,We Need A Complete Madonna Video Collection!,"It's great to get some of her videos, but we would love a complete video collection! Please release all of your vids, Madonna!"
4,Madonna's Video Evolution through the '90's !,"This is a collector's item for any true Madonna fan as it showcases her chimerical image changes through the 1990's. However, I missed some videos like, ""You'll See"", ""I Want You"", ""I'll Remember"" and the Evita videos as well. I was wondering why they were not included in this video collection. My favorite video is ""Rain"" with its artistically simple yet elegant Japanese direction, even the song was way ahead of its time. More Power to the Artist of the New Millennium!"
5,Madonna's Vid Companion to GHV2...,"...with the exception of her recent Music CD and the notorious ""Justify My Love"" video, this has about all the same jams on it. They are visually stunning cinematography and design that makes the vids 'stand alone' pieces of artistic creation and endeavor...some are like Dali or Miro meets Lynch. My favorites are ""Bedtime Story"", and ""Nothing Really Matters""...even if you don't like Madonna, they are fun to watch."
3,where is Erotica? why not in Dolby Digital 5.1 ?,It's missing 2 things so I cannot give more then 3 stars. It's missing the Erotica video and does not have Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.
4,"Madonna, queen of videos!","Although some of the best videos were excluded from this collection, Madonna still shines through her other video's. Videos such as Human Nature and Frozen top the list. This video collection truly shows Madonna's work from 93' - 99'!"
5,E R O T I C A,"With or without Erotica (which is a shame), Madonna's rank as the most innovative and risque pop superstar is unswerved! Just the fact that FEVER, FROZEN, and BEDTIME STORY are in this video collection makes it worthy of a five star."
4,Great video - No soundtrack videos,"As many others have said, I was dissapointed that Erotica was not included as many people have never seen it. I think the reason that all of her soundtrack videos (with one exception) were not included is because they all have scenes of the movie in them and since the studios own the rights to these scenes, they can forbid them from being SOLD in any format. The Beautiful Stranger video (from Austin Powers) does not include any scenes from the movie which is why it's included here. Hopefully someday Maverick will see it fit to release all her videos from Immaculate Collection and this new one plus her other non-soundtrack clips."
3,How could they leave Erotica OUT!,"This collection is great, but like everyone else here, I believe it's a great dissapointment not to have Erotica as part of the collection. They need to release a limited R rated version for those of us who would like to see this video."
2,Do they know what artistic integrity is?,"I'm MAD at this. How can they leave out the EROTICA video. Do they think we're all 10 years old!?! And the fact that Madonna is letting WB do this just drives me crazy! Is she getting old and puritan? At least, they could release two different versions of this DVD, one with the EROTICA video and one without it, just like when they released the two versions of the EROTICA album. PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE!!!"
3,Where's EROTICA??,"I would just like to echo the sentiments of some of the other reviews here. I think that my leaving off the ""Erotica"" video, Warner Bros is leaving off one of the biggest milestones in Madonna's career. Some people have NEVER seen the video and have waited years for it, and had expected this to be their chance."
4,no more erotica,"Well well it looks like madonna has done it again. finally a long awaited sequel to her 1990 video clloection ;however, it does have it's disappointments. videos like erotica, you'll see, deeper and deeper and i want you were all sorely overlooked. erotica was orginally in the package but got bumped for 2 reasons-first maverick didn't want a advirsory sticker attached( this is madonna?!) secondly the power of goodbye was set in it's place. my point...the video only clocks in at 68 mins so why not add every video and show a complete representation of her amazing work. it is still worth picking up because the package does include frozen. secret, bad girl, and the unreleased drowned world\substitute for love... it is well worth it."
4,not enough!,the perfect collection should be like this1 - Deeper And Deeper2 - Bad Girl3 - Fever4 - Rain5 - Secret6 - Take A Bow7 - Bedtime Story8 - Human Nature9 - You Must Love Me10 - I Want You11 - You'll See12 - Love Don't Live Here Anymore13 - Frozen14 - Ray Of Light15 - Drowned World/Substitute For Love16 - The Power Of Goodbye17 - Nothing Really Matters18 - Beautiful Stranger
3,Missing Links,"No one knows how to make a music video like Madonna. And no one knows how to package a video collection like Madonna. So, why did she omit such stand-out productions like ""Erotica,"" ""You'll See,"" ""Deeper and Deeper,"" ""You Must Love Me"" and-- reaching back-- ""This Used to Be My Playground?"" I expected a full playlist, but will have to live with my grainy VHS copies for these titles (if the draining ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" video made it through the cutting process, why didn't ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina""?). Of course, the body of work is stellar, but why stop short of a collective home run? I am dissappointed. But, knowing Madonna, she will probably issue a limited re-release with all these titles included. And I'll probably buy it."
3,Good Book but no answers to Problems,"This is a well laid out book, with very good examples and problems. My reason for giving it a 3 star rating is the absence of answers to numerical problems. I had purchased this book as a self help improvement process in the Capital Budgeting process. But if there are no answers to the problems, than a person does not know how effective was the learning.The book is organized well, and has good examples and explainations."
4,The Epitome of Fusion!,"You will really get into this if you like your jazz very rocky, or rock very jazzy. I would compare Gamalon with Return To Forever or Spyro Gyra. George Puleo's guitar work is second to none, and the same can be said about Ted Rhinehart's drumming. each player is indeed a master at his instrument, each track polished to perfection.As A fellow Buffalonian, I surely would consider this band one of the best to come out of the area ever. Sadly, there is not a big market locally for fusion and currently no radio station that caters to that audience, or else this lp would have topped the charts."
4,"Very good shoes, just not sports shoes","Bought two pairs of those -- the first at Nordstrom, the second online. Both have been very comfortable, the stretchable part helping a lot with comfort. Satisfied, with one caveat. Extended use while standing/walking (e.g., lecturing for 6-7 hours or walking briskly for a couple of hours) results in pain to the shins. I suspect it is the angle, as the heels are rather high (thought this was a plus, until the pain popped up a couple of times).Bottom line: high quality, regret that they have been discontinued."
3,Multifidus strenthening to prevent back pain,"I am so excited when I see one of our members write such an informative book for the public. I read the book in one day. I too, am a physical therapist with a manual therapy background. I believe to the average ""joe"" this book will be helpful and encouraging. I would have liked ""live"" pictures, and more of a description of the multifidus. By strengthening the multifidus muscle, what movements does that help with and why? How does the spine become more stable by strengthening these muscles? These are questions I would have liked more specifically addressed. I glad he gave credit to Stanley Paris,PT,PH.D., whom has been advocating these exercises for over 10 years!I think it's a good book for anyone not in the physical therapy profession as it answers most of the back pain questions."
4,the little know multifidus muscle,"I had 2 herniated discs. Went through chiro, massage, p.t., cortisone injections....then i read this book and began following the exercises in it. The MacKenzie method DID NOT work for me, it only created more pain. This book was extremely helpful to me. Surprisingly, my massage therapist recommended it, not my physical therapist, orthopeadic, or chiropractor. I am fully healed without surgery and running marathons! I recommend this book to any average person who wants to have a better understanding of how to strengthen your back and core!"
5,Unbelievable... a borderline miracle.... 10++ stars,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! I had back surgery 2 years ago (L1-L2 thru L3-L4 lumbar diskectomy) to relieve severe lower back pain and sciatica pain in the left leg. Although the surgery relieved the sciatica, regularly every 4-6 weeks I subsequently had recurring ""episodes"" which took 2-3 weeks to subside. I was walking, swimming, stretching, etc., all to no avail. Skelaxin and Mobic became my best friends during this period. A random Google search turned up this book by Jim Johnson (and the excellent 8/23/06 Amazon review by G. Brennan of LA,CA), and I decided ""what the hell"".... Bottom Line: It works. Period. I bought 2.5 lb. ankle weights, do the recommended exercises < 10 minutes/day every day, and 3-4 weeks later, my back pain has disappeared and the numbness in my left heel has disappeared 80%. BUY THIS BOOK. IT'LL BE THE BEST $10 YOU HAVE EVER SPENT IN YOUR LIFE."
3,So-so...,"This book can be summarized in one paragraph, ""The multifidus muscle runs up the spine and the part that's at waist level *may* be causing your back pain. To strengthen, start on all fours and extend your right leg and left arm horizontally. Hold for ones second then extend the left leg and right arm for one second. Repeat twenty times every other day. For further strengthening, add 1-5 lb. ankle weights."" There, I just saved you 12 bucks! Everything else in the book is feel-good fluff or general information which may or may not have merit but you're interested in curing your back pain and not in generalities, right? The author could have at least thrown in a few nice diagrams, the ones in the book are so simple and amateurish that I'd be embarrassed to put them in a book I'd written."
4,Good for giving you info on research,"Most of this book gives alot of research info about what is true and not true about back pain. There is actually very little on actual exercises except for the 3 he describes which are excellent as there is one for every level of back pain you are in. I would have liked more exericises but what I do appreciate is that he points out once you reach your level of strength, you don't have to do them every day to maintain it."
2,The Solution???,"I don't think some of the exercises illustrated in this book are appropriate for all patients, especially some of those with lumbar radiculopathy (or spinal stenosis). Exercises #4 and 5# involve a patient lying in prone (on stomach) and have them perform alternating lower extremity or upper/lower extremity lifts. Many individuals attempting #4-5 exercises at home will likely go into lumbar extension (especially if they forgo the pillow under their pelvis), which will close down the foraminal openings where the nerve roots exit. If this individual has an inflammed nerve root, he or she will likely experience an increase in radicular symptoms (numbness and tingling)."
5,Pretty Good,"So I've been doing the excercises as this book suggested and it's been great. I hardly ever get back pain anymore. My back pain is stiff lower back and I've also has disketomy done too. Ever since I did their suggested work out I truly have not had any incidents of back pain. I would've liked to see this book suggest more excercises. It gives out only a few excercises, however those excercises are very effective. The book also talks to much about studies, and other insignificant topics."
4,great gift idea,"Every year I would pick out a different page a day for my dad. He loves word jumbles, crosswords and such. This calendar he now requests every year. Some days he brings the pages home to share with others. A great gift for the intellectual."
4,Nice Calendar,"Interesting calendar which helps you learn a word every day of the year. However, most of the words may not be really suitable for normal conversations."
3,Puerile calendar,"Instead of find it stimulating I'm finding it purile (so far, we're only in January)."
4,Excellent explanations but maybe a few too many unusable words,"I was hoping for more words that I am familiar with but not sure of the meaning, or that would help me expand my daily vocabulary. In this calendar, there are just a few too many words that if used in conversation may come across as sciolistic...hmmm, I may need to rethink that.But the explanation and examples, and especially the history of the word on the back of the page, are interesting and comprehensive."
3,Well...,"I don't really like the book to much. Here is why:1. Some of the pictures are backwards and are not in order. For example, on a page talking about 1981, on the same page there would be a picture from 1975.2. The ""stories behind every song"" are only opinions.3. Robert Scott doesn't sound like much of an ABBA fan.If you are looking for a great ABBA book, you should get ""From ABBA to Mamma Mia"" or ""ABBA the Book."""
1,Complete and utter waste of money,"I purchased this book thinking it would be an in depth look into the creation of ABBA's songs. Instead it is an unnecessary book reviewing their songs and at times can be quite nasty in it's comments. I'm not sure what the author of this book was trying to achieve, but if he was planning on alienating and ticking off ABBA's fans, mission accomplished!"
4,Another strong Gage book...,"Ferringon continues to make me a fan of his work. This novel is populated with fewer strange characters than ""Flinch"" and is a less personal story (I guess any story where you suspect your brother of being a serial keller is personal as in Flinch)...yet it works. The murder mysteries here take some great turns. Jimmy is far more settled in this book and seems happier. I was sad to see Jane Holt and Desmond relgated to smaller roles. Same with Rollo, although he was around. This was much more about the case and less about these wonderful characters. Still, the mystery is a dandy and Hollywood again is shown to be a place of murder and redemption."
3,Just a Bit Twisty,"A readable but unremarkable story set in the pit of all excess, Hollywood.This is not the first book with the Jimmy Gage protagonist, and it would be helpful to start at the beginning. The story contains a few plot twists to keep it interesting, but they could have been more artfully done. The Killer's ultimate motivation is never made clear. In addition, the protagonist's coup de main's are executed just a bit too easily.This book is OK for the beach."
3,"Still great, but not as accessible as the Koln or the Paris","Let's put it this way: if the Koln Concert was Keith Jarrett's master degree thesis, then the Sun Bear Collection is his PhD. It's more elaborated, but also a lot less electrifying than the Koln. Listening through all the five concerts (plus the encores), it takes a lot of time and patience to spot the moments where Jarrett shows his full genious. However, for the aficionados who can't get enough from his stuff it is still fascinating to study his work in detail. Let's face ist: on a piano he's the Jesus!"
4,Monumental melodies,"Certainly designed for the more disciplined listener, this is nonetheless solo piano improvisation at its near-finest articulation. The five dates all have their share of dragging and spellbinding moments, but separately command intense respect and worthwhile replay value."
4,Great show.Closed captions only. No extras.,"As always - great show. Pity there are no subtitles, only closed captions (from season three onward), which not all DVD players know how to handle. I have to watch it on my laptop.It's a real shame that such a monumental show got no worthy extras."
5,Back to the good old days of comedy & relevent TV!,"This whole series of ""All in the Family"" is the best thing I have come accross in ages. I just wish they wouldn't have waited so long to release all the seasons. I still bnelieve that this whole show is the best thing that ever hit the TV screen. Nothing since has even come close including ""cheers"", ""Mash"" or ""Fraiser."""
2,Okay,"First of all, I got this at my local craft store for half the price. Second of all, I guess the quality of this set depends on what you want. It comes with ONE scratchbord which already has the image printed on it, so you essentially use the craft tool to trace it and.... that's it. It says that there is a practice board but it's actually a 1X2 inch piece of board identical to the only other one that comes in the kit - pretty lame. If all you're looking for is to trace someone else's art work the finished product does look nice, and it is good quality scratchbord, otherwise buy something else."
5,Bad Reviewers should actually read the booklet,"The Chamber of Commerce is an organization which most knowledgable people know about, and can separate from the Department of Commerce. All the people giving this bad reviews are acting like it is some pretend organization which was made up to appear to be part of the government just to give this booklet legitimacy. Furthermore, the booklet makes it clear that not all environmentalists agree with the extreme views that are expressed there, and suggested that sincere enviromentalists should make more an effort to separate themselves from the radical element."
4,Some priceless moments,"A great effort and it's hard to beat that organ - not enough organ work anymore. Nice varied stuff, great grooves, and frost on my sunglasses might be the best song of the year."
1,amazingly disappointed,I have been a fan of TDM for close to 20 years. Nutrition was the only good track on this tribute. A monkey hitting a microphone with a rock could have done better covers. Amazingly disappointed.
5,Awesome!,"Not much to say- much better than the first disc. If you liked any other Full Metal Panic, you should like this one. Fantastic!"
4,McLovin,"Wow is this guy talented! This is a great cd and I guarantee this band will make it big. I've already seen the cds on the front rack at best buy. The soothing sound of the piano mixed with the sweet soulful vocals of Jon McL really bring a new energy into the singer songwriter scene. He's also great live. Definitely pick this up if you are a fan of John Mayer, Dave Matthews, etc."
5,Shocking Greatness,"We saw Jon open for Kelly Clarkson and he is absolutley amazing. I love to listen to great piano players and it is wonderful to find an artist who sings well, writes music, and is an amazing piano player.It is always great to a concert for a singer that you love but even better to discover a new one in the process. Bought the CD based on the live performance and it does not disappoint. I think he tackles issue that every human has experienced and he does it in such a pleasing way. I was giving Reba Duets for Christmas but instead I am giving this.If you get a chance to check him out in concert don't miss it."
5,Inspiring even when downbeat.,"Jon Mclaughlin was someone I never got into until this year. I've heard of him before this I think, maybe on Last.fm but never took the plunge. I'm glad I have his music in my life now. Throughout the CD, Jon stays real with you the whole time. There are more mid-tempos and slow songs than there are upbeat tracks but all of the songs are at least a 4-star affair (out of 5).My favorite songs in no order are INDUSTRY, FOR YOU FROM ME, ANTHEM FOR AMERICAN TEENAGERS, PEOPLE, AMELIA'S MISSING and PERFECT. I especially love the last 4 I listed.I will MOST DEFINITELY be buying his next album when close to its release. Don't sleep on him, people! He's definitely not as popular as he should be. His sophomore effort,OK Nowis almost as good as this too so check it out!4.75 stars (or a 9.5/10)DOWNLOAD:""Anthem For American Teenagers""""Perfect""""Amelia's Missing""""People"" &""Industry"" or ""For You From Me"""
5,Jon McLaughlin,This cd absolutely rocks. It is so varied. I have told everyone about it. I love his voice! This cd is the best!
1,Truly bad Yoga,"This is quite possibly the worst yoga program I have ever seen. There is no instruction for the yoga asanas instead the voice over goes on and on using vapid statements about Kabbalah.I figured that there would be some mention of Kabbalah in the program, due to the title. However, I also expected there to be a solid yoga practice with proper cueing. When the voice over actually cued a movement it was often behind the performers.There was no instruction on moving into or out of a pose and the poses where not held for equal amounts of time on both sides of the body.There are so many good yoga DVDs available and I suggest that no one waste their money on this one."
5,Good DVD,"Although I enjoy the Ambitious beginners more. I really do like this DVD as well. It's a nice practice but it probably more for those who have experience doing yoga.I also agree with the other reviewer that I hate it when DVDs are too cued. If you've practiced yoga before you don't need the 'turn your foot 45 degrees' type of instruction, it becomes redundant.Although I like to create my own yoga sequences more this series is the best that I've tried. Especially since I do not like flow yoga."
5,Jump'n blues bass,"An excellent collection of bass lines in tab and standard notation. Arranged in the style of many of the most popular bassists in the genre,giving one example for each of a dozen or so artists.The included CD is arranged with the bass on one side so you can practice with the band by turning the balance full left channel."
4,An OK book,"It was a bit hard to follow at parts and the rituals we're hard to perform (you needed to memorize alot). It also seemed a bit to new age for anything actualy ""Egytpian Magick"" It was more ""Egytpain Astral Travel"" All together it was a pretty good book and very interesting. I recomend it for soemone who is exsperianced in magick. It could be very hard for a beginer or novice."
3,Not what I expected...,"Well, I had purchased this book thinking that is was a beginners book and would explain all the essentials of Egyptian Magick, and to my suprise it was not. It was a very good book though, I would recomend a different book for beginners."
5,100% and MORE!,"THIS FIRM IS ACE. THE BOOK CAME AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION. I WOULD ORDER ANYTIME, ANYWHERE FROM THIS FIRM. THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
2,Not a leading product,"I decided to purchase Street Atlas 2003 because of my frutstration with GPS tracking in Microsoft's Streets & Trips 2002 (which updates position only every 15 secs). The GPS tracking capabilities of Delorme's product looked good. However, I was disappointed in the mapping quality compared to Microsoft's product. For example, Street Atlas shows my home location (based on address) at the end of my street - not acceptable. Microsoft's product is more accurate in pinpointing the location of an address. The quality of the maps was also disappointing. The user interface is non standard and non-intuitive. The requirement to have the CD in the laptop in order to see maps is not acceptable. Note that Delorme offers a 30-day money back guarantee, which I appreciate. I will take advantage of it."
2,Long time user in Connecticut,"I agree completely with user from Cleveland. Delorme took a fabulous interface (Version 8.0 / 9.0) and completely ruined it. This is the one piece of software that I have never failed to upgrade immediately since the program's introduction years ago. For the first time, I am sorry that I did. SA 2003 is much slower, the Windows interface is gone, and the graphics quality is degraded. This is change for the sake of change, without regard to a previously very loyal user base. It's hard for me to understand Delorme's thinking with this one.Like Cleveland, I have reinstalled a previous version."
1,Disappointed,"I've been a fan of Delorme Street Atlas since the early versions. I was very happy with the previous version, it did everything I wanted, was easy to use, and was fast. I bought Street Atlas 2003 mainly to get the newest map information. It was a huge disappointment - it's slow, you can't select certain states to save on your hard drive (it's all or nothing), I don't care for the map display (you have to zoom way in to see street names), you can no longer select certain areas to avoid, and worst of all the automatic routing often gives nonsense reslults (I've found that the program thinks that some interstate off-ramps are local roads and will go out of it's way to route around them - the results are sometimes just plain goofy)."
1,Wake up Delorme Your customers are not happy,"Delorme had a great product, Street Atlas, but then they decided to give up a winning interface and put on the clunky 3-D topo interface... result... They lost me as a customer. This product is slow, inaccurate, and difficult to use compared to the ""classic"" Street Altas. They laid an egg. Too bad. Guess I'll have to get the Microsoft product for updated streets and points of interest."
2,Streets missing,"This new version lacks some of the usefull tools to mark locations that prior versions have, plus there are streets missing from prior versions. And customer service is none existent."
1,"Buggy on Windows 2000, Slow on 98 - 9.0 MUCH Better","I first installed this on a W2K computer and got blank screens while the hard disk churned, lines and lines of file copy messages, etc. When it actually installed I couldn't get it to search.On 98, I did get it to search, but it was so slow, I thought I was doing it wrong so I tried several different things and it was still extremely slow. In Streets & Trips, I searched for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (no more information and got a list within a second or two). In Street Atlas, I gave it Washington, DC, too and I got an update on all the zip codes it was searching. .... I bought Street Atlas 9.0 today to compare. It was on sale ... and it isn't bad. I really like the one-way street markers.Oh yeah, the interface. I have worked with lots of different types of software (DOS, Windows, Mainframe) over the years and I would say that this interface is one of the top 5 WORST."
2,It will be disappointing to SA9 users,"Although there are some nice new features in SA2003, the program is slow and takes nearly all the Windows resources on my PC. The new ""interface"" is not an improvement (in my opinion) and the new file structure is clumsy.I printed trip planning maps in SA9 and was always satisfied. However, in SA2003 the corresponding maps are very hard to read (the font used is much smaller) and the ""strip"" maps no longer show the elapsed time or distance (making them almost useless).I plan to uninstall SA2003 and revert to SA9 and then look for another product with current map data and a ""useful"" interface."
1,I TRIED TO LIKE THIS BUT...,"Having been a Street Atlas USA customer since version 3, I was pretty committed to trying to like this. In addition, I own the Delorme Earthmate GPS which only works with Delorme products so I was REALLY committed. I tried... and I tried...Well... I'll be looking to replace the whole package. They ruined the Street Atlas franchise with this release. the user interface is awful, the features are now harder to use (if they still exist at all) and the program is slower. And the whole reason I bought it was because I thought the streets would be updated, but not in the areas that I was looking for!How does a company release an ""Update"" by removing features and making it worse???The one saving grace is that Delorme has a 30 day refund policy which I definately will be using.Oh... did I mention that I'm STILL waiting for them to respond to my email to the support department....If anyone has any recommendations for a good GPS/Mapping package, please post."
1,Don't use this on the road with your GPS,"If you plan to use this on the road with a GPS, man this is really bad.After getting on the road I recieved some really strange messages. Messages with directions that just don't make sense. Gives messages on major turns only if the road name changes. Late messages, for example after entering a ramp on to a freeway being notified that I would be there in a few seconds.No sense of being off route, keeps on giving directions as if on the plotted routeThus no automatic rerouting. So if you get off route you have to manually put it ""on track""Bottom line this is really usless with a GPS."
1,Forget About It,There are streets on these maps that have not existed in over 50 years if they ever did. Points of Interest are not located in the right place. They need to start over
4,The new UI is much better for laptops with touchscreen inter,"I have not used the previous versions, but in my opinion, the new UI will support much better laptops with touchscreen interface. I think that this is the right direction for the product. I am not impressed with the accuracy of the maps, but I can live with it."
2,Paint Shop Photo Album 5 Deluxe Edition,"Fast shipment, but the quality of product is poor. Images overlap each other without clearing up and becomes worse with continued use. Possible manufacturer's defect."
4,Great for mobile folks!,"This was a gift for my daughter in college. It is perfect because it looks great sitting on her bookshelf, but is easy to pick up and bring home with her. It makes great use of space. The only reason it doesn't get a 5-star rating is that it is a little cheaply made, but then the price is right, too. A little super glue tacked down those loose edges!"
1,not as pictured!,"This is not a jewelry box, it is a small coin purse jewelry holder. Very tiny and holds very little."
3,Eh!,Nothing special happened for me with this product but it does have a refreshing taste if you ad it to a glass of water.
2,Free to Speak: Overcoming Spasmodic Dysphonia,"I found the content to be mostly informative, but was slightly disappointed with the book. Based on the title, I was expecting more comprehensive rehabilitation material. There was some specific exercises and guidance, but I was expecting / hoping for a detailed program - start to finish - for a holistic rehabilitation model.The author does provide her contact information for more comprehensive and specific treatment, but that comes at an additional fee. Overall, I would rate the book as helpful."
3,Another List of Obvious Suggestions,"Although it always helps to read new ideas, or even old ones you haven't considered for a while, this book hardly lives up to its title or its promise. The so-called 'tactics' are nothing more than the common-sensical approaches that everyone ought to take in the dating game, and they don't so much give an upper hand to the reader, as render a level playing field to all involved. The self-help content of this book, therefore, is limited at best, but if you're a really socially uneducated or underdeveloped person, this book is as good a place as any to start. What's missing, is a more clear outline of HOW to bring the strategies in this book into practice. Bland advice like ""be confident"" is about as useful to the lonely and insecure partner-seeker, as would be, for example, ""grow wings"" or ""double your income."""
1,Might be good for women....,"This book is pretty much worthless for the average male looking to find a date. Most of the techniques would only work if the other person starts out receptive. Obviously, Sharyn has never seen the reaction most of us guys get when trying to meet women. They're usually downright rude. It's not as if one silly not-so clever line is going to make her interested. This book is up there with some other useless advice, such as ""just be yourself."" I wouldn't be surprised if Ms. Wolf thinks that women just want to find a ""nice guy!"" That's a laugh."
2,Stick with Naomi Wolf,"A feel-good book for women. Not as vague as some but the male input must have been gathered at one of those flirting seminars. Its very positive and well intentioned but this really is for women only. ""Think of yourself as a ray of sunshine melting ice"" ""Wear sultry hats"". Please."
2,Shallow as a puddle,"As many reviewers have pointed out, this book only cover the very basics. And even these in a highly debatable fashion, efficiency-wise. If you're a man and want something beyond the basics, I recommend Undercover Sex Signals, by Leil Lowndes. Despite the title, it's simply a book about nonverbal body language, that will be hundreds of times more useful, for practical purposes.On the other hand, I suggest you invest more in your own persona, and for that matter I recommend Robert Greene's books (48 laws, 33 strategies, art of seduction and the 50th law)."
2,Exciting but breaks no new ground,The title of this book is emotionally charged. Its content is at the level of common sense and lacks the jolt of the title. Its unsurprising suggestions will help the bold and leave the rest wanting. I recommend it for people who want their imagination fired up.
4,Good for inspiration,"This is really a great book as long as you don't read it as though it was a cookbook -- following instructions exactly. A lot of it is common sense, which is still useful because who uses their common sense when looking for a date?Mainly, though, it's the little stories and examples that make this a great book. Inspirational."
3,Not the cd to introduce you to G Crumb,"I am a Crumb fan, although a fan of the music (sound) not necessarily knowledgeable of his compositional methods, the technical aspects to his music, etc. For those who arent intostudying Crumbs music, just listening to it, I recommend ANY other of the Crumb cds on Bridge Records, all of which are fascinating and well recorded. Of the Bridge series on Crumb, this particular cd is a conspicuous disappointment."
4,Nice product,"There's nothing bad to really say about it. Easy to carry for a foot soldier like myself, folds up just like a reflector, 3 feet was big enough for what i needed to shoot. When unfolded its about waist level high.As far as diffusion.. its alright, if you know what your doing your gonna diffuse the lights anyway. If you dont know what your doing you'll still be fine.All in all its been great, probably a 5 star rating.... but i hardly 5 anything :-]"
1,Sometin wrong with this story,I have been given numerous misleading things about this tent. I was told by an photography store that the cubelite is a six sided litetent with a zippered front. Mine is missing the bottom pannel and does not have the vinyl insert for seamless backgrounds. It is also missing the diffuser that is shown in the Lastolite learning videos online.
3,mixed feelings,"While it was nice to see the softer side of ""Dubya"" for the material you're watching, it ran a bit long I think. And it definitely shows the liberal bias of the media. Alexandra Pelosi does a good job however of maintaining neutral ground, even though she does not hide her liberal leanings."
2,Pelosi Misses the Mark and the Zoom-Out Button,"Shallow, uninformative and mostly toothless, ""Journeys with George"" documents the jovial atmosphere on the road with W's 2000 campaign. We are tempted to share the laughs as George & Crew stumble towards their ultimate victory, but by the end of the film, one realizes that the film's central point -- that Bush is likeable -- is something we already knew.Further thumbs-down to camerawoman Pelosi for her constant, excruciatingly extreme close-ups.If you're looking for a political documentary with any real depth or entertainment value, look elsewhere."
4,Nice Puzzle,"For its price, it is a pretty nice puzzle. The pieces fit ok, but the pieces themselves feel a little on the cheaper side. I glued the back together and it is fine. The picture is however, not printed with very high detail. That is probably my only complaint."
4,My art is better than your art,"Kathleen Hanna and co. stack the dack this outing a little more towards pure activism than great songs, and when the mix is particularly bad - in songs like ""Much Finer"" or the yawn of an interlude ""Dyke March 2001"" - the album can feel too weighty and self conscious for its own good. But when the activism and music lines up, the result is explosive. I'm talking about ""Shred A,"" ""Tres Bien"" or ""On Guard"" where the band makes their vivid goal of agit-pop-punk a powerful, undismissable project."
5,A review of the Theology of the Body,I have read a few books on the Theology of the Body by John Paul II. This book put it into a practical question and answer format that can help both a life long Catholic or someone going to RCIA.
5,Simply the best!,"This book is simply the best such book I have seen. It is written in question-and-answer format, easy to read and understand. I had hoped the answers would be good - and they were. I was surprised even more to discover that the questions were so well-stated too.Popular opinion is that traditional views on sexuality are outdated, and that only those with their heads in the sand still hold traditional beliefs. But if you genuinly want to understand the reasons why so many people believe in the sacredness of sexuality within marraige, then give this book a shot. No one explains these views with more clarity than Christopher West."
1,Contains Opinions Stated As Fact,"I like the author and I have heard him talk on tv and I have read many of his great articles that make TOB much easier to understand and he seems to have good intentions in promoting TOB. However, the tone of voice in a few sections in this book sounds off-putting and the author says a few things (such as different positions, etc, etc) that makes it sound that his views are in fact the only that are allowed, but in reality these views are just his personal OPINIONS. If the author would have said things such as, in my opinion I only like one position, etc, then that would have been acceptable. Many people (especially in the church) are very confused about this topic and this is not mentally healthy for people, and in my opinion as a reviewer, books such as this are causing more people (especially women) to go in the wrong direction and to become even MORE repressed/suppressed and that is not good news. Also, to another reviewer: NFP is good."
2,Flawed Book,"Flawed book, flawed presentation by Christopher West, some opinions not distinguished from fact and in violation of natural law. Although some bishops and respected theologians have come out in defense of West and his writings, a cautious stance should be taken. Conversely, others have criticized his approach, most prominently by Alice Von Hildebrand[...]This is a more recommended book:Catholic Sexual Ethics: A Summary, Explanation, & Defense"
2,Am I doing it wrong?,"Like ""Amazon Shopper"" I too read many good reviews on this electric razor--both on amazon.com and several magazines. For the life of me I cannot seem to get a close shave, going back and forth over areas to no avail. The accompanying literature seems to say that the closest shave might not be obtained until after 30 days of use. Let me tell you, it has been 21 days and still terrible. In the meantime, you are not supposed to use a regular razor (presumably while your skin adjusts) so basically you're walking around as a stubbly gal, even though you are shaving every day! At least it hasn't cut me yet. I am very disappointed in this product."
4,Easy to use,1. It is pretty convenient for daily use.2. The charging system is good.Weak point:The side trimmer may hurt skin if it is used in a improper shaving angle.
1,Norelco stealing money with this one,"Don't buy this product! I got this for my wife for her birthday and I agree with the earlier reviewer that asked if it even has a blade in it. My wife asked me to check it out so I tried it on her leg and no matter how many times i ran it over an area, it felt exactly the same. The clippers on the side are the only thing that appear to snip hairs. what a waste of money. I should have just gotten her a mens razor. she suggests that the lady razors they make just never are as good as a mens razor for whatever reason.I even tried it on my 5 o'clock shadow and there was no impact on it whatsoever! No whiskers were cut!To be fair to Norelco, i use a mens norelco on my face every day and have had it for about 5 years and have only recently considered replacing it.But my wife hates the Moi that I bought her. Look someplace else."
2,Not worth the money,I bought this razor in January. It worked GREAT the first few times that I used it. Then it stopped working(cutting). It runs fine it just is not cutting the hairs anymore. It is also difficult to get the cutting block out to clean. It does not have a button. YOu have to squeeze the trimming blades to get the cutting block out. It is not user friendly. I am going back to Remmington.
4,not as close as a blade,"This is pretty good for an electric, especially as it's wet/dry. However, it is not nearly as close a shave as a blade. If you like electrics, this is a good machine. If you are looking to duplicate the shave you get from a blade, this will leave you wanting a closer shave."
1,poor product,"This razor was a gift, but it didn't work very well at all. Had to replace it with something better."
2,it only works on long hairs,"I bought this razor at a filene's near my home and without having read any of these reviews online. I still keep it as a back-up for when I lose my regular razor. It does work but it's not ideal for everyday maintnance. It will not easily trim morning stubble but it will work on hairs long enough to wax. You can use it for shorter stubble but it'll take you a few passes. It'll trim hairs short enough to feel but not see.For me, as an emergency-only option, it's been worth the cost."
1,"DON""T BUY IT!","You might be thinking... well there are some good and some bad reviews about this item. ANd like I did, you might be thinking, well how bad can it be? I'm sure it's not as bad as they say. Think again! Those people were telling the truth. This razor gave me the WORST shave of my life! No kidding! And it's loud, and doesn't charge properly, or even fit in its charger properly so while you think it's charging it's actually not and have to constantly press it back in. I feel robbed of my $15! just spend that money on something else. trust me, you'd be a lot happier! uggh.. i don't know how to convince you anymore, except: Seriously people!! DON""T BUY IT!"
1,Very disappointed,"I have tried and tried to get my razor to charge and it will not do so. Since I did away with the packaging I did not think it could be returned so I am indebted for $28.00 for a product that does not work. As you can imagine, I am not very happy with this purchase."
1,Ms.,I am not happy with the product at all or with your company as I had to send it back and received a different oneand I do not like it at all.
1,Not Worth It,"I have very sensitive skin and shaving with a razor is painful, so I can only do it once a week. I saw a commercial for this razor and was leary, but I did some research and read some good reviews. I purchased the razor hoping that it would allow me to ditch the painful razor. Oh, I was so wrong! Please, don't buy this razor. It does not give a close shave at all! You have to go over spots over and over and still nothing happens. So, by the time you get done, your legs will still be hairy and they will be all red. It leaves stubble 1/8 of an inch long which totally looks like you haven't shaved. You can't wear shorts, swimsuits, nothing. Plus, the battery dies all time when I am in the middle of shaving, even though I charge it properly. If you are looking for a decent shave, this product will not help you."
3,Not the best but very convenient,"You will not get a very good shave with this. No matter how hard you press or how many times you go over your legs it will never be any closer than half a day's growth after a real shave. You trade a close shave for a decent shave with no fuss whatsoever. I like how I don't have to put on flip flops, take a long walk down the hall, and wait ten minutes for the shower to get lukewarm in order to clean up my legs. I just use it in the morning and my legs are usually acceptable.It's not the best but I'm happy with it considering it's an electric razor."
1,"Too small to be a doorstop, Too light to be a paperweight","Mine didn't cut worth anything, and then it broke when dropped. Now, Norelco is renaming it and targeting it at men. This is a cheap cheap razor, you get what you pay for, and there is a reason that this costs less than a ten pack of replacement blades for your real razor. It does, however, hold a charge a long time. But, since it cuts as well as rubbing sandpaper on your skin, it must be noted that sandpaper needs no battery."
4,proved to work well,"I bought this shaver about a year ago, used it a couple times with mediochre results and tossed it in a box with a bunch of other products that didn't prove to work great.Last week tight on cash and with a dulling razor blade I pulled out the shaver dug the charging base out of my trunk and charged it up. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The shave was almost as smooth as a blade and much safer for a quick dry shave showing no irritation. The next time I used it with a shaving gel in the shower and it worked perfect. With no irritation I was able to put lotion on my sensitive skin and my legs are silky smooth. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a convenient electric shaver."
2,sometimes there is a reason for negative reviews,I read the negative reviews and ignored them. I chose to be optimistic and believe that this product would be ok.I was wrong. Don't buy it.
1,Worst Shaver Ever!,Are you wondering why this shaver is now hard to find? It's because it sucks and doesn't work! Do believe the negative reviews on here! Unfortunately I bought it went it first came out at it's highest price! I thought it's Norelco it's got to be good! Wrong! The shaving guard thing in the middle got all warped from trying to take it off for cleaning and the blades on the top and bottom end serve NO purpose! It was like the shaver didn't shave any hair at all;not even close to a smooth shave! I was very dissapointed in Norelco and tossed this shaver into the trash can. I can't believe the testers at Norelco let this product go on the market! :(
4,Norelco Moi Shaver,"This electric shaver is as good as any others that I have used. I have been using it for about 1 week and find that it works better for me with a shaving cream or soap. My legs feel just as smooth after shaving with this product as with the razor blade and the best part is I don't cut my legs!I think the expectations from disappointed users are that it cuts as fast as a razor blade. You do need to go slower and sometimes go over the area twice. You will not find an electric shaver that cuts like a blade. The plus features over other electrics are compact size,shaped like razor blade razors, wet/dry feature, and small charger.Hopefully it gets even better after 21 days as has been the experience of other users.Will keep using."
1,Doesn't Work,"Don't waste your money on this one. Despite trying to shave with it at every possible angle and using various levels of pressure, it just doesn't work well. Its performance is spotty (literally) at best."
2,No close shave with Norelco HP6350,"Although the electric shaver is compact, has a long battery life and can be used in the shower, It does NOT give you a close & smooth shave.You have to shave very slowly to get any of the hair off and then it leaves long stubs. You are better off buying disposable razor's that leave the skin very smooth."
2,Shaver tricked me,"I read reviews on this site and thought I would take a chance. I thought it was the cutest thing ever. To my dismay, it didn't look as good as it did in the pictures. I charged it for the required 16 hours and then took it into the shower for the first time. The noise was a loud buzz that I just hated. The razor is very tricky. The middle aluminum makes it difficult to have both razor edges touch the skin. Anyhow, I tried it. On my legs (which had hair) it completely missed the hairs. I stroked it again and again and yet it still missed the hairs. Dissapointed, I attempted to shave my armpits. It didn't work there either. It left me with hair and a painful cut, which never happened with my Intuition. After this experience, I am returning the razor with its 60-day money back guarantee. In conclusion, I would recomenned not buying this but if you are just SO currious, buy it like I did and try it out. Good luck with that."
1,Norelco HP 6350 Electric Shaver,After paying about $10 shipping for this Shaver it was defective from day one and would not take a charge.I had to pay shipping charges to return this item.
4,Great Product!,"I don't think any electric razor can give you the smoothness of a BIC, but this one is great. It works well, it's easy to clean, the battery lasts a long time... It's great!"
2,Only two-dimensional,"This is a pretty pendant, but it is flat, not three dimensional. You can't really see that from the product description. I sent it back."
1,NOT GOOD,There is not enough if any insulation between hot and cold water reserve. The hot water makes the cold constantly run and if cold is shut off both reserves are hot.It is now nothing but a plain water dispenser!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Very Disappointed,"I consider myself okay handy with lots of experience in putting furnitures together. This item does require quite a bit efforts in putting pieces together, and very difficult at some points. For a simple water dispenser, spending that amount of time installing it does make me unhappy. Besides the parts look very rough, and the door can't be closed 100% (it looks very obvious from side). I really wanted to return this item. But thinking that I have to go through all troubles taking them apart and take this bulky item to post office, I decided to keep it and try to learn not to be a ""perfectionist."" I will not recommend this product to anybody else."
1,Terrible customer service,"The water dispensers cold water does not work. I have been trying to contact Haiers customer service for a month. When you call they take your info and say we will call you back, still waiting. I have tried emailing them numerous times with no response. The unit is also very loud. I would never by from this company again."
1,"Price is cheap, product is cheap.",I'm not too picky on overall presentation but the plastic smell in the water from this dispenser is unbearable. I have been flushing waters down this dispenser to kill the smell with no luck for 4days now. Should'a listen to the other reviwers.
2,Problems whit hot watter.,"They have trouble making hot water comes out almost to a boil, too hot.He that burns a person out when the water dispenser, this causes inconvenience, I hope I can fix the problem."
2,The plastic tap breaks easily,"This water tower is otherwise good but the red tap for hot water broke before I knew it, and there is no way I could fix it myself. Tried four times to call the manufacturer, who never answered the calls. Always busy tone. Thanks to amazon.com for kindly replacing the item. Five stars for amazon.com, and two for this brittle toy.- Why can't they make the taps from metal or something more sturdy?"
4,good value,great price and value....the base was a little tricky to assemble....and there was a rubber taste to the water in the begining....washed it good and let lots of water run through system....it was fine after that...we like the way it performs...
1,Only 6 months before it died.,"I am having a miserable time finding any reliable water dispensers in this world. This is my third brand of water dispenser, and this one lasted 6 months before it started smelling like burned plastic. The cooler doesn't cool, and the smell coming off the unit is burn. Does anyone have a recommendation for a water dispenser that doesn't suck?"
4,Water Cooler,"It seems a little top heavy compared to the old one we had 7 years ago and it's a little noisier when running...but overall, it works well."
3,so so water cooler,"The good thing is the excellent water flow, the negative is is makes a high squeeling sound and the water does not get very cold. The hot water is fairly hot. The cabinet below is a handy compartment.Had to send one back because of noise."
2,Would not recommend,Took me a bit to assemble. Bottom storage compartment is very flimsy. Door seldom stays shut. Followed directions about making sure it was upright for at leaset 10 hours (I let it stand for over the weekend) and made sure water flowed from both hot and cold before plugging it in then switching the red and blue swithces. The first weekend it leaked. I make sure I turn it off every Firday now. I would not recommend this.
4,Good water cooler,"The base is a little wobbly. Its thin plastic, but all in all, it is a good product for the price. The ""Instruction"" manual was no help at all."
2,It doesn't fit the camera completely,"The case does not fit completely the Exilim camera inside, it's not possible to close the case. Anyways, since I keep it in the pocket most of the time, that's not a total useless case, but I was expecting something better."
5,A cultural history and almanac of the bear,"Grizzly Almanac (143-4... provides a cultural history and almanac of the bear, covering everything from hunting regulations and changing environments to bear encounters with humans. An excellent guide to the grizzly."
2,nothing special,"The watch comes in a plain cheap carton box, nothing to give someone as a gift already....the box doesnt look appealing at all.The temperature reading is totally off. It has been off since I got it 2 weeks ago and now I have to figure out how to calibrate it. When it freezes outside it says it is 71 degrees F. Nice !!! I better check the compass and altitude meter !!!!!!The watch looks ok, but I find the material used all TOO plastic....Also the watch goes up to the year 2039 only .... so they know by then it will definitely be broken :-)So in my opinion, this watch is nothing special !!!"
4,Great watch-Casio service leaves a lot to be desired,"I loved this watch when I got it and enjoyed it for years. I dig gadgets and it had enough to keep me busy for quite some time. Unfortunately, once the batteries died (there are several of them in the watch), nothing ever worked right again. Casio service was an absolute joke. They quoted me one price but charged my credit card significantly more. Then they charged me yet another fee. I had been charged close to $200 to fix a $100 watch. It took phone calls and letters to Casio headquarters to get things straightened out-and then the SOBs at the repair place wouldn't send my watch back.I want to get another Pathfinder quite badly but I just don't know if I am willing to risk dealing with Casio again. I don't like getting rear ended like that.4 stars for the watch.-5 stars for Casio service"
5,Husband Loved It,"I bought this for my husband for Father's Day and he absolutely loves it! It was very quick to setup, looks great and is very feature rich. Granted the thermometer is not the best feature since you do have to take it off and wait for 20 minutes or so, but the compass is so cool! He's big into hiking so the altimeter is fantastic. My guy won't wear anything but Casio and this is now is day-to-day Go-To watch. For the price, you can't beat it!"
4,Great watch,"I really like this watch. I have always owned a casio sport watch, this is the best one I have owned. I like the all the features that the Pathfinder, expecially the compas. Its a great watch overall"
3,Neat but Bulky,"I bought this strictly for hiking.Lots of neat features. Altimeter works, but admittedly I haven't calibrated it yet.The problem is it is simply too big. On a hot hiking day you would rather not have a saucer of a watch on your arm. It isn't too heavy, just physically too large for my liking. Problem with sleeves, etc.Also, the band is a bendable, but hard plastic that is not very comfortable. would like it to have been a been more pliable. not rubber, because rubber pulls arm hair."
4,Works great.. need a manual to keep track of functions,I bought this watch for a recent Ranier trip. Most of the functions work great. The altimeter was very helpful in a whiteout we were stuck in. The compass worked well although we had a backup GPS just in case. While most of the functions are easy to navigate some of the less used functions are not quite as intuitive. The temperature reading is OK if the watch is off your wrist but it would be nice if someone would invent a watch that did not need to be removed to measure the temp.
5,Gift from my wife !,The watch that my wife bought from amazon was a excellent pickthe old watch was a casio made in 1994 older version of the pathfinderbut the new one is even better than that one very easey to program and setand is very accurate love the way it works thankyou Chris!
2,Think,The construction of the watch is not what others have said even with their war stories and adventures. I have been in some places that most would never want to be and survival is based on your intellect and who you know. The watch functions pretty well while in the box but has trouble standing up to ruff conditions (which the company claims it can). I was given the watch to use and within a few weeks the the pin (which holds the band to the watch) was ripped from the watch and in turn damage the watch so as not to be useable. This is not my definition of a tough watch. If I was to draw any conclusion from this I would say this watch is great as long as you don't wear it while doing any physical labor. It doesn't have to be high tech to perform well. My advice is - Dive watches do what they were designed to do and they are made for ruff conditions. Just think it through - what ever the watch is made out of would be a great indicator of what you can expect from that watch.
4,Excellent watch but sensors are not that accurate,Pros:1. The watch looks classy on hand but remember if you have thin wrist this watch will look like grandfathers clock on your hand(its huge).2. Easy to calibrate. I had no difficulty understanding the manual.3. Night visibility is excellent.4. True waterproof. I went into Niagara falls wearing this watchCons:sensors are not at all accurate. Temperature is never accurate even when watch is not in hand. Altimeter is absolutely crazy and barometer shows some stupid graphs and no relevant information. The compass is good thoughconclusion: Nice watch but dont purchase it for sensors and also its not for small hands.
3,Nice watch but BEWARE -- quality defect causes watch band screws to fall out,"I like the watch but....BE SURE TO TIGHTEN THE WATCH BAND SCREWS ON YOUR WATCH BEFORE WEARING IT OR ELSE THEY CAN FALL OUT.The watchband screws fell out after I wore the watch about a dozen times. I don't wear it every day. I searched the web and found other people had the same problem.I sent a couple of emails to Casio customer service and they never responded. If you lose a screw, you will have to either ship your watch to Casio, at your expense, with a copy of your receipt (if you still have it)and hope it is covered under warranty.Or you can buy it online through Casio. I ended up buying the screw online for fifteen including shipping."
2,Casio pathfinder,This watch is good for barometric pressure and compassForget temperature and altimeter unless you hang from your pack
2,Casio Men's Green Pathfinder Triple Sensor Watch #PAG40-3V,"Not a great watch.1. The buttons are too easy, which results in accidental ""switching"" between different modes2. The thermometer is not very useful because in order to get a reading you must remove the watch from the hand for at least 30 minutes (otherwise it shows the temperature of your hand)3. There is significant error on altitude measurement with pressure sensor (I checked multiple times using reliable references)"
4,"Good Value, Lots of Functions","I first saw this watch at a box store for over $200. I liked the functions and large number size as I have gotten a tad older now. My last watch with an altimeter, barometer and compass was a tad hard to operate. Not this one. Easy to figure out even without the directions though the ones provided are ample. Plus I was able download a copy of for easy reference. The price at Amazon was great too. So far."
3,low profile for sure,this is defiantly a low profile pci bracket for the nvs280 but its meant for current systems and don't fit older low profile setups.I had to use an longer screw to keep in in place as it don't sit up on the resting lip in my machine.
1,Rehash,"This book, which was previously published as ""Chevelle & SS Muscle Portfolio 1964-1972,"" is an anthology of ancient (mostly from the `60's) magazine articles which are of dubious value to the Chevelle enthusiast and of no value whatsoever to the restorer. This new edition does add three articles dating from the mid `90's, if that's what you're interested in. It would be nice if we were told something about the book (I hold Amazon responsible for that failure); a description would have been nice. As you may be able to tell; I'm kicking myself for making the purchase."
4,Interesting,Vygotsky's views on psycological development are very interesting and although his language can be a little dry it's very engaging.
3,FX 890,"We use the FX-890 to print all of our orders for our business and had the first one for over seven years without any problems. Once it got so old, we decided to just buy a new one. Since the day we replaced the old one, the new one never worked quite right and keeps smudging the second line. We called Epson over three times and have been on the phone with them for almost an hour every time but the problem always comes back. It seems this printer is a hit or miss...or maybe we just got a bad egg."
4,got it!,i am using this perfume from 10 years.its a bit strong smell but i am so used to it i cannot resist without spraying this when i go out.its cheap but good and i enjoy it and so do my friends.timely delivery and thx amazon.
1,This is a joke.,"Just bought my Kindle the last week of February and started the two week free subscription to try this blog out. During the two weeks, not a single blog. I don't mind if it is inconsistant but I think it is a joke to charge .99 cents a month for this. The last blog achived on the site is from February 23rd."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Wouldn't work when I first got it; finally did, sporadically. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't. Partially frozen fruit bound it up and had to wait 20 minutes before it would run again. The warranty doesn't offer a refund, just repairs or replacement. No thank you, mine went in the garbage!"
3,Inferior to original model,"I bought the original model, JIN 999 and it was the most useful kitchen device that I ever owned. Eventually, the plastic of the cross-blade cracked and for some reason the company did not carry replacements. As a consequence, I bought this Model JMS 999. It is not nearly as good because the plastic seal becomes loose and is either chewed up or at least causes leakage.I wish that they would bring back their original model."
4,Enlightening on a Dark Area of Physics,"I am one of those people who can't get enough of something. I can't get enough knowledge about physics. So when I saw this book, I thought ""Bingo!"" I checked it out, and whoa! Forget Encarta or Groliers; this actually explains relativity, and clearly! I now can almost understand this theory. Read this book, physics maniacs!"
3,Watch dosage & price,"Be very careful when comparing with other brands. It takes 4 of these a day to get the 1200 mg most doctors recommend. Other brands necessitate taking only 2 a day. You may not be saving as much money as you think. More importantly, you may not be taking enough."
1,Does not work!,"This eyelash curler does not work. Don't buy it. I just returned mine. I followed the instructions, left it on until it got hot, used it on my eyelashes, but no curl. Also, the heat irritates your eye, so be careful!"
4,"Ribs, Ribs, and more Ribs","I become skeptical when I see a word such as ""Great"" in the title of a book. It is either immodesty or exaggeration. I am happy to report that, in this case, the word fits very well.Each recipe is complete unto itself. It includes the rib type, rib preparation, recommended cooking technique, a rub, the mop, sauces, serving suggestion, etc. The recipes are simple and easy to follow. Kudos to the the kitchen testing staff. Of note is that most recipes can be done simply in an oven, and do not not require a smoker.This is a good example of a cookbook that focuses on only one subject. It does a very good and very thorough job covering its subject.My complaint here is that the book will not lay open flat in the kitchen when you are doing the recipes.The recipes are reliable, and you will love the flavors. Highly recommended."
4,Great little charger,"The beauty of this charger is that it can rejuvenate a sulfided battery. If you let your battery run down completely, sulfite forms on the plates from the sulfuric acid that is in the battery. The sulfite insulates the plates and the battery no longer works. This charger has the feature that pulses the battery and breaks up the sulfite.This charger is very safe, fast and powerful, especially for it's size.The reason for only four stars is that if your battery is completely dead (if you left the lights on all day and night), this charger refuses to charge the battery and gives the code that the battery is no good. This is probably a safety issue, since it does not detect any voltage and therefore can't tell if you have the battery hooked up backwards. If you can get a little charge into the battery (jump it or use a different charger), then this charger recognizes the battery and will charge it the rest of the way."
2,Very aggravating,"I have had the charger for about three years, and I hate it. It works great if your battery is just low and needs recharged, and the 100 amp start feature works very well. If the battery is nearly or completely discharged, though, forget it. You will get an error code (which you have to look up) telling you the battery is no good, and the charger shuts itself off. Or you will get a message that the battery is fully charged, and the charger will shut itself off. You can hook up another charger to partially charge the battery, and this charger will recognize that the battery is good after all and will finish charging it. If you have to have another charger to start the charge, then why do you need this one to finish it? Smart charge? Not in my opinion! I have not had any problem with the clamps breaking. They are pretty much a real pain when trying to hook to a side terminal battery, but they are pretty sturdy."
2,good for mechanics.. not for builders,"I wanted to see how in depth it would be to build my own turbine.. this was a true disapointment. The author makes many assumptions and leaves out a lot of useful information. if oyu want to build a turbine from parts oyu can purchase this is a good reference, particularly if you live in Europe.... I wish i had passed on it."
3,"Really basic, but a good starting point for a beginner...","I'm currently a studying to become a licensed massage therapist and am extremely disappointed that 'sports massage' isn't one of the classes offered in my studies. Trying to gather as much information as possible on my own - I purchased this video at a local massage supply store. The explanation, demonstration, and timing for each massage is useful - but the techniques are extremely basic and most of them are strokes I already knew. This video just reassured I was on the right track. I do like the demonstrations on injury management and different techniques to use for different situations... but overall, I guess I expected or was looking for a little more. My quest for pre/post event massage information continues."
1,Silent Alarm Clock,"This alarm clock will never startle you. The alarm does not function. Made in China. I have a wind up Big Ben 70 years old,made in U.S.A. It works as well as it did when it was new.I gave the Moonbeam one star only because zero was not an option."
3,rude awakening,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers; although a very nice looking clock, its intended effect of waking one up peacefully isn't the case. It's actually very startling to be woken up by a flashing light. Also, it is quite bright and noisy even when the alarm isn't activated. *sigh* So much for my attempt to be ""old-school""."
5,Big Ben's Moonbeam Clock is over the moon,"Great clock. Love the retro look; it's perfect with our 70+ year- old house and 100+ year-old furniture. We have one in each bedroom now, thanks to Amazon as we couldn't find it in any brick-and-morter retailer. The flashing is great if you're not too asleep. If you are, the tone will get you for sure."
1,Alarm never worked,I've tested the alarm clock BEFORE going to sleep numerous times to make sure that I was not just sleeping through the alarm and sure enough...it never worked once for me. I tried various settings thinking I might of picked the wrong settings but nothing works. I would not recommend this for anyone.
1,Snooze on through the moonbeams,"Well how novel is this? The teen wouldn't wake up to music, or buzzers, so how about flashing lights? Neither the blinks nor the bells disturb the sleeping boy. Don't buy it, the concept or the clock. Try pouring water on him; that works and it's cheaper!"
1,Two Broken Clocks In a Row,"I have been the owner of a Moonbeam Clock for the past 5 years and it worked and continues to work beautifully, so recently I decided to buy another one. When I received the new clock I discovered that the alarm bell was broken (I discovered this by oversleeping). So I thought, ""no big deal, I'll get another one, it must have been broken during shipping."" I exchanged the broken clock and received a brand new one, only to discover that the flashing light on this one was broken. So I packed it up and have decided to get something different. I love my old one, don't know what's happened to the quality of them."
1,cute but useless,"After searching for literally weeks to find an attractive alarm clock with an illuminated analog face, I found this one. Despite the negative reviews, I decided to go for it.The clock IS cute, and the alarm isn't too loud or offensive. I love the way it lights up before the alarm rings.Here's the bad part: IT DOESN'T KEEP TIME. Literally each evening I'd need to reset it. And then I'd worry it would fall behind again before morning.My advice: don't waste the shipping charges. However, if you're desparate, I wish you luck. Maybe you'll get one that works."
2,Lovely Migraine Starter,"This is a nice looking clock on the outside, but very ugly inside. According to the owners manual, the flashing light gently begins the waking process. Very, very wrong. My long gone migraine headaches came back when I started using this clock. The flashing light was so intense, that I had to take the bulb out. I hear the clock click loudly and that wakes me up before the killer audible alarm. The audible alarm is the most annoying alarm I have ever heard!My wife loves the look of this clock, and I have a new hobby, finding ways to make both alarms less annoying. One time, I dreamt that I was lashed to a neon sign and couldn't make the flashing stop. I had a headache all day. So, where to from here? I am looking for a less intense bulb for the unit.The things we do for love......."
1,"Great concept, horrible quality","I was very excited about this clock and was really looking forward to waking up peacefully with a light. While the seller was incredibly helpful (The Westclox Source) and prompt and all-around excellent, the clocks suck. I received two broken ones-the hour hand on the alarm wouldn't move, in order to set it. An alarm-less alarm clock is no good. Sure wish these clocks weren't of terrible quality."
2,sloppy workmanship,"Unfortunately,I was attracted by the retro design,like many others, until I plugged it in-between the 2 O'Clock and 4 O'Clock positions, there is a jagged,grey ""edge"" that distracts from the rest of the clock face-and a bright pinpoint light that pierces thru at 3 O'Clock. A defct for sure, but I have tried 2 and both have the same problem, so I think it is a mfr's defect(China) It is very annoying;instead of a consistent mellow clockface,you see the obvious greyish,jagged area so the entire face is not visually a perfect circle.Like someone took scissors and mistakenly cut it wrong. Cheap imitation of the real mcCoy back in the 50's."
3,"Good Clock, A Little Too Bright","I first saw this clock in the movie "" In Good Company"". It was so cool that I had to have it. The flashing functionit makes is pretty awesome but it does go off sometimes that it is not supposed to. Also I found the illuminated dial a bit too bright for my taste but I am getting used to it. Overall this clock is pretty cool but it definantly could be made better."
2,not totally pleased,"this clock could have been so cool but fell short. first, it's huge - i had to move everything off of my night table just to accomodate its bulk. second, it's bright. third, i never did notice the ""awaken by light"" feature but the alarm was enough to wake the dead! perfect for someone who goes into a catatonic sleep and has real trouble waking. i returned it :(("
1,WESTCLOX USE TO BE A GOOD NAME,"Worked for two years and stopped keeping time and stopped sending alarm. What a huge rip-off! As other reviewers stated, made in China quality stinks. There is no excuse for this clock to consistently have so many failures. You can't reach anyone at Salton; they're only recourse is send you to a repair shop which involved much time and a sealed part that could not be repaired without replacement. Shame on you Salton! Gave it one star, as another reviewer said, because system does not permit me to give it a zero!"
3,Great product idea but not well built,"I have had one for about a year. It works great when it works, but I have had problems with it going off at miscellaneous times of the day and night so I have had to send it to the dumpster. However, the light really works at waking you up without jarring you awake. Problem is, mine wakes me up at other times of the night as well."
2,Terrifying,"If you're such a heavy sleeper that you need to be scared awake, this is the clock for you. Otherwise, I don't recommend this clock. I got it because it's supposed to be 'considerate', with a 'friendly' alarm. Wrong. If you set it to wake you up in the early morning hours when it's still dark, you'll wake up in a panic when the bright light starts flashing in your face. If you're getting up a little later when the room is too bright for you to notice the flashing light, you'll be instantly awakened, heart pounding, by the obnoxious sound of the alarm. It's definitely *not* friendly -- it is the same sound made by the old-style alarm clocks with the two bells on top, not a pleasant way to wake up. Furthermore, the clock face lights up so bright that the room never gets fully dark at night, which is not conducive to a good night's sleep. About all I can say for this clock is that the retro design looks cool."
5,Forever Begins Tonight,"In a word ""FANTASTIC"" he is a great entertainer and it's unfortunate we don't see more of him here in the United States."
5,I SO love this guy and it's all because of...........,"........Track 6 (Bella Bella Signorina).Why that track, you ask? Well, that's the one which shows ""P"" is so sure, so comfortable with who he is that he's not concerned to go falsetto to give this number just the touch it needs. Hey, how many current day male singers do you know who'd do that? Maybe not any. What a guy!And it's not just in his musically recorded performances, available on disc and otherwise, it's also in his live and video-recorded gigs that he puts so much energy.......so much of himself into it. It's difficult to think of someone else who reaches such levels of passion in musical productions. This man could issue a new recorded collection monthly, and I'd buy every one. No question.****"
5,Great Italian Singer,"I bought both CD's and love them. I am of Italian descent and really enjoy singing in Italian and English. Patrizio has a great voice, not to mention his good looks. One of my favorite songs is ""Angels""."
1,converter,"We haven't installed our converter yet. The instructions cause severe migraines and attempting to assemble this product will cause cussing and foul language. My husband, an industrial mechanic, gave up and the parts have laid in the floor since before Christmas."
4,"so far, so sturdy","""The Converter"" has been a welcome addition to our backyard garage (we have a slanted roof). The system was pretty easy to setup, but it was quite heavy. I would recommend THREE strong adults for the final attaching of the backboard to the system. The fact that we can move the backboard up and down is great for parents while the lower settings are just right for introducing basketball to our four and six year olds."
1,missing parts,"Most of the parts were missing from the box. I had to call the manufacturer to get the parts shipped, and they did ship the missing parts, but it was a big headache."
3,Nice Product but be careful with installation,"We installed this on my garage roof, and overall I think it is a very good product but I have 2 concerns.1. Installation takes two adults. I am a fairly young man who is not Hulk Hogan but a fairly average strength and my neighbor helped me with this and he is bigger than me and we nearly killed ourselves trying to get this installed on the garage. The last step is very difficult and ideally would have used 4 adult males.2. After getting the product installed we realized that due to the height of the garage roof and ability to secure it properly, the lowest it could go was 9 feet 6 inches. Now that is fine for me but the point in purchasing this was for practice for my children who play on 8 and 9 foot goals. Very disappointing!Still, I use the goal regularly and it is a strong, well built product and I have enjoyed it. I will also say that once it is installed it is quite easy to adjust the height, although I have no need to go very much higher with it."
5,Echoing brilliance.,"Pendulum finds itself parading through a variety of musical styles on the smokey free jazz style of ""one hour empire"" and a more daring leap into scattered tones of ""violent playground"" and ""minus two"" yet still holding onto what is rightfully theirs.From the upbeat,yet distant tone of ""small song 4"" and ""Pendulum"", to the vaporous slink of ""still feels like tears"" Trish Kennans octave haunts you with such beauty....melodic,on key and as she purs and whispers while Stevens,Felton and Cargill add that trademark sound of 60's melody and timing to the modern day pops,clicks and elecro fuzz that makes this collective so unique.A gem to have,watching as they progress is sheer beauty...tune into the Broadcast....a clear and inviting signal for all to hear."
2,"throw it down broadcast, one time...please!!!","Broadcast has added a ham-fisted macho drummer, who proceeds toobliterate any of the mysterious subtleties this once great bandpossessed. What were they thinking? Were they thinking??? Themusic on this disc is as ugly as the cover art. Makes meappreciate St. Etienne even more."
1,Definately Not what you expect,"I was very disappointed to think I spent almost 30 dollars on a piece of wallpaper basically. When i read peelable, i was thinking it was like holiday decorations, self sticking on the wall but removable. No, this is wallpaper, you wet it and hang it. The picture is cute, but the quality and price are definately not worth it. I am very disappointed in this product. You can do other things with it which is what I will do, find some plexiglass or something, attach it to that, and put a hook on the back, so at least we can take it with us when we move, but this is the worst growth chart I have purchased. Guess that is what i get for buying online and not being able to see the product first hand to know what i am really buying. Buyers beware!! Don't waste your money."
4,"The playing is excellent, but with sound issues","The Beethoven Quintet and the Gypsy Trio are excellent, both in artistry and in sound. The two Haydn quartets, however, are marred by sudden bursts of crackling static. This is quite unfortunate, because without the sound imperfections, this would easily be a 5 star performance. As it stands, this is still a highly enjoyable disc, and all of the performances are top-notch."
1,it is not like the picture,"i surpise after i recieved the itme because i wasn't same as the picture. the colore different, more light."
1,Wolf Blitzer Proxy Biography,"The story Blitzer tells of Jonathan Jay Pollard is actually also Blitzer's own story. The sympathy he shows for Pollard is a American zionist's sympathy for other zionists who put the safety and well-being of the United States completely under the feet of Israel.Israel gives nothing, America gives billions in assistance and blood. Israel needs to learn to stand on their own. America does no good to Israel by propping up extreme zionists leaders and their laquis like AIPAC trained blitzer."
5,Do you like Stephen King?,"Then you'll like James Van Pelt's ""Strangers and Beggars."" The stories here cover fantasy and science fiction with an emphasis on fantasy in the modern world. They are at once thought provoking and entertaining. Van Pelt is a name to watch for."
2,I thought most of the stories were a bit bizarre . . .,"I really enjoyed Mr. Van Pelt's Summer of the Apocalypse but this book was a bit bizarre and the stories didn't make any sense, none of them. I was quite looking forward to this book and I was really disappointed in the stories and the characters.A giant spider in the classroom that the administration does nothing about? Weird little dwarves, kids with ""special talents"" was over the top for me. There is a mixture of sci-fi, horror and fantasy in the stories and none of them seemed to hit it off with me and I am a huge fan of sci-fir and horror and of Mr. Van Pelt's.Perhaps I will just stick to Mr. Van Pelt's novels as his short stories left me scratching my head."
1,NO ERA LO QUE ESPERABA,"AL VER EL TITULO DISCO DISCO, ME TRANSPORTE A LA EPOCA DE GLORIA DE LOS 70'S, QUE DESILUCION, ESTE DVD TIENE MUSICA DE LOS INICIOS DEL TECNO DE LOS 80'S, ES MUSICA DE DISCOTECA, NO RECUERDO NINGUNA DE ELLAS............REALMENTE ME DESILUCIONE AL VER ESTE DVD, NO ES LO QUE BUSCABA Y DESEABA.............."
3,Chris Clark - Ceramics Is The Bomb,"Full of hiss and strange spine-tingling noises? Why, it's must be Chris Clark and his Ceramics is the Bomb EP. (Who'd you think I was going to say? Aphex Twin? Autechre?) ""The Gavel"" starts in with some booming beats, but ""Slow Spines"" and ""Frost Investigation"" seem to skitter by without notice. ""Shonny"" ends with some of the melodic IDM that we know and love, and that melodic sense carries into ""Rob Lee."" A good, though not particularly memorable, EP."
3,"Good, in some respects","This book is an enjoyable enough read, especially for one who can understand Peter Conrad's intense interest in Hitchcock's films. But make no mistake: Conrad is not a film critic. This is not to denigrate him in the least. On the contrary, he is a knowledgeable, capable writer whose knowledge of literature certainly adds to the book's interest.Still, too much of the book is devoted to describing what is plainly there on the screen.For a much more fascinating critical resource, I highly recommend reading Robin Wood's Hitchcock's Film Revisited. That book, even more than Hitchcock/Truffaut, is the book I will return to the most often for insightful discussion of these great films. Wood was among the very first critics whose work on Hitchcock established his films as a serious and worthy subject of film criticism."
4,Conrad does a great job analyzing Hitchcocks themes,"Peter Conrad has long loved the films of Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Ever since he was a boy who skipped school to peer in wonder at the master filmmakers Psycho he has studied the works of Hitch.Conrad's book is fascinating as he delineates the major themes and preoccupations (and yes-hangups!) of the Cockney genius. The author explores such subjects as Hitch's thoughts on music, food, religion, authority figures, sex and art.I will use this book more than the Truffaut interviews as I view again and again the great films of the Master of Suspense.Well recommended."
1,Not worth your money or time,"Interested in learning more about atypical neuralgia, this short article really did not add any knowledge to what is readily available on the internet. I suffer with what I believe is atypical trigeminal neuralgia."
5,Really get things going...,We read this to each other and it seems to warm things up in the bedroom... We are enjoying things more and it's bringing us closer.
4,"another fine, albiet rather difficult album from rollins.","this album has at least 5 really awesome songs (""disconnect"",""liar"",""step back"",""alien bluprint"" and ""shine"").aside from that,its pretty, dare i say it, boring.as we saw on ""the end of silence"", rollins starts to mellow out and becomes less hostile and more concerned with jamming.nothing wrong with that,in fact i really enjoy that part,but i buy rollins albums because i can relate to the anger and what he talks about.when thats gone,i just cant get into it as much.dont get me wrong,this music is light years ahead of what most other bands are doing,but it just doesent stick to me.so,its not the music that i cant get into, its rollins vocals and lyrics, that for the most part,are not as intense as they used to be.hey, im glad hes not as screwed up as he used to be,but the truth is, thats really what made him GREAT, and so appealing.so, get this, but get ""life time"", ""hard volume"" and ""hot animal machine"" first."
3,"Okay, I guess...","But if you guys want to hear a MUCH BETTER Rollins band album, check out The End of Silence. Thats probably their best album. Also, I could have done without the one song called ""The Wrong Man"". I thought the lyrics were kind of stupid."
4,rollins,"worth a listen . hard rock with well written intellectual lyrics . rollins band has a simpler sound which is ok , weezer , cky , rush all kind of have the simpler sound i am talking about , where as black label society , acdc or slayer having 2 guitarist well they don't sound as simple. if you like hard rock this for you . i would rate rollins band :weight as classic in my book"
4,A solid good piece of beat poetry,"I was first exposed to this when I heard ""Liar"", and it quickly became a hit with me. I figured after 15 years let's check out the rest of this album. I wasn't impressed with ""Disconnect"", but ""Fool"" made up for it big time. There's rap, funk, heavy metal ala Hendrix on here, so no one should be disappointed. ""Tired"" also could've been recorded by Marilyn Manson, so there's no end to the possibilities on this album. I know that Rollins probably didn't care if it hit big, but to me this was his commercial breakthrough. I really don't know what more I can say about this album as it was probably one of the best from the 90's."
5,Worth The Effort!,I enjoyed the album. The purchase was worth the short wait! The price was also better than if I were to buy it at most other places. Cool!
4,"A little pricy for what it is, but works great.","Yes, it does leave a tiny, tiny bit of stubble behind but if it is just peach fuzz then it's no big deal. For darker, more coarse hair it probably would not be satisfactory. I think this is a great little gadget for use on the face. It is a quick and painless way to keep unwanted facial hair at bay."
2,Get a cheaper one at a discount chain store,"Nowadays, you can get a similar product at any Target, Walmart, etc. for a lot less. Plus, the closeness of the shave is not that great, but can be helpful if you need a quick touchup b/c it fits in your purse or desk at work. So, it's a great emergency tool if all other options are not available."
2,So-So Facial Trimmer,"I bought this from QVC. It will do the trick for quick touch-ups - not close hair removal, but close enough. Unfortunately, mine is barley operating anymore, even with a fresh battery. I'm not sure why the motor seems to be dying. Maybe the life of the trimmer is not that long. As a result, I think it would be better to buy a cheaper one since it should work just as well."
3,Good MP3 Player,"Pros:Plays MP3sGood PriceUSB portCons:Everything about the RadioThe radio feels like it's an analog tuner with a digital display of the channel. This would be fine, but the display doesn't quite match the channel playing, and it has a tendency to drift while driving down the road. There are no presets, so if you are tired of the current station, plan on having someone change the channel for you, or pull over, as watching the display to change channels is dangerous while driving.The MP3 capabilities are great, and the ability to skip 10 songs at a time is a nice feature. It also has a search feature, but I haven't tested this.If you mostly play MP3s or CDs, and are looking for a great value, buy this. If you listen to the radio more then casually, then look for another radio."
3,CD player,"Although the CD player did not work I Etronics was quick to give me the information in order to send the CD player back and get my refund. They had great customer service, so they receive 3 stars."
1,garbage,"If I could give 0 I would.In this book one can find only hate, hate and hate towards everything which does not come from India.Of course not any scientific proof for history of India except his own interpretation of Puranas and similar scriptures.Do not waste your time...."
1,Stylistic idiot,"This author advocates steering clear of brown shoes as they are ""not versatile."" Anyone who says this is not qualified to give fashion advice to anyone. Brown is the most versatile color there is, can be wonderfully antiqued, given all sorts of depth and character. If it's classic style you're after rather than trendy Kenneth Cole rubbish, do not listen to this woman."
5,Mints for Grownups,"My wife paid a lot more than the Amazon price for a tin of these mints at a new age type store. I was skeptical about them up until I put one in my mouth. The pear and tea flavors work extremely well together. Of course, green tea is something I enjoy. Those who do not enjoy the somewhat vegetal flavor of sencha may not like these mints.Green tea is not a highly caffeinated beverage. The mild green tea caffeine kick these mints deliver is noticeable but not particularly strong. I like that. Just don't overdo it. One tin of these leaf shaped morsels should last some time."
3,not the best,This book had a lot of things happening in it...ya rite! the ken and maria storyline is old and tarnished. Conner is driving me crazy even if he is sober!Worth da money but still sorta boring.
4,good,"i luv this series sooo much, but i heard that close to you is the last one. i would be so mad. she cant stop writing them. there 2 good"
5,Great all around medium hot sauce!,"This sauce is far from the hottest(it's medium in my book),but does have bite,I always have this handy,as I can find it easily at my local grocery store! One of my favorite hot sauces!"
5,A wonderful historical recounting of a forgotten segment,"This book brings to light some of the other populations that have faced discrimination for centries, the gypsies. Folts has personal knowledge that shines through the horror of Nazi Germany's devastating era. Everyone who is concerned about history repeating itself, should read this book. This is discrimination and scapegoating at its worst. Man's inhumanity to man. The book is well documented and thoughtfully written without sentiment."
1,not nearly enough,"If you need to know what ""act"" and ""scene"" are, or the name of the characters in the play, this might fit the bill. As far as having all those strange Shakespearean words, well, they are not to be found.Not a good purchase for me."
2,Can you really call this a Dictonary of Shakespeare?,"I bought this book to help me understand what Shakespeare says. If you have ever read Shakespeare, or had to perform it, then you understand what I mean. You won't learn what does ""What tributaries follow him to Rome"" mean. (Which by the way means ""What Captive Princes follow him to Rome"".) That simply isn't in this book.This is what I need a Dictionary of Shakespeare to do. All the information about Shakespeare and all references to his work isn't particularly helpful when you don't understand what ""tributaries"" are. I suggest you take a pass at this book."
1,PIECE OF JUNK/DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK,SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.A PEN LIGHT WOULD DO THE SAME THING.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,OR YOU WILL LOOK AS SILLY AS ME.I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUNK"
1,Disappointed with purchase,"I was looking for some good Hawaiian music -- this album is not what I thought it was. It was displayed with all the Hawaiian music, but it doesn't even sound Hawaiian. Once opened however I was unable to return it, so I guess I'm stuck with it."
5,Maika'i Nui Loa!!,"Beautiful~~ Soothing~~What a thrill this CD won the Grammy for the first ever Hawaiian Music category. This CD features slack key guitarists who truly embody the beauty of all things Hawaiian. Their talent individually is incredible-- collectively it is mind boggling. If you've ever personally seen any of them play, you know what I mean. Slip this CD in the player, dim the lights, kick back and relax. Let these guys take over & you'll swear you feel the warm sun, hear the gentle waves rolling in, and see the beauty of the immense diversity of the countryside throughout the Hawaiian islands."
5,Absolutely puts me in an aloha state of mind,This is a great CD. Super talented musicians. And it's very relaxing after a stressful day -- brings me back to our lovely vacations in the beautiful state of Hawaii. aaahhhh...
5,Better than Gravitation!,Gamerz Heaven was the most awesome Manga I ever read! The characters were interesting and as passionate as Gravitation. This series seemed a little more in depth and a little better written. I also loved the intensity of the story and the mysteries within it! I wish ADV would continue to publish this series. Maybe TOKYO POP will take up the publishing of this book if enough people give them a reason to. Tokyo Pop listens to their consumers and will with enough persuading publish the manga you want! :)
3,Time consuming but worth it,The Petite Nail Care system does a great job if you have the time. The power unit is just like the units for hair removal. I don't know how long the abrasive pads will last. They include one spare set but don't mention how to get more abrasive pads. All in all a good but overpriced unit. If you can't get additional abrasive pads then this unit is disposable.
4,Grandson loves Batman The Brave and the Bold Video,My 8 year old Grandson is infatuated with Batman The Brave and the Bold. So I bought this video and he loves it.
3,"Okay, but somewhat sexual","My almost 5 year old son is addicted to any and all Super Heros. He had been requesting this movie after he saw a commercial for it so I bought it. There are some sexual references, many of the females look like porn stars and there is some graphic violence for a young child to see. I wish cartoonists would remember that young children are who they should be marketing to and making these types of movies for. If they want to sex it up, then go into the full on porn industry. I am NOT a prude by any stretch of the immagination but would prefer for my child to not be so sexed-up by the movies he watches when they are supposed to be kid friendly."
4,Super Idea,"The series was working. Letting the ""second string"" heroes of D.C. get some face time was a great way of bringing the old time fans and introducing them to a new generation. The stories are throwbacks to the comics of the 1960's and 1970's. Good stories with entertainment for all and no need to have excessive gore or complex subplots. Good for any fan or just to sit around an watch with your kids."
4,A Bargain.,"Very good speakers for the price; they have good base and are a bargain. You can spend a lot more money and get better speakers, but for my mp3 player I find these are all I need."
4,"Excellent sound, but no AC adapter","For the small footprint of this system, it produce exceptionally good sound, beats most systems like that and a lot of bigger boomboxes as well. Only problem is lack of an AC adapter. Saitek charges 17 bucks (including s/h) to send me an AC adapter."
5,Great sound from a portable speaker,I like the sound and the portable size. They do sound a little tinney in a small room but actually sound better in a large room. I would buy these agan. I like how the design is not your standard square speaker. I run rechargable batteries and plan on buying a AC adapter.
5,Informational Picture Books for Children,"Designed to assist teachers, librarians and parents select children's books that are factual in nature, this book fills a gap by providing a wide bibliographic scope, thoroughly annotated, of the current literature available. Cianciolo chose 250 recently published (1994-1999) picture books for preschool through middle school children for her evaluations. Her guidelines for selection of these books by both aesthetic and literary merit are useful when evaluating other titles in this genre. She includes a variety of subject areas, from biographies, numbers and arithmetic to arts and crafts. An excellent contribution to be included in anyone's library where selection of quality children's materials is paramount."
1,Not quiet at all,Both the product description and one of the reviews claimed this to be a very quiet hairdryer. It isn't.I've heard jackhammers that are quieter than this worthless dryer.
2,Not happy at all with this one,"I wish I had taken the advice of the first review and not purchased this pan. There is no stamp on the bottom of mine so I'm not even sure if it's really made by Calphalon. The surface is extremely grainy in texture compared to my other Calphalon nonstick pots and pans. I wasn't thrilled at all with this pan, and hardly ever use it."
2,Not Calphalon quality,"Don't buy this expecting to get Calphalon, or a $70 pan on really great sale. This pan is worth about $10-$15, so base the sale price on that. The box it comes in says nothing about Calphalon, nor does the product."
1,"Why pay this when the 10"" 'Everyday' pan is being advertised for less??","Another 'peculiarity' of Amazon's pricing (The 10"" pan is advertised for $10 less and has almost universal 5 Star reviews!). My recommendation is to go with Anolon Advanced. Calphalon is quite honestly 'all over the map' when it comes to durability and quality.Be sure to checkout the highly rated (and less expensive) Cuisinart 'Chef's Classic' line before spending your hard earned dollars on any Calphalon lines below Calphalon Tri-Ply."
4,Its a Calphalon,"After reading the previous review, I was hesitant to pick this up, but decided to take a chance. Thank goodness, I had a different experience. Mine had the Calphalon, made in Ohio stamp at the bottom like the other Calphalon cookware. Granted, the metal was not as thick or heavy as the commercial or professional, the Calphalon quality is evident. And for the price of 9.99, and lifetime warrantee, it's a steal. I liked it enough to buy 2 more as gifts.."
1,Not what I was expecting,"Por degracia no es lo que yo imaginaba ,soy originario de Durango y no lo volveria a comprarUnfortunately is not what I expected ,Durango is my Hometown ,I would not buy this dvd again"
5,Golf Instruction,Best single book on how to play golf. Bob Toski and Jim Flick are the best golf instructors ever. The book details the whole golf experience from beginning to end. Good for beginners and experienced players. Much of what is in the book is used today by most golf instructors including drills for muscle memory. This later edition has added reference to Dave Pelz early research. Dave Pelz's Short Game Bible is a must for every golf library as well.
4,THIS IS GOOD CHAIR MASSAGE,"I GOT THIS ONE,THINKING I COULD LEARN SOMETHING NEW. I DID NOT LEARN MUCH SINCE I'VE BEEN DOING CHAIR FOR SEVERAL YEARS,BUT IT'S A BEST CHAIR DVD ON THE MARKET. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CHAIR VHS,DVD AND BELIEVE ME NONE OF DVD THAT I HAD KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING,MORE LIKE FLY BY NIGHT AND TAKE YOUR MONEY. THIS ONE I CAN RECOMMEND TO THOSE WHO ARE NEW TO CHAIR."
5,Chair Massage,I purchased a copy for several of my massage therapist who have experience in table massage therapy but little chair massage. Great teaching tool on how to give a great therapeutic chair massage as well as tips on saving your hands. Best DVD on the market.
4,Great dvd for beginners,I learned a lot of great techniques from this DVD. I wished there was an advanced version with more deep tissue work. I've had chair massages before and some of the techniques that were done weren't in this video. Overall this DVD was easy to follow along and the quality was very professionally done.
5,Excellent work !!!,The documentary is very informative and lively presentation of a burning issue of genocide. An eye opener on the subject of genocide. The writer or/and presenter has done a great job. Congratulations !!!
2,"Pretty frame, horrible shipping","I bought this frame from Amazon's partner, Target.com, and the company that ships it for them (ITC) did such a poor job of packing the box that the glass was shattered by the time I received it. If you need a frame like this keep looking, unless you don't mind having to replace the glass immediately upon arrival. Still waiting for my refund..."
3,I don't know what I expected,"whatever I expected, I didn't get it. One thing I wanted desparately was to know more about Isol; the other was to understand Zephyr more fully. Neither happened. I have become so accustomed to character-driven science fiction that hard science fiction leaves me wanting. I learned more about the peripheral characters than I did about the main characters and that left me wanting more.Let me say that Robson is a very good writer. Even in my disappointment, she kept me reading--not a page turner, mind you, but an interesting read."
2,"Interesting early, boring fast.","I was really excited to read this book. While Ms. Robson is without doubt a capable writer, in Natural History she lingers too long in murkiness. This feel works well in the open but got tiresome quickly. Difficult to differentiate characters (or were they entities?). Extreme lack of dialogue. Zzzzz . . ."
3,Its a bit unrealistic for me,I like the book overall. I can tell by the other reviewers that it's the type of book for folks with a lot to say about cooking. I wanted to have ideas on how to use my new cookware. I found the recipes a bit over the top with a lot of veal(never a good idea) and unsavory/expensive/hard to obtain cuts of meat. I love the recipes I used but a lot of the book is useless to me. I am a mother of two young children and I enjoy cooking well and trying new things but this might be a book I need to shelve until later in life.
3,Le Creuset Cookbook,"The book received was not the original order, accepted in view of the factg the seller could not obtain the original request. Leter ordered the book original wanted from later visit to Amazon. Acceptable condition for used book."
1,worst cookbook,this is the dumbest cookbook i ordered. i was interested in using Le Creuset cook ware instead of receipes for food i would never in my lifetime be caught dead eating. Who in their right mind would even think of cooking the trash they present in the book. i would advice anyone to not buy this stupid book.
2,sign yo pitty on the runny kine,If your going to watch this movie please be cognizant of the fact that it is incoherent and pretty bad. It is a great rental but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you like dumb fun this movie has it in spades.
1,Cost and Benefit,"Unfortunately, I can not recommend this film for the public in general. Low cost production and the script is poor.I admire Mel Brooks and he did much better in "" History of the world."" As Mel Brooks is a legend of comedy, I suggest this film for those interested in American movie history. In fact there is an explanation for this poor and evasive production."
3,"funny, but not the same","I bought this and was disappointed. It's got the original sketch's put to a cartoon, with sound effects put to it."
2,eh...,"I'm gonna say that this isn't a bad strategy guide, though it is far from the best I've seen.I've looked through it and it covers the maps, levels, and enmies fairly well. And it looks like it would do the job. The problem is that the actual game isn't much fun, mostly because of its gameplay. The guide isn't organized all that greatly, but it will do the job if you are stuck somewhere (yeah, it doesn't give away too many secrets)."
1,What happened to GIS data,"I purchased this on the title of GIS support, but after the introduction, there is no mention of how to build maps from GIS data.It is also only about the web service that Microsoft sells, nothing about MapPoint the product for the desktop. It is also very basic.This is a reprint of an article from C# Today from 2003 - before the current 2004 version was released."
5,Mizuno Slider stays & protects,"I really like this knee pad for softball. I have tried other brands, but the Mizuno Slider really stays in place. The protection is great for sliding on the gravel laden fields we play softball on. The pad is not bulky or binding either. I am not the biggest guy at 6ft 175lbs., but it fits perfect and doesn't move around during my outfield efforts.Not being sold in pairs is not a problem. I only need one because I only slide on one leg anyway. Frankly, I am appreciative that they package separately so I don't have to pay for two. The price is cheap enough you could easily buy more. Mine has lasted 2 seasons and is still going strong."
4,Mizuno Slider Kneepad,Fit my daughter well for softball this year. Took a little long to be shipped with paying for $7.95 s&h when the pad was cheaper than that.
5,Perfect,This was exactly what we were looking for. My son uses them for volleyball instead of the usual bulky knee pads.
3,Only One kneepad,"Would have been nice to know that I was only gettng one knee pad, then I could have ordered two n the same colour."
5,Perfect for my beginning slider,"My daughter joined her travel softball team this year and was so excited to learn to slide. This pad is perfect for her. She slides all the time in it and has gotten no scratched up knees. Plus it is not bulky like some of the pads can be, so it doesn't slow her down or interfere with fielding. I strongly recommend this pad."
1,Save your money,"The very first time I used my new sliding pad, I ripped open the same old hairless, tanless patch of skin I was trying to protect. It did nothing for me."
3,"Nice, but only one","The slider kneepad is a nice material, fits well, bends and for the most part protects, but be aware that this is a single knee pad, so if you were planning on using both your knees, you need to either buy 2 or purchase a different pair."
5,Fabulous music by one of America's greatest composers,"This disc is full of some of the most interesting and beautiful compositions by one of American's greatest composers. Every piece is both delightful and challenging, and each rewards repeat listening. Some of these pieces needed some time for me to grow into them, but I very fond of all them now. Others I found to be terrific right away. You mileage may vary!By the way, the performances are spectacular. It is difficult to imagine the possibility of performances with greater charm and commitment. The players believe in every note, and play it all with superb confidence and musicianship."
1,didn't send total order,My order arrived one month after the order and furthermore the order was incomplete (they only sent 1 of 3 books ordered). They never let me know. I had to email them to find out where the others were and now they are out of stock!!!! AMEN
3,Good Introduction To Brazilian Music (Lambada),"Good dance mix album with good Brazilian performers: Chico De Oliveira, A. Lia Bright, and Peter Columbus. I am very much a fan of Brazilian music."
1,Returning this dud,"Received this as a gift last night and if you own this, I hope yours works better than mine. Charged the battery overnight as directed and this afternoon I attempted to use the ""Professional Nail Salon."" It fits nicely in the hand. That's the only positive I can say about this product. Yes 6 ""heads"" are included, but not even one would remain in the ""Professional Nail Salon"" for even a minute. The suckers repeatedly flew out of the tool, flying all over the room and driving me nuts. I think I'll pull out my Dremel flexible shaft and try that instead to finish the job I tried to begin today. At least I know the drill bits remain firm in that one until I want them removed!"
1,"Nice idea, if it worked","I bought this because of the clever design. It worked for about a week. I called the manufacturer, and they said replacement bulbs were $15 plus $7 shipping. Apparently the bulb is custom made for this product, and you can't get it anywhere else.Great idea, but at $22 a week the entire family can use a brand new toothbrush every day!"
1,Trademark Ripoff,"This device of dubious microbiological value is illegally using the trademark DentaPure which is owned by MRLB International, Inc. MRLB International Inc. does manufacture professional antimicrobial products for use in dental offices. This product is not in anyway related to MRLB Internationals EPA registered antimocrobial products."
1,Waste of money,"As a PhD qualified microbiologist, I feel it is my duty to point out the pointlessness of this device. While it is true that a toothbrush can contain ""millions"" of bacteria, so does the mouth of every single individual on the planet. Provided that you are healthy, and that you are using the toothbrush as intended, the bacteria that can be found on a toothbrush will pose little or no risk to you and your family. Think of it logically, if there was a significant risk of disease due to use of a toothbrush, wouldn't a lot more of us be sick?Dont waste your money on this product - by a new toothbrush."
1,Don't waste your time,"I actually ""Rate"" this a Zero"")""... This wasn't even a good short story...Didn't realize this was only a 24 min. film... Dreamworks should be ashamed...Unfortunately, no do-overs...This could have been taken much further in the story line...BTW... This was being kind..."
1,Very disappointing,"my son loved the original full lenght movie, Kung Fu Panda.The previews hawked 'Secrets' as 'Po's next greatest adventure'.Pardon my assumption, but I kind of expected another full length movie.Instead it was all of 20 minutes of content, consisting of 2 minute vignettesof key scenes from each of the furious five's previous lives.I'd return it if i could. I feel like it was a cheap trick."
4,Furious Five,Es un disco el cual no ha llegao a mi pais... bueno y recomendado para el coleccionista de la saga...
4,Aunt buying for nephew,"DVD was in great condition. Just like new. I did have to wait over 3 weeks to receive it, but I think that was a postal issue, since we have expreienced those before."
3,I expected to be a hit,"I ordered this because my 5 year old loves Kung Fu Panda and reading the reviews of this one I thought he was going to love itbut he saw it only once and never again in two months, maybe latter he'll like it. BTY I love Kung Fu Panda too."
3,Very short movie,"Just be sure you know its not a full length movie. Its cute how the bunnies wanted Po to tell more and that Po was a good teacher after all. The kids, 5yrs, didn't like Tigress so much since she was very destructive and seemed scarey until you found out the ""monster"" was a little tiger. But lead up was a bit scarey. Lots of hitting and punching, but its a kung fu movie. Very cute way to learn about the beginnings of these characters. I could watch a whole movie about monkey or viper. Animation the same as movie so it is very good, just too short... I wanted more of it! If kids are little, its a good one to pop in and say....after this brush your teeth! And it will be a fast one!"
5,Big and mythic ...,"A wonderful, personal story that tells of our Western cultural roots through the eyes of those who have lived and nurtured them. Rowe is a wonderful storyteller whose language is reminiscent of Rushdie's best (without the tiresome irony), and whose insights and mythic tales delight with a too-often forgotten sense of wonder. Nicaea is highly recommended for those who require intelligent writing."
1,Code Not Available,Please do not waste your money on this book. The link to the complete code -zip file- listed in the eDoc is invalid and the site no longer exists. What a waste of money and time. I am in the process of contacting my credit card company to help me remedy this situation.
1,"Didn't work, at all.","It works for less than a minute and then the blades stop spinning. At first I thought it was just the battery included with the package, but after a new one the same thing occurs. Too bad. The size of this product is great for those of us with big noses who find the other shavers too unwieldy to really get at the hairs. But unfortunately, it doesn't work."
2,HP is failing its customers,"About 4 years ago I switched from Palm to HP. I've owned several Ipaqs and the 2795 is the latest. I must warn you: this device has a variety of bugs, the most annoying of which is the fact that the battery periodically drains down, leaving you with Zero power.You would think that HP would put a fix on line or would instruct its call-center staff on how to solve the problem. No such luck. The call center staff are unable to solve the problem; they keep telling ytou to install the latest BIOS, which I did immediately upon purchasing the device.So, I have to say: unless HP fixes the various problems with this device, CAVEAT EMPTOR.I'm about ready to buy a Palm, despite the high switching costs."
2,HP Pocket PC,"I purchased item to replace a Sony Clie PDA. Being accustomed to the Clie, I found this PDA very confusing. It does noy have the features I expected from a PDA. I was unable to obtain an instruction manual. Up to this moment the unit is completely useless to me."
2,hx 2795 IPAC,"I wanted to get the IS organizational support for Outlook on the office LAN and switched to Windows PC from a Palm 515. So far, I have found the finger print reader/password feature cumbersome and have quit using it.I now find I was spoiled by Palm. The IPAC is alot less intuitive to use and has alot less third party software (most troublesome being no ""Doc's to Go"". Search function is harder. No vibrator in lieu of ringer. Doesn't keep reminding you of appointments (catch the first ring). Do like the bluetooth for wireless internet access; works very well.Am still learning; hope my impressions improve. Right now, wish I had studied features more before switching."
3,USB port is a big problem,"This camera has great features [and a 247 page CD-ROM manual] but is also easy to use without all the special settings. However, less than 2 weeks after I got it, the USB port broke while attaching the cable to download images - this happened even when using the supplied cable & being careful to insert it in the correct way. Now I may have to send it to their one US warranty center, in NJ, for repair. There is another review here with a similar complaint, & others elsewhere [now that I've had this problem & looked], so it's obviously not an isolated problem."
3,USB port broke easily,"i purchase a casio exilim pro P600 last month the camera its good i enjoy taking pictures with it,,the image quality is perfect but sometimes if u make your own settings it will give u noise on your results....the down side just less than a month the USB port went-off/detach from the PCB board now i can't use the camera to load my pictures or view it on the video monitor...hope casio can see this problem so that they can improve the mounting of their USB port"
4,It's Nautica!,Price is unbeatable. Just one thing that the color is not exactly red like the picture. It kinda darker but oh well i still love it.
5,mushroom mayhem!,"I dont care what anyone else says, the other side of this album is amazing! I've never heard such a human element in their work. The songs switch between sad to comically mishivious but the tempo always reigns sumpreme."
4,album that shows you what infected is.,"I do love this cd but it almost gets to be too much cuz this cd is when infected mushroom decided to use their special effects guitars and make all there music with that. I liked it better before they even came to america. They had better music and tighter beats and more interresting storylines. I do reccomend to get this cd tho, it probably has the best vibe to it other than any other one."
4,What if...,"I just picked this book up because I thought the premise was interesting. I am so happy I did. This book answers the eternal question ""what if..."" and makes us see that the ""grass really is always greener on the other side"".Written with wry humor and some very poignant moments (especially for those of us who let ""him"" get away) this book makes us think that what we have here, today is o.k.I absolutely loved the writing style (airy and down to earth) and as previously mentioned, thought the premise was excellent and very well rounded out. An absolute fun to read and I hope this auhtor comes back with more, more, more."
2,Not Happy,Got the unit and installed it. The outdoor temp is usually 10 to 12 degrees high. Installed under the eve so it is out of direct sunlight. Contacted the company but the have never responded. Should have bought a better one or stuck to the old mercury.
3,remote temp sensor quit working,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my father. The rain gauge works fine and is very accurate. The remote temperature sensor quit working after two months, so now it is just a rain gauge."
5,Best type of rain gauge!,"We have been 100% happy with this rain gauge. One of the best reasons for spending more money and buying one like this is cold weather. Whenever I bought one of the plastic or glass ones that you need to dump after each rain, I would always forget to empty it. Then either the rain amount would be wrong, or it would freeze with water in it and then break."
1,Not so good.,"This didn't last 3 mos. I made no attempt to return or exchange, but I was not happy with the quality of the product. The outside temperature gauge broke within a couple of months."
3,Interesting,Very detailed! It is very informative right to the tiniest details about the church and all the difficulties it went through.
2,Biased,"An easy reading summary of church history, summary is the key word. Do not expect to use this book as any type of historical reference. There are just too many details missing. The author's writing is also very biased. Even a devout Catholic as myself could easily ascertain the author was more focused on making the church look positive that he was in telling history. For example his discussion of the inquisition argued that it 'wasn't that bad' and a ""considerable advance in the treatment of criminals"". By the end of the book I was so distrustful that his words conveyed a realistic portrayal of history I made notes and researched events myself.Lastly he jumps around chronologically a bit, making the reader have to look back and forth between pages."
2,Flimsy - you get what you pay for,"This is a flimsy little cutter. The ruler is in the wrong direction- instead of being across the top it goes down the side, parallel to the cut. So say if you want to trim a picture to 8""x 10"" you have to measure it and mark it first, then trim it. You don't really see exactly where the cut is going to be once you lower the arm, and since the cutter is so flimsy the pictures tend to move or slide out of the way once you lower the arm. It takes 2 people to be able to use it semi-smoothly. I will probably move to a different type of cutter. For small infrequent jobs it will do ok, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wants it for higher volume. Bottom line, the old adage holds true: You get what you pay for: You don't pay much = You don't get much!"
5,Has Lasted longer than Some Expect,I've had this model cutter for over 14 years. I've used it for hundreds of projects using dozens of different media. I very much prefer the cheap & available straight blades to rotary blades. My model is beginning to show its age and wear. Small nicks in the guide bar are beginning to get big enough to catch the blade. I will not hesitate to replace it with the same elegant machine!
4,This is my favorite personal paper slicer.,"I have bought three of these over the years because it is my favorite personal paper cutter. It allows you to measure easily, and you can use it to cut larger sheets of paper than the standard slicers. It uses standard razor blades, which really keeps the cost down, and the blades are very easy to replace. Also, you can use both corners of the blade to lengthen the usefulness. After a lot of use (two or three years) it doesn't cut quite as straight anymore."
3,Great for the price you pay,"Overall I'm very happy with this purchase - although it did take a few screw-ups before I figured out exactly where the cut line was going to be, as it doesn't seem to be where you would expect it. It gets the job done, and comes w/ extra blades too, so that was nice. I would give it 4 stars, but the thing tends to get hung up when you slide it back into the starting position and if you don't pay attention you start your cut already into the photo paper rather than starting at the edge."
2,beware,"For the price, I was expecting much more. I give this thing 2 months and then it's going in the trash. All plastic and only cuts in one direction. Keep looking..."
1,Couldn't give Zero Stars,"Not a review of the item really, because I can't get it delivered. I had an error in the shipping address, and consequently the item went to the wrong place. This vendor has been AWFUL! in trying to get this situation resolved. The only response I got from ""Rachel"" in customer service was ""that was the address we got from Amazon, and that's where it got shipped"". They won't help me get the item to the right address, and won't respond to emails or phone calls.I strongly recommend avoiding this vendor based on their pathetic and awful customer service."
3,miracle in the wilderness,"I love the movie but i needed it to have closed caption, which it did not have. I will be more careful in future purchases."
4,Interesting take on the Christmas story - well presented.,"This is a really neat way to present the Christmas story. It's kind of far-fetched in places, but still fun and thought-provoking to watch. It has good action but isn't too violent for younger kids."
5,Great Movie,"This was a movie my husband had wanted for so long, but all I could find was on VHS. I was happy to see it finally on DVD. This movie is so good for anytime of the year not just at Chistmas time."
5,Figure Skating Rarity,"If you're a figure skater and are interested in the history of the sport, this book is a little self published gem. The author was a serious skater, not a competitor though, and as serious about his sport as any rabid NFL fan. Technically the sport has moved on since this book was published, but it's full of gossip, opinion, and techniques that have been lost to history.For adult figure skaters only. I can't imagine a kid skater or parent caring about this."
3,What you need to know to get started in the industry,I have read this entire book a couple times and have found it to be very informative. I have used this book to create policies for the security company I run and it has never failed me. The one draw back is that some of this information is getting to the point where it needs to be updated. The best thing in the book is the wealth of forms in the back of the book that can be used for mosst type of advances and other day to day tasks that you run into in the industry.
1,Mindless Repetition,"If you listen to the 30 second samples set to endless looping, you'll have heard the entire CD.I bought this based on the samples and their very heavy, very deep bass lines. Little did I suspect that there was nothing more to *any* of the tracks here than what you hear on the samples.I imagine the ""artists"" were very high when they made this, and if you're very high when you listen to it you may be amused. Otherwise, forget it."
3,Really big,"Ordered this for my husband who is a fairly big man, but this watch was so big we returned it. It is beautiful and has great features, but BIG."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"Airport book is inconsistent and mind-numbing right out of the gate (where were this woman's editors??), careens downhill from there. Just terrible."
4,A different Jury....,"""The old Wine Shades"" is not the usual Jury detective story. It is a puzzling story at first because the reader is not sure there really is a mystery that needs to be solved. It takes awhile to separate the facts from the fiction - and it involves Jury's friends as usual. I did enjoy the story after I got into what was happening."
4,And Now For Something Different,"This is not your normal Martha Grimes/Jury novel. For one thing, he remains in legal limbo ... where we left him in the prior novel. For another, the string theory meme has made its way into Jury's world. [Physics is quite a departure for Grimes.] And the ambiguity of his place in the world seems to have put Jury slightly off his game.Some scenes are classic Grimes, such as when Melrose Plant et al get involved. But their involvement feels more contrived than normal.If you like Grimes, you'll like the book.If you've never read Grimes ... don't start here. Start at the beginning!"
2,In What Dimension Was This Book Written?,"This Grimes mystery was a big disappointment. I have read all of her books and did not expect this. Please don't read this as a first Grimes book. The discussions about superstring/quantum/mechanical/M theories were okay with me--I read that stuff anyway. The dog was okay--I have several and I know they think and that they have stories to tell. But please...they have not ""called time"" in the afternoon in English pubs for a number of years. Also, what was the point of the bloody slipper prints? Why has our friend Jury suddenly become so gullible that he doesn't check details? The use of outdated forensic technology, or rather the lack of up-to-date technology, is disappointing. Everyone is snippy and grouchy--they have all turned into boors. In addition, there are way too many spelling and grammatical errors. Please, Martha, you can do better than this!"
1,Sorry Martha,"This wasn't one of her best. I love the Richard Jury series and have been a loyal fan for many years. The characters are like old friends and while I loved being with them again, the story and the ending were not satisfying at all. There were a few laughs, I'll grant you that, but for the most part, I was puzzled throughout. Also, I am contemplating writing a letter to the publishers. I was incredibly distracted by the numerous editing, spelling and grammatical errors in the book, to the point that I was actually starting to circle them!"
1,A Further Descent into Inanity,"Well, I started the book and I forced myself to finish it. I only wish Ms Grimes had not demonstrated the same tenacity in writing ""The Old Wine Shades"". The Jury series was, in its early days, compelling and highly readable but the last few installments have been formulaic and absurd. I believe Ms Grimes now simply uses a template and fills the blanks therein when she authors each new volume. We all know to expect some new waif in distress with an animal sidekick of uncommon intelligence. Her characters are caricatures of what a North American perceives the English to be. Perhaps she is repositioning the Jury series as crime fiction's answer to the ""Carry On"" movies. I can see it now.. Sid James as Jury, Kenneth Williams as Melrose Plant......"
1,"Unfortunately, dreadful!","I've really enjoyed this series for so many years. I don't think anyone who starts the series with this book would ever get to any of the others. It was just goofy. I adore dogs, but Mungo the brilliant dog revealing his thoughts and motives to us was silly. The book seemed like an exercise in creative writing just to see how things would go. It had no ending which truly appalled me. It was wicked short. There are only about 339 pages, something like that. Lots of blank space on these 339 pages. Lots of short chapters. The ""plot"" was just ridiculous.I know if I read this review or any of the other incredulous reviews, I'd still buy the book anyway since I've been buying these books for so many years, but I'm warning you now, and I'm very sorry to say this, you'll wish you'd skipped this one. It really is dreadful."
2,Very disappointed long time MG fan,"I'm a long time fan of Martha Grimes, Richard Jury, Melrose Plant and the entire crew. This book was a BIG disappointment. I hung on through the anthropomorphism of Mungo (the dog) which really tested reality. I was waiting for that surprising, clever ending that would make everything worthwhile. It didn't come. The story just stopped. Nothing....all of a sudden an epilogue that didn't wrap up anything either.Very disappointed. I'm not sure what that was about. Did she just get tired and decide she'd written too many words?"
1,What happened to the car?,"I don't think any of the other reviewers have asked: In addition to the other ""mysteries"" presented by this horrible book, no one at all ever asks about the car!!! Did the police ever have it towed? Did the police ever issue a speeding ticket for it? Was it ever exported on a legitimate shipper? Did the car ever come to the attention of the police in any way after the woman, boy, and dog disappeared?And Martha Grimes never tells us about the condition of the dog upon its return. Did it look well-fed, rested, and have a glossy coat, like someone had been taking care of it? Or did it look hungry, tired, and have mangled fur, like it had been outside and had walked a lot. What's next for Martha Grimes and the dog? Is she going to have Sherlock Holmes examine the dog and tell where it's been?Don't purchase this book and save your money. Better yet, don't read it at all and save yourself the time and effort!"
1,Not her best work,I've been a fan since 1983. That's when I discovered Martha's Richard Jury series. The Old Wine Shades was such a disappointment.It was not well thought out. Mrs. Wasserman didn't figure at all.The platonic tension between Carole Anne and Jury wasn't there.What's with this two page chapters bit?
1,What?,"I love this series - but not this book. I'll never stop reading Martha Grimes but this was so boring, my eyes refused to stay open."
3,Good enough for me to want to read more of her work,"Granted, this is not your typical mystery -- but I enjoy it when an author experiments. The book was a fast read, with engaging characters and a great hook. Maybe, for some, the pay-off wasn't so great... But that's how real-life crime is sometimes. And who knows... Maybe Jury will find a way to make things right sometime down the line. The author may write a sequel to this particular case. I'm glad that I read the book. It introduced me to an author I haven't read before, and I'm looking forward to catching up with the rest of her series. As for the storyline, I found all of the quantum physics theories, etc. to be fascinating."
1,Never Again!,"I will neve again get sucked into buying one of her books. I should have stopped reading them 4 or 5 ago but kept hoping that she'd change. This is formula writing at it's worse. I agree with the reviewer who asked if she really wrote this one. It's the same old people doing the same old thing in the same old places. The only thing that changes is the plot and in this book it's ludicrous.Martha, if you're reading this just know I'll never buy another one of your books. It's a shame too because in the beginning they were delightful. Oh and get back to your editor - too many errors and inconsistancies."
2,A Little More Reality Please,"Martha Grimes, one of my all time favorite authors, takes what should have been a great story and turns it into a hodgepodge of science and fantasy.A better title should have been 'Mungo, The Wonder Dog'. Next time, lets leave the heroics and thinking to Jury and friends, not to a dog.Also, what is this obsession lately with having young girls who freely talk to Jury, a complete stranger?"
2,It really IS a dog!,"Of course, one of the main characters is a dog -- and so is this book. I really enjoy Martha Grimes' early works but this one is a huge disappointment. It's very sad -- I hope she's not written out."
1,disappointed,A decent beginning and plot development then left to plod through a poor structure and no ending. I'm not kidding. There was no ending.
2,Go to the library!,"I usually love all of the Richard Jury mysteries. This one sucks. There is no conclusion to this story. I can only assume that there will be another book to complete this one. I would not mind, had I known up front, but to wade through chapters and chapters of various theories, to no real conclusion, is so annoying.The only reason I gave it a two star rating, instead of a one, is all of the usual wonderful Jury characters are in the book. This however doesn't save it.Trust me; borrow this book, don't buy it. That's what I am going to do for the next one."
1,It Ended?,"This is the first time I have ever reviewed anything on here, but I have just finished The Old Wine Shades and am stunned. First of all, I'm reading and when I turn the page, it says Epilogue. Eiplogue...you're kidding! I didn't realize it had ended to have an eiplogue. On top of that, there is no ending. Nothing. If there is a hidden meaning, would someone please explain it? I can't believe I read this book and suffered through the superstring theory nonsense, and it has no ending. The only thing I will say for this book is at least she doesn't kill off any children. That was my main gripe with Martha Grimes' books, it seemed like at least one child was always killed in each book. Overall, I am very disappointed in this book and that I took the time to read it."
1,Weirder and weirder,"Ms. Grimes manages to write a mystery with no conclusion. This is by far the weirdest book in the Richard Jury series. The book contains way too much filler discussing ""string theory"" and other arguments surrounding the world of physics, having very precious little to do with the story line. The best thing I can say about this series is that she should have let Jury die several books ago when she had the chance. I will not be buying anymore of her books."
2,Didn't completely hate it,"This was my first Martha Grimes novel, and quite possibly my last. I found this book to be very hard to slog through (I can put a Sue Grafton away in about 4 hours). I really didn't appreciate the constant references to previous works (at least I think they referenced previous works, there was no explanation).No, the dog didn't belong in the book, but was the most entertaining part!"
1,Read this at night if you're an insomniac.,"What WAS Martha Grimes thinking? After 80 pages of physics explanations, I fell asleep for the night. In the morning I gave it another try and fell back asleep after one chapter. This Jury mystery is easily as unexciting as her other non-Jury fiction, notably End of the Pier. One more non-starter like this one, and her Jury books will be off my list, too."
2,Good Book,This book was a great next book in the series. It was nice and comfortable visiting with old friends. I am glad I got it.
2,"Drat, not her best","I've always loved Martha Grimes's work, and was eagerly looking forward to this one. Alas, this is clever, but not her best. Especially, as another reviewer mentioned, the business with the dog. Please, I'd thought we'd gotten past that sort of thing.No need to mention the plot, no need for spoilers. Unsatisfying, indeed. Finally, and this may be from watching too many CSIs, but once you've read it, think about the ending -- and the dog's presence -- and testing for evidence. Couldn't that have been done? I can't say more because it will give the plot away. Hopefully some of you will understand what I'm trying to say LOL.Suspending of disbelief is something readers usually have to do, but Ms. Grimes definitely has tried this fan's patience with this one."
1,I liked the kids and the dog,"Pointless, plotless, tensionless and hard to follow. Tilda, the wise little girl (a Grimes staple) and Mungo the rational dog (a new development) were the only entertaining parts of this book. I'm a fan from way back. I had some disappointments with some of the later books of this series but this is first one I continued to read only in hopes of it getting better. It didn't."
3,It may be wiser to stick to the earlier Jury novels...,"I love Martha Grimes' work... So I hate to be writing a negative review of her book.Her writing style was enjoyable and the opening of her book was quite gripping. However, the book quickly frays into a pile of loosely related stories and almost none of them are actually resolved in a satisfactory way.Oh, and there's a psychic dog. For Pete's sake."
2,where's the ending???,"While I am a big Grimes fan (love the Richard Jury series, and have read them all), I actually found this book to be rather a frustration. You see, the beginning really pulls the reader in--there's this fantastic tale Jury is told at a pub, and the story is rather a brain teaser. Well, and the intensity just builds from there...keeps you guessing the whole time...you stick through page after page of suspenseful dialogue between the characters (sometimes it feels like the characters are talking in circles around the plot)...takes you through all of this, only to drop you right after that. Yes, that's right...the book just drops off. Doesn't really give you much of an ending, which is frustrating to no end, since this book is really a story within a story. Rather a disappointment to have stuck with it through over 41 chapters, and then have it just fizzle out. Quite unsatisfying, that.""Man walked into a pub...""(Bah humbug to that! Where's the ending???)"
3,"Personally, I liked the dog","I have to admit that I was disappointed in the ending, although I didn't have any trouble understanding it. There were some errors and, to be sure, some of the book bordered on fantasy, but I liked it, and I thought the dog and his feline housemate were a lot of fun. Of course, I enjoy Rita Mae Brown and Sneaky Pie and the Cat Who series etc, also. I would have liked to see more resolution to the book, and I was a little skeptical that there was no way of solving the case. After all, these kids were no dummies and could have easily provided more aid to Jury. I will read the next one when I come across it, but I don't see me rushing to buy it."
2,This book was bizarre!,"Ordinarily I love this author's books. I have every one of her books. But this book was very strange. The book was not up to her usual standard at all. I won't give away any spoilers, but the plot was just too far fetched for me, what little there was of it. I loved her last book Belle Ruin. Maybe she should concentrate on that series instead."
2,How disappointing,"Ms. Grimes must be getting tired of writing the Richard Jury books. The dog was just ridiculous. This series is not supposed to be science fiction or fantasy.The early books are terrific, but the last few have been disappointing, with this one being the worst. Perhaps the author should just wind up the series with the next one and call it a day."
2,Maverick,I have read and liked all the Richard Jury mysteries. This one I did not like. Too much of the book dealt with Physic's theories and not enough basic detective work. I was disappointed in it.
1,Don't even spend the penny to buy it used,"I was a devoted fan of Ms Grimes' Richard Jury series and even wrote to her years ago expressing how much I enjoyed her mysteries. However, something has changed over the past few years. It's as if someone else is writing these books, someone who does not know how to craft an interesting, sensible story that can hold readers' attention. The story moves from quantum mechanics to sentient canines to an ending that leaves one stymied. The writing is what the British might call ""twee,"" just too cute and sickeningly self-absorbed.If you're interested in reading any of Ms Grimes' Richard Jury novels, stick to the early ones. They're first-rate mysteries. This book was my last attempt to find once more the author whose books I loved so much."
4,Harrowing,"Enjoyed, as I always do, the banter between Jury and Plant. Martha Grimes has developed some interesting child characters in the past and their are a couple of good ones in this book.I found Grimes' discussion of stories--our dependence on them and their tendency to involve their listeners--hugely interesting. I enjoyed the book a great deal."
2,"Wait for the paperback, and then wait a little longer","This is a hard book to review, because it's enjoyable (the characters are like comfortable old shoes, and the dialogue is often very funny)BUT the plot is ridiculous, the perp's motives and methods make no sense,and the ending is really, really, really unsatisfying. Ms. Grimes resorts to making a dog -- who plays a prominent role here -- a sentient being and an action hero. Give me a break."
1,"This is a no-star, very bad book","I finished it to see how awful it would be, but felt like throwing it on the floor when I did finish it. If she were not already a recognized writer, the author would not have been able to get this in print."
3,Kindle version,"Sadly, the resolution of some of the images for the Kindle version of this text is too low to allow me to see some of the finer details - notably the numbers are indecipherable."
5,great calculator,"I have been using a TI-85 since 1993. It served me fantastically! When looking to update my hardware I was looking for something to last me the next 15 years. While I have obviously left many models pass me by in the last decade and a half, I looked to either the Ti-89 Titanium or Voyage 200 to be my next calculator. In the end the features between the two seemed very similar to me. AT and SAT test requirements would have pointed me more toward that Ti-89t but that not being a requirement, I opted for the larger screen the Voyage 200 provides me. Overall, I love my choice and have only begun to tap its abilities. My only regrets are that I waited 15 years to upgrade... that, and I do miss printed documentation (although the provided PDF is easily searchable)."
5,An excellent product.,It is easy to use and it provides a lot of functions that you as a student should need. I liked the price and I also like how it looks like.
5,Great Calculator,"Besides being able to locate the eigenvalues of any complex linear system and find the true triple integral of e^x*xcos(2x)+sin(yz) with respect to x, y, and z, respectively, this calculator is great for any student matriculating to an engineering college. I also use it to calculate alimony payments."
5,A Great Help,"Having only used a TI-82 before getting this, I was pretty much out of the loop on Texas Instrument calculating. I got it in order to help me in my Calculus class in college. Specifically, I figured it would be a good tool for checking whether my answers were right and to graph fancy functions.After getting it, I was instantly impressed. The icon-based desktop makes navigating through all the features and programs much easier. The LCD is very easy to read and very big compared to other calculators I've used. It can do everything I need it to do, and more. The included USB link cable makes it easy to upload new software and updates to the calculator as well. I easily upgraded the OS on mine from 2.07 to 2.08 without a hitch.After getting this calculator, I would highly suggest you take a look over at TI's website and look for updates and add-ons. There is a lot to explore with these high-end TI calculators, and the Voyage 200 is just another great milestone in the TI line."
3,A good tool,"The calculator should use the same power concept of a notebook/tablet...USB charging instead of physical batteries. And if this can be designed into an App, downloadable into PC devices, much better."
2,NOT for new users!!,"A calculator so sophisticated with the worst display they could use. With the actual LCD displays, sensitive screens and rechargeable NiCd batteries, is out of my understanding why TI still uses this kind of display. Even cell phones have better displays to insert and show data. The contrast is not good enough and if you are under a filament lamp you can see the numbers with a ghost (two times the screen, due the shadow). If you use a notebook, cell phone and digital camera daily, you will not like this product. The resolution is not so good for the ""textbook like"" and to the ""Advanced Large Screen Graphing"" slogan.The pdf documentation is bad too, since I CANNOT PRINT the necessary pages."
5,Calculadora,"Excelente, era lo que esperaba y me funcionó perfectamente, ya se está utilizando en la universidad. Cumplió con lo requerido. Instrumento para el estudiante que se necesita en las clases."
1,Godschild,The voyage 200 is no help I could not use it because I can't undersTand how to use it I wasted money.
3,Too bulky and nothing special,"Nothing special, really. I dont like how keyboard keys/functions are chosed and placed. The software interface is not convinient (say, changing simple default options like # formats, or finding a func in the catalog, or simply browsing is just painful). Awkward error messages with no hint to help (there is no any built-in help/reference at all).And it's REALLY BULKY for a calculator - i mean it - people make fun of me when they see it (and professors during exams get suspicious that it could be some kind of computer)."
1,"Buy it, if you wanna have a BETA version",System hangs a lot of times...Afterwards it restarts and all your data is gone...And uses a very large amount of power... Means you have to buy lots of batteries...You better chose TI-92plus...
3,It works but not in great condition,"Condition was not as ""good"" as portrayed. It works but looks a little banged up!"
5,Best Uganda Reference out there,"This was used as a reference for a paper on Uganda. Although some of the information is dated the book is accurate and between it, current news articles, the State Department website, and the CIA website you can get a pretty accurate picture of the country. There was no other reference out there that did a better job."
1,Rough on nails hard on hands,"This clipper is difficult to use, very non-ergonomic. Also the blades are rough and not very sharp."
4,Blossoming Tree,"This excellent compilation of virtually every phase of Porcupine Tree's career with Delerium is in many ways definitive for those who aren't dyed in the wool Tree devotees. The best songs from the group's first two albums are included while the worst are thankfully omitted. And there are many important inclusions as well--the lush and beautiful ""Stars Die"" as well as several songs that had been previously unreleased. My only gripe with this otherwise stellar release is that several killer PT tunes have been left off, for instance ""Burning Sky,"" ""Moonloop,"" and ""It Will Rain for a Million Years."" Room could've been made for these tracks by eliminating a few inessentials like ""Men of Wood,"" ""Fuse the Sky"" (really just a pastisch of ""The Sky Moves Sideways"") and ""Dark Matter."" But it's still a terrific document of the Tree as it blossomed into prog superstardom."
5,There is a sound you don't hear in most modern music and the Delerium years has it.,"Porcupine tree isn't what it used to be. A great band but it one time captured that unique nich of technical music with a classical flair. Not as complex as ELP or Yes but something more basic and real. You still hear hints of that it the current material Porcupine tree generates but don't expect this to be a rocker...it's simpler smoother and more classical sounding than the punched up Dark Planet stuff. Don't get me wrong, I think both sounds are great, I just think it's ashame there isn't more of this sound still being made out there...I guess it's the same old saying...""comerical potential""...FZ"
4,New Progressive...,"This group was recommended to me so I bought this album hoping for a god sampling of material...it is. This is ""new"" progressive rock. Is great to see that Prog rock is still there. This album has a great flow and some powerful songs. I wish that taped commentary between songs was not there, they should have just allowed the flow. This album is good quality work."
3,Too much moaning,"The first one of this series was very good, but the second one was simply unremitting gloom. I didn't even finish the third one, because I was tired of Nick's continual moaning about how bad his life was."
2,There is little Hope,"These have to be the most depressing stories I have ever read. The first book in the series, Midshipnman's Hope, was stering and I rooted for Mr Seafort. The second book, Challenger's Hope, was the begining of the downward slide with Seafort brutlizing everyone and beating them. A real leader is not a Captain Bligh. This third book, Prisoner's Hope, does have good action sences, but by this time I was very tired of the yelling and crying and beating and moping. I started skimming to move past all of this to see what finally happens. I have to admit that the story is compelling and I want to see how they win (maybe, I hope) against the Fish. These books are like a really bad movie you stay up to watch, and at the end you ask yourself, why did I waste my time. And you answer, you hoped it would get better, and at times, it does, but you keep on watching because you want to see how it comes out in the end."
3,Enough with the tortured soul already!,"FIRST OF ALL IF YOU LIKE THIS SERIES CHECK OUT LOIS MCMASTER BUJOLDS VORKOSIGAN SAGA. IT IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER. Not That this was too bad a book, but I've read The still, and the first two books of this series and they've all been the same. Astounding circumstance thrust the hero into a no win situation, he agonizes more than is necessary, betrays his friends, and in the end prevails. Actually Nick Seafort isn't a very nice guy. He's always snarling at his friends being rude, bemoaning ""I've foresworn my oath"" and generally moping around. This series so far has only been redeemed by competent storytelling. I hope the rest of the series picks up a bit or I probably won't finish it. Oh yeah check out the vorkosigan saga - way better although the first book was a little thin."
2,Too much tortured soul,"This series is a painful one to read. Nick Seafort suffers from two problems: the typical hero's being in all the wrong places at the wrong time, and his personal and bizarre code with which he tortures himself at every turn. This story is worst than most, as more and more characters seem to have this trait of unbreakable personal codes for which any violation is unforgivable. It makes any character interactions painful to read as you wonder who will say or do the wrong thing to offend honor or duty and be eternally ostracized. The science fiction, however, is gripping. If Feintuch were to devote more to SF and less to gloom, he'd be fantastic."
3,Ranks 4 out of 4,I didn't dislike the book but having read all 4 of Seafort Saga I gave Fisherman a 5 because one finally understands the cause of the flaws in the central Character's personality. I gave the Midshipman and challenger 4 stars but one would hope he'd develop a better self awareness by the time of this event. The theory of times of Seafort is realistic given the youth of the Navy officers of they era as painted.I'm glad I started with Vol. #4 because it made the 1st two make more sense.
5,"book 3 of the Seafort saga is exciting, and well written","Recovering from injuries, seperated from all those he loves.Nicholas Seafort must stop a rebellion. No matter the costto himself, or his beliefs."
3,Uses a prior edition of the NASB .......,"I am rather disappointed with this Bible. This is, indeed, the New American Standard Bible (NASB); however, it is not the UPDATED edition of 1995. It is, rather, the NASB of 1977 (with all the ""thees"" and ""thous""). Not what I was expecting!This should have been made clear somewhere in the product description. I don't see how the publisher can release an ""expanded edtion"" without using the updated NASB. It just doesn't make sense!In any case, I just wanted to let any prospective know about this. :)"
1,HORRIBLE,"This bag does not stay closed. I thought the first time I used it I hadn't closed the zipper, so I tried again. Again it came open, spilling my bra out of the bag (using the delicate cycle in my washer). So I tried it a third time and again, it came open and my bra closure was tangled up in the mesh. Had I known this was a waste of money, I never would have bought it"
1,Bra bag did not work at all. Unzipped in the wash on first use.,"This did not work at all. This bra bag was a waste of money. I should have sent the 2 bags back; however I was sort of irritated and tired when I used them the first time and threw them away. Seriously everything came unzipped in the wash, so I just keep using my old beat up Tide bra bags."
3,Bra Wash Bag,Bag seems sturdy but will only hold one bra. The design is a bit awkward unless you throw it in the dryer. I prefer to line dry my bras and lingerie bags. I've purchased lingerie bags in department stores that are better and hold two or more bras. This was a disappointing purchase.
4,Only Works with a Safety Pin in Place,The first time I tried washing a bra in this bag the bra escaped. The zipper completely unzipped in the washing machine. So I read other people's comments and figured out that it will work if you use a safety pin to hold the zipper closed. So now I'm giving it four stars instead of just one. Without a safety pin it is completely worthless.~The Rebecca Review
1,I have to use safety pins to make it work,"The zipper doesn't stay closed. Every time I've used it, it's always found open and my bras in the washing machine. I tried stuffing the zipper down as far as it would go under the elastic zipper protector but nothing worked. I now used a safety pin to keep it closed."
1,You get what you pay for I guess,"I was not impressed with the product. I purchased 2 of these bags because it advertised that it was good for larger size bras where other similar products were not. However, on my first use both bags opened during the wash even set on delicate-low agitation. Completed defeated the purpose of using the bag at all."
1,Traps lint and broke apart after a few uses.,"I used to hand wash my bras and wanted to give a bra bag a try and was so disappointed with this purchase. It trapped so much lint and after less than a hand full of uses the stitching of the bag fell apart and the plastic piece inside that holds the shape of the bag came out. I couldn't use it anymore. Even though it didn't cost alot, I felt like I wasted my money. I ended up purchasing the Honey-Can-Do Lingerie Wash bag to replace it, which works great, doesn't trap lint and after using it for a year it still hasn't fallen apart."
2,Doesn't perform.,My bras keep coming out. I love the fact that it is mesh and doesn't snag with my other bras. But the bras come out. Need a better product now.
2,Bra Wash Bag,The zipper does not stay closed so anything in the bag just falls out. Totally useless!
2,Not that great...,"I think this product would be great if the zipper managed to stay closed. Whenever I pull this out of my front load washing machine, it is always open and the bras have fallen out during the wash."
2,"Not that great, fall apart","These are just ok. They do help to hold the shape of the bra while it's washing. I'm a D and I could fit 2 bras in there. They are difficult to fully zip and even more so to unzip, because the zipper ends up under a little elastic thingy and is hard to get to. The most disappointing thing for me was that the bags started to fall apart after what I thought was a minimal amount of use, on delicate cycle only. They have a wire inside and the seams came apart and the wire tries to fall out. Couldn't really recommend this."
5,lively atonal music,"This is not dry academic music but exciting music, performed by Charles Rosen with energy and surprises. It is great to hear Mr Carter's interview on the last track, talking about music.Here is the Man!"
3,Not the complete Soledad session!,"This disc is missing the opening numbers done by John Lee Hooker, Jr. He does songs like ""Superlover"" and ""Cross Cut Saw."" ""I'm your Superlover baby...gonna make all kinds of super love to you"" is what he sings. If you ain't got that line on the disc, I'll stick to my LP version. HeHeHe..."
2,Zoom Broke 3x,"The pictures were very high quality, when the camera was working. My only complaint there was that even zoomed in, the objects of most pictures at a distance looked ant like. The camera's zoom mechanism broke 3x. The first time I had fixed at my cost. I was not sure that I had not caused the damage. One day after getting it back, the problem resurfaced and the repair people fixed it again. This was the second long repair time. About 2 months later I was at a music festival, went to turn it on and guess what? Yep, the zoom mechanism was broken again. I am not going to bother fixing it. After I get the pictures off it (the only way now is directly from the SD card), this camera is going to that great camera in the sky.Tony"
5,Best product compared to price,"This is my 5th Digital Camera, before I have Nikon 3100.1. LCD great2. Picture Great3. Battery Great4. Design & appearance Great5. Price is Bestwhat else you need ? Need a Brand Name like Canon,Nikon, Sony - Go ahead."
4,"Great styling, okay picture quality","The Exilim EX-Z40 is a small wonder to look at and hold ... and to actually use. It's arguably the best-looking digital camera on the market today. One look at it and you'll want to buy one. The matching cradle is also just as ""cute.""Picture-quality-wise, it's good, but not as good as Canon's offerings. There's a certain softness to the pictures it takes, and you cannot adjust the sharpness level like you can on many (admittedly larger) cameras. The 2"" LCD is just totally wonderful, but does put on some drain on the dimunitive battery.All in all, a pretty good package if a bit expensive. It's definitely something you can impress a lot of people with."
5,Nice little camera for a back up or just to keep in your pocket,"I bought this EX 40 Camera a few years ago and after taking about 1/2 million photos I dropped it in the ocean. I bought 5 cameras since then and now have a pile of what I call junk cameras. I saw this on Amazon and more then happy to buy it and start getting some great sunset photos again. I live on the beach on the Sea of Cortez in Mexico and am almost board with all the awesome sunset photos I can take here. This camera takes the best sunset photos and two of my photos from this camera have made the covers of magazines. check out my web site at www.go2rockypoint.com and see some photos. Having the video and sound record modes is a huge plus. I give this an ""A"""
5,A great camera for everyday use!,"I was a bit skeptical of the Casio brand but I liked all the features of this camera and read a positive up review in a photography magazine so I took the leap. I haven't regreted it a bit. This is a great ""casual"" camera with easy settings for picking just the shot you need.Mine has taken a lot of abuse and has never failed to perform. I highly recommend the leather belt pouch for protection during carry. The only problem I have is deciding whether to upgrade to the 6 or 7 megapixel Exilim!"
4,Great camera in a nice package,I bought this camera as a replacement for my Olympus Camedia 3040. I found I never wanted to lug that thing around and so I started looking for a compact camera with a quick shutter lag. This camera lives up that with a terrific LCD and incredible battery life.The downside with this camera is the speed of the flash recharge. That can be a drag from time to time but it's something I'm willing to live with given this lil' numbers' other terrific qualities.
3,"Compact, fast but poor picture quality","Pros: compact, great battery life, quick start-up, quick release, ease of use, solid built.Cons: With outdoor lighting pictures are fine but a bit noisy (electronic clouded picture), therefore not crisp, solids look cloudy. This noise is much more pronounced in indoor or low light pictures even when using the flash; enough to make me wish I hadn't bought this. My old 2meg Canon A20 and Nikon 2100 takes better, crisper pictures. This shows up in the LCD display and also on the computer monitor and printed pictures. I wanted a compact camera with a quick shutter release. This camera meets this but I am quite disappointed with the picture quality. The 4 megapixel doesn't help. This is my 3rd digital camera."
2,Design may fool,This camera is not what it seems to be. The pictures come out grainy every time. I had the ex s2 digital camera that only had 2.1 mega pixels and it took better pictures than this. I do not recommend because the pictures are not good at all. Horrible in fact
2,"Poor Quality, worst under low light","We bought this camera thinking we could take nice pictures in night events, sports, etc, because it has multiple ISO and shutter speed settings.But you can't control speed or exposure, and we can't have good night shots, unless it's just an scene.I'd rather buy a Canon or Sony the same price, not this fancy but useless Casio."
1,old camera; new software; not as good as my 3 yr old cannon,I was surprised that $400 and 3 years hasn't done anything new. I have a 3 year old Cannon S200 that is as good as this camera. I suspect that this camera is functionally equivalent to the old Ex-Z4U. That camera is at least a year old now and this one seems to be the same model with the movie feature enabled.There must be a better camera out there.
2,Small but not worthy,This was my first Digital camera. I must say its small and easy to carry around. But it delivered poor quality prints in the mail. Not very good resolution. I also did not like the set up of the zoom buttons and on and off. Also having to miss a shot to get to the shot setup first. Cant go fast from portrait to landscape. I brought mine back to store and now I am using another type. Will let you know on that one.
5,tip to make it faster,"I bough this camera about a month ago, and so far love it! I started carrying it around in my laptop bag when I go to work. You never know when you'll need it! My girlfriend is begining to make fun of me always having this camera around!Anyway, I took it on a recent trip, and managed to shoot 512MB card full of pictures. As other posts suggest, the battery did not even go from showing full charge. On the plane home, reviewing the pictures, I finally saw the battery meter drop one bar.Finally, here is a tip to make the camera a bit more responsive. Make sure that Album auto create is set to off. You can access it via this menu:Menu > Play > Create Album > Set Up > Auto > Off.If it is set to ""On"", the photo album is re-created after each shot, and as the number of pictures goes up, the time it takes to build an album increases. There is a noticeable delay before you can take another picture. I relized this at about 100 shots.Good luck, you'll love this camera."
3,Drug & Alcohol Review,I think the Drug and Alcohol question and answer guide has been a great study help in preparation for the exam.
1,dsst drug and alcohol abuse,"i cannot really rate this book, since i never received this book. however amazon refunded my money, i needed this book to take a test. oh well...."
4,great resource,"The book didn't cover everything on the test but it did enough to prepare me for the type and style of questions that were asked. The other recommended text, Drugs and Society, covered the rest of the material."
3,OK-but buy the book too!,"After getting a shock from studying the Civil War and Reconstruction guide, I bought both the study guide and the recommended reading (Drugs and Society) for this test, and passed with an A. Not an easy test, but made much better by reading the accompanying material."
4,Passed My Test,"Passed the test using only this text as study material. Scored a 59 and the passing score was 49. I did find a couple wrong answer in the book, but it still did a good job of preparing me for the test. Im 3 for 3 thus far using these books."
1,I passed!,"I took this test yesterday and I passed with a 57. I was very dissapointed with this study guide because I felt this guide was not helpful at all. Out of all the practice questions that was in this book, only a handful(5) were on the test. I'm glad that I didn't put that much effort in studying for this test because that would have been a waste of time. Two of my friends also took this test recently and used this guide and they felt that this book was not helpful at all. My personal opinion is that I don't think I would've passed if not for my medical background. I don't recommend this book at all."
5,W00T!!,"Still the best high school comedy/mech anime out there. This last volume of The Second Raid is definitely a fitting way to end this arc, but it also leaves the door open for more FMP. If you haven't seen the first Full Metal Panic things might be a little confusing, and I would definitely recommend watching it on Youtube or something, but they do a pretty good job with flashbacks and getting you up to speed on the older characters. If you have seen the whole series than you'll definitely enjoy volume 4 of TSR. So to all the die hard FMP fans: definitely pick up volume 4, and keep your fingers crossed that another series is released soon because a world without FMP is certainly no world at all."
5,Please dont let that be all she wrote!!,"I don't often write reviews or opinions, outside of myspace of course, but i just finished Tactical Ops 4 and i am left disappointed...THAT IT'S OVER!! This is my opinion, I have grown to love this series more than any other in my meager collection and i fell a great sense of lose at the fact that this is over. All of the characters is this entirely too short series are so well thought out that i believe that anyone would be hard pressed to find another anime with more character depth (again my biased opinion). Well....if i don't stop myself there i will spend too much time writing something that you will probably skim, so i will leave it at this: BUT THIS SERIES!!"
5,Find out what makes you tick.,"This is one of the most clearly written, easy-to-understand books on how to learn what makes us tick. It will help you to figure out who you are and what path to follow. It helps to understand the people around you as well. Easy to read, easy to follow. . . I highly recommend it to all those who would like to become all they can be."
2,Definatley not worth the price they are asking now,Ok I bought this book over a year ago from Swagrox I think I paid maybe like twenty bucks for it.. I have been a huge Nikki Sixx fan since Too Fast For Love came out.. and i had to buy it. Its NOT a very good book.. most the information in there is common knowledge and after reading The Dirt you know more about him than what you may learn from this book. The author did a HORRID job.. theres spelling errors and other huge mistakes in there.. I'm pretty sure a trained monkey could have done a better job. Even the font that they printed it in is lame... looks like some teenager with poor eyesight typed it.. in the dark with one arm?? I can't believe these people are asking that much for this book.. its NOT worth it..trust me
1,Waste.,"If you can actually make it all the way through this book, you may learn a few new things about Nikki Sixx. Well, I suppose that depends on how long you've been following his career. And whether you've read The Dirt, as this book draws heavily on that one.As has been said before, this book contains numerous errors, run-on sentences, repetitions, and misspellings. If you took out all the repeated phrases, this book would probably be half as long as it is. Okay, I may exaggerate, but not by much. It seems that Mr. Brown didn't even check to see if he had all of the names right. The most glaring example is Dave Mustaine being called Dave Mustang. Repeatedly.I'll be avoiding any further books by this author."
1,Ugh...,"Richard Kendrick and ""Randy"" must have read this book upside down or backwards, because it surely does not deserve four or five stars. In fact, it was so bad, I'm going to see if I can get a star BACK for having read this!"
5,Best Bed side Alarm Clock I ever had,"Agree with the previous review. Are area experiences frequent power outages. Though they're short most other electric devices with clocks have have to be reset, not the Westclox Reliance.Not the most luxurious, but being older I also like the large dial with back lighing which I can read without glasses.To bad they seem to be discontinued, I'd like to buy a replacement since after 7 years the backlighing has died in my second clock. Guess I'll have to investigate having the light bulb replaced."
1,Absolute garbage,"This is a poor excuse for a book. It is essentially poorly written, pretentious, pointless pornography couched in a World War II story. It is weak, repetitive, boring and, for those who know the term, ""drek"" it applies perfectly."
1,Really superficial and out-of-date,"Published in 1995 (!), the Dark Ages at Internet speeds. This books thinks MCIMall is hot news.I found myself irked by the authors repeatedly discussing the choice of how to put your home page on the Internet. They force a choice between dialing up and leasing a line. Of course, 90 percent of the people who want to put a home page on the Net just use someone else's server and share costs."
4,Would recommend to other Saab 16v drivers,"Much detailed information, usable for me, doing all the maintenance and (major) repairs myself.It's is a pity there is no rebuild information concerning the gearbox."
5,Quality step by step repairs,"This book is one of the best that we have dealt with. Normally we go with Haynes, but one was not available. Took a chance buying this one and it paid off. Detailed with step by step directions and photos. Highly recommend this book to anyone who needs it!"
5,Best repair manual there is,If you are serious about maintaining your car then the Bentley books are the best choice. This book has already helped me with some very in depth work on my SAAB 900S and I can trust the information as being accurate. If you have a Saab story needing work this is the book to start with!
4,good buy,The book is just what I wanted to fix my car. My top will not work and this book has the information i need.
4,Shortened version of complete manual.,"I've been using this manual for 7 years now.It has main issues found on 900s, but not everything.In fact is a shortened version of manufacturer's maintenance manual.Very good, but incomplete.Anyway, it is indispensable for Saab 900 classic model owners. I solved some annoying problems based on information found here."
5,It's already paid for itself in one repair,"My saab was running great - then not so much. The idle speed was running very high most of the time, around 2,000 rpm. When I touched the accelerator it dropped down to around 1,200 rpm, still about 300 rpm above normal. It also (just once) alarmingly lost then regained power, quickly, so I was kangaroo-ing down the road looking like a first-time driver not able to handle the clutch.Upon receiving the book I started to diagnose the problem. Within thirty minutes I was confident it was one of two things, both easy to check using the information in this book. It turned out not to be the air mass meter, but instead was the throttle position sensor. The car was fixed within an hour and is running (touch wood) wonderfully now. Using this book saved me money. A big thanks for Bentley publishers !"
4,An Essential Help,This is a great book for working on the 16 valve engine. It covers more of the nitty gritty stuff that you need when working on the more advanced Saab engine. The turbo section is great. The only complaint I have is that the book is not more specific about the differences in the engine configurations from one year to the next. But if you need wiring diagrams or schematics this is the book for you.
2,This is supposed to help?,"This book has very limited information. I bought it because I am taking several clep exams and thought this would be suffiecient. Wrong! The information covered in the book is not even the same as the exam. Don't waste your money on this book, especially if you're taking an exam in which you have little backround. The clep's are very difficult and require several resources to prepare."
1,Marginally Useful,"I'm sorry that I paid good money for this ""study guide"". The practice tests offer some insight into the test questions but that's about all this book is good for. One thing that really ticked me off about the tests are that you can't even find out if you would have passed the test! There is an answer key but the book explains that there is some secret formula for grading the actual test."
4,"It's not a study guide, but sample questions are important!",I passed 8 CLEP exams in the last few weeks and this is one of the key tools that I used. It is a very good idea to see sample questions from the folks who actually write the real exam so you know what to expect! But you have to understand that this book contains sample questions with answers and that is all. You need an actual study guide to learn the material first.
2,There are better resources out there,This book is not a good resource to prepare you for these exams. The included practice exams do not even have answers. I just finished my degree and have earned over 80 credits using exams. I recommend the getyourcollegedegree website ebook as it outlines everything you will need with several complete study guides.
5,"Study Guide, Must Have!","This study guide or rather a group of sample questions is extreamly helpful in preparing for ALL the CLEP tests. I have taken 7 so far and will be taking 3 more. I average around 64 on all of them so far. The questions are typical of what is on the tests. These are the same people that wrote the CLEP tests! Take the tests, do a little research, ie. Library or online to find the correct answers on the ones you don't know. The questions on the test sometimes are exactly the same as in the book. Most of the time they just asked the same question in a different way. Good Luck."
4,No study material included - more of a reference book,FYI - this book only has example test questions in it (along with the answers).You will need study materials for the base of your test prep and this book can just be used as a final check that you have a good grasp of the subject.It is a great reference for all the tests though. I have used it numerous times to look at what other tests are offered and what type of info those tests entail.
2,Much Ado about Nothing,"I was surprised, in a book about Vacuum, not to encounter any mention of its canonical forms (Casimir, Rindler, Inflationary, Cosmic String, and ""Groundhog Day""...but I may be leaving one out), as were detailed in J. Richard Gott's book, _Time Travel in Einstein's Universe_. One would think, with Nothing else to write about (pun intended), this book would go into greater depth on the subject of what is known about Vacuum and the distribution of energy density, for instance. The best I can say is that this book should be read as more of a history of the concept of nothingness, of which it presents a very good treatment."
1,Pool toy - not sports stuff,"This is not a sports kayak you could put in a river, not even a mild one. The plastic is flimsy and the kayak is soft and wobbly, even if overinflated. Nothing like the Tahiti, and the price difference is not worth the quality difference - get a Tahiti or similar, unless you're going to play in the pool..."
1,Absolute rubbish,"There exists an excellent about one hundred dollar inflatable kayak, Sevylor's K79 Tahiti, and then there exist various scary kayak-like objects that are too dangerously weak and uncontrollable to even count as a boat. The other reviewer is bang on, it's fine in a swimming pool as a float, but not acceptable even on a calm lake. Folks have paddled between the Hawaiian islands, and the whole length of the Amazon on the Sevylor Tahiti."
3,"Beautiful boots, but calf was too narrow for me","I am so sad that these don't fit me, because they are beautiful! IMO, $60 is a great price for knee-high leather boots, but I had to return them because the calf was too narrow for me (I need at least a 15.5"" circumference and the boots I received measured at 14.75""-15"")."
3,Narrow calf portion,"These (and most of this tall boots) are so narrow, you can hardly zip them up unless you have stick skinny legs. I am only a size 4 and I couldn't even zip them up half way."
2,not good boots,"They don't look like brand-name boots. Inside the calf, I only see ""made in china"" and size, no material description at all. On the box, there is a label which says ""lether"", but I don't know which part is made with leather. Insole has a thin layer of padding, but I can see the foam sticking out and dry glue in several places. The worst thing is one calf is 1 inch longer than the other, and it was too obvious to be ignored when I tried them on. I might want to keep them for $30, but for $60, I will have to return them to get better ones. The size does run larger. And be careful, they are very SLIPPERY! the leather around ankle is very stiff."
4,It's not the best but it IS good!!,I haveread this book 3 times and I still think it is a GOOD book. I do not know why you guys think it is a bad book. I liked it a lot. The romance was all right and so was the action!!
1,Bre's,"What's wrong with this book? Everything! Well, almost everything anyway. Die-hard Star Wars fans will probably read it anyway, despite what myself and other reviewers are saying. Firstly, I spent nearly two-thirds of the book trying to figure out whether it had a plot or not. As it turns out, it doesn't. The original Star Wars characters are fairly well done, but the other characters fall completely flat. And Callista . . . well she's nice and all that, but she doesn't seem quite the right chick for Luke. Mara is much better. (Sorry to all the people who have been living in caves and haven't found that out yet.) I personally find Ms. Hambly's writing syle very difficult to get involved in. I felt it distanced me from what was going on in the book. And, lastly, this book had none of the magic which is Star Wars. A great disappointment."
1,So bad I read it again to make sure a year later.,"This book and Planet of Twilight are boring. I hate it when our heros wander aimlessly, a problem in a few SW books. At least I didn't buy the book on tape before reading it, like I did with planet of twilight. Anyone want to buy the tape, cheap? JEDIMACK."
1,This book's only redeeming function is as a paperweight,"This book was awful. A-W-F-U-L! I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I have enjoyed many of the recent novels that continue the storyline, but this book is completely wretched. The ""plot"" is misguided and uninteresting, the characters are made into bland, emotionless automatons...I cannot stress enough how boring this book was. I still cannot believe I had the strength to finish it. Finishing this book might be the bravest thing I've ever done..."
1,....boring...zzzz,"After a few chapters, I had to put down the book.Yeah Luke meets Callista here and falls in lovebut in another book, she is taken away from him for good.At least he married Mara.Anyway, as far as this book-don't waste your time or money."
3,Average at best.,This book really wasn't that great. I found myself skimming at times then asking how a character got where they were and not really caring. Part of the problem was that I had read a number of books that take place after this and knew generally what would happen. Even not knowing that it wasn't that great of a read. I would avoid this book unless you want to read all the EU books.
3,Refreshing or destroying?,"This book is for some a refreshing break from the rigidness of the many other Star Wars books. However, for many this book is lacking in a variety of emotions and is a cumbersome read"
1,Disappointing......,First let me say I read purely for entertainment. I don't read books to critique them. With that said i had a really hard time reading this book. The Luke Skywalker parts are just ok. The Han and Leia parts are soooooo boring i only made it to page 158. I thought about just skipping Han and Leia and reading the Luke parts but decided against it. I wouldn't pay attention to any of the 5 star reviews about this book. You can trust the ones that are 2 or 1 stars. I will say that this is the first time I've had this problem with any star wars book and i've read the entire New Jedi Order and X-wing Series. Save your money and put it in your gas tank if you drive.
1,This book was the worse book I ever read,"Barbara hambly...dragged out parts so bad, it was so boring. If the store were giving them away for free I would take all of them and burn them so all of you star wars fans won't have to waste your time and money. May the FORCE be with you."
2,Not Worthy of 'Star Wars',"How the publishers let this lemon slip by their quality control process I don't know, but this book is not worth the cost of the paper it was printed on. The plot is twisted, the characters out of character, and the book is ultimately boring."
1,Blah!! Run...run as fast as you can....away from this book!,"I must say Children of the Jedi was definitely one of the worst books I ever read. The whole book is one giant confusing mess, with poorly developed characters and a really sad plot (sad as in pathetic!). Hambly should take somw advice from Zahn, Anderson, and Crispin. WHY? Because they can WRITE! The other really bad book was Planet of Twilight...written by Hambly also. Am I seeing a pattern here? Where is the zero star rating when you need it?"
2,WHAT???????????????????????????????????,"The general idea was good, but the way it was written was horrible!!! I couldn't understand anything (execpt the words I reckonized.)Where do the Children of the Jedi come in????????? A major dissapointment"
1,Boring!!! Pointless!!! Puts me to sleep everytime I try to,"read it. It's been almost 3 years and I still can't finish this piece of blasphemy. How can anyone call this ... this... this book a Star Wars Novel. Where is Timothy Zahn when you need him. I decided to finally give up on this piece of unreadable nonsense and read Darksaber (which was pretty bad too, I might add). At least I didn't have to waste my time trying to figure out what happened at the end. Not that it mattered anyway. The only reason why I bought this book was because of the dazzling cover by artist Drew Strutsan. (I shouldn't have judged this book by its cover) A note to Barbara Hambly: Please do not write anymore Star Wars books. It is very painful to see the once-great SW books fall into a mediocre Star-Trek-like book series. Don't mess with the Star Wars characters. Write about Spock and Co. if you will, but not about Luke, Han. Leia, Chewie, not even the Jawas. Thanks."
1,How Does Lucas Allow This?,"Only reason its not a 1? Its still a visit to the Star Wars Universe. Nonetheless, this is a pointless, boring, and torturous book. I dont know how Hambly got away with writing a Star Wars book without a major space battle in it. Along with the Force, the fantastic military machines are what make Star Wars special."
1,Children of the Jedi,"If you know anything about Star Wars at all(the author does not)you will hate this book. The author(who has no place writing a Star Wars novel)fild a choppy feeble story line with tons of bad description ""gluey wind"" and lame dialogue. The Author has no sense of who the characters are so you end up with old characters doing and saying things that they wouldn't do(Luke Skywalker is a feeble minded wimp). The story just plain sucks. If you have a collection of Star Wars books and need this one for that buy it otherwise its a waste of money. I was so maddend by the authors hack job that I destroyed the book."
1,Book? What book?,"Now, don't get me wrong... I love Star Wars books, but this one was ridiculous. Here's what I don't like... Callista had her chance to live, she lived. Yeah she was brave giving her life to save hundreds of others, she's DEAD, the end! OK, she needs to pass on to the Force, where she belongs. You have one life to live, you live it and you die 2. I did not like the way Ms. Hambly viewed Mara Jade, as having a relationship with Lando. Those two just don't mesh. 3.Irek and Roganda Ismaren didn't even scare me. I never thought 'What if Leia doesn't make it?' 'What if they...'NO SUSPENSE!"
1,Worst Star Wars author,"I love the star wars expanded universe. I have read over 100 of the novels, and Children of the Jedi and Planet of Twilight are my least favorite by far. I usually fly through a star wars novel, but I kept putting this one down, having a very hard time getting through it. The writing style is choppy, and parts that should be full of emotion and excitement feel dry and boring. I didn't realize Planet of Twilight was another Hambly book until I started reading it, and then the style was unmistakable. If you are looking for a good Star Wars book, this isn't it."
4,"This is a great book, for adults, no sci-fi book nerds","This was an awesome book, the ending is worth it, besides everyone knows that some other author will off CAL. at some point, She is not even listed in future books, So give the author a break the ending is totally unpredictable.. as long as you don't think about it and just read it, BUT the plot is very confusting at times but much better than Anderson's next book in the line, come on how many times will the empire screw up and not kill some Rebels. Read this book but don't read the next book in the series ,, IT sucks, I for one want to see Luke hook up with some body for a change.........if so recommend a book"
5,Action and good literature actually in one novel!!,"I've already enjoyed many ""Star Wars"" novels, but this one is by far the best example of good writing. Although both Anderson and Wolverton have terrific plots, their language usage cannot compare with that of Hambly. Her color and images bounce from the pages to your mind. The story itself is commendable, and enjoyable. It's Star Wars with the polish of Dickens."
1,YUCK!,This book is th emost boring star wars book I have ever TRIED to read! I found that the only good part of it was the leia part. I would cringe when I would turn to the next chapter and see that it was luke... I started the book in august...97.. and I still havent finnished it... and it's july 5th! 98! Usually I finnish books in one week....
2,"""Children"" not a book for children","""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" would correctly sum up Hambly's book ""Children of the Jedi"", as the book seems to stray 'far, far away' from the rest of the Star Wars saga. With a confusing plot and some relativly weak characters, Hambly -unfortunately- successfully manages to turn a star wars space opera, into a soap opera. But I'm not here to thrash and trash this book like so many of the others, because unlike them, I actually understood and enjoyed it. I still cannot recommend this book to anybody though other than hard-core star wars fanatics who MUST read every book that's been published. If you're someone just looking for another series to start on, Then you might want to consider skipping this one for now."
1,STOP!,Oh man I can't even finish the book its waaaaay to boring. The most bad part is I read it a few days after I finished the Thrawn Trilogy. It was like I ate a yummy good candy (Thrawn's Trilogy) and then drank down some nasty stuff(Children of the Jedi). I reccomend not wasting your time on it!
1,out of one mess and into another,"I thought I'd enjoy Hambly but her style was to slick for me. She jumped around way to much leaving me totally confused and in the dark(just like the ship luke was stuck on). I could of swore my bookwas missing a chapter, how the heck did Luke realize he loved Callista? My best guesse is his horphmones kicked in late or somethin. After i finished that I read Darksaber wich seemed like the light at the end of the tunnel even though he' really not that impressive (after Hamblys book anything would seem as refeshing as Zahn). Then because I've dedicated myself to reading ever novel and in order i might add, I forced myself to choke down her second book (or try anyway). I was hoping she would improve but shes only gotten worse. I gave this a 2 only because I'd give Twilight a 1."
2,Ouch,"Well, here we go. Luke keeps passing out all the time, the plot is boring, Mara and Lando together are disgusting, Luke and Callista's love story is impossible to stand, that story about the Emperor having another Hand was also hard to take. So, the reason I didn't give this book a 1 is because of the part where they talk about the Jedis and all that stuff, I liked that. But still, the book is bad and boring."
1,Awful. A read like being stepped on by an AT-AT.,"This is a book that makes you wonder why some writers even get paid. Lousy story full of contradictions, and I agree heartily with those reviewers who wondered how a few scratches can impair a Jedi Master. It's too bad someone didn't find the manuscript of this one and turn it to ash with a lightsaber before it hit the press!"
2,Ugh!,"Ugh! I could not belive how gross this was! Like Callista herself, the Eye of Palpatine, and most of all a crazed hermit shrieking ""Solo! Die!"" The reason I don't give it a 1 was because I enjoyed visiting with Jawas, Tuskens and Gammoreans from the movies."
2,It was okay.....,"this book was ok. i have read better books. in the beginning, i had to literally FORCE myself to read it. i meam, i was soooo excited to be reading a SW book and in the beginning it was sooo boring. it was also hard to follow and confusing. the middle and end were pretty good. the book got better as you read it. the end plot had a good twist. once you got to the end the plot kept twisting and i was very surprised. i liked Callista a lot though. i really liked the fact that the all powerful Luke could fall in love. it was sweet. this book was ok but i dont recommend it to people who are looking for a really good book to curl up with."
2,I've read better Star Wars novels,"Usually with a Star Wars novel, I can hardly put it down. This one was a struggle to pick up. The first 150 pages were confusing beyond belief.( How did Luke end up on the ship and what was Han and Leia even looking for?) If you can get past the first 150 pages, it does get better. It wasn't a very good love story either. Luke and Callista's pairing was more like two lustful teenagers who couldn't control their hormones than a love story. It's a confusing read for this simple mind."
2,Not The Best SW book for sure,"Callista should just go back to the past. Some of it was realy confusing, but it was ok. Since when did jawas speak english????? Luke needs to marry Mara, or just forget the female race. If you want to read books not so boring and draged out that are shorter, but great read all of the Young Jedi Knight series by Kevin J. Anderson and Rebcca Moseta."
2,Unbelievable even for Sci-Fi standards,"The only thing I kept saying to myself as I read this book was, ""What the heck was the motivation for that action?"" First of all, why in the world is the head of state completely ignoring her responsibilities as leader of the free universe to go wandering around in tunnels like an adventurous teenage kid?--the whole Leia as head-of-state thing was just a bad turn in the first place, but that's another story. Either way, the hunch of a hunch of a hunch storyline of this book makes it so incredibly implausible that I was actually mad at myself for taking the time to read it."
1,"Slow, confusing, poor character development","I didn't think it was possible to make me hate any star wars character, especially Luke(my fav)--but this novel proved me wrong. I literally dragged myself through it. It was boring, and the characters lacked any of the humor and charisma that made us love them in the first place. For shame Ms. Hambly!"
1,"Boring, predictable, lame...",I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... this one was pretty bad...
4,Good but bad at the same time.,The beginning weas good the end was bad that all i can say and also after hearing how badly lukes leg hurt for the millionth time it got old. Probally twenty times in two pages. And the ending was somewhat confusing. But I liiked the whole gamorrean tribe thing.
3,Ehhh... it was ok.,"This book was ok, I guess. It should be titled ""Eye of Palpatine"" because the children of the Jedi didn't have THAT much to do with the plot. The characters, that's another story. Luke isn't someone to fall in love with a person like Callista, of anybody. PERIOD! Leia kept mentioning all of these aunts. Where did THEY come from? She seemed kind of, well, like a Jedi. In the Jedi Academy Trilogy, she couldn't. C-3P0 wasn't himself (prissy)."
1,Boring!,"All you hardcore SW fans will probably read this book anyway ( I did), but I want you to know, that this book, and Hambly's other, are so boring that you will regret ever reading any star wars books at all. Although the book between them by Kevin J. Anderson is a fun one, the whole three book story is one that is long, stretched out, boring, and has absolutely no effect in any following novels. I'm not saying you shouldn't read these 3 books (because Darksaber is great and needs this book to be understood), but I'm just saying that this one will be horrible, and Planet of Twilight will ( ) even more."
1,This book is just ridiculous,"Ok, I love Star Wars. But this book is awful. It is long, boring, and confusing as well. I wish I could have given it no stars. Callista is such a ridiculous character. She's a computer for God's sake. I could take that if she had ANY chemistry with Luke. Frankly, I think he was bored with the plot line just like me, and she was just there. I guess you could read this book if you wanted to laugh. The vegetable people(literally, think cucumber people) are pretty funny. Wow. The stupidity abounds. You know the book is bad when you wish a universe shattering explosion would eliminate all traces of the novel. Eeewww."
1,I'm glad I borrowed this book...,"...instead of buying it. Mission Impossible was easier to follow. I liked the way it started out, but then it just turned into this confusing mess. I think this book actually lowered my IQ. Barbara Hambly almost made me hate this entire book series, and I can't believe they let her write another one! By the way, I think I can do without reading Planet of Twilight and keep what's left of my sanity. If you'll excuse me, I need to read some Timothy Zahn now."
2,How do you mean 'this is Star Wars'?,"Well, to use an understatement, i've seen better. The story contains some interresting parts and ideas, but unfortunatly, none of those ideas are used to their full potential. Next to that,the people in this novel do not appear to have anything to do with star wars, exept for their names, the only ones that behaved a bit like themselfes were Mara and C-3PO. As a whole, the novel wasn't that horrible, but it is most certainly one of the lesser of the star Wars novels."
2,What has happened to the Star Wars Galaxy?,"OK ladies and gentlemen, where should I start? Here we go. I thought this book would be soooooo much better than it was. Lame and confusing are the best words that I can find to describe it. I absolutely love the books, but I had to pray I didn't fall asleep halfway through the book because of the boring plot and slow developements. And what the hell is with the Eye of Palpatine? It's a DREADNAUGHT!!!! Not a super star destroyer. How can it be so devestating? And whatever happened with the children? Does anyone know? So many things could have been made better, but they just plain weren't!!! All in all, this is probably the most boring book I've read in Star Wars, and I'm up to Vision of the Future."
3,Better than Some,"Hmm...it seems that the ones I think are passable are the ones that everyone else seems to hate. Maybe I'm too much of a Star Wars nut, but at least this one has a plot, decent characterizations of the original heroes, and a plot that at least is more plausible than others. Unfortunately, they once tie Lukes hands when it comes to the force, and their excuse is lame, and there isn't enough space action, but hey, thats me."
1,Words cannot describe...,"This is by far the WORST book I have ever read. I tried so hard to get through it but it was impossible! Once those retarded plant people (what was up with that?) showed up I couldn't take it. I didn't think it was possible to make me annoyed with Star Wars, but Barbara Hambly did it. She should do Star Wars fans everywhere a favor and STAY AWAY FROM STAR WARS!!! YOU'RE KILLING IT, FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!"
1,STUPID book!!!,"This book was SOOOO boring! There was too much description of everything. Some ""sentences"" were half a page long!COTJ just isn't Star Wars quality. There are much better books out by Kevin J. Anderson and A.C. Crispin!! I would recommend them instead."
1,This is a good book,This is a good book for the brain-dead. The characters are extremely boring. I hate Luke's insessent whining about his leg and the storyline really sucks. The author doesn't know how to write good Star Wars novels.
1,Yawn,I could not wait for this book to end. Oh well . . . at least it was better than the Crystal Star. Hmmmm . . . come to think of it - that's not saying very much!
1,children of blah blah,"I started reading this book and put it down about half-way because it had nothing I could get interested in and the writing wasn't good. Also, the premise of a Jedi outside of Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin retaining her identity after the death of her physical body is contrary to the newer G-canon from the prequel movies. So this is yet another novel that is rendered impossible by Lucas' superior offical continuity. I guarrantee I will never finish this book now.Instead of this book, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels that are extremely relevant to the film series:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"
1,The Worst Star Wars Book I Have Ever Read,This Book Sucks Is Looooooooong And Drawn Out and most of all boring But to keep the continuity of the series you have to read it sorry
1,When did Star Wars become melodrama?,"This was a poorly written novel to say the least. I understand that a sci-fi writer is allowed some dramatic license when s/he pens a novel, but, c'mon. The least s/he can do is stay true to the title ""star Wars"". I can follow a tangent as well as the next person but enough is enough. She jumps topics and does not 'bridge the gaps' between what was and what is."
2,This book was soooo boring.,"I bought this book, thinking it would be good. It sounded good. I was WRONG! This book was incredibly boring! One or two things were okay, but I think overall, this book is thumbs down."
1,HUH?,"This book was the worst Star Wars book by far. I did not understand the plot and I my mind kept wandering while I was reading, it was that boring. And where did Callista come in? Luke couldn't talk to her one chapter and she suddenly had a voice? The whole thing was just unrealistic. Even if she was a Jedi. How can you be trapped in a computer for so long and not have made your presence known? And why was Luke the only one to snap out of the brain-washing thing? And there was another Emperor's Hand? I would think that Mara would have had SOME clue about that, she can't be that brain dead. The book sucked, big time. Don't bother reading it, it's a total waste of your time."
2,To say it lightly this book sucked!,"I read this book because I thought it would be fun to read because Luke falls in love finally!I mean I love HaN SOLO like all but I kinda felt bad for Luke.Any ways THIS BOOK STUNK!First of all being only 14 this book seemed to grown up.Well to Grown up for Star Wars.It was grown up because number one the plot was confusing(and boring)and because it was all lovey dovey if you know what I mean.(I really dont feel like saying it on-line-)but I dont want to trash this book any more because even though I disliked it a lot,I enjoy the character of Callista and it was nice to know there was somebody out there who fixed Luke up with a nice girl!"
1,One Word: BAD,"This is probably the most confusing, most boring, and pathetic Star Wars books ever written. Hambly forgot one element in this book: a plot. I can find more excitiment in reading a disclaimer. This book was so confusing after I read it I had to get the cassete from the library to understand and I still couldn't get the plot. Not worth spending money on. Plus Callista is a very useless character."
1,Unfocused writing mixed with boring plot,"I found ""Crime and Punishment"" and ""War and Peace"" a faster read than this book. I consider myself a avid fan of the Star Wars Universe (reading the novels, playing the game and the like). When reading this book, however, I found myself hoping Luke and Leia would die just so the book would end. The usually witty dialogue of the main characters was replaced in this book with looooong thought bubbles that were not in character. Any action in the book was slowed down by irrelevant factoids making one believe that the author had to do this to expand her short-story-idea into a novel. Those that approve all work to go into the StarWars Universe really fell down on the job with this book."
2,Not Too Swift,"I have read a lot of Star Wars books, and I like almost all of them -- even the mediocre ones. This one is SO terrible that I just forced myself, after reading about half of the book, to skim the rest so that I had the plot down. That way if it is referred to in other Star Wars books, I would know what the author was talking about. Basically, Luke gets trapped on an automated ship that's on a destructive mission for the now-dead Empire, and he can't escape (he's too injured). The entire time, he's in excruciating pain and wandering around this ship. Leia and Han are on a distant planet, looking for clues about some supposedly mythical descendants of Old Republic Jedi. It just goes on and on, and then on and on some more. I really DO NOT recommend this book. If you're interested in Star Wars, PLEASE start reading the X-wing series instead of this :)"
1,I've read *A LOT* better!,"Ugh. This was a horrible book. The reasons why are stated over and over below me: no plot, bad characterizations, ect. I think the story had potential and could have been entertaining ... maybe if another author had written it. I read it once; and forced myself to read it again - in the hope I'd understand it better, but halfway through I just decided to drop the attempt. Unless you're really a hardcore, gotta-read-everything SW fan, stay away. Otherwise, steal or borrow. This thing is not worth the cash you'd pay for it."
1,I'll make this review simple,"The writing style is too choppy to be considered a decent narrative. The plot is very weak. The characters are flat, especially Luke's love interest (who isn't even human). It is almost painful to read. The story even contradicts many beliefs of the Star Wars universe. I wouldn't even consider this a Star Wars novel hadn't the major Star Wars players been involved. I do not recommend this book."
1,A review on the first 62 pages,"I have now done something I have not done before. I have put down a Star Wars novel and will not pick it back up to finish it! This story is HORRIBLE. Just when you think something is going to happen, the brakes screech to a grinding halt, and you're forced to read through pages of verbiage that makes William F. Buckley Jr sound concise!There was one pleasing thing to this novel, and that is that I checked it out at the library. I didn't have to waste a single penny!"
1,WHY? WHY? WHY?,"I had a very hard time understanding this book. Hambly spent too much time describing and detailing the surroundings. I found myself falling asleep (literally) while reading many of the chapters. The book could easily be 100-150 pages shorter and still tell the whole story. It's a shame that this book can be considered essential to help understand books that take place after the events on Belsavis. The only reason I read it was for this reason. I'm surprised that with the style of writing that Hambly uses, she is considered to be a great science fiction novelist. It bores me out of my mind! Maybe the rest of the Star Wars universe should be written by authors like Timothy Zahn, who honestly has not written a Star Wars book which hasn't been great!"
2,Writing style and overall story was sub par,"As a Star Wars fan, this book was a major letdown. The author had a somewhat decent premise, but writing style and the bogging down of describing over and over the different species made this a disappointing read.Spoiler Alert:Pros of the book: The Emperor has a child? Different twist here. Emperor apparently had concubines, and one produced a child. Maybe a stretch for SW, but different. And the kid has the power over droids, and ships, but is he really using the Force or having help from something else.Cons: Luke is stuck on a ship with C-3PO most of the book and this is where it gets bogged down. He has help from a spirit of a Jedi named Callista, and is also accompanied by Nichos and Cray. Luke seems pretty weak in this role.Only purchase this book if you are a collector of SW books like myself."
3,It's O-kake,I like the frosting but it just tastes like someone not mixing peanut butter and chocolate that well. I would prefer just separate peanut butter or Reese's peanut buttter cups and chocolate on a cake.
2,Ouch!,"Yes, they work holding in nipples - but peeling them off hurt! Maybe if you used them for an hour, they'd peel off gently, but wear them for the day and OUCH! This ""beauty"" isn't worth the painly removal."
1,Not needed,"Level One is not necessary to learn Latin. Level One is all pronunciation. Latin is not spoken, therefore pronunciation is irrelevant. Save your money and start with Level Three."
4,Very Informing,"This book is about villages in Alaska and people giving their opinion of ANCSA.Me living in one of the villages he talks about, it's very interesting to learn about what people from 1000 miles away from me think about it.It's not the most exciting thing ever but it's pretty good."
2,Leave this one on the shelf,"Feel good, clean movies are great, and I appreciate the people who produce them. That said, that does not mean I want to watch a movie with a lame script, predictable action, and cue card emotions and dialogue. It is certainly obvious what is going to happen in this movie just from reading the back. I don't have a problem with settling in, watching a romance where I know exactly who's going to fall in love and anticipating it happening. But this movie was just a muddle of ridiculous situations and flat characters and I do not recommend!"
5,Pleasing...,"I had copied this movie years ago and had been waiting for someone to finally put it out on DVD. I don't know what it is about this movie, but it is fun and endearing to watch. Rhu spices it up just right and I found myself waiting to see what her character did next. The love story, reunion conflicts and jealousies were predictable, but fun. It reminded me of small towns all over the USA. It has love, hate, tears and a life-saving story which will please many viewers."
3,Nice but predictible,We have seen this story line many times. Girl goes home to visit after making it big in a big city and decides to move back home. Lisa Hartman is certainly worth watching. She falls in love (again) with her high school sweetheart and decides to not return to the big city. This movie is very predictable but enjoyable.
4,A good chic flick,My kind of picture. I like chic flicks that end happy and have good a good story lines with positive role models.
3,Indiana native Charles Deam,"I have the 1940 dated book, which no pictures. I have heard of a version with pictures, which would really help. The book is so very complete. I would recommend the book for the advanced as well as the beginner. The details are very easy to understand and apply. But, once again pictures would have been great. I have many of Mr Deam's other books and this one complements them wonderfully. Hard to find, bat a treasure once you do. Recommend this title by Charles Deam"
4,Great CD single for Finn Brothers fans,"Featuring the single ""Won't Give In"" from the latest Finn Brothers' CD ""Everyone is Here"", this CD-single has two additional strong tracks that make this worthwhile for fans to pick up. It's a pity that both ""Way Back Down"" and ""Sunset Swim"" weren't offered as part of a limited edition bonus CD set. Either way, this is well worth picking up particularly for the beautifully written ""Sunset Swim"".While you're at it, pick up the CD as well. Let's demonstrate that these corporate radio programmers don't know what they're doing by excluding this fine album from airplay."
4,BRUTAL!,Great video quality and some actual acting talent. Much better than a lot of horror movies I've seen. I recommend it to anyone who likes brutal revenge flicks. No for the squeamish.
4,"Wrong House, Right Buy!",I was surprised with this movie. the acting was actually pretty good and the two villains / victims were believable. Opening was a little slow but I understand why. Also there was a death scene that was very questionable and had me actually laugh out loud during the movie. I do recommend to go ahead and see this. I do believe the Director of this movie put his full effort into making this movie. I give him a lot of credit.
4,Too weight,"I like the combination of color but the iron bracelet make the watch too heavy, I don't how to use the cronograph, it doesn't come with manual."
4,Not bad at all,"Purchased one of these for a client's network that we've been swapping from 10/100Mbps CAT5e to 1000Mbps CAT6.Opened the box, and everything looked ok. No broken parts, no loose parts, looked like it was ready to go.Terminated a dozen or so runs to it, and all passed certification. So, I was impressed.I like the fact that it has wire guides that hook onto the back to group the twisted pair wires for each set of 6 jacks. I do wish that it had caps to go over the termination blocks once the wires are pushed down, but not a major grip as it's a stationary item once it's mounted to the rack and the wires are routed and secured down the wall.It's unshielded, so obviously you run the risk of interference and cross-talk, but again, each terminated run passed certification, and network is now running at 1000Mbps, so no complaints.I'd recommend it..."
1,False advertising?,Buyer beware. The item that was shipped to me was a generic patch panel. It was NOT a Trendnet patch panel.
4,When your home network grows too big,"When my home network got too big, I decided to wall mount a Cat6 patch panel and 1gb router (see my other reviews).This Cat6 patch panel replaces the (then) good-enough set of Cat6 jacks I fitted in a 4 x 3 port faceplate on a 2-gang wall mounted box. Now, not only do I have a neater network area, I can also reuse the Cat6 jacks that were formerly mounted in the box.After punching down 8 of the 24 ports and routing the cables through the cable holder as shown in diagram 5 (I will upload photo), I've discovered that it's very cramped near the hinged side of my 4U wall mounted bracket. If I have to punch down more connections, I'll probably need a different cable layout strategy."
4,Breeze of Innocence,"Currently busy for a short course but the moment I logged, I couldn't resist to give a 4 Star to 'Luka' - Suzanne Vega for that's how I know her! My name is Luka, I live on the second floor...words flow innocence through the air as she sings along.The child abuse theme and it's a sure message flow too. This ever been my fav number. Marlene on the wall is a good vocal delivery too and 99.9 degrees is another chart not to miss out. The samba music in the following numbers of the charts is pure music that reminds of samba picks. A smooth collection - smooth I say coz its innocence vibrating voice that fills mind with Suzanne Vega's lovely voice lingering for long time. A good Pick."
3,PBS Home video,"This was just chalked full of facts and photos. The kids thought it was pretty boring, but I learned a ton! I don't know if I would recommend it for young children, but for older kids with longer attention spans I think it was fabulous!"
3,Not light reading,it is a serious book and not for light reading. It goes into more depth about the math behind it than I was willing to get into at this time.
4,imaginary reality,"The book fascinated me. It brought to life what I'd anticipated as dry, boring dates and theorems. I don't follow all the calculations in the book, yet. But it has stretched my brain with the reading."
1,Defective Copy,"Many unprinted pages (114, 115, 118, 119,122, 123,126,127,130,131, 134,135, 138, 139, 142, 143) that neither Princeton Paperbacks (not sold directly by them) or Amazon (more that 30 days) would stand behind.This is a book that gave me additional prspestives to i."
3,somewhat dense and no problems to solve by the reader,"This book is well written, but, it does feel like the venerable professor took his lecture notes and strung them together, but dear me, he left out problems for the reader; this to me is a cardinal sin when it comes to expository math.Maybe the professor could create a website with problems + solutions related to the subject matter - give us puzzle people a chance at solving at least a few problems on our own."
4,"informative, challenging, high-calibre, poorly proofed","While I agree with most of Nahin's reviewers about the quality of his mathematics and how raptly we are kept attuned to his story, I could not read a page without the sneaking feeling that another typo -- or worse yet by far -- a serious mathematical error (such as squaring SQRT(-15) and getting 15!) would appear and stop me dead in my tracks. From a prestige imprint such as Princeton's, this lack of vigilance on the part of its editorial staff is inexcusable. Otherwise, a fine work, to be sure, and a math excursion to the middle reaches of the sport that is sorely needed in our math-less popular culture."
1,"Excellent book, extremely poor rendition on Kindle","I read this book with great interest and I would easily give it 4 stars for content.Unfortunately - it does NOT look good on Kindle at all (unless you are reading it on your desktop computer application). Kindle is unable to render the mathematical equations. They come out as low-quality, sometimes unreadable JPG-type files, or, if there is mathematical notation within the flowing text, it is basically garbled (square roots rendered as capital V, powers rendered as links to footnotes etc.). It takes away the joy of reading the book, not too mention that it makes it really hard to follow when you are trying to constantly IMAGINE how something looked in the original print version.This makes me very nervous about buying ANY book with mathematical content on Kindle."
1,Math textbook,"As an avid reader of non-fiction with a math/science bent I was sorely disappointed in what could have been an excellent book on a poorly understood topic. Instead, Nahin offers a math textbook with intermitten prose thrown in for context.The introduction to this book warns that a first-year college-level understanding of calculus is all that is required to follow the story of i. However, even armed with such an education, the calculations and examples proceed with a speed and sophistication that leaves anyone without a PhD baffled and bored."
2,Hope mistakes and style can be corrected in future edition.,"Compared with the story of e another similar textbook about the constants, this book lack the chronological and less historical fact. Rather it provide more mathemaitcs but unfortunately, not too detailed for a mathematician and too hard for a layman. ..."
3,For the mathematically-inclined (only)...,"Paul Nahin's book supposedly covers the history of i. The problem with this book is that it jumps around too much, which made it difficult (for me) to follow the main points. (There are too many asides and digressions- Nahin's enthusiasm apparently takes control of his editorial sense.)Finally, this book definitely requires more than a high school background, if you're average in math (like me). This book has some history, but it's spread out over WAY TOO many equations.(Obviously, Nahin doesn't realize that much of what he writes goes ""over the heads"" of ""non-math-inclined"" folks.) I wish we all had that problem :-)"
3,A Little Tough,The author does a great job explaining what the square root of -1 is used and how it is used. I was looking for a little more casual book. This book does get into some relativity complex math. Be prepared to work if you want to read it.
5,Awesome Season,"this is a great season. i loved how they had the cryptkeeper, the vaultkeeper and the old witch feud between each other to tell a story. this is a great season. the best episodes of this season are1. Game Over2. The Spider And The Flies4. The Avenging Phantom6. The Weeping Woman7. All The Gory Details8. Dead Men Don't Jump9. The Haunted Mine10. Growing Pains11. The Brothers Gruff13. Hunted14. Chuck (And Melvin) And The Beanstalker15. Transylvania Twistif you have not seen this season then i recommend you do"
5,Better than God Made Me!,This was very entertaining and more of an attention getter than God Made Me for my boy. He loves the puppet shows and I am impressed with the creativity in bringing the story of Noah's Ark to life for my child. Great colors!!
2,mediocre video,"I think this video is a bit of a knock off of Baby Einstein, but it lacks the vibrant, fast-paced and beautiful images. Actually, I dont find this video developmental in any way...the just show random images on the screen, many of which do not relate to Noah's Ark. My child was not at all interested in this. I recommend either Baby Einstein (if you want a simple, entertaining video) or Baby Miracle (if you want to introduce Bible stories to your baby in an educational way)."
5,Bettter than Baby Einstien,I bought this at a local Christian Book Store by chance for my 9 month old. He really enjoys the God Made Animals DVD. He likes the silly puppet skits and music. He always jumps when the big peanut drops on the elephant. The quality seems a lot better than some of the Baby Einstein videos I have watched with him. There is also a lot less of the toy playing shots and I am not nearly as bored being in the same room as it is playing. GO BUY IT NOW!
2,Disappointed by Quality and Images,"I purchased video for my 14 month old and was really disappointed by this video. First, it claimed to tell the story of Noah's Ark but it was just a bunch of random images loosely tied with a few quotes about Noah. My daughter watched the video half-way though (which is not so bad) but in general, prefers Baby Noah by Baby Einstein and Noah's Ark by Baby Miracle. While the video has a few pretty images, I do not recommend it. Hope my review is helpful."
4,Great interactive book for kids,This book is a fun book that the kids love! It is interactive and colorful. I would definitely recommend it!
5,Love these pans!,The pizza pan is very generous in size and the cookie sheet is perfect for those large batches of Christmas cookies!
5,It's not why they leave...It's how you keep them,"This is one of the finest books in a long time about not just keeping employees, but about why they work at all. It says much about what organizations and individual managers must do to create and keep a good working relationship. It is fundamentally a book on good leadership as recognized and voted upon by employees. The ultimate feedback on a leaders poor performance is when employees leave!Leigh provides a well-written book that contains a great deal of statistical support, but you are never overwhelmed by numbers. This book belongs on every managers desk and in the hand of every board of director or owner. There are no shortcuts to keeping good employees. It provides a convincing argument as to why good exit surveys are vital to a companies success.A job well done!"
5,A good read for all levels of the organization,I am in the sales department of a top pharmaceutical company. Retention of top performers is a real concern in our industry. This book offers practical steps you can take immediately to improve retention. It not only shows what you need to do to be an employer of choice but also reinforced for us what we were already doing right. A must for all managers who care about the bottom line and know that taking care of your high performers is the way to see the best profits.
5,"Excellent, practical book about how to have happy employees!",This book is outstanding. I stumbled across it while preparing for my move to China a few months ago knowing that people retention in CHina would be critical to success due to an abundance of opportunities for employees to change jobs. I've now had 2 months practice and his ideas really work!
5,Buying 2 more......,"I bought 2 of these as backups when I first bought my camera, 3 years ago. Now the original Panasonic battery no longer works, but these inexpensive replacements still work great! I accidentally kinda crushed one and had to repair it with tape and it still works better than the original Panasonic battery. I am still using the camera so am buying a couple more of these batteries because they're inexpensive and work great. Thanks for a good product."
3,Panasonic camera battery,Received battery in fine time and shape. Battery worked fine for a few months but now it just doesn't hold a charge for very long. It has faded. It was a good alternative to the overly expensive Panasonic battery however.
3,"These are 1100mAh, not 1300mAh.","The Amazon page as of 09/21/07 describes these as 1300mAh batteries. They are NOT. They are 1100mAh. The pictures seem to rotate, but one of them has the specs printed on the battery - and it says 1100mAh.The vendor claims the mistake is Amazon's. If you visit the page several times, you will see that the vendor names change, so indeed it may be Amazon's error. I didn't catch that until after I had received the batteries I ordered.The Panasonic original is 1000mAh, so maybe you are getting a bit more energy in this OEM replacement. Difficult to tell without running a well structured test and for an inexpensive battery, I'm not about to invest the time. They seem to work and that's all I ask.Jerry"
4,Panasonic Battery Replacement - Spare,Charged OK. Fits OK. Works OK. 1/8 the cost of the Panasonic battery for the same performance.
2,huh?,"Missing alot of good stuff on here, where is Portrait of Tracy??? Donna Lee?? 6-4 Jam????This is an Okay overall image, but your missing alot and this is a horrible album to base your view on Jaco on. Get his self titled solo album."
4,jaco punk jazz,What can you say about one the worlds greatest bass players.His influence is unquestionable. most of his best tunes are on here. Cant go wrong with jaco.
4,Two thumbs for Jaco,An excellent collection Of Jaco Pastorius' music and performances.I did not know much about him but this has helped me to hear his uniquetalents.
3,"good but not great, nor essential","While I do think a compilation of Jaco's complete works is well over-due, I think this cd could have been better. As soon as this disc came out I rushed out to buy it. I do enjoy the few tracks that were previously unreleased, I felt this was a poor rehash of all of his material.The first disc is quite good, I felt the second disc is pretty uninpired. I have both his first album and Word Of Mouth already, and to be honest I do not need another copy of WOM, which is basically what the second disc is. Usually Rhino is really good at finding interesting alternate takes and such to put on these rereleases they are famous for. I just found this one fell short."
1,"Blade works well, but the sleeves kept sliding off.","I think the blade is okay, but the sleeves kept sliding off. It is hard to hold on to the clipper when the sleeves kept sliding and doesn't give me a good grip. Makes me nervous that it will slip mid-clip and I will end up clipping my dog's quick. I wouldn't use these again. I also had to stop after every clip in order to readjust the sleeves. It slowed down the whole process. Also, the blade seems to dull after a few sessions."
2,not cutting as good after short use,"I've only used this a few times on my Great Dane, it's not cutting as evenly as in the beginning. Wondering if it's just not adequate for a Great Dane."
5,EXCELLENT,"I CANNOT BELIEVE I WAITED THIS LONG AND WAS SO SCARED TO CUT MY BICHON'S NAIL'S.i have used other clippers and they scared the heck out of my dog and me and every now and then i would make her bleed. this product was so economical, so quick and easy to use. i never have to worry about cutting too close to the quick anymore i like the guide. some people have said it didn't let them cut enough, i like to do my dogs twice monthly because their nails get so long and sharp. i would recommend this inexpensive clipper to anyone nervous cutting their own dogs or other pets nails. i wish i had found these sooner and i just can't believe how cheap they are - great gift to the person nervous about cutting their own animals nails. i have used this product four times so far"
4,Nice sharp clipper!,"These were recommended to me by a groomer who uses only this brand. We've only used them once, but were impressed by the sharpness and strength. Time will be the real test but so far so good!"
4,Great clippers for dogs with straight nails!,"We ordered these nail clippers for our 5 dogs and loved them so much that we ordered 2 more for extras - one is used at our boarding kennel. Found out these clippers do not work for dogs with very curved nails as you can't get the clippers in under the curved part. But for dogs with straight nails, they work great - very sharp. Have only had them for a few months, so not sure how long they will stay sharp (which is why we ordered 2 more pair!)"
2,Printed with Made in USA when it was Made in Taiwan,"I purchased these clippers because it clearly is marked on the front of the package that they are Made in the USA. When they arrived, they are marked that they are Made in Taiwan. This is deceptive and misleading marketing. I hope Amazon takes the appropriate action."
2,Yikes!,"When I was clipping my pitbull's nails (they are so sharp and getting long!), the so called ""safety-guard"" failed and doesn't work at all. There was blood everywhere in my bathroom with barely any nail clipped, the nails came out super rugged as well (even worse than before i clipped them). Now, I know not to use the safety guard, however I already knew how to clip a dog's nails (where to clip and being careful about black nails) and I would suggest you learn how to clip dog's nails before performing this task! However, don't rely on the built in safety guard! These are very sharp, which isnt a bad thing, however there are better clippers out there that can prevent clipping too close to the vein."
4,better than the expensive ones!,I have two large dogs and have purchased multiple nail clippers and have found this one to be the best. It does a smooth clip and is very sharp. It looses one star because the red rubber covering the handle slips down while using the clippers and also because the shape of the cutter makes it harder to clip dew claws.
5,Easy to use for first time user.,Really easy to use even for a first time user like me!!Cut both of my dogs' nails in 5 mins and the most important part is that they were really calm. All because this little nail clipper is really sharp so it's so quik and easy to cut their nails. I also love the stopper on the back so I don't cut their nails too much.
4,millers forge pet nail clippers,Much better and easier to use than the guillotine type clippers. My pets nails are much easier to clip now.
3,"pretty good cuts, one issue","these are nice, but they could be better. they cut great, but the way the cutting part is, it kind of requires that more nail is made available. well not all cats are gonna like their knuckle smushed further than necessary. Mine is a little troublesome. It's a guaranteed product. the handles could be a little more thick or wide, they feel too narrow. I trust the quality, not so much the design. Could be better. Frankly it's hard to find the right ones for cats. I thought these would be it. I'll keep my eyes open, but I'm happy with how these cut for now. If there was a better choice i would have went with it."
3,Made in Taiwan.,"These clippers are fine, and the price is decent.The image clearly shows 'Made in the USA' on the package, however the item received was made in Taiwan."
3,Good enough,Worth the money. The plastic handle-wraps are not grippy so they slide around. You will probably throw them away too.
5,Very nice quality,"I previously used those ""guillotine"" style nail trimmers on my cat but I really really prefer these instead. My cat did not put up any fuss about having his nails trimmed with these clippers because they gave a nice clean cut to the nails and did not cause the nails to get crushed or splintered like guillotine clippers tend to do. I also like that these clippers have that built-in guard so that you don't accidentally trim the nails too short. It's a great feature and ensures you won't cut into the quick of the pets nails."
2,Handle grip slides off,"The blades actually work ok, but the 'non-slip' grip that covers the handle is just a sleeve that isn't glued on. The sleeves are constantly sliding down, which means I have to stop after EVERY NAIL and readjust. I wouldn't buy them again- I bought a different pair. I was having to hold my dog still too long, and I was afraid that they'd slip mid-clip and I'd hurt him. :-("
5,The Best,Nothing on the market will help you effectively and inteptly maim your beloved pet like these! The quality of these clippers cannot be topped. The maiming is clearly attributed to my hubris in home pet care. I have had these forever and they are still plenty sharp and just as good as the day I bought them. This is a quality made product.
3,Good Value,"Not bad but Amazon doesn't carry it anymore. I bought it for around $5.00. I've heard the pet nail dremel is better.Dremel 761-03 7,000/14,000 RPM Cordless Pet Nail Grooming Rotary Tool for $21.81 via Amazon with free shipping."
3,very cheaply made,"You get what you pay for...good price but poor quality, however does have some weight to them so, they may last longer than others. But do you want them to?"
1,Not well made.,Unfortunately this was used three times and then fell apart...my dog has normal claws and on the third attempt the clippers fell apart and hurt the dog.
1,Made my dogs bleed everywhere!!!,"This is a terrible product. I used it on both my dogs exactly how the directions tell you to use it with the stopper so you don't cut too deep...well it didn't matter.Of the 10 toes I had cut, 3 of them bled for quite a while. My dogs also yipped when I cut those nails.I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!! It'll save you a mess and hurting your dogs."
3,Critical or Hostile?,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. Stump has written a well crafted history of the Progressive Rock movement (a daunting task) but has managed to insult most of the movers and shakers. He qualifies his name-droppings with some very nasty adjectives which tended to make me quite angry at times. Very few performers escaped this fate (Fripp and Bruford are the two that come to mind). I grew to question whether he liked the genre at all. His eye is very critical, very very critical.Nevertheless, the book is an excellent chronological history of the Prog. movement and the fact that he succeeds is commendable.For me, I am glad that I read it but I prefer Macan's book, in all truth."
4,Never Give a Synthesizer an Even Break,"This covers the history of English Progressive rock almost exclusively, with short detours to the continent and the US. His style is early Thesaurus (I've never heard of some of these words), with heavy criticism for any not meeting his high standards. The best part were the stories of early experimentation, how the bands were treated by the media (chumps then heroes), and how the music interracted with current culture. Stump opened my eyes to many bands I've never known like Gilgamesh, Flash, and The Enid. His musical criticism style is somewhat harsh for diehard fans of Yes, Strawbs, or Keith Emerson, but he saves praises for his heroes at the end of the book. Includes a great list of recordings."
1,Junk,Was broken when I got it. Im not sure if i would have enjoyed it or not sue to being broken right out of the box. Return wasn't too bad though.
5,Great product.,This is exactly what the wife and I were looking for. Its nice because it isn't too large or too small for the amount of wine we drink.
2,BEWARE: openings not big enough for standard wine glass,This rack... although beautiful... does not hold any of my wine glasses nor my mexican margarita and martini glasses. I really wanted it to display these glasses conveniently above my bar. My next project will be to find a wire rack that is big enough and do a cuctom install onto the wood base
1,Boooring,"The only half decent song is Kill City, and they didn't even write it. If you're having trouble sleeping, I'd recommend this CD instead of a sleeping pill."
1,Extremely Poor Quality DVD,"The DVD is so bad that it hangs every few words. I can't rate the content because I have had so much difficulty playing the DVD. Based upon the other reviews, I must have gotten a bad DVD. I'll see about getting a replacement and then update this review."
3,The Muslim Point of View,"Syyed Nasr knows his subject thoroughly and argues forcefully from a Muslim believer's point of view. However, as a Westerner, I felt more rebuked than appealed to by his somewhat condescending tone. The scholarship delivers more of an apology than an objective analysis. It is valuable to someone who seeks a Muslim's view of his own religion. [...]"
4,Awesome watch,Awesome watch but not for the small wristed. Readings are not exact but temperature etc comes very close to actual reading.
4,"It's big, but it's good","This watch is the largest watch I've owned, but it doesn't weigh down your arm. It also looks stylish as it tapers out a bit at the bottom to hide the true size.The watch face is stainless steel, but I believe the strap is titanium (it says ""Base Titanium"" on the clasp. It is one of the only watches I've owned that does not pinch my arm hair -- huge plus. Because of this, I wear this watch daily and only occasionally put it away in favor of my dress watch.The compass can be a life-saver when traveling without a GPS in the rental car. However, it takes about 10 minutes to properly tune it.The battery is solar-charged. I left the watch by an open window for a day about a year ago, and it still claims to have a full charge today.Overall, this is a terrific watch and a great value if you're looking for digital compass, altimeter, etc. I only deducted one star for the size."
1,Horrible fit and finish!,"I tried it on...and was immediately disappointed! It looks MUCH MUCH better in pictures than in the metal. I immediately returned it! Don't waste your time with this Pathfinder. The fit and finish was horrible---there were inconsistencies in the fit of the case and the case back, making its water resistance suspect. I have several G-Shocks, and they look and feel much better."
5,Magic!,"Of all the pieces that Feldman wrote for Flute, Piano, and/or mallet percussion, this is the recording and performance to get. I prefer this ensemble to the ones on the Hat Art label, although some of them are good too.The piece is magic. It is evocative of underwater images of slowly undulating objects, flowing movements at different speeds, yet very peaceful. Everything has natural movements, they just take their course.This has been a piece I have never stopped returning to."
5,Cashmere Bouquet Powder,I have used this powder after a shower for many years but I am having trouble finding it locally. It used to be available in drugstores and grocery stores but for some reason these stores no longer carry it. I think it is a little pricey but I will continue to buy it if I am able to find it. I like the texture and the light fragrance of the powder.
5,Perfect powder from the past,This is the powder my mom remembers using when she was young. I found it at Amazon and ordered it. It came so quickly. Mom was so surprised Christmas morning when she opened it and the fragrance brings back fond memories. Thanks Amazon.
5,Cashmere Bouguet body powder,My Mom has been using this product for years. It's the only one that she's not allergic to. When we moved to Maryland we were unable to find it in any store. Driving back to NJ for this was out of the question. When we were up visiting I could stock up but now we can't find it there either. I ordered this one evening and in less than 2 days I received it. Thanks for your help.
3,Entertaining...but where's God??,"Our 2yo seems to like this DVD so I gave it 3 stars. It starts off with a walking Bible which opens to Genesis and begins with...""God created the heavens and the earth"". What follows includes a bunch of painted gloves which pick up plastic cups looking for things, and colorful images flashing on the screen, and pictures of babies, for 30 minutes. I never really got the ""God"" connection. Don't buy this looking for a babies introduction to Scripture, or something."
2,Disappointed in quality but good intentioned,"I bought this video for my 2 year-old because I wanted to share our Christianwith our daughter. While the video is of decent quality, I just did not feel like it was educational nor did I feel that my baby was particularly interested in watching the video. That is unfortunate because I was very excited about the video. I still laud their attempt to make this kind of a product but I think there are others that I might look to before buying another of the Baby Faith series."
1,Not a good bible-story video for children,"I must say that this video did not meet my expectations for a bible-story video for children. There was no real story in the entire video. I sat with my daughter waiting to hear the creation story from the bible but instead saw random images of toys that had no relationship to the story. In general, I highly recommend either Baby Miracle or Praise Baby."
2,weak video,I purchased the God Made Me video for my daughter and was very disappointed to find that there was no storyline or real message to the video. The video was just a bunch of toys and a few puppets. I was very disappointed in the content and believe that this video is not what it is marketed to be. This video does not even come close to the Baby Einstein Series.
2,unhappy father,"I watched the God Made Me video with my child and was very unhappy with the quality of the video. While there were some nice images, I did not find it at all to be biblical nor did my child find the images entertaining. I much prefer the Baby Miracle video of Story of Creation over the God Made Me series. I was disappointed in the music as well, which was not religious or upbeat for my child."
3,"ok DVD, but there are better ones","This is an ok DVD for babies. It held my four-month-old's attention for a few minutes. The ""Praise Baby"" series is much better, though. It holds her interest longer and I don't mind watching it over and over."
2,Scary!,"My twin two-year-olds were totally freaked out by the disembodied hand at the very beginning of this video. They cried for half an hour (even though we shut it off). I have never seen them react that way to anything ... and we watch a lot of videos (Baby Einstein, especially)."
5,Great for Babies!,"I found the God Made Me video to be the only video that kept my baby's attention for over 3 minutes. We've tried the other Christian videos and even the Baby Einstein products which our baby tunes out in a very short time. But God Made Me had lots of songs for little ears, creative and unique puppets shows that each have a little bible story, an animated Bible Book character that keeps popping up throughout the show (much to my baby's delight!). What a great mix of spiritual values and teaching tools for babies!"
4,Baby Faith God made me,I like these Baby Faith videos....simply because they play Christian music and teach biblical stories. .. I like them better than Baby Einstein!
4,"Good, but better for puppy owners.","We got a rottweiller from the shelter. He is a year old, and this book is definately geared toward puppies, and purebred rotties. Useful information though."
2,great science lesson,"This is the first book or internet site I've found that explains the science of eczema. Very interesting and useful information. I bathe better now and notice a difference. My complaint with the book is his push to use drugs, like all the other dermatoligists who seems to care less about a person's long term health. ""Take these creams and come back next months with your money"" I can control my breakouts with the food I eat and there are countless other people saying the same thing. I also use an herbal cream that works as good as the steroid cream I was prescribed. My sister-in-law stopped drinking orange juice and her eczema vanished for good. According to Dr. Nasir we should continue eating our Big Macs and taking his steroids."
5,Wonderful book! Great hints and great resources.,"I haven't found a book on eczema like this one! It answered all my questions (what causes it, how one gets it, what works, what doesn't work, etc). And it did so in a clear, easy-to-read way. Even the scientific chapters on skin anatomy and biology were fascinating. More than educating me about eczema, the book made me better able to get the most out of my visit to the doctor's office, where there just isn't the time to go into all the detail found here. After reading this book, I knew enough to ask the right questions in the office, and got the help I needed without feeling like I was wasting a visit. I'm telling all my friends about this book, so they can share it with anyone who has eczema."
4,Very informative,I learned a lot about the scientific part of eczema and how to combat it whenever possible. It would have been nice to hear the author's opinion on holistic methods or herbal treatments also.
3,Eczema- Free For Life- NOT!,"This book is informative, but the title is not accurate. Inside this book the authors explain how an eczema sufferer can try to minimize eczema flare ups, which is important, yet they do not have the information to make someone free of eczema for life."
2,"had to read, class requirement",Had to read this book for a class during my Master's in Social Work. Interesting points of view from a wide variety of authors. Not something that you would just pick up and read for fun. Although having different authors is a nice idea in reality it make the flow of the book difficult to follow.
2,Not for raw beginners,"This was my very first raw book. It's lacking in-depth info and does not have many recipes. For example, it mentions sprouting but doesn't tell you how or how long to sprout each kind. The recipes are hit or miss but again, there aren't many to choose from, and nothing that would turn people onto a raw diet. I'd recommend any of Gabriel Cousens books or Alissa Cohen's Living on Live Food book instead."
4,Sweet,"As my grandson would say, This is a SWEET! He is a huge fan of Beyblade and now he can watch them at home or in the car."
4,My son loves it,I got this for my son when he was 5 & Beyblades were all the rage at his school. He watched the series over & over again. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 cuz it sounds kind of like they're always yelling but I think it must be Japanese originally & when translated to English they have to talk fast as we have more words (kind of like Speedracer back in my day).
5,Fun cartoon,My Son loves watching these cartoons and this is another good one. The item was as described and was shipped fast.
4,Good vs. Evil for kids,"The Dark Nebula is still following Ginka. Ginka is the only person who can stop an evil Beyblade.Boys love this stuff. I truly don't get it but, every kid in my son's class and into middle school, loves this Beyblade stuff."
5,supplements,I can finally sleep better and stay more relaxed during the day. My lifestyle is a little frenzied so this really helps me. No addicting qualities and it really does what it says it will. You'll be glad you tried it if you do.
3,"Def. not placebo, but... eh","I was looking for a legal alternative to the one very cheap herb which does make me happy (iboga).This isn't cheap, but it is legal. And it definitely does something. I think rather than make me happy, tho, what it does is kind of make me less emotional in general. More of a robot, but also it feels like I'm swimming a bit. I sort of liked it but the GI issues were not worth it. Anybody want my mostly full bottle? It's yours free."
5,The Buffalo Diaries,"Like the popular ""Princess Diaries,"" this little book is presented as the diary of Emma, a young rural girl. Emma and her family are picking up the newest member of their farm, Lucy, a young buffalo calf. Emma tells of her relationship with her brother, her mom and her dad as they survive a storm and the summer heat--all with Lucy in the middle of the action. Emma's hope and enthusiasm makes this book a joyous selection for boys and girls."
5,Just what I was looking for,I bought this fort my cousin. She's so hard to shop for. Her husband told me to buy this movie so I did. She loves it.
3,"Not as good as the Mr. Freeze episodes, but worth seeing.","Some people have ripped on this movie pretty hard, for reasons they're never too specific about. I will say that this movie is not the best representation of Batman or Mr. Freeze that the Animated Series has to offer, but it is still very enjoyable. There are some really slick action scenes near the end, and it's always good to see comic book characters USE LOGIC TO MOVE A STORY! The problem is, the story just isn't that amazing. The regular animation looks great, as always, but the computer animation, while looking good, sticks out, drawing the wrong kind of attention to itself. Of the three animated movies Timm & Co. have released, this is #3. But in the world of Batman movies, animated and live action, it sure beats the crap out of ""Batman & Robin!."""
5,Another Great Animated Batman Movie!,"I was wary of watching this Batman movie because I thought it would be of the ""new"" Batman animation style. Fortunately, I was wrong. This Batman has excellent drawing (less streamlined and stilted like the new show) with some superb 3-D effects.The plot, too, is excellent. The tragic figure of Mr. Freeze makes a reappearance as he tries to save his wife using Barbara Gordon. Batman and Robin have scenes as both their characters and their alter egos (or vice versa), and Barbara Gordon/Batgirl really shines in this one.Only two things made me wonder: why did they switch the Batgirl voice again and what ever happened to the promising Barbara/Dick romance?Great characters + excellent action and plot = Wonderful Batman movie."
4,very nice,One of the better entries of DC Comics straight to video series.Now i can retire my original vhs copy.A must for fans of Batman The Animated Series.
3,Not up to par with Mask of the Phantasm,"This seems much more like an extended episode of the animated series instead of the self contained film approach of Mask of the Phantasm. It does a great job of exploring Mr. Freeze and expounding on his established character from the animated series, but it's less satisfying non the less. Still, it's far better than Batman & Robin, which has a surprisingly similar plot."
3,"Good TAS flick, but doesn't go the distance","Subzero is classic Batman: The Animated Series. Any fans of the beloved 90's TV series will find some nostalgia here. There's the classic detective work, an impressive motorcycle chase, great voice acting, it's all here. But with that said, Subzero doesn't go the distance. For reasons I don't understand, it doesn't spend any time covering Freeze's back-story (which is odd, because TAS are the ones who created it). Without this explanation, Freeze comes off as a real toolbag rather than someone making evil choices out of desperation. However, the film finishes his character arc extremely well. The last 2 minutes are the best part of the film. But unless you've seen TAS episode revealing his origin, you miss the full picture. Because of this, Subzero feels like a lengthy episode instead of a movie. It's good, it's classic, but it doesn't put in the extra effort."
2,Really suffers from poor animation,"Batman & Mr.Freeze: Subzero is a subpar release by WB. Especially disappointing is the decision to attempt to digitize parts of the animation. The 3d work is badly intergrated into the overall flow, and this leads to a very jarring effect.The story also suffers from a lack of Batman, as most of the movie focuses on Batgirl and Mr.Freeze. Maybe this should have been reflected in the title.All in all, this movie is passable, unless you're a completionist like myself."
3,"Good,but there were some flaws","The work on the soundtrack and animation was great.My biggest problem was if Batgirl was kidnapped,why she didn't use her skills to escape if she was seen beating up the attackers of the girl earlier in the video.Or,she didn't carry a two-way radio with a homing device to call for help.And the people didn't help Robin fight Mr Freeze,and how could he walk passed a lot of people with the two bears?The other parts of the movie was okay."
3,"Pretty good follow-up to ""Phantasm""...","This direct-to-video sequel starring Mr. Freeze and the bat-family is a watchable, but ultimitely forgettable flick. Sticking to the dark look of ""Mask of the Phantasm"" and the animated series, ""Subzero"" is about Mr. Freeze's final attempt to save his wife, Nora. It is better in every way than the horrid ""Batman and Robin,"" and is even better than ""Batman Returns."" But it's the predecessor, ""Phantasm,"" that has the true grit in the Batman legacy."
4,why no widescreen??,"this is an excellent movie. i highly recommend it. but, warner has released four versions of 'subzero' on dvd, all without a widescreen edition. i have this movie on laserdisc, and it is definitely a widescreen movie (unlike a claim from another reviewer who said it did not exist).in fact, it would have been easier for warner to have released a widescreen movie first, instead of wasting time and money cropping every frame.until warner realizes that this is not a kids only movie, and releases a proper edition, i will hold off buying 'subzero'."
4,Kevin Conroy and Michael Ansara make this Outstanding,"This direct-to-video is an outstanding adventure full of energy and passion. Start your clocks and count down the minutes as Batman and Robin rush to save Batgirl from a horrific death at the hands of Mr. Freeze. However, there is more than meets the eye than just a great adventure. The elements of humanity are heartbreaking. Michael Ansara as the voice of Mr. Freeze is one this best actor's performances. Kevin Conroy, who has been doing an exemplary Batman since the series launched. This is a good one."
3,Good,"This movie is an example of how superhero cartoons should be made. Good art and suberb animation, combined with the good storyline and good action, make this film superb entertainment. And to be frank, despite the fact that it is not live-action, it is more 'adult' than the film Batman & Robin. If you are a Batfan you'll love it. END"
3,What Batman 4 SHOULD have been,Batman 4 was a little under the line of OK.But Sub Zero was better acting and story. The story is Victor Fries' (Yes that is how you spell his last name)wife needs a heart transplant but noone deciesed in the ariea has her tipe of heart. But a live doner does Barbra Gordon (aka bat gril)That doesent seem like a kiddie story to me. If you liked this see Batman Mask of he phantasam. (its better)
4,Outstanding Animated Batman Adventure,"The minimalist animation really works here. Start your clocks and count down the minutes as Batman and Robin rush to save Batgirl from a horrific death at the hands of Mr. Freeze. However, there is more than meets the eye than just a great adventure. The elements of humanity are heartbreaking. Michael Ansara as the voice of Mr. Freeze is one this best actor's performances. Kevin Conroy, who has been doing an exemplary Batman since the series launched. This is a good one."
3,Not bad per se...,"First of all, I'd like to say the movie did a decent job in the portrayal of all the characters. I can't honestly say they outright ""screwed up"" anything, which is more than I can say for the majority of the Batman live action films. What I will say though is I didn't feel like it had that extra ""oomf"" that I have come to recognize in most other Batman animated films. The plot was fairly predictable and didn't involve much mystery, and the solutions to the problems the heroes faced seemed obvious. All in all, I'd say it's a fun little Batman romp for the kids, but not exactly an edge of your seat film for the discerning nerd. For them, I heartily suggest Mask of the Phantasm or either Batman Beyond film."
4,Fun,"For everybody who either likes Batman and remembers the 90's cartoon, a must have. This movie was the first to introduce Freeze's backstory."
3,Subzero,"Ok story bad animation should have not been released as a DVD movie just could have been an episode on the show from the 90's and that would have been fine,not a must have but for the cheap price why not get but might have been better just getting it through Torrent for free"
4,Good Reading - Although A Bit Uneven,"An excellent book full of interesting tales of travel by backpacking. Some chapters are very well written and engaging, and some chapters read like a journal entry - just the facts.The writer seems to be trying to find ""his"" writing style. Each location has a different story to tell, some better than others.Overall, this book is good reading for backpacking fans. If you aren't 100% into backpacking travel, this could be a bit dull."
2,A personal diary of back-packing as novel.,"Stephen Kear has put together, no doubt, his experiences of back-packing in every continent to give us the accurate adventures of Timothy. One expects a coherent novel but this is neither pastiche nor personal monologue. Kear is the person to write such a novel but what we get are vignettes and verbal cuttings from a scrap book. Anecdotes perhaps.The book may have been written over some time because the style and mood shifts restlessly rather than relevantly. The finest moment is in South Africa when the intrepid traveller gets picked up by a local and the dialogue is deeply insightful.But at the expense of plot.I bet he is mad that Garland wrote The Beach when he was sitting on it ten years earlier."
5,Excellent case accessory,This case is big enough for my kid's two shoulder rests. I think it's excellent. and I highly recommend for those that need extra room to carry violin accessories.
3,Kicker's Workout,"Let me say I like the material, first off. Sonnon is engaging and knowledgeable, but I wasn't sure when I should do the workouts. He has them basically split into tabatas for the different levels. And you don't progress to a more complicated move until you master the preceding level...makes sense. Some of the moves are equipment-centric. Clubbells for instance, Sonnon loves them. Someone else might get more out of this than I did; I'd give it a shot, I always say there's SOMEthing to be picked up and adopted/adapted from ANY source material."
2,Not the Best Hard to follow,"You know those books that use too many of these. . . 1888 (ci) [belg.] having to do with or related to: (types of) {relative to}. . . Kinda hard to follow with all that jargon. Simple phrases aren't in there. Index doesn't really organize the words or phrases well. It is almost written like a dictionary but not in alphabetical order. The book didn't focus on phrases as much as it did single words like ""cannibal"" and ""catacomb"" and so on.Not what I expected (very big and bulky book). I reccomend Heavens To Betsy & Other Curious Sayings but since the republishing of it (2002) it seems it has changed. Oh well"
4,Good for the new artist,"This book holds some of the basic principals for the artist attempting their first human drawing. Nothing is over explained and over worded, yet it still gets the point across. For the experienced person, it might be redundent, but still could be helpful.The pictures inside are all drawn, which gives the new comer a sense of what they are looking at doing. Shadowing is well developed, and the people are average. None of the artist drawings inside are abnormal people, so you won't always be drawing the bodybuilder.I give this book a thumbs up, and would suggest it for the high school age artist who is serious about going a step further with their art."
5,"WATCH, DO...EASY!",I have had this light kit sitting on the shelf for ever! Bought the video and had it installed in about 4 hours... easy to use and follow. Saved me $400 that I didnt have to spend to have the kit installed by a local bike shop. BUY IT! Well worth the money plus it is good for a couple laughs...
1,Cat Grass Plus,I am truly disappointed. I followed the directions and nothing grew. For the price I paid for it (not thru Amazon) I could have bought a whole bag of grass seed and planted a lawn for the cats. Took a bit of research to get a contact for the company. I have sent them a complaint.
5,MoonPhase 3,I am truly enjoying the whole Moonphase series. can not wait till 5&6 come out. warning. Its very Japanese. may not have a happy ending.
2,Clueless Heroine,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read many of Ann Major's romance novels and this is the first time I've been so disappointed. This is also the first time I've been tempted not to finish a Silhouette novel - it was that bad. Still, I forced myself to perservere to the end, continually hoping it would get better. The heroine, Celeste Cavanaugh, fits the stereotype of the dumb blonde from beginning to end. Her thought processes work in a circular loop with no end. She seems to be unable to articulate her thoughts or present a cogent argument as to why she must continually hide information from the hero, Phillip. Meanwhile, Phillip seems to be obsessed with Celeste's body and spends little to no time focused on any other reasons for falling in love with her. Finally, the title is misleading. There's nothing shameless in this book except how it shamelessly fails to make for a good solid love story about two interesting people."
4,Good overnight read!,"The adventure aspects are a little predictable. But I wasn't out for a mystery romance. This is a very good Ann Major novel abouta woman fleeing organized crime, and running straight into the arms of an old lover---that she rejected. A little slow to start.But the passion picks up pace, with a breezy romance story."
4,Great for gluten-free diet,"This pasta is not at all regular pasta: it does not tastes that good and it is much more expensive. But, it's nutritional value is uncomparable with normal and even whole wheat pasta. And, for ones who have to stay away from gluten or wheat, this pasta would be the perfect substitute."
5,The Best Pasta,"I found these at the national ""healthy"" grocery store and now, these have become our favorite pasta. We use them with red sauce and in macaroni and cheese. Healthy, low on the glycemic index, and delicious."
1,Existen muchas ediciones mejores,"Edición con muy poca calidad, además a un precio exagerado para una sólo obra, existen dos recopilaciones de Platón con esta y muchas otras obras más a un precio infinitamente menor y con una edición que sin ser una maravilla está mejor que esta, por ejemplo:Dialogos de Platón. Juventud y Madurez (Spanish Edition)Dialogos de Platón. Transición y Madurez (Spanish Edition)( éste contiene la República )"
2,I wish we could try this,"I have been waiting since before Christmas and it still has not shipped! That really stinks, if it is not available it should not be listed."
3,Last Blade 2: Heart of the Boring,"This game is pretty fun, but in general I feel that it's kinda lackluster. I really enjoyed the first Last Blade which I have on the PSone. But this doesn't really do much for me as a good enough sequel. If you've never played Last Blade, then I can recommend Last Blade 2, since it is a very well developed game. It's definitely a good clean alternative to Samurai Spirits, acting as a very good weapons-based fighter."
2,Nearly unreadable digital display,"I intended this as a gift for my wife's recent promotion at work, but when we received it, we both could not read the digital display, except when it was held under a direct light/lamp. It is impossible to read it in daylight conditions, in the house.Also, the manual sent with this expensive watch did not tell how to set the date, dual-time, or the alarm. We figured it out by trial and error.Beautiful watch, but it needs a ""Timex"" style backlight for the digital functions and a proper user manual."
5,Unique comparative approach,"Aldrich's review gives a good summary, but doesn't, to my mind, emphasize the unique contribution of this book which is looking at societal influences on immigrant entrepreneurship. There are oodles of studies of ethnic markets/ enclaves within societies, but this is one of the few that looks across societies. In particular, their result on the importance of red tape as a deterrent to ethnic entrepreneurship is striking and unique in the literature."
4,A comprehensive book,"This a very comprehensive book, that is very detailed. Although, I would appreciate that the author would give a wider sampling of different distributions. The majority of the book is based on the Debian distribution. There is a little reference to the ""other"" major distributions such as Fedora, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, etc."
3,Not really a cookbook,"If you are used to the O'Reilly cookbook formula you won't find that here. This is really and end-to-end user level walkthrough of Linux from the shell through the operating system and into applications. It's complete, but I found the text a little terse and stiff. Illustrations are sparse and underused.This book covers the shell, X windows, text editing, text manipulation, file system commands, network access, configuration and other common Linux areas of interest. It has a wide range of coverage, which means that even though the book is quite thick the time spent on any one topic is fairly light. One exception is text manipulation, which is covered in significant depth.This book is definitely worth the look, but you should also consider O'Reilly's ""Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora""."
2,Not for the fairly initiated,"I AM NOT A GEEK. That said, I'd have to say that this book fell short of providing me any really useful information. I've been a Linux user for about 5 years now, and I still find some aspects of it frustrating, but this book didn't really help me much. And, it certainly doesn't live up to the O'Reilley ""Cookbook"" series (not that it is pretending to be, just shares the name), which I always find helpful. There are numerous Linux books out there that are better than this one. To me, the hints provided don't help much. And, when I'm stumped about what's going on with my system, this book doesn't help either.If I were just starting out, maybe it would be OK. But I think I would probably spring for something else, ""Unix Power Tools"" comes to mind."
3,Sorry I bought it,"The books is full of information, but it seems that the author forgot (or ignores the fact) that all current Linux distributions have a graphical interface. The recipies describe how to use cumbersome command line tools, although graphical tools are available. I also felt that there were often things that were missing or really did not belong under the heading of ""everyday use""."
5,Just the ingredents this Linux chef needed.,"Even though this book is written over the keyboard of a Debian system. There is a lot of good usable command line utilities and programs that would be usefull on, I can only imagine, any distribution. This book has, so far, been actually fun book to go through, and I have learned a lot of commands and other things that I didn't know existed before. This is really a great book for the linux user who is ready to make the step from the ""newby"" stage to the intermediate stage, and beyond.I am glad I got bought this book.!!!!!!!!."
4,"Should be called ""Debian Linux Cookboox""","You'd think with a title like ""Linux Cookbook"" that you'd get a information not stilted toward any particular distribution. Instead, you get a Debian Linux guide. While the book is thorough, it's title is misleading.If you're looking for a general guide to help with running Linux, this isn't it. If however, you'd like a guide on getting started with Debian and how to accomplish a variety of tasks under Debian, this is the book for you."
3,"The Linux Cookbook is not for ""newbies"", rather for people familiar with the command line interface","The Linux Cookbook, 2nd Edition, by Michael Stutz, is a very detailed and scholarly book aimed at people who already know a fair bit about Linux, and are quite comfortable with using the command line interface.Do not be misled by the colourful title page, or the simple-sounding title - this book is definitely not for beginners.This book is staying on my bookshelf until I learn a fair bit more about Linux. Indeed, some casual readers may never need to know the in-depth information contained in this book."
5,A fascinating approach...,"When I first saw this I was like ""COOK"" book? but then I flipped through it and I saw the light... the whole point is that you know what YOU want to do, and then you look up the ""recipe"" to do that... it really seems to make sense, and I've learned a lot about Linux!"
4,Could be a little better.,"I like the big knobs. They are easy for my son to hold. I just wish the entire puzzle was made of solid wood and that the board cut outs were not made of cork/pressed wood. It makes it a little more challenging to clean little crumbs or lint out. You may want to look the shape board from guidecraft. I don't own one, but I do like their idea with the matching color to each shape in the board cut outs."
1,way out there . . . .,"What a waste of time this was (good thing it was a library book) but the author sets this in a future time without giving you any clues as to how far in the future. You need to figure this out on your own. Then the supposed heroine of the book comes up in the first chapter, but you lose her for the next 10. In fact, she doesn't come back in until its almost predictably boring. There is no character development or consistent story line either. The book jumps all over the place. I wouldn't waste my money or time and am not inclined to read any of the author's other books."
4,Why are Doris Dörrie films so hard to find in the U.S.?,"I am a huge fan of Doris Dörrie's ""Nobody Loves Me"" and have been searching for a copy of it with English subtitles for years now to no avail. I just rented a copy of ""Am I Beautiful?"" from Netflix and have fallen in love with this film of Dörrie's as well. Her quirky treatment of love and death, the truthful understanding of the many ages of woman, the assortment of languages and types - all combine to make a moving, funny, personal film which does not shy away from joy or despair. And yet the disc Netflix had in their library must have come from China!! It did have a choice of English or Chinese subtitles, but all of the menus and the label on the disc were all in Chinese. Exactly what do U.S./British film distributors have against Dorrie anyway?"
3,NO SUBTITLES!!,"I ordered ASIN B00005NT5E / UPC 4040316136488 fully expecting a Region 2 disc. It played just fine on my multi-region player.What I had not anticipated was that this would arrive without ANY subtitles. Since I don't speak German I'm not going to get much enjoyment from my purchase.Another version (ASIN B0002JC5RU) appears to have been once available on Netflix, and that version had English and Chinese subtitles. Netflix no longer has it, so I'm pretty much SOL on that account.I fault the product description for failing to point out this lack of subtitles, which would prove significant to many of us."
3,Very Sharp,Wanted a flip open knife...got this...opens a little harder than I expected. However after I oiled up the knife it was easier to open...so easy that while opening and closing the knife to make it flip open I cut myself. Be careful...this knife is sharp!
5,Quality Knife,Found a great deal on Amazon through LG Outdoors on an Kershaw Blackout 1550. This knife has the quick open assist on it and is built from quality materials. This is one knife you should add to your collection. Its also backed by a lifetime warranty.
2,Regular producto,"Primero:el libro viene impreso en un papel de pésima calidad(roneo o papel oscuro del más barato).Por otro lado el contenido está bastante obsoleto, solo lo recomiendo para principiantes y creo que el servicios de e-bay es mucho mejor que amazon.. el libro llegó con daños a mi casa.Atte. Jorge."
1,"Motherhood only, No nuts and bolts",Terrible writing. Zero practical advice. Mostly motherhood.I can do without the motherhood when I'm trying to sell something to keep my company alive.
1,unbelievably boring,i guess this is good for beginners...? i could barely get thru it mainly because of the writing. its insanely boring--there is a 'story in a story' in this book about the new savvy emailin' guy named ed who blows his company bosses and peers' minds with his super-hero-like email marketing technique...ouch. it hurt my brain to read.
1,terrible scrach marks and zero customer service from Emile Henry!,"I have three sets of Emile Henry Paste Bowls, after a few months of usage, none of the bowls are in good condition, there are hundreds of scratch marks inside, we have 18/18 stainless steel folks made in Sweden, we never had any scratch on any of our other plates or bowls. I tried different methods to erase the marks, however, not successful.. - I own two pie dishes and two rectangular bakers from Emile Henry, which didn't show any scratch.I tried to call Emile Henry, to see if the paste bowls used different glaze than other products, nobody answered phone calls, left messages without any response. I emailed them to, still no response.There is zero customer service or support. Product quality is uneven. I will never purchase any product from this company."
1,Reached their zenith on Necroticism...,The production values on the first two releases were sad - the musical ability was there but the production was so lacking that it is damn near impossible to listen to. When Tools Of The Trade and Necroticism... came out the production and 'sound' finally caught up to their ideas. The samples coupled with discernible riffage blew me away. They never again achieved that level of brutality. Heartwork had it's moments but hearing these guys play bluesy solos was laughable. Swansong should not have been released under the Carcass band name - the only similarity to their other works is the tone of the guitars. If you don't like death/grind/hardcore metal that's great but too see a band that did it SO well fall to cheeky song titles and plain old average songs... well I'm glad bands like Berzerker have come since (definitely followed Carcass footsteps in ways).I wonder what songs they played on their few dates here this year...
2,What?,"Wow. I am a really big fan of Carcass, in particular their pre-Heartwork stuff (though Heartwork was pretty awesome)but I did not like this album one bit. goofy song titles and lazy guitar noodling. I guess we are lucky they didn't continue on like this"
4,"Feels a little bulky, but outstanding functionality","Although the watch looks a little bulky i think at first sight i gave it 4 stars because of the intelligent functions in it. The users manual is very handy and well written too indeed. What i am most amazed about it seems is that the watch is capable of recharging itself at office light.The functions are also very easy to use.Added comment :+the thermometer shows your skin's temperature...+the light button hurts your hand when you bend your wrist, etc, when cycling+the light drawns the battery when you drive at night because the light comes up every time you move your hand...The watch is a great concept but the final product is a spoilage"
5,Happy Husband,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He loved it. Great doing business with you. Best price and fast shipping.
4,One Star Short,"I purchased this item because it had safety features that were imperative for a five thumbed person like myself. I may be all thumbs-but I wanted to keep them intact. I left one star out because, although you can get the gist of how it works from the pictures on the box, I would have really appreciated written instructions. A few step by step practice procedures would have also been nice."
5,stixx suctionware mandoline slicer,great product got it in time for the holidays and have used it since with great satisfaction always wanted a mandoline but $$$$ prevented this. this was affordable and is more than functional for what i use it for.
3,More Missing Pages,"Like a previous reviewer, I also had pages missing from my book. The pages were not torn out, the book was just defectively bound at the factory. Pages 485 thru 532 were missing. I bought the book used and luckily the seller refunded my money. Be careful with this book, there must still be a lot of them with missing pages in warehouses."
3,Missing pages (Chapter 16 and 17),"Do not buy that book, if you expect to find some information about auditing Oracle database or hacker proofing, as it can happen that this pages are simply missing in the book. So if you are lucky, that didn't happen in my case, the pages from 487 to 533 will not be missing. Otherwise the book is fine, and if Oracle Press was more carefull with printing and assembling the book, it might earn some stars more.It can help you to learn enough to secure your Oracle environment, but if you want to set the audit function and to track the hacker attempts in practice, you had to look for another source, if the chapters in a book are not there. Check the shipment immediately and return the book if it is defective."
2,Not nearly as brilliant as The Case Against God!,"As good a writer as Smith is, this book was not half what his ""The Case Against God"" was. It does not offer the same deep insight as I would have expected. It is funny at times and still slightly imformative, but only by a small margin does it justify the time and effort it takes to read it. Sadly, I have to say, it barely makes the cut of getting a recommendation by me at all!(JH)www.ministerturnsatheist.org"
5,More Philosophical than most,"Smith's work is really heavy on classical arguements and it's kind of confusing to the reader at first. None the less, his arguements against Anslem's classical arguement is profound. Beginner's should seek out another book, as this one is definitely geared towards those of a more philosophical background"
1,Why this book?,"I'll be brief, as perhaps Smith should have been with this ""book"". My honest interest in atheism (or disinterest in any particular doctrine of belief-systems) led me to splurge my money on this little skit.What do I get? Correspondence theory, representationism, Separatationism, Eastern mysticism, yada yada and then some ism. This pedantic diarrhoea could turn a chestnut into a monk for want of some sanity.Nothing against Smith, I subscribe to his monthly e-zine (google for it) which has an occasional point or two that makes me go ""Yeah, hmm, true"". But this book is entirely skippable unless you sport long hair/pierced tongue and operate under a leitmotif of ""dude, like, awesome"".Consider Atheism by Michael Martin if you are serious."
1,Horrible display of logic and word gymnastics,"From the first chapter Smith defines and then redefines the words he uses to make his point. The logic in this book is horrendous. He defines the term theism to mean belief in God in the beginning of the book and then later on defines it as belief in a higher being to support his faulty notion that God is an atheist.I'm in apologetics myself and I've read a number of good books on the subject of atheism, but this is hardly one of them. Even Dan Barker's elementary thought process is above these word gymnastics. There are a number of fatal flaws Smith makes in his arguments that would only give way to strengthen a believer's faith. I would recommend all Christian's to read this book."
5,Timeless Advice in this Well-Written Book,"There is no pleasure in hearing the word ""no."" Yet Azriela Jaffe gives every reader the insight how to move beyond it.As she writes in the introduction, ""When you run a business or appear in the public eye, someone, somewhere always has something critical to say about your work. You can't escape criticism, no matter how perfect you try to be. I finally learned to listen and evaluate criticism, take the best and learn from it, and leave the rest and move on. I can't please everyone with everything I do and that is OK. It was when I really ""got that"" that I was propelled to write this book, to help others who still quake from their fear of rejection and criticism.""The strategic insight is in this book for every reader. I recommend it."
5,A much-needed resource!,"Ms. Jaffe has addressed a topic that is important to many of us in business--especially us ""creative types."" I'm glad I ordered this book. It helped me understand the genesis of my fear of rejection and gave me practical information on how to counteract the fear. Highly recommended."
5,loved the stories...,if you are even 'thinking' about being in business... start right here...I read it from start to finish in a single sitting... too bad I didn't have this book ten years ago.
5,I love Emile Henry Red!,"These are fabulous, durable bowls that will last for years. You won't regret purchasing anything by Emile Henry. Worth every penny."
5,"Good looking, well made bowls.","I just received these bowls 3/31/11 and am very pleased with them so far. These bowls are nicely made bowls that look great. For what its worth I've bought other Emile Henry products; a cobalt dinnerware set, cobalt pasta bowl set, and figue cereal bowls in addition to these cerise bowls and am really impressed as to the quality of Emile Henry products. They all have a good solid weight and feel to them without being too heavy. More importantly, they've all held up well to various types of use so far without any signs of wear and tear that one would expect e.g. cracking, chipping, scratches. Granted Emile Henry is a bit more pricey but its worth it. These bowls also look great in addition to their durability. The quality makes them appear better than fiestaware but the color schemes and forms provide a pleasant informal touch to them that allows these bowls(and other products) to be used in a varity of situations."
2,Chipped rims,"I purchased a set of eight about two years ago. All of the bowls have small chips around the top rim, and a few cracked significantly enough that I had to discard them. At first, I thought most of the chipping occurred in the dishwasher - although I only use the top rack and am careful not that the bowls do not touch anything else. I resorted to hand-washing them, but eventually all of the bowls chipped. Too bad, the bowls are just the right size and very attractive. My guess is that the top rim has a little edge that is very thin and vulnerable to breaking."
4,Nice bowls,"Only noteworthy point is that the bottoms get VERY hot from microwave use. Other than that they are as advertised, solid construction and appropriate size for cereal bowl."
3,Defective - looks like a second!,Poor paint job on rim of bowl. White paint showing on side of bowl where red should be. Not the quality I expected for the price of the bowls. Returned for refund.
5,"Good, no false positives or evaps","i love these things. Even though i havent popped positive, it doesnt give me false positives or evaps!! must have!"
4,no apology,"i bought this cd for my 12 year old daughter. as a valid alternative to the lousy hanna montana crap that is being processed and shoved down young girl's throats now,i feel this hits the spot. some catchy fun songs. be prewarned it lacks real production value. it's a little rough to say the least..... it's what i would consider a little raw at times and the playing and singing could use a little more work, but i think that is part of the appeal. i'm all about supporting the smaller lesser known groups that are developing a great sound. that's what i think this group is about. it may not be my daughter's favorite, but definately amoung her top play list. i would also recommend other groups - dollyrots, go betty go, tsunami bomb, and action design to name a few."
5,The Unauthorized Teacher's Survival Guide,"As a preservice teacher, I have researched several dozen books of this nature, and I found this one to be the best. It is a compact size (for tucking into my book-bag or purse), and it has hundreds of real-world teaching tips, scenarios and situations for consideration. There's solid information on gaining insight into youself as a person and as a teacher, and down-to-earth and sensible information on how to be successful in the classroom from the start. I got a huge charge of self-confidence from reading this book."
5,"FANTASTIC, face lift in bottle!","This aloe gel is awesome, use it as an aftershave or for a moisturizer base before applying a longer term face care product with sun screen. I just cannot say enough good about this gel, it goes on silky smooth, dries quick and I am serious it literally is like a face lift in a bottle.My mother bought a bottle after hearing me brag about it and she concurs and she said it makes her make-up go on so much easier and spreads evenly while using less."
5,Wonderful! So Happy I Found It!,"I've eliminated any and all petrolium based products from my life; from cleaning my house to cleaning and moisturizing my body. This product is one of my favorite things on Earth! In the shower, I scrub my face with a face exfoliating pad ($2 at the drug store) and a little deep sea mineral soap that I buy in bar form. I wash my body and my hair with Dr.Bronners Castille soap and use a small amount of organic, fragrance free conditioner. After the shower, I Put about a tablespoon of this Skin Gel into my palm with a teaspoon on Jojoba oil. Mix it together and dab it around... legs, arms, torso, face. Everywhere! It is Incredible stuff! My skin glows all day and I've received many comments on how good my skin looks since I started doing this! My boyfriend and I both also use it as a hair gel. While hair is still a bit damp, put a little in your hands and work into hair. I scrunch it in and it gives my hair texture while moisturizing it. The wonder product!"
2,Unexpected reaction,"I bought this to help my son's sensitive skin and acne, thinking it would be fine because it's ALOE. Which turned out to be VERY wrong! His skin immediately broke out in a terrible rash and turned red! I had to wash it off quickly and give him some allergy medication.I don't fault the product, as my son is sensitive to many things. I just learned a great lesson to test before putting it on his skin!"
3,Flaky and inconclusive results,"This product claims it has pure ingredients, but I have seen no improvement in skin redness using this product. The flakiness of this product, while indicative of sap present, makes it harder to work with and has to be paired with lotion."
2,The smell,Someone please tell me this product is alcohol free? It smells like alcohol and I'm not sure I should put it on my face. I do not see positive results yet either.
2,irrita!,compre este gel para usarlo como humectante para la cara por que tengo la piel de la cara grasosa y casi todas las demas cremas me sacan grasa pero este gel me irrita la piel y no tengo una piel sensible.
4,Great for the skin,"I use Aloe skin gel for moisture in the summer and winter. In the summer, it works well for bug bites or sun exposure. In the winter, I use it for dry skin (Also use lotion). Great on the hands, elbows and face....I recommend this product."
1,horrible smell,"the color is gross and the smell is intolerable....WHAT'S MORE, it dry out quickly on face.... I really regret buying it, for it doesn't help at all and i am thinking about throwing it away"
5,Great Product used on rope burn was wonderful,I love love love this gel. I had ordered and then my austrailan lab accidentely wrapped it's leash round me while at play & took three months to heal. However I used the gel and it was healing without a scar. Then went off on vacation and forgot it. When I left a scar appeared in the portion I didn't treat with this gel. I was amazed. I am home again and apply it daily and will be using on my body now to see if it helps skin. I love this and am starting to read reviews to make sure I use in every way possible. I did mix very high grade lavender in the gel for my wound. I will be ordering this forever and for my kids ay college etc.as they will eventually need this. I am from a family that grows aloe so was surprised aloe in a jar worked so well. Don't sit on the fence with this. It's a miracle gel. Has a nice application and isn't sticky. Really great find for me.
1,doesnt help with scars,looks like good stuff but hasnt help me heal some scarring i recently had. Otherwise it seems great for sunburn and insect bites and stuff like that
3,"Just a typical ""cheapie"" DVD","But not too bad. Instead of just packing two public domain flicks into a static menu like most of these kinds of DVDs do, this one gives you [as I recall] two vintage commercials, an obscure cartoon about a cat and a scarecrow, plus an hour of ""real atomic bomb footage!"". It'd be nice if they gave us some info on the rest of the supplementary features as well as the movies themselves, though. this DVD is overall quite bland, but it has some funny moments, like when you first start a movie and you get this little intro (created by the Catcom company themselves) with little clip art people demonstrating how you should keep it quiet in the ""theatre"". So if you find this for a buck like I did, it wouldn't be a bad idea to pick it up just for kicks. If you already have the two features, House on Haunted Hill and/or Atomic Brain, then you might want to skip it. Also, if you pay above $5, you're paying too much."
2,Doesn't Work with Apple Optical Mouse,"We bought this pad and opened it up. The grips on the back are excellent and kept the pad in place. Sadly, our mouse wouldn't track on the pad at all. It would work on the bare desk but not on the pad. We will have to return it and try another."
3,Done better elsewhere,"Mildly amusing and educational, but falls short of the much funnier (and much more informative) ""Viking Invader"" by Paul Dowswell, a book with the same newspaper concept."
3,"Good, but short stories","The Viking News is a good book to give to people who don't know anything, or know very little about the vikings, since each story is short, and with out much detail and besides that, it is fun to read."
2,Sole too thick,"It's not obvious from the pics unless you look closely, but many of Propet's designs have a very thick sole and heel. I wouldn't quite call it a ""platform"" sole, but the proportion of the sole/heel is noticeably thick. Other than the sole design, it's a pretty decent looking shoe, just like in the photos. Unless you happen to like the thick sole design, my recommendation is to forget this brand and instead buy a similar looking Sketchers or Timberland."
2,pretty lame,"I don't know if my product is defective, I just got it in the mail. But it is not what I would call a hair dryer. It doesn't generate much of a wind and it doesn't get very warm. I would not even consider this something worthy of packing to go on a trip. I'm going to send it back and keep my nice hair dryer which is just a little bit bigger."
2,"Great size, but only the high speed works on the 250 setting","Bought this hair dryer for our trip to Italy. Perfect traveling size, but when using the 250 voltage setting - only the high speed worked. It got way too hot on that setting to use comfortably. I ended up not being able to use it because it burned my skin and blew my hair too hard to style it. I started washing my hair at night and letting it air dry. The low and high settings work fine in the states on the other voltage, but it was a waste to buy it specifically for the dual voltage piece and then not be able to use it anyway."
4,Excellent little dryer,"Excellent little dryer, but I would caution you that the high setting does not work in Europe."
4,Bad smell when used on high,It is compact and neat. But you can smell something bad when you use it on high. It is fine on medium
2,Andis Micro Turbo Dual Voltage Hair Dryer,"I bought this for a business trip, and it performed okay for that week. However, every time I used it, it created a smell like something was burning, which always made me uneasy. I still have it, but I don't use it unless it is an emergency. I would not recommend this dryer."
1,Useless dryer from Amazon,"I bought this hair dryer because it said it was ""dual voltage."" I took this to mean it was comptaible with England's voltage. I took it to England and even with the voltage converter it blew smoke and a blue light flew out the back. Needless to say not a good investment. I had used it at home prior to trip and it worked fine in America."
3,Misleading Information,"Yes, this hairdryer does have switchable voltage to work in both the US and abroad. However, what they fail to tell you is that not only do you need to buy and adapter to go from the unit to the proper outlet size, but you need an additional adapter to go into the wall. For those that have never traveled abroad this could be very frustrating. All in all my wife was satified in it's drying ability and ease of packing as it does not take up a lot of space (leaving her more space for that 5th pair of shoes that were so essential)."
2,Two settings: Too High and Too Low,"I am getting the funny smell on ""high"" as others have described. In addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle, it's also hotter than I can handle.The fan speed and temperature are linked, as there is only one switch. The low speed is too low, but you have to use high heat to use the higher speed."
5,Ideal travel dryer,"I've purchased other travel hair dryers from different manufacturers in the past and they generally felt cheap and didn't work all that well. This however feels like a much higher quality item, with dense glossy plastics and a solid and positive feel to the power switch. It feels like hair dryers did fifteen years ago....like an 'appliance', not a disposable item. It's also very powerful for such a compact dryer. Definitely recommended over other travel dryers, especially as the price is lower than many inferior products."
3,"Very hot, very fast","Overall, good portable blow dryer. I was taking a trip to Southeast Asia and needed something small and easy to put in my luggage.The blow dryer heats up very quickly tho, and I can never put it on high because it gets hot so fast and is extremely loud. At one point it fried on me and I thought it was the end of the dryer, but it somehow survived."
1,The dual voltage button was defective. .,"I purchased an adapter to take this hair dryer to Europe. When I arrived I switched the dual voltage button to 250 and plugged it in. It ran at very high speed for a few seconds --then smoke came out and it ceased to work at all. Then the button fell out.I basically blew it up !. I had to haul it around for the entire vacation so that I could return it when I arrived back home. Now I am ordering a replacement. I will have no way to test it in Europe during the new warrantee period.I am trying again, but a little nervous. I hope I receive the replacement and this does not turn into more of a hastle."
4,Good dryer,It's very good. It has two levels viz Low and High. I wish if there was a medium level. Works on both 110 and 220 volts AC.
5,Powerful Portable,"Small and powerful. It dries my hair as fast as my full-sized dryer and doesn't take up nearly as much space. Also, my hair (which is prone to fuzziness when blown dry) doesn't come out fuzzy."
4,cute hairdryer,"I like this colour.It looks clean and comfortable.But if you use the ""high"" level for more than 3 mins.It smells like something burnt.But it is not a big deal."
5,Compact dryer works well for fine hair,If you are looking for a lightweight dryer that doesn't create hurricane force winds this is the one. My hair is short/medium length and fine. I don't need a mega dryer that sound like an aircraft. This is a compact little thing that fits the bill. It is also a tad quieter than the typical 1875 watt dryer. Two settings high(hot) and low (warm)work great for creating a curl/wave with a round brush. Would recommend for short to medium length fine hair.
5,Best!,"I own three Andis Turbo 1600w hair dryers. Why? It has tremendous power and dries hair quickly. The low setting is very adequate. The Andis is slightly more quiet than most hair dryers. It's excellent for hair health because the heat temp. is modified. (severe heat damages hair). My first Andis is 10 years old. My thanks to the engineers! This is a very good product. I have owned countless hair dryers. At last, I've found the best."
1,Doesn't switch voltage!,"I bought this dryer to take on a European vacation with me. I was thrilled with the size when it arrived. I used it a few times in the States before I left and it worked great here. When I got to Europe, I tried to change the voltage on it and was totally disappointed. The voltage changer looks like you would use a coin or a screw driver to turn it. When I turned the knob, it fell out of the appliance completely revealing that it wasn't attached to anything within the appliance!! It was just a hole with a little black plug that seemed to be put there to make it look like it would change the voltage. Of course, as soon as my traveling companion plugged it in the 250 volt outlet, it began to smoke. What a rip off!!! I have hair that must be styled and I had to buy a hair-dryer to use while in Europe. I would never recommend this to someone buying it for overseas travel. It simply doesn't change voltage."
4,Best travel hair dryer I've tried,"This inexpensive little dryer works extremely well even on my long, thick hair. Of course, it doesn't work quite as well as my full size one, but that would be impossible. This packs up small and does an excellent job - performs even better than my Brookstone one, which I ended up returning.I've not tried it out of the country and I probably won't. I find it's best to simply buy these small appliances with the proper plugs for whichever foreign country I'll be in. This drives my dad crazy because if the electricity is converted to the proper form, he strongly believes that the appliances (hair dryers, curling irons, straighteners, etc) should work perfectly. They will often work fine at first, but always always always end up breaking and you need to buy a new one anyway. I've spent less money now that I've accepted that fact and have separate sets of appliances for each type of plug.Anyway, this dryer is my American plug staple - a great product."
4,Like It So Far .....,"Bought this cuz I had used one in a hotel & liked it & wanted something small for travel. Works okay, but have the feeling it isn't going to last very long. Hope I'm wrong, but time will tell."
4,Good Portable Hair Dryer,"I have had multiples of this hair dryer over the past 5 years or so. It works well - has a reasonable amount of power - and is great for travel, because it is so compact. That said, I would not give 5 stars, because it ALWAYS goes south and inevitably eventually just loses steam and then dies altogether. I have found that it can be somewhat inconsistent in power delivery - that appears to be a constant feature of this particular design, for whatever reason. Still, I like and use these and do recommend them with that caveat."
4,so far its working good,It seems to be doing its job so I can't complain. I don't really use a hair dryer too often and I'm sure there is a lot better choices out there but for the price and the size ( easy to pack) it seems it is a good investment. I would recommend.
3,Compact but could be quieter,I was surprised to find that the item was not as quiet as claimed. That was the feature I was looking for.
1,hair dryer without wall attachment,i received the turbo and the shipment statement indicated that the other part of the order would come layer the wall attachment for the dryer has not been received id like to have it so i can use the turbo
4,"Prophecies of the Bible, the smart Guide to the bible","This book is a very good study guide, for lay persons along side the bible, I use it as a study starter, for our noon bible study. the information is easy to follow and makes applications possible in view of our present times."
2,Just So So,"This book was disappointing, it only give a sample of Bible prophecy. Plus most of these studies of the are messianic. Also the author spend too much time give references to other Biblical authors - which is not needed. If you are a beginning Bible student this would be okay for you."
3,not as expected,"So looking forward to watching Luke & Laura....big fan! Please know that this is VHS Not DVD!!!! The box was scuffed on 2 sides and looked ""used"", maybe the age of VHS? I paid 24.00 for this VHS and am very dissapointed I didn't relize it was Not DVD.I do not own VHS! Will be giving this to a friend and waiting for someone to come out with Luke & Laura on DVD.....cannot wait :)"
5,Loved the detail,Luke and Laura are soap opera history. This video gives an in depth starting place for newer generations to the greatest super couple of all time!!!
4,Frank and Straight to the Point,"Diane Mastromarino's book is an empowering book for teens, but tweens can also benefit from her advice. Straightforward about concerns girls face like body image and school stresses, this book is easy to read and non-stressful. My little sister will appreciate this book as a gift."
2,I had mixed feelings,"My name is Elizabeth and I am 15 years old. I'm in eighth grade and I had to read this book for part of my schoolwork.I didn't really like this book for more than one reason. 1) This book doesn't talk about or include God. 2) You can't know all about yourself. 3) You can't be confident all the time, and this isn't even a good idea. Sometimes you need to look to others for help. 4) It's embarassing because it talks about your private body parts. 5) Not all teenage girls need to have boyfriends are participate in dating. If you're old enough to be married, fine, but that is not something which teenage girls should be encouraged to do.There are things that I liked about this book. It described situations that almost all teenage girls go through, so it's nice to know that I'm not the only one who feels like I've lost a dear friend, or wants to lock myself in my bedroom and cry for no reason. Also I don't have to feel strange for feeling too happy to do anything!"
3,Girls Guide to Loving yourself,This book needs to have an age range. Some of the topics are a bit explicit for my 13year old. She will not be getting this until she is a little bit older and mature.

3,"Great on function, looks need some work","This 2-lb medicine ball was the perfect weight when I first started exercising with it last December. Now I've moved up to a 6-lb ball, but some days I do extra sets with the 2-lb when I'm too fatigued to do multiple sets with the 6-lb. I haven't needed to inflate it yet so I don't know how well that will go. My only quibble is that the combination of yellow, grey, and black is kinda too busy-looking, esp. given the varied textures (bumps, thick lines, thin lines) on the surface. I prefer the simpler look of my 6-lb TKO Fitness medicine ball, but for the price this grips nicely and I'm set as long as I don't fixate on the colors and textures."
3,Not bad...,"Bought this 3 DVD fingerpicking tutorial set before purchasing (from [...]) Eltjo Haselhoff's DVD ""How to Play Fingerstyle Guitar"", which I had seen advertised on YouTube. Mr. Haselhoff's DVD is much better, in so many ways, that I would wear off the letters of my keyboard describing them all. Let me just say that the video production is superb: scripting/lighting/camera angles/sound, etc. Mr. Haselhoff has a very pleasing personality, and he gives very clear, logical instruction. His goal is to get you to a point where you won't need to have ""tabs"" for each tune you hear that you'd want to play. No more tab crutches!Check it out."
5,"poetic, passionate, beautiful","i have just put the book down after finishing the last page and felt moved immediately to see what other customers of amazon had said about it, and what other buyers of 'firethorn' had also bought. now i find myself writing my first amazon review, so all of that must say something... anyway, i am generally a fan of fantasy/science fiction (especially the kind with a medieval bent, like LOTR, or c.j. cherryh's ""morgaine saga""), but i particularly enjoyed micklem's vivid imagery and metaphical style. the narrative is filled with easy similes like ""...high on a rocky spur driven like a talon into the fat earth of the plain"" that brought the story to life in my imagination. there was enough action and excitement to keep me reading late into hours that might be more wisely spent sleeping. perhaps this book will strike the hearts of women more then men? i don't know, but as a woman, i loved it!"
5,Amazing,"When I first got this book I had a very hard time getting into it. The author's writing style was awkward from the usual style I read. Then, and I'm not too sure when the change happened, I couldn't put the book down. I found myself so emotionally attached to these characters. My heart ached with the killed they horse, I wanted to murder the guy when he hurt Firethorn. (pardon my lack of names, I read the book a few months ago)Sooner than I liked the book ended and the squeal was no where to be found at any of the book stores. It drove me insane.I highly recommend this book, but be warned it does not pretty things up. It is what it is from the sex to the rape to the hygiene. If you find that offensive go read something written by an author who is afraid to write violence, this writer knows the truth and won't spare your feelings."
1,Nothing much happened. I got bored.,"It started out so promising! I really hoped that the main character would grow stronger from her time in the Kingswood. Instead, the next hundred or two interminable pages dealt with her misery and how she ended up as a camp follower. And she was still a camp follower. And nothing seemed to be happening. And I decided I really didn't even like the character so much, and I didn't care if she ever stopped being a camp follower. So I stopped reading it. Truly, from reading the first few pages I expected a completely different (and more interesting to me) book than what I got. Oh well."
2,Defective,"Be sure to check your book before you leave the store. The copy I bought had pages 312-345 missing. Great job, printers. Not really all that impressed with the story anyway. Trying to make myself finish reading it after paying for it and then can't even do that since the pages are gone. Very annoying."
5,Glorious,I really enjoyed this book. It took 50-80 pages for me to really become absorbed but the last half of the book was a real page-turner for me. Wonderfully written; rich characters; and a vivid portrayal of Firethorn's society. Can't wait for book 2.
1,Avoid,"I found it impossible to like either the stupid and cruel ""hero"" or the stupid and whiny ""heroine"" so the story left me completely cold.And the advertised feminism is on a level with most bodice rippers. He hits her repeatedly, he cheats on her in a very cruel way and yet she keeps clinging to him, because he really, really loves her. What kind of feminist message is that? And she has the chance to make some money and become economically independent and her friend has to practically force her to accept. For a woman in her situation incredibly naive, but of course everything will be allright, because he really, really loves her. This has nothing to do with the medieval setting. In the real middle ages, many women were perfectly able to earn there living without selling themselves."
3,Smut-tastic,To be perfectly honest I never finished the book because the sexual references became so annoying in their frequency. The great majority of the time these references were neither necessary or enriching. To me they were nothing more than an annoyance.
3,He's the greatest,"I only liked only one on this album, I just can't stop loving you, he's a great singer and is truly missed, his singing will last forever"
3,Bit disappointed,"On the one hand, I like this cd. ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" has actually never been one of my favourite, but it's nice to finally have a cd version with the spoken intro (I just got it on my vinyl so far). I love ""Don't Be Messin' `Round"", it's a very catchy, fresh tune and you nearly forget it's unfinished when you listen to it.But on the other hand, it's frustrating, because, come to think of it, you just get the spoken intro on this cd. Both ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" (but without intro) and ""Don't Be Messin' `Round"" (exactly the same version) are on the ""Bad 25"" cd. So... isn't it a bit like cheating?"
4,This book was good,"In this book, Jess and Jeremy have to make decisions about College. Jessica realizes she wants to stay here in Sweet Valley while Jeremy wants to travel the country. While they are fighting, a character from the past shows up. As in SVJH. To find out who it is just read the book. Conner and Elizabeth have officially broken up after Conner finds out that Evan had a fling with Elizabeth during his absence. So he gets together with Alanna. Two recovering alchoholics should not get together. They are just baaaaaaaaaad for eachother. Actually, Alanna is bad for Conner. That is basically the plot of the book."
4,Liked it.,I thought this book was really good but there were other books with better storylines. If you like reading about conner and his romance with Alanna this is a good book for you. I personnally think he should get over her and go out with Liz. Liz is so much better. I thought the parts with Jeremy and Jessica were good. I luv em 2. I luv this series and hope their are more books.
2,uuuuuhhhhhggggg.......,"in my opinion this book was rather boring. i mean, conner & alanna just dont seem right together. shes trying so hard not to seem like a fake in front of him, but yet she does it at the beggining with tia, andy ,& evan. she tries not to show her true self, which is her main problem.though i dont really think she lied to conner about her family. i just found this book to be boring in all areas."
4,Conner and Alanna,"Okay...what happened to Conner and Liz?? Alanna is SO totally wrong for Conner, Conner needs to forgive Liz and get back together with her!!! And fast! I hope an upcoming book called BE MINE will be about Conner and Liz, Conner should do something out of character, like romantic..or something NEW anyways... Jessica and Jeremy are perfect!! Like a match made in heaven, though I was secretly hoping she would sort of get to together with Damon (again) and something would take of from there!Anyways..this was a pretty awsome book, and I cannot wait to get the next one!"
5,Works for Me.,Drive Genius 1.5.3 works for me just fine on my MacBook running Mac OS X 10.4.11.Can't really add much to it than that. It does not seem to fix permission issues. I had to do an archive and install as well to get rid of permissions that would repair themselves and then get reversed.I run it from the backup drive or from the disk.
1,Garbage,"Faulty, misleading expencive up supported trash. Charges for updates, doesen't work or do anything only mess up your mard drive, disk utility has the same features but it actually works. If you defrag your mac drive using this kiss it goodbye. Now they have drive ididot 2 out don't be a sucker save your money and stay away from this lousey excuse of a program."
3,A Few Runs Short of a Grand Slam,"After reading other reviews, I was all set for Prosoft Drive Genius (PDG)to revolutionize the operating efficiency of my eMac. I had to call tech support just to learn how to begin using PDG. The help function is nothing more than a PDF file; ""PDF"" apparently means Pretty Darn Frustrating. The tech support rep was friendly and helpful, though, and I soon had PDG operating. The Repair function did not detect any problems. It took the Defragment a few hours to run. After the cleanup, I re-started the computer, anticipating a return of swift operating speeds and stability. Safari crashed immediately and the increase in speed was negligible.In fairness, there may be other problems beyond the purview of PDG or maybe I just didn't figure out what function I needed to activate. At any rate, the software came up a bit short of my expectations."
1,Do Not Defragment iMac Intel Core Duo with this product,It killed my harddrive and the only way to restart was to erase with entire computer with the OSX install disk. I was able to plug in a laptop so that the Intel iMac acted as a firewire drive and grab back a few essentials but I lost everything on my desktop and my emails.
4,a little more flex than I remember...,"I used the white version of these 20 years ago and they were perfect for the streets and tennis courts that we played on back then. they got a little chewed up, but otherwise played well for the need. I got one recently to use on the street to not destroy my wooden sticks that I use on the dek. they're still plenty light-enough, but they seem to have more flex than they used to...when I take a hard shot from one of the grown-ups I'll feel the blade wobble a bit as it stops or deflects the ball. this isn't a bad this for a cheap street hockey stick, but it's maybe a little thinner and made with more flex than I recall the old white ones having. for the purpose and price, it cannot be beat."
4,Pretty good,You get what's promised. It does its job but the paddle isn't attached to the handle very well. Had to bolt it back together after it came apart but it's fine. It definitely isn't for people seriously considering goaltending but I needed something for my brother to hold to practice shooting at. The paddle will bend if you stand it up when you aren't using it overnight or whatever but I would recommend it. It gets the job done.
5,5 Stars for what its worth...,"La'Mule is a great Japanese Visual Rock band. This CD contains some great work by them BUT don't be too hasty on buying it. They do not tell you the track listing on here but there are only 3 songs -Gimmick, Eccentric Maxist, and a song that says Saiyonara alot *I don't know Japanese heh*But yes, I recommend La'Mule but for the price of this CD - its up to you!"
1,Bad choice.,"Terrible book....not even close to the questions on the CMA exam....Using this book for a study guide and doing very well on the practice exams,I failed the CMA exam miserably."
1,Like reading an outline,"This book is for the CMA and RMA exams. It is arranged in concise, outline form. So boring to read this way and has put me to sleep several times. If you are good at reading lists and memorizing tons of printed data, this book is for you. If on the other hand, you are more of a visual learner, skip this one completely. There are very few illustrations. Also, there is only one pre-test and one post-test for each exam. I find that extremely inadequate. However, if you have the CD, there are multiple practice tests on it. My honest opinion is that this type of review manual is not going to be helpful. It is just lists of things to memorize. The actual exam will be about where things are at, what they are used for, etc. The AAMA website has practice tests that are far more helpful about what will actually be on the certification exam."
3,Sheila Walsh: Good all around CD,"I live to hear Sheila Walsh. She has an excellent voice, but on this CD, she sounds a little thin. The songs she has chosen are a really grand, and her voice is too thin to cover the range. I really like ' You raise me up' but Josh Groban's voice ( HE sings this song too>) sounds better.This is a thought provoking CD with a lot of great songs. I wish Sheila would choose songs that make her voice sound good and not just good songs.All in all it is a good all around CD to listen to when you are resting, and when you are in a contemplative mood."
3,Let's wait for the second edition,I confess I was a bit disappointed with the book. I hope its second edition will be more 'Complete' than the first one. 'An Introduction to SQL' would be a more appropriate title.
1,had a problem with the sale,"it was at $18.64 but maybe because they just have 1 more left in stock, they raised it to $47.70, it caused me a problem with my country taxes 'cause they didn't figured it out from where i bought the product at 18.64"
4,Excellent read on Navy communications and soviet spy intelligence,Good story telling along with specifics on spy drama. Amazing read in my view on how unsophisticated we were on our security.
3,clapton never old,"Being a long time clapton fan I feel this is not his best live performance. The production of the concert is ok and sound quality is fair. There seems to be a lack of energy from the band and clapton. David Sanborn seems to be out of pocket in the blues setting, although he is a great jass sax player. Got to give it to Nathan East who always smiles and playes 100%. Keyboard player was new, did not like the solo in OLD LOVE, guess Im spoiled with Chuck and gregg. It was nice to hear live versions of his new stuff. There are some great songs there. This is a must if your a clapton collecter, If you want to see a good concert-unplugged or 24 nights"
2,A disappointing DVD - but not a total loss,"After Clapton Unplugged expectations were high and the recording of the Live at Madison Square show was unable to capture the energy of the artists and the audience, making much of the DVD dull and boring. One of the few highlights for me was the appearance of Bob Dylan toward the end of the show. I am not sure who decided to bring Mary Blige on stage - she has neither class nor talent. Her act does not fit and takes away from an already borderline production. Die hard Clapton fans may want to wait for a big sale on this DVD."
2,Big Mistake!,"I was looking for the Crossroads Guitar Festival as aired on PBS and picked this one up by mistake. Big mistake! This is a lackluster recording of a few songs from another concert altogether. Maybe it was a good concert, maybe not. Either way, this recording does nothing to showcase Clapton or his music."
4,Bob Dylan smiles! Cool!,"some great sounds here, well recorded and presented, and a few forgettable ones, well two exactly, (not with EC of course). an interesting synth solo by pianist Tim Carmon. Some searing playing and singing by EC. audience noise thankfully muted for a change. having just heard the story behind 'Tears in Heaven' naturally I cried everytime I played that cut. you will not regret getting this. and, oh yes, Bob Dylan smiles! cool!"
3,A disappointing representation of the actual concert.,"The recent concert at Madison Square Garden literally left me breathless. EC came on stage at the beginning and literally played for three hours straight. When his guests came up, he gamely played backup for them, but unquestionably the best aspect of the concert was his lead work with he and his band. I was hoping that the DVD was a recording of the entire concert, but in fact it is the pared down and less inspiring show that was broadcast on VH1. I would still buy it in a minute, but it could have been better by far."
4,"Dylan & Clapton, what a dream","I thought I was familiar with most of Dylan's work but I somehow had missed his song, ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright."" This DVD introduced me to that track and it's a great performance by both of these legendary musicians. Of course the Crossroads performance was great and that's the one everyone talks about but I just loved the first number. What a joy to see these two men play together."
3,Just my 2 cents worth,When I purchased this book I had expectations of a book not a wirebound manual with photocopies of pages in it. I also expected more in content. What information was contained within the book is information readily available on the internet; one must do the research to find it. It also didn't give me much information regarding being a VA.
4,Other reviewers must be thinking of another book,"Having researched and planned trips for clients over the past few years, I have come to rely very heavily on this book and ""Blue Ridge Parkway Guide"" Volumes 1&2. This one offers lovely photos and interesting details of each overlook. You can get some of the same info online but it is not any easier to follow. Hikers may need more back country info but if you are riding the parkway on 1 or more wheels and you can only get one guide, get this one!"
4,very helpful guide,"I purchased this book along with Best of the Blue Ridge Parkway before a recent trip down the Parkway. While there aren't many photos in this book, it gives very detailed info about all the various vista sites along the Parkway - helpful to know what one is looking at.Good to have had both guides - Best of the Blue Ridge has many nice photos, but not much info on things other than what the author has deemed ""best.""Based on both books' reviews, we stayed at the Peaks of Otter Lodge along the Parkway which was very nice."
1,A Worthless Guide to the Blue Ridge Parkway,"If you want to know that the overlook at milepost xyz.a is scenic, this is the guide for you....all 200 or so overlooks are so described. If, on the other hand, you want to learn abut the history of the BRP, about historical events (e.g. civil war battles)that took place nearby and offer worthwhile side trips, or restaurants and lodging within easy on/off reach of the BRP, this is not the guide for you. Mindnumbingly boring, repetitive, without a scintilla of originality! A waste of money, especially if you are driving the BRP south to north, in which case you have to read this guide backwards."
2,guide to blueridge parkway,"I had to return an e-mail in order for them to ship this book, I have never had to do this before. The book is weak... but somewhat useful."
5,an amazing book,"this book is truly a work of art and love... Whoever these people are you can tell that they truly enjoyed making this book, or living the life experinces that they recount in this book. the pictures are beautiful and help greatly to tell the story of the recipes and experiences..... now..... All this could be the case and the recipes could be $hit... and it would make a beautiful coffee table coaster... but they're not... these recipes are good, from the five or six that i've tried, well written and precise. A solid introduction to south east asian flavours and ingredients with nice, acessible home-style dishes."
2,Nice pix ... little substance.,I have also reviewedBeyond the Great Wall: Recipes and Travels in the Other ChinaandMangoes and Curry Leaves: Culinary Travels Through the Great Subcontinentby the same authors with the same enthusiasm as reflected in the title of this review. All three books are bulky with pictures of people and places and pages of travelogue type information but there is little to excite the 'foodie' with far better collections of south-east Asian cookbooks. I have over 300 food-related books in my library and space requirements necessitate cutting out the 'deadwood' every few years. I doubt this book will make the next cut.
2,Not as good as expected - not even close,"I was disappointed; no combination suggestions and not grouped by sweet, sour, hot or spicy. Not what I expected and have put it aside."
2,Nothing special,"I was expecting a lot more from this book....Instead I got to much text, and not enough good recipes. Really this book is nothing special, and it is big and bulky!I'm returning it for sure."
4,Fun and clear cookbook to work with,I recently started going to an Asian grocery store almost exclusively. The recipes in this book require a lot of hard to find items but locating and learning to use them will pay dividends in no time. I don't recommend it if you don't have access to a good Asian grocery store but heartily endorse it if you do.
5,appreciating all in the family.,"With the disintegration of the family unit,this book offers encouragement.It shows the importance of all in the family.it enphasises the need for love and unity among family members.It is suitable for all ages and backgrounds.I enjoyed reading it."
4,An excellent gift!,My wife bought this book for me as a gift back in '92 & I have enjoyed reading it over and over through the years & using it as a reference. She bought it for the El Camino section. I need to buy John Gunnell's '73-'98 book next!
3,Pretty good book with good illustrations.,"Fairly helpful, but lacks a lot of technical information. Well illustrated and easy to read."
5,Upgrade from overviews to this professional treatment.,"Clearly-presented specialized techniques for studio work characterize this useful book. Work out with layers, layer masks, and adjustment layers to achieve realistic competency in design graphics"
5,Fantastic book!,It is a highly informative book with step-by-step instructions. I learned so much from this book and truly enhanced my knowledge of Photoshop as a tool for my work as a designer.
1,I want to give it 0 stars,A BIG waste of time and money. Look for a better product. It will work part of the time and just frustrate you the rest of the time. I have had more luck with 1Click.
1,"poor product, poor customer service","This product is garbage, do not buy it. The cover of their product states 100% satisfaction or full refund. Only if you buy it from them on-line. The product itself is not worth even looking at. There are better products on the market, do your research."
5,Works great,"This software works great on my system. (I have a Pioneer DVR-A09XL DVD burner.) However, it will not make copies of copy protected DVDs out of the box. To do this you must download a free program from the internet which you can learn about on the company's website. With this program installed, I was able to make a complete copy of a protected DVD without any problems. This newest version (Standard Edition) includes support for Dual Layer DVD burners and works fine."
1,One star is too much...,This software is almost completely worthless. It copied NOT ONE of about 15 DVDs I own that I tried to copy. What a colossal waste of money. Look elsewhere.
5,Simple to use,"One of the reasons I purchased this product was that it boasts a simple to use interface. I have 5 children under the age of 8, and this program has paid for itself already, I don't have the money to replace dvds when they get scratched. I was replacing broken dvds often. recommend highly"
4,Get off your duff and do a little reading,"Nothing's perfect. I've been using the basic program over 2 years and here's what I have learned. You have to get the 3rd party help which Google will find for you. Some discs, Sony , especially and alot of the Disney stuff have so much garbage in them, that the program shuts down. There is also a hic-up from time to time where a hesitation will appear and re-appear, through out, from time to time. Out of over two hundred copies, I say I GOT MY MONEY'S WORTH. What do you expect for less than $40.00 bucks? If you can't do a little searching to help the program do its thing--- you're too dmn lazy and you don't deserve it!...CTP"
1,Awful support,"This software worked OK for a few monthas, then became inoperative because of an execution error. Tech support said the program would not work with ""Dr. Watson,"" and referred me to Microsoft's web site. No luck. I called again; they said that they could not provide support for Microsoft software. If you have XP Professional, it may or may not work."
3,Its not McCopy you Lazy Lima Beans,"Straight and simple. It doesnt copy every DVD. It does copy a lot of them. Some DVD movies are CSS protected, some are not. Companies like Pixar and Disney spend a little extra money on CSS encryption coding- to keep all DVD profits in-house. I dont blame them. After all its a business. The Mouse IS a billionare ya know? So all you trendy people who buy their computers from Walmart because they have DVD burners... stay out of blogs about technology you dont understand nor want to take time to learn about. Some of you are trying to experience big budget movies on 20"" TVs anyway.it only gets 3 stars from me beacuse they havent figured out the CSS encryption problem yet.I have over 400 movies at home....some are copies some are the originals. Its about codes and profits, knowledge and ignorance. Which side are you on?"
5,copy dvds SOFTWARE,"WE BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE OF AMAZONS REPUTATION.VERY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE AND THE AID GIVEN US BY THE SELLER.RECOMMEND HIGHLY TO ANYONE.NOTE THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT WORK ON VISTA,ITS NOT DESIGNED TO..NO COMPLAINTS , AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER . THANK YOU AMAZON."
1,Email tech support=SNOTS!!,"Lord help you if you need support! On top of being rude, they're belligerent and arrogant.Save your money and your grief.AVOID!!!!!"
2,"Great Story, Judgmental Author","The journey the kids went on is fantastic and their two teachers should be appreciated and honored for all of their hard work. I enjoyed the inspiration of the story, but had a hard time getting past the author's negative opinions of several folks around him. He speaks ill of several people in the book, but doesn't seem to recognize that his ill will towards them is not unlike the ill will against his students which he continually fights. Ill will, is ill will, regardless of circumstances. I hope the movie is less clouded and really focuses on the true spirit of this story."
5,A Triumph!!!,"This book is an absolute must-read!It was writtenn byy MMichael Kersjers.a special ed teacher annd football coach at a highh schooll in Grand Rapids ,Michigan..He read a magazine article about Space Camp and wondered if his kids couldd go there.They had no programs for speciial needs chiilldrennn-exxcept foor deaf onnnes-who were gifted!!He started preparingg his ccclass-whose members haad everythinng from Down's Synndrome to turrets-far in advance.In this uplfting storyyy yyurr heart will be warmed as theyyyyy make great strides annd performm ffar bbetter thaan expected!This touching book is excellt even if you dis see the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie on which itttttt was based!I guarantee you'll be wearing a smile as big as tthe moon,too!!"
5,A powerful and inspiring book,"After reading ""A Smile As Big As The Moon"" by Micheal Kersjes, I can only say bravo! Mr. Kersjes has written a wonderful story about the power of the human spirit. I have found a new respect for all special education teachers. He shows in this book that faith and hard work can accomplish anything. This is a must read for anyone who enjoys stories of triumph over adversity."
4,Breaking Barriers,"A Smile as Big as the Moon by Mike Kersjes and Joe Layden is one of the most inspirational books I've read. This book is about a teacher that goes against all odds, taking a group of Special Ed. students to space camp. Everyone expected them to fail but he believed in his kids. One of the things that really impressed me is when three of his kids win the competition over the other camps. The story gets a little boring. Kersjes could have made the book more interesting in some parts, but the experience they went through is a great one and is inspirational for teachers and students."
5,!!!!What a great Movie/Documentary!!!!,This is a great movie. It is the best yet by T and S productions.
1,I'd have given this book zero stars if it were an option.,"This book is awful. It breaks the book of Daniel up, and then in between sections rambles on an on as if a mad-person was providing social commentary from an insane asylum for the severely overly old-testament thumping misleading confusing dogma where poor grammar and excess use of capitals and exclamations are commonplace. In other words, it reads as that sentence just did, but worse. It provides no common sense or rational insight into the book of Daniel, his roll in the bible, nor does it provide anything resembling an educated well researched reflection or objective view of the text. Avoid this book, it will disappoint you. Let me put it another way: I put it in the yard waste bin to become compost. Yes, it's that bad. One would be better purchasing a revised bible with footnotes and proper bibliographical notations and references."
4,A Good Book,"The title is accurate. If you want to learn about telephone electronics, this is a great book. It's easy to read, comprehensive and well structured. No, it doesn't go into great detail about state of the art modems or attempt to teach the finepoints of wireless telephony, but it does cover basic fax, modem and telephone electronics very well."
3,Pet Carrier Fasteners,The fasteners were fine. The screws were too short so I had to go to the hardware store and purchase longer screws. This purchase did not quite meet my expectations.
5,dog cage fasteners FOUND,"It was great finding these fasteners online, and soreasonable too. Local pet stores ""can't be botheredcarrying such items"" as I was told.........well.....cages do need these items replaced.........thank you for having them and the speed in delivery.......I will return to this vendor in the future."
2,Company shipping is very slow. Product is fine.,"Warning ... this is not the place to order from, if you need something quick. The shipping process was much slower than they promised. It took nearly one week to confirm my order, and more than one more week to deliver the fasteners to me. However, The product was as expected -- fasteners to hold pet carriers together. They're easy to loose, so now I have spares."
3,Screws too short,"There are lots of different kinds of dog crates, maybe these work for some but as another reviewer said, the screws are too short. Had to go buy 1"" screws for my crate. The plastic nuts stayed nice and tight for the 2 flights we flew. They are so cheap I bought spares just in case."
5,A Hidden Classic,"A hero with a troubled past. A modern day damsel in distress. Villains with competing agendas who are themselves interesting but keep you guessing. What's not to love? This is Elmore Leonard at his best, epitomizing the genre. Several mysteries come into play as the story unfolds. Perhaps the biggest mystery of all, though, is why this book never got the recognition it deserved or caught the right attention to merit transformation into a great movie. Whether or not this happens one day, the book remains a great read."
5,My Favorite Robin Miller CD,"I have purchased four of Robin's CD's and ""The Heart of Love"" is my favorite. I purchased ""In the Company of Angels"" from Robin while visiting Sedona and fell in love with it from the first moment I played it. So I didn't think any of his other CD's could top it, but this one did. It has become my husband's favorite as well.Robin's music has such a calming power to it. I always feel better when I listen to it...somehow more at peace. Perhaps it is knowing that it is dedicated to his son, Jason, who passed in 2002, that makes me feel a bit closer to Heaven each time I listen to it.Thank you, Robin, for sharing your gift with us."
5,a fne product,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday (she turned 10).THe book came in perfect condition and she truly enjoyed reading it.
2,not very good,"AT first it had a good impression, but after the first use just was't sharp any more and the knife got rusty."
4,Minor annoyances,"The blade itself is very adequate, however the cover for the blade slides off too easily, it could be a safety hazard."
1,Very old and odd articles,"If you are looking for anything you can use today, forget this book. It is an odd grouping of out-of-date articles the editors feel represent some sort of historical development; don't waste your money!"
5,Best Book on Strength Training Ever!,This book is a must read for those interested in straight-forward strength training with a barbell. The detailed coaching and anatomy references have helped my form and strength gains immensely.I highly recommend it to coaches as well as athletes. Finally we have a reference that does not sell based on pretty pictures.
4,Liked it.,A fun book to read from a guy with a good personal perspective. Wish there were more diagrams with lines indicating movement on them.
5,From a beginner who is alone in a garage,"I don't go to the gym. I go to the garage. I previously knew nothing about weight lifting. I tried learning about techniques on my own and with the aid of the internet. I'm cheap. However, after reading this, I realize that this book is very well needed since I have no one to teach me. This is definitely worth the buy, even for the biggest tightwad who thinks he can learn the techniques through other means. I'm now coaching myself and fixing my bench press problems and I can even explain to me wife to spot any form flaws. I also learned how to squat so that my knees don't hurt. Results are now starting to come."
5,Simply The Best!,"I have read just about every ""credible"" book written about weightlifting and weightraining. I also considered myself to be very knowledgeable when it came to proper technique and form in the gym. Two months ago I purchased Starting Strength and the impact it has made on my knowledge and technique can not be overstated. I realized that I did not know nearly as much as I thought I did. I also realized that a high percentage of so called experts and personal trainers do not know nearly what they think they do. This book is simply the pinnacle when it comes to teaching perfect technique on all the major lifts. Furthermore, it also teaches you to coach another lifter and to detect faults in their technique as well. If you are looking for an easy read or a quick fix without putting in the work then this book probably isnt for you. However if you want to study, learn, and then put in the hard work in the gym then this book will educate you like no other."
5,"Fantastic book, recommend to anyone who is lifting weights.","This is an amazing book. It explains how to squat, deadlift, bench press, military press, and clean - and takes over 240 pages and hundreds of pictures to do it. The section on squatting is 50 pages long! It really spells out all the steps and tricks to performing the exercises correctly to get maximum benefit and minimize the risk of injury. I can't recommend it highly enough if you are interested in doing these exercises. It was intended to educate coaches on the best way to teach the movements to their athletes - but its great for anyone who is going to do them as well. This may be the best instructional book I've ever read on any subject. And... it costs a lot less than back or knee surgery."
5,STRONG,"If your interested in learning, or coaching, the correct way to lift heavy weight and improve your athleticism then this is the book you should read. With so much misinformation out there and many experts, where should someone go for reliable information? Starting Strength. This is not a muscle magazine type book so if your interested in ""getting big"" or want to learn what someone else is doing this isn't the book for you. This book is about coaching and learning the correct way to lift a lot of weight and do it correctly without hurting yourself or someone else."
5,Great,"Easy to read, lots of references to other material to back claims up. Very straight-forward and informative.It also has lots of tips on how to prevent and recover from common errors in form, which to me was the most useful part."
4,Jackie's the bomb,"Fabulous likeness of Jackie. I wish Dragon would provide a doll stand, but that is not the seller's fault. A no muss, no fuss transaction, and a great bargain."
2,Lacks Detail and Lacks Cisco Related Help,"This book is worth half the cost. It gives too little informantion. The book is of little help with network related SNMP... just an troduction. I found Cisco's own documentation which is also a little thin, to be better if you are using Cisco equipment. A $29 book for $62!"
3,Hair dryer,"Even though it is a little noisy, this wall hair dryer is overall a good one. Easy to use."
4,Portable and easy to use,"I purchased this product because of its light weight and flexibility of handling. I am satisfied with it - it is of good quality, small and portable when traveling, mounts on wall out of the way, is powerful, and was a competitive price. The only negative is that I wished there were more than just 2 power settings. I find that my hair is now dryer, simply because I must now use a higher heat setting than with my previous dryer. Overall, though, I do not regret the purchase."
3,hairdryer,The on/off switch is in an awkward place so as you dry your hair you tend to turn off the hairdryer by accident.
3,Does the job,I like this product. The chord is long enough. Noise level is not too loud. Two power levels. The only reason I only gave it three stars is because I don't know if it's going to last.
2,The only plus - its wall-mounted,"A very ordinary, even mediocre hair dryer. Too small, which was hard to tell from it picture online. And its VERY loud. Sounds like a shrill airplane taking off. My daughter hates it and wants to cover her ears when I use it on her hair, even on the lower speed setting. Of course being a hair dryer it has to be used around the ears so...I would not recommend it, and suggest you turn on a bunch of hair dryers in person before buying it online. BTW, it dries just fine and blows air quite far."
4,Good value for the money,"This hairdryer does exactly what it promises: dries hair fast and keeps the dryer handy but neatly out of the way--all for under $25! The only thing I don't like about it is the noise it creates. I wanted to buy the *quiet* version, but couldn't find it available anywhere."
1,over heated,Over heated and shut off within the first five minutes of use. Returned to Amazon. Would in no way recommend
2,Waste of money!,"The dryer was great for about 3 weeks. It was easy to install and had tons of power. It dried my hair faster than my old dryer and was extremely light weight, however, it DIED! I was drying my hair and it looked like something was on fire inside and about 30 seconds later it shot a streak of fire out and quit. The heat source still works but the motor won't. I am really disappointed with this purchase."
2,not happy,Lost the low heat setting in the first couple months. It caught on fire before it was a year old. Wouldn't recommend
5,Recommended,This workbook is written very sensitively and very informatively. I am using this with my clients and they also offer positive feedback.
2,The interesting stories that could have been,"I'm a traveller and enjoy travel writing. I thought I would like this book, but didn't. 'Disjointed' seems to best describe it. The author spends only a page or two describing places and events before popping off to someplace new. These one to two-page vignettes lack a sense of flow, lurching from one event to another, neither beginning nor concluding. This choppiness made it difficult to truly understand the depth, or escence, of the places he'd visited."
3,good material marred by poor writing,"I could even forgive the ego if the writing weren't so dreadful. For me, the fact that he adores his wife and beautiful twin daughters makes up somewhat for his arrogance, but nothing makes up for this writing which makes the Let's Go guides look like Flaubert. Plus, the editing was weak in that we jump ALL OVER the place with no logical starts and finishes. I enjoyed all the travelogues (even though I hate that present tense stuff -- I see the lion, it moves towards me) but just as you're getting into the Talibans, boom, you're in Borneo. I feel like I read the first half of 30 short stories. Plus, a book like this with not ONE map seems a shame since Pelton has visited some great places. What was the publisher thinking not to include maps.Though I enjoyed the stories and even the parts about the author's upbringing (I didn't find much egoism here), this book falls short in the adventure genre since so many others write so much better."
3,Almost great,"Pelton has ventrued far and wide, to a self-reported selection of more than one hundred countries. Surely, in such extensive journeys he should be able to present new stories when he publishes new books. I bought this book looking not only for an autobiography, which was slow and repetitive about childhood and shallow beyond that, but for more adventures. When I realized that some of the longest stories in the Adventurist were stories that I had already read in World's Most Dangerous Places it disappointed me. Also, the book attempts to be artistic and creative by bouncing between stories much like The Things They Carried, but this fails in that sense. Here it is just slightly annoying and fairly useless. It could have been used well as a juxtaposition between similar phases of his life, but it didnt work as it should. The book is good, just dont expect too much."
1,The Reason Ghostwriters Exist,"Having enjoyed immensely Pelton's prior work, The World's Most Dangerous Places, I was thoroughly disappointed with The Adventurist. As another reviewer aptly noted, Pelton's latest book was a rambling 220-page self-aggrandizing press release. Worse yet, the prose is very choppy (jumping abruptly from narratives about the front lines of Afghanistan to discourses about his stunted childhood) and lacks compelling detail. Just when a narrative starts to become interesting, it simply fizzles out. In short, The Adventurist is a collection of short, disjointed passages that bluntly, flatly, and shamelessly portray the author as an intrepid hero, as opposed to a woven narrative that describes the author's experiences and allows the reader to form his own opinions about the author. The Adventurist would have been better served by a ghostwriter with a sense of literary style."
2,Seems too much ego! Almost like one large PRESS RELEASE.,"I'm also a fan of Robert Young Pelton's Dangerous Places Series of Books, but this book was a BIG Disappointment.The author was too busy displaying his EGO in this book. I also agree with the other reviewer that Robert Young Pelton could have been much more modest."
5,My favorite RYP,"If you've read some of his other works...you'll love this one.Here we get some background, some history, the ""backstory"" of how RYP came to be who he has been. The current and past flow wonderfully together creating texture and giving depth to this larger than life thrill seeker.I still am amazed at some of the things he does in his other books - and continues to do - but it does feel like this book makes it easier to understand his rationale."
2,durability challenged,mine was on the floor and I knocked it over a few times. while laying on it's face it would lose time and eventually freeze due to the mechanism being out of the intended position relative to gravity I suppose. I was able to get it going a couple times then it just quit. I removed the face and tried to get restart the second hand and that would work for a few hours then it would freeze again so now it's in the trash and I bought a seiko. if you leave it carefully positioned on a table this clock might work forever but if you happen to knock it over and don't immediately set it aright it just might die on you. not too impressive to me
3,Administrator's Guide to E - Commerce,"Although I found this book to be fairly informative in general, it does, at times, read like a microsoft ad!. Also I found that the author occasionally forgets to tell you what some of the abriviations stand for.I did find it usefull as a first time reader of this topic dispite the above."
1,Total CRAP,"This card came in my dell Inspiron 700m. Still battling with it to try to get it to work. Have tried numerous fixes- connecting via different channel, getting latest drivers, connecting securely and insecurely, reseating the card, connecting on b instead of g band, increasing power amount to signal... nothing has worked. Many people have been posting on tech support boards with same problem. It is either an incompatibility with certain routers (I have Linksys) or it is a stodgy card. Unfortunately there don't seem to be a lot of mini pci alternatives and Dell and HP laptops both come with this card."
1,Hidden bigotry,Abby Nye writes exceptionally well but the main theme is her distorted righteousness what she fails to see is the human struggle of those who have to dig inside into their own true nature to be authentic. Sadly she makes a mockery of self discovery.
4,A Must Have For The Christian Student,Knowing how to live your faith while attending colleges with atheistic views and professors is so important. This book gives very useful information that will help you keep your faith and focus while maintaining a good GPA and a positive college experience.
5,thank you,"This type of book is great for those who enter college and have a personal Christian faith. For those who don't, they do not understand the term secular from our viewpoint. If you think about it, most agnostics live a life that is not much different than an atheist. Back in the 80's I went to the University of Minnesota as a Christian, and a book like this would have been useful. Sadly, I think it is even more needed in this ever more amoral culture where right and wrong are subjective."
2,"Should be ""Surviving and Thriving as a Right Wing Christian on a Secular Campus""","While this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses, I cannot recommend it to other readers. The author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-Republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical Christianity. She battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all Bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel. Indeed, in reading some of the chapters, it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a Christian worldview that might veer in any part from Republican platform positions. This is really too bad, because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions. I would not have begrudged her political point of view at all, had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position."
3,Small Bowl,"The set seems to be of a very sturdy quality. I had hoped that the mixing bowl would have been larger. It's really much smaller (approx. 8"" across)than the picture looks."
1,Don't waste your time,"The critical reader who is looking for enlightenment regarding the Book of Revelation will find this book practically worthless. It is filled with unsupported claims and poorly reasoned arguments. The book's attempts to blend Bible prophecy with unrelated facts, myths, and superstition assumes relationships that don't exist. Statements that directly contradict both themselves and universally accepted Bible interpretation serve only to confuse and further obscure the Revelation prophecy. Overall, there is far too much conjecture for it to be a credible resource on the subject, therefore it is ultimately of no benefit to the reader."
4,Smoth Trance CD,Smooth is the Best word I can think of to discribe this CD. The transition in Tempo and the audio exerpts from the films such as DUNE make this an excelent choice.
3,A compelling and lucid diagnosis.,"Reich's analysis is inarguably on the mark. What is missing, however, is a discussion of the underlying psychodynamic factors that have led to the creation and perpetuation of transnational corporate hegemony. Money and property, as sublimations for a repressed regression drive, will and must be the central obsessions of the corporate-financial sector. Reich should have read Norman O. Brown's LIFE AGAINST DEATH AND Ken Wilber's UP FROM EDEN before he tried to devise a purely socio-economic solution to the crisis of private economic governance. The solution to the condtions Reich describes lies within, not without."
3,Reich is Right AGAIN,His analysis is INTERESTING BUT his recommendation - that the system must be stoppped may - to Mr Reich's surprise - come true - on 1/1/00 ... LET'S hope this does not happen !!!
2,Not What You May Expect,"I purchased this book with the expectation that it would give me some guidelines on how to conduct an interview as a social worker but the book wasn't totally what I expected. The majority of the book are evaluations that rate YOU as an interviewer on your interviewing abilities and each lesson contains a checklist of things that should be done in your interview. Some of the contents of one checklist include: open and accessible body posture, directly face the client, congruent facial expression, and so on. I would personally recommend not purchasing the book. If you have a classmate that will allow you to borrow the book and make copies of the evaluation forms, I suggest that versus spending $60."
4,Pretty good crackers,These are good per usual from Town House. Just have to get used to the slightly different taste. I like them so far.
2,Great for the first two weeks,"I got 2 of these, one for office use and one for home use. I do some gaming at home, in the office it's just used for day to day work. Within a couple of weeks both of these started curling up on the bottom edge (where you hand actually rests) and basically became unuseable. Any time you need to move the mouse lower or closer to yourself, you end up running it up a bump, at which point it loses it's normal flat stance and the laser sensor stops working. Both were thrown out within a month of use."
4,"Entertaining, but too short","""World Trivia"" is a small book filled with trivia questions from around the world. Each page has a single question with the answer on the reverse. It contains an excellent selection of questions that I found genuinely interesting, however, with only one question on a page it contains only just over 130 questions. It would have been nice if there were two or three questions per page.There are very few trivia books that have the nerve to ask questions on culture and politics because they change so quickly in some parts of the world. That is the situation here, some of the questions and answers are outdated because of the rapid political and cultural changes in the Middle East. It still makes an interesting read and is a great book to leave lying around for company to pick up and leaf through."
1,Not a good purchase,"I was very dissapointed with this book. It is not worth the money if you really are looking to learn some world trivia. It would not even make a good reference book. To be honest I am not sure why Amazon even sells it, the content is very weak. Save your money buy something else, or go to the library. I can not even imagine what the publishers were thinking when they decided to publish this book, truly a dissapointment."
2,"view from ""The Nation""","The historical aspects of the book are interesting. However the continual defense of Oppie's leftists views get tired and cliched after a while. It's true that Communism had not been a proven failure around the world then as it is now that we have seen that it fails everywhere that it is tried (eg. Cuba, Soviet Russia, North Korea).But there were plenty of men even then (especially military men) who knew that the Soviet communists were not to be trusted.Thank God one of those men was Harry Truman who was not one of those cliched, America-hating, liberal Democrats that pass for leaders today.I give the book two stars because of its extensive research. But it could have been much better if the authors had not injected so much of their own liberal bias into the book. But I guess you cannot expect anything else when the main writer of the book works for The Nation magazine."
2,Typically PC,"Plenty of detail and typically PC. Written by a couple of liberals who bring us yet another re-hash of the ""official"" outlook on Oppenheimer as flawed god who strayed off the reservation as defined by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Dripping with cliches and the the whole array of baggage that entails. Good as a source of information, decently written, but oh so tired. Why did they bother? Why should you?"
1,American Prometheus: The Ttriumph and Tragedy of J. RObert Oppenheimer,One of the best books I have ever read. It was engaging and informative and read like a great novel. I did not want it to end.
4,Loved it,"I don't read a lot of bio, but this one caught my eye. Turns out to have been well worth the time.Oppie is a very interesting character, and these writers have done his life justice. Lots of interesting stuff about development of the bomb and the politics surrounding it."
3,Where was the editor???,"I was really excited to get this book. However, I was quickly drowned by a lot of useless info as this book is waaay too long! If you're interested in everyone Oppenheimer ever knew those people's friends and relatives then this is the book for you. If you're interested in the details about the Manhattan Project and the physics involved, well you'll be disappointed. I doubt there was an editor for this book because at over 700 pages, it's simply too much useless info for me."
5,Great amount of Detail,I love history and this subject and would recommend it to any one whom also feels the same way. However if you are not a history buff or interested in an amazing amount of detail about Oppenheimer's complete life then shy away.
5,American classic,"Sometimes to understand American history, you need to understand the people that got us here. Besides the obvious history of Oppenheimer the man, the book showcases what was going around Oppenheimer, whether pre-war Europe, the Great Depression, WWII, and past WWII McCarthyism, and showcases characters that defined the feel of the era. It's easy to understand the pressures of McCarthyism, and the real and made-up problems of the era, when seeing it through Oppenheimer's own eyes.The book was fabulous, a real treat."
3,great audiobook but terrible format,"I am listening to this audiobook but I am very disappointed with the Format. This audiobook is divided into mp3 files that are only 10 minutes long. This is ridiculous. My ipod is not playing them in order so every time one of the mp3 files ends, I have to go back to the menu and find the next file. I wonder who thought this would be a good idea. I can see files that are 30 minutes long or 60 minutes but not 10 minutes. This length is too short. Otherwise the book is very good. I have not finished yet."
3,No Physics...No Person,"I was disappointed by this book. Maybe that is my own fault. I went in knowing a lot about Oppenheimer. He was a family friend and his fall from grace was a topic of much discussion.I was expecting a book that would link him with his ideas, his physics, and with the nitty gritty of the physics that was done at Los Alamos. What I really did not want to read was a rehash of the evidence regarding his political affiliations and the removal of his Q clearance.To me the tragedy of this man was that he could never sit still long enough to do the physics that he was truly capable of doing and which a little self-discipline would have ensured. It is quite possible he could have eclipsed them all and, quite possibly, have brought quantum mechanics closer to the theory of relativity.The book is superbly, written and eminently engaging. But the story is not new."
2,Rome Then and Now in Overlay,"It was complete , however not in the best of conditionI would not return it however"
4,Works well with DVD+RW disks,"This drive came installed in my new HP Pavilion PC. I picked up some HP DVD+RW disks and was able to burn disks and watch the video I created on a Sony DVD player without any problem. For cost reasons I picked up some HP DVD+R disks and tried to burn those. I now have $25 worth of useless DVD+R disks.I used the software that came pre-installed on the PC and other programs for burning DVDs. None worked with the DVD+R disks. I then upgraded the firmware from HP's support site, but still doesn't work. I sent an email to HP support and they responded with a suggestion to change the memory access from DMA to PIO. Nope. So right now I can burn DVD+RW disks but not the less expensive DVD+R (DVD+R are also supposed to be compatible with a wider range of DVD players than DVD+RW).I also purchased other software to use instead of the MyDVD program - Pinnacle Express. MyDVD is too basic and video quality is so-so."
3,Boneheaded install package,"Nice DVD Burner, good price, expect to waste a lot of time installing it. I previously had an HP CD Burner in my 800 Mhz box with 256k of RAM,, very clean install - install package choked because I had a previous CD Burner and the install package found it and refused to install the new DVD burner Software (HP Record Now) because it detected the prior installation and tried to remove it (too bad, long since deleted and uninstalled, however it appears the install has detected something in the registry which tells it to find the prior install log and uninstall the prior installation - too bad not there, installation is crippled and can't complete (what a bone-headed piece of softtware, who writes this stuff?)Another 6 hours wasted because big HP Software Company can't get more intelligent coders and testers. :-{RLP"
2,selector switch failed quickly,"I normally turn this lamp on and off using a wall switch, only occasionally using the switch on the lamp to select between 50w, 100w, or 150w output on the 3-way bulb. After very little use, the lamp switch failed. The part you grab still rotates, but nothing happens inside. Luckily it is stuck in the 150w position which is the one I use most. But I cannot recommend this lamp."
2,some problems,"unfortunately when i switch between the different light settings on the 3-way bulb it shorts out my apartment. really annoying. now i just have it controlled by a light switch, and only ever use it on one brightness setting. :-("
2,The switch broke within 10 days of ownership.,"The lamp was exactly what I wanted. The switch failed after about 10 days. It'd turn round-n-round both ways and the switch would do nothing. It then started working again... I have no idea what the issue is but beware. The wall switch is my backup switch, but I won't be able to take advantage of the 3 way switch if it fails."
4,Very nice lamps but......,"Okay, the lamps are very nice and simple, they are sturdy and for the price you can't go wrong. But, just to be honest I had a time getting the lamp out of the packaging box, not a big deal but they do a very good job packaging up the lamp for you to the point where I was getting a little aggravated trying to undo all the tape and packaging foam. The only other thing and it just may have been me is I had a bit of a hard time lining up the pole to screw the lamp into place. But other than that they really are very nice, they work well and you get what you pay for."
3,Great price---poor quality!,"This lamp was difficult to assemble. Mostly due to the poorly treaded ends where all sections connect for the lamps assembly.I believe due to poor quality of metal,these treaded ends acted like they wanted to cross-thread,but,they were just ""crumbling"" when being assembled. After much patience,once assembled,this lamp was working fine for about 3 months and the switch stripped out at the top of the lamp. Luckily,there is and in-line switch in the power cord midway between the base and the plug,BUT,cannot use the 3-way feature now though."
1,The floor lamp with poor design and cheap materials,"when I received this lamp, the package was already broken. The product was built with very cheap material and the power switch was very hard to turn. There was no screws for the torch part. I regretted that I bought this product."
5,Canadian Chocolate YUMM!!,I am Canadian and have been living in the US now almost 12 years...I get my family to bring me Dairy Milk chocolate bars whenever possible. The US version of this chocolate bar does not even compare. There is a wax coating on the US version that almost prevents it from melting in your mouth..and IMHO what's the point of ingesting all these calories if you are not going to enjoy the taste of the melted chocolate in your mouth?? LOL...If you order these you will NOT be sorry!!
2,A Dog's Best Friend,"I bought these clippers thinking they were more durable than the ones I have been using. I have three dogs and they work fine with my little ones. I have a big dog however, and these clippers can barely cut through his nails. These clippers are not as sharp as I would have liked. They tend to fray and split the nails instead of cutting them. I would not purchase these again."
2,They fray the nail and leave a ragged & weak edge,"I have used these cutters on 3 different Vizslas and one New Mexico Special (Mut) and they continued to fray the nail when cut. Not sure why. I am looking for another cutter that gives a clean cut. BTW, I also have an electric nail grinder, the dogs hate it -- too noisy."
2,Disappointed,"I bought these clippers after i broke a cheap plastic pair. I have a German Shepherd and a cat. These didn't work for either. The clippers aren't sharp enough to make clean quick cuts on the dogs nails, and I thought i would still get some use out of them by using them on the cats nails, but they still wouldn't work. They just bent the cats nails and didn't really clip them at all. I wouldn't recommend these clippers to anyone looking for something sturdy or sharp, which is what i assume most people are looking for in nail clippers."
5,Priced right,My mom needed this for work looked on other sites and the cost was much higher. The product was in perfect shape and very helpful when it came time for her to test
1,Tissot Navigator T-Touch,"I liked my Nav 3000 a lot when I bought it in 2001 and found it to be very useful for INTL traveling. Traveling through time zones was a breeze with the Time Swap feature. Everything was rosy until the DST start end date changes began to fluctuate in 2007. Now my Tissot is an hour off for a week or two twice a year. With great effort, I followed the manual instructions to reset the start/end dates of DST in my time zone... to no avail. The Tissot does not recognize the new settings. That is a deal breaker for me so I would not buy another one. Other than the inaccurate time, it's a great piece of jewelry!:)"
5,A watch for travelers,"Great watch for traveller: not so difficult to parameter (even if not totally obvious), nice design (maybe a little bit thick). I appreciate to have the choice of the music which is going to wake me up..."
3,Nice watch,I bought this watch and the instruction manual was of no use. I called Tissot and they emailed a manual specifically for this watch. I spent 2 days trying to get it to work. I finally called Tissot and luckily there was a Tissot authorized service center in my area. I asked for help on setting the watch over the phone. The gentleman I spoke with said it was too hard to explain on the phone. I brought the watch down to him and he set it in about 15 minutes. I don't know how Tissot can sell a watch with such a poor instruction manual. I returned the watch to Amazon. They were excellent to deal with.
2,Tissot Navigator 3000,Very pretty clock and a goods features like two alarm programmables and dual time. It fells from a height of 2 feet and it was broken. I cant use the garantee in my country. The repair is most expensive that to buy a new one
1,Disappointing Amazon + Little understanding,"I bought this product,nearly USD 400 after saving alot and when i receive t,it DID NOT work .The box did not evn have the Instructions booklet .I returned it to Amazon, sent them about 4 emails to indicate that I would like another watch and NO REFUND but to just simply EXCHANGE it for another TISSOT and they DID NOT Understand it.Its really strange that AMAZON does not understand the basic law in commerce, I buy they sell..if something happéns exchange it for another product with same or higher value.The worse part is : Amazon messed up and they put their terms..really exasperating and frustrating, Hope they change their opinion, after all it is the Customer,s choice and money to choose where and what to buy especially if a Store messes up."
3,Works but limits options,I bought this because I put a lot of hours on my chainsaw and string trimmer. I get very hot (over heat) during the summer especially wearing safety gear to run a saw or string trimmer. I thought this would be great since it wouldn't fog up or get dripping wet like my safety glasses and let a breeze through. It is a bit flimsy and I found the coverage to be a bit awkward. It seems to get in the way and not provide the protection you might expect. The biggest mistake I made is I cannot use my ear muff hearing protection and have to revert to ear plugs. There is no way to let the muffs go over the strap. I prefer muffs for safety as I often need to be able to hear someone and taking plugs in and out gets old. Back to safety glasses and ear muffs for me. Hope this helps you decide.
4,Will never be shelved!,"Thanks to the Campanellas for their hard work. They have done a terrific job matching new photos to historical ones. Each photo has a detailed caption -- the Campanellas never leave the reader disoriented. A dry sense of humor comes through on occaision, making reading the book feel more like a friend telling you about a city he loves rather than reading a dull textbook. My only complaint is very little on mid-city and lakeview. Perhaps a post-Katrina edition will come out. Fantastic photos. This book will always be ready to read. I don't think it will ever find its way onto a bookshelf."
5,Spectacular Songs & Videos,"This Cd-Dvd package is worth every dollar you spend just alone for the video of the ballad, ""NUNCA TE OLVIDARE"", which is also included in a remix on the Cd.<<<What a spectacular song! Enrique's gift is that of Karen Carpenter's: he totally understands a lyric and is able to vocally and emotionally interpret and transform a ballad into a theatrical masterpiece! He can take any song, bring warmth and breathe life into its lyrics like so few other singers can...he captures the ultimate moment in any song he sings. I loved listening to his father's(Julio) music as a teen well before he recorded in English, but the master's son is the heir apparent to the throne of the ultimate balladeer. As with Frank Sinatra and Linda Ronstadt, ENRIQUE will conquer every category of music he explores throughout his career. He's a stellar vocalist! I'm so elated I'm bilingual...it does sound more beautiful in Spanish."
5,Wonderfully amazing!,"This album will definitely make you feel like you are walking in the streets of a Spain. It has the Spanish flavor that will touch your heart. Quizas is also a wondeful song because it is very personal, you almost feel like your reading Enrique's diary. Other great songs on the album are Marta and La chica de Ayer. Although Enrique has great English albums, there nothing like when he sings in Spanish. You won't regret this buy!"
5,i love this album,i think this album is excellent i think enrique iglesias did a very good job and it chould win album of the year the music is excellent and the sound of the album as well as the lyrics its reallly good and i think this album is as amazing and excellent as his previous albums and maybe even better ! i salute enrique for singing such music.
5,QUIZAS TO GREAT MUSIC,"THIS CD IS GREAT! TRACK 1, 6, 5 ARE THE BEST. THE DVD INCLUDED IN THIS CD IS GREAT ALSO. YOU CAN SEE SOME VIDEOS OF OLDER SONGS. ALL TRUE FAN MUST BUY! ALSO THERE IS A SONG ABOUT HIS DAD. GREAT SONG."
5,Lovin' this CD!,"Even if you only became an Enrique fan after hearing his English stuff and you are not familiar with his earlier albums, you are still going to love his latest cd. Although I am not fluent in spanish I bought this cd after seeing the video for ""Para que la Vida"" and I was not disappointed. I love the changing tempo of ""pienso en ti"" and the very 'dance-able' beat of ""la chica de ayer"". Marta is my favourite on this cd.The ballads are smooth, the dance songs are pulsing and Enrique's vocals are fabulous, he sounds even better in spanish than in English. This is one of the best albums I've bought this year. If you're an Enrique fan (regardless of your native tongue)BUY IT!!!"
3,Get the included DVD,"Honestly I thought I was going to get a spanish version of an english album, This is not the case. This album most resembles the last spanish album cosas de la vida. It is full of slooooooow ballads, no pop songs. The only pop song is the spanish version of turn off the lights. If you want this album get the one with the included dvd. That is worth it, not the cd."
5,Enrique Has done it again,"Hola buen dia, Para todo la gente latino que hay en el mundo,se tienen que comprar este cd. A mi personalmente me encanta todo las temas del cd.Now in english, i highly recommend this cd, all the songs a great, i really like the slow ones, but over all its a great cd. The Dvd is good too, its got some of his old hits, but its worth it. Great Job Enrique"
3,not great. but it's alright....,"Despite the lofty praises of the other reviewers, this album is not the second coming of the messiah. ok?I like Enrique's voice. and I like many of his songs. Quizas is decent and I especially like ""Mentiroso"". But let's be honest. He isn't ""the most talented modern male singer I've heard in years"" as one put it and this isn't ""definitely one of the best Spanish speaking albums out"" as another put it. ""Muchas Flores"" by Rosario is a much better album (for example)Luis Miguel, Jerry Rivera, Luis Fonsi. etc they all have better voices. Don't get me wrong. I like Enrique. But let's keep things real.also, I am glad that this is NOT an english album in spanish version. Why do norteamericanos all think that spanish albums by spanish artists are american songs sung in spanish? So no.. this is not like Ricky Martin's last album. (Thank God) If you appreciate latin music and not american pop i spanish, buy thi salbum. But don't expect this to be your reason for living."
1,QUIZAS NO.,"(...)i don't have nothing against Enrique, in fact i love his goods albums as ""Cosas del Amor"" ""Escape"" and ""Seven"" but...come on, this is maybe the worst cd i've ever heard and believe me, i hear a lot of music all day long."
1,Keep away from it,"The first thing I found out about this C.D. upon receiving it from Amazon.com and putting it on the player, was that no one of the eleven pieces listed on the back of the leaflet matches the ones actually sung. I had ordered this C.D., out of long-past memories, for piece #1 (Tres Palabras) and #5 (Quizàs), and both shine for their absence. The others I don&#65533;t know at all, I don&#65533;t care for and I guess I'll just chalk this episode up to experience, without even bothering to return the C.D.. At any rate, after having listened to the C.D. in the vain hope of finding something I had wanted, I really can&#65533;t understand what the previous raving reviews, 4 or 5 stars, are all about, considering Mr Iglesias jr&#65533;s thin and tinny vocal qualities."
1,you'll regret this,"at first it was ok2listen2,but it got old fast. he can't sing nor make music at all."
4,A good collection,"This CD contains a broad selection of Irish favorites with pleasing arrangements. What St. Patty's party is complete without a good sing-a-long, and this karaoke CD should start the crowd singing. It would have been better with a few more of the well-known ""pub"" songs."
2,"Kodak Premium Photo Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, Matte, 50 sheets (8621690)",Just a quick note: This Matte Photo paper doesn't look or feel anything like the Matte paper you get your prints on from a Store. Very disappointing.
1,DOA out of the box twice!,"Of the three computers that I tried this card in, none of them even recognized its existence, yet when I put the similar Netgear 802.11b PCMCIA card in the network came up instantly. So I sent it back and got another one and that one was dead too!I can only assume there's a bad batch of these cards out there, so I'd wait about 6 months before I looked at them again."
3,major problems mar a film that could be great,"Wajda's ""The Conductor"" could have potentially been a masterful examination of the nature of art and politics, but the film's weaknesses keep greatness at bay. It's about an aging Polish conductor who's made a name for himself abroad returning to his hometown to direct Beethoven's 9th with the local symphony at the request of a woman who claims to be his daughter. The conductor's command of the orchestra causes resentment in it's original (non-famous) leader, the conductor's daughter's husband. In its favor the film has some striking moments and the finale is beautiful and moving. It is also a deeply felt tribute to the healing power of music. The acting is great though John Gielgud is horrendously dubbed into Polish. The film's drawbacks are its obviousness and occasional pretentions and, well, Gielgud IS horrendously dubbed. Still worth a look."
2,Velcro (R) style Tape!,"I have two medium-large size dogs, a boxer and a pitbull mix.I was happy to find the comfort muzzle and it looked like a perfect solution but upon arrival I was very disappointed.It's just Velcro (R) style tape.There's no padding or fabric on the side which touches the dog, so the edges are sharp.Unless you fasten it very tightly, the dog can easily remove it but when you fasten it tightly, it's painful because of the sharp edges on the tape.The product should be improved with some sort of lining and perhaps a piece of elastic so that it may truly be a ""comfort muzzle"" -- as it is now, it's a torture muzzle."
2,Dog Muzzle,Muzzle does not work well for larger breed dogs. My german shepdards can pull them off in no time.It may work well for smaller dogs.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR ME, I HAVE 2 PIT BULLS AND THEY TOOK IT OFF WITHIN 3-5 SECONDS OF HAVING IT ON, WHAT A JOKE!! AT THE TIME I PAID 15.00 PER MUZZLE AND I FOUND ONE FOR 7.00 THAT WORKED PERFECT! WASTED MY 30.00, THEY KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF SENDING IT BACK. I DON'T HAVE A RATING FOR THIS PRODUCT I HAD TO PUT A STAR TO LEAVE THE COMMENT."
4,Really Silly,Kids' Silliest JokesMy 4 year old started trying to tell jokes. Needless to say they weren't funny and didn't make sense. So I thought I would get a book of children's jokes for him to learn. Many of the jokes in this book go over his head. Maybe when he gets a little older he will get it. They are pretty silly. I'm pretty sure you will only laugh because it's your child telling the joke. But isn't that the kind of joke we all started out telling? Sure!
5,Joke books for Kids,"My grandson is nine years old and has expressed a desire to be a comedian, so I thought I'd support him by buying him a joke book. He liked it very much. I read it and thought it was perfectly appropriate for a young person his age. I'm glad I bought it. We are both enjoying memorizing the jokes and then springing them on the family."
5,Coffee lover,"This coffee has a taste like no other and I am pleased with my purchase.I know that administration costs have to be met. The coffee itself was not too expensive, but by the time it reaches my 'doorstep' it is. Unfortunately I am retired and 'cannot always buy the things I would like.I will buy some more, and due to what I have mentioned above, 'will not be on a regular basis."
2,Chilrens pierced hoop earrings,"Cute earrings, but alot smaller than what the picture leads you to believe. I would not have bought them had there been a measurment description."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!,"These books called The Enforcers are her best ever. Not only mystery but also romance Once you start reading you can""t put them down. Well worth the read."
4,Beautifully done,An interesting glimpse into a culture that knows how to live with death as part of life. Beautifully and sensitively filmed. I definitely recommend it.
3,Interesting but slightly disturbing,"I didn't enjoy seeing the dead being handled. I wasn't expecting that. It was interesting, except for that. I can't seem to get that nauseating feeling from my belly when I think of this cd."
2,Works in a straight line,"While this product works as advertised, I'll be returning it today. The problem is that there must be a DIRECT line-of-sight connection between the wireless access point and the wireless adapter. I couldn't make a connection if I was one room away, or sometimes even if there was a screen door and 15 feet between my notebook and the wireless access point. Forget using it on another floor of your house or out in the yard. If you can't see the antenna on the base unit your laptop will not be able to connect."
1,Lots of Colton... Very Little Albert Lee,"If you're a big fan of guitarest Albert Lee, and if that your primary reason for knowing about and liking Heads Hands and Feet, you will be VERY disappointed in the ""Home From Home"" album. If, on the other hand, your a fan of Tony Colton or with Heads Hands and Feet aside from all of Albert Lee's talents, then this is a ""must-have"" album. The point is that on this album, Albert Lee's guitar can only be heard on a couple of tracks. I think that I've only identified one song where he has a lead of any significance (""Can You See Me""). Each of the three ""known"" Heads Hands and Feet albums are FULL of Albert."
2,Lacking,"The music is generally from later seasons and lacks a lot of the meat of the series. There are songs referencing Gus Pike and Felicity, yet none of the beautiful sea music that always accompanied Gus's scenes are on it. This is most likely because they are actual sea shanties and not composed for the series. The title music is also not there. There should have been major themes for ALL the characters and not clips from the tv shows.....I would love to know where to find all of Gus's music."
5,After the scriptures... this is the most important book!,"Jesus the Christ is one of my most favorite books. It is well written and helps the reader understand the only Begotten Of The Father. It is the mission of Christ in Pre-mortality, Mortality and for all eternity. It helps you understand the person and furthermore helps you build a closer relationship with Our Savior. I cannot say more about that book, except I know it to be true and every word touches my heart each time that I read it. I have three copies... one big one with art, one leather bound for daily reading and one paperbound that I have marked up like crazy."
5,Factful and uplifting,Great book!! Full of facts that are substantiated. Very detailed and informative. Increases ones testimony of the Saviour and his gospel. A great study aid as well.
5,My 13 year old daughter,My 13 yr old daughter loves this product! She was having some trouble with hormonal acne and started using epiduo which is working so well! So she tried this product to cover any redness she was having and it never clogged her pores and blended so nicely! She is so disappointed that this product in no longer available! She is so sad! Her color was neutral 03 and we can't find that shade anywhere on line even though you can still find some of the other shades! Very Sad!
5,Almay Skin Stays Clean!,"Almay's Skin Stays Clean Makeup is my favorite. It goes on so naturally smooth and stays fresh looking all day. I love the way it covers without looking like a heavy, cakey mess. It looks and feels light and lets your skin breathe."
5,wow,"I am a big civil war collector.. i have bought movies,doctumentaries,a watch a wallet a lamp a pillow a blanket and a 150 year commemorative plaque......"
4,"So far, so good","Just used these products on my 3 year old vehicle and she is shining bright. Almost looks like a new car!! Per the instructions, I will reapply the polish in 30 days in hopes to seal in a great shine that will last all year round."
3,A Constant Rant,"While I enjoyed the way Bly writes in this book on creative non-fiction, I didn't find it to be of much help. She constantly points out the ""dumbing down"" of American society and the lack of care taken when teaching creative writing. Her rants belittle the reader, acting as if the reader doesn't know the horrors in education or in America. I agree with her on both points, but I feel as though she never gives a solution. While it did spark a little inspiration in me, it wasn't a good read. I suppose if that was her point in writing this book, then she succeeded, but it was dull and lacked innovation."
1,Everything I needed to know,"True story: The first thing that my eye caught on in this book was on page 4 where she said that Americans had ""dumbed down,"" but the exception was a few thousand English majors and writing students. How wonderful that the author falls into that group. Flipping ahead I stopped on page 22 and read ""There are so many things I despise about the Roman Catholic Church--its on-going authoritarianism and its history of torturing people--that it is hard for me to be fair."" I am not Catholic myself, but I cannot help think this book is a most unusual and creative forum for that particular breed of writing.It is a rare writer who in two or three sentences can tell me EVERYTHING I want to know from her. Ms. Carol Bly is one such rare writer."
5,A kindred spirit,"This is the first book on Christian apologetics that I have read in a long time that feels like it is written by a true thinker and hasn't made me feel slightly nauseated. At first I thought he was going over the same ground as C.S. Lewis does in the book ""Mere Christianity"", since it starts the same way about how humans have an in-built longing for justice and beauty (and where did that come from??) - but he moves on from there to Jesus himself and the kingdom that Jesus kept on talking about ... I strongly recommend this book for any thinking person who is thinking about God.After finishing this book - I would recommend rereading the book of Matthew - maybe with William Barclay's easy to read commentary, which also sends shivers down the spine in its insights into Jesus."
4,Great Read,"Would have given it a 5, because of the truth (for the most part), the way it is written, and the fact like soothing music to the hears, Simply Christian is for the soul...However, the chapter entitled 'Worship' was not about theological belief but instead it was a chapter written with his preference on worship. He even makes mention to his traditions. Which again, isn't bad, we all like what we like, but the rest of the book seems to be written out of the beauty, truth, and reality of God...but don't let one chapter stop you from reading this book--It is a must!"
5,Home Run for N.T.!,"It seems many times I'm only reading material that reinforces what I already know. This book went beyond that educational rut. It gave fresh language to what I really believe and then took me places where I could see my faith from totally new perspectives. I grew deeper in knowledge and more passionate in love with God through it. Thanks.E. SANDRAS, author of ""Buck Naked Faith"" and ""Plastic Jesus"""
4,"solid writing, solid thinking","N. T. Wright ably represents mainline Christianity in this 21st century restatement of the basic, essential and commonly held tenets of the Christian faith. Unlike most current Christian best sellers he doesn't shy away from a commitment to social justice, and he emphasizes the importance of the faith journey as a communal endeavor instead of just ""me and Jesus."" It is a needed corrective to much of the drivel that has passed for Christain writing in the post C. S. Lewis era.While the Lewis comparisons are a bit of a stretch with regard to writing style and communication ability, he does a great job of bringing the best of current Christian thought to the popular reader. Highly recommend."
3,It's that simple?,"If this guy has such a wonderful ability to explain the complex simply, why don't the reviewers manage to say what his main point is?"
1,A brilliant but meanspirited mind,"N.T. Wright is a powerful thinker, and he succeeds in framing orthodox evangelical Christianity in a way that makes it more accessible to postmodern seekers. However, his arguments are drenched in a kind of meanspiritedness and intolerance of other perspectives that makes it difficult to detect a truly Christian voice. Further, Wright makes constant use of an unconvincing rhetorical style: ""Let's face it. We all know what the real story is; all this pretending that there are two potentially viable ways of looking at things is really just pretending. We all know the truth ... and it just happens to be what I believe in."""
4,Thoughtful Theology,"I am a big fan of N.T. Wright. So when I saw this book, I had to purchase it. However, I found the opening chapter a bit dry and frankly, put the book aside for sometime. But now, giving it a second chance and plowing past the first 50 pages, I have found this work fascinating. N.T. Wright is at his best when he draws together his vast biblical knowledge into a simple message that explains the development of the Christian faith. His description of God and his apology for Christianity is excellent. He does a marvelous job explaining why the Hebrew Scriptures are relevant to the New Testament. This one is worth the time and will enlighten your understanding of Christianity. This is great for those exploring Christianity for the first time or for the life long Christian in need of deeper knowledge of the Christian faith."
4,An Echo of the Still Small Voice,"N. T. Wright entices readers to listen to the still small voice in their soul speaking of justice, spirituality, relationships, and beauty. His premise emphasizes that these four voices have simply one logical uncaused cause: God who created us in His image. Wright introduces these voices in section one, explains them further in section two, then discusses their implications in section three. While not an easy read, readers with a philosophical bent will be challenged to reconsider the nature of the soul and Who that nature points toward.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , Soul Physicians, andSpiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care And Spiritual Direction."
4,Simply Christian by N.T. Wright,We are using this for a book group. Plus the fact that we have met N.T. Wright makes it very special. He is a good writer and a very nice man.
2,Review,"I was asked to review this book as a possible study book for my church. Although the writer does make a few good points, I don't think that it is interesting enough to encourage our members to be a part of the study group. Not what I expected."
2,The Not so Simple wit of NT Wright....,"Prof. Wright proceeds by analogy, by simile, by imagery - and then swoops from there to take his argument further, while you're still marveling at his wit, but perhaps not so willing to share his conclusions. Oh well. He's probably a better Christian than I am, anyway. Life, huh?Simply Christian"
4,Wright is always a good choice,"The book is good, as is characteristic of N.T. Wright. I have to admit, though, that I didn't find it as enjoyable as Surprised by Hope. Still, overall a very enjoyable read, a great option for recommended reading to any laypeople who are interested in thinking further about the meaning of Christianity.My only real negative comment to make is that I think his treatment of homosexuality in the book was somewhat shallow and stretched (it was brief though, it's not the main theme of the book by any means). He makes great comments on sexuality in general but his remarks on homosexuality seemed to be making stereotypes or relying on them.For many Christians, that would not be negative at all."
3,No C. S. Lewis,"I've seen Wright's name popping up in relation to Lewis, including on the book jacket, and I really wanted to like this book, but found his writing to be pretty bland. The content is fine - especially his emphasis on social justice which sets him apart from many evangelicals and his description of the atonement. His theology is nuanced and thoughtful as he walks the middle way of Anglicanism. That, for me, was the only similarity to Lewis, who was much more creative in his use of metaphor and argument. I'd still give ""Mere Christianity"" to my friends over ""Simply Christian."""
5,Consider this book - you won't regret it,"We are in the middle of a small group study of the women described in this book. Not only is the book wonderful by itself, but to meet and discuss and share it in a small group setting is incredible. Vickey does a wonderful job of making you look twice at familiar stories and to learn from them, and to leave a changed person."
5,WOW!,"I started reading Elfquest about 9 months ago, but unfortunatly, I had never read the first one, so I was kinda lost. But finally, I discovered Fire anf Flight at the library and picked it up. It is definatly one of the BEST books I ever read (if there were any better ones, they were probably Elfquest books too, though). The artwork and storyline are, rated out of ten, and eleven. If you want to know HOW good it is, good pick up a copy for yourself."
5,Excellent.,"When I first bought this book I was a little reluctant to read it and be happy with what I read. After a few pages I found myself saying, ""Man, these people are good."" I recomend this to everyone who likes Fantasy/Sci-Fi."
4,The long awaited follow up to a masterpiece,"First of all, Demigod are Death Metal legends before this even came out. Most of the band that played on ""Slumber of Sullen Eyes"" left and formed ""Adramelech"" so I believe only two are left. For me being a Demigod fan I would say this isnt exactly death metal but has its momments where you can hear old reminders. If they just released this under a different band name they might have had something. I have really grown away from standard metal but have to say this album is pretty good from start to finish if your not looking for the Death Metal Demigod. I enjoy this album & even the last album ""Let Chaos Prevail"" but I still hear old Demigod in there somewhere. Like I said I am a fan. If you want another Demigod sound check out Adramelech also."
2,Average,"I think Chante Moore is a Real Good Singer&that Kenny Lattimore is Good but the Chemistry of there Vocals Here feels like Tom Crusie&Nicole Kidmen's Film""Eye's Wide Shut"" there but so far away&cold.this feels like a Forced Musical Union."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Kenny Lattimore and Chanté Moore - Things That Lovers Do (Arista, 2003)Lattimore and Moore have more in common than you think. Their last solo albums, Weekend and Exposed, respectively, were weak attempts at mainstream products. They now got married and got together for this album of remakes. There are only two originals, ""Lovable"" and the title track, but the remakes are stronger than those two tracks. While it's questionable why they remade ""Still"" and they should have left ""Make It Last Forever"" alone, they did breathe new life into Clint Black's ""When I Said I Do"". Also, the slower grind to Teddy Pendergrass' ""Close the Door"" is very appealing. The note at the back of the CD, ""Warning: This project may cause pregnancy"", adds a little bit of cheesiness to the album so if you want a better duet album, check out Kindred the Family Soul's Surrender to Love. -EJR"
2,A Disappointment - Let's get original.,Anybody cannot do a remake. They would have been better off with original material. It was a disappointment. Listening to the CD left you wanting to hear the original. I would not waste my money or time. Hopefully we can hear beautiful music from the duo in the future that is original and fresh with their own original touch. Chante is such a talent and Kenny is not bad so let's put your talent to work.
5,Sheer Excellence,"This is the most soulful, romantic cd that I've heard in a long time. Chante and Kenny's voices blend beautifully in the melody of love. These talented artists are in top form."
5,I Can Listen To This All Day!!!!,"In ""Things That Lovers Do"", Kenny and Chante really shine as a couple in love who wants to share that love to the rest of the world. This CD is absolutely beautiful! I love every song on here which is odd for me. Generally, I don't like the way contemporary artists take songs that were originally done by legendary artists and give it a new sound. But Chante and Kenny does it in excellent fashion. This CD of them together is better than any recording that they've released separately as solo artists. Cuts 7 and 8 are my favorites, but there's not a single song on here that I don't like. I hope that this is the start of a long line of duet albums by this hot couple. Buy this and I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,True Lattimore fans: STAY AWAY!,"Outside of track 8 (excellent) & track 2 (good) this was a major waste of time & money. Kenny Lattimore is top 3 of all current R&B artists & has an incredible voice & sound. I guess I've been spoiled by his first 2 releases that were excellent & turned me into a big fan. Kenny's 3rd alblum maybe led into the weakness of this one, which was also a big disappointment. The man can sing like no other; new songwriters/producers are desperately needed for him or he will quickly fade back to obscurity. With the 100's of cover's they could have done; Truly (Lionell Ritchie)& the Billy Preston/Syreeta remake?? Horrible. Visionary, creative help is now needed for Kenny's career. What a shame. Incredible talent & potential."
5,"Beautiful, Real and Wholesome!!!!","Things that Lovers Do is a musical masterpiece. Although the album mainly features covers of musical hits, it is especially wonderful to hear two contemporary vocalists that are able to do the songs just as good, and even better. My favorites are ""With You I'm Born Again,"" and ""Here We Go."" On these the real-life couple demonstrate their affection for one another and Chante Moore delivers with the same finesse and range as her musical mentor, Minnie Riperton, also proving that Mariah Carey is not the only one around with an ultrasonic range.On top of that, the music is genuine and supported by a beautiful accompaniment of instruments, instead of the synthesized beats that you'd find in Usher, Beyonce and other ""superstars"" of today.Do yourself a favor and purchase this CD. If you need more proof, see Kenny and Chante live on television or in concert. You will not regret it!!!"
4,A labour of love,"Things that Lovers Do is clearly a labour of love with real-life couple Kenny Lattimore and Chante Moore re-interpretating slow jams and ballads with slick production. From the opening flirtatious number ""Things that Lovers Do"" produced by James Harris and Terry Lewis, Moore and Lattimore segues nicely into emotional opus ""With you I'm Born Again"" and Babyface's classic ""Love Saw It"", brilliantly blending their husky vocals and impressive range to sublime effect. Other highlights include the hot single ""Loveable(from your head to your toes)"", a beautiful rendition of Lionel Richie's ""Still"" and the schmaltzy ""You Don't Have To Cry Anymore"" that showcases the different aspects of love. All the twelve songs here may not elicit immediate attraction but they will grow on you. Love is exactly like that."
3,GREAT CD but still.........,"No doubt about it, both Kenny Lattimore and Chanté Moore are great singers and this CD provides great soul music but to label it ""Warning! This project me cause pregnancy"" is somewhat of an exaggeration in my opinion.If I was to seduce someone I cared mightily about, I would much much rather put on Will Downing and Gerald Albright's joined 1998-release ""Pleasures of the Night"". Not only the album title but the trax are MAGNIFICENT and GUARANTEED to put you in that special mood..............."
5,"""Off the Hook""","This CD is awesome. It's good for the bedroom, or for the ride on long trips. I can see myself listening to this one over and over. Even though there are a lot of remakes on this CD, it is still worth the money. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!"
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun","Ms. Marriott does a wonderful job with ""Way out West."" This contemporary romance set in a fantasy old west setting if fun from beginning to end. If you like romance, you'll love ""Way out West."" I did!"
3,You Never Can Tell,"I did not care for this book. I expected it to follow the story line of the first book in the series, which I loved. However, this one was too detailed into the Indian way of life and it seemed to drag on and on. I skipped over a lot of it--and that's unusual for me."
3,Didn't Capture My Interest,"Way Out West didn't capture my interest as it did other readers. My emotions weren't engaged by the storyline, it seemed rather silly to me."
4,negima- disc 5,"this series is different and funny, and at times can be really cute. my order came quick and in great condition. now i own all 5 discs."
3,A good reference,"I'm not exactly sure what i expected of this book. I was hoping it would recount the stories of the earlier generations of the House of Atreus in more detail then i'd seen them before. Johnston's book does do this, but it's more of a breeze over in the beginning to get to the more well known story of Agamemnon, Electra etc. It seems to go from a reference to a novel suddenly and without warning. It skips over some details that i truely wish it hadn't, and at the end Electra (who's view most of the story takes place in) is left hanging when suddenly she is of the picture as Orestes'view takes over when he wanders after killing his mother.The book has it's good points and bad points, but i'd recommend it most as a reference to the family tree."
5,A generation of mis-readers,"""Research-based"" has become code for ""direct-instruction"", ""phonics only"", and ""NICHD/Reid Lyon-supported"". In Coles' important book, this research is carefully and responsibly examined and discredited. A must for everyone who, in good conscience, is standing up to this recent wave of (as Frank Smith has said) reading nonsense."
1,Coles Misreads Reading Research,"The book should be entitled ""misreading reading research."" There have been great advances in the past three decades in understanding how better to teach children to read, with much of the work being very good science that decidedly is helping children and has the potential to help many more children if more widely applied. Every page of Coles' book contains at least one assertion that is at a minimum debatable. I gave this a 1-star rating only because zero stars was not an option."
4,Face your life!,"The message is clear -- face the issues that are stressful for you. I enjoyed this book because it is realistic. If you have problems with stress, this book will help you."
1,How and Why is This Rip-Off of a Book Used For College?,"How is this $170+, barely 200 page, laughably outdated book (based on websites that mostly don't exist anymore and technology that's over 12 years old, ""since 2000"") the preferred choice for education technology in college courses? Somebody's getting a cut out of a deal designed to ""force"" a big payoff. I've purchased much more up-to-date and informative books about technology for under $80 (new) and are well over 300 pages. Out my many years of attending college level courses, this has been the biggest rip-off, in terms of textbooks, that I have ever encountered.Thankfully, I found a new copy of this book on Amazon for under $60; although it showed up on the last day of the predicted delivery, the condition of the book is just as described, ""new"".For the fact that this book is such a rip-off, by its default price, it gets only one star from me. Please tell your college professors to get a better book for their courses."
5,How to make sixty different holiday craft projects,"In Get Crafty: 60 Cool Holiday Crafts, Nancy Jo King shows young do-it-yourselfers how to make sixty different holiday craft projects for all the seasonal holidays including Christmas, Halloween, Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, and the Fourth of July. Ranging from unique jewelry and ornaments to homemade gift wrap and stationary, the crafts are fun, creative, and easy to make. Whether working individually or as a group project, Get Crafty: 60 Cool Holiday Crafts will offer hours and hours of safe, inexpensive, and creative entertainment."
2,"Not for quick, more experienced knitters","I am using these right now with a wool-blend yarn (NaturallyCaron.com Country) and cannot stand these needles. The needles are very ""sticky,"" making the yarn squeak. In addition to that, whenever I need to move my stitches over to an end, it takes some effort, which usually results in very sore, severely poked fingers. Using these needles more than tripled the amount of time to complete my project (fingerless mitts).These needles may work better with a silkier, non-wool blend yarn. They are also probably best for those knitters new to dpns, since it's extremely unlikely that any stitches will drop off. If you're experienced with dpns, pass these by...there's a reason why these were 75% off at my local crafts store."
4,Gets the job done,"This is clearly not something a professional watch repairman would use, but if you have one or two watches that you need to open a couple times a year to change batteries, this will get it done."
4,"Fun reading, some much better than others","The curse of the electronic age, SPAM eventually forces its way into the life of anyone with an email address. While there are many books and articles about how to reduce this problem, Jonathan Lund has taken his own personal war back to the spammers. Instead of just deleting the emails he responds to them.

2,bring back the old books!,Can't Francine Pascal and Laurie Jhon see how boring the series are getting? Theres no more exitment. What happened to Liz? I mean she used to be so dependable. And Jessica. whoa! She's supposed to be the one bringing exitment into the books! But now shes way too bussy being responsible to pull some crazy stunts like she did the year before. They don't even mension the old charchters anymore. And I think Liz and Tom should be together rather than Liz and Sam or Liz and Finn! The new books are well just getting plain boring!
1,no good!,I did'nt like this product at all.Going by the description of the manufacturer I had hopes but was disappointed.The mask is uncomfortable to begin with and gets more uncomfortable after a while cos the straps start digging in.The 'adjustable' elastic straps dont have much room for adjustment.
3,this one isn't too nice,It works but it doesn't feel quite comfortable. I would add several dollars more next time to buy a softer one.
1,No good...,I also found this product uncomfortable. It's inelastic and feels too firm against your face.
4,Sleep Mask,This mask works really well. My husband stays up later than I do and the glare from the computer used to keep me awake. This blocks out all of the intrusive light. It's comfortable to wear once you adjust it properly. It may take a couple of nights to get it to fit like you want it.
1,This mask sucks!,The mask is as hard as rock and the elastic straps are so tight you'll feel like they're try to stop your blood flow. Who with any common sense makes this mask!?!? I've used one-dollar masks that are better.
5,Must have plant book,"If you're into growing indoor plants this book must be in your library for both information on varieties as well as cultural information. I consider myself very knowledgeable gardner, yet find myself researching things in this book often--especially when adding a new plant species. I'd highly recommend it to anyone whether they had a few plants or a greenhouse full."
3,Best as a beach or bathtub read,"I wanted to read something by Jane Asher because I love her as an actress. While this had some interesting twists and turns, and it's not badly written, it's certainly not a great read either. When I read descriptions of this as a ""psychological"" thriller, I was hoping for something in the Val McDermid or Ruth Rendell genre. But in fact, it's more of a twisted romance. Angry people hellbent on revenge, that sort of thing. A fun read, but not a keeper."
1,Anti-aging? Not so much.,"I was hopeful about this product. Oil of Olay has been pretty good for me over the years. But I agree with some of the other reviewers. Far from ""filling out lines"" and moisturizing my lips, this product has actually dried out my lips (a lot!) and done nothing for lines. Don't get how Olay can make these claims, because I see zero of the results they promise. A very expensive, very disappointing product."
2,another rip off,"i would not recommend this product, it doesn't do what it says it will do. Save your $$ don't buy"
2,lip treatment,product is no different then putting chap stick on your face! It does nothing. I should have requested a refund.
2,hasn't done what promised,ever searching for the product that will work. this one hasn't yet. I'll give it longer then the promised 2 weeks and see what happens
5,best lip,this is by far the best lip moisturizer I have ever used! I love just about every product olay makes.
4,"Love It, But Does Not Last Long","First time purchasing this product, & MUCH cheaper here, compared to stores, where you will pay close to $20-$23. I have been trying for the last year to find a lib balm that actually works, & this does. As far as getting rid of fine lines, I have not noticed a difference, but did not have many to begin with. But, as far as moisturizing goes, it is great. My lips stopped cracking, peeling, and feeling sore all the time. The only downside, is it does not last long at all. I have had it for about 3 weeks, & it is almost gone(and I stopped using it 3-4 times a day & cut back to 1-2/day after I noticed how little actually comes in the tube). It actually stays on the majority of the night, & I don't wake up with dry lips.. it's actually still on my lips."
2,Lip Treatment,"I saw no improvement or any difference as in before and after use I would purchase this again, nor would I recommend"
3,Didn't see much,I was hoping the lip treatment will minimize the lines on my lip but I don't really see it improved. Could be just me. But I won't get it again.
2,Not a fan of the Olay Lip Treatment,"Overall, I'm a dedicated Olay product user. I love how their night creams moisturize my skin and cleansers/exfoliators remove dead skin and makeup. When I purchased the anti-aging lip treatment, my hope was to have more nourished lips but that really didn't happen, even after months of regular use. The product glides on smoothly and doesn't have any scent or flavor, but it felt waxy and heavy on my lips, like I was wearing a thick lipstick. The result wasn't anything better than using plain Chapstick, very disappointing.I've read that this product may help reduce the appearance of fine lines around the mouth, so perhaps it would work better with someone who has more aged skin than mine, but I really didn't notice any change on or around my lips."
3,Wish they would lower the price!,"I've used this product for several years, and it does a good job. However, I do not believe the results justify the excessive price that is charged."
1,Never got it,"Well I never got the item, but I was refunded the money without having to contact them."
5,soft & smooth lips,"Easy to use and no mess. Goes on easily, no slick or sticky feel yet it looks natural and w/ a slight shine. My lips appear fuller and I'm impressed w/ the results that I've had in the past 2 weeks of use. This will definetly be part of my routine from now on. Fine product."
4,"good stuff, yet expensive.","I wish this product was about $10 cheaper. I've been using this lip treatment for almost 3 weeks and I really like it. I haven't seen a huge improvement, but my normally dry lips are definitely more moisturized. I usually put this on after my facial routine right before bed... and whenever else I can think to put it on. I think it also makes a nice gift to give someone who's into these type of products. It's pricey, but nice."
4,Self,I think it's a good product. I've tried others and this is the best that I've tried of this type of product
2,Not worth the money,"I'm a loyal Olay user and it's the only brand of products I use for skin care...so I was excited to see this lip product come out. I was disappointed after using it, it cakes up and leaves that white line on your inner lip and in the corner of your mouth. I haven't noticed any difference in using it and it doesn't moisturize any better than your typical chapstick would. I won't be buying it again, it's very very overpriced and not worth it."
3,Cuisinart Griddler cleans easier,"Okay for the money but the heating plates don't come out but I got the ""Cuisinart Griddler"" $ 129.00it is much easier to clean"
5,Italians know their stuff,"We recently moved, and this was one of our first purchases once in the new house. This gadget saved my sanity because the difference between a typical sandwich and a panini is like night and day. A great purchase for the money!"
2,not thrilled,"I bought this to make grilled sandwiches which usually include cheese, right?This panini maker does not adjust the rear side of the sand., therefore, the back is cooked more that the front, because the back presses harder/deeper than the front, causing the cheese to leak out all over the place.It is easy to clean up and the sandwich did taste good, not evenly cooked and looked bad.I am returning it to get one that has a back end that is adjustable."
4,Very nice panini press. Wish it had an on/off switch,"This unit is very easy to use, cleans up easily, heats up quickly, cooks evenly, and has a very solid build quality; however, just one thing missing - an on / off switch. Without that, you have to unplug the unit when you're done using it. A fairly obvious oversight for any appliance. Would have rated it a 5, if it weren't for this issue."
3,De'Longhi Panini Press,"I bought this press because I didn't want to spend alot of money, I have so many other kitchen appliances that I only use occasionally. Most presses are $100. or more, this one is a name brand and under $50. The things I do not like about it are the plates are not detachable so you always have grill marks. If using a softer bread, like plain white, to make a grilled cheese, it sort of really presses it without much pressure. It also gets very hot on most of the outside surfaces, so user must be extra careful when using."
4,neat !,"its good grill but it doesn't have off and on button ,you have to unplug it to turn it off . other than that its neat and i'm expecting to last very long"
4,makes good panini,"Pros: Nice and heavy, easy to clean, heats up quickly, no chemical odors, can be stored up rightCons:I wished it had a power button on the device itself"
5,retrow panini grill,"In past purchases Ive bought Geo Forman grills,but this time around I decided on a DeLonghi grill after looking at the specs.I dont normally write about things I buy, but this piece of equip Im totally happy with.Its a fine grilling machine,Its well worth my time spent finding it.I would recomend it to anyone in need of a grill.It works well as well as good looking.A nice improvment in the kitchen. Ed Tesar"
2,"Bad for Panini, OK for hamburgers","I was looking for .... a panini maker, for top and bottom hot plates to make plate-grilled sandwiches. The problem with this item is that its grill plates have DEEP ridges, so instead of a toasted sandwich what you get looks like a deeply ridged toasted waffle. Or you get destroyed bread. This is sounds trivial, but the things are ugly and unaesthetic. Definitely not the panini of my youth.If I were buying again I'd get anImusa Cuban Sandwich MakerThis machine IS a good buy if what you're after is a retro looking George Foreman hamburger grill. It's got deep ridges in the top and bottom plates, which leave nice looking faux-grill marks on hamburger and steaks.But if what you're hoping for is food that tastes grilled and has the texture of grilled, remember this is not really a grill. It's a hot plate with ridges. Spiral sliced ham, for eg, ends up charred at the ""grill"" lines and warmish and soggy in between."
1,Too cool to use!,"I just purchased this grill for my wife for Christmas and wish I hadn't. I had read all the reviews an thought this was the best choice on the market, but due to some flaws it was not.The Good: The grill itself is good looking.The Bad: The controls were cheesy plastic. I could have lived with this, but the grill would not heat up enough to grill the pannini, which it is supposed to do. Luke warm is the best it could do.Perhaps it is defective, either way I am returning this grill."
1,Disappointing product,"This grill does not make a good panini. There is not enough pressure on the upper grill, and it does not make those distinctive panini stripes."
5,Panini Grill,This is a fabulous product and makes a great gift. It comes with a recipe book yet you can invent your own . Yummy.De'Longhi CGH800 Retro Panini Grill
5,Love this Pinani Grill,"I have cooked about everything on this - it's great for chicken, but you have to set your timer cause it cooks on both sides therefore it cooks quick...And it Will dry out if over cooked.....Love burgers, zucchini, pork chops, pork loin..... eggplant parm - no oil....Oh yeah......I was on a kick for a while and i think i cooked everyday for 2 weeks on this.....You can't go wrong with this grill....Clean up is easy.."
4,Extraordinary - Excelent!,"I love this DeLonghi Panini. I use it just to make sandwich not meats. Also I grill vegetables like red peppers, yellow peppers, green peppers, orange peppers, zuchinnis, mushroms, and eggplant, and use all of that ingredients to make a grilled vegetable sandwich! You will love it!"
4,Whats a Panini ?,"This is the first question my husband asked me when I pulled out the grill when it arrived. My kids absolutely love them, the hubbie is coming round to them. One thing I love about this is that is feels sturdy, is easy to clean, and makes great bread for bruschetta (excuse spelling). I use a bread I find locally which is a Rosemary Olive Oil bread and it is terrific on the grill. Be cautious on the amount of cheese you use, it will ooze, but is easy to clean up afterwards."
4,Just the ticket,"Big enough, adjustable temperature, and solidly built. We just use it for grilling sandwiches, but it takes everything from sliced bread to bagles and french bread without problem. You can turn the temperature down on the thicker sandwiches so the inside cooks before the outside burns.We haven't owned it long enough to comment on its durability, but it feels very solid. The clasp to keep the grill closed for carrying is a nice touch. It's not commercial quality, but it's also not commercial price. A very good buy."
1,Non Stick wears off fast!,Worked good for about a month and then the non-stick surface began to wear off. Even burgers stick to it now. Do not recommend.
4,Not bad for a panini grill,"Heats up fairly quickly, like having temperature control and overall does a good job for its intended usage. So far I have cooked bacon, grilled steaks and of course panini sandwiches and all uniformly grilled to perfection. Like other reviews posted, much of oil remains on grill surface and not flowing into drip cup. The only method I found around that is after grilling, I put it in lock position and gently tilt grill on its side for the remaining oil to flow into drip cup. Then it's fairly easy cleanup. Previously I had a Wolfgang large panini-maker and loved it very much, but that model is no longer available. None appear to last more than a couple years when their heating elements stop functioning. So you buy another one. Quite honestly, both panini grill and Wolfgang Bristol rice cooker, I have found very useful tools and stepsavers in cooking/grilling most anything. Won't be without either small appliance in my kitchen."
4,DeLonghi Panini Grill,"Works well, cleans easily. Grooves are wide-spaced, so if you want more grill marks, then go another route. The wide spacing definitely helps make clean up easier, so to me well worth fewer grill marks. Works best with artisan breads (or thicker sliced breads). Ordinary white sandwich bread works -- but you get some breakage/spill-over. I have used it for paninis and for grilling meat. My kids can easily grill hotdogs on it, etc. In fact, my children can safely ""cook"" on the grill (youngest is age 10). It's a great time saver on busy nights."
4,DURABLE IN TOUGH CONDITIONS,"I bought this for my apartment here at college, fully aware that it was probably going to take a beating. The non-stick works great which is awesome for easy cleaning. We've cooked everything from salmon to quesadillas on it with no problems."
5,my new favorite kitchen gadget,"I love this grill. I like the way it looks, cooks, plus it is easy to clean. The fact that it doesn't have an on/off switch is not problematic; I think it's safer that De Longhi designed the grill that way. I've bought several since my original purchase for friends!"
4,Me encanta mi panini grill...,"First panini grill I've owned. My in-laws have one and use it regularly --- that's why I decided to get one (plus the fabulous sale price). So far, I love it. We use it for paninis, grilled veggies or grilled sausages and veggie burgers. I am aware that there are more expensive panini grills out there, but this is highly recommended for first-timers and those not seeking a high-end professional one.This is also a very helpful gadget for those wanting to watch their calories."
3,"Okay, does not get hot enough",I wish this product could get hotter. It's also not easy to clean the top portion. Some crevices make cleaning a bit difficult. On a level surface it does not drain grease as well. I also wish it could open flat...The grill does have an acceptable cord storage and some means to adjust tmperature. The top portion swivels for self adjustments. Once on a counter it sits very steady and does not slide around. The power cord to heat the top element is protected by a metal spring-like attachment.
1,Broke after one day.,"Got the De'Longhi panini grill/press from our credit card rewards points. It came within a week. I set it up on the counter and the dial didn't work, It kept jumping around between low and high and would not hold the selection. However, the heat came on. I made some bacon, and then made some paninis. After that, it would not turn on any more. Something was rattling around inside. I tried several different outlets, just in case it was the outlet, but it would not turn on. I called De'Longhi and they offered to swap it out if I sent them the cut cord and a check for $15.00!!! $15.00 for just using it twice in one day!!!! I hope the one they send me works, or else I'll have to try another brand. What a rip off."
4,Every home needs a panini grill,"But not necessarily this one. I bought this grill from Amazon in March. I use it alot, and even considered giving it 5 stars, but I have a couple of issues with it.Compared to the other panini grills I have seen (Villaware, Krups, Wolfgang Puck), the DeLonghi has fewer, more widely spaced ribs. This design makes it easy to clean with a cloth, and no cleaning ""comb"" is provided. However, a drawback to the wide spacing is it can allow your panini to squish down into the valleys where all the oily stuff goes. You would be surprised how much oily goo a peperoni and mozzerella panini can make, especially if you brush the outside with olive oil, butter, or mayo before grilling like I do.A minor annoyance: when it is stored upright on its back, it teeter totters on the lid's power cord. IMO, a high end appliance shouldn't have such a glaring design flaw.Even though I like the DeLonghi alot, if I were buying another one, I would try the Villaware."
4,Great grill; one engineering problem,"I'm glad I had previously read a customer review explaining it has no on/off switch. Because an insurance adjuster had explained to me a long time ago that repeatedly pulling an electrical cord out of an outlet while the appliance is on ultimately causes house fires to start at that outlet, I went to Radio Shack and purchased a plug-in, dual on/off switch with outlets (about $7.00). The Radio Shack device's on/off switch lights up when the appliance is on, so you know whether you've turned it off. Otherwise, I love the appliance; my husband uses it frequently to make hot sandwiches, and it's easy to clean with a damp paper towel. Melted cheese turns crisp and comes right off the grill with no problems. It's a great product with multiple heat settings, a ""ready"" light to let you know when it's reached the desired heat, and my only complaint is that the engineer needs to be shot for not putting an on/off switch on the device."
2,Nonstick finish wearing off after only 8 uses,"It's attractive but that's about it. I've used it about 8 times since I received it as a Christmas gift and have been cleaning it as instructed, only using damp paper towels, and the nonstick finish is wearing off already. I also don't like seeing sparks at the outlet every time I unplug it."
2,no off button????,This grill is just ok I guess I did expect much more! One really strange thing is that it has no off button. You have to turn the knob all the way to the left in order to (turn it off) but it's still on there is no off button or a switch which make me very uneasy when I have to unplug it.Unless there is a diffrent way to turn it off but I read the instructions and it only says turn left to turn it off.Other then feeling getting shocked when unplugging it's not to bad.
4,nice grill,Super looking grill performs nicely with quick heat up and heavy solid construction. I just bought second one as a gift. They seem to be a hot seller too as they are constantly running out of stock. I saw the cuisinart at costco on display but it seemed cheesy and the lid was broken off. The lid on this grill is heavy as the job it is designed to do requires it. the only negatives are no power switch and the temp dial seems to be a little on the cheesy side. You can still vary the temp with it so it serves a good function. I do recommend this item heartily even with the minor negs.
4,Would be perfect if it got hotter,"For the price, this grill gets 5 stars. It cleans easily, heats quickly, has adjustable heat settings. I use it for french toast, grilled sausage, sandwiches and vegetables. To get a crisp sandwich, use some oil and leave in a little longer than you would normally for golden brown and set at highest temp. setting."
3,DeLonghi - Good for a beginner,I did not buy an expensive panini maker because I wasnt sure if I would like it or not. So far I love it. You definately need the top on a swivel hinge like this one has. Its fairly easy to clean although it would be great if the inside came out to clean in the sink. Overall a great purchase and I have used it alot.
5,Dang this thing is great!,"Not only is this grill a great panini sandwich maker, it also can be used like the George Foreman grill....to do chicken and other meats. In fact the George Forman Grill is tiny compared to this so we put it in the yard sale stuff. It has a large stick-free surface and is easy to clean. My wife has enjoyed making sandwich experiments and I have really enjoyed the eatng part. Just in case you wondered if the....""People who purchased this....also purchased that"" ads at the bottom of Amazon's check-out pages work....well they do."
1,The Pits,"This book is one of the most insanely idiotic things ever written. At no point during its rambling, incoherent waste of words did it come anywhere close to anything that could be considered a decent textbook. I am now dumber for having read it. I award it 1 star, and may God have mercy on the souls of its authors."
1,An absolutely horrible book,"As a student of physics, I have seen and read several introductory university physics texts, and I can say without a doubt that this book is the most difficult to understand and most poorly written. The text is full of equation derivations, which are somewhat interesting but completely useless to a student trying to learn the introductory concepts of physics to apply in his future engineering courses. The problems do not adequately serve their intended purpose of reinforcing the concepts. I emphatically do not recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn introductory concepts of physics."
1,not meant for learning physics,"I had the author of this book as my professor for Physics. We used this textbook and it was just really, a waste of our money. The textbook did nothing to help us learn physics in any way at all. It just confuses you more when the author takes the most complicated path to teach you a concept when it could be explained so much simpler. I had already taken a college-level physics class before this, and there are so many other better textbooks out there than this one. I have to say that they do have colorful and detailed illustrations which sometimes help, but the wording needs much help."
1,dear lord almighty,absolutely horrid...confusing...painful...makes me want to stop learning physics...this would be the alundra of video games in my opinion
1,Horrible,"This book does a very poor job of putting physics in context. It was convoluted and never really explained much. The author spent a lot of time deriving formulas and never telling you what use they were. After using this book I feel like I can explain a lot of mathematical concepts involving physics but can only apply small amounts of that to real world situations. It could have been much better organized as well, it splits uniform circular motion across several sections rather than just covering it in one."
2,"Easy examples, very difficult problems","I found this book very hard to understand. The examples given are very abstract, but then the problems sets are very difficult and hard to figure out."
1,Second to hell,This book is so hard to understand. The problems at the end of every chapter are totally not related to text and examples in the chapters. All in all the book is just un-understandable.
5,Combatting Urban Sprawl,"No one but Robert Freilich could maintain that the past 35 years of his life has been dedicated to combatting urban sprawl. When most of us hadn't graduated from law school, he was giving his own unique brand of ""thoughtful consideration"" to a critical issue which most communities had yet to recognize. Robert's book is an exceptionally informative volume, combining history of law, politics, and planning with a dash of autobiography. A great read!"
5,Positional Chess Clearly Explained,"This book should be read and enjoyed by any fan of Jeremy Silman's ""How To Reassess Your Chess"" and Michael Stean's ""Simple Chess."" All three books explain in clear, interesting prose those chess concepts we ""know"" but often fail to employ in our games. Love uses model grandmaster games to emphasize key concepts such as minority attacks, weak color complexes, closed games, etc. I think that intermediate players, say 1500-2000 USCF, are best-suited for this book since stronger players have probably mastered this info and less advanced players are still dealing with more tactical problems. However, it is a fun read regardless of your strength."
3,"not great, not bad","this is a documentary on Maserati rick, the detriot drug dealer from the 80's. didn't do that bad of a job on it. was not my cup of tea though."
4,Fun....,"I recently got this toy and I'ts making this weird grinding sound because the wheels are loose. I think it's kind of odd that the propellers only spin when the car is driving on the ground...but once it goes up in the air the propellers stop. Another thing i think is odd is that when you stretch out the car so that there is a back seat, there is no door for the back seat so the pollies might fall out. I enjoyed playing with this toy otherwise and enjoy the real car-like features and would recommend it to the people who think the same as me."
4,"Unusual for me, but very good.","This book was a new experience for me. I am used to ECO (Encyclopedia of Chess Openings) style for the structure of an opening book. Mr.Rowson has chosen a thematic structure so it demands more work to put the stuff in a ECO style way, but the matter is well presented and explained, and the author has a tremendous sens of humour. A real good book if you wish to understand this opening system, in harmony with the quality of The Gambit Publications."
4,Best Grunfeld Book on the market,"I am a LIFE-Master. I teach chess for a living. I have been playing tournamment chess since the late 60's. And the Grunfeld used to be my primary defense against the Queen's Pawn Opening. This is simply maybe the best book on the Grunfeld that is available today. Every line is covered. The analysis if of the highest quality. The writing is clear and concise and very easy to understand. You cannot go wrong getting this book. (Many good, complete and well-annotated games inside.)"
5,Magnificent Moles,"Music that is hard to classify in one distinction. Is it prog, jazz, pop, avant garde, classic rock etc. This album encapsulates all the kinds of music it can offer. So many time changes, variations, great instrumentation, songs and words that are vague but amusing. Magnificent, totally!!"
4,"Great if you have found him, otherwise good",This book was really good reading. I found that once I started it was hard to put it down. I took it most everywhere that I went. It gives some solid advice that friends cannot give. It goes great if you have regular sessions with a counsellor.
3,Doesn't really shine....,"Found this book to be a little bit annoying like most self-help books. The main message is that if you want intimacy you have to communicate your feelings with integrity. Say No when it's no and say yes when it's yes. That was the good part. There was also a lot of promoting psychotherapy including a whole chapter on having an intimate (non-sexual) relationship with your therapist. So, if you're into therapy then it's a good book if not, then just try to express yourself honestly and develop intimacy that way."
4,good quality.,"I needed a large cookie sheet and this is perfect. The nonstick is great. My only complaint is that my first batch of colors permanently strained the pan, even though I presaged and prevailed it"
2,Timely arrival but not in good shape!,This pan arrived as promised which would be much more appreciated if it had came in the without damage. The tab of the pan came with the edge and the middle deformed. The box was in no way bent up so I am to assume that the supplier actually shipped it this way which is disappointing. My mother wanted this pan and was kind in receiving it but I was embarrassed to give her a damaged gift for Christmas. I see that Amazon is reviewing this seller now as they have received numerous complaints so I am hoping this is just a one off and I am waiting to see what is done to remedy this error on the part of the supplier.
5,Top Quality,My wife absolutely loves these sheets! I bought one for her last year and she immediately requested another. She was *very* happy to receive it this Christmas. The original one has very little scratching or cooking marks after a full year of regular use. You pay for quality and you get it with this item.
1,Haven't used them yet.,Very disappointed in the condition of the cookie sheets. I finally got around to opening them and there was a 6 inch dent on one. The other one had two two inch dents. I don't see how this could have happened during shipping. I am disappointed as I think they were sent like that. I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning them. I hope they bake as well as my old ones. I have never been dissatisfied with anything I have gotten from Amazon.
1,doesn't work,"I knew it was too cheap to be real, but tried it anyways. The blank ink cartridge doesn't work. I won't even try the color one and go back to Epson cartridges."
2,Product appears to be used when I purchased it new.,I ordered this shredder and it was delivered today (7/28/08). This shredder appears to be used when I purchased it new with the top part scraped as well as the basket and rollers. There are also pieces of shredded paper in the basket.8/08 The product purchased appeared to be used. The company from which I purchased this shredder was able to discount the price enough to make it worthwhile to keep.
5,Spans many ages of parents and children,"I love this book for its heartwarming stories of raising children. Many of the parents reflect back on thier own upgringing and realize parenting isn't as easy as thier parents made it appear.And the priest who did the opening chapter, had a great idea for mothers in the congreation to give the sermon on Mother's Day and fathers on Fathers Day."
3,"An appetizer, not a Main serving, from an excellent writer","I found this a small delight from an author who has created fuller, deeper, more satisfying stories in the past. Not as minor an achievement, in my opinion, as Heat Wave, but well to the rear of my favorites such as According to Mark and Road to Lichfield. An awful lot of interior dialogue and telling rather than letting a story unfold. It does feel a bit patched together, a collection of fascinating characters that we dip in and out of, the weavings of a life. Some wise summarizings. But summaries aren't so often compelling fiction. It does add up to something that at times is moving and rich. In small servings. But the ending felt rushed, almost dispensed with too quickly, and I almost felt cheated by it. I felt the author abandoning her character and the story! I literally flipped the empty end pages in frustration, looking for more."
1,Skip this one,"What a disappointment! Can this book be by the same author who wrote ""The Photograph"" and ""Making Things Up"", both of which I thought were terrific. ""Spiderweb"" involves some unbearably self-absorbed and unappealing characters, very dismal plots and subplots, and a piece of gratuitous violence toward the end that made me want to throw it in the trash. I'm glad I got it from the library and didn't waste a penny on it! What a downer -- ugh!"
4,Great add-on to the Marine set,"We purchased this set after our daughter received the Marine set and enjoyed playing with it. It is a cute toy and she loves playing with it, once you add all of the additional pieces together with the Marine set they all spin together. The connection becomes loose easily though and requires you to piece them back together but all in all its a good toy."
3,These ear candles worked very well!,"I really like how well these worked. My ear was blocked badly because of a cold that I had so I purchased these and figured that the Lavender aroma therapy would be good for me as well. But, when I burned them I didn't smell any Lavender or aroma therapy aromas whatsoever. So, my only complaint about these is that they didn't have a scent of lavender and therefor didn't have any aroma therapeutic value to me."
