5,Suprisingly Perfect,"Every step from opening the box to transferring all my files, jumping on my network, etc. has been an easy and flawless process. I would recommend this to anyone, even if they've never used a Mac before. Even if OSX was not a nearly perfect OS this laptop would be worth every penny just for the fact that it is not pre-loaded with Vista."
2,Disappointed,"Got the thing from Apple.com about two months ago, Leopard pre-installed. Very disappointed with it. Here are the reasons:1. Computer freezes often or won't wake up after having been put to sleep. The only remedy is to force-restart it (use the button).2. Keyboard becomes completely unresponsive seemingly randomly and without any warning. Solution: see 1.3. Lots of Tiger-compatible programs are NOT supported by Leopard.4. The main interface design is ludicrous (e.g. transparent menu bar, semi-transparent 3D(!!?) shelf-like dock at which you have to peer hard to see which apps are running). A prime example of ruining something good while trying to make it better.5. Case material is a magnet for dust (mine is black, so it's obvious).6. Power adapter extremely overpriced (as is the whole thing, but that's the Mac tax), so buying a second one for work is no longer an easy option.Pros? Yeah, there are some, hence the 2nd star.Advice: wait some, and then wait some more. And then think twice."
1,Windows Users - BEWARE!!,"Writing this review on my old laptop with windows. Very unhappy with new macbook. Windows don't cover the whole screen making my 13 inch essentially a 10 inch. Very confusing and hard to navigate. Never tried Vista but lifetime windows user and I feel like I just walked into Starbucks for the 1st time and don't know the silly names they give their sizes. Can't ""double tap"" the touch pad - have to click on the button, so using one hand to navigate is not possible. Going to give it a shot over next couple of days before exchanging it for a windows based laptop."
3,Weird at fist then great,I had a few problems with shipping and the sound once I got it but every thing sorted out and now I love it.
5,exellent lap top computer,I am very impressed with this computer. it is quick and easy to work with. I like the white color of the computer it is impressive........
2,Needs Improvement!,"There are many things to like about this book, including the color pages, easy instructions, and the clear general layout. But there is one big problem with it that is preventing me from using the book. I can't clearly see the Excel screen pages, which are what I need to see in order to learn the material. Suggestion: make the book pages larger and/or remove the top part of the pages which have an overview and cute graphics (not really as necessary as a larger screen page!). I'm tired of using my magnifer and find the book unusable at this point. This was a waste of my money! If you are over 40 and/or like larger print, don't waste your time with this book."
5,Excel 2007,"I use this book everyday, easy to understand, easy to use. My spread sheets look just as good if not better than those in my work place that do this everyday. I am just slower, but who would know."
2,For Beginners Only,"If you've never used Excel, or if you know 2003 and just need something to explain all the new buttons in 2007, then maybe this book is for you. If you've got even a basic knowledge of Excel 2007, however, you will be better served by something like the Excel 2007 Bible. The information in Teach Yourself Visually is just too basic. Put it this way, there are as many pages devoted to printing(too much) as there are devoted to pivot tables(not nearly enough)."
5,Great Reference,This an amazing guide when first learning Excel. It is also an excellent reference when learning more as an experienced user!!!
4,easy to work with,"I found this book to be exactly what I needed. it was very easy to work with, and visuals were precise."
2,The graphics didn't help visually,"Don't get me wrong the graphics are good but I don't think the artist got much direction to help the text and subject. My eyes are good but I found the text could of been larger or at least a more easier to read font. Did not find this book as helpful as some of the other ""Teach Yourself Visually"" I've seen. Maybe it's the subject matter that's hard to explain through graphics."
3,Do not attempt this at home.,"I took a class with Dr. Marcoulides at Cal State Fullerton that used this book. There is no doubt that he is an expert in his field. He is also friendly and has a good sense of humor.That said, don't think that you can jump into this material unless you have a solid background in statistics. For while it says ""a first course"", I as a statistical novice in an MBA program was lost from the start. The book is complemented by the use of the statistical software SAS, but I found it hard to put the two together. Again, I attribute that more to my shortcomings than to Dr. Marcoulides.Anyone who is strong in statistics would do well with this guide. I am sure that Dr. Marcoulides would cheerfully help you through the rough spots!"
3,Mufflers,Mufflers seem to be well built. The sound is great. They are quiet when mantaining a constant speed and really sound good when accelerating and decelerating. Delivery was as promised and as expected.
4,2007 3.5 SE Altima Rumbler,"I was hesitant to buy mufflers for my car because its' hard to find ones that aren't too expensive and tuned for it. These magnaflows worked out really well. They have a low rumble at around 2-3k rpm. The noise dies down almost completely after the 3k mark. As they have broken in they have become louder which is true of most mufflers. It sounds almost a little too loud for my taste at some times, but if you are getting them for sound then you're making a good choice. I really wanted them for the look more than the sound because the stock exhaust looks so wimpy and these don't add any performance benefit. For the price you can't go wrong with these cans. I'd buy them again and they fit perfect on the Altima. The cutout for the pipe is almost a perfect match for these."
3,Not what i expected !,I got this installed on my 02 Civic Si...the muffler looks great but did not change the sound much. I expected it to be lot louder than this. but this thing is not loud at all. but i do think that it made a lil differnce in the pick up. And the muffler does not look the same as shown in the picutre. I'd say it only made about 25% difference in the sound.
4,A fun read!,"A likeable cast of characters and a swiftly-moving plot make for an entertaining read. My only complaint is that I figured out the solution a little too early on... I would rather have had to work a bit more. Still, it was great fun and I'm online right now to see what else is available in the series - I'm going to get them all! Looking forward to reading more Mandy Dyer mysteries."
4,Enjoyable,"This was a fun book, even though there is a point at which the killer becomes obvious - usually that annoys me, but the story was flowing along so well, I didn't mind this time. It created some anticipation for that big moment when Mandy would figure it all out at the worst possible time. Good, likeable characters right down to the cat and look forward to reading more of the series."
5,A PARENTS BIBLE!,"What a fun and exciting book! The authors have two completely different opinions on how to raise your child. This is the best child raising book I've read yet! I loved it so much, I bought another copy for a baby shower gift!"
5,Interesting!,"This is a great reference book with two different authors commenting on the same topics - good format.I enjoyed this book and will be using many of the ""techniques"" posted with my own children....Debbie Coules"
2,Disappointing,"When you first put this on, under eyes for bagginess, it tightens up the skin very well in about 5 minutes. But then within a short time it turns waxy looking and makes your under eyes look worse. I've tried using very, very little, which seemed to be the best solution. BUT it still flaked after a few hours. I followed all the instructions regarding using with make up as well and that also was not a success.Now I sometimes just use it in the morning to tighten the bags and then wash off before using make up. It gives a little improvement. But I wouldn't buy it again."
3,not sure,"I am purchasing this product for the first time. I should have read the reviews before I placed my order but I did not. After reading a few of the postings it makes one not want to purchase this product at all. But I do understand that what might work for some people, might not necessarily work for others. So as soon as I get and start using this product I will post the pros and cons of buying it, if there are any. For the sake of the seller I hope that my post will be a positive one. Will keep ya'll updated.."
2,Not quite what I ordered,"I did get the Hedgecoe Complete Guide to Photography, but it was a softcover copy, not the hard cover that I ordered."
4,Essential book for photographers,"I haven't finished this book yet, as it's a little dry for my reading style preference, but it definitely contains the basics any photographer needs to know."
4,great tire for the price,"Definitely not a fast tire by any means, but has excellent grip. This tire is perfect for transforming a universal bike into a more of an mtb cycle."
2,"good price, but hard to like much else","I ran this tire about 200 miles on the road and another 100 on gravel, cross-country and technical singletrack trails. I never used it in mud, which might be the best environment for this tire.The main problem is the tread is very pliable. It isn't firm at all, and this leads to squirm that you can really feel on roads and hard-packed gravel. I had very little cornering confidence. Even pumped up to max pressure, which usually is not necessary or a good idea, they rolled slowly.Poor puncture resistance-- if you run over a goathead thorn, you're going to get a flat. (I resolved this by installingMr. Tuffy Bicycle Tire Linerwhich I highly recommend for everyone.)You can't get hardly any other tires at this price, but I couldn't live with the performance and removed them. I'm now far happier withSchwalbe Smart Sam HS 367 Performance Cross/Hybrid Bicycle Tire - Wire Bead."
2,meaty in all the wrong places,"I raced one cross race on these in a lot of mud. They are pretty hard to handle, even considering how cheap they were. Handling is even worse on pavement, as they have a square profile from the huge knobs. Cornering was always very difficult and I had zero confidence in them. I eventually sold them on a bike that didn't fit me."
5,A Well Organized Book,"Being from Houston I naturally collect astronaut autographs. I was happy to see that ""The Celebrity Address Handbook & Autograph Guide"" list all the current and former astronauts. I am looking to blast-off into autograph collecting with a lot of success. I like the way this book is organized. Instead of me hunting through an alphabetized list, I can go to the section of my choice and see all the names and addresses in that category. It is a time saver. I like this book and recommend it to all autograph collectors."
1,The Celebrity Address Handbook & Autograph Guide 2000,"I am so disappointed with this book. I purchased it for my 12 year old son for Christmas this year. He immediately began writing to his favorite stars. Much to my dismay, almost EVERY ONE of his letters has been returned because every address was INCORRECT and the mail was not deliverable! If you are looking for a book with accurate addresses for movie/tv stars...don't buy this one! I'm hoping that I might be able to get my money back, which will barely pay for all the wasted stamps."
1,Not on my A list,"I am not sure who these other people are who provided reviews for this book. Most of things they say are included are simply not true. I bought this exact SAME book this Febuary and I have looked through the whole thing and there is no guarentee from the publisher that if the addresses provided don't work that you can contact them and they will give you new ones. As well there is not section that tells where celebrities have been sighted. As for the accuracy of the address, well I have recieved 4 undeliverable letters back already, which I sent out the day I bought this book a month ago! If you are looking for accuracy in addresses, save you money and buy one of the other one's that Amazon offers. Perhaps they are more correct, and you won't be wasting you money like you would be by purchasing this book. And don't worry, I will be writing to the author and publisher to tell them what I think!"
1,This Teacher Grades This Book Unsatisfactory!,"I have been collecting autographed pictures for over 5 years now and have a collection of over 200. I was looking forward to working on my hobby, with the aid of this book, this summer. Within a month of receiving this book I had sent out 200 requests for autographs. I am sad to say that I have received 48 of them back and am still receiving more back each week. Several addresses were wrong..no such number, no such street.., that star is not at the agency listed, some were declined, and more reasons were listed on the envelopes. The cost of the returned postage has far exceeded the cost and worth of this book. Try another to really get something worthwhile."
1,Zadro 5x/10/ magnification sopt mirror with suction cups and light,"Well, it is to small and the light switch went bad after two uses. Not pleased with the product like I was hoping."
5,WONDERFUL! SAUCE,"We originally purchased this in all places - Ross - on a closeout for cheap. It was soooooo good I went looking for more. At that time I couldget it from the vendor, but not any more. I'm so glad to find it here. This is just delightful - it has a nice kick but not hot! I get heartburn with other hot sauces - but not with this!! Love it on chicken. TRY IT!!"
5,Someone Grew An Epistemology/Pineapple Artichoke!,"The rationale for this Amazon review stems from the fact that Amazon recommended ""Things Merely Are"" by Simon Critchley and I bit. But it turned out that this short volume is well-written, even lucid,[his choice of audience extends beyond the academy]and focuses on the inverse relationship of imagination and reality as found in ""The Snowman"":""Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is."" Critchley has a strong reading of Stevens and develops a theory of how poetry works which has a clarity unknown to H Bloom in ""The Poems of Our Climate."" ""Things Merely Are"" is a from my perspective a welcome addition to the conversation about Stevens and is of the quality produced by Helen Vendler."
4,"Instrumental Stereolab, lounge-jazz style","This has many of the same musical elements as Stereolab, minus the vocals and with a jazzier feel. The bass lines are prominent, bouncey, and very fuzzy. The drums are excellent, adding a jazzy, frenetic quality to the music, mostly cymbal work. The other main instruments are guitar (playing short riffs, again similar to a Stereolab song), keyboard, and occasionally trumpet. The enveloping sound and rhythm are the greatest parts of this album, with many of the songs being in interesting time signatures. Each track has a peaceful yet fast paced, trance-inducing groove. Never harsh, extremely well produced music. All tracks are excellent, with my favorites being #2 and #5. In seven words: fun, intelligent, whimsical, like Stereolab doing jazz."
4,Student who uses it,"Hi Our class uses this book(were in 6th grade at a private school) and this is our text book it does give a god grsp but could be laid out better. Very good overall though. Ihave learned alot, and it isnt the teacher trust me."
5,Very educational!,This book teaches many new words and phrases that are very useful to the Latin beginner
4,"Great book, condition is as described.",We knew the book was well-used before we got it. Felt sorry for whomever went through page by page to erase previous answers!
2,"They keep losing ""it.""","Hmm? For old schoolers, such as myself The Narrow Scope of Things is just that. Once again...gone are the days of death. After swearing off a brutal slab of bone crushing death metal with the release of Embrace the Eternal, Embodyment has once again changed direction. After parting with they're vocalist they traded the metal-core hybrid that made them a housesold name for an emo-ish something. Whether or not they're filling the trend pocket they're focus is still on spreading God's word. New fans will love it...those who remember will be shaking their heads.El Kabong gives it two headbangs(can you bang to emo?)."
4,Embody this!,"The new cd from embodyment was a welcome change from the first cd...personally...the thrash and hardness of the previous album neither separated itself from other bands nor did it elevate itself in that genre. However, the new singer's warm, pensive, and deep voice gives the band a twist of intrigue for someone that is looking for something new, exciting and challenging to the ear. The voicing in the album evokes a deeper sense of musicianship and character than wood the yelling. Check this disc out...a welcome change from the expected sounds of rock, shock, and hollerin."
3,Good but not great...,"I am a big fan of most everyone on the roster (ergo this particular choice), but sometimes the production values were a little lacking (strange or improper mic placement, out of tune pianos etc). Certainly, personal preferences are at play here, but I would think Verve might have given us a little classier ""Very Best of..."""
4,Verve Jazz Christmas,I recommend this to anyone that likes smooth jazz and wants mood music for Christmas gatherings. Combine this with other smooth jazz Christmas recordings and let them shuffle on your CD player and you are guaranteed to have a festive occassion.
1,Just plain bad,"Inconsistent. Incomplete. Boring. There are thousands of books on this subject more thoroughly researched, complete and exciting than this volume. Wasted money!"
2,Not a Page Turner,"I read the reviews about this game and expected an experience similar to the Myst series. The graphics are beautiful throughout this game and the voice acting is as good as it can be with the material provided; however, it falls short in too many other areas for it to be called ""fun."" The storyline is somewhat intriquing, but definitely not a page turner. The characters are lifeless and uninteresting. Even the main character, Kate Walker, is a bore. The ""puzzles"" throughout the game are mindless and, for the most part, lack logic. You might be better off reading a good mystery novel."
2,Very disappointing,"I thought this game was slow and boring. The controls were ackward and movement was difficult. The scenery was detailed, but I spent more time looking around than actually doing anything. I can't really say what was specifically lacking. I thought it was uninteresting, hard to manuver through, and rather dull. I played it for a few days, hoping something about it would grab me, but nothing every did."
4,Traditional Regency,"Set in the country, lots of elderly retainers, servants with character. A couple of Bow Street runners etc. It's a difficult book to describe without giving the plot away.Well worth reading.From the back cover of the Mills & Boon large print edition....For Megan Drew, the arrival of 1800 brought Christian Blackmore back into her life, when he became guardian to her niece, Sophie. Megan had expected to marry Christian, only for him to marry an heiress - though within a year his wife was dead and Christian had left for India. Both of them had changed but if Megan were truthful with herself one thing had never changed - her feelings for the man she had loved beyond words."
5,Jake....NOT AGAIN!,This time Jake Sherman has switched bodies with a space alien. But this is no regular alien! He comes from a race who sits on their lazy butts eating pork rinds and watching tv. This alien is also really funny and dorky looking. The alien likes the new body and runs away with it. Will Jake ever get it back???
4,Cool drum set...once you figure out how to put it together.,"This is a very nice, very complete set- seems to be good quality. HOWEVER, we were scrambling on Christmas Eve to put it together WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS! Found them online, but they really have to put them in the box."
3,misleading picture,"The picture that is shown looks just like any other of the full size drums. I was going by the fact that it say's 3-8, which my son has just turned 8, so i thought this would be perfect. Because i told him if he dedicates himself or at least continues to on a regular basis practice, I would get him a full size set. He is already to big for it and might as well let his little sister have it. Bottom line it should be called a toddler set not a junior set."
5,Great Set!,We bought this for our 6 year old grandson. Was very easy to put together and a great quality set.
5,Awesome Drum Set!!!,"I got this drum set for my early musician 2 yo son. He does not get tired of playing with it. The set is like a pro one but junior size. VERY WELL DONE, EXCELLENT QUALITY AND CAN TAKE A TODDLER'S BEATING!!!"
4,Solid Drum Set,For 2 months now my 3 year-old has consistently beat on this drum set and it takes all the punishment he dishes out. The set is very sturdy and sounds great. The only complaint I have is that the base drum legs don't work well so I had to use wooden blocks to keep everything upright.
5,Kids drum set,"WE LOVE THIS DRUM SET! My 4 year old son can play on it as if he's lead drummer! My girls (ages 6, 8, 10) and I play along on the drums with the Wii Beatles Rock Band. Sounds awesome! Just thought I'd let you know that it is durable, feels like a good sounding drum set for the money. We will use it everyday!Ariana Ruiz"
4,Drums,"We've just recently purchased this drum set. So far so good. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because (like our previous set - though, a different brand)the pieces loosen with use and tend to fall off. The cymbal came off already but only from a loosened screw. As long as you routinely tighten the parts you should be good to go. Our son is 6 and loves these drums."
3,Be yourself Leann,"While she does a decent job with some songs, I just wish she would go back to singing like herself and stop trying to sing like all the other ""pop"" singers. She had an amazing voice, just wish she would go back to her ""roots"" and sing from her heart and not her head. I know in my heart that she could bring chills singing ""O Holy Night"", if only she would sing it like she really should. I had to turn off ""White Christmas"", it is not good at all. Bing is turning over on that one!"
1,Another butchering of O Holy Night,"Why do singers feel the need to butcher these very old holiday songs? Sing it right, people, or don't sing it at all. Rimes totally destroyed an incredible Christmas song. Easily the worst version I've ever heard and I've heard alot."
1,Catterwalling,I heard Rockin' Around the Christmas tree and thought I would like what a wonderful Christmas. All I can say is the kid did a fantastic butcher job on everything else on the disc.
3,O Dreadful Night,I look for O Holy Night when I am thinking about buying a Christmas CD. This is sadly the worst rendition of this beautiful Christmas song among this year's offerings. Try Chris Isaak instead........
1,just plain awful,"Now, don't get me wrong, I actually happen to be a fan of Ms. Rimes. I bought this Christmas CD to add to my collection, and totally wasted my money. Her voice on this CD is just atrocious and annoying, and her butchery of ""Oh Holy Night"" is just plain obscene. Stick with her regular CD's and pass on this one , if you know what is good for you."
3,could've been better,"I like how LeAnn sounds backed by the Big Band music, ...but I'm not really into her song choices. She sings ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" like the version on Christina Aguilera's album - totaly unoriginal! I liked ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"", ""A Different Kind of Christmas"", and ""O Holly Night"" the best. ""What A Wonderful World"" is okay when she sings it,...but I perfer Aselin Debison's version - which says a lot since Aselin's singing voice can't even compare to LeAnn's...because LeAnn usualy sings a lot better. Also LeAnn does well with ""Santa Baby"" and ""Just Love Me""...but those songs are too sassy for my taste.I think the song that surprised me most on the cd is LeAnn's cover of ""All I Want For Christmas."" I know the original version well and I always pictured LeAnn would do well with it - but that's just not so."
1,High Background Noise,...It works as advertised but recordings with the built-in microphone have an unacceptable level of background noise. Recording in completely quiet surroundings revealed that this is the noise of the recorder's own mechanism. A plug-in microphone (not included) away from the recorder would not pick up the recorder's noise but if you want to use the built-in microphone do not buy this recorder without checking the background noise.
4,Good replacement option,"While this was slightly different from the stock tea basket that came with my tea maker (and not black, but white) it was indeed a fine replacement, and has served me well for some time now."
5,COPING WITH CYSTITIS,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL, INFORMATIVE BOOK THAT I ADDED TO MY COLLECTION SINCE I HAVE THE DISEASE. IF YOU HAVE THE ILLNESS, I RECOMMEND HIGHLY THAT YOU ADD IT TO YOUR LIBRARY!"
1,14.8v laptop battery,"This laptop battery is exactly as advertised. Right after installing the battery, I was able to start up my laptop. After charging it, the battery lasted approximately 3 hours. I am very happy with my purchase. I can use my laptop again without keeping it plugged in.Revision on my review. This laptop battery did not last. It only lasted about 4 months and didn't work again. Do not buy."
4,Dependable Laptop Battery,The replacement battery was received in good condition and right on time. I am very happy with my purchase experiences through Amazon.
2,Did not last,Worked great for the first six months. Now the battery will no longer hold a charge. I would not recommend this item.
1,WTF?!,"What the hell is this?! Not even one month after getting this battery, I will no longer hold a charge! It worked great for the first couple of weeks! Then one day, nothing! And I don't even use it on a daily basis either! Hell, I left it alone for a week and that is when things started to NOT happen. Now it will say it's charging, but it also says that there is 0% Power Remaining. If I had wanted a battery that won't hold any kind of charge, I would have just stayed with the battery I had and wouldn't have wasted the money on this thing!"
5,works great,it fit perfectly. it works great. the price is very reasonable. it was packaged properly. now i can use my laptop running off of the battery. it is exactly as advertised.
2,Not very comfortable,The chair looks good but I found it to be uncomfortable. I have a small frame and the back and seat of it was uncomfortable even for me. In a pinch I would sit there but not for long. I returned it.
5,minn kota motor plate,it a very nice plate that you can remove your fresh motor when going salt water fishing or not needed and with the lock feather it makes a lot harder to steal the motor / a very good buy and is needed with all minn kotas needed removel when not in use
4,Does the Job,"This is a solid, easy to install product. The only problem I had installing the unit was one of the holes did not align and I had to enlarge the hole a little. I have had the Quick Release Bracket installed for a couple of weeks now and have not had any problems with the unit."
4,Strong and Functional Mount for MinnKota Terrova 55 Trolling Motor,"Unable to use this purchase this year on the boat but will try it out early next year. The quality and function of the mount seems to meet all expectations. First impression was that it was composed of strong, durable material."
3,Not 'dumb' enough.....,"Although the friends that I bought this book for are enjoying it, it doesn't give them the minute details that they really need. They have never had a computer before and this book assumes they know more than they do. We forget how overwhelming the computer was for us when we first got started and assume that everyone has a basic understanding of what to do. If this book is truly for dummies, it needs to be really basic for such people."
3,I rate this book as a little past FAIR....,"I did not find this as helpful or as easy as another book I have gotten. The illustrations are not so bad. There is just not enough of them. The directions are not really in step by step, with illustration and not easy to understand as my other book on Vista is. It is not really done with a clear understanding of ease that a novice would need to be comfortable to use this book."
1,pointless,"I have found this book to be just about useless, and regret spending money for it. I don't think I have found anything helpful about anything I have tried to look up."
4,Vista Vs. XP,"I was pleased with Andy's xp for dummies so I bought this one mainly for help installing old xp programs on vista ,but found very little help in that department.The rest of the book is very informative,but if you own the xp book you won't be impressed."
1,Not worth it,I purchased this book to learn my way around Vista. I didn't think it was worth the money. It was more like a Welcome to Windows beginner book. I haven't found anything on here that has been helpful in my Vista experience. Much easier to just research online....
5,window vista for dummies,"Windows Vista for Dummies by Andy Rathbone is the manual every computer beginner or not such a beginning dummy needs! It is so very instructive without heavy technical explanations that make you forget your original problem. It plainly and simply walks you through each feature on your computer, in general and how to use the internet intelligently and safely. What I really like is that Andy throws in so many tips and and great ways to make your life simple during your search. Highly recommend it!"
2,"NOT EVEN A SINGLE SENTANCE ABOUT ""DOWNLOADING""","I bought this book because I'm new to computers (I learned math on an abacus) so without embarassing my self to bother my kids or grandkids every day I bought this book to learn how to download my favorite music. Expecting a full chapter of 'how tos' to my dismay the ONLY mention was ""WHEN YOUV""E DOWNLOADED SUCH AND SUCH"" what a waste of $$$ guess I'll call my grandkid huh?"
2,Basic,Windows Vista explain the normal tools or programs that users normally apply on the oldest windows versionThe only difference is the location on some tools or programs.
2,I am still a Vista Dummy,"Although I got a few tips out of this book (how to make the start bar appear as it did in Windows XP), I found very little useful information. This would be a great book for someone who is brand new to Windows, but I expected it to have more information about converting."
5,window vista,i like this book this book helps me out with my window vista and i enjoy very much thank you
4,good buy,Found this in the electronic chain store and looked through it to see if it would be something I wanted. then I went online and saved money.
4,Pleased with product,Ordered a used book as a gift to my Dad for Christmas. Very pleased that it arrived with plenty of time to spare. Have purchased used books before from Amazon and continue to be surprised at their good condition.
5,VERY helpful,Thank you for this great book. I am a senior citizen and do not have much saavy about computers. This book is just the ticket.I bought it used and it was in EXCELLENT condition.
5,Windows Vista For Dummies,The book has been a tremendious help in navigating thru the Windows Vista format. without it I was ready to chunk the computer.
5,Help for an 85 Year Old Dummy,"This dummy really needed help with Vista and, reading from back to front and browsing for particular problems, I have learned how to cope with some of the differences between Vista and XP.I also have Dummies for Office 2007, WordPerfect7, Quattro Pro6, Quicken2008 and Digital Photography, so I guess that makes me a major dummy ~~~~"
4,EXTREMELY HELPFUL,"I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE QUITE HELPFUL, AND TO THE POINTIT IS WRITTEN IN PLAIN ENGLISH, WITH OUT ALL THE UNNECESSAY PROGRAMMERBUZZ WORDS."
4,Good Introduction To Windows Vista,"""Windows Vista For Dummies"" is a good read for the person wanting to learn more information about Windows Vista.Some of the topics covered include:1. Working with programs and documents.2. Introduction to Windows Vista.3. Playing music and movies.4. Using the internet.5. Customizing your desktop.And etc.While some folks may take issue with the rather bland black and white illustrations, the content is easy to follow and understand. Perhaps the lack of color may explain why the book may be priced lower than other similar titles!Read, enjoy, and learn!Recommended."
5,Sucess,I got this Issue In a timely matter.This book is easy to undersatnd the Windows Vista for Dummies is well worth the money* If you Try it you'll enjoy it. It's a keeper.
2,You always know it's there,"Good enough looking. The alarm is kind of a pain to set, but I guess that's part of not being ""digital"". I will buy white-faced watches from now on, but that's not the issue that bothers me about this watch. The band is ill-designed. The gaps in it open and close in such a way that throughout the day the hairs of your wrist are being torn at and ripped out. You never forget it's on. My last watch was a Bulova. I put it on and soon forgot it was even there. This will never happen with this one. I'm using it, but it was a disappointment. Wouldn't buy another for over $75."
5,Tremendous!,"It grabbed my attention at the first sight and I decided to order it...simple!But after opening the package, it looked so that I decided not to wear it and give it to my father, the loveliest man in my life, as a gift!Thanks Seiko!"
1,Bad on the Face of It,"Terrible!!! When there is light above the watch, it is virtually impossible to make out the minute or hour hands. The two tones on the face make it very difficult to scan the time. Setting the alarm is very cumberson. This is NOT a well designed item. I would have returned it had I not had links removed from the band to obtain an appropriate fit.I am very frustrated with my gift ofthis time piece and cannot recommend it to anyone."
3,Nice to look at,"I really liked the look of this watch the first time I saw it. I did read the reviews about how difficult it was to read the time, but I decided I wanted the watch anyway. While I do still like the way the watch looks on my wrist, I must agree that it is hard to read the time because the hands blend into the face. It is also quite heavy, like most stainless steel watches. For now I will wear it as a dress watch and stick with my old titanium watch for everyday use."
2,"You might be a beach bunny, but surf diva?","This book was cute, but lacked real useful information and descriptions of techniques, moves and etiquette essential to holding your own in the water. Maybe because the authors run a surf school, they didn't want to give away all the good information that you pay a lot more for when you sign up for their school. This book was like a big advertisement for the surf school with extra tips about matching your bikini and toenail polish to your board. I appreciated the part about doing your part to keep the oceans clean, but that was the meatiest part of the book. I purchased two books for beginning female surfers at the same time. The other one was fabulous and I refer to it as a reference constantly. This one is more useful as a beach read on a flat day."
5,A witty and informative surf guide for women,"The Surf Diva book is one of many examples that show how women are making comeback (both women and men surfed in ancient Polynesian culture) in this fantastic sport!I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and I think the Surf Diva design is both fun and feminine. It's also nice to have a female perspective on this great sport! After reading it I felt a renewed sense of surfing with aloha. It also reminded me that ""the best surfers in the water are the ones having the most fun"". I couldn't agree more!"
2,Chinese Work Songs - Little Feat,"Not one of their best efforts. The songs weren't up to the usual quality of the albums and CDs I own from this band. After reading the reviews online and then receiving it, I've decided that I will listen more carefully next time to the tracks. They need better song writing. They may be great musical artists but the song selections were marginal at best for most of this one. Little Feat has been one of my favorite bands thruout the years, but this doesn't make the list."
4,"Reminds me of the ""old"" Feat","This is a better album than their last two-it really jumps out and grabs you. Feat is still a rockin band with Paul B handling the majority of the vocals. Several of the tunes remind me of ""Time Loves A Hero"" album. Tunes like ""Rag Mama Rag"" and ""Euela"" will really get your bones rockin. They even cover a Phish tune-""Sample in a Jar"" which really moves. If you have been a Feat fan in the past and have been a bit dissapointed in their lastest works, this one will not dissapoint."
3,Uninspired by this Feat,"I'm a great Little Feat lover, but I was disappointed by this one. The styles are formulaic, and I didn't feel that Shaun Murphy was really part of the band. Sorry but the title song is just annoying. I wanted to give my kids a taste of the truly creative rock that these folks made way back when - well this is not it."
4,"You'll Just Love This, Darling","One does not expect an actress whose public persona is not of the literati to so narrate so well her life story. Zsa Zsa does indeed succeed in telling us how she was raised and transitioned into acting along with a frank assessment of her many marriages. She even tells us a couple of funny stories worthy of a master comedian, such as the parrot episode. (You'll have to buy the book to find out)If there is one thing that the book may lack is more behind-the-scenes observations of the various television and film productions in which she acted.Still, an enjoyable read."
3,Complete Garbage,"I purchased this book mainly to get some info on George Sanders. I didn't know much about Zsa Zsa, and was hoping she would divulge some juicy facts about him. But- it's so absurd and full of egocentric fables, and I'm not sure I even believe the majority of the stories she tells. She continually refers to her 'beauty', and how this man or that was so madly in love with her, would kill to have her, etc. I'm only on husband number 4 though, and so far all of them cheated on her. Hmmm, what's wrong with this picture? It's just a jumbled mess that isn't well-told. In one sentence she claims to be 'devastated' over her divorce, but in the next she talks about how in love she is with another man and refers to the hot sex they had. It's like a bad article in a trashy tabloid that goes on and on and on...."
2,Half-way there.,"There are some good points made in this book, but the the authors own personal preferences are very dated and opinionated. Hair color is neither right nor wrong--it's a preference. Secretaries do need to care about their personal grooming, but preferences are personal, and should stay that way."
2,"useless with itouch, useless tips","I purchased this to power up my itouch and nokia phone during a 4 day train trip. After hooking up to my itouch it seemed to work, then abruptly stopped. Probably an itouch software issue with usb. Then my Nokia phone does not fit any tips provided with this. You have to purchase separate tips for $9 or more apiece. Cannot power my psp without buying yet another tip. It claims to handle all these brand names, but only some of their actual products.Stay away from this one. It's outdated and just needs lots of pricey separate accessories to work."
5,Very Cool,"I bought the Batman Bust bank and the Robin Bust Bank for my two boys... both are really cool looking and well made... They are very durable... The Batman one is much larger then the Robin one, although they are the same price... If choosing between the two, the Batman one is much more bank for the price..."
4,Batman bust bank,"Got this for myself after getting Surperman and Cat woman as gifts for other people. The prices on the bust superhero banks have really gone up,i was surprized to see the increase compared to when i got mine. They must be getting rare. Nice sculpture of the Batman."
3,You can bank on Batman!,"This has proven to be a durable bank, and a good way to help the kids want to save money (at least for a little while)."
4,"Great kit, not so good packaging","Everything one would need for a typical chimney installation except in my case i needed a firestop for the 2nd floor.Attic insulation shield is not like the instructions show, but all one-piece welded construction, and incorporates a telescoping radiation shield tube. Good stuff, but the packaging needs improvement as there were a few pieces that were dented or squashed out-of-shape. These were corrected with some TLC (be sure to wear leather gloves). The roof flashing is all aluminum, not stainless steel. Also the stovepipe adapter will not slide into ""HeatFab brand Satety-Pipe"", but will fit ""Simpson"" brand pipe."
5,A MUST READ!,"This book has it all--military combat, intrigue, mystery, love, power and suspense. It is sure to capture a variety of audiences with diverse interests. The plot is set twenty years in the future, but the political possibilities will haunt you today. The sophistication of the novel belies the authors' young ages. The characters are painted with such careful attention that you will find yourself identifying with the heros--only to find your instincts misplaced. This is the type of book you will keep on your bedstand to read your favorite scenes over and over. Though with this book, that just may end up being cover to cover."
4,pretty good,"This is much easier to use than any heated or liquid wax which I have tryed once, made a mess and there for never tryed again. My first use of this product was on my upper lip. the strips were fabulous!! worked like a charm, the hair came right off with little pain. I have tryed them on the bakini area and under arms and don't have much luck. perhaps I need to exfoliate more or warm it up more because it doesn't pull hardly any hair off. But for the finer hair on the face it works wonderfully."
5,I love these strips.,"I've tried using a couple of other brands of ready-to-use wax and I always come back to these ones. I'm not a fan of the oil wipes that come with it, so I tend to just rinse whatever I wax with soap and water. I mostly use them for my eyebrows, and these strips are perfect for that. Not so sure about bikini, but if you want to wax your face, these ones are the way to go."
3,Woman's point of view,"Product works, though sometimes it has to be applied several times. Still it is convenient and easy to use."
3,.hack//sign is a good series,".hack//sign is a very creative series. With 4 video games, and 26 episodes of //sign, and several of //dusk (unreleased in America to my knowledge), it's an expansive series. This collection of episodes (15-18) has nothing particularly spectacular. Warning, this series is not fast-paced. If you like action, get Trigun, or Neon Genesis Evangelion. But for those who love a deep and intricate storyline that will captivate you, get into .hack//sign."
5,"""To be or not to be?"" Eisler restates the question.","An amazing journey through the life of a one-time Jewish refugee who has found his way to a retirement home on West End Avenue. Here, he eventually directs a production of Hamlet put on by the residents and comes to understand himself better in the process. Loaded with humor and peopled with characters you don't want to miss, this book digs much deeper than is belied by its light-hearted approach"
4,Brilliantly Tied Together,"Hamlet as metaphor for the self-denial practiced by German Jewry as the earth was set on fire around them - brilliant theory and nicely carried through in this novel by Isler. The reader becomes engrossed in the story told piecemeal by Korner, the ""Prince"" of a German-Jewish family and later a holocaust survivor haunted by the voices of ghosts he is desperate to ignore. Like Hamlet, the soul tortured by the voice of his father's ghost, Korner is tortured by his past actions (or rather inactions) during the Shoah. Though not a loveable or perhaps even likeable character, the reader comes to empathetize with him so much so that his catharsis is so palpable that we yearn for it and feel its release with him. Perhaps a little slow for some readers in the beginning; I say stick with it and you will feel rewarded when you finish. Marvelous for book club discussion groups."
5,The Prince of West End Avenue,"Literary excellence -- amusing at times, yet a deeply poignant story. Alan Isler is a writer of great erudition and obviously enormous intelligence."
2,much ado about nothing,"noone in our reading group will admit to recommending this book. needless to say we didn't like it and don't understand the great reviews it received. the characters are uninteresting, the plot unconvincing and the novel does not tie together. true, the gimmicks in the directing of the play are cute, but it doesn't make for a good literary event."
3,got 45 minutes?,"That's all you need to watch this film. Desires of the Heart is like a lot of other Christian movies with scenes that look like they were taped by a home video and acting that's just so so. The message is quick and to the point, with the movie depicting a modern day Jacob and Esau. The writers really took this all the way, with the sons being named Ethan and Jack, the mom, Becca, and the dad Ike Abrams. (In the Bible, it's Rebecca and Isaac, with Abraham being the father of Isaac.) The story plays out with a few flashbacks, mainly giving us a background of the deception that occurred and then bringing home the lesson on forgiveness, especially as some of the dialogue towards the end turns into mini sermons. Not a bad way to spend 45 minutes, though not a film I'd watch again."
3,Doesn't Flow as well as Grammer Workbook,"I purchase this math workbook with a grammer workbook to keep my 11 year old in the rythm of doing homework everyday during summer. Math is strongest skill, but he prefered the GRAMMER workbook. This Math workbook didn't communicate or interest him."
3,Overpriced and Too Basic,"The presentation of this book gives the impression that it is a legal text, however it only skims the surface of issues related to Special Education law. There are good refereces to caselaw in each section that would be helpful to an individual that is not familiar with conducting legal research, to provied a starting point to find relevant caselaw. However, it would be a big mistake to rely on these in lieu of conducting specific jurisdictional and current research. Other than a more in depth review of caselaw you can save alot of money by buying the Wrightslaw book to get an overview of the law in this area or read the law/regulations for free and conduct free legal research of federal caselaw at numerous internet sites."
3,"More production, less bluesy","Personally I prefer The Dark of the Night to this latest effort. Night had a slightly grittier tone to it, perhaps more Buddy Guy influenced. Angels in Exile is a bit softer and less memorable to my ears. Scott Holt is a great guitarist and I look forward to his next CD."
3,Misclassified,"There is no doubt that Mr. Holt is a fine guitarist, but i would not classify this cd as a blues cd. There are a couple of tracks that are bluesy (#2 for example), but if one is looking for some some deep blues guitar playing, this is not the cd to get. I bought this cd on spec; and ended up with a major dissapointment. The CD has rocker tunes (wailing guitar mixed in with a flurry of rhythm guitar wash) but has little of the bluesy feel (check out Rick Holmstrom's Hydraulic Groove for a contrast). Best track is a cover of Spanish Moon."
2,"Angels in exile, my review from Barcelona","Angels in Exile' is an album by former Buddy Guy Band guitarist, Scott Holt. Besides George's ""Spanish Moon"", no doubt the best track, and perhaps some other song like the opening track ""Baby Let's Go"", the boogies ""Too Far Gone"", ""I'll Make Love To You Anytime"" and ""Up In Flames"", a little mysterious but interesting, the remainder of the record practically has no interest at all. It is very limp and has a bungled sound. Furthermore, it isn't a truly Blues record. For me it ended up being a major disappointment, specially the two last themes. I expected much more from Holt, no doubt a very good guitarist. I give it 2,5 stars."
2,not really a train trip,"I bought this thinking it would be a train trip thru Alaska, which it is, in part. But there is also alot of airplane footage and boat rides. The entire video is not very informative nor do you see anything that you haven't allready seen in other videos. Wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for information on traveling in Alaska, it simply skims the surface and disappoints."
4,Alaska,"This is a good stand alone disc, but it is the first disc of America's scenic Rail Journeys which is a 2 disc, I was a little dissapionted when I went to play and found I had doubled up with that disc."
1,cloned and old concepts,"Am sorry, but I have never been more disappointed in a game. The art work seemed cloned from older games, no free movement, just follow the path. Just terrible. When I spend almost $50 for a game I expect something for my money. Doubt I will throw cash at another game created by this source again any time soon."
2,Another 2-dimensional anime kids game,"What adults buy games like this? This is a kid's game, it's in 2 dimensions, like Final Fantasy. I don't mind some turn-based games IF the strategy is cool, but like some other reviewers commented, this game is terrible. You just run into the enemy and hit the x or square button a couple of times, then wait to get hit. Is that 2006 technology? You can have more fun playing Tomb Raider or a PC game. I wish they would divide up RPG's into two distinct types: first-person 3-D world-roaming games, and anime 2-D turn-based kid's games."
4,Great Game,"Valkyrie Profile 2 is a great game to play. The story is filled with twists and turns that will leave you palying for hours and hours just to see what happens next. The battle system is pretty good, as well.Pros:Good plotGood graphicsFun battle systemCons:Not as impressive on getting personal enough with characters."
2,Great graphics awful game play,"This game has an interesting story a bit funny because the female lead character is talking to herself through most of the game, yeah I already know the reasons why she talks to herself, but its still a comedy skit waiting to happen.Well enough about the humorous side of the game lets get to the most importaunt part the game play let me start by saying the graphics are great, and I like the lead characters teleportation abilities, she can use the souls of departed evil to teleport herself across rooms, or freeze the souls to leap on things that part I kind of liked. but what I didn't like is the repetitive fighting style in the game, the fighting style also seemed to hectic and all over the place, it was nothing like I expected and ultimately I found the game boring though I know there are plenty of people out there that may enjoy this sort of game its just not my kinda of game its too repetitive and I dont like the fighting style of the game."
2,...Boring game,Dont buy it please... you will regret. This not a Square-Enix game just logo.Story - not so interestingBattle mode - Difficult and boringGraphic - Good for ps2;_; It was a present for Christmas... I wished have decided for another game at that time.
4,Great ideas...for someone else,"I'm not sure what I was expecting. I loved the personal stories they gave and their ideas are really great. Maybe a little too Martha Stewart for the likes of me, but the ladies in my church could probably do wonders with it."
5,A reworking of a prior disc - but now with 2 CDs,"I was pleased to see that one of my favorite CDs had not really gone out of print, but was reworked into this title and now with a bonus CD. Even though I own the original ""Music from the Age of Discovery 1492"", I'll probably buy this disc just for the extras. Very nice mood music, lots of variety, exotic instruments and lovely voices."
3,Not quite what I expected...,"I was quick to order this when it popped up as a suggested purchase because I love Khatchaturian's music, especially the Masquerade suite, and I love ballets. This ballet was different than what I expected -- it was choreographed and cut rather like a movie -- in fact, it really reminded me of the old Vincent Price movies. The bad thing was, even with the plot described on the back of the box, I still felt lost through large portions of the ballet. I guess I was just kind of disappointed by the choreography -- I expected a little more from this ballet, especially for the price. It was not terrible, but I do not feel it was worth more than $10 or $15, let alone over $30, although most ballets on dvd do sell for about the same price.This ballet has its moments - and some pretty costumes and scenery. Unless you are really into ballets and/or Khatchaturian, though, I would not really recommend this one -- there are much better ballets out there for the price."
4,Not your typical vampire book...,"This was my first book by Richard Laymon, and I found this one to be very entertaining. The whole basis of the novel, whether or not Larry will pull the stake out of Bonnie is almost a second thought compared to the other underlying story with his daughter Lane, and her infatuation with her teacher, Mr. Kramer. I honestly was enthralled with both stories, though I was happy how it ended. I recommend this book to any fan of the genre, it's a new twist on an old theme, and yes, like the others who have reviewed it as well, it will make you stay up late, just to finish ""one more chapter""."
4,God bless Laymon!,"We shall dearly miss this departed master of the macabre. ""The Stake"" is one of his better efforts. There are truely horrific moments where reality itself seems distorted. At his heart, Laymon was a gleefull artisan of ""pulp"" horror. In fact, he was one of the grand masters of the tradition followed by new authors like Harry Shannon (the brilliant 'Night of the Beast') and Brian Keene ('The Rising'). ""The Stake"" is up there with ""The Cellar"" as a solid, fun romp through hormones and horror."
5,Terrific as usual,He was always a fantastic writer and never disappoints. This book keep me on edge to the end. I have read most of his books and this one is one of the best.
4,Sticks like wood in a vampire to your brain!,"What a fun book to read! After reading this, I went out & bought 3 other novels by Laymon. Quick, effective, witty prose & a white knuckled plot that never takes itself too seriously while nearly mocking the vampire craze that was inundated WAY too many writers, The Stake is a one time sitting, if you have a few hours to spare. 2 normal couples find a withered corpse with a stake driven through it & devise a plan to write a book about their ""vampire"", all the while, half joking about people actually believing in them. Read all you can of this man!"
2,Beautiful designs but no instructions,"I love the variety in block designs, however, I'm not all that ingenious with calculations to figure out what I need for a 12inch finished piece. I'll eventually figure out how to make some of my favorites-with trial and error I'm sure- Instructions would save me a lot of time and fabric. In all I'm sure there are better books out there for someone like me who's not a math wiz."
4,Still Remember This From the 70s....,"I loved THE GHOST NEXT DOOR in grade school, and it is dated, but it's still a pretty good supernatural children's book, nonetheless.Twelve-year-old Lindsey Morrow lives near Atlanta, where the houses are surrounded by large, wooded lots and many of the neighbors are doctors of one kind or another. She and her best friend, Tammy, begin to investigate when strange things occur around Sherry Alston - a visiting niece of their next-door neighbor. Is Sherry really communicating with the spirit of her sister who drowned in the pond thirteen years ago? Finding the owl with love in its eyes will lead to the answer."
5,This story has stayed with me for 30 years....,"I too read this as a young child - maybe 8 or so. We've just moved into a new home and I KNOW I have this book in one of our boxes, but I haven't found it yet. My son, age 9, was asking me for a really spooky book to read - he thinks Goosebumps books are highly overrated. The first thing I thought of was, ""It's time. It's time to get out The Ghost Next Door.""I remember this book as very clever and spooky - and also quite melancholy. Wonderful, magical writing - perfect for the child who wants a more frightful tale - without adding gore to the mix.This story is great - but it is so hard to find now."
5,I never forgot this book.,"The Ghost Next Door is an unforgetable tale about a girl named Sherry who goes for a first time visit to her Aunt Judith's house. Behind Aunt Judith's house is a pond in which Sherry's half sister Miranda drown. Sherry was never told about Miranda. However, while visiting her Aunt Judith, Sherry develops a friendship with a girl that has a lot in common with Miranda. No one ever seems to see this new friend when she comes to play. Perhaps they just keep missing her, perhaps she's just an imaginary friend, or perhaps this new friend is the ghost of Miranda.It truly is a shame that this book is out of print and hard to find. If you happen across a used copy at a reasonable price, I recommend you purchase it. I read this book when I was around 12 and enjoyed it so much that years later I purchased a used copy online when my daughter was old enough for me to read it to her."
4,"red, red watch","liked the color and size very much. wore it (night i received package) to dinner with a couple girl friends. they wanted to know where i bought it. my best friend wants a black leather one (watch). will probably buy it for her birthday. i REALLY like the rich, red color of mine. thanks!"
2,Inaccurate Representation,"Under Human Achievements, Travel and Exploration, under the North Pole Conquests, the claim of both Dr. Frederick Albert Cook and Rear Adm. Robert Edwin Peary were under subject to proof. The last 25 years in this same book it states, "" The earliest INDISPUTABLE attainment of the North Pole over the sea ice was at 3 p.m.(cst) on April 19, 1968, by Ralph Plaisted(US) and three companions after a 42-day trek in four snowmobiles. Their arrival was independently verified 18 hours later by a US Air Force weather aircraft."" This correction needs to be made. As to why this was not written in correctly, someone did not do their homework. Now I ask, What else was misrepresented???????? Thank You."
5,Just gets Better,"It's truly amazing that there is an artist out there whose work gets better with every release. We're all so used to recording artists writing and releasing records well past their primes, and it's kind of sad to behold. But Jim Thirlwell AKA Foetus improves with each record, and this new, cool, Simon-and-Garfunkel-in-space (with a great rhythm section) EP is no exception. Its just so startlingly original and fun to listen to! For anyone who wonders where all the great new music is, buy this EP and find out."
3,Teach your kid how to ride a bike,"Overall it is a nice book. It contains lots of good information in general for the world of cycling and actually of good life lessons as well. The one thing it seems to be lacking though is the precise detail I was hoping for. I taught my younger 10 year old (at the time) son to ride a mini-motorcycle in a very methodical way, step by step, getting him acclimated as he progressed. This is a book I had hoped would help his older brother teach his 10 year old daughter to ride in much the same way. I hate to say I was quite disappointed in that respect."
1,....a bluff,"...it doesn`t work at all, I bought other from a different retailer (same model) and is working fine. Better check the origin of this cable..."
2,didnt work,No matter how hard i tried this cable didnt work. So i gave up after some time. Its been coupe years but just realized that i could review
4,good book!,"I liked this book. It is written for children without patronizing them, with a good story and lovely illustrations.And I really like that it comes from a publisher other than the corporate giants. I'm tired of them, so something different is welcomed."
5,Beguiles and bewitches,"A delightful fable for children of all ages . Jillian M Curtis brings the genre of simple, yet melodious, story telling from the ancient oral traditions up to date in a way that both charms and delicately etches a wry smile on even the most jaded of palates.Concisely penned , and never patronising in tone, Curtis weaves a captivating charm that belies the fundamental *truth* within the narrative."
5,"The ""Magic"" of ""The Little Prince...""","I just read this book and it is wonderful. It's a story of great messages--having dreams, courage and making the most of your inner strength--but it also has enough action and literal story to keep kids' interest. The illustrations are beautiful and really complement the story--both the literal action and the gently mystical tone of the writing.There is double magic going on here--the magic in the story but also the special magic the author has used to create such a beautiful compelling book. An enthusiastic thumbs up!"
4,A good old fashioned fairy tale,"A good old fashioned fairy taleTo read to little kidsBefore you tuck them in their bedsTo rest their heavy lidsA prince knew one day he'd be kingBut still he wanted moreHe dreamed of magic and of starsAnd miracles galoreHe took his scepter and his crownAnd donned a magic cloakBut as he headed down the laneHe paused when someone spokeA spirit tangled in the brushCaused him to spring to actionHe slashed at branches and at thornsTo her great satisfactionAnd so he helped her home that dayAnd proved that he was strongThis book is inspirationalThough it's not very longThe other thing worth mentioningShould be the illustrationsTurning each page will bring to lifeAll the author's creationsSo if you come across this bookWhy not give it a shot?Chances are your younger kidsWill like this one a lotAmanda Richards, February 3, 2007"
3,Could have been much better.,"This is an exorcist parody that almost fell completly flat. For starters Linda Blair is terribly corny and lame in this movie. And the plotline seems very scattered. I think they should have gone with a more straight forward parody of the exorcist. They tried too much to put their own spin on the concept. Besides that to rise it up to two stars rather than one it does have some mildly funny gags. And to rise it up to three stars Leslie Nielson puts on a good performance. Though not nearly as good as his much better movies such as the naked gun series. But better than say, 2001 A Space Travesty."
3,Ok when new - now fried!!!,"This drive was a very good purchase 10 months ago and has been reliable up until a couple of months ago. My computer (Dell Desktop, with 3.4 ghz, 1 GB Ram, Windows XP hooked up well with the drive. The drive has always been rather noisy with it's humming, but 2 months ago the drive began to knock and click now and again. Earlier this week the drive eventually failed after the knocking became frequent. My computer cannot read the drive now and it is officially fried. I suggest finding further reviews from other users before buying this drive as mine may be a one off."
1,false advertising,"Crap Crap Crap, all specs and ads state compatible with win98se, its not and the driver download dosnt work, since win98se cant go on with dsl, you cannot download driver, they include some stupid backup disc, Teac is too cheap to include a driver for win98se, dont waste your money if you need win98se ext hd. email teac for a driver disc and you will never get a response."
5,Written especially for Elvis fans,"Written by Elvis expert Gail Brewer Giorgio, The Elvis Files: Was His Death Faked? is a revealing expose that candidly questions every aspect of the death of Elvis Presley's and the subsequent official investigation, presenting all the reasons and media that have debated whether the rock star's death was faked. The Elvis Files is an intriguing, closely researched, highly recommended account written especially for Elvis fans who want to learn more about the ""King"" in general, as much as they can behind what really happened at the tragic close of Elvis' public career in particular."
1,The Elvis Files: Interesting but a HOAX!,"Don't waste you time unless you like a little ""fiction"".It appears Elvis is dead and recent voice analysis tests were performed at the request of others when the recent DVD Elvis Found Alive"" surfaced. Determined to be a fakeThe same the thing was tested on the Gail Brewer-Giorgio TAPE of an person who ""sounded like"" Elvis. That tape was also cross checked with known Elvis recordings and voice prints and it was also determined to be a fake.At best there was 56% on the voices when you need 85% or better to be an original.Nice try Gail!I wish Elvis were alive too, but you can't lie to the public.The facts are in, maybe you should do a retraction?Feel free to contact me and I will give you the name of the company that did the actual voice analysis.John CarmanFormer U.S. Secret Servicejohn.a.carman@gmail.com"
3,dreaming in place,"The Dreaming Place is a charming gem. It is one of deLint's early works but already shows his potential. The author deftly uses diverse mythologies to create a context which makes the plotline credible and intriguing. The characters are evocative and attractive while their interactions and individual complexities add to the novel's appeal without becoming overdrawn or distracting.Readers familiar with deLint will find little new here but nothing to turn them away. New readers would find The Dreaming Place a good introduction to Charles deLint or urban fantasy in general. As in many of his other books, deLint weaves a complex fabric assimilating strands of mythology and popular culture into a gestalt fabric of beauty and haunting appeal.Overall, a good read and a useful dreamsource."
4,This is a SHORT story people,"This is a delightful SHORT story by CDL. Full of interesting characters with the same sort of style we expect of CDL.This book, originally printed in 1990 with Brian Froud's illustrations, was part of a special project I beleive conceived by Froud and CDL with others. I am very fond of this book and do not agree with folks that this isn't as good as his later work.CDL had already written many novels by the time this book was released it was never intended to be a novel but just a short excusion into the world of Newford.In all honesty I have been more disapointed with his more recent work, it all seems rushed contrived and almost boring in some cases. In fact, much of his new writing is too predictable now whereas this and his other older work is still amazing and new something to truly savor and enjoy."
4,OK,The game is fun and all but there is less than twelve hours of game play! You can play as lots of charecters from the show. But durrying the dark tournament you can only be one person! It ends way too quick. But over all it's a pretty good game.
4,please rent or borrow,"ok, i thought this game was going to be the coolest game on the game boy advance. boy was i wrong!!! this game is the worst game on the game boy advance!!! what was atari thinking??? the levels are all confusing(especialy the castle)and there is no map to help you.the sound is all fuzzy...ish, the replay value isnt that great and it is a real bore walking around pressing the a button all the time(attack button). if you are a yuyu hakusho fan, you would probably enjoy it, otherwise, PLEase BORROW OR RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!!!"
2,Buy only for collection if you're a Yu Yu fanatic,"It's not too much of fun but it does go with the story line in the animation, some of the puzzle gets a bit annoying and it sucks cause you can't use more than 1 character at the same time. But I just buy it for collection only, so if you want to collect Yu Yu stuff, wait till this game is dirt cheap then buy it. I also have the other YuYu Tournament Tactic, now that's a 5 star."
2,Game was too easy,"The game was ok, but..... the fighting was too easy and i beat the game in about 5-6 hours and learned all the attacks and beat the tournament thing where you fight with Genkai in about 27 minutes because i died twice..."
4,I have feeling it will not turn up so well,"Ok, Yu Yu Hakusho is defiantely on of Cartoon Network's good shows. It's Number 11 on my best Cartoon Network, here's my list:1. Cowboy Bebop2. Full Metal Alchemist3. Inuyasha4. Trigun5. Naruto6. Wolf's Rain7. Cased Close8. FLCL9. Dragonball Z10. HamtaroAnyway, the show is good, I think it's going to be some below what we expected, probably how Dragonball Z the legacy Goku turned up. It sold so many simply because of the theme, but the actual game play was what we least expect. Yu Yu Hakusho is an anime sorta like DBZ excpet less streched and different things.* I edited my list so the rankings changed. *"
3,Do we really care what old philosophers have to say?,"The book is quite readable for the layperson. It is historically interesting, especially the interplay of notables of the era. There is too much repetition of the basic philosophic positions of the principals. The philosophy of both men has for the most part been dicarded by modern thinkers. It would be more interesting if the author had spent more space explaining how more latter day thinkers appraise the contributions of Leibniz and Spinoza. On the whole it was good. R Stageman"
5,I learned,"I'm Mvskoke Creek and a traditional stompdancer and medicine taker. However, I am not a medicine man, so the info in this book was very interesting to me. I learned things that I would not have learned otherwise, even at my family grounds. Things like this are not told to anybody except young men that are learning to become medicine makers. It is said that if you speak of things that go on within the Creek culture, you will get very ill. So we only speak generally about our traditions on a ""need to know"" basis. I feel that this belief is what is killing my culture. I'm glad that at least one person was brave enough to write about these things so that I can pass this knowledge down to my son. With this book and the few others like it, I hope that my culture stays around for eternity."
4,The Giver of Breath Speaks,"Over the years, my ties to Muscogie Ways was through neighbors and friends with deep ties to the Creek Baptist Churches. Weighing those testimonies with these, harmonizes their special witness in a a world seeking assimilation of sovereign cultures everywhere."
3,caves of fire and ice,"I like the book.I just didn't relies it was a series.I would recommend that if you read this book, you must getthe entire series."
2,I'm confused...,On my phone it shows an image of a drawing pad. this is for a Shrek game.what is going on here!?
2,LaCrosse Atomic Wall Clock,Clock works well; but outside wireless sensors has never worked. Very disappointing pThe Weather Channel WS-8117CTWC Atomic Digital Wall Clock with Outdoor Temperatureproduct.
2,fell apart,"While it was warm, the comforter fell apart after one washing. We had to get a new comforter after only a month."
3,Somwhat Satisfied,The book is very good for its displays or illustrations but it did not cover some of the problems I experienced.
5,it's all in the formatting...,"The book has one of the greatest visual formats ever. It displays the instructions step by step, just as the computer displays it. Helpful for a beginner and yet not tedious for a more advanced user. This book is highly recommended."
4,interesting,Looks interesting. Haven't tried it yet. You know how it is starting a new exercise program. Pleased with the video
5,CoE - Great Band,I only wish it wasn't such a sad thing - this CD is from the bands last show. I was lucky enough to see them while they were together. This disc is a must have for any CoE fan - it represents one last chance to hear something from these cool guys. Industrial style with meaningful lyrics and two drummers - great music.
5,"Yee Haw, Y'all!","Grab a copy while you can - this quintet of talented musicians fronted by a long-legged Texas Rose will take you around the musical spectrum - from Texas Swing to rock ballad, and everything in between. It's an emotional rollercoaster as well: ""I Want That Man"" is a lusty look at a new love interest, while ""The Embrace"" laments a love gone terribly wrong - to the grave. And in between are some quirky, catchy tunes like ""On a Harley"". Listen to that song and then get on a harley and you'll know exactly what she's talking about. Excellent musicianship abounds on this CD; everyone in the band is a master at the instruments they play. A superb first effort."
3,Too bland to be Diabloesque,"I bought the book thinking that the content would be at the level of the game, but I was sorely mistaken. I thought Knaak failed to reach the level of horror and power the game created. The story was original and interesting, but he really never made it scary. I felt the book was more PG-13, instead of rated-R."
5,Excellent work,"This is a fantastic book to anyone who is into the Diablo PC game series. Richard Knaak does a fantastic job of writing out an original and entertaining story, while making various references to the classes, cities and spells from the game series, in particular Diablo II. The characters are well-developed from beginning to end, done by Knaak extremely well, by giving details of the characters lives, but not so much that we end up knowing more about the characters than we do the story. He does an outstanding job of going from the different character's viewpoints, for instance the swtich from Norrec to General Malevolyn to Kara Nightshadow is almost seamless, which does well to avoid confusion. But I found the story very gripping and didn't find the book boring at any point when I was reading it. So I do think that big fans of the game series will be very pleased with this novel."
4,Diablo: Legacy of Blood,"This book is a great read for people who play the game Diablo or Diablo II. It is full of excitement and adventure. As a child I am not very sure how adults would see this book, but in my opinion, as a Diablo fan, this is one of my favorite books ever! The dangerous parts and sort of scary parts make this book wonderful!"
1,"Like the Author, not the book","Well, I read this book, and I was very disappointed. I enjoy Richard Knaak's Warcraft novels, but this just did not do it for me. I am currently reading his first DragonRealm novel, which is better than this novel was to me. This only goes to show that subject matter can effect how good a story is just as much as the Writer that tells the tale."
1,I started with low expectations and they were met.,"When I read a book based on form of existing popular media, I have low expectations. The authors have to work within a given mythology and to stray too far away from it could lead to dissatisfaction of fans or employers. This book uses the basic framework of the PC game and then plods along to its less than original conclusion. Occasionally the reader's interest is piqued by a clever scene, but the overall effect is one of ""Didn't I read this in a million other fantasy books when I was a kid?"" The Diablo PC game could be a fertile ground for some series, but based on this effort I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the ""good"" book in the series."
1,rubbish,"Absolute waste...of paper of time of words of money. Worst book I have read. It took my all summer to read it. I could never force myself through more than a chapter any given day. And most days I couldnt even pick it up. Some weeks I didnt pick it up. Don't ask why I forced my way through it. it was a chore to read. Nothing made sense. Nothing was logical. Nothing was remotely realistic. Even if it is fantasy where the author makes the rules, they werent evident. Whenever there was a potential problem Knaak reveals to you an invented way to solve the problem. Even this a review is a waste of my time but if I prevent even one person from picking this up at the store then it was worth it. I am baffled at how this book has a 4 star raiting. Garbage.pick up Martin, Hobb or Tolkein if you want good fantasy. or even Rowling"
4,A Wonderful Book Overall,"I found this book had several holes in certain parts of the plot, and some of the dialogues and/or monologues were slightly lengthy. I also decided it wasn't as wide in descriptions as a dictionary, but these were my only real problems. I found the story original, gripping, and unpreceded by itself. It introduced new names, and brought up old ones from the diablo universe. I found this book much worthwhile of a read, and quite light reading."
3,Could be better but a pretty good book!,"This is a entertaining book which thouraly explains the video game. Of course like most cases the video game is better than the book but this is a very well written, but at times slow,very exciting book. I strongly recomend it! If you really want a fabulas series try the Resident Evil books!"
3,Not Great,"An interesting story about a man named Norrec who is trapped inside of a cursed suit of armor, with the exception of the Helmet, formerly owned by a warlord named Bartuc. Many people hear about the armors release from Bartucs tomb and a powerful man named Malevolyn who is in possession of the Helmet decides that is his fate to become Bartucs successor, and that means getting the Armor from Norrec. At times Norrec is in control of the Armor and other times it moves on its own, with Norrec unwillingly being taken along. A Necromancer named Kara takes it upon herself to return the Armor to its home at all cost before Malevolyn becomes a new warlord or Bartuc himself is ressurected and the world is again threatened by him. There is much use of Magic and many swordfights. Also, sometimes people in the story find things out without any explanation of how they came to their knowledge."
2,Beware if you order from deerso,I Purchased a lawnboy from Deerso through amazon online as a birthday gift for a friends mother who had a broken lawnmower. I told the mother and friend it would arrive in a few days as that's what the website said when I checked out. Two weeks went by. It never showed up. Deerso never sent the item and amazon help said that deerso canceled the order and did not notifiy anyone. No phone call. No email. Nothing. They did not tell me or the person it was going to who now has two foot grass and is angry with me. Amazon thought deerso was probably out of stock as they quit selling the particular model I ordered that week. Because of the way the order was canceled it's not possible to give deerso direct feedback as a seller- but beware.
4,beautiful music,I am very happy with my purchase. Exactly what I wanted. I am a medieval re-enactor and learning the music.
5,Stunning!,"You can't categorise the music on this CD. It's much more than a collective ensemble, or a collection of samples, it's a real attempt to head off in a new direction.The samples are nearly all from Finnish sources, expertly linked together by D.J.Slow,with added drum loops or programming from various contributors and bass mainly from Kalle Chydenius. Over all of this floats the wonderful sound of the reeds played by Tapani Rinne. He normally adds soprano sax and bass clarinet though on ""Just a phase"" he plays tenor sax as well.The CD also has some rapping and added keyboards. The overall effect is magnificent. The music tends to the sonorous end of the spectrum, but that's not a criticism. It also gives up more with every listening, having layers of depth that unravel with each play.Finnish jazz may be a difficult concept, but if you're looking for something unusual and rewarding, this, the third ever Finnish Blue Note album, comes highly recommended from here."
3,Ninja Scroll Shirt,"This is a good shirt for a classic anime fan. I like the design layout and print on this shirt. However, it does show some slight wear over time and fade a bit. I had previously owned this same print on a black shirt and it seemed to hold up a little better but this is still a great shirt."
2,Not that great...,"Okay, it's better to have your kids read this than not to read at all. That being said, this books are the equivilent of greasy junk food. I enjoyed RL Stine's Fear Street series when I was in junior high, and I even like reading through my old ones even now. But these, are just dummed down versions. Also, who in the world thought these would be apprpropriate for 4-6 year olds is beyond me. There are much better books, even horror/scary books on the market for your kids. Find some of those and don't let them waste their precious time on these."
5,Boooooooooo,"Thrills and chills in this read............ if your children our into mystery and suspense......... get this book, or any in the series !!"
5,Greatbook,I chose this rating because i like this book. I would reccomend this to children from ages 7 and above.
5,I'll give it a five; enjoyable book.,"R.L. Stine has made 'Welcome to Dead House' a masterpiece because of its suspence, and how he created the pondering plot. Again, he uses imagery to make us actually feel like were in a different world just by reading this book, and that's what makes this book very interesting. The setting he created is really intense because of how dark and bleak he made it. One thing is for sure, is that you'll be reading this all nightlong until you can't even keep your eyes open and unable to concentrate. This is a really good start for the Goosebumps series because it keeps you on your toes a lot. I will reccommend this book to people like myself who like ghost stories, and suspence."
3,I liked this book but I wouldn't say it the best.,I think you should read this book because it was thrilling and suspensful
3,"Fun to look at, but not authoritative","This is a nice book for getting an overview of India and picking out things you might want to do there, which is no small task in a country so large. It's more extensively illustrated than any other India guide I've seen. However, having been to India, I wouldn't want to use this book for the actual trip. It doesn't contain nearly enough detailed information about transportation, lodgings, and places to sleep, and its maps are pretty much useless. For actual travel I recommend the Lonely Planet guides, of which there are several for different parts of India."
5,"As promised, only better!","Seller did everything better than promised--faster, better quality--and even a personal note. What's not to like?"
2,Beautiful but not helpful,"I found this guide to be the same as all DK travel guides - beautiful to look at, but seriously wanting in practical information. It highlights the sights of the ocuntry, using lovely photos and interesting maps, but offers little in the way of serious planning for travel in India. I'm not really disappointed, since I've bought DK guides before, but for real planning, this is not the book. My only major objection is the listing of hotels and accommodations - almost all are high end hotels - not what I am interested in. For serious planning, Lonely Planet and Rough Guide are much more detailed and helpful."
1,Terrible Idea,If you plan on using beating your pads a lot and you value your knees do not buy this product. I've been using them for roller derby and I know a lot of other girls that bought them and they fall apart under pressure. There's not enough support to cushion for falls and the longer you wear them the more they stretch out and fall down.
1,HUGE!!!!,The protection on the front is huge and is so uncomfortable don't buy this. But if you do buy it and don't like it amazon has a very easy return process but we just bought valdez knee guards and very pleased.
4,great choice for roller derby,"They are very comfortable and have a nice snug fit. They don't breath well, so when you sweat they tend to slip a little. My knees haven't felt a single fall though."
3,Liked Schwager interview better ; here is why i did buy,"Most of book is very , very basic;but I figured the Schwager interview was so helpful,couldnt lose much. William Eng books give better bang for buck.Its a keeper for me because of;Info in [a]Chapter on ''Beware of the 10 year track record'',[z]Solomon like comparison cartoon in ''Beware of the 10 year track record''."
2,Moonsand,I didn't care for Moonsand like I thought I would. The kids lose interest in it really easily. It is very messy and I don't think it holds together as easily as it shows on tv.
1,Disappointed,"I thought this product would be great. Had an argument with my 8 year old son about how much more fun Moon Sand looked than play-doh. We bought both and boy was my son right, this stuff is a mess and the consistency is horrible. Now we have Moon Sand everywhere. It's like going to the beach and bringing all the sand home with you.FamilyTreeBooks"
2,Send it back to the moon,"Blech. My son and I were both intrigued by this stuff after seeing the commercial. Luckily I just got a small tub to try first and I hated it. He didn't mind it, but wasn't engaged for very long. Truly, I'd rather just have real sand in the house. The Moon Sand is very hard to clean up and gets all over the place very quickly.The texture is cool at first and fun to squeeze, but it doesn't lend itself to actual building and playing like playdoh does or like a sandbox does. Save your money and pass this one up."
1,Sad that my son wasted his birthday money on this junk,Terrible product. A total mess. Doesn't mold well into any shapes -- not at all like the product packaging or ads suggest.What a dud!
3,Rip off seller,"The product is fine, but I have just experienced my firts computer purchase rip off. I could not find Moon sand locally, so in the press for Christmas, I purchased it off Amazon which had previously provided good competitive pricing. I paid 29.99 for moon sand and just saw it locally in Target for 5.99. I am NOT happy. Avoid the rip off seller. Live and learn."
3,"Engrossing and beautifully written, yet perhaps TOO sad","I was deeply enthralled by the story of a young mother lost in the wilderness, fighting to save herself so she could in turn save her daughter. The images of baby Elisabeth treating the whole ordeal as one big adventure were vivid and wonderfully written. I don't want to give too much away, but this book is gut-wrenchingly, bone-grindingly sad. I would have sobbed out loud had I not been at a playground surrounded by strangers. With all respect to the author, I wish I had never read this book which has left me in a funk. I get the central theme of the story, which is the study of an unbreakable bond between mother and daughter, and after some reflection I suppose it had to be this way. Still, my tender, young mother's heart almost couldn't bear it. Yes, it was very, very good, but you'll be needing two boxes of hankies for this one, and perhaps the counsel of some sympathetic friends!"
5,A gripping tale of survival in Colonial America.,"This gripping story of survival in the wilderness of Colonial America tells of Catherwood, a young wife and mother, who is lost in the forest of Colonial New York with Elisabeth, her baby daughter. Cath and her baby wander in the woods for months, desperately trying to stay alive. I am 13 and enjoyed this book a lot. I would reccomend it to ages 13 and up."
1,not my favorite,"""Catherwood"" was recommended to our book group by another book group in town. I found it to be well written, but lacking a plot. It was as if someone found evidence that some woman wondered the woods in the 1600s and was found again, then the author decided to make a story of it. It was depressing and lacked substance. Don't waste your time."
1,dismal,"This book is a fake. It opens at Genesis 11:4 when the real volume begins at Genesis 10. The book is huge with huge print but there are no headings, no sections, not even italics....just large print. The worst book purchase I ever made by far. Sent it back immediately for refund."
4,Well worth it....,"My living room has 9 foot high ceilings and this electric heater does a good job of keeping the room warm.Easy to use, logical controls. Heats a medium sized room well. Takes up little floor space. Ceramic heating element is efficient.The only negative is that it's fairly noisy on the high setting. Overall, I'd say this is a good heater."
2,Safety concerns,"I use this an under the desk heater for my office. It heats satisfactorily in this application, but I have two concerns:First, the device is tall with a small footprint. It is relatively easy to tip over. Unfortunately, unlike other heaters, it lacks a tip-activated off switch. If it falls over, it will continue to run, face-down on the carpet. I worry about fires.Second, the push button controls are not so straightforward to use. A couple of times, I thought that I turned it off and came back the next day to find that I had accidentally left it running overnight.For these reasons, I will be seeking a replacement."
2,Good Heater Bad Smell,Lasko ceramic heaters work well and provide sufficient heat. The only problem I have with them is the smell. Upon turning the unit on the smell was so bad I had to remove it outside. It smelled up the whole house. This smellwill eventually go away when the ceramic heat tubes finally burn off all the oils and the new wares off. Runningit outside for 24 hours really did not help as far as heating the house. Probably would not buy another.
3,I was buying new but got a used item,"I purchased this item as ""new"" and i know it was ""used"" by the wrapping and scratches on the control panal. The remote unit uses two ""aaa"" battery the unit came with two new batteries (wrapped) and there was one battery already in the remote unit (old). Also the package was did not have shipping paperwork attached. return address ofAmazon.com Returns Center172 Trade StreetLexington NY 40511+ I was expecting ""new"" and recieved ""used"" from ILasko 755660 34-Inch Ceramic Tower Heater with Remote Control"
3,"Heats small rooms fairly well, but beeps drive my dog crazy","Product works fairly well. Does best when placed directly in front of area you're going to be sitting in. Haven't yet found a heater that will heat my entire family room - have tried Vornado, oil-filled heaters, etc. This one is at the top of that bunch and isn't all that noisy, however, it beeps when you plug it in, when you turn it off, when you change the temperature, when you change modes. Whenever you touch a button on it, it beeps. And apparently the beep REALLY bugs my dog, so much so that he leaves the room or asks to go outside if he hears it. Thought this might be useful to other people who have noise-neurotic dogs or children. It's a big enough problem for me that I'm looking for a different heater to replace this one."
2,Fire hazard,"I am not happy with this heater because it tipped over and did not shut off. If I had not been home a lot more than the carpet would be burned. If you own this, make sure your fire detector bateries are safe. If you have kids it is sure to be knocked over."
5,Love mine.,I bought two heaters in the event one wasn't performing per my standards.. This one won. So much so that I'm ordering another one. I love mine.
2,Remote control but the display is on top ?? what,This is going to be short sweet and to the point.The heater works well. I have 2 others almost exaclty like it. Except they have larger 2 way remotes with better range and a LCD display. I guess the range isn't that important as the remote on this unit is NOT 2-way so you can't see the temp setting on it or the heater since that one points straight up!So I am returning the unit as it's a pain to use. YOu can't see what the temp setting is without walking over to it. Now this might sound lazy but what purpose is a remote control if you have to walk over to see the settings?
4,Awesome Book review,"I really enjoyed the book ""Legends Of The Martial Arts Master"" by Susan Lynn Peterson. I read the whole book and it was so interesting. This book helped me see the world of martial arts in a different way. Most people think its about kicking people here and there but this book helps you understand that its deeper than. A lot of the stories not only entertain you but they teach you valuable stuff. My favorite story was ""The general fights the bull"" The moral i got from that story was that Your brain can be a very powerful weapon so use it."
4,Legends of the Martial Arts Masters,"In this outstanding book written by Susan Lynn Peterson I learned alot. In this book the storie that caught my attencion the most was ""The hard way to find a teacher"" because I learned that to never judge a person because of their apperance. In this storie a boxer judges a old guy and thinks he could beat him up, but really he can't.Then I thought that this book was very entertaining because I learned many things, so now I look at the world differently. After reading this book I would recommend it, just for the reason that its good and I promise that your going to learn something. This book is the type of book I know you will love so thats why you should read it."
4,Bruce-tall and greasy,"Bruce Spence is apparently pretty good, cause he is different in about any movie I can find with him in it. ""A piece of history"" for sure. I was glad to get this movie in my library."
1,"Yuck! Buy Wonka Runts, Not These..","Don't be fooled by the name, these are NOT the real ""Willy Wonka Runts""And they are horrible tasting and not worth it.We threw all the bags we had out as the kids didn't even like them. Such a waste."
1,Didn't get what was pictured,"The assortment being sold here is not what is pictured. This is a pack of 12, 4.5-ounce bags of the Runts assortment with the pineapple and mango. You don't get the cherry, lime, or blue raspberry. Amazon needs to update their photos, because when the assortment changed this drastically, it created a completely different (and much worse) candy. It's sad that Runts felt they had to destroy the product that made them popular. I've read a comment stating that the new assortments are better than not having Runts at all. I disagree. I'd rather have nothing than have this new assortment, if I have to pay for it.If you're looking for the old assortment that sold so well for decades, don't buy these! If you find that old assortment with the lime and cherry somewhere, let me know. I'll go to great lengths to get more of those, but I wouldn't pay anything for the new assortments."
3,These are okay.,"Good product, but I stepped on them and broke one. I tried to tape it back together but it didn't work very well. Although it's not the product's fault that I stepped on it and broke, you think they'd be a little more durable. I just ordered some wood ones instead, because they are pretty useless now. I mean, I guess I can tape it back together and put it in a pair of boots that I don't wear as often since I won't be taking them in and out as much, but bummer anyway."
5,Worked well,"We bought this to use as table cover for our son's weddind, put white paper down then covered with the burlap. Just the right size. We got lots of compliments on it."
3,okay camera,"I like that the camera is light weight and nice looking. The pictures once taken are nice and the features are good to work with. However, I had a problem with the shutter lag. I point and shoot, but the picture I see when I shoot (if its a moving object or person) is not the picture I get afterwards. There is a definate lag that annoyed me. I returned the camera and I'm looking for another camera. I think I'll try the E900 Fujifilm camera next."
2,Fujifilm finepix A900,"This camera makes everyone look short and fat, turn it sideways and they look tall and skinny, it's very slow cannot stop action at any setting. My old 2.5 MP camera was far better and clearer."
4,Great Deal,"This camera is a great deal at a great price. The options and clarity of this camera are outstanding. The only thing I think it needeed to be a little more clear this does not come with a memory chip so either have one or get one. Also, there is no internal memory on the camera. Overall ""love it."""
3,Good Idea... Needs Work Though,"I bought this item because I own a Sony mp3 player that this item can charge while I'm on the road. I have yet to use that feature because the Sony mp3 player get's 40 hours of playback and has a two-minute quick charge feature that gives me at least three hours of playback on that quick charge. I would have thought that with the extra long receiver cord and the magnetic connection to the frame of the car I would get a pretty strong signal. So far, I've only found a few stations that work. This could be due, however, to conflicting (though weak) FM signals overpowering the transmitter... something to think about on Sony's end...I'm happy to finally have the ability to listen to my podcasts in the car, but I am disappointed in the quality of the reception (albeit only intermittenly poor)."
4,Very good for downloadable books,"I don't listen to music on my MP3, just downloadable books. I live in the New York City metro area, so there are virtually no unused frequencies. I use the weakest signal and generally have no problem hearing the book. Occasionaly there is a little static and once the radio signal broke through and I had to turn the MP3 off. There are areas around here that create loud static even when listening to the radio, so I can't fault the transmitter. I used it down the NJ Turnpike from exit 10 into Delaware and had wonderful reception. I had an analog transmitter which did not work at all. There may be differences in listening to music, though. I am very satisfied and thrilled that I can now listen to my books while in the car."
1,Poor reception,"I have tried this transmitter in 2 different cars. Even on stations with nothing but static, when I'd try to play my mp3 player through the transmitter, I would receive mostly static, with and undertone of barely recognizable music. I live in western Michigan, and have tried this transmitter from Grand Rapids to Lansing...and nowhere was I able to get intelligible reception. This transmitter is NOT worth $5, let alone $50. I will be returning this product."
1,Terrible,I highly recommend you do NOT buy this product! Terrible. It is now sitting in a bin of junk. You would have to live somewhere there is no radio for this thing to work. I tried every channel and configuration available to make this product work with no interference. Maybe you will have better luck. But I would recommend trying another product.
1,Dont buy this guys,"I brought this item couple of weeks back, i have tried with various mp3 but there is no signal at alllllll"
3,Tastes nothing like tea,"I love Lipton's instant fruit teas. I love brewed tea. I do not like THIS tea at all!It is very disappointing. Doesn't taste like tea, doesn't taste like lemonade, doesn't even taste like a bad ""Arnold Palmer."""
5,Excellent basis for a comprehensive education in MATHEMATICS,"This is THE book that I use with my home schooled children for MATHEMATICS. It is well written and has clear and comprehensive coverage. Start at page one and go through the text in order. Highly recommended, and I hope that we will see it back in print soon."
4,A good commericialized taste of Mr. Vasquez,"This was a fun 2 CD set... it contains a lot of commercialized (read: sell-out) stuff that in my opinion is not his best stuff. But nonetheless, it is still a good (happy) compiliation."
2,WHAT I SAY WHAT,"This disk was a total dissappointment to me. I felt like I was at my local club with the same old dj. What was up with that Jr. The records just sounded like they were put on and just played all the way through without any mixing skills. I could even do that for a beginner. The tracks were slammin' but ""WHAT I SAY WHAT"" was that."
1,Awful,"I found this book the be terrible, by far the worst book on cars I've ever come across. Grossly lacking in detail, The A-Z of Cars is anything but. Falls way short in the amount of cars it actually discusses as well."
3,Not fluent in Spanish....-review is Google translation of back cover,"I bought this book in an Ecaudorian bookstore, but the best I can do is provide a Google translation of the back cover(The book as the cover suggests is in Spanish) Here's the translation:The first victim was the religion of modernity, and sociological and philosophical consideration of the phenomenon, Saravia believes he can untangle the web that is locked in the enigma. The silence of God is not only the churches adecta. It is an expression and symptom of pathological processes that affect society and relations between men.Final note, I no longer have this book. Since Amazon lists it as unavailable, if anyone knows where I can get another one, please comment. Thanks!"
3,"Many features, but image quality modest","Good camcorder with lots of bells and whistles for the price, but the image quality was a bit disappointing. Lots of artifacts in the images, and the frame rate seems like it may be less than average, causing any motion to appear jerky, not smooth. Good for outdoor use when well lit conditions exist."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I purchased this for my 9 year old for Christmas. She opened it Christmas morning and took out the tripod - which broke when unfolding it. It is easy to use and makes decent videos, but without purchasing a separate memory card, it is very limited. She uses primarily to create You Tube videos of her stuffed animals, so it works well for that, but I would not recommend it for anyone looking for a quality video camera - good for kids though!"
2,Not for Adults,"I was not all that impressed with this little guy, but I guess you get what you pay for. Buy this for your 10 year old kid, but do not use it yourself or you will not be happy."
1,Another Small Camera With Problems,"I really wanted the little guy to work, but in the end, it went back. A Flip that I returned had a much better picture than this device, but couldn't get the data off of it making it useless, no matter how good the picture was. With this one, it made a clicking sounding while recording with the camcorder aspect of it. So all you heard during play back was a clicking sound along with a VERY poor picture. I didn't expect much for $85 but wasn't worth $20... Someday someone is going to come up with a little camera that works for an affordable price."
4,This is a great camcorder for a beginner,I got this for my 12 year old and she loves it.It works good and does exactly what it says it will do.Easy to handle and priced right for a beginner or a older child.
3,pkt camcorder,"My daughter had wanted one of these forever. But this gift didn't get the reaction I had hoped. She immediately realized that it could only record for about 30 seconds without an additional memory card, and, although I've since purchased that, I've only seen her play with this once or twice. The camcorder itself is realively decent given the low price point compared with purchasing a high end camcorder."
4,Good camera for the price,"I bought this camera for my 15 year old daughter and she says that the camera is easy to use, compact enough to take anywhere and takes great pictures. The video recorder works great, the sound is good and the battery also last for quite a while. It's a cool way to get the video recorder and camera in one product. Overall, a good choice for the value."
4,Aiptek 5900,"I bought this as a replacement for one I had for two and a half years, purchased used. I love the size and handiness, along with the fact that it is powered by two AA batteries, replacements as close as the nearest store for a couple of dollars. With the 1GB card I have been able to record video for more than an hour with one set of batteries. Video can be played directly on the TV. For the price quality is acceptable. I also record church sermons (they save as .wav files)that can be burned to cd. I needed a replacement because the power button was damaged. I still use that unit as a web cam, powered by the usb cable. All other functions till work as long as it is plugged in."
4,Great Little Pocket Camcorder,I bought this Camcorder/Digital Camera for my husband for a Christmas Gift.He used it at his family's Christmas Party and was very excited at the clarity of the pictures. The Camcorder recording was slightly on the dark side. May have been the environment. The review is still out on that aspect. Overall a 4 Star. Cute little produc
5,Aiptek DV5900 Digital Camcorder,"We bought this for our daughter who is 12......she goes 'NOWHERE"" without it! It takes nice pictures, plays music, records like a camcorder. For the price - this thing rocks. It could've easily costed more. My guess is that once the 'proprietary' muckity-mucks get a hold of this - (Apple for instance) it will definitely cose a helluva' lot more soon. Enjoy this product. Nice quality - easy to work with and fun to use. I was thinking of one for myself just to have 'in case of emergency'. Thanks Aiptek!"
2,Not good.,"After maybe two or three videos with this product, it gave out on me. I pressed the button, it stuck and never worked again. No damage or misuse. I didn't expect much, but I was at least expecting it to last a little longer."
3,"It's Ok, but I still use it.","This is my first camera and I use it for still photos and for video. The flash drains the batteries, so try not to use it too often. The sound for the video almost sounds like talking in a can. If the camera is held very still the picture is fine. If room is slightly dark, the camera will not pick up anything in the room. The camera is handy when traveling, but is hard to hold when filming."
2,"don't bother, you'll be disappointed","I saw this camera demonstrated on a shopping channel. I was convinced how well it performed with all these functions. The biggest disappointment and the biggest lie is the advertised ""takes up to 5 mega pixel pictures. I don't think so. The pics look to be no more than 2 mega pixels. If you want a ""toy"" that takes stills, movies, MP3 player and is a digital voice recorder than this is the one for you.. great for your 10 year old daughter."
3,You get what you pay for...,"This camera is perfectly alright if you consider the old saying, ""...you get what you pay for...""I bought this for my teenage son and he loves it. We had none of the incompatibility problems I read about and, while it gives jumpy frame rates during quick motion captures, I am surprised at how good the quality is for an item you can buy for $50 at Circuit City.Parents...unless your kids are unappreciative, professional photographers, this thing is FINE for them."
4,Good product for the price,I bought this for my 8 year old and she loves it. Its easy to use. She and her friends take pictures with it all the time. She has even dropped it a few times and it still works no problem. The pictures and movies aren't great but good enough. I wouldn't get it for my main camera though. Its really more of a toy.
1,Dead after four months,"Lots of great features, great camera for kids.... But after four months of use, this Aipek camera decided that it was done. No damage, never dropped, great condition on the exterior. But something inside is rotten. Buyer beware, you get what you pay for."
1,Piece of junk - doesn't work,"It's cute, sure, but it doesn't work! It's flimsy and didn't work out of the box. I don't recommend it. I'm on the search for one that is reliable."
3,"Annoying, but good for it's purpose.","My family and I use this for cooking and timing other things. the sound of 'tick tick tick' can be annoying, and even more annoying the riiiiiiiing of the timer going off, but it is OK. I mean it serves a great purpose when you are need the 'tick tick tick' to remind you or the riiiiing! But I guess I'll just say that it serves it's purpose. But then it ticks even after it rings and oh....not that great but if you can't find anything else, get it I suppose. It is especially loud to sensitive ears."
2,Product doesn't work,"Product came quickly, and looked exactly as pictured. However, though cute the timer only rings intermittently. Not recommeded."
5,"The greatest book of its kind, more or less.","What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail. As a fan of the 'self-help- genre (they are some of the funniest books around), I feel confident in saying that this book stands out in a densely packed field. While this book is written by a negotiator with 'negotiators' in mind, the lessons he so expertly relates are practical. His methods are useful in every aspect of 'negotiation' from buying a car to getting a date. Starting with No holds a special place on my bookshelf along with Lolita, The Prophet, The 48 Laws of Power, How to Win Friends and Influence People and the Bible. I wish I could meet Mr. Camp. His skill as an author and as a persuasive personality shines through from the other side of the word processor. Buy it and don't look back."
5,Best and most concise negotiating technique period.,"I have read several negotiating books as well as attended the Karras negotiating training with a very good teacher and I learned more from this book than the rest combined. There are natural born negotiators but anyone can learn to be a ""good"" negotiator and this the first, middle and last step I would recommend. Learn the concepts in the book and put them into practice. I have negotiated deals both large and small and time and again it surpises me how simple yet effective the ""start with no"" concept is. Negotiating is a process of communication and if you read this book, your ability to understand what your counterpart is communicating and your ability to communicate will be greatly enhanced."
4,"Camp Throws the High, Hard One","This book is presents a workable high concept view of the negotiation process. The key strengths are in the following themes: emphasis on valid goals and valid agendas, a focus on the needs and pain of the opposite party, and the value of providing the opportunity for your opposite to say ""no."" These concepts alone are worth the price of admission. This is not a step-by-step ""how to"" book - it will not tell you how to deal with the forty or sixty pages of negotiation issues that you might face in a large scale negotiation. It is an effective statement of philosophy; everyone needs such a conceptual starting point to negotiate effectively. One criticism is a missed opportunity: the book might have discussed the link between bad selling and bad negotiation - a great negotiating effort cannot make up for a really poor selling or positioning effort. That said, I recommend the book."
1,Disappointment,I did not enjoy his book. He makes a lot of self contradictions within his thesis. He doesn't consistantly support his theory that a win-win negotiating model is not sufficient within a negotiating scenario.
2,Disappointment,"This is a disappointment. Reading it, one always feels like there is going to be a technique or revelaton around the corner, but it never appears. There is some good stuff about neediness and questions and distinguishing between factors under control and those that are not. It is OK, but I suggest Roger Dawson's books as an adjunct."
2,Preparation for Texas Real Estate Exam,"While this book and several others I read helped me pass the Texas Real Estate Exam, I found several minor and at least one glaring error in this book. Also, the CD that accompanied the book did not load on my Dell Dimension 8250 computer. I tried it on my Dell Inspiron laptop computer and it loaded, but it was very sensitive/unstable, advancing through questions I had not answered."
4,good ideas,i bought this book for my son who is a K-5th grade gym teacher. He said the book had a lot of great ideas for this age group and definitely uses it for ideas when planning his lesson plans.
1,Stale,"The peas are stale in taste and in color while the wasabi coating, though it does taste a bit like wasabi, lacks the hot punch."
2,Too Airy & Sweet...Needs more Crunch,"I tried some wasabi peas placed barside at the Hard Rock, andloved them. Trying to find similiar ones, and this wasn't even close.These had a sweeter taste...and not a dense pea at all withminimal crunch. The search is on!"
4,The Grind is BACK!!,"Angel corpse has surprised me many times, and i had originally only heard parts of it. But after i heard it all. WOW was all I could say. Once again they have surprised me by bringing Grind metal to new heights."
4,a little bit underwhelmed,"while i am certainly enjoying this book, much of it comes across as underwhelming to some degree. i was a little thrown once i realized that much of the book was simply short vignettes; perhaps i was expecting a something more in-depth and informative along the lines of jim mitchell. the grim, stoic, style of writing seems a bit facile and cliche to me at this point in my life, as frequently are the people leduff profiles; at times i even felt vaguely patronized. regardless, i definitely did enjoy the peeks into the lives of people with whom i will probably only get to wonder about, and for that i thank leduff. basically, a light, entertaining book, but more sweet candy than a full meal. i don't think it will be a permanent addition to my book collection, but it made good reading for the train."
3,Limited audience material,"I'm taking back the earlier negative things I said about this book. It's well written, I'll give it credit for that. But the stories here just aren't fun to read. LeDuff interviewed lots of ""everyman"" types; construction workers, gravediggers, and the last muskrat trapper in the city. But he doesn't make any of these guys interesting enough. I lost patience with the book very quickly."
5,still blown away.......!!!!,I wish the creators of this excellent game that I played on my atari many years ago would make it for the playstation 3 it would be kick ass.....with how much computer graphics has evolved in the years and continues...
1,it was very scuffy and not good condition,it is very good watch but this item isnt good seems.the seller didnt tell me these.it was a mistake.u must buy like new or new products.
5,A seminal Jewish thinker,"The great importance of Ahad Ha'am in the Jewish meeting with modernity is that he presented a model of Jewish cultural life which would integrate the Jewish tradition with the best thought and taught in the modern world. Ahad Ha'am dreamed of a true cultural revival of the Jewish people. His essays written with clarity and depth are relevant still today, though the Jewish world may with sadness contemplate how far it has come from realizing his ideal. The ignorance of so many assimilating and assimilated Jews is precisely one of the major evils he hoped to prevent."
3,It's no Shaolin Soccer,If you're looking for a bad B movie to check out with horrible writing this is a nice piece. It's fun to laugh over with some friends and drinks.
4,fantastic premice,"the action was top notch,with lots of suprises thrown in. Nice to see future bright in new action andmartial arts still top quality."
3,A sweet story.,"This is a story of a young woman that sets out to find her runaway charge and meets a gypsy along the way who is searching for the same girl. The two decide to team up, much to Daffyed's chagrin.Most of the book takes place over a two week time period where the h/h follow the trail of young Rosie. Along the way they fall in love.Even though the story was sweet and the hero was fascinating, I found many parts of the story didn't develop well enough. The author started a few plot lines where I wanted to say, ""ok here it comes!"" only to be disappointed in the end.There was virtually no sexual tension and the love scenes were less than scorching. By the end of the first 3/4, the h/h had only kissed twice.Not a keeper for me, but if you don't care much for hot love scenes and sexual tension, this is a great book for you."
3,A disappointment,I own everything she's ever written. Her last three books in this series have been a slight disappointment. This book was actually the best of the three. I actually liked Meg and the Gypsy angle. I liked meeting new family members (hopefully more books are forthcoming). I just think she needs to work provide a more serious plot or problem in the story. The runaway heiress was a little ridiculous.
3,So boring....,"The premise was enticing, prim companion travelling with a half gypsy gentleman but it was totally boring. They are chasing her charge, who has run off with a mysterious man. They blather on and on about if she (the companion) will be comprimised by travelling with a man, and when they stop at his wicked half brother's house they go on and on about if she should stay there or continue on with they gypsy lover, trying to decide which would be less comprimising to her reputation. The scenes in the gypsy camp were interesting but I can't recommend this book."
4,Delightful Read,"This is a charming novel from Layton, one of the best writers of this genre in the business. Her trademark humor keeps the novel moving along nicely, and the characters are interesting and well-developed. The plot could be a little tighter, and it does take Daffyd a bit longer than it should have to come to his senses. With those minor caveats, this is a very nice way to while away an afternoon."
1,JUST BLAND . . .,"I bought this book based on the excellent reviews it was given by theromancereader.com and likesbooks.com, but frankly it took me forever to finish. Usually when I have trouble reading a book it is because the writing is terrible and the story ridiculous. That is not the case with this novel, I have to say that the author writes well and does not underestimate the intelligence of the reader. However, the story just didn't engage my attention. The hero and heroine go on, and on, AND ON about why they are not right for each other while they search for her runaway charge. And that is about all that happens for most of the novel. The sensual tension is almost non-existent and I just felt like I was on an endless road trip with two semi-boring people. This is my first book by this author and I'm not sure I'll try her again. It just was not worth the time and expense. Very dissapointing."
3,"Cute, but geared toward VERY new parents, and not applicable to everyone.","I bought this book as a gift for friends of mine who had recently become parents. I bought it for them once their daughter was about 3 months old, and unfortunately, most of the ""accomplishments"" are geared toward newborns. The book is written to be funny, and it is in spots, but some of the ""accomplishments"" don't apply to all parents. I suppose this is inevitable, though. It might make for a cute shower gift (along with the ""real"" gift you buy.) It doesn't stand alone well."
3,Decent review book for civil service exam,"The book is useful for getting used to the language used in the civil service exams. The most glaring flaw is the lack of explanation of the answers. I would recommend saving your $ and borrowing it from your local library. Our library did not have it, nor did any of the ones in the surrounding area. Surprisingly, they purchased it on my behalf, and I returned it when I was done."
2,Not this one,"You know you're in trouble when the best song on Petty CD, Lucinda Williams' ""Change the Locks,"" is not by Petty. On She's the One the band sounds sedated. There is no energy here, and maybe that's what the movie calls for (The Brothers McMullen is my only Burns movie) but as a stand alone Petty CD it just doesn't work. This band can generally sell even mediocre songs with their enthusiasm, but with lyrics like""California's been good to me, I hope it don't fall into the sea,""what can the band do? By the time some stronger songs come up (""Walls No. 2"" Hurry up and Overdue"") it's too late; the listener's in a coma."
3,decent,"She's the one is a decent work by Tom Petty bot not their best. There are good songs on this album like walls but overall the album falls flat compared to other material by the band. I guess that the music was written to accompany the movie She' the One rather then to fit their own feeling and emotions that marks Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers other material.If you want to get some good stuff from tom petty and the hearbreakers, get something like full mooon fevor or their greatest hits collection."
4,3 3/4 stars--not their best but still decent,"With most Tom Petty albums (with or without the Heartbreakers), I fall in love with at least 90 percent of the tracks. Not the case with this slightly below average effort (for this artist). Tracks such as ""Zero From Outer Space"" are interesting and different (can't say I've ever hear T. P. use the ""f-word"" in one of his songs before). The song ""A**hole"" is also an obvious departure along this vein. On another note, I don't see the point of having two versions of the tracks ""Walls"" and ""Angel Dream"", although both were decent tracks that were singles (I believe). This is a decent overall album that has some strong points-check out, for instance, ""Grew Up Fast"" and ""Hope You Never"", which are vintage Petty tracks. It is just a somewhat mediocre effort for an artist who normally shines start to finish on his albums. His follow up effort ""Echo"" was a return to a stronger overall album. This particular one doesn't quite measure up to many of his other albums."
3,Freezing problems too,"I like almost everything about my Portege, but like one of the other reviewers mine freezes constantly when using IE. You hae to cltr alt delete then mess with it and usually it unfreezes but sometimes I have to hard schut down and restart. A real bummer, since I like and all the other features unique to the convertible alot."
1,nothing but problems,"This computer has been nothing but problems from day 1. This is the second Toshiba tablet pc I have owned. I should have kept my first one. When using IE it froze up. I went online and got a ""fix"" for that but it still happens at least once every time I use it. Programs also freeze up constantly. If I put into hibernate every program that was running freezes and I have to reboot. I think this computer is ready for the junk heap."
4,Great start!,"Not to judge a book by its cover, but I picked this book up at Borders simply because I thought the cover art was cute. After reading this debut book, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Well written story line and plot, Stillings has created characters that I actually care about. Kudos! I look forward to reading more of her work."
3,Critic-ly Good!,"Our leading lady, Betsy, is a critic & editor for a regional newspaper. She's also being stalked by a crazy co-worker and she's in denial about it. Lucky for her, the homicidal lunatic breathing down her neck sent her reviews to Soldier McKennett, author, detective and all round hotty. Though he's dead set on loathing the scathing Betsy, it's love at first sight. And with Soldier on the case to protect Betsy, her chihauau, her brain damaged father, her ecentric mother and her french Dick the story is a corny laugh a minute!"
4,"Cute, funny, sexy, suspenseful.....","I picked this book up at Barnes and Noble, hoping that it would be a good read. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. I like the way the romantic chemistry between Betsy and Soldier came to a head, after they discovered who was who at the conference. Although both characters had self-esteem issues they had to deal with and overcome. The playful banter between them had me laughing until I cried. Suspense-wise, I had a feeling that Betsy was being stalked by someone she knew, but it was oh so nice to have a bodyguard around you 24/7, as handsome and as sexy as Soldier. Believe me, you won't be bored reading this book. Can't wait for the next book by Ms. Stillings."
4,Fun Cd,Great White has done many cover songs throughout their career. They even made an album of Led Zepplin covers. This cd is a compilation of all their cover songs. It rocks. A fun cd.
4,Does the job,"The NorthStar water pump is almost impossible to change without a special tool. With it the job is simple. The tools seem to come in two varieties, flimsy and cheap for use once or twice and solid and expensive for repeated use. This one is among the better built ones but it is still reasonably priced. I did a lot of looking before I bought and this is the one in my tool box."
5,Toast of New Orleans,"I recently watched this video and found it one of the most entertaining that I have recently seen. I had forgotten just how lovely Mario Lanza's voice was, not having heard it very much since the 1950's. The plot was a little weak in parts but mostly amusing with some farcical moments. I loved the way in which Lanza played his character, sometime tough and sometimes vulnerable. The combination of voices was wonderful, and what a treat to hear the arias from various operas. Kathryn Grayson is so pretty and her singing and acting were perfect for the part she played. David Niven was his usual suave self, and suited his part perfectly."
4,Good,This Mario Lanza movie while not my favorite did have a few good scenes. I was disappointed with the choice of music. Considering the talent of both Lanza and Grayson I had expected a great score to show case their abilities and it just didn't happen. Acting was okay but found the story a bit trite. Not up to the standard of this talanted singer.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge
4,Cool Reissue,"Beautiful, wispy, and minimalist melodicism. Stripped down to mostly just guitars (acoustic) and voice, this is a great double album reissue that is an interesting combination of post-punk ideas with a folkish edge. Fans of Young Marble Giants should definitely pick this one up, as they took most of their influence from this other great band."
3,well...it depends.,"This album was released in the early to mid-80s and I had a tape of it that I would listen to as I cruised around in my '73 Mustang convertible. Those, apparantly, were THE days; I had this hippie-chick girlfriend who would would go ""ooohhh, yeahhhh"" to express ""groovin"" but she really wanted to wear pantyhose but, instead, was this alternative Guatamalean-peasant-women: Good, American-imperialist-pig-men: Bad --- but I digress for exposition:The chicks singing on this album are really bad and I have never understood their diction. The songs themselves are amazingly similar and dreamy and acoustic. If I were to make a movie of my pre-marriage days in Chico CA using scanned still images (like Ken Burns in the Civil War), I would use some of this album as audio. It's cool like that. Get me? Memories of doing nothing at the swimmin' hole before HIV really took off.As for honestly listening to it now, without the associations...forget it, I guess. Jeez."
2,"Satisfied My Curiosity, but Not Much Else","I guess you either love these guys or you hate them. My wife finds them incredibly annoying when she hears them on the radio.Myself, I love them. Their accents are not off-putting to me, and I love how they laugh together.What I've learned over time, though, is that the 'straight' answers they provide are actually pretty authoritative. They actually know what they're talking about, based not only on their extensive formal education but also based on their hands-on work with many, many cars.If I personally found anything annoying here, it's only their constant self-referencing which gets old. However, it's a part of their ""shtick"" which we would not want to do without...the rants do not make a lot of sense and reveal more than the reader really wants to know."
4,He's On His Way,"I'm new to Kalan Porter, but a friend has given me his album. What a beautiful musical talent this young man has. His voice has a deeper register than I expected, while his phrasing and use of the rhythm of the subject music further shows his musicality. I love the ballads, while the ""out there"" tracks are probably more for those who love the man himself. It's obvious Kalan is a very perceptive performer and, as he matures, will grow further into his own inimitable style. His career should be watched with great interest."
5,Angel from above.....,"Wow...I wasn't surprised to hear such beautiful music from Kalan he proved he was a winner from the moment he auditioned in B.C. for Canadian Idol...I love all the songs esp how it goes from upbeat rock n roll to soft and soulful ballads. I especially love I don't want to miss u, lucky day and After all it's really tough to say which is best cause I love them all. This is a true Canadian gem I'm so happy he's a Canadian Rocker!! Can't wait for your next album Kalan.."
4,RDR,"Personally I think it is offensive for Theresa fans to come on here and diss the True Colors track in regards that they would prefer to hear her sing the whole song. For me it is the other way. I would rather hear Kalan sing the whole song.I love the CD and think it is a great first effort. I love the mix of songs and think Kalan did a great job in putting a wide array of songs on the CD to satisfy his various fans. Kalan has the uncanny ability to emote with every song he sings. There are some great catchy rock tracks, classical rock violin and ballads. Something for everyone.I do think that the CD is overproduced in some areas. For me the two worst tracks on the CD are Unconditional because of the back track chorus vocals (mixing meyhem) and True Colors.I think Kalan will be a huge star and this CD leaves you wanting to hear his next offering. His 2nd CD is slated for a March/April 2006 release."
1,Very Poor Arrangement,"This is one of the worst CDs I have listened to in a long time. It's too bad because Kalan has a wonderful voice. Too bad it was drowned out most of the time by amateurish drum playing. Except for 2 or 3 tracks, the rest is a wash-out. If this is the best that BMG can produce then I suggest Kalan find another recording company when his contract is up."
1,Dissaponting - Poor Value,"The usefull info contained in this book can be condensed to about 5 pages and can be found on many coyote hunting websites. The rest of the words are there for the reader to stumble over and add volume to the book. In my humble opinion, this work is not worth more than about $5.00 compared to other books of similar price. Gerry Blair's Predator Calling book contains much more information for the same price."
4,kabluey,A women with two annoying brats needs help controlling them until her husband comes back so she asks her out of work brother-in-law to help out.Salman has the most adorable mascot outfit ever. I love the big blue guy. He stands out thier all day trying to hold flyers for a dying internet company. The zipper is in the back and he's able to get it open enough to stick his hand out the bottom and it's funny watching him get soda and numbers from his butt. There are good people in this and packs a fun plot. It's enjoyable and cute. A must see.
5,Favorite movie of all time!,"Thank you, Scott Prendergast, for the best movie EVER! I watched this movie every night when I was up with my newborn daughter. It made me happy. Great movie!"
5,Sweet touching comedy,The film has a simple unpretentious local feel.It felt like a film Buster Keaton might have made.Funny character driven with a wonderful animation coda run beside the credits.
4,A very nice addition to my Chrismas collection!,"The CD covers 19 standard Christmas songs with very pleasant solo piano arrangements. The interpretations are relaxing, but not in the least bit boring, and a couple of the arrangements are just a little bit out there. Rich chords and modern arrangements are used throughout. The recording is very high quality. A great value for 19 carols."

4,Edgar Allan Poe's BURIED ALIVE!,"Robert Vaughn, Donald Pleasense, Karen Witter and John Carradine star in this classic tale of underground terror from the master of horror, Edgar Allan Poe.The story is about an isolated school for troubled teenage girls which was once an asylum for the incurably insane. The school is run by the charistmatic psychiatrist, Gary Julian (Vaughn). . . Captivated by his charm, a young teacher joins the staff. Soon, she is driven to the edge of madness and the school's underground corridors... where a masked killer runs amok, his victims end up being buried alive!Shot in atmospheric locations, eerie acting."
3,Just about great,"This is a good cd. All the songs have something to offer, but about half really catch my interest. It's good enough for your hard earned money though. Production is great, and the technicallity of the songs put them above the run of the mill pop-punk rock bands. At first I thought it was just ok. But then it began to grow on me and now I listen to it all the time."
5,TOOTH AND NAIL DOES IT AGAIN!,"Once again tooth and nail records releases another great cd with Shorthanded's ""Forever Yours."" Shorthanded has had a history with tooth and nail b/c they also released an EP with them last year. This new cd is a lot better than last year's EP though. Forever Yours is a great pop/punk cd with some hard edged punk mixed in too. There is absolutely no weak songs on this cd, but like all other cd's there are some songs that are just better than the rest. On this cd those songs are ""Forever Yours,"" ""Along for the Ride,"" ""Fail You,"" and ""Evil has a Name."" For people who love just about anything by MxPx, Slick Shoes or even Craig's Brother, i highly recommend that you buy Shorthanded's ""Forever Yours"" ASAP!"
4,Handy bucket,"I am using this organizer very often. It is very handy because I can load the proper tools for a specific task and when completed I reload for the next task instead of lugging around a tool box with mixed hard to find tools, the organizer makes it easier to find just the right tool. Very good product, very reasonable price."
3,Much better than a tool box,I bought this for my husband because I kept finding tools all over the house. This works well to keep most of his tools in one place and he can carry it from room to room and easily find what he's looking for. We had no problems fitting it over a Home Depot bucket. It can get a little heavy if there are a lot of tools in it though. The biggest complaint I have is that the material doesn't have any stretch. If something goes too deep into a pocket it's sometimes hard to get out and you can't really squeeze anything into a pocket. It would have been nice to have a few more medium sized pockets.
2,excellent --but!,Have it for the ps3-very glichy game and no support for the ps 3 system.Will not recognize the nox quest finished and help the fellow in the tower quest as well.I have enjoyed it to this point and now it collects dust as I can go no further--very sad.Deck 13 will not respond to my queries or email.Really would have liked to continue so I warn my fellow ps3 owners about this game.You could be very disappointed as I am
1,Blows,"This game absolutely blows. From the cartoony graphics, the loose movement controls, funky camera angles. Absolute junk. There are so many great games on the market right now that I'd suggest spending your money on one of them."
3,RPG game for girls,"This game has got to be the most boring game I have ever played. I have been playing this game for 15 hours which is more than enough time to decide if you like it or not. The graphics are not the best for the ps3 but that isn't the start of it. The story mode isn't interesting at all, you are a female lead character who's lover was killed,now she's on a revenge kick, blah,blah,blah. The battle system is just basic button pushing and rolling out of harms way over and over again. Voice acting is ok but korny.I would rent it before buying it. If you are a girl and like rpg's than you might like."
1,Where the Heart Is,"Very Misleading, I wanted the words not just the music, I loved the movie and thought that was what I was getting were all the great songs. Going to return. Very, Very misleading"
2,Not what I thought it was,"I wanted the music from the Movie. I got THat but only the musical SCORE, not the songs and artist I wanted. VERY MISLEADIING!!!!!!"
2,Magic Harp,These songs are not the multiple harp track gems I remember as a kid. Must be later versions of the songs. I would skip until the real thing comes along.
5,You go girl!,I don't know what some of y'all are complaining about - that girl Tomi from Miami also had a CD out and she was a finalist along with Tarralyn and Towanda. I love this CD and love Tarralyn's powerhouse voice. I hope that the crossover to the mainstream will be worth it for her and I hope she doesn't lose the spiritual message she evokes in her music and replace it with meaningless pop music.
2,"Beautiful voice, Fuzzy theme","As one of Gospel Musics' biggest fans, I would like to commend Tarralyn Ramsey on her beautiful voice and her ability to use it skillfully. But as a devout gospel music lover I feel that her CD doesn't have a theme. It seems that her album is too busy. First you have choir music, then R&B, then something totally unrelated. It's been my experience that if you are trying to drive a point , then you must stick to one subject. I believe that the producers got excited and didn't realize that there needed to be a flow so that the listener could grasp the message that Tarralyn wants to convey. As for her, she is the bomb and I am looking forward to her next project."
4,Let's keep it going,"There is seems to be something in common amongst our little punk/ska community, and that is music means a lot more to us than perhaps others. JFC's new cd is another testament of their creativity, skill, and all around sense of a good time. While they seem to remain today a largly underground band, their talent will soon shine through and find themselves at the top of the game."
1,I do not like being lied to!,"I purchased this product in a retail store. The packaging clearly states it is dishwasher safe. Then after you unpack it, and read that if you put it in the dishwasher you void the ten year warranty! Do not make the same mistake I did, avoid this product."
2,Good tool gone bad,I have owned 3 of these over the past 4 years. I am a home remodeling contractor and the first sander lasted 3 plus years and took much abuse. The second lasted 5 months before the bearings failed and the third just stopped working in the middle of a light duty sanding job. The last 2 sanders were made in China and I'm not sure where the first one was made but something changed for the worse. It's too bad as I love this tool when it works but can't trust it any more. I will send this one back under warranty and use it as a back-up after buying a Porter cable or Dewalt as a primary tool. So much for saving costs by going to China.
2,There are much better sanders,"I bought this after hearing strong reviews and was pretty disappointed. I'd had two Porter Cable sanders that worked well except that the later model has a flimsy dust-catcher that flopped and spewed dust after several uses, which is why I tried the Rigid. This isn't a terrible sander, it just isn't all that great -- not as good as the Porter Cables, and nowhere near as good as the Bosch that I have since purchased, which eats through wood like nobody's business and gives an incredibly smooth surface. To be fair, the sander arrived in like-new condition and my service from CPO Rigid was great, it's just the product that came up short. Instead of this, buy the Bosch for dramatically better results."
1,very used,I was sent 2 sanders neither would hold on to a piece of sand paper. The hook and loop pad was worn out on both and both looked very used.I'll never order reconditioned again.To be fair CPO bent over backwards to make things right.
2,Nice sander when it works.,"Pros:This sander has good value when comparing its specs with other sanders at the same price range. I also like it dust collector / vacuum adapter that takes 1-1/4 and 2-1/2 inches pipes. The lighted plug is a plus.Cons:I haven't tried other RO sanders, but this one seems lacking torque. If I press the sander down, it will spin a lot slower and eventually stops rotating. If a RO sander is a combination of belt sander and a 1/4 Sheet Sander, this sander is more like a 1/4 Sheet Sander.It also have short life span. It die on me after less then 2 months of occational use :("
2,not happy,"I purchaced two of these sanders to use in a small woodshop where we fix furnature etc. they worked really well and seemed a good deal however these sanders are short lived and both sanders are now dead with out even wearing out the first sanding pad . One lasted twice as long as the other but that still wasn't very long. However if you want a good looking sander buy one, just buy a different brand to do work."
3,They are OK.,"I like the cookie dough bites - but I am not fond of the dark chocolate ones though. Unfortunately, I discovered this after I purchased a box and will have them for a LONG time now. Even the kids don't like them. Oh, well. Should have stuck with the original."
3,gloves,These gloves are okay if your not doing hard work in them. I have had them for about 1 month and are all ready ripping. So buy better gloves if you work in these gloves.
1,Smelly,"Although the templates are useful and as pictured, they have a terrible smell. I don' know what it is , they don't smell like plastic- more like old eggs."
4,Story of the House Undivided in the CW-Freemasonry!,Interesting book about Freemasonry during the War Between the States. Well researched. Of interest to the non-Mason as well.
5,Rating of House Undivided: ... a Free Mason Civil War book,"The service was just great -- this book was on the secondary market - rated in excellent condition.When I ordered it, the company contacted me to say they had erred - it was very good condition but did have amark on the cover - they made an appropriate monetary adjustment and shipped the book which arrived in good order.The 3 emails I received from the company were concise, polite and included a name and title of the employee -- justall around good customer service!"
2,Would Not Recommend,"This disk goes with my Bosch Compact continuous shredded. It kind of does juliannes but not really. The large side of the grater that comes with the continuous shredder would do just about the same. If you want real juliannes, do them the old-fashioned way with a knife and cutting board. At least I am glad that I didn't buy the french fry disk, because it probably doesn't do that great, either. I love my Bosch, but machines can only do so much."
5,Shadow Dwellers series rocks!,"I had the rare priviledge of watching this book develop from first draft to electronic print! J.C. Wilder's talent grows with each book in this amazing Shadow Dwellers series. If you love your romance spiced with vampires and other creatures of the night, you'll love this series. --Carolan Ivey, author of BEAUDRY'S GHOST"
1,INSIDIOUS!,"The boorish broad from Baltimore strikes again! What makes this book so insidious is the way that the heroine peppers her pseudo-intellectual do-goodisms with an underlying capitalist mentality. Given her background, she should know better. Shame on you girl!"
3,Dan Sweden,"Nostalgia, lovely to see the movie stars that were so popular when I was young and collected movie stars pictures"
4,"I like, I like.","the material is not as soft as i thought it would be. in fact, it's a little stiff. still, it's very cute and the size small fits just fine on my 34b frame. can't wait for the chance to wear it out; so adorable."
2,"Long on Spirituality, Short on Technique","Ms. Carbonetti is much given to cosmic pronouncements and spiritual ramblings that have little to do with putting paint on paper. She might be forgiven these epic conceits, though, if only she'd spill the beans about exactly how she concocted the appealing pictures in the book. This is not a step-by-step account that might provide practical help to groundlings like me, but a hymnal for an Oriental temple. Bottom line: I like what she does, but I still don't know exactly how she does it."
4,The Tao of Watercolor,"If you've been painting in watercolor and found yourself somewhat bound up by it all, then invest in this book to help free up and get looser with your painting. This isn't a comprehensive how-to book by any means. It doesn't pretend to be. What Jeanne offers in this book are ways to prepare yourself to paint and to unlock your creative spirit with Taoist thought as an easy-to-accept framework. If you don't have one already, get one of the ""complete guide to watercolor"" books and get this one too. It's a good read."
4,The Tao of Watercolor,"Beautiful to look at, lovely to touch and magical to read, The Tao of Watercolor is all this and more.In a mere 112 pages, Ms Carbonetti manges to entertwine aspects of living with aspects of painting. She gives the reader a birds-eye view of how one goes about bridging the gap between play and work, between spontaneous expression and careful decision making.It is important that the painter have had a class or two under their belt to receive the highest benefit from this book.Jeanne Carbonetti includes exercises that help the painter move through the chapters with ease. She gives demos as well as simple explanations of the techniques.Ms. Carbonetti is straight-forward when she describes The Tao of Watercolor as A Revolutionary Approach to the Practice of Painting. Basically the author gives the painter permission to try new ways of painting AND new ways of living our lives.Ths approach may not be for everyone, however what the reader receives is worth purchasing the book."
5,I thought it was wonderful!,I was so inspired by the book I when to a day and half workshop of the authors in Pasadena recently. I loved the book and was quite pleased with the results I was getting with my paintings. I am a visual person and seeing her deomstrate her techniques in person was a very valuable learning experience. I am looking forward to her next book - its on order with Amazon but has not arrived from the publisher as yet.
2,"Long on Spirituality, Short on Technique","Ms. Carbonetti is much given to cosmic pronouncements and spiritual ramblings that have little to do with putting paint on paper. She might be forgiven these epic conceits, though, if only she'd spill the beans about exactly how she concocted the appealing pictures in the book. If she knows how to explain her techniques adequately, she must be saving that intelligence for a forthcoming sequel to this tome. The current work is not a step-by-step account that might provide practical help to groundlings like me, but a hymnal for an Asian temple. Bottom line: I like what she does, but I still don't know exactly how she does it."
3,Not enough instruction but inspirational,A mix of painting and mysticism. While inspirational I would have liked a bit more oN her watercolor techniques and where one can purchase some f the materials.
1,very disappointed ',I loved the paintings in the book and thought there would be instructions on that technique. I would return it but don't want the hassle.
3,Works well.,"When you have an older HP printer and you want it on the network, you need one of these. It works well and I'm happy with it. I'm told they go bad after a while, so I'll buy another one when the time comes."
4,Great price on a common problem solution,"I ordered this JetDirect card for an old HP5100 that keeps burning through these things. The seller shipped super fast and I was up and running within a couple of days. Easy to hook up, just push into the slot and screw down the knobs. It resets the IP address though each time I have to replace this device so that is a small inconvenience. But the users are happy that it's working once again."
3,Thermos,I had a Nissan Thermos stainless steel carry mug for years and years and loved it. It kept my drinks boiling hot for 8 or so hours! This one is good but only keeps the drinks hot for 3-4 hours....then it is all downhill from there. I had hoped it would be more efficient like my old one. It is comforatble to drink out of and is convenient for carrying or using in the car.
5,"Get this book, even if you use OpenOffice Calc!","John Walkenbach is well established as a great spreadsheet mind and is not afraid to share the shortcomings of any software, including Excel 2007. Excel 2007 Formulas continues the tradition of providing, explaining, and demonstrating how formulas work and how you don't have to be intimidated by them. Everything is covered, and I mean everything. And just a note: even if you use StarOffice/OpenOffice Calc, buy this book since almost all the formulas listed transfer seamlessly into the Open Source spreadsheet, too -- a great value, indeed!"
4,A great reference book,"With the recent changes on Excel 2007, in which there were several cosmetic and functional changes, this book is a good option for reference. The author is a real master, no doubt about it, on the CD provided you will see some examples that you would never expected to get out of excel. The only real complaint is in regards to the screen captures on the book, some of them are so POOR quality on resolution that you can hardly see it.However, I would recommend you this book for those interested on developing sound data analysis skills in the application."
2,You can get better,"I was ready to bash this book, but I'll make my review short.I am a veteran advanced excel user. I found some great ideas and problem solvers in this book. HOWEVER, the set up and presentation of the material needs some serious changes. It takes an awful long time to find what you are looking for. There is no real explanation of how to build the formulas. You have to refer to the CD. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather see the formula structure right there on the page. Imagine having to switch from one window to another, back and forth, back and forth, trying to compare the example formula to the one you are trying to create in your own spreadsheet. What a PITA."
4,Excel 2007 Formulas,"I have been a long-time fan of John Walkenbach, and have regularly updated my library of his books as I upgrade to newer versions of Excel. Mr. Walkenbach does a great job of breaking down formulas and techniques to get the job done in Excel. Furthermore, he often provides more than one way to solve a problem - generally starting with a basic straightforward example and then moving to a less-obvious but simpler methodology. Therefore, a novice can quickly resolve an issue, while a more experienced developer can streamline (and speed up) the processing time of a formula.My only complaint about the book (and should be to the embarrassment of the publishers) is that apparently between the preliminary layout and final print, pages were added but the index was not updated. Consequently, sometimes you have to look a few pages forwards or backwards from the index to find what you are looking for. This is not a great testimony to the power of dynamic publishing!"
5,A thorough book.,A thorough book. I thougt I was an expert but this book has related how much I didn't know. Go through each chapter with your laptop and learn. You really need to pay attention while you read.
1,Not for newbies.,"Althought the author is pretty well versed in the use of Excel, it is not much help to those just starting to use the progeam. Written pretty much the same way most Microsoft ""help"" books are written. It assumes you have quite a bit experience with macros and other such ""helpers""."
2,"Professor, check your facts","I didn't know I was in Professor Allen's book until a friend picked it up on Google. I would be wary of factual problems in the book because everything he wrote about me, except the spelling of my name, was wrong.-Kirstie Wilde, former television news reporter and anchor, KGW-TV, Portland; KCST-TV, San Diego; KGTV-TV, San Diego; KRON-TV, San Francisco; WHAS-TV, Louisville; KNBC-TV, Los Angeles; KTTV-TV, Los Angeles; KCBA-TV, Monterey/Salinas, in that order. Also, I wasn't the first female anchor in any of those cities, but I was the first female floor director at KGW-TV, Portland, my first job."
1,More flase prophecy from James Lloyd,"The title of the book ""The False Prophet and the Image of the Beast"" is especially funny, considering that the purported prophecy contained therein is false itself. In the book, James Lloyd names the individual referenced in the book of Revelation as ""the false prophet."" That individual is the now long dead, Pope John Paul II.The book ""The False Prophet and the Image of the Beast,"" is laden with false assertions, conclusionary language, and out of context Biblical references. Also, the book is more of a pamphlet.Save your $5.00 and buy a gallon of gas while you can still get it for that price. This book is poorly researched, poorly presented, and the conclusions are spurious.Other than that, it's a great read."
4,It's for real -- and it's steep!,"In the foreword, the author promises to teach you everything you need to learn to get started in locksmithing -- and he delivers! He describes picking and other bypass strategies for all the major varieties of keyed locks, plus numerous variations. Great for budding locksmiths, curious hobbyists, and people who want to know how that burglar managed to get into their houses.The only complaint I can make about this book is that it's steep reading. Eddie's instructions are very compact -- maybe a little too compact. I can't stand overkill, but I think this may have been underkill. You really have to have an actual lock and tools in front of you in order to follow what he says. Perhaps more text and/or more numerous, better detailed, fully captioned diagrams would help."
3,"Useful text, poor illustrations","The text covers a lot of useful and practical info, and it's worth reading just for that. But, the pictures are very simplistic line drawings that simply don't show enough detail in many cases."
2,Eddie the Wire...POOR book,"I wouldn't get this book.....too expensive for its length, poor illustrations."
4,Good info,Good information and illustrations. The author has lots of experience and understands the challenges facing beginners.
3,Extremely technical,"In fact, it's like a manual for some very complicated electronics. Not very reader-friendly, but after reading it, I was confident I hotbox any thing short of a safe, and even then maybe. Of course, I think the big thing missing from a book like this is practice exercises, which I'm not sure how those would be integrated, but there does come a time when you've got to put it all together. Maybe this guy should sell the book with a series of locks to practice on, which is probably not all that practical as some of those locks cost a pretty penny. Still, can't complain when someone obviously knows what they're talking about, so 3 stars for deep thorough information with two stars taken away for extremely poor writing."
3,A bit unnecessary....,"First off, as a huge Lizzy fan I think its great that Gorham, Sykes and Wharton are touring as Thin Lizzy and playing these songs, mostly because I'm too young to have ever seen Lizzy with Phil Lynott. However, this CD is totally unnecessary--every single one of these tunes is available on Lizzy's other live albums with Phil singing, so unless you're a hardcore Lizzy fan there's NO reason to buy this when you can get the same songs with Phil and Brian Downey playing 'em live--get ""Live & Dangerous"" or, for the John Sykes lineup ""BBC Radio 1 Live In Concert"", which is awesome as well. However, having said that, this is a pretty good CD for what it is--the version of ""The Sun Goes Down"" is great and the playing is tight as you'd expect from Sykes and Gorham, although for some reason Gorham's guitar is mixed WAY too low. Not bad, but really don't bother unless you want to complete your collection."
4,Keeping the 'Lizzy' flame HOT!,"As a long time Thin Lizzy fan ('75), I highly recommend this disc, for it is an excellent example of the way John Sykes (Whitesnake, Blue Murder, Thin Lizzy) has 'taken the torch' from Philip Lynott, and continued the legacy of Thin Lizzy. This is and always will be Philip's band; it must be kept alive, which is what this line-up does! In my opinion, Lizzy has always produced exceptional hard-rock songs and studio recordings, but the band's real statement is in their live shows and recordings ('Live and Dangerous'). Along with long time members Scott Gorham and Darren Wharton and others (Tommy Aldridge, yeah!), the band kicks and Sykes really does deliver the goods. Would Philip be proud? Oh, yeah!"
3,Not to be mistaken for the real thing,"I think most would agree that the man below who said this would be a great introduction to Thin Lizzy is a bit of an insult to Phillip Lynott. I know the reviewer means well but come on, now. This album is a Thin Lizzy tribute and should be called as such. When the guy who wrote most of the songs and sang on all of them as well as being the bass player is dead this would not be a great introduction to his work! There are no original members of Thin Lizzy on this disc! The reviewer who said Scott Gorham was the only original member has forgotten their first 3 albums and Eric Bell. 3 albums is a good chunk of music and the original line up had Bell, Downey and Lynott. This cd sounds real good and Sykes and Gorham are both great but it should be a Thin Lizzy tribute to Phillip Lynott not Thin Lizzy. I think the man, who slipped into a coma, alone on christmas day, 1985, deserves the respect of having the band he named and led retired after he's gone. Thank you."
1,"sadly,this isn't Thin Lizzy","It's sad this group called itself Thin Lizzy,since it would've been a great new band if they had written and recorded original material.It's really a disgrace that a bad without Phil Lynnott and Brian Downey would call itself Thin Lizzy.What's next,a Doors tour without Jim Morrison??"
1,Read carefully NOT the SCORPS!!,"if your a true Scorpians fan you will be bitterly dissapointed with this album. It doesn,t contain a single SCORPS song or band member."
2,Weak,No flow. No building blocks. I have taken programming classes before and never seen it taught like this. It was more like being told about javascript. Each chapter gives you a new subject matter with one example that is totally unrelated to any examples previously covered. I will have to go and by something else to learn with. It does have a nice reference section if you already know the language.
2,Sub Beginners Book,"If you aren't quite up to the level of beginner, this books is for you. The author added a few hundred pages of fluff so that the book would be thick. Other than lack of content the book was well written and would work well in Grade School as a introductory programming book"
3,Does a good job for OO programmers..,"I am 5+ years of c++ Exp. And i have'nt tried out their example scripts. So the star rating is based on that assumption. I think it would not be a good book for programmers without OO background. For those who have OO background, i find this is a quite nice book for step-by-step learning. Not all example scripts are included on disk. Overall this book is well organised and good start for C++ programmers, which many book fail to achieve."
2,"Great Javascript ""Reference"" book...","If you are a programmer in Java or C/C++, this book is perfect. However, the content seemed to be rather vague in it's description of the classes and methods. On the upside, the back of the book contains information that can be used by any programmer to create Javascript with ease"
1,This Book Sucks!!!,"I am pissed off!. I bought this book because I thought it was atutorial on learning javascript. It is not. What it is, is more likesome one talking about javascript. Big deal, I could learn more from reading a magazine article. Now I have to get another book that actually ""teaches you how to use javascript. Know where in the book does is say ""step 1, step2, etc. nor do they have picture example of results. .What a waste of time and money."
1,This book is useless,Useless content and chock full of errors. The only thing that made this book a useful learning tool was tracking down all of the errors and typos. The book is poorly planned and doesn't really teach you anything.
4,what this book realy teaches.,i think that this book is a great book and it helps you realy learn about JavaScript. The problem with this book is it doesn't realy give a real lot of examples and explain how they work. i learned JavaScript mostly from online tutoriols from web pages. END
2,Did Not Like It,The picture showed the tool bag as having a leather hammer loop but it was a metal loop. I didn't care too much for the tool pouch. They don't make a left and a right bag.
4,good,"I love my Bosch mini kitchen mechine and this blender was a nice space saving addition to my small kitchen. It isn't overly powerful but I've successfully made smoothies (I.e. greens, banana, frozen fruit), liver paté and pie filling with it so far. Sometimes I have to stop it to move things around with a spoon but worth it to keep things compact for my limited space. I'm happy with the final results of everything I've blended."
3,Bosch disapointment,"I received the Bosch blender but discovered that it was made for a German machine and not the US one that I own. I have never seen the machine that it fits and doubt that it is available in this country. I am surprised that this piece of equipment is not standardised for any Bosch kitchen machine. At any rate, I sent it back to you, but have not heard if you have received it. Please let me know."
4,Well-Done Collection of B&O Photographs,"This is similar to other reasonably-priced books of railroad photographs published by Kalmbach. The pictures in this large format volume are all black and white, well-printed on slick paper, and feature informative captions. Its content covers the ""heart"" of the B&O's operations in the east - not just the Potomac Valley. The book will be useful to both historians and modelers as the pictures show the physical surroundings of the railroad - not just closeups of locomotives and cars. B&O in the Potomac Valley is recommended for those interested in the B&O, the ""transition era"" from steam to diesel power, and in coal-hauling railroads in general."
4,Great paperback,"A grat paperback on this wonderful railroad and its motive power.Good B&W photos, some caption and map errors but overall a good compilation of the history of this railroad in the Valley"
1,Save Your Money,"The sound quality is very poor. Think of the worst ""big band"" 78 you've ever listened to, and that's what you can expect here. The CD does contain the Panzer Lied, but if you want a rendition that will have you marching in place at your desk, get the sound track from Battle of the Bulge instead. I fully understand that post-war recordings have many technical advantages, but even compared with other CD's featuring original recordings, this one leaves a lot to be desired."
5,Top Quality Phone Holster,"As a long time user of Custom Leathercraft products, I found this item to be up to their usual standards. As a recent convert from the old ""analog bag phone in the truck"" scenario, I was looking for something lightweight to hold my microscopic phone on my belt and yet have no concerns about security. This item fills the bill quite nicely...So much so, in fact, that I purchased several more at a local supply house for family members."
3,A Victorian Mystery Series that is in the cozy genre.,"The Mrs. Jeffries series is a Victorian series, but the books are more in the cozy genre. I find these books quite delightful so far. As long as they're read with the correct genre in mind, you will find them that way too. There is not much Victorian folklore in the books, and not much description of what life was like in England in the 1830's, but the characters are quite wonderful and quite unique. I found the mystery in this particular book a bit simplistic, so that is why a 3 instead of a 4, but I am really enjoying reading the series. In this book Mrs. Jeffries and her crew are drawn into the world of mediums and channeling with people from the other side. Anyway Mrs. J and her intrepid band of amateur sleuths manage to crack the case just in time."
2,Huge disappointment,"Well, it may be not so bad for a newbie, but for a real SR-71 fan it is a waste af time and money. But that happens, when a book is a series book-it is just nice to have a book about Blackbird there. There are two or three excelent things-part of A-12 log written by Kelly himself and articles about SR-71( Kelly) and J-58 ( Mr Brown). The rest is low quality-known facts, to many and to big pictures instead of text. Description of pictures glorify the plane instead of giving sharp technical and historic data!! And what really made me angry. There are several the same photos that appear several times in the book!! And what even worse, the descriptions below these photos say that these are different photos,even when they are not. Book not worth its price. Better buy Paul Crickmore book."
3,shipping damage,"These bits came loose inside the wooden box during shipping and the blades were chipped. So the packing problem was not Amazon's fault but could easily be remedied with a small piece of packing material. I returned the bits for an exact replacement in hopes that the next set will travel better. The box and finish on the bits was not particularly impressive but I will defer judgement until I see how they cut. Some reviewers seem to like these wooden storage boxes but I consider them an unnecessary expense and, as in this case, a hazard to the tool inside. My bits are stored in drawers in my router table so the box is of little utility to me.The second set arrived, also damaged and for the same reason. Returned for a refund. If I could change it, I'd give this item one star. Chipped router bits are useless."
5,Love It,"I have a great watch Seiko and have been wishing to treat myself to a watch.What brand and what price were all concerns I did have. I did not wish fancy so diamonds were out.Brand well, I felt the Seiko I had was working so great, then I saw this watch after wishing etc. I did buyit. I got it from St. Thomas had them take out links which they did. It seems to have a blue face which isa color I love. It does have the added safety that my first seiko did not have. The one fault which is thedate is so tiny, but not a major concern! You really will not go wrong if you get this watch. It is classybut also sporty. I do think all included was 217.00 with link to fit etc., the picture here looks black and my watch is blue and the box in does come in is a pillow etc."
2,"Nice watch, but overall quality is poor.","I really want to love this watch. It looks great, but my issue is that is scuffs and scratches up so easily- definitely not the level of quality I was expecting (especially for this price range). I had been hoping to hold onto it for a long time, but at this rate, I don't expect it to last me very much longer."
2,Time travel later,"I was looking forward to my adventures in travelling through time when I purchased this book. It is presented well. I was a little dissapointed that it lacked the depth I was looking for. It looked like a book report. Like someone wrote a book report with sources off the web. The web addressess are listed at the end of each chapter.As for the cd- Exploring future lives. ""You are getting sleeping very sleepy. You are in a pature, a green pasture. You have a headache, a very bad head ache."" Sorry Stieger.And The little exerpt from commander x seems to be taken from a book called How to Travel to Other Dimensions by Panchadasi. Where by you envision yourself in a control room and proceed to navagate the cosmos. Perhaps you are travelling in a space ship in another dimension. If you are so predispositioned you might go for a ride."
4,Original take on Christmas music,"It was a little short in length, but overall I really enjoyed listening to this CD."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This book replacethe same title I bought many years ago and can't find, and I was VERY glad tom see it available."
5,perfect,"Love it!!! And this requires a set amount of words to submit, i don't know what else to say !!"
5,nice and inexpensive pair of dumbbells,I graduated quickly from the 2 and 3 pound dumbbells and now use this 6 pound set for many exercises. We exercise with DVD's and some of the boot camp DVD's or circuit training ones have us quickly picking up the weights or putting them down quickly to begin the next exercise. These are easy to hang onto with the vinyl coverings. I liked the price of these and they arrived quickly. I bought a 2 pound purple pair to give as a Christmas gift to my 85 year old neighbor and she says they are easy for her to hold. I have been very happy with them.
2,Awful Color!!,"Yes I know that these are just dumbbells and color is not a big deal but I ordered 4 pound sky blue dumbbells and the color looked really bright, glossy and nice on screen. What I actually received in the mail was an ugly grey washed out color. While the dumbbells seem ok in terms of weight and the vinyl covering, the color was all wrong!!! Make sure you get the right pair. I will not be ordering from these people again."
4,Dumbbells,"Overall, these weights have worked fine for me. I really like the fun bright colors. They are durable and well made. Also, unlike some metal and plastic weights they don't make your hands smell funny. My only problem is that the vinyl gets kind of slippery when my hands get sweaty. Next time I will buy less smooth weights so I can get a better grip."
3,Nicely made but it increases the tool footprint too much,"It works fine if you're using this unit with a 'true angle tool' on a flat surface like a drawing board. If you take this to the field and try ro measure say a roof angle with it, forget it. Maybe the Mfgr. or Amazon should explain the proper use of this tool."
5,Double Your Reading Pleasure,"My two favorite subjects--mystery and romance in one book. Jake and Tina capture your heart. They are exciting, genuine, believable and interesting characters. The story line held my interest from the first page to the last, and I never got lost or had to re-read to follow the plot. It is fast moving and fast reading. I was disappointed when I reached the end. Looking forward to more!!!"
5,thorougly enjoyable!,I thoroughly enjoyed this fast paced romance-mystery. Tina and Jake were believeable characters facing a difficult situation realistically. Other family members were easily identified with people we have met. Surprises twists through to the end were fun! The intrigue and steamy romance made the book a page turner and I would love to see the characters on the screen. Perhaps a sequel so we know what becomes of Tina and Jake?
5,Dangerous Lies,"Just finished Dangerous Lies - I became so involved with the characters that I find myself thinking about them and wondering what's next. Is a sequel in the works? This was a terrific read with lots of humor and intrigue, sex and romance, and great, believable characters. I have strongly recommended it to all my friends. Hope to hear more from this new author."
5,It's all there.,"This remarkable book reviews ten years of practical and theoretical advances in the application of hypnosis to psychotherapy. Hypnosis grew enormously in the 1990's and if you are unclear about how to apply hypnotic skills to therapeutic problems, this book is for you. It is clearly written and well organized for the professional practitioner. It is not a self-help book, and it is not ""lightweight."" It is a must-read for practitioners who want to know how to use hypnosis in psychotherapy. It is all there, including clear descriptions of the conceptual underpinnings."
2,Not much here and what's here isn't anything new,"With the plethora of Ocean shows available, this is a total waste of time. Some of it even looks fake! Mostly though its just boring. Get the BBC series Blue Planet or something else but don't waste your hard earned money on this. Netflix or Prime this if you are going to watch it."
1,it's a commercial on compact disk,"This is unquestionably the worst mix I've ever heard, though I'll admit I didn't hear it all the way through - I tossed the cd out my car window after about 15 minutes in. The track listing is deceptive - you get a few notes of each track mixed in with a constant beat. The worst part is that it starts off with a commercial for some radio station in Chicago, and each track after starts off with a cheesy radio voice telling you ""you're listening to Too Cool Chris!"". Not very cool at all."
3,Not exactly chillout music,"I bought this cd under the impression that it would be ""beautiful chill out music (mostly because it says that on the cover). ""Porcelain"" can be desribed that way so I thought the rest would be like that. Well, I didn't know that ""beautiful"" and ""chill-out"" meant techno dance haush-baush. The only redeeming songs are by ""Chicane"". 3 minutes of rain and mumbling? Give me a break! I would have bought a nature cd if that's what I wanted. I guess if you can tune out the constant thump-thump beat and listen to the background keyboard ""atmospheres"" it's not so bad. I guess I'll stick with ""Enigma"" or ""Moodswings"" for beautiful, chillout, ORIGINAL, music. Oh yeah, can anyone make a cool, real chill-out cd with out singing on it?"
1,Extremely disappointed,"Noting ""brief article"" in the title in no way indicates how ridiculously brief this was. I feel totally ripped off to have paid $5.95 for this common sense. I learned nothing new. Do NOT bother with this."
4,Well documented.!!!,"While I have only been able to scan this book so far due to a temporary visual problem, I'm impressed by the documentation used in each essay to show the sources. Considerable research went into the development of this book, and the authors and editor are to be commended for their work.I'm proud to be called one of Jehovah's Witnesses and admire the integrity shown by my brothers and sisters who endured these trials."
1,"Few weapons, little Delta","Outside of a history and background chapter at the beginning, Delta is completely absent from this work. Weapons entries are poorly organized, lacking in details, and have little to do with what Delta is using. Pistols are especially poorly covered. Most of the weapons information would be more appropriate to USSOCOM or even conventional units. No clue why a whole section is devoted to HK weapons that are little or not at all used by US forces. Equipment section is also lacking in detail and more appropriate to USSOCOM than Delta. Support section was added to fill space and covers Army and AF aviation, etc.As a general USSOCOM reference this book might rate a second star, but I would still recommend giving it a pass and looking elsewhere."
2,Part Number is incorrect,"The part number listed is no longer supported...but there is no mention that a replacement part number was going to be sent instead. I was looking for the discontinued part, but received the replacement part (which doesn't work for me)."
5,Soundstation2EX mics work great,"Having already used the SoundstationEX system, I knew what to expect, but I have to say I find this system to be vastly improved over the previous version. The mics pick up great in the conference room and the audio quality is excellent. I will definitely continue to buy this product based on its performance and with the prioing offered by Amazon, I will buy from them as well."
2,karate or barney video,bought this video so my child would practice at home and found it to be a waste of money.It was more like a Barney video than a karate video. Save your money.
1,Food Sticks,"I bought a big set of this calphalon pans and are really disapointed since all food sticks on them, with or without oil, with hi or low temperature... really bad for cooking and specially if you want to cook light."
3,Cute case,Bought this for my daughter as it is pink. Would be nicer if they made larger ds-cases to hold more games and accessories in girly-colors.
3,Good,"This pink case is good because my DS is plain blue when everyone else's is pink DS lite. It also prevents it from damage, and that's cool."
4,I had hopes for this. . .,"On a TV channel that I think is also dead there was a show called Brilliant but canceled. While this show might not be Brilliant, but more like CSI meets Gray's each week the producers took the 3 people watching inside the mind of a patient with problems, but never fear the doctors had their fair share of problems. I'll be honest I NEVER saw this show on broadcast, I was working and didn't have a TV for the few months this show was on, but I did have FREE wi-fi from the city I was working in, and caught this show on Innertube. When I saw it on Amazon.com I decided to test drive my TIVO with it. I have now purchased every episode."
2,"Good idea, but some problems","This works, but the stem does not hold weight well and the unit 'flops' and puts the GPS onto my dashboard. I have to arrange the extension in such a way that it will be properly positioned for visual convenience when it is laying on my dashboard.It's also difficult to get the gps in and out of the unit. It 'snaps' in securely, which can require two handed operation to shove the GPS into the unit. Sometimes such force is required that my passengers (who handle it for me while I drive) are jarring the power cord loose. I know when I'm trying to get the unit out, I feel like I have to practically break the plastic unit to angle the GPS out of the 'snap-in' plastic unit.But with all of this, the concept still works. It adheres to my window and doesn't drop off, the heavy GPS is held tightly and it doesn't jar loose or wiggle around, and I can drive for hours without worrying about the unit. So if you are prepared for the stiff plastic, you'll have a good GPS holder."
3,"Nice songs, tracks divided incorrectly","The sound quality is good and the arrangements are great. Unfortunately, the tracks are delineated incorrectly, so that some of the songs have the first second of the next song at the end of the track, and the next track starts a second in. This is not a problem when listening to the album in order, but listening to individual tracks is bothersome. This seems to be true of both the CD and the downloaded version."
3,usable....almost great...,"I wanted another bag for lunch with a long strap--I ride a motorcycle to work and work in construction. This seemed like a pretty ideal product, at least looking at the pictures. The separate cooler pouch seemed like a good idea, and most of the contents of my usual lunch box do not need to be kept cool, and would probably squish most lunch items.It turns out that the bag is a little too bulky to comfortably carry with the strap slung around one's neck. And the pockets are pretty great, but there ought to be a fairly large interior pocket to put little reference books and papers in. Partly to separate them from potential coffee thermos leaks. I have stuffed tools in the main compartment, but the shoulder strap despite the brass-y hardware does not look like it can hold a whole lot of hardware. The hand straps on either side are sturdily attached, and generally a durable product."
4,Pocket Tote/Cooler Bag,The Pocket Tote/Cooler Bag arriver a few days after I ordered it. Very Prompt! It was NIB as stated. I am using the Tote/Cooler Bag as a console on the bench seat of my pickup truck. Fits perfect and holds alot more than my old console.The smaller compartment of the cooler bag holds the larger bottles and insulates them far better than the standard cup holders.The bag has lots of pockets but they too small inside.If they were to place the same larger pockets that they have on the long exterior side on both sides it would be more driver friendly. Thanks. Corbs
5,An original story,"This is one of the most original vampire novels that I have read with many interesting concepts. A vampire, predator of men, manipulator of minds, is truely a coward at heart? And even though Carnitch has killed thousands, I can't help but feel a little sorry for him and the way the book ended."
5,Feel the wrath of the storm!,"Immortal is by far my most favourite band.No other band can bring the the rage of winterstorms like Immortal.pop in the cd and you will be ravagely taken to a blistering cold unmerciless war in the freezing north. super fast guitar riffings,insane drum fillings, morbid grim vocals, genius war-beckoning lyrics just the right elements for total battles in the north!This is definitely one of their best albums.If i wanted to hear something fast brutal and grim , this album is the first to come in my mind. This is what a band should be , being able to take you places wherever they want you to with their music. It's all about the feel,that is utmost essential.Immortal is a band that will never be forgotten.personal best songs in the album :Batles In The NorthThrough The Halls Of EternityCursed Realms Of The WinterdemonsThroned By BlackstormsGrim And Frostbitten KingdomsCircling Above In Time Before TimeBlashyrkh (Mighty Ravendark)Go get the album now!"
4,Pure Speed,"This is a pretty good release as far as hiper-speed Norwegian Black Metal is concerned. It's a little bit faster than the speed first introduced ..., along with a colder atmosphere and better vocals. The trick is to find the correct time and place to enjoy a CD like this! The speed never let's up until the last song, so it's great for people who like to go 'zoom' in various capacities.The only problem I found with this release is that most of the songs sound the same and it difficult to hear the guitar sometimes.The packaging is great and this is still an essential Immortal release."
4,this cd never lets up,From start to finish this cd rocks. im not a big fan of black metal. (only black metal i own is all immortal and satryicon records). but i know good honest music when i hear it. i love the production on this record. makes this disk all the better. i dont know much about black metal but like i said i know metal when i hear it. should u buy this cd? yeah if you have any musical taste or sense.
3,"Not their best, but still impressive","The third Immortal album is a weak link between Pure Holocaust and Blizzard Beasts. It lacks the wall of sound from PH and the death metal thick guitar sound of BB. Still, it's very fast, creepy, and more than ably evokes the ""Winter"" atmosphere of all Immortal recordings. Down on the list of essential Immortal albums, but a must for completists. Great packaging too."
2,Super Fast Music...Very cold...,"I hate to give IMMORTAL a low rating for something because I love the 3 most recent albums (At The Heart Of Winter / Damned In Black / Sons Of Northern Darkness), but there is nothing really catchy on this album to cling to that would make you want to listen to it repeatedly. Other than the insane speed and similarity of the songs, the guitars lack power because they seem to be in the background. I do admire their talent in being able to play their instruments very well (I especially don't see how Abbath can maintain the speed of those drums!), but the music needed more to keep the listener interested. I probably won't experiment with any more of their releases because this was supposed to be the best of their older stuff. I guess I'll have to stick with what I have and probably sell this one. It's a shame because the cover and photos are pretty cool - I just can't seem to enjoy the music no matter how many times I listen...sorry."
1,No fittings,Very disappointed. Picture makes you think you get an assortment of fittings. Not the case. I will be looking for another kit that includes the fittings.
3,A Different Beegie Adair,"This is not the Beegie Adair I am used to hearing and love so much. This is more like elevator or supermarket music. It sounds like Claderman to me. It is not the intimate piano of her past recordings. I must admit I am quite disappointed in An Affair To Remember,because I wanted the style of her previous recordings. If you like piano music with violins and orchestra, then you will like this."
5,great listening,love this easy listening cd. beejie adair is wonderful. we own several and enjoy them as we drive.
3,Easy listening,"I have a dozen Beegee Adair discs, and think she is fantastic. However, this is not one of my favorites. It is recorded with a full orchestra, which seems intent on providing non-descript background music rather than interesting sounds. The result is rather boring."
3,Does NOT pull straight up!,"I wanted something that would pull my head straight up, in line with the spine. This is worthless for that. As in the picture, this halter will only pull your head at a 45-60 degree angle from vertical, so your head is pulled forward toward your chest as much as it's pulled vertically in line with your spine. It is very much like lying with your head on 3 pillows. And see that black strap that goes around the blue headband? That strap is attached only with Velcro, and the headband is compressed against your ears, so you get to listen to the Velcro crackle like it was on a PA system. I am going to donate this back to my PT, maybe it can serve as a warning to others. It's useless to me."
4,Tracks,"1. Louie, Louie - The Kingsmen2. Wolly Bully / Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs3. Mustang Sally / Maurice Williams4. Leader of the Pack / The Shangri-Las5. La Bamba / José Feliciano6. Tequila / The Champs7. Runaround Sue / Del Shannon8. Rebel Rouser / Duane Eddy9. On the Road Again / Canned Heat10. Bird Doggin' / Gene Vincent11. No Particular Place to Go / Chuck Berry"
5,Great Blues Brothers Accessory!,These ties were the perfect finishing touch for our Blues Brothers costumes this past Halloween. I don't know how they would hold up as an everyday skinny black tie but we can definitely use them again in Halloweens to come!
2,Not a Skinny Tie,"I ordered 3 of these ties from the seller ""Private Island."" Although the description says ""2 inch"" tie, the ties I received were big, fat, 4 inch ties, as measured across near the bottom of the tie. If you're looking for a skinny tie, you might want to check with the seller before you buy. I am returning mine."
2,Miss something at the very beginning,"I was throughly enjoying the Brides of the West series until I got to this book. I am sure the rest of the story would have been great, but I could not get through the beginning for the story began to just tell a different past than what happened before. Such as Dylan was the one to bring the girls from Missouri when actually in Glory it was Jackson. Again it mixed Glory story with Ruth when Patience refer to Ruth shooting an elk and covering her and Dylan with it. It is as if neither Glory's or Ruth's story was told. They blended the two. After that I just was not into the book. The book lost it's appeal. I returned it to store for my money back I may read it sometime in the future but not right now."
5,"Patience, an inspiring story!!!","I was genuinely pleased with the last book of the Brides of the west series. Patience a spunky girl is first kidnapped, then finds a young boy to raise, and buys a mine to work. She is sure there is gold there. During this time the Denver City Sheriff, who has sworn never to love again, helps patience with her mine and in turn she helps him with his heart.Though in the begining of the novel Ms Copeland accidentally confuses two events from prior books, the story is still wonderful and heartwarming. I could not put it down.Patience is an inspiration to me and to us all. I would highly recommend all six of the Brides of the west books!"
2,Need Patience to read this one,"I concur that this is the least enjoyable book of the series. It's the last of the series and a good thing, it appears the author wasn't as spirit lead to write this one, just tried to wrap up the series. Glory's and Ruth's story get mixed up right in the beginning and Copeland doesn't do as well of a job in this love story. I skipped around pages just to get to the end, cause it was almost painful to read. It had the potential to be good, especially from Copeland. the end is a decent attempt to close the ladies stories. because as is evident with this book she was getting tired w/ the series had she tried to write a Mary or Harper story they could have been worse. Although I think a Harper story would be phenomenal, but she ended when it was necessary. leaving it open for at least Lily to show up in her next series."
2,Not as advertised,"I purchased this DVD with the expectation that it would spend the majority of the video going over the Crucible. I was sadly disappointed when they only touched on it for a small portion of the video. Most of it was spent giving me a 10,000 foot overview of what Bootcamp was all about. All the information they provide I had already known due to watching other videos. I was specifically looking for a more indepth video of what the Crucible is.On top of that I was not even impressed with the quality of the video. The editors constantly re-used footage all through out the video.Over all extremely disappointed. Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 only due to the fact that they at least talked about the crucible for a little bit."
1,pathetic,"i have nothing to say for the hero. the heroine was pathetic and the worst kind of doomat. she said sorry enough to the hero for not letting him know about the baby. the hero never said sorry for not reading the letter. i did not get why the heroine had to say she was sorry and look out if the hero was still angry. the heroine always throwing herself at the hero and even after he told her there could not be any future and rejecting her more than once. she did not have any pride and self respect. the hero left her and in a way told her to leave him alone, still she told him she loved him. she never wanted the hero to say he was sorry. in her mind he could not do any wrong. before even being asked in her mind she was ready to say yes to his proposal. she was ready to let him walk all over her."
4,The Real World,"The heroine, Tina, is as intriguing as any notable J. California Cooper character we've ever encountered. Gloria Dunbar, the author, weaves a tale that smacks of ""mother-wits"" virtues. We cry, laugh, and dream with Tina; Bruce, the duckling who becomes a swan; Cassandra, a very wise {""kiss my butt, World""} friend, and a host of other people, and I deem them people_not characters in this ""up all night reading novel""! Folks, you'll love and relate to this wonderful tale."
4,"Very happy with taste, but price went up","My daughter and I have been on a 'wheat free' diet for several years now. WE are thankful for the health benefits that these choices have opened for us. One top food item I've missed the most have been good, crunchy pretzels! These Spelt pretzels fit that niche wonderfully! Wow! The bags are a good size that keep us going for snacks and dipping. They are fantastic!!!I just came back to Amazon to order more and I was shocked at the price change. Only two months ago, I paid just over $2 a bag.... and now it is about $3.60 a bag!!! What's up with that? I suppose then I'll have to look in stores to find a better price. I sure would have ordered more in a heartbeat had I know the prices would change so much.... now I feel like I'm 'back to the drawing board'."
1,More soy crap,"The ingredients listed on Amazon state that Canola oil is used in this product, but when the product arrived it contained Soybean oil. OVER 1 million people in the United States are allergic to Soy and I am one of them."
3,great deal,"I have not found these in health stores n markets i shop... i should have gotten reg pretzels this brand, not sourdough... you can NOT taste sourdough flavor and there is not much salt on them. I was so excited to find them, getting them was a bit of disappointment.... ALSO THE LABEL SAYS: spelt (wheat) which is it, a concern of mine am i eating wheat or spelt pretzels?"
4,Irish Bouquet Flag,"I purchased the garden flag for a gift for some friends. I think the receivers will like it. Personally, it could be a bit more colorful for my taste."
5,A readable and hardwarming book.,Dr. Walz tells the life story of Bill Sackter's triumph over disability. The book is written from Bill's perspective and tells of his journey in a Minnesota mental institution to being named Iowa's Handicapped Person of the year. There is a wonderful Christmas story which makes this book particularly timely. I would recommend this book to readers of all ages.
5,Great PIcture Viewer,Bought this for my daughter's birthday. Loaded pictures from her entire lifetime and from other members of the family. We like it so much that we are planning to purchase one for ourselves.The resolution on this frame is better than several others that we looked at. This is a key point if you are shopping for one of these frames.
2,"NO, NO, Bad product","Eventually I figured out how to load jpg's which is all I wanted to load. The quality of the pictures on the screen are excellent. BUT, after I loaded it I wrapped it as a present and it was opened 4 days later. Guess what ? it wouldn't turn on, the remote didn't work but after many, many trying to turn it on, plugging and unplugging, it finally came on. The remote never worked and after about 4 1/2 months neither did the frame. We fiddled with the off/on switch, plugging and unplugging and finally gave up.Now we're a bit nervous about getting a new frame from any company since this one was a BAD experience. Don't buy this model."
3,Problems with the remote,"The image quality is good, but the remote does not work, making it impossible to gain access to any of the functions. It took three attempts by the customer service person to get it right. In the end they had to send a new frame and remote. (The remotes and frames are manufactured in two different plants in China, and evidently they are paired and packaged in a third facility)"
1,Not for me,I have a pair of these kneepads.....ouch!! The straps cut into the back of my knees so bad that I have to take them off after about 45 min. Buy something else. I wish I could get my money back on these.
5,best kneepads ever,"And I've been thru quite a few. Stay where they're supposed to, with replaceable straps which are almost infinitely adjustable, there is none better."
3,Only Game In Town,I like the idea of this recording but the actual recording is fairly bad. It had too much low end and some distortion. Input levels were probably not set correctly. I'd like to see the people who produced this try again with a better recording engineer. I'll buy it again to get a good sounding carousel organ smoothing through the county air fair. Good luck!
5,Definately one not to miss,The best power pop band you've never heard definately says it all -- don't miss this CD!
4,Good product,"My daughter is obsessed with Diego so what better way to potty-train her? Unfortunately, girl's panties don't come with Diego on them so I ended up getting the boy's underwear for her. She could care less if they're for boys or girls, she keeps her Diego dry and thats all that matters!"
5,Anthology,She has a great voice and it comes through in this cd. I listen to it with great pleasure reminiscing the sites and sounds of the beautiful Mediterranean.
1,"Run, don't walk, away from this horrible book","Run, don't walk away from this book. It's a hodge podge of modern Celtic Wicca, a sprinkle of Faery Wicca and a dash of ornamental magic with some dragon silliness thrown in. There is nothing Druidic about it. While it may contain potent exercises for self actualization, it's disgusting how she steals the word of Druid. She should have stuck to the subtitle - Celtic Faery Craft and Elemental Magic. There is a ridiculous romanticized history essay and while preaching about being open to wisdom, she is yet remarkably derogatory to modern druidry. It's awash in New Age and psychology psychobabble."
4,Nice Work,"There is NO need to run from this book, as one previous reviewer stated. The fact is, there are NO true Druid schools anywhere in the world. All Druid schools make stuff up. We do NOT know what the original Druids actually taught. I've taken courses from the larger Druids schools, and they were peppered with all kinds of New Age ideas and even Eastern Buddhist and Daoist teachings.Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with making things up. If someone has the ability to see into nature, including the human nature, and comprehend what others miss, then, indeed, I want to read their thoughts and insights. There is no doubt, that Amber's books reveal her keen insights into human nature and they are packaged in no less of a Druid container than any of the Druid schools in the world. Thus, in my opinion, this is a great Druid book."
1,Not what I thought,"This book is very misleading.. I bought it on a whim hoping that it would indeed help expand my knowledge of Fairy Craft and Elemental power.. instead what I got was a book that is very drawn out and really does not place much focus on fairy craft... IF you are looking at this for either fairy craft, druidry, or elemental magick.. navigate to another book now.. this one is just not worth it.. Specially seeing as there are far more better works on the topic.."
1,DRUID POWER and ELEMENTAL MAGIC are the same book,DRUID POWER and ELEMENTAL MAGIC are the same book. Shame on you for trying to cheat people. This discredits your personal ethics and makes you look like awful. How do you except people to believe what you write when you pull tricks like this? I just bought both books in good faith thinking one would add illumination to the other. Sick....sick....sick.
3,"This is a ""Charming Small Hotel Guide"" book","I rated this 3 stars only because this page did not note the full title, leading me to beleive this was a tour book. It is a book on small hotels and B&Bs in NE Italy. Nice, but not what I wanted."
5,Wonderful,A truly wonderful book for anyone to reference Irish/Gaelic words and phrases which they come across in many areas of literature. Amazing details.
5,Years of use ... its is awesome,"Had this for a while now and is perfect, especially to watch when on a plane or anytime a table is available instead of holding it. Does add a little bulk but great protection also which is necessary for the hard drive based iPods in my opinion. I have traveleld alot with the same unit and it still works which I am sure is aprtially due to this protective cover/case."
5,What you expect.,"Slightly annoyed by the ""security feature"" perforated release strip intended to make it easier to open and tamper resistant. A plain envelope would have been fine."
2,Rusts easily,"That this tape measure was 'stainless steel' was of interest. I purchased it to measure the depth of water in tanks. Unfortunately the tape proper rusted quickly even though I wiped it dry every time I used it. Presently the plastic scale has de-laminated from the metal tape making the tool useless. Perhaps it would have lasted better if it never got wet. Otherwise, the 'gripper' end face is helpful."
2,How should I put this...,"at first, when i read the beginning i thought it was intriguing and very well written. it kept me on the edge until the middle when i realized i was still waiting for the REAL story to start. the plot was a little undecisive and the main character irritated me. i was waiting for her self esteem to go up but it never came. the end of the book was a great let down and it scared me away from ever reading it again. hardly any of Gypsum's character changed and she remained (in my opinion)as clueless as ever. her family annoyed me and her new found spiritual ""friend"" really scared me. i don't want to give it away to those who still might want to read it, but i want to warn that this book's ending is WEIRD and it grossed me out. i shudder to think of reading this book."
5,Excellent,"Nina Kiriki Hoffman tells a darn good yarn.Gypsum is the only one in her family other than her father, who doesn't have special magic acquired during ""transition"", a transformation everyone else underwent that left them with powers ranging from transfiguration to creating simple enchantments.But one week, when she's 20 (and long after she's given up on getting magic and belonging) the change happens to her and she discovers she has been given the gift of curses. An unexpected and dangerous power to have. Gyp doesn't want to hurt people, but she knows that if she rejects her power, it will kill her. How she will learn to deal with this new part of her without destroying herself and others around her?In a witty, funny and exciting way. You'll love going on a journey with Gyp as she has accidents, victories and experiences bumps along the way to love, acceptance and mastering her power."
5,"Great, Wonderful, Fantastic","You really don't want to put the book down to eat.The author makes magic real and the story and characters are delightful. I borrowed it from the library and read it three times before I was willing to return it.It's what I call a Keeper. One I return to in a month or a year and read again for years on end.There are only a few authors that have some books I consider that good, Mercedes Lackey, David Eddings, Roger Zelazny. It's nice to find another author that is that good."
5,Loved. It.,"I absolutely loved this book. It's poetic, lyrical, and full of hidden meaning. What got me hooked, I'd have to say, was Gypsum's relationship with her mother. The author doesn't draw it out, or dramatize it, she just writes it down, and lets it stand on its own feet. As a character study, it's brilliant, and not usually something you find in a book. Definitely a welcome surprise. I have no idea why this author isn't more prominent. She should be up there with the greats."
4,Not her best but still good.,"I really enjoyed the whimsical pace of this book. I have read several of her other books.This book had everything the last books had except a really good ending. It seemed tojust end. No giant wrap up or possibility of a sequel--just over. I could not put it down which is always the mark of an excellent book. I especially enjoyed the characters. Every member ofher family added to the flavor of this book. If you like her previous books, you will like this one aswell. If this is your first Hoffman book, my recommendation is to keep reading."
4,"Steep price, helps improve performance","This intake kit does help performance, I have a 2008 3.7l dakota, and do notice an increase in power, as well as mileage.First of all, when you open your hood stock, there is a huge baffle the air must pass through before the intake after making it through the restrictive stock air box. This must rob serious power (look inside it from the side opening after removal and you will see what i mean)Installation is a pain in the neck, I'm very competant with tools, and it is still a pain because you are using smaller bolts, and peices you normally don't use on a regular basis.I had an issue where the one bracket installs to hold the tube above the ac line, this is not possible, but did not install this bracket, and have had no issues.I also have a flowmaster cat back 50 series and a throttle body spacer (the one that goes inside the throttle body) and there is a noticable performance and mileage increase"
2,it is very small,Everything has been excellent. But I have been dismiss the watch's dimensions. It is pretty too much but my wife has been like big case.therefore we have disappointed...
1,Boring and bleak. Enslaved's worst.,"Enslaved's album ""Blodhemn"" is a complete failure of the band. It does not offer any new and good songs. Guitars, shrieking vocals and drums are mixed into a full boring noise that will make you yawn and regret.Really, this album has no attractive sides. Well, a very good front cover, but all other things are stupid and dull. I like Viking metal very much, but this ""Blodhemn"" is a disaster. It is not worth listening."
2,Misleading description,"The description says this fits all Bosch machines starting with model number MUM4, but upon arrival I see that the box states it fits machines with model numbers starting with MUM44. Sure enough it does not fit my Bosch MUM4750 machine. Every description I have found on any site has this error. Perhaps Amazon can get theirs corrected."
2,cheese clumps,"I received this product from Bosch as a replacement when the slicer/shredder attachment I have stopped working and they don't make that accessory any longer. Their customer service has been phenomenal each time I have had to contact them. But so far I am not pleased with this item. It works, but the cheese clumps after shredding. I used the medium shredding disc. The cheese got caught in the white plastic support for the shredding disc. It didn't seem to matter what speed I shredded at. Some of it fell down into the bowl, but much of it got caught and therefore clumped together, which defeated the purpose of shredding."
4,Sing along with the Migraines,"Catchy pop rock and roll at its finest. Why this group was never popular,leaves me at wonder. Vocals set the tone for this catchy class of its'own right. Think Screeching Weasel but only better with more catch. The band has a very humorous side and these songs show it. Favorite songs are""Daddy wears mommys things,Im a wuss,Mall hair,Dont wanna grow up,Glad to see you go"". This is a good release."
2,some of the people all of the time,Comparing Dom Minasi to Jim Hall or John McLaughlin is laughable. That is not to dismiss him but rather to distinguish his interesting interpretations from genuine masters of the instrument. Enjoy him but A-B this recording to John Abercrombie or Pat Metheny in their more avant garde outings in order to hear the difference between a player and a pretender.
1,Horrible support!,"It's a pretty piece of hardware and an expensive one at that. Unfortunately, three tickets to their support for just a driver, any driver, even a Beta driver to support Vista and each time they've refused. Vista has been out for nearly a year now and they do not support it at all.Spend your money elsewhere - even Creative does a better job of supporting Vista than Razer does with this card."
2,"Driver troubles, sound woe","I great good technical reviews of this sound card. Apparently, the sound quality and range is very good, and Razer (a company of which I own a few products: mice, keyboard, headphones) tries to take care of their customers. But for the life of me, I could not get this sound care drivers to work without blue screen every time I tried to play a video game or watch a movie file."
4,"Great soundcard, no signed driver for Vista 64 bit","The card has awesome sound. Hearing range extender should be considered a cheat and banned in multiplayer games (I still use it though, hehe)The driver doesn't load in Vista unless I press F8 during boot and turn off Driver Signing Enforcement. I'd give the card 5 stars if they had it resolved.Update: It is resolved but the driver is somewhat buggy, so 4 stars for now"
2,"great card, crippling support","This is a terrific soundcard and should wow anybody looking for high-end audio for gaming. Paired with the HP-1 phones, the surround sound experience is unparalleled. That said, I have real trouble recommending this card to anyone at this time because of the extremely poor support Razer has provided to date. With the understanding that soundcard vendors have been left scrambling with Vista's accelerated rollout, the delay of Vista drivers for this card is now at nearly six months.I can appreciate Razer's need to ensure stability and functionality in their drivers, but after months of false promises, this delay implies to me a general lack of urgency on the part of the vendor. As a result, very difficult for me to recommend either this product or this vendor until they exhibit more interest in getting a functional product to their customer base. It's a shame because the card is outstanding. Purchase with caution, I guess."
4,Razer Barricuda Sound card,"Worked just fine right out of the box. If I have any complaints it isconcerning the color of the speaker connections. The orange and yelloware so similar that it took a while to figure out why I had no soundscoming from the sub-woofer. Once that was straightened out, it has workedperfectly."
2,Another Example of Razer's Poor Quality,"After a buggy Razer Diamondback mouse and 2 pairs of broken Razer surround headphones, I should have known better than to buy this garbage. If Razer put half as much money into QA as they do into marketing, they might last more than just another couple of years."
2,dissapointed,"Razer let me down with this soundcard. When it works its decent. When it doesnt, which is alot more often its just a headache."
1,Bad razer support buggy drivers.,"I bought this product 3 years ago if i remember right,and got rid of it a year later. The product has very bad razer support. Razer doesnt even update the drivers for it any more.I had to use drivers from another company changing the device ID around. I repeating emailing razer about new drivers, even telling them i was gonna sell the card if they didnt update the drivers. They told me they was, then they never did 5 months later.Also the drivers is buggy, you go to make changes and save it. when you reboot the changes isnt saved and you have to re do them again.Then the razer DSP is just a renamed option thats on other cards based on the chipset.You better off with a better card, like a Xonar,Forte etc. then trying to use this pos product with bad driver support."
5,Not overly sweet like most bars,"I have been looking for a health bar that was not so sweet. Most of these bars have so much added sweetener that they lost their appeal for me. I'm under no allusion that these ""health"" bars are good for anyone to lose weight as they are typically loaded with calories. These have a lot less calories than most bars but for me it is the natural sweetness of the fruit that I enjoy.I prefer more nuts than fruit and although I would say this bar tends more to fruit than nuts, I still loved it.In summary* Healthier than most bars* Not too sweet like most bars"
3,Vegan & gluten free with just a little chocolate flavor...,"I bought these for my daughter & her friend who has celiac disease because they're gluten free & a healthy snack. They say these thinkOrganic Chocolate Coconut bars are okay, but not a favorite. I like the texture of these bars but can barely taste the chocolate or coconut. They don't taste sweet but have 13 grams of sugar which can probably be attributed to the dates. There are no sweeteners listed in the ingredients.Calories 160Total Fat 9gSaturated Fat 2.5gTrans Fat, Cholesterol, & Sodium all 0mgPotassium 330mgTotal Carb. 21gDietary Fiber 3gSugars 13gProtein 4gThese are definitely a healthy snack, but need a bit more flavor."
3,"Just ""okay""","I'm afraid we were a bit disappointed in the flavor of these bars. Certainly they are healthy and filling, but there is an after-taste and no coconut flavor to speak of. We just didn't find them to be as tasty as some of the previous reviews would have us expect."
4,"These are great bars, not too coconutty","I really like these bars, though my favorite flavor is the Cherry Nut. Very dense with healthy ingredients. Great bar option. Glad I tried them. :)"
2,"This in no way should be labelled ""Chocolate""","I bought a box of the chocolate-coconut when it was on a lightning deal previously. When I think ""chocolate and coconut"" I think Mounds bar, and that's exactly what this tastes like, if you took a Mounds bar and replaced it with a giant hunk of dirt. This is no way tastes like chocolate. Stay away unless you actually like the taste of carob (which is fine, they just shouldn't call it chocolate), or you're one of those people who think Diet Coke tastes at all like regular Coke, in which case you clearly have no sense of taste anyway, so have at it."
3,hm??? Not so much....,"So were you like me and thought...""yummy...almost like a Almond Joy?""...NOT!!!I should have REALLY looked at the ingredients. These bars are ok, but I'm wondering what I'm going to do with the rest of the box. I really do not want them. I've eaten 3; thinking I would like it better the next time. No...so, do I like them? Hmmm? Not so much...."
5,An excelent book,"When I received this book I didn't imagine its was so complete in exercise physiology. This brings the academic explanations about the topics and research and also explains how to use the information in your favor at the day to day workouts. An excelent purchase, I'm very pleased."
1,Yuck,"If you need it for a textbook required by your school, buy it. Otherwise, I did not find it that great."
5,Possibly Brilliant.,"This isn't my type of music but I can't get enough of it. I don't pretend to understand the Ex-Models' many influences (though Talking Heads, Wire, Gang Of Four come to mind) but I do understand that musically they're off-the-hook creative. Harmonically, rhythmically, social comentarically they're in a league of their own. Their songs are hyper kinetic, always changing, completely and solidly fresh.All tracks scream through the excellent recording, with the possible exception of ""orbital & nuclear,"" which is insturmentally too sparse to be relevant to the subject matter.I can only imagine that this band gives a wicked live show, with head-man Shahin Motia bobbing about like a lunatic David Byrne. Hope to see them in concert some day -- until then I'll be content with playing this LOUD enough to make my ear drums bleed.A definite buy for anyone who loves punk, is a punk, or at one point met a punk."
4,good for beginners,"The last programming language I learned was BASIC, and I wanted to wet my feet in something before I took a Sun certified course in Java. This served very well to pass along some of the fundamental concepts and terminology. The examples worked and with a bit of study and monkeying with the code I was able to figure out why when the text got a bit over my head. I'm no seasoned programmer, but I feel this was a good jolt to get me going."
2,Only Good For Vague Overview,"This is a fine book if you just want to get some idea of what Java is about. But, if you really want to learn and use Java, there are much better books. The title says it all. If you are a complete idiot, then this book is great. But, Java programming is not meant for complete idiots. If you are not a complete idiot and you want to learn Java, choose a book that has better and clearer explanations. The explanations in this book are too vague and brief, to really make it clear how to utilize the language."
2,Will not make you a Java programmer,"How can anyone give 4 or 5 stars to this book?! I read it twice, very carefully. Many critical concepts are just mentioned, not EXPLAINED. This book will not make you a Jave programmer. And it is not good as a reference book either. Actually I don't know what it's good for. I wasted my time, and now I have to order another book. If you goal is getting an overview of what Java is, go for it. But if you want to learn Java, try something else."
1,How to ruin great music,"If amateur orchestras staggering through great music is your thing, then this album will suit you just fine. However, if you'd prefer hearing your favorites played with expertise and emotion, you'd best look elsewhere. It seems clear that this CD's ""musicians,"" for lack of a better word, are too busy concentrating on getting all the notes correct to be able to invest any additional effort into fluidity, style or expression.These limitations are most glaring whenever soloists are featured. Listen to the sample of the ""Carmen"" suite intermezzo (track #3) for a general idea of this album's deficiencies, and then stick a fork in this one, cuz it's RUINED! (zero stars)"
3,Policy writing,This text may be useful for an introductory course in policy and procedures writing but did not meet my expectations.
2,Okay for P&P but not for just Procedure Writing,"This book is fine if you are looking for a guide to create a Policy & Procedure manual where the procedures are at a high level. You should, however, look elsewhere if you are looking for a guide on how to write clear, easy-to-use procedures. The format for the procedures in this book is similar to the technical writing style of 20 years ago and is not suitable for procedures that will actually have to be followed by the end-user. You should look to Nancy J. Campbell's ""Writing Effective Policies and Procedures,"" Blake & Bly's ""The Elements of Technical Writing,"" or an Information Mapping seminar if you are interested in creating ""user-friendly"" procedures."
4,This a very high quality product.,"Bottom line to keep it short and simple:This is a well made tool.You will probably, if you really do need one of these.... need to buy two for it will take two to be really useful.The quality will wow you a bit unless you already have very good quality stuff.The one thing to note is that it requires a good clean square edge to be able to lock onto the side of the work table. If your table has a large radiused corner on the top edges, as mine does, it may require you to place a sheet of plywood on top to grip on.As it shows, the lock down mechanism is blue plastic, but it is well designed and pretty strong stuff.I hope this helps any prospective buyer/user. All the Emerson equipment/tools I have used are very good quality and well made!Enjoy."
2,"Not Easy, not intuitive, must re-read directions with every use, this product will ruin wood not a helpful tool","Sorry this product is not easy to use, not intuitive, you must read & re-read the directions.Not a useful straight edge"
1,bulky and heavy,A saw guide should be light to pick up and easy to store as well as having ease of use. This tool does not have any of the 3 qualities.
1,want to pull your hair out? then buy this...,"at first i was disappointed in the flimsy nature of the product. i figured it should be intuitive and easy to use. not so. it seemed the product was broken as it would not work. so i had to make a long distance call at my expense. there after three attempts, someone told me they had a problem with the product they had not anticipated. they were correcting it by including instructions. so the person told me the 'secret' of how to make this foolish thing work. i followed the cumbersome instructions and got it to -just sort of work. but it is a very awkard procedure and even then sometimes it does work and then again it will just not. this item sure is not worth the money, not worth the hassle, and not worth having to make a toll call. all it is good for i think is as a straight edge...foregoing any plans to have it clamp easily to wood and guide a saw. never would i have bought this ahd i seen it beforehand."
2,Trespassing and Bushwhacking,"This book led me up to Taconic State Park with my family. We followed the very detailed trail directions for a hike labeled as ""Easy for Children"". The trail was reasonably easy to follow at first, but led us through over a mile of land that was regularly posted as private property / no trespassing. But much worse, at the end, the trail simply disappeared. The book mentions that you may have to bushwhack for 100 feet at the end, but we were up to our waists in thorns, unable to see our destination and at least several hundred YARDS from where we needed to go. Definitely not easy to do when you are carrying a three-year-old. In retrospect, we should have verified the trail with the park rangers who would have told us that no such trail exists on park land. In the future, we will not trust this book."
1,Not much original info here,"This seems to be a rehash of the other guidebooks I own. The trails have changed considerably since this book was written, too."
1,Not good quality,"I bought several pieces at the same time and some fared well and others didn't. The ""Salt"" of the Salt & Pepper tarnished and pitted badly but,the Pepper kept its lustre. The square tray also pitted and it looked like the copper had missed spots when it was coated. The oval tray looks beautiful. So, am I just unlucky? Did I get a bad lot?"
1,great if you don't want to put salt in them,"These appear to be exactly what I was looking for, but soon deteriorated BADLY. They get regular but infrequent use and are left on the stovetop per the description. Within 6 months the salt shaker had started to tarnish, rust and discolor from the salt and oil from fingerprints. They would be beautiful- just don't plan on actually using them"
1,copper coated ripoff,These items are not copper but at best a .003 coating. They look good when you get them. After a short period the copper coating wears off and the look like xxxx. Amazon refunded my money. Thanks Amazon but why are they still selling this junk?
5,A great read,"This was a really fun read. What I loved was how, on their first meeting, the hero thinks the heroine has snubbed him. From then on, she's got an uphill battle to win his heart. This author is great with character, has a sense of humor and the romance is steamy. I highly recommend it."
5,MESMERIC & MEDITATIONAL!,"What could be easier than popping the CD into the player, sitting back and relaxing. KRS has a confident soothing voice and the background music helps to keep things calm. For those of us with flying anxieties, FLY WITHOUT FEAR is a great tool to help settle the nerves."
1,Shoe Review,I was very disappointed with the pair of shoes that arrived. They appear used and have a small stain on them. As a result I will not be wearing them or ordering shoes online again. Lesson learned.
4,Great looking bag,"I really love the look of this bag. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it holds quite a bit and has really long straps. The leather is really smooth. Great buy for the money for a designer bag!!"
1,Disappointed,"I requested and it has been confirmed per e-mail that I ordered the Conquering Chemical Dependency - A Christ Centered 12 Step Process (Life Support Group Series), however, I received the leaders guide instead. This is causing a delay in work I need for ministry purposes."
4,Simple but you still need a lot of practice,The book is very intuitive and easy to understand but you still need a ton of practice to be a pro with macros.Overall the book it is pretty good
4,Clarifying,"This book is perfect for the persons that already know quite a bit of Excel and its capabilities, but don't know the programming side of Excel. I will like to add that this book is easy to understand and very user friendly with the practical explanations."
4,I can't program,"What's not to love about the dummies books? Straight-forward and easy to read. This book like most of the others I've read breaks down a complex subject matter, at least for me, and makes it reasonable. Good addition to anyone's library who wants to brush up on Excel programming skills"
3,Not his best but a good read for Cioran addicts,"The essays in this book a pretty random, which is refreshing. About half the book is devoted to aphorisms in the usual Cioran style. Some of the essays include Samuel Becket, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and a 17 century religious fanatic reactionary which Cioran draws dark parallels with. As usual, each essay of criticism and praise gives us a little more shading on the edifice of Cioran's mysterious outlook.A good place to start with Cioran is ""On the Heights of Despair"" or ""The Trouble with Being Born"". His most mature and central work is without a doubt, ""A Brief History of Decay""----all of which deserve 5 stars."
5,Outstanding CD!,"This is an OUTSTANDING CD...very strong vocals and the words are AMAZING! ""No One Ever"" has to be the most beautiful songs I have ever heard! This CD is wonderful...and I would recommend it to everyone!"
3,A book for older children or adults,"I guess I expected this book to be for a younger age, My fault for not looking into it more. My grandson loves cows so the pictures are perfect."
4,A Classic of the Rio Grande !,"A guide to being a ""cow hand"". Inspiring to say the leastwithout spending alot of Moola ..."
5,A book for all seasons,"True, it is written in Appalachia by Appalachians, but it is a universal book about love, tragedy, courage, and seeing blessing in life regardless of circumstance. Not only does the reader see the pure love of the parent for the child, you see the pure love of the child for the parent; a child who finds joy in a parent who could have seen little reason for it himself, but who chose from the deepest resources in his being to continue to live a life that rewarded him and all that he touched. A must read. And you will also enjoy that it is based in the Center of the Appalachians."
5,A MUST Read for Parents,"Jim Taylor has done it again. His latest book, YOUR CHILDREN ARE UNDER ATTACK, is not only a compelling read but also filled with statistics, research and just plain, good sound advice that tells us today's culture is toxic for our children's moral growth. But what makes Taylor's book especially profound is that he offers doable ways to help parents take back the control of our children's lives and make sure we do plant the kinds of values that will help them become compassionate, humane, and ethical individuals (despite the popular culture). I highly recommend this book (as well as the author's previous work, Positive Pushing). Bothshould be on every parents' nightstands these days."
4,Joseph Campbell and spiritual development,Michael Toms' conversation with Joseph Campbell holds up well and provides a wide-ranging exploration of Campbell's evolving views on spirituality and development. Campbell was truly a remarkable and extraordinary human being who followed his bliss all his life and was willing to share his insights.This title is a classic for anyone who has any interest in Joseph Campbell's work.
4,BULLET!,"I love this cd! It's been in the cd player of my car since I bought it three weeks ago and I play it at some point every day. I think Mavado has a lot of potential to ""rise and buss"". He has a unique quality to his voice and a cool way of flipping words.It almost seems to me that he was good on this cd without really even trying. Imagine if he went all out. The ""gangsta for life"" line was used so much that it loses some of its intended effect in my opinion.I hope when Mavado develops his craft more he will sing a little more. There's something heartfelt in his voice that I would like to hear more of. Maybe he could become the Jamaican Jaheim (but hopefully more successful).Peace"
5,Movado old CD'S,I am trying to find some of Movado's old CD'S but I have not been able to find them online. Any suggestions anyone?JT
5,562 pages of Delicious Crimes and Assorted Felonies and Transgressions,"562pp. anthology of 32 crook stories Stories by Dashiell Hammett Ruffian's Wife [ Guy Tharp] Agatha Christie Accident [ Mrs Merrowdene] H C Bailey Mr Bowley's Sunday Evening [ Simon Bowley] E W Hornung A Trap To catch A Cracksman [ A J Raffles] Melville Davisson Post The Men of The Jimmy [ Randolph Mason] and also by Leslie Charteris, Ben Hecht, Dorothy Sayers, John Dickson Carr, Allen, LeBlanc, Anderson, Wallace, R. Austin Freeman, Hodgson, and Johnston McCulley (my favorite story)Ellery Queen wrote the Introduction to each criminal. And also wrote 4 ""Betweenwords"" and an ""Afterword."" The material wrote by Ellery Queen could be published alone as an interesting book."
2,Enhanced and New? I don't believe in either,"The buyer's description of this CD states that it's ""Enhanced"". My question is, From what? For this, I consider the seller blatantly dishonest, and I've been trapped in the his advertising BS. Also, when I bought it, it wasn't advertised as used, but surely that's what the packaging says. For $6 the return is not worth the hassle, and I must say it lives up to the label that indicates it ""new like new"". So the seller scalped $3 additional from me, but will get negative feedback that spills out to the quality of this recording. Compared to the recording of Gratitud, this work melts. It contains no stage depth, very boringly flat. I have an earlier version, a normal one, and I tell no difference. Love the material, but can't stand the recording. Suggest Fonseca have it remastered."
1,An awful introduction to philosophical argument in China.,"I had high expectations for this book. However it's language and syntax is horrible. The language is heavy, boring and badly written. One should not think that something like this would be given out by any publisher.(Hopefully a better book on philosophical in ancient china will be written soon)The author also tends to quote throughout an amount of sites, but without any good explanations or lack of any explanations at all this is totally useless. And if you are beginner to philosophical argument in China you are ought to lay of this book. Graham writes about things extremely more heavyily and complex than they really are. So my advice is to searh for another book. You will spare both time, frustration and money.This book gives the history of China a bad name."
2,Skill Level Titles Misleading,"I agree with the other reviews about the layout of this book. The perforated pages are great, and the boxes are nice and big.That said, if you've been doing Sudoku puzzles for any longer than a month or so and are looking for challenging puzzles, this is NOT the book for you. I found the toughest level, ""Migraine"" to be so easy that I don't even have to fill in the temporary guesses most of the time, and I almost never have to erase! I would rate the ""Migraine"" level puzzles at possibly ""Tricky"", but honestly, more at ""Painless"".I was overall disappointed with this book. For a more challenging Sudoku book, try,Sudoku : More than 200 Fun and Challenging Japanese Number Puzzles, by Tammy Seto."
2,Very Cheap,"I read the reviews on this and thought ""OK it's a little flimsy"" but wow, the arms are about as thick as 4 sheets of regular paper. The protractor arms droop under their own weight. This protractor seems practical only for use on a desk and given the exceedingly light construction, hardly worth more than a couple of dollars."
3,12 true angle tool,I used this for about a dozen corners and it does the job and the price is right. I think one with longer legs would be better.
5,ooooooohhhhhhh,"In Stay Out Of The Basement, a girl's scientific father has been acting very strangely lately. She thinks that he might be half man and half plant. He has been working on an experiment for a very long time. His daughter wants to know what he is up to,so she goes into the basement to the lab and discovers that her Father's clone,who is made of plants,trapped her real dad in the closet. She couldn't tell which was which. Will she destroy her own father? Read the book and find out."
4,It is pretty good!!,"It is about a girl named Margeret. Her dad never has time for fun. Then she and her friend, go into the basement, her dad is on the steps. He screamed a warning: STAY OUT OF THE BASEMENT!! Then they go in the next. Day. Their dad is captured by his evil twin that is a plant, will Margeret find which is the real dad? she chooses. Then the next day, a flower below her skueaked:I AM YOUR real DAD!"
3,My Review,"The name of my book is STAY OUT OF THE BASEMENT.The charater name in my are:the father(Dr.Berwer),the mother(Mrs.Berwer), there kids Casey,and Margaret.The mother go's to the hospital for her sister. The dad get fry for experriments. He stay in basement so he makes a plant copy of his self.And the plant copy locks his the real dad in the closet.The pl,ant copy come home and tells the kids that he is going to get the mom from the hospital.So kds go down in to the basement and finds the real dad in ths supply closet. He starts to tell the kids the true about everything. The get home and get the motherinto the basement and kids are in there the two dad get face to face the kids cut both dads with a axe and fells and Margaret could see the one that fell was stem.That's the end.I thing everyone my age should read this book because it a good book to read."
1,Stay Out Of The Basement,"This book in my mind was horrible, I do not think there was even one point in the book, were there was any excitement.This book was about a pare of children (brother and sister), who's father is a plant scientist. One day, there father was down in there basement for hour, trying to fulfill some kind of experiment. When he came up, he seemed changed, a little rude. There Mom had gone on a business trip the day after, that's when things started to become weird. There father was trying to feed them plant food! Ewww! So they went down in to the basement while there father was asleep. What they found I cannot tell you......"
5,Enjoyable,"This book is good for childrens imaginations. They're not frightning, but they're full of suspence and mystory. I still own the entire goosebumps series that i had from my fourth grade year"
5,it was great!!!,I collect goosebumps books. I find that most of them are very good.My favorite one is Werewolf of the fever swamp (#14).But this is my second favorite one.I highley reccomed it.
4,It was a thrilling and intreaging book.,The best part was when they found the worms in the bed. We reccomend this book to people who like horror.
5,great,"This is a great cooler bag for the beach, it holds a lot and we love the top opening for easy access."
1,Nice size but doesn't work,My husband needed a larger lunch box for his long days at work. This was a great size but does not keep food cold and the zipper is designed poorly so that it sticks near the ring of the strap. Not worth the money.
5,Just the right size,Bought this cooler for my husband and I need to get him something that would withstand the harsh conditions of a construction work site. First off you can choose to use the handles to carry it or the removable shoulder strap. The velcro flip up lid is large enough for a mans hand to fit through and reseals tightly. The construction of the cooler seems durable and in the month my husband's been using it it hasn't leaked once.
3,"Ok, but NOT waterproof!","It's long and narrow, and it works ok. It isn't waterproof as we found out the hard way. It isn't bad, however, I think a waterproof one that isn't so long and narrow would have worked better for my family."
1,Item not as described online,"I bought this cooler based on the size indicated in the description of the item. The title has since been changed after I returned the item. When I bought it the description in the body said it was 17 inches, not 14. I need a larger cooler so snapped it up. Was very disappointed when it arrived and it was so small. I started the return process and, as always, Amazon came through and gave me a full refund and even paid for the shipping since there was a discrepancy on the web page. I love Amazon, such a great company to do business with."
2,Much too small,The product is very strong and nice looking but I find it much too small. It looks bigger in the picture. I will try to see how much I can fit in it when I go to the beach and re-review this item.
4,Great Little Cooler,"This is a great product. Light weight, well made, durable. I love it!I recommend this cooler bag to anyone who wants to keep food cool and not have to carry a heavy cooler around. Enjoy!"
5,Big bag in little britches!,"I was hesitant about buying an insulated bag over the Internet. I thought it was one of those things that I should really see and touch before making my decision. I didn't have time to go around to different stores so when I came across this one and read the reviews I decided to chance it. I am so extremely pleased. I used the bag to take a ""birthday"" meal to my father - transferred to plastic containers - 3 1/2 hours from me. It kept the food cold and even the frozen food frozen. The construction is very nice for the price. A nice heavy canvas exterior and heavy sheet plastic inside. Simple to put ""together""...just one part, but a little folding. I didn't get any instructions with mine. I saw on another review (for another bag) that you should refrigerate the bag before using and I think that may have been key to it working so well. A great bag at a nice low price!"
5,Great Travel Cooler,"Road trips are made easier with this cooler. Sealed up with goodies and a freezer bag, this thing keeps cold for around 7 hours inside the car. The opening on top is nice. Smaller than the larger full opening it allows you to remove things without letting all the cold out. Very pleased."
4,I use this everyday,"I use this cooler bag for everyday shopping & have found it to be extremely useful. I'm not sure how well it would hold up once the ice in the picture started to melt, but to keep things cold (or warm), it's great. Only minor drawback it the outer material looks bit 'dusty' all the time & is a hassle to clean, but the interior cleans up nicely. I highly recommend this item."
1,Pourrais faire mieu,"Lorsque l'ancien leader des Jericho et P76 et stoneageheart ce fait un album solo du type Songwriter. Malheuresement, bien que l'album soit assez agréable à écouter, il y a quand mme le cté Pop qui reste en influence principale de ce Monsieur.Bref soit il continue dans le cté songwriter, soit il reste dans un groupe POp, mais il ne peut pas faire les deux"
5,EASY,"Great product and fast service from the vendor. Easy to install, just put it in the bay and turn the computer on and let xp do the rest."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought 2 of these for 2 separate storage rooms, one without climate control and one with climate control. I ran a test of both in our home with several good thermostats in home. Neither Taylor 5422 worked, and both gave wildly different readings. Don't waste your money on these."
3,"Comfortable, but constant adjustment","These are the first knee pads I've owned for professional contract work. They are comfortable and certainly are a vast improvement over bare knees on hard floors! I used them to install a wood floor, and will note that one of my co-workers had a different brand that left marks all over the floor. To their credit, these pads did not. My one complaint is that they require nearly constant adjustment. The top straps slide in their friction buckles, so almost every time I stood up I had to lift the knee pads higher on my leg and cinch down the top adjustment strap. Very annoying! The bottom strap is held in place by velcro, which seems a much better way to go."
2,constant adjustment required,"I thought the gel insole would be nice...and it is, however with these on, the pads stick out too far and as a result they cannot be tightened enough to keep them in place.....i have truly tried to solve the problem cuz i like the gel deal,,but EVERYTIME i stand up, i have to pull the pads up. i even tightened them to the point of discomfort, but they still failed to stay..the bottom should be longer to allow for the bending"
3,They're okay.,"I wanted to like these knee pads, but I couldn't. When they worked, they were fantastic. However, they kept sliding down my legs. I'd have to re-adjust continually; its bulk didn't help. Eventually, I just stopped using them."
2,Creeping down your leg all day is worth 2 stars,"For my job i'm constantly on the move & working floor level. The reason i gave them 2 stars is the stitching coming out of the velcro pieces,one pad lost 3/4 of its stitching & the top strap is worthless do too the buckle lets the strap loosen up. And from all the adjusting you get a clump of pants an straps behind your knee, that feels good when you get down to work on something floor level. First and only day i wore them i worked 9hr shift then sent them back."
5,Great kneepads,"My dad's knees are going bad but he still likes to do a lot of work around the house. These kneepads have hard plastic on the outside, and soft gel on the inside. Very comfortable and a great price, especially compared to the same product in the home centers.Strongly recommended for anyone who does work around the house that requires you to kneel a lot, like in the basement. Even if your knees are still good, it helps prevent injury and soreness."
3,Good Product,"I got these as a Christmas gift for my husband. He said that they were great, however the straps start to rub the back of his legs after wearing them for a long period of time."
3,Not Built For Comfort,This product appears to be very well made. My objection is that they are not as comfortable as other knee pads I have used. I have a Custome Leathercraft tool belt and its the best I have ever seen. This product just doesnt compare in quality to other Custome Leathercraft products.
5,Excellent and heavy duty bar,I was looking for a stabilizer bar for my new tacoma. This bar is awesome. Extremely well made (USA not that china [..]). The only thing I would add is a lock of some sort so thieves can lift it out of the back of your truck. Highly recommended
2,pay for what you get. WILL RUST,this product was ok. the first thing i want to say is that it will rust. i think after about 2 weeks i already noticed it. but it was cheap so i guess i dont expect much. you have buy extra dividers because it does not come with it. i've used it for about 2 months but the rust was getting so bad i removed it. i guess if you just keep it dry and remove it after every use you wouldnt have this problem.. but who wants to do that? its got plenty of grip.. if only they would have coated it or made it out of a better/ longer lasting material. personally i dont recommend this.
5,Best you can buy!,"Compared to similar products sold at truck shops and Amazon, this product is the best built, strongest load lock on the market. But be careful; it may be so strong that it may bend the inside panels of your bed. I made it so tight that it almost cracked the camper shell on the truck.The bar has exceeded all my expectations. It has held up to some pretty heavy unstable cargo (110 Gallon Salvage Drums) without breaking a sweat! I would suggest buying the Heininger 4017 HitchMate Cargo StabiLoad Divider Bar to keep things from sliding side to side (I bought two of them)."
4,cargo bar,"it works great, it is heavy duty, functions properly,my only gripe is corrosion resistance-- after only 2-3 weeksin the bed of my truck the bar has started rusting, some of the picturesare misleading the large visible part of the bar, the outer tube is justmild steel painted with thin black paint, ill probably just keep touchingit up with a can of rustoleum. if the manufacturer reads this- pleaselook into powder coat or cadmium platingbut overall it does its job very well- it is just going to be ugly"
2,Awkward,"I was on the fence between a 2 star and 3 star. I gave this one a 2 star because its awkward to install it in my Silverado's bed. It's not a ratcheting system either, even though the photo looks like it. It's a guess at the width you will need install....if you guess wrong, it'll either be too loose, or way too tight. You definitely can't do this with just one hand. As far as my wife being able to install it, that's not going to happen. Its just too clumsy.However, its incredibly sturdy and I anticipate it to last a long time. I have a bed cover, so I won't see the rust issues that others have talked about. But I'm hoping this one lasts longer than the other crappy bars I have purchased in the past. (Not from same manufacturer) I'll deal with the clumsiness as long as I have the truck. I don't anticipate buying another one."
4,Delightful music,"The first CD is a wonderful collection of light hearted popular French titles, many of which most people know from various media, but they just don't know their associated song titles. e.g. ""The Poor People of Paris,"" ""Mademoiselle de Paris,"" ""Pigalle,"" etc. And a few they don't. Music to sooth the soul, this is. Makes me want to sip an espresso on a French sidewalk café while listening.The second CD, not so much. Some nice classics, but the rest are forgettable (unlike in the other series of ""A Taste Of . . .""). If it were not for that, I would give this CD 5 stars.My only other regret is that the producers did not expand on this collection of wonderful music to include countries such as Poland, Russia or perhaps Hungary. Plenty of material exists there. Oh well, C'est la vie."
2,Standard Deer Whistles,Good adhesive. Clip in back holds whistles in bracket but may be hard to get to depending upon where installed
1,Deer are unpredictable...,"The fact that one person (previous reviewer) had some deer stand and watch him proves nothing. (The fact that he saw them suggests it was daytime, anyway, when they would not be dazzled by headlights.) All credible independent tests show them to be ineffective. The companies that sell them claim otherwise, but if you look into it very deeply you will find that they can't back these claims up.Here are the facts: [...]Here is what happened when someone asked the Save-A-Deer company to back up its claims (he found they basically made them up with a joke of a study, claimed to be independent but actually done by the company's owner): [...]"
5,Great info in a small little book,"The best thing about Citypack books are the full sized maps that are included. These books come with plastic covering that makes them very easy to carry around with you as you travel the city. I love how they list the 20 top sights to see, so if you only have a few days, you can easily decide what to put at the top of the list. Beyond that, the advice they give is great (for instance, how Alcatraz tickets usually get sold out) and I love how they list all the clubs, bars, restaurants, and childrens' stuff, etc into categories. It also helps you find your way around public transportation, shopping, etc. and provides helpful phone numbers throughout. I highly reccommend this and it is well worth the price."
3,Not fresh product,The thinkOrganic Pecan Cashew bars did not taste fresh and the consistency was not pleasant.
1,Ravensburger Little Princess - 100 Piece Puzzle,I ordered a few items from you for my granddaughter for Christmas. They arrived in time so I could send them to her for Christmas. What I am not happy about is the way I got harrassed by phone about magazines that you were selling me and other things. Then on top of that because we bought from you SOMEONE took my credit card number and attacked that card. I will never buy from you again. I do not need this stress from the problems that this has caused. I used Amazon because you had good prices. Never suspecting that I would have all of these problems.My card account is now frozen and the bank is proceeding with action against the ones that did this to us.David Roeder
1,Don't waste your money,"I would rate this a ""0"", but it wasn't an option available. I never got a decent batch of ice cream out of this product. Just a soupy mush. Tried multiple different recipes and even ran 2 separate trials with this machine next to my original,very tired Oster machine. The worn out machine made a great batch, this one, zilch."
2,Not that happy with item.,"When I ordered this item, it never stated that it worked with a mixer. Well I do not have the mixer that goes with this ice cream maker. It did not come this all items that it stated it came with. I think it would work fine if you had the mixer that worked with it. I also think the item has been used before.Thank youMichael A. Velto"
1,This movie sucks,"Love zombie flicks, and like to watch low-budget zombie films. But this movie straight out SUCKS. Bad story-line that makes no sense, silly plot, bad actors, overall a waste of time. Don't rent and don't buy, unless you like throwing away money. Don't let the one star fool you, I had to give it that, in order to post my review."
4,hilarious,"i loved this movie...ok i admitt it is a cheaply funded b movie, but, it was like watching evil dead 1 and 2...hilarious.....the gross out gags with the zombies were fantastic!this disc set came with movies 1 and 2 , and i recommend all zombie fans adding this to their library."
4,Over the Top Argentinian Zombie Comedy,"I ordered these movies (there are 2 Movie DVDs in this, the original and the sequel) some years ago after seeing a preview that looked pretty good.. I didn't realize this was 2 movies at first.The first movie is kind of slow to start with but finishes pretty well even with very low budget effects. I'd give it a 3 star review. The second film one is my Top 10 Zombie pics of all time and I'm giving my review a 4 because of it. It truly shows what can be done even with a low budget.*If your looking for a ""serious"" zombie flick, your not going to enjoy this as it is a comedy. The humor here is similar to Dead Alive or Evil Dead.*Anyone who thinks this is the worst zombie film ever, has not watched many zombie films and probably wouldn't enjoy 99% of them anyway.*It's in Spanish with English subtitles. I've loaned this movie out a few times, and most everyone who's seen it.. liked it!It's my understanding that these are the first zombie flicks from Argentina."
1,GARBAGE,"This must be the worst film of all time.i bought this because of some of the 5 star reviews people gave it.how can anyone think this is good? acting,plot,effects all terrible.AVOID!!!! 0 OUT 0F 5"
1,garbage,"don't buy this garbage... 30 minutes into this, it was the worst movie i ever saw in my life. and i've seen alot of movies. in no way is it funny or action packed or anything... don't waste your money or your time."
2,Not worth it,"I havent noticed it ""detect"" an odor. It just randomly sprays. And its far from quiet. I used to have it in the master bedroom bathroom but I had to move it because every time it went off it sounded like someone was sneezing.The design is nice.....but its not worth the money"
3,"product is fine, the price isn't",I got too excited when I saw this product in the lightning deal. Got it for $8.99. Then saw it on sale at the grocery store for $7.99 (reg 11.00 or 14.99 I can't remember)
2,"Expensive Refills, Second Lasting Scent","With coupons, these go down up to $3. The refills however, are expensive, more then actual plastic container itself. And the scent, is not long lasting AT ALL. It sprays and it refreshes a small square area of the direction it's pointed at. And then just like that, the scent is completely gone."
3,BE AWARE... (read),"I bought this actually from Walmart, on sale for $6.00. It was a good deal. It was simple to set up and works fine BUT... if you have or are used to a quiet home, be aware that this automatic air freshener will scare the crap out of you. You forget that its there or on and when it sprays or you hear it, it makes you jump. It's not extremely loud but loud enough to where it will frighten you. As for the scent, its fairly strong. I have mine set for every 36 minutes and the motion detector is off. The motion detector works really well; almost too well. Not recommended if you have a sensitive nose or allergies."
1,"Nice product, high price","I've bought this product on Amazon. It is a good product. But the price is too high here. I have seen the same product with only $8.99 in food lion and no more than $10.00 in target. So...if you want to buy this, shop in store not online."
2,Overpriced!,"$8.99 as the Gold Box price??? that's the usual price in CVS or Walgreens, and with coupons you can get it for under $5."
2,disappointment,I have not had good luck with any of the Airwick products...I started out with the plug-ins and loved them until I had bought a bunch of refills and soon the plugs quit working...I bought new plugs and they worked about a week and burned out or just quit. I then tried the Imotion machine and loved it. I used it for 3 months and it worked fine so I bought another one plus 4 refills. You guessed it...now I have about $35.oo worth of machines and refills and the machines do not work. I am now going to give up on airwick products altogether. I am disappointed because I have been using airwick products since the 60's starting with the bottles with a pull up wick.
1,okay scent/ annoying machines,"Not only are these things LOUD when they go off but they are defective. I have it on the sensor setting so it should only go off if someone walks by it but it's going off at all hours of the night. I downgraded from a larger model with no sensor to this so that hopefully it wouldn't be as disturbing but I was wrong. The lavender doesn't really smell like lavender, it's more of a chemical, clean, artificial perfume scent. The plug ins don't seem to last long enough but I don't think these are worth the disruption of peace..."
2,Concho,"I was disappointed with this item. It worked fine for the first day or two and now, you can't tell it is there. I wanted something that would fill the room with a pleasant odor."
4,Works pretty well,"The scents that are available for the sprayer are not my favorite. However, the sprayer works as designed. You can pick to have it spray in increments. I have mine in my exercise room and it sprays every 36 minutes (the maximum interval). I would like if it had a longer interval, as the longest interval is more than often enough in a small room. I have guests over and they can hear it spraying in the other room. One young lady thought it was me, umm,, ""relaxing""."
2,CAREFUL ON VYNIL FLOORS,I purchased this product for use in the guest powder room. When it sprays the spray goes so far that it lands on the Vynil floor.It sprays a little over a foot even on the lowest setting. This makes for a very slippery situation on Vynil. In a carpeted room it may work better but be very careful on a smooth floor.
2,The Amazon price is NUTS!!!!,"This item is way way overpriced here on Amazon. I think it's 8 bucks or so in local drugstoresAnd it is not all that great a product anyway.Basically it's a bit of plastic that you put this overpriced aerosol can in. That covering has some sort of button that pushes on an aerosol can and sprays when and where you least want it. (although it is easy to control the direction of the spray, it sprays enough to make the area it sprayed all wet)I had two of them, and had gotten them for free, because I had clipped coupons and bought them at Walgreens.I was happy to throw them into the recycling container when they were gone, and swore I would never buy a refill for one."
1,smells yuck!,The smell of the lavender is AWFUL!! It seriously smells like an old person home mixed with stinky hairspray. I love lavender and this was a sad disappointment.
1,Okay,Well this thing sprays all the time for no reason at times and when you want it to spray nothing. A great idea but not the best. Expensive to refill so I will go back to the plug ins for now or just plan old spray.
4,Outstanding,"The first half of this album is pretty much flawless. Actually, more than that, I'd say through Paper Crowns. After that, it kind of gets old, until Dear Hilary. Still, this a great CD and definitely worth the purchase price. The best tracks are Outside the Aviary, A Lexicon, A Song With No Words, Paper Crowns, and the Surgeon's House. Dear Hilary is also good, and the idea behind it is, I think, a good one. It's my favorite of the Scott Richter songs, although I haven't heard all of them. The best part of the album, not surprisingly, is the bass, but the rest of it is good too. Also, I'm sure if you're here you don't need to hear this, but Jawbox is worth it to check out as well."
5,Wow!,"This mouse is so cool! I have been using my NB-75 for several years now, and just the thought of having to use any other mouse gives me the heebie-jeebies. Essentially, you get the best of every mouse. It is not a bulky brick like other wireless mice, nor does it have a cable that would require tape and velcro to achieve the same weightless feel. Do not be confused, because the mouse has a very satisfying grip, and will not slide on accident. The auxiliary buttons are above the exact place that your thumb rests, so they are so easy and convenient to press. The side-scroll had me in a stupefaction because I did not care about that feature, nor did I plan to use it. Then I used it, and it is so much better than other devices, simply move your finger left and right as though you were waggling your finger at someone, and it works.Buy this mouse!!! You have no idea what you are missing! If this mouse goes extinct, then it will be yet another item for the endless list of consumer failure."
5,Amazing!,This book is simply amazing. I got a 4 on the AP Euro exam because of this book alone. Worth every penny.
4,Concise and to the point,"""Modern European History"" is definetely a must-have supplement for any student currently enrolled a European History course. However, if you are taking the AP course, have maintained a good average and taken notes all year, then this book does very little to prepare you for the AP exam (the book doesn't even mention AP). It is a handy reference, though, that can be used as a quick review of the material."
3,"A great class guide, but a poor AP Test Review book...","This book is great for studying for tests. It is solid in all subjects except the Enlightment, Scientific Revolution, and Cold War. This is because it does not give you the big picture very well. Then again no book does that (in my point of view.)The real weak side of the book is that it is to detailed to be a AP Euro Exam review book. It just has way to facts, I would recommend the Princton Review book for that. So I gave it a 3 for good class review, and bad AP Exam review."
4,Some what helpful,"this book was quite helpful, but it wasn't very interesting because there weren't pictures to give an illustrated summary of history. Overall this book was written well and because I was forced to read it I was glad I did. GO WHITNEY and BUY THIS BOOK because it is worth the 7 dollars, don't buy it at barnes an noble or borders because they simply don't have the book."
5,Fantastic!,"One word puts this book in summation: ""Wow!"" This book is simply terrific. It summarizes European History from the 1450s - 1990 in a way that makes you remember every single piece of information. In addition to helping me study for the AP Exam, I used this book for...1) Research Papers2) Class Exams3) Research Projects4) Curiosity (I found myself flipping through this book looking for something new)In addition to this, it really highlights your class textbook well. I brought it to class one day, and within a week, three people told me they bought it and found it just as great. I have to say that this book helped me achieve a 5 on my AP European History exam.Do yourself a huge favor and buy this book!"
5,AP European History Students: Please Read!,I just got my AP exam scores today for the 2005 examinations and I am proud to say that I got a 4 on the exam thanks to this book and the Princeton's Review Book. This book has a really good and easy to understand review for each of the topics tested on the AP exam and it really helps alot!
1,What a rip off!,Everything that is in this book can be found for free at your local Small Business Administration. If I were alone in a cabin in the middle of the Alaskan winter I would burn this book instead of wasting good firewood. Unfortunately I am in Puerto Rico so all I can do is stare at my wasted fifteen dollars on my bookshelf over a rum and coke.
4,A Delighful Little Book,"My family used this book as an addition to our devotions and found it to be very nice, even my four year old enjoyed it while he laughed through the entire book. The stories are delightful, all are humorous and some have heartwarming touches. You'll laugh one minute and fight off tears the next. Phil has an easy writing style and can tell a nice story. He seems like a great guy, the kind of guy you'd like to be friends with. If you like short stories about marriage, kids and family then you'll enjoy this book.1 Star = Pathetic2 Stars = Fair3 Stars = Good4 Stars = Excellent5 Stars = Life changing"
4,Nice shoe!,"I bought a pair of these shoes in black couple months ago and have worn them so much already! They are classy and feminine looking yet comfortable. My only complaint is that the material appears to be starting to wear (very slightly) under my big toe. I only notice this when I look closely, though. Otherwise, they're still in great condition. It may be my fault for wearing them & walking around in them so much! If they had the same color in my size still available, I would buy another pair in an instant."
1,Not upto expectations,"The shoes looked really nice in the photos,but I was very disappointed to see the real thing. They looked old and worn out and totally not worth the price."
5,A must-see for Bonanza fans - especially Adam fans,"For those who hold Adam Cartwright as their favorite Cartwright, this tape is sure to please: he is prominently featured in both episodes; the first also has nice focus for Ben and the second for Hoss. I liked both stories a lot - the first had an exciting Indian fight/Cavalry sequence that does NOT have a happy ending, but is a sobering reminder of how much damage even one person's pettiness and dishonor can do. The second is about mining safety, and the difficulty in balancing human life over profit. I thought both still seemed to have timely and intelligent messages, and were exciting and well written."
2,"Not a ""how-to""","Although the back cover purports that this book will ""teach you the basics of drawing the figure in action and beyond!"", it does nothing of the kind. There is no instruction. There are no steps. What you get is a collection of very good examples. Thus its essentially useless to the beginner. Its also very slim and awkardly over-sized."
2,part thre and one are identical,"Of this symphonie, part 3 and one are identical. Above that there is some coughing in this music. The pace I think is not right. Compare this bargain to other recordings and you will notice that it is not bad. Some explanation about Cesare Cantieri and Suddeutsche Philharmonie would not be out of place. It is good to begin with, but i for myself have abandonned this recording for other interpretations by Daniel Barenboim and/or Vladimir Delman. One can obrtain these recordings from second sound shops. For the long term, that would be better. Elegant music= Yes. More than that no Two stars only Music quality is allright in general."
5,Exploration of America's Northwest,"I highly recommend this well written book(650+ pgs.)to anyone that wants to know how it was and what was witnessed (in great detail) by the explorers who walked/road across america's west before it was developed.I recommend you first read Undaunted Courage(Lewis and Clark Expedition) by Stephen Ambrose, Astoria and The Adventures of Captain Bonneville by Washington Irving."
4,fascinating book,"This book details the expeditions of the arrogant and somewhat misguided John C Fremont as remembered by him 40 years after his expeditions and as embellished by his wife. It's fascinating, and there are other books on the subject with more truth and less bias."
1,A MUST READ!!!!,"This Book is a must read for Everyone, however it was very useful to me pesonally, because I work in a prison and it helped me in my day to day dealings with criminals. These folks can be the biggest Con Artist, they have a lot of time on their hands!!I feel like I'm One step ahead of them at all times, after reading Mr. Marlocks Book. GOOD JOB Mr. Marlock. Will you be giving us any more Books?"
2,The con is on the reader for buying this book,"This book is a lightweight book on scams and cons. Of its 10 chaptures, only 2 of them cover cons in detail. And, of those cons, they're all of the old and well known, and well publisized, variety, with little original material. The rest of the 8 chaptures are fluff, and the entire book can be read in about two hours.I was expecting form this book that, well, at least it would live up to its title. I wanted a book to describe how cons are created and executed. Anyone hoping to earn a second wage as a con by reading this book better not give up his day job!"
3,How About The Trend To Legalization Of Cons?,"Now you see it, now you don't. The traditional forms of the well-known con games--the old hat tricks--are well covered in this book. But, the book is remiss in covering the trend toward legalization of cons. (Yes, a ""sanitization"" process is in full sway, which threatens all of us. This is not touched upon.)This book, however, is excellent at delving into the psyche of the con man. It examines, and exposes, the thinking processes to a remarkable degree of accuracy.In all, there are some valuable points to be learned and absorbed about this ""profession"" from this book."
2,Might be worth 99c,His Scam School show has some bad tricks but some great ones too. In the book there's a few okay ones but most are pretty stupid. Your friends would get bored with them pretty quickly.
4,Good read,"This is a very good read. Interesting, fast paced, novel will keep your interest and have you asking for more."
4,Few details on Con's and consistent warnings that you will be caught,"I liked the book, although I was looking for a much more in depth treatment of the subject. The author consistently stresses that if you choose to be a con artist you will be caught and exhibits some frustration that con artists are not punished more severly than they are, since most con artist crimes are perceived as crimes the victims brought on themselves through their own greed and avarice.The title is somewhat misleading. Don't read this is you want to actually be a con artist as you won't learn too many tricks. There is a detailed explanation on how to short change someone, which I found interesting, but most other con artist tricks are given vague explanations.If you want to know about con artists read this as part of a more extensive study as it does not stand on its own as a resource."
5,a transformer for anyone,"This Transformer was my introduction to Transformers. Grimlock was my very first Transformer. It gets lost eisier with siblings, but most people will like it alot. If you're a fan of Transformers or you're being introduced to them Grimlock is great!"
1,Beware predatory shipping costs,"Just a note about this specific product as sold by the vendor. The cost is less than a dollar, but they are charing almost $7 in ""shipping and handling"" costs for each card. So if you want 10 of these cards, you're really paying $8 a card... not a terrible price, but certainly not the $.95 as advertised. If the shipping and handling was $7 for an order, or even offered at a sliding scale for multiple items, it would be more reasonable, but this is close to deceptive advertzing, IMO."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,For some reason this is my dogs FAVORITE toy and his is so old and dirty. The stores don't carry this product in this size anymore so I was glad to find it online.
3,"some good photos, some good tips but not a build it guide","I expected this book to have pictures but I'd hoped for more information on how to build a straw bale structure. The Steen's first book, The Straw Bale House, did much more for the person needing information. This book is good for someone just starting to get into the subject but if you actually want to build a home and don't know much about construction or carpentry you'll have to go elsewhere for that information."
5,Get a copy!,"If you want to convert your friends to strawbale... if you are sick of the Three Little Pigs comments... get this book. I did and one of my friends stole it so now I've had to buy it again - that's how good it is! Nearly everyone I show this book to is entranced by one or more of the houses... and many people love LOTS of the buildings. I love this book. It's portable, which is an asset, but mainly it's inspiring... thanks Athena!"
4,Nice Photos,"This book is almost a coffee table book. The photos are beautiful and include everything from small,simplistic homes in Mexico to high-end beauties in California. You won't find much info here but you can get some good ideas for your own home. If you want specific info on building (especially in colder, wetter climates) get ""Serious Straw Bale-A Home Construction Guide for All Climates"" by Paul Lacinski and Michel Bergeron."
2,Nice pictures,"If you're looking for a ""construction"" type book, this is a little lacking in that department. I was much more impressed with other books that the Steens have done."
4,not for women only,"IMHO, this book bests Stretching, 20th edition, by Anderson. for the info it provides regarding the circumstances of stretching, info which doesn't appear in Stretching. Also, unlike Anderson's book, the authors aren't trying to sell you equipment. The bibliography and index indicate that this book is a professional work. GUYS, do not be put off by the fact that all of the drawings are of a woman. It is worth the price."
3,Excellent guide!,"As a novice to Acess data base, this book was very helpful and very practical to work my way around the systems as a new learner."
5,Access 2007 for Dummies,"Anytime I want to learn something new about a computer or a program, I turn to the Dummies books. I own a number of these books. Everyong is an excellent read and will tell you anything you wish to know on the subject of the book. Plus it's put into words anyone can understand."
5,Phew!,"Much needed. I took a course (with no handouts). This book not only refreshed the memory and is a great reference, but also gave me some new tips."
5,Access 2007 for Dummies,"Access 2007 for Dummies is written very well The printing of thefigures such as 2-21,3-1 etc could be clearer.Personally I am unable to read the writings properlyin most of them.Beside that comment I am very pleased with the bookDealings with Amazon is superbAccess 2007 For Dummies"
4,Perfect for the Upgrade,My Office upgraded everyone to this version so I had to kinda try to figure out how things had changed until I got this book.Very helpful and a lot less stress.
2,Authors have lost touch,"I was incredibly disappointed with this book. For instance by page 12, no screen prints or pictures have been provided to support the convoluted language meant for those already familiar.This was a waste of time for me as a beginner. How can you progress if the ""techie"" language is not further broken down and, demonstrated.Now who is the dummy?"
2,Hard to see Screen Pictures,"The writting and verbage of the book is OK but it is near to impossible to read the 'screen shots' of the book. I've seen the earlier ""ACCESS 2003 for DUMMIES"" and the screen shots are bigger and crystal clear and easy to see and read."
2,alt-country weirdness,"i read a good reveiw of this and picked it up,expecting a killer surf album. there are three really good surf instrumentals and the rest of the album is... country. if you're into that alt-country thing, you may like this, but don't expect anything more."
3,Decent best of classic rock,"'Joey Vendetta Presents 100% Pure Rock' has a title that is just a tad bit misleading. While there are several songs here that rightfully belong here, there are others that should not be here.Joey didn't do a bad job picking out songs. Steppenwolf's 'Born To Be Wild,' a cool live version of Heart's 'Barracuda' and the Southern rock anthem, Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Sweet Home Alabama' all appear on this compilation.But there are plenty songs that should be omitted. Donnie Iris, Don McClean, Dr. Hook and Kim Mitchell I don't think belong on here. They should have been replaced with some Led Zeppelin, The Who or perhaps The Rolling Stones.Overall, if you want a quick, thorough look at some cool classic rock tracks from groups like The Hollies and Skynyrd, than you ought to try this one. It is a nice sampler, but it is pretty rare. It's relatively expensive too.Recommended, but only for casual classic rock fans."
5,Not only for the snobs,A depth analysis of the Israeli wine industry + reviews of more than 1500 wines. Written by a real pro who thinks not only about what the snobs will like but what the average drinker will enjoy. A great guide for buying.
2,FAR FROM REALISTIC!!,"I have played Hoyle Poker games for many 100s of hours. Its programming is NOT realistic. Until SIERRA's programming sort out the randomness do not spend any money on it. You are just funding sloppy, poor programming. There are too many good hands in Poker - this just does not happen. When you believe you have a winnable hand more often than expected someone has something better. Also, with so many good hands you cannot bluff readily. This is not credible. Its AI is non-existent. It is not realistic!"
1,Games not realistic!!,"I played the tournament Texas Hold Em poker and there is no way you can get pass the second round. You can have 3 of kind, and the other player would have 4 of a kind. You can have a flush, 2 other players would have a straight flush. This is what it is like almost every hand. Anyone who plays poker knows you don't see that many good hands out there.Blackjack is way to unrealistic. If you have a 20 and the dealer has a 5 face up, he seems to always to get a 6, then a 10 to get 21. I played 10 straight hands, the dealer had 4 blackjacks and 6 20's. That is almost impossible for a dealer to get that lucky. And if you see the dealer has a king faced up, just surrender unless you have 21 because the dealer ALWAYS has another king down.If you want to learn how to play the game, you should get this, but if you already know how to play, don't buy this, it is a waste of money!"
1,Hoyle Casino 2003,"Hi to whom may concern,I have been very frustrating and I have been asking same question to every software store as they couldn't answer if this will work for MAC OS X system because I have the old verison that says go back to system 9. Will this 2003 works for X system? Please advise...Russ"
4,Lot's of fun and good practice,The table games are great and the play is very realistic. The players voices are a turn-off after a while so I play with the sound off. It is a great way to sharpen your skills before a trip to Vegas or AC. I had never played Pai Gow Poker but I learned from this software and look forward to trying it in a casino. The craps and roulette are fun too. I don't play slots in a casino so I don't use the slots on this either.Overall I think this is a good buy for some fun on the PC.
1,not for people who can play,"I have a copy of the '98 version of this program. Even though you have to adjust to needing better hands to win than you would in a real game, I can still beat the game a majority of the time after I adjust to it's peculiarities. This one (the 2003 version), however, isn't simply tougher to win against, it appears to be programmed to be impossible. I've played it for hours using all kinds of strategies, sound ones and crazy ones, just to see if I could get ahead. Usually when I would get a great hand and would most likely win, the other player or players would most of the time have better hands. This goes against random probabilities and makes it a joke to even try playing. I found this feature on all the card games. I was looking forward to playing this updated version but am very disappointed. Also, when paying back a loan, which supposedly the game requires, it won't let you. It will only let you take out a loan."
3,Hoyle Casino 2003,It's ok but if you have an older version don't waste your money there isn't much difference.
1,Don't waste your money,"Hoyle is by far the worse casino game that I have purchased. It has too many bugs. Every time I try to play my computer reboots by itself and you lose all the information stored. The older version of hoyle did the same thing. I thought the newer version would be an improvement, but its not. If you like to play casino games, stick to Avery Cardoza."
1,Useless,I bought this punch to use for my Franklin-Covey (7 holes) and Cambridge (5 holes) binders. It didn't work for either one of them. The heads cannot slide all the way across the body. This limits the patters which can be punched.
2,Good quality but not FULLY Adjustable,Great quality punch - but advertised as FULLY adjustable. The 7 punch heads are adjustable within 3 areas. If your punch needs are in between those areas you're out of luck. Should be listed as semi-adjustable.Won't work for me.
1,Swingline Adjustable 7 Hole Desktop Punch with Seven Punch Heads (A7074027K),"I purchased this product because I needed a seven hole punch, and the description claims ""With its seven punch head capacity, the hole punch is completely adjustable for diverse punching needs..."". However, you can NOT place the 7 hole punches at any setting you want because there are ""parking spots"" where you can place the punch if you don't want to use it so when you press down on the handle that punch in the ""parking spot"" does not push down. So you can NOT set this up to punch in any place that you want. Some of those ""parking spots"" are exactly where I needed it to punch."
1,Holepunch missing middle punch,"This hole punch was a grave dissapointment. First, don't expect to punch more than 4 sheets of paper at a time. Secondly, there is no way to make a hole in the center punch. I don't know another reason to need a 7-hole punch except to add pages to a daytimer . . . I still have to punch one hole manually because there is a gap in the middle where you cannot add a hole punch."
3,"Functional, but not fantastic","There aren't many options for the person who needs to punch 7 holes in this configuration, so I'm just glad to have something that serves the purpose. BUT: I had get a large screwdriver and widen the openings on all but one of the punch heads. I couldn't even slip ONE piece of paper in there, let alone the ""eleven"" that they claim. By the way, don't try to punch 11 sheets with this thing, it definitely is not capable of that...more like 2-3. It's okay, not great. Priced a little high for the quality."
2,Not easy to operate,"7 punches make this hand puncher difficult to operate with more than 2 pages. Sometimes gets stuck and makes difficult to get paper out. Unfortunately, if you need 7 punched holes for use with the Day Timer portfolio, choices are limited.I would not recommend this product to a friend."
5,7 HOLE PUNCH,"This product performs as advertised, however it was not good for my purpose which was to punch 7 holes the same as business check page holes. I was able to modify it to work but not as good as if it was manufactured for that purpose. If used as intended it is a great product."
2,WWII Combat Elite Paratroopers,"WWII Combat Elite Paratroopers is a far from decent game. The graphics are incredible primitive, the gameplay stinks, and a horrific, mandatory third-person view throughout the game. The gameplay is boring, the dialogue is corny, and I can't see who I'm shooting with this stupid view. As far as WWII games go you'd be much happier with a Call of Duty or Medal of Honor game."
1,It's Just Not that Great,"This game would be a heck of a lot better if they fixed your view to like Brothers in Arms or Call of Duty. This game, you're physically controlling a guy and your view is fixed to a certain place in front of you so you can't see the people shooting at you half the time. There's a sewer scenario and you literally will beat your head against the wall because you're firing at God knows what because you can't see it. Not sure who thought that would be a good angle for a view but they should be fired and beaten, or beaten then fired.Graphics are poor, guns ok. There's a feature to ""turn up the blood"" yet because of the poor graphics and view you never see any blood. Horrible, horrible game. Save your cash for the better Call of Duty, Brothers in Arms or any other WWII game."
1,Eating with a conformed to the world view,"If you want to read a great book on this subject; read ""What The Bible Says About Healthy Living"" by Rex Russell M.D."
2,Looks are deceiving,"Wish I'd read reviews before, not after purchasing the drying rack, as I have had the same problems as a several others mentioned. My utensils (spoons and forks) are elongated and narrow at the handle end and fall through sides easily and crossover to other compartments and become stuck. I don't feel comfortable putting steak and paring knives blade end down in the rack for fear of cutting the coating.The rack is very heavy duty and appears well made. When it hangs off of my dish rack, it sits at a slant. I would prefer it sit straight up and down. After about a month of use, I replaced it with my old drying rack and moved the newer rack to my laundry room sink. Works much better there holding miscellaneous items such as small scrub brushes, sponges, sink strainers, etc which don't fall through the side slats."
2,Work out Ok but not perfect.,First it look like 100% perfect. But after I load all the silverware in. Some of the small item got jam or fell out the four corner.I did not return the item but order two other style of cutlery holder (clear). Amazon sale this item. Please search B0000Y7ZV8.
5,Love this product,I hate dish racks that sit on the counter taking up space. If you have a double sink...this works great.
3,utensil drying rack,"Well its certainly bigger then the one that came w/ the drier i bought. However, just be aware that the metal on the bottom is too far apart and silverware has a tendency to fall thru. Not a huge problem, but an annoyance."
1,Untensil drying rack,I should have listened to other reviews. The silverware falls through the holes on the bottom and sides. It is very annoying!
5,Great replacement for my dish drainer's flatware cup,"I have a stainless steel dish drainer, but the utensil cup was plastic and it fell apart. So I bought this utensil rack as a replacement. It's really nice! Heavy plastic-coated wire, it will never wear out, and the wire loops hold it right in place on the drainer. Well worth every penny."
3,"Kind of pricey, but it works",I purchased this to augment the rack space in my dishwasher. It doesn't have the outside mesh design between the compartments (just 3 strips of coated wire) and so it must be loaded carefully. But it does do what I wanted and was the only one I found like it after much searching.
1,Drainboard,It was too small and didn't fit our needs. We bought a new set at Costco. I was very disappointed. We ended up throwing it away.
2,Silverware Holder,"I thought it worked great at first, but have disoververed the silverware often slips through the holes, especially in the corners."
4,Sturdy,Does the job and made well. Fits on drain rack on either the inside or outside. Should hold up well.
5,Who could imagine that such a utililitarian object could be a life saver?,"Have been using a bamboo one that looks good, but my silverware kept sliding through the bottom slats. It was driving me mad, I'm telling you, mad. This is just the ticket and the vendor, Tellus Mater, were beyond expedient and left a sweet note on the invoice. I will definitely check out their store."
1,Don't buy this item.,"I have bought this i thought will fit on my kenmore unit. But when it came the item too small to fit on my unit. It suppose my kenmore unit is include according on the description. I have contacted the seller but never response. Stay away with this seller and its not worth to save a couple bucks, better go to sears to get your filter for less headache."
4,Pleasant CD,"An interesting project featuring Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys, Robert Lamm of Chicago and Gerry Beckley of America. It was Wilson's final project before his death from Cancer in 1998. The songs are solid, of not exceptionally memorable, and the singing is wonderful. Wilson, especially, who sings lead on nearly half of the album, soars vocally. Perhaps most affecting is the title cut, a song written by Carl about his troubled older brother Brian. It features Beach-Boys like harmonies and instrumentation and a magnificent, pained vocal from Carl. This album isn't perfect, but as a momento of one of the most underappreciated voices of Rock and Roll, it fits the bill."
5,This is the greatest!,I had looked forward to the Wilson-Lamm-Beckley CD for months and I am not disappointed. Carl Wilson's sweet vocals remind me of the loss the world suffered when Carl died. Highly recommended!
4,Music of the Heart and Soul,"If you like the rich vocal tapestries of the Beach Boys and that beautiful voice of Carl Wilson, three songs on the piece are enough to satisfy you. Hearing Carl's voice again was like a gift from God, but the contributions of both Lamm and Beckley were also heartfelt, tuneful compositions that were well sung and nicely mastered. Although I felt they leaned a little to much on synthesizers for my own taste, it was the vocal harmonies that made many of the songs stick in my head, and I would find myself humming them weeks later."
2,Unfortunately bland,"I really WANTED to like this album. It's just not good. Carl Wilson's voice is the only thing that got this album up to the two star level. The songs themselves are strictly one star fare. Unfortunate, as there is an enormous amount of talent in the group. Its biggest sin is not in being terrible, but in being bland and wholly unspectacular at every turn."
3,NOT THAT GREAT,"AMERICA, CHICAGO & BEACH BOYS FAN FOR SOMETIME. I THOUGHT AFTERREADING SOME OF THESE REVIEWS, I WOULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTED - BUTI WAS. CARL NEVER WAS A GOOD LEAD VOCALIST, ROBERT LAMM LOST ITA FEW ALBUMS AGO. ONLY GERRY BECKLEY MADE THIS CD WORTH BUYING.SORRY, BUT NOT THAT GREAT......"
3,A couple of surprises here...,"The opening track ""Today"" (although it has a synth part on it at the beginning that makes me cringe) is by far my favorite song on here. It has a great chorus and Carl Wilson sings it wonderfully. Robert Lamm sounded great on two of his tracks ""Feel The Spirit"" and ""Life In Motion"", singing with some gusto. (I skipped his last solo CD after reading a couple of not so good reviews..) Gerry Buckley's contributions are fine here too, but it's Carl Wilson that the focus is on. My only complaint would be that some of the production is, at times, a little too ""synthy""."
4,Good and solid,"I just recently got this CD in and the first time I listened to it I was happy with it. With me it takes more than one though. The second time around I was incredibly happy. The first song is a good starter. The second song ""Feel the Spirit"" is one of the most passionate songs Robert Lamm has ever written. The third is beautifully sung by Carl Wilson. Basically the whole CD is very well done although it's not without it's weak moments. The best songs are the ones that seem the most personal. All three men have an awesome blend together. This isn't something I would call ""incredible"" but it's still a good solid CD which is more than I can say for a lot of them. Robert Lamm has 2 leads, Gerry Beckley has 3 and Carl Wilson has 5. However all three men can be heard throughout the album."
4,Feel the Spirit,"Unlike most of the reviewers who seem to be Beach Boy/Carl Wilson fans, I purchased this CD because I am a forever Chicago/Robert Lamm fan. Motivation notwithstanding, this is a wonderful CD. All three voices come together as if they have always recorded together. Each song clearly shows the mark and style of its author. The Wilson tunes are beautiful and very Beach Boy-esque. But it is the works of Lamm and Beckley that keep me playing this CD. ""Today"", thought not penned by any of the three, is a catchy and fun first cut, and Beckley's ""Sheltering Sky"" is a great tune. The best song on the CD for me is Lamm's ""Feel the Spirit"". It exudes passsion and will move long time Chicago fans to tears. Contrary to one reviewers opinion, Robert Lamm's voice is far from mediocre, it soars."
3,This thing is BIG,"Got this tool belt and WOW, it is bigger than it looks in the ad, when I purchased it there were no exact size specs, I think they are there now. A lot of room, which is nice, but the only draw back is what attracted me to this in the first place... the little storage compartment at the bottom. It is a good concept, but being that the little plastic container sits flat the contents shake, and shift, and rattle. I have gotten in the habit of grasping the hammer loop as I walk to quiet it down, and a lot of people have jokes saying, ""I can hear you coming a mile away"". So pretty good bag, but very large, and if you use the storage.. NOISY."
3,Fluke Meter doesn't fit,"It's probably a good pouch for residential electrician, but for industrial work most important tool doesn't fit. My fluke 787 is slightly to big for front pockets, unless i jam it in. Which means a fluke 87 and 789 won't fit well either. Probably should have bought the 20 pocket pouch, b/c tools are really tight too."
3,"Expected Better, but it's pretty good...","Being a big fan of Manny in the clubs, I was looking forward to this CD. It's good, but it kind of focuses too much on Black Diva Vocal songs, and isn't quite as varied as a night at the Factory with Manny. I guess part of the problem is that the compilations are limited in the music they can license, so you can't get a CD with as many of the songs you hear out in the clubs. I really miss the days of bootleg CD's! Still, this one definitely has a few songs worth listening to."
3,maybe a bit advanced for the intended audience,"Don't get me wrong, I liked this book well enough. I'm just not sure this would be very good for the intended audience. The book itself is great. Packed with mystery and action and family secrets this would be a good read for an older teen. My problem with it is, that it starts out really clear but then quickly gets confusing and I see the younger end of the YA audience having a difficult time trying to sort it out. Otherwise, for an older child this would be wonderful."
2,shadows,"I really didn't like this book very well. I thought it was boring and also a little confusing. It is the first book in a 3 part series, but there is no way that I would want to read the other two books. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for reading when I had to read the book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Not at all what we expected..,This paper is low quality. Pictures do not print well on it. Huge disappointment. Price is low but there's good reason for that.
3,I found this paper to be rather thin,"I found this paper to be rather thin.I had purchased this to replace a package of photo paper from OfficeMax. I always prefer name brand products over store brands (I like made in USA too). However in this case I think the OfficeMax paper was better.I would still like to use Kodak paper, but something thicker. If someone knows a Kodak alternative, chime in."
4,Nice Paper,I gave this as a gift. From what I understand it is working well. There hasn't been any problems with it.
1,"DON'T BUY IT, It's junk","Like some of the other reviews, I loved cool edit pro. Then Adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2.0. I use this program often and tried to give it a chance. No way around it, it sucks now. I am going to use Sonar, a much better product. The only thing I like about 2.0 is that you can burn to a disc from Audition. That is the only reason why I gave it one star. This is not a user friendly program."
1,WINDOWS XP ONLY,I wanted to make sure people who look at this product have a full understanding that Adobe Audition 2.0 WILL NOT install on a Windows 2000 Pro or Server operating system. Almost EVERY reference I have seen regarding OS requirements say Windows but not specifically Windows XP. The only exceptions have been on the Audition box itself and this Amazon listing (go Amazon). So if you are a Windows 2000 user understand that you will need XP for this product. If you can find a copy of Audition 1.5 you're good to go.I would say more about the product if I could actually get it installed but with the 12 PCs I use not a one has XP so I have a $300+ book end until I can upgrade (if you can call it that) to XP.
1,"Overpriced, buggy piece of crap. Audition 1.5 was better.","If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you. Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle. Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit. But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.)Bottom line? This software is crap. Absolute crap. If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab. Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this.If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5.2.0 is about as useful as a football bat."
1,Stick with 1.5,"I suppose you could blame this on my system/drivers, but when Audition 1.5 fires up and works every time, and Audition 2.0 will freeze my machine after closing it, I guess I tend to go with 1.5.So it may work fine for you. I have several audio interfaces, and a TON of VST's, which are probably part of Audition's problem.The audio hardware configuration is confusing in Audition 2.0 and seems a little flaky, for instance, 2.0 won't recognize my Samson CO1U USB mic although 1.5 did. The hardware configuration UI in 1.5 is more like the hardware config UI in Sonar and Reason and Live."
3,Good Program But Over Priced,"Like the title says, Was a good program when it was Cool Edit Pro and NOW? well still just a good program and Alot over priced. I would think it would be better priced around $99 to $139 range. Been using Cool edit for years and needed this for my laptop.Pro Rodeo Announcer"
4,New Looking interface,I have been a end user of v1.0 since it's creation. Ver 2.0 offers new features that are an improvement to some extent. Major drawback is you can only register versions 2.0 & 3.0 to ONE user/computer at a time. I use a laptop at the gigs to record the project and would transfer info & tracks to my home computer for completion. NOT anymore using v2.0 & v3.0. Using 2 different versions is a pain as they are DOWNWARD compatible ONLY. A call to Adobe for help didn't solve the 1 user/computer problem but got me v3.0 UPGRADE for the cost of shipping only ($4.95) Not a bad deal but the same problem still exists. I rate v2.0 and v3.0 as a solid 8 out of 10 for nice features but it's hard to teach old dogs new tricks! :)
4,"I Just Got Two Words To Say(more than two, actually)",Roy Ayers.'NUFF SAID!the sound quality...EXCELLENT!the content therein:.....FUNKY!glad i got it.
4,Excellent,"Wow. I am a major Milt Jackson and Bobby Hutcherson fan, but I have never heard such dexterous vibes playing as Roy Ayers hammers out on Coffy. If I could type like Ayers plays, I'd get a lot more reviews done.This would not mean much if the music was not top notch, but the music is top notch. Ayers vibes provide such a big lush sound, there is no need to puff the arrangements on this soundtrack the way Issac Hayes or James Brown may have. If you noitce, besides quicksilver Ayers, there is only a basic rhythm section here and a horn or two, and the arranging is actually reletively bare bones.But Ayers has such a great musical sense, he can orchestrate well with very few instruments. This dates well, and works as an album: though this is a movie score, it does not have that false grandure many try to add to film musicFunk fan, music fan, film fan, Starbucks fan. Get Coffy. Get it today."
5,Dysfunction,"I think that Crease is an awesome band. I actually got to see them live about a year ago and they rocked hard. I have their ""sample CD"" and it's very good, so Dysfunction must be Fantastic! I suggest you buy it!"
3,pretty average,"I bought this CD just to hear Frustration and I wasn't disappointed by the it. The first 7 tracks of the album are quality, including yet another cover of 867-5309/Jenny. I've found I just cant listen to the last half of the CD. They have the sound of a great hard rock band come 20 yrs too late. Might want to wait before buying to see if they can put out another one..."
3,Frustrating,"The songs ""Frustration"" and ""Jenny"" are definitively great. But the rest of the album is a little bit disappointing..."
2,imprecise,The main problems with this angle finder stems from the nut that holds the two pieces of plastic together. The nut protrudes from the underside so you can't put the ruler flat against a surface which prevents you from drawing a straight line or getting perfectly lined up on the angle. The nut loosens as you change the angle so you have to keep tightening it. This tool is good for rough measurement for wood cutting perhaps but not for any sort of drafting where accuracy is important. It could probably be cheaper for the construction as well.
1,Not worth the Money!,"Flimsy and cheap feeling. Hard to lock the angle and very hard to read. No more than 1/2 degree of accuracy. Should not cost more than a couple of dollars. Two pieces of flimsy plastic, held together by a brass wing-nut.Go with one of the metal, digital options, like the iGaging 15"" Digital Protractor With 12"" Rule. That is what I ended up buying, and totally loved it. Solid, metal, with large and easy to read digital readout."
3,Gets Job done but for how long?,"Bought this to find angles in Human Joints while lifting weights and exercising to help understand the movements I teach to clients better. Didn't want to spend big bucks, so I got this but the plexiglass is pretty thin and flimsy. It'll serve its purpose and overall I'm happy with it but I don't see it lasting very long."
2,Angle Measurement Too Small to See,The small angle measurement at the pivot end is extremely small and is very difficult to see with the naked eye. You will need very bright workshop or to place it against a bright light in order to see the small font. The tool is very accurate however. There are multiple alignment lines to allow you to do layout.
3,Book - Warthog,My husband ordered the book and apparently he liked it. He is an avid reader and new to Kindle so he uses my old one and my account. It's all in the family.
4,Ugly Duckling,Very interesting story about an initially unloved plane that found its niche in wartime....why do professional senior officers get it so wrong so many times in not seeing the potential in some of these great aircraft...and even after being proved wrong still reduce their numbers when the action stops with no replacement in sight - similar to Harrier - very good description of the daily action.......good read
5,Great book,"I'm a new A-10 pilot, and this book was an outstanding look at the history of the Hog during the war in which it proved itself.Very well written and accurate."
4,History through the eyes of those there,I like history from those that were actually there. This book does a good job of putting you in the seat of the aircraft and fighting the war in an A-10. I especially like the gritty detail of little details like the effort to get the aircraft there and the degree of dedication of those to make it happen. If you like history through the eyes of those that were there you will like this book. John Pitts
2,I love the A-10! I hate this book!!!!!!!!!!!,"if you love books like apache and apache dawn you will be sorely disappointed in this book!!! horribly written and fragmented @ times where you are reading about another situation w/out knowing. it is mostly strategies and names and more strategies and more names! their a few exciting points but those are VERY FEW !it is definitely NOT worth the money! DO NOT buy into the hype that this is a good book, those ppl must be gettin paid to say that... or they Love the strategy and the endlessly mind numbing number of names that may only show once in the book... btw I have read well into the 70% of the book so i know what im talking about..."
5,Read it - it's as simple as that READ IT!,"This is an briliant book, even if you don't like the A-10 (which I love). It tells that story of how a ugly, slow plane became a swan during the Gulf War. You get an understanding of how it must have been to fly the Hog, on missions it wasn't designed for. As I said earlier, if you have just the smallest interest in aviation, you have to read this book, and if you like the A-10 - well then you MUST read this book."
5,Great Book,"This is a very entertaining and informative book. It tells the many interesting stories about the awesome plane, the A-10. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,"Simple, but very valuable message !",The author's message is straightforward and simple; the book learns a couple of very valuable techniques for happiness in daily life; written in a no-nonsense style.Buy this book if you are seeking more authentic happiness in your daily life... you won't be disappointed.
1,"A self-help ""booklet""","I hate to knock a book by someone who has managed to turn his life around. But I think potential readers deserve to know what they are getting. For starters the text is 68 pages. If you eliminate the doubl spacing, the large type, you get about 30 pages equivalent in a typical book. Then there is 90 pages of quotations on happiness by famous authors and people, also double spaced. The book was not edited and you have a lot of stuff like ""your happy because"" when the author means you're happy. Anyone genuinely committed to changing their life will do a lot better with the books and tapes of Anthony Robbins, who is a real pro in this genre. ...."
4,A good start,"I purchased this book because of all the great reviews, and I was a little disappointed because I read it in less than an hour, so it is quite brief. Nevertheless, it is helpful, and if this is your first self-help book, then I would recommend it. However, if you have read anything from Tony Robbins, then you are waisting your money. Overall, it is enlightening and very simple.I dropped one star because it is pricey, and it has many errors."
2,Needed to be edited,"I was very excited to get this book, after reading all the good reviews. I chose to ignore the one written by a person who bascially criticised the entire book.It has a good message, however I must say that the spelling and gramatical errors are quite bad. It does detract from the authors message considerably.If you choose to buy this book, be ready for some slang and some poor editing (if any)."
2,The little guide to spelling and grammar,"I think the book has a great premise and it is written in a very down-to-earth and forthright manner. But I would love to know who did not proofread this book. Maybe I will contact the publisher and get a job working from home, proofreading their books. Nowhere in the book is there a distinction between ""your"" and ""you're"". I don't find this a difficult distinction to make, but apparently the proofreader did. There were many other spelling and grammar errors too, but that was the most consistent. I don't mean to be nit-picky, but it did take away from the book for me and was most annoying. I can see one or two errors, but throughout the whole book? The book is a well-meaning book, but definitely not worth the money charged for it."
5,Sweet and Simple,"Kevin's book is great! I've read a few Dalai Lama books, but this one takes the cake on capturing how to enstill happiness in your life. No philosophies, no theories, it's real. You can read in inside of an afternoon and you walk away feeling on top of the world. Part of the reason I liked the book so much is that it was so practical and applicable to situations you hae everyday. Dalai Lama books are a little pie in the sky, and need a few gaps to be filled in by the reader to get to the same level. Good stuff!"
2,"Title should be ""How to make money writing a book""","Like many of the other reviews of this books, I was disappointed. I bought the book thinking that it would provide some wise advice and stimulate some positive thinking. Instead, it got me to thinking that if this guy can write a book, I can too. Over half of the book is quotations on happiness, which means that he wrote only half..."
1,Disappointing,"I have to say I was taken in by the plethora of positive reviews. The book is very poorly written. The author is forthcoming about his lack of any education but seems almost resentful in his dismissive approach to those in the same field who actually possess some formal training. Though the apparent intent of this book is commendable, it falls far short of its mark. I love reading real stories of common people rising above obstacles to find redemption, this reads more like one long, arrogant whine."
2,He has written such better books,"To me, Doug Allyn is one of the many underrated authors. I have enjoyed everything he has written, but this is not my favorite. These are not sensitive, new age cops; these are hard-bitten, street-smart, been-there-done-that cops. The dialogue, language and racial slurs are explicit but realistic. Garcia is a Viet Nam vet who accepts that he and his African-American partner were hired to fill ethnic quotas. My biggest problem was his absolute conviction that he knew who the killer, even though evidence didn't support it. The actual killer comes as a surprise, but it was a twist that just didn't feel right. I did enjoy the reason for the book's name, though. I believe this was his debut novel, and it shows. I'd recommend skipping the two Lupe Garcia books and move straight to Mitch Mitchell."
5,MInn Kota MKA 23,I keep my boat at a storage facility so I cannot keep gear on my boat. This mount was extremely easy to install and allows quick instalation and removal of my motor!
1,"Weak, but mildly amusing","If you can get past the over-the-top exagerations, you might even finish this book.Example (pages 57 & 58):""The most gut-wrenching loss I personally experienced was a $10 million betting disaster when I was 17.""""They were all kingpins, sitting on ridiculous cash surpluses.""""They played, as did I, soley with C-notes...""""The pot was brewing, $30 million strong...""$30 million is the equivilent of 300,000 C-notes...just how big was the table?"
1,A waste of money,"This ghetto dude glorifies a life of pimpin,druggin,and other illicit business's he spends about 2 pages in the book talking about his so called new profession as a life coach and mentor. I saw him on the news show fox thing in the morning in chicago and from the title of the book and his so called conversion from being a thug to being an honest businessman made me want to support the brother, but after reading this book I wished I had saved my money!I get the impression he is still probebly doing stuff that is illegal and his story is not one I would want my children or anyone I know imulating! Life Coach? Pulezze! There are alot of hardworking folks who grew up poor and made it without all of the activities he is glorifying in this book. This book is a waste of money!artj"
5,A nugget from the Golden Age,The story concerns a wealthy newspaper man yielding to corruption to save face and protect his son. Great performances through out this noir gem.
4,A masterpiece,"A masterpiece of the calibre of One Hundred Years of Solitute and The Unbearable Lightness of Being - according to the covertext of the Dutch translation. So not exactly light reading material, but rural Chinese horrors so accurately descibed that I think the book should come with a warning. The plot is gripping and the prose flows easily - not as heavy on the reader as the long sentences and philosophical reflections of the above mentioned masterpieces can be. The fact that the end of the story leaves one wondering can be either good or the only bad thing about the book - I am still wondering. This book should be read by anyone who is interested in history and the dark side of humanity in general."
2,A tedious novel,"It was boring and repetitious, and contained too much violence. It had far too many descriptions of red sorghum fields. Hey--I get the symbolism"
1,Red.Fiasco,"I jumped into this book with enthusiasm and high expectations. Dispointment to say the least, the word sorghum is reiterated to the point it annoys sometimes it goes to 4 times in a single page. The story it's not interestin at all and so far and do not see the magical realism of García Márquez nor Steinbeck's narrative; could be a lousy translation the one to blame but I wouldn' recommend this book find it mediocre especially when you have Haruki Murokami as a reference and competitor for the Nobel price."
1,WARNING: PUKE-INDUCING GRAPHIC VIOLENCE,"THIS IS A WARNING, NOT A REVIEW!!! altho' a mature professional historian of east asia, familiar with the japanese war in china, i could NOT read this book because of the horrific graphic descriptions of unspeakable cruelties, including to animals. a great disappointment, as i dearly wanted to. it seems to be beautifully written and historically accurate. but a warning should be prominently displayed on the cover. it is not the sort of violence one can skip over, either, as in ""dum-de-dum-dum, here comes the murder, let's skip to the detectives coming in,"" but is instead tightly woven into the fabric of the narrative thru'out. i do not mean to malign this work, but only to issue a necessary warning to the average person with the average sort of stomach. only guts of steel can tolerate this."
5,Terrifyingly Beautiful,"This book evoked a time and place that was unknown to me. The farmers tending the sorghum and the wine makers lived contentedly. The pastoral illusion of the first part of the book quickly gave way to unimaginable horror, violence, and cruelty. Sections of the book were nearly impossible to read - but this is not a book to be set aside. Red Sorghum combines humor, violence, poignancy, love and history in one slim novel. Highly recommended - NOT FOR THE FEINT of HEART. If this is the only reference you have of the Japanese invasion of China - you will finish the book very angry at the Japanese. This is a part of world history very few Americans know anything at all about."
5,Deserved the Nobel Prize for the author,The book is a wonderful story. China comes alive. Mo Yan (Guan Moye) was a good choice by the Nobel Committee.
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I never thought that I would give a Nobel Prize winning author and a highly acclaimed novel two stars. However, the story was just one description of horrible, disgusting, sickening acts of violence after another during the 1930s in China when they were invaded by the Japanese and also engaged in civil war. I don't normally have a weak stomach, but after about 100 pages of it, I just tired of it and put the book back on the shelf. I would have given it one star, except that there were some beautifully written descriptions (as beautiful as the others were ugly) of the countryside around the small village where the story takes place. Clearly, Mr. Moyan is a very talented writer, and perhaps the Nobel prize was deserved based on his other writing.Boyd Lemon-Amazon author"
1,Needs a new translation,"Perhaps this is a great novel, but the translation is awkward and crude, without any grace or literary appeal. The story seems to have vast scope and interest and offers meaningful insight to a certain time (1930s) and place (China), but the translating is too off-putting."
4,My Review of Mo Yan's Red Sorghum,"I read Red Sorghum by Mo Yan and translated by Howard Goldblatt about five years ago.It is unforgettable and beautifully translated, though not an easy read as Mo Yan writes about a grandmother in the voice of her grandson, so the time shifts are sometimes jarring. Most of the story is in flashback. I have not seen the film.However, many scenes are unforgettable.A great work of international literature.Yes, I don't usually like to read ""Chinese"" or ""Burmese"" or whatever fiction written by writers who base it all on research, not on life.Red Poppy by Alai, a Tibetan writer who writes in Mandarin, also translated by Goldblatt, is also excellent.Kyi May Kaung"
1,Unremitting violence,"This was a book group choice based on reviews, and proved to be a mistake. There was little to like; the writing is often over-heated, the insistent repetition of the central image tiresome and the explicit violence sickening. As a group we all enjoy fiction set in foreign lands, but this was a disappointment. The background story was interesting, but it was obscured by the style."
4,"Review of ""The Bowhead Whale""","""The Bowhead Whale"" is the product of two decades of intensive research on the bowhead whale. The subjects range from fossil history, reproduction, population size to Alaskan Native subsistence whale hunting. Several of the chapter authors are very well established cetacean scientists. John Burns did an excellent editing the volume and has added useful summary and integration of the chapters. Burns has been active as a marine mammal biologist in Alaska for over 30 years and has ""trained"" under Inuit hunters as well. His experience with and understanding of these remarkable whales (and arctic marine biology) makes for a unique contribution to the scientific literature."
5,Capturing & Preserving the Beatles in 1964,"This delightful book about the Beatles' meteoric arrival in America in 1964 is extremely well written. The nonpareil photographs make a good thing even better still. Benson had the unique advantage of traveling with the Beatles and capturing them up close and personal. Readers will delight at the boyish fun the Beatles had; they were really big children in those days. The ideal companion book to this one isThe Beatles: A Private View. If you loved Benson's book, you will also love Larry Kane'sTicket to Ride: Inside the Beatles' 1964 and 1965 Tours That Changed the World. Kane was a reporter who got to travel with the Beatles during their heyday and had wonderful anecdotes as well as photographs to share.I give this a hearty endorsement and a resounding yeah, yeah, yeah! I love it and have an autographed copy!"
3,not for pool startup!,"The jury is still out on this one. It probably will work well after the pool is stabilized.This is not the product you want to start with however. Get some ""Phos free"". Get a lot!My Phos levels were @ 10,000. It took 2.5 liters of phos free and I am betting that wasn't enough.the ""pool perfect / phos free"" is meant to be used once you have the phos level below 300."
1,This doesn't work,"Don't waste your money. To keep your pool clean, this is not going to help. I used it for a month and didn't have a bit of improvement. Having the right chlorine level and a clean filter works."
5,Amazing,"I use this, Ozone, and Chlorine at less than 1/3 the dose, and no algaecide. I don't like green hair, chlorine smell or the nasty chemicals in algaecides. Use a phosphate test kit and balance the pH. If you have a lot of phosphate, use the commercial phosfree concentrate.Pool water is fresh, virtually oderless, and crystal clear. No algaecide foam or ring. Simple once a week use, an additional dose after a big rain, and your are set for the summer. NO mustard, black or green algae.I have a 30,000 gal vinyl liner pool and have used this product for 5 years. I like this combo better than salt based systmes, and much better than routine algaecides."
1,Don't Bother,"Product did not work. Compared to other products we have tried, the cleaner wasn't effective. Get something else."
5,works wonderfully,Ive been using this pool perfect plus phos-free for 3 years and never had a algae problem and water is sparkling clear and it has actually made the water feel softer. i HIGHLY reccomend it and give it 5 stars!!!
4,lyrical writing -- an unusual book,"I bought _The Dead of the House_ in 1973 because I'd read excerpts from it in _The New Yorker_. Of course, the experience of taking it off the shelf (and noting that I paid $5.95 for it) was like holding a version of myself twenty-vice years ago. The book has a curious structure -- long passages of it are presented as the grandfather reading from the family history he wrote. I wish the ""coming-of-age"" aspect of it had been given more emphasis. The narrator's relationship with the doomed Dirk does recall a simpler, more innocent but at the same time more sinister era in the annals of young love. The sketch in _Contemporary Authors_ indicated that Ms. Green was at work on two more autobiographical novels, both of which had titles but neither of which evidently, was ever published. Readers who liked this book might enjoy _Hula_ by Lisa Shea -- same theme, same style, but dark dark dark"
5,"Excellent book, sadly out of print","I finally found a copy of this rare book that I could afford!William Hung has translated over 300 of Tu Fu's poems in prose style along with fascinating biographical information. Published by Harvard University Press, it is sad that this book (1951) has been out of print for so long.A word in defense of Hung's prose translations: They flow naturally, as opposed to the kind of translation that attempts to square off the lines to make it into ""poetry."" Further, Tu Fu's intent and naturalness of worldview comes through clearly in Hung's version.There have been several more recent books translating poems of Tu Fu (sometimes spelled Du Fu), and some are quite good in their own way. One is well advised to read many different translations of Tu Fu to get a better overall impression of his work."
1,Requires online subscription,"This product could be great, but to access the information required for students to complete the tasks, you need a paid subscription to the publisher's online database. If you really wanted to use these activities I suppose you could compile your own resources for each one, web-based or otherwise, but that sort of defeats the purpose of these DBQ compilations in my opinion. Subscription requirement should have been in the product description. If your school already subscribes to Greenwood's Daily Life Through History, then this might be worth it."
3,could be better,"Ive used this Choate flashider on my Mini 14 and Im not too thrilled. No matter how i tightened the set screws, including using a loctite and drilling a set hole on the barrel, the device loosened. At one point, it blew right off the gun. But its a good product and choate is a reputable company. Which is why for the life of me I cant figure why Choate didn't drill a pin hole to fit the mini14's factory mount scheme. For that matter, why hasn't ANYONE simply made a standard m14/Garand/carbine military sight just by itself."
4,Boyz and Girlz United,"If you like pop music you'll love Boyz and Girlz United first CD! I saw them in concert and they can even perform these songs so well. Yet their music is amazing, try their new single Messed Around for a good listen."
5,teen pop at its best!,"THE ALBUM BY BOYZ N GIRLZ UNITED IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS BY A GROUP OF YOUNG TEENS THAT I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG LONG TIME. THE EMPHISIS IS NOT SO MUCH ON THE HOT BOYS NOR THE SEXY GIRLS BUT ON THE AWESOME MUSIC THAT THEY DO MAKE TOGETHER! THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE WITTY FOR EXAMPLE ""MESSED AROUND"" AND LYRICALLY SMART SUCH AS ""LIGHT OF MY LIFE"" THERE COULD BE NO BETTER ALBUM... PERSONALLY I OWN THREE... ONE FOR MY CAR ONE FOR MY ROOM AND ONE FOR PARTY USE! I SUGGEST IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS ALBUM YOU ARE IN NEED OF PICKING IT UP REALLY SOON BECAUSE OF ITS CATCHY DANCE SONGS AND ITS SMART LYRICS!"
4,Boyz N Girlz United,"The Boyz N Girlz United CD is great to dance to. It is fun to listen to, and it has a wide variety of styles of music. The singing is great, and the remixes of ""Messed Around"" at the end are also amazing. I love the new BNG CD, and I think any other pop music fan would enjoy it too."
2,...whats this crap!,"I cannot believe I bought this album!If you like this bull then you'll love raze! Let me tell you good boy and girl groups: 2gether, backstreet boys, boyszone etc...naaa, Ill be serious, the english popstars, Hearsay are quite good, but back to this joke of an album. The harmonies are to frequent and contain so many voices that it sounds out of tune, and if thats the effect you want then please think about the about the public first!The only reason they get 2 stars is because I'm afraid I have to admit that there are 2 outstanding tracks :""messed around"" and ""thats what you get"". If I'm nice I suppose that the songs that sound familiar to every willa ford track, or britney spears song, are okay, but I'm not gonna be nice! This album was made for 3 year olds that dont know the difference between good and bad music."
4,~~tizight Music for pop luvers~~~,"Great and sweeeet CD. Boyz-N-Gilz are the best CD n e 1 could buy if u luv pop music! Otherwise , how bout looking in the JUNK section?! lol, hahaha, j/k!"
3,GOOD MUSIC,"This cd is pretty good for a group i've never heard of.I was in Walmart and saw this cd and said i'll try this cd out cause the cover looked cool with the two boys and girls,it's something different.I must say though these are great songs but there vocals could use a little more touching up.The cd is well worth your money.Songs i like are lifetime,beautiful you,messed around,dance with me, those are my faves but im a 15 year old boy into all types of music from jay-z to n'sync to foxy brown to mya i like it all{except rock;korn,bizkit etc]so hope you like my review one love"
5,this cd rocks,i thought that this cd was great i can't stop listning to it...i love to sing the songs too........they have great beats and nice lyrics...i saw them perform last summer on the a concert special and fell in love with their musi...and eagerly awaited their cd....i first heard the cd from my best friend when we were going to the nsync concert and i was hoping that b&g were going to open...but they didn't it was okay thought i bough there cd and can't stop listning to it.
2,Too Bad,"This DVD did not deserve to be on the market for sale. The quality of the sounds, and camera are veryyyyyyyyy poor. After all the years of career from La Guzman this is not a really good move from her. The fans deserve something better with high quality. Anyway I recommemd her La Guzman album from Cancum Live 1996 or 1997, which is a great concert."
3,it's ok,I was excited to receive this DVD and a bit disappointed after watching it. The DVD itself is good. It includes an exclusive interview and 3 videos with 2 versions of the song diablo.I was a bit disappointed with the performance itself. The crowd didn't seem too energetic and at times it seemed like it dragged on.Worthwhile if you're a real fan.
5,Pelican Padded Divider Set for the 1550 case,"Ordered the 1550 case with the ""pick n pluck"" foam but after working with it for awhile, realized that I should have ordered it with the padded divider set for the camera. The pick n pluck foam is a nice concept and would work fine for basic shapes but not complex shapes. Tore loose to many pieces just removing and replacing the camera, lenses and accessories during the first week of use. Static electricity is an issue with the foam too. The padded divider is well made and provides a much more flexible arrangment too."
5,Wonderful & Unique,"I was very happy to find a copy of this album. It is a great combination of Andrew Lloyd Weber's musicand the wonderful talent & unique arrangements of Frank Pellico, my favorite organist."
5,A Different Kind of Black Metal,"This band took me by surprise. By looking at the cover I thought this band would be heavy but not like this.Check out their myspace at [...] if you want to hear them.World of Malice is definitely one of my favorite songs along with in anguished verse. This band sounds like a darker version of Dark Tranquility and deserve more than some praise. They have a dark, creepy touch to their music and are very heavy. Also another positive is that most of their songs are around 7 minutes long so you can rock out to your favorite songs for a long time."
2,Monotonous and unmelodic,"Having heard much good about L.S.G. expectations were high, but I was rather disappointed when I first heard this album.All the tracks sound almost alike and are cut in the same way. A rythm section starts out and soon the ever-present 4/4 bass drum kicks in, mixed much too loud to my taste. Slowly, a few attempts at melody are added, then a few chords, and the thing just goes on an on. More layers of sound are added every twenty or thirty seconds, but the structure of each track never changes.There's no melodic variation on the tracks, and most of them seem to go on and on forever.This is the sort of album which gives techno a bad name. Play this for an outsider, and they'll get all their prejudices confirmed: Annoying bass drum, monotonous, unmelodic music that goes on forever.May I instead recommend Another World by Astral Projection, I.F.O. by Pleiadians, or Sky Input by Filteria?"
1,"If you want something other than the DK, try spoken word, or Lard, or No Means No, or DOA, or Mojo Nixon, or . . .","I love Jello. Be it with Lard or the Dead Kennedys or No Means No. But . . .His lyrics here are horrible. They're plenty bitter, but not that intelligent. The Melvins didn't really know what to do with a singing style other than the voice as another instrument style of Buzzo. But hey, that's just my opinion."
2,Amazon's Swisher Molded Front Cargo Basket 2904,"Amazon describes this basket to be eight inches high which is the right height for what I intended hauling. The basket actually is four and one half inches high on the outside with only a three and three quarter inch inside wall height. Also, I expected this basket to fit my rack better as it was pictured on the same Honda Rancher I own. The front basket indention did not fit under the front rack's raised front bar as pictured."
5,great!,"Cioran has a great style, indebted to Nietzsche, in which he raves cynically, a la Schopenhauer, about life. Definitely worth reading.Also recommended: Toilet: The Novel by Michael Szymczyk (A Tribute to the Literary Works of Franz Kafka)"
3,Lacking in Horror,"Although the skepticism is entertaining, there is a lack of horror that reduces the authenticity of the stance. There must be some source of fear as the foundation for respect, such as physical pain, but even this is casually brushed aside as temporary and fleeting under the guise of a non-religious buddhahood. To scoff at everything becomes eventually flat and boring, leaving the author no room for dynamism or even roundness of emotional response."
4,Glass half empty?,While not the most optimistic of writers on life's alternative philosophies Cioran is probably the most effective at portraying the 'glass half empty' point of view. His main thought is to suggest we should have been better off not to have drunk a drop from our glass in the first place. The hard fact that it is too late now for any of us to backtrack from the fountain of life is one that he bemoans at some length and should give us all at least a measure of resignation about what is left in the dregs of our totally depressing and pointless existence.
5,An overlooked masterpiece,"This is one of the finest books I've ever read, a masterpiece of 20th century European lit. As with only the very best literature, you will know yourself better after reading it, and then you'll want to read it again."
2,PADDED,"I DO BELIEVE THIS ""FOAM PADDING"" IS OVER PRICED if there was more or the price was lower, it would have been purchased"
5,"This is Wonderful, but please reproduce SCREEN SCENES on CD","I have most of these songs by Nero on other albums -- they are great. However, I don't understand why Screen Scenes is not available on CD. Will it ever be? It has so many wonderful movie scores. I want it so badly! Please help.Ginny Albert"
3,Dummies for Vista,Did not do much good as Vista was so bad! So we got rid of Vista an the book with it but the Dummie book have always helped me at times.
1,fore dummies,"Book is for dummies and is of virtually no use to the new ""stupid"" user unfriendly Vista."
3,"Disappointed, sort of","I love the quality of the pictures of the final projects and the overal quality of the book presentation. However, I did not like the ""refer to page [x]"" for the step-by-step techniques in each project and the pictures of the steps did not help much. Every technique is not the same from project to project. It seemed a lazy approach to the book layout. Other than that is was OK."
2,The Most Uninspiring Book in My Library,"I am relatively new at altered art, so I thought this book would be a good one for me. Sadly, I am grossly disappointed. How ugly the majority of the projects are! Many of them look like an elementary school child would have no problem completing them. The projects in this book were just not anything I would qualify as ""Art."" I only gave it two stars for the nice photography."
4,End game...,"Those who've bought the one's before know what they're buying now. For the newbies out there curious, buy the first one. First."
4,my new camera,"i love the camera it takes good picture it's just to big for my wifes pursebut for what i wanted it for is to take close up pictures on my wedding for the guest book but i get marry in april so until then i cant say, yet i did do some trials and the printer work so good and the pictures came out lovely, and clear, so she's happy with the camera for that part, but if you want a camera to carry around maybe you got to get a smaller one besides that,it's a good buy"
4,Excellent!,"Amazing sound for the Camaro which is difficult to find in my opinion. The set looks great as well, although I will say that the tips stick out a bit too far for my liking. I was hoping they would be flush with the bumper but since they have the Magnaflow tag imprinted on the tip I assume they want it to be seen.Easy install as well"
4,This is a GOOD album,The CD is raw and has great music. I saw these guys play awhile back at a crazy dive called the White Rabbit. They put on a hell of a show. Too bad it's the only album they've got around. It's a great listen.
1,Very Stale,"I received this as a gift for my birthday, and as impressive as it looks, the products inside are pretty bad tasting. All the chocolates tasted stale, and were of bad quality. The additional candy is very cheap and not impressive. I felt bad throwing it out."
1,You'll Be Embarressed If You Send This,Rocky Mountain Chocolate TowerThis package arrived today and I am debating telling the sender how bad it was. Mostly packaging. The chocolates tasted stale. A few nuts...
5,Wonderful,I have to admit I was a little hesitant in sending this to my mom for Mother's Day. There were so many mixed reviews from most of the Wine Country Gift Baskets. My mom got it a few dasy before Mother's Day (which is better than after I guess. She absolutly loved it. Everyone said how lucky she was to have such a thoguhtful daughter. So Yay!! I am thrilled and I will order from WCGB again!
1,Bad gift,We received this last year and it was tastless. It looks very pretty but the contents are terrible. I do not recommend this as a gift.
4,Delicious Chocolates!,The caramels were great. This was a great gift for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day - she loved it!
4,Volume 2,"As in the rest the printed shirt is a bit dissatisfying, although this one is a bit fun, considering what's on it, the 5th or 6th grade bathing suit. Maybe it'd be too weird if this one had a real bathing suit in it :P But in its defense I'd have to say this one has my favorite CD, although it gets a lot of competition from Volume 1 but is my favorite as it's easier on the ear.Well worth the price"
2,Re: Fire and Ice,"Mr. Storz of Hanover Park, IL should read the review from M. Michaels of Everett, WA. If you are a long time BlackHawks fan you would have immediately realized the organ in FIRE and ICE is NOT the Stadiums 6/51 Barton's theatre pipe organ, and that it was not even the Stadium.Regards,Sam Yacono...Steger, IL...03/21/04"
5,Fire & Ice-Chicago Stadium Organ,"As the last recording ever made on the historic Chicago Stadium Barton Theatre Pipe Organ, Al Melgard protegee Frank Pellico brings out the best in the organ through his selection of songs for this CD. The distinct deep, throaty bass notes literally ""move"" you when you goose-up the volume. The Barton's unique Xylophone and Chime sounds are featured in several songs. As a long time Chicago Blackhawks hockey fan, my personal favorite track on this CD is Pellico's rendition of ""Here Come the Hawks"", originally composed in 1968 by Dick Marx & his Orchestra. This CD is definitely a MUST for any fan of the now defunct Chicago Stadium!!"
3,Sort of works.,"I have not been able to find this product in stores for years. When I finally decided to search the Internet for it, it was more expensive than I had remembered (plus shipping), but I needed it again for itchy scalp and dandruff. It's reduced both conditions."
1,i used sulfur ointment from the vermont country store,"The sulfur ointment from the Vermont country store works great, and it is doesnt smell, and it not greasy......it worked on my scalp the very first time.......its by a company called Ge"
2,Way too Cheap. Not easy to fill with candy or anything else. Did not work well.,I think the above speaks to the rating. This is an awful product. We had to cut a hole in it to fill it and the strings did not properly open the bottom. Perhaps we got a dud.
3,"Pretty, but seems of lesser quality","My husband and I decided to collect some copper molds to hang in the kitchen (as our grandmothers did when we were children). We found good, sturdy molds at the nice cooking store (located in nice malls), and purchased those. We weren't able to find any fish shapes or heart shaped molds and I discovered this one for sale here on Amazon. It is a nice little heart shape, but the copper isn't near the quality or thickness of the molds from France, and it's a very shallow mold, so it wouldn't be functional. I would estimate it's about 3/4 of an inch thick. It is hanging with the nicer molds, and from a distance you can certainly tell it's not of the same quality, but it's shape is it's redeeming quality (a lovely heart)."
3,"Unfortunately, I underestimated its size.","This product is quite small. I wanted it for a jello mold, not happening. Pretty in color for hanging rack"
2,Bad but in a Good Way,"GI Bro: This movie has nothing to do with blaxploitation except that one of the characters is a black guy. The same cast also seems to have made Real Soulja, another mis-labled flick making the rounds on these budget dvds. Bad movie, bad acting, bad title.Black Ninja: If you like cheesy ninja movies where people can do magic flips and dissapear and have big goofy headbands clearly labled ""NINJA"" this is for you.. If you're looking for a serious hard hitting ""brother-on-the-edge"" type flick.. well, nothing in this set is for you.Soul Brothers of Kung Fu: The plot is hard to follow, the action wasn't very impressive nor does it go for the campy style of Dolemite, so I was mostly bored, but if you're bothering to look at this set it's probably worth the few bucks. This version features first a cut then an additional uncut ending. The uncut is a little graphic but nothing modern audiences haven't seen. At least it lives up to it's title, unlike GI Bro.."
3,Fun/boring,First off Jennifer it is not this to toy could be funner it is this toy could be more fun. I bought this head so i could cut/styleher hair.When i try to do Sasha's makeup it gets boring and it scarcly shows up on her.I like bratz and this toy is fun hairwise.IF you like doing hair i recommend this item!
1,a huge head that is creepy. sure thats a great idea.,ok um all of these ''heads'' are super creepy!!! i am a fan of bratz but NOT huge bratz heads. i mean heads. come on.i really do not recomend this toy . i would not buy this toy if i were you
4,Very Soothing And Fun,"Since I have an African American family, this is the closest Ethnic Bratz doll I could find. But my daughters will play with any kind of Bratz, they are fanatics! I bought this for them in early November, when their report cards came home and they got good marks. They share one, but that's alright, because they don't usually play with it 24/7 at the same times.My daughters undid her ponytails and clips, and now her hair is pretty mangled up, but she can do some really fancy hairdo's when they feel like it. I don't say it's educational, but not every toy has to be. This is one for just relaxing. It's soothing sometimes, to just braid and braid your Bratz's hair until your stresses are gone. It's durable, except for sometimes the hair comes out, and if you leave her makeup on for too long it gets cakey and flakey. I reccomend it four stars."
5,Sasha the Bratz Funky Fashion Makeover doll; COME GET IT!,"This hip, cool doll is on stylish chick! With her shimmery bronze lip colour and her exotic features this doll is sure to keep you entertained! Wether brushing, combing or braiding her dark hair you are sure to have fun! This great product is defiantly a two thumbs up!"
3,Packaging problem.,"Just got this in the mail. Keep in mind that this packaging has both a shrinkwrap and one of those little sticker labels on the top of the CD case to prevent it from being opened. Unfortunately, the sticker will rip off the from and back sides of the CD case, leaving only white fuzz, when you attempt to remove it. You can either deal with having a ripped-up CD case, or you can slip a knife in there and cut the sticker and leave that on there permanently. If you're looking for this CD and like to keep the album cases, then you might want to try getting it directly from the record company in the hopes that it won't put you in this kind of double bind."
1,Fable or fabrication?,"Although Amazon.com's review and the Author's review try to ""sell"" the book, I have read it and am not impressed. But then again, making money is more important than providing a good piece of writing. I agree with writer when s/he comments about the similiarity to Reichert's poem, also titled ""What Love Is"", but only in idea and tone. The poem is autobiographical, dealing with Reichert's first experience with love and the lessons she learns as she grows up about ""What Love Is"". This poem, written in honor of her deceased child - an organ donor, has appeared in many publications. The book by Pearson appears to follow a similiar path but packages it's message in a confusing and disjointed manner."
5,"A simple, moving story","I, too, am saddened by the harsh reviews this lovely work has received. My father gave me this book after my mother passed away and it moved me to tears, primarily because it described so perfectly, in such beautiful, simple terms, their 47-year marriage. Perhaps only those who have shared, and then lost, a great love, along with those who knew them, can be touched by it. Far from being a jumble of ideas, the author captures a lifetime of love in only a few pages. The simple illustrations perfectly complement the prose."
1,Not believable,"As a great-grandmother and widow, I bought this book with great anticipation. It fell far below my expectations and I thought the writing as a jumble of thoughts and memories that were too far fetched to be real. People who don't experience things should NOT write about them or review them. But I guess ""fable"" is in the title and does mean that this is a fantasy, a myth of what a real long term relationship is about. I also found your Editorial Review very biased, but then again, it was written to sell books and make profit. I will definitely keep THAT in mind when buying other books."
1,"Poor writing, lousy story","Got this book for Valentine's Day and didn't think much of it. I've been married 47 years and if this is what my life was about, then I want to start over. I had better stories written by my students when I was a teacher and they didn't get published. Save your money and ""get a life""!"
1,misleading,"This thing is listed as a blender. It purees, chops ice, and all that stuff according to the description. It sounds like a self-contained and complete BLENDER. But it's not, despite its hefty price. It has to be used with other Bosch kitchen machines that cost upward of [$$$]. Otherwise it's worthless. If you want a REAL blender, get one that actually has a motor."
5,Effective treatment for prostate cancer,"I have advanced prostate cancer and have been taking this product for only 1 month and my Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which had been increasing, fell from 12.6 to 11.1 since my last PSA test (2 months ago). I would highly recommend it as a supplementary treatment for prostate cancer."
2,not enough information,"I just read through this book which took me a total of 3 hours tops.Mr Abdo's diet seems plausible but he doesn't give you enough information as to how much food to eat.Nov 24, 2002I reread this book and there is more to it than I originally thought. What at first appeared to be a simplistic plain now seems alot more doable than the Paleo Diet. After re-reading MrAbdo's book, his diet seems more approachable and more realistic."
4,"Interesting, but not enough emphasis on events and facts","The author provides some interesting information not previously revealed about the OKC bombing, investigation, and legal process. However, too much emphasis is placed on his personal challenges for me to rate this book a 5. I highly reccomend The Third Terrorist by Jayna Davis as a compliment to this book for further illumination on the Oklahoma City Bombing."
4,Persons Unknown,"This is a very well written book, well researched, and insightful. Jones as defense counsel could have turned the job down but took the case knowing it would alienate many of his personal and business associates. His ethics in doing so and doing a good job are a credit to the oft-maligned legal profession. While he does not betray any attorney-client discussions, he makes a good case for two unsolved mysteries in the case. How was this financed? How did a fertilizer bomb do so much damage to a modern structure? He never got to the bottom of either, but it seems pretty clear Terry Nichols was the bag man for the operation and there were others involved in this bombing. A very well done book, readable, damning of the federal goverment, and insightful into the hate which was inspired against it by the carnage at Waco."
2,A topic worthy of a better book.,"This book is too poorly written to read and understand. Problems in organization, narrative style and structure, plus an occasionally annoying narrative voice, make it difficult to figure out what is going on. The time sequence is random and much that is irrelevant is mixed in and has to be sorted through.The author's coy refusal to state whether he believes Timothy McVeigh is guilty is negated by McVeigh's own post-conviction confession.Had the author focused on his actual thesis, that Timothy McVeigh did not act alone and probably had the support of some organization, and had he offered well-organized, well-reasoned and well-supported evidence to support this thesis, this would have been a much better book."
2,Just another conspiracy theory to make it more confusing,"To be honest, I am rather biased pertaining to this book. He made a few good points, I will definitely admit to that. But Stephen Jones has also slandered the name of someone I know with the bit of tabloid trash he had to throw in to make it more interesting. I know it's only a personal opinion, but such things should never be published about a living person without any basis of fact. It accomplishes nothing but the destruction of another life."
5,car,This car is so beautiful My grandson loves it and he is only 3 1/2. It is quite expensive though. I bought it when it was cheaper than the selling price now. Amazon sometimes lowers and raises prices. This car has a working radio and clock. My grandson drove it at the lower speed for 10 minutes and then wanted it at the faster speed of 5 miles per hour. He had no trouble controlling it. If you wait until summer is over this car might come down in price.
1,R U Kiddin' Me???,"Who needs to peddle? Now your three-year-old can drive their own icon of excess at speeds up to five miles per hour!With its $349.99 price tag, you can prove to your neighbors that you aren't affected by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.And who cares about the environment, either? Teach your children to love their gas guzzlers; a real life Escalade gets all of fourteen miles per gallon!"
4,Easy and helpful,"This book offered me practical tips to get through what I expected to be a difficult birth. I only read it several weeks before I had my baby, but it worked. I loved the 'anchor' point and my husband did many of the exercises with me, too. I highly recommend this to all pregnant mothers. Best of all, it only took a few minutes a day to use all the advice!"
3,A good begining,"If you do not know alot about air warfare or of modern aircraft in general then this DVD is an excellent starting point. It explains everything in a simple and informative manner. However if you are up on all the comings and goings of modern aircraft then the info will be nothing new. The footage is good, but a little grainy and not up to the quality of DVD. The biggest pain is the way they present the show. I think they were trying to be fancy and show off the interactive features of DVD's. But to stop watching one part to jump to a different section gets annoying. It would have been better to just put it together as one streamlined show. But as it is pretty cheap I think it is worth the cash."
3,GORGEOUS LULLABIES for 'QSA',"The Michael Armstrong ones at the beginning of this series are interesting. This one is beautiful. They are tributes and capture the tone. 'I Think I lost my Headache' often fits perfectly into playlists. Just mining the simplest melody lines is a pretty neat trick. It does send up the alpha waves so has be effective for nap-time at any age. And gets that nice disturbing edge in a gentle way. This and his 'Tool' were my favorites. Grant you, Tool without spectacular drums is hard to envision but he somehow nails that one too."
4,An intense look at the wilderness within and without.,"As in his earlier ""Coasting"", Raban weaves his inner and outer journeys in his classic self-revelatory style. His portrayal of Vancouver's struggles makes a great sub-plot. His descriptive powers zero right in. I've never read a better passage on the fundamental difference between the US and Canada. Raban evokes the spirit of the place and the people in ways that are surprising for just one trip North. His passages about his relationship with his father and daughter Julia are heartfelt and moving. Having spent some years in Southeast Alaska in the early 70's working on the water, it's great to read something other than the typical gushing travel writer's fiction. Raban gives us a very personal glimpse into a unique world. Ranks with McPhee's ""Coming into the Country"" and Edward Hoagland's ""Notes from the Century Before"" as one of the best books about the Alaskan experience as well as a very personal voyage of discovery."
4,Deeply descriptive,"Scholarly, historical and emotional. The author recounts his own loss, love and passage, ending the book with a sad letter written to a friend who had a similar loss (Paul Theroux perhaps?). The journey is up through the `inner passage' of the American North West to Alaska, deeply described in appearance and history, yet interlaced with Raban's usual lyrical portrayal of boats and cruising.Far from being just another sailing and cruising book, it is an emotional read. My most favorite books from this great author."
5,If you beleive that you are drawn to books for a reason...,"This book takes you, at its topmost level, on a journey over a magical sea and wonderful landscapes. In reality it takes you on a journey through vision and viewpoints. How do you see yourself in the world? How quickly does the ""forest"" close in on your life?I came away from this book wondering what hit me. And it was a great feeling."
3,A Passage to Juneau: Evesdropping on Jonathan Raban,"Were it not for Mr Rabans wordsmithing talents, this book would have foundered ten feet from the dock. Simply, there is little here to make a story. A sprinkle of Native Northwestern lore, a fractured reading of Captain Vancouvers log and writings repleat with a smattering of psycoanalysis, and a sub plot of a marriage about to break up on the shoals of Mr Rabans self obsession just do not reward the reader for his efforts. This book gets three stars for Mr Rabans use of language, he's a skilled practicioner. Nevertheless, its a ponderous and tedious read in which not much of the promised transforming self discovery is delivered, and little is learned about this sea."
1,"Drifting, not sailing","The author fails miserable to hold together the historical journey of Vancouver, his current plodding through the inside passage, and his personal family life. Drifting from one to the other I dreaded learning more of this egomaniacs personal life! If the 430 pages had been edited down to 100 dealing with the history of the area, told as he travels through it, it might be a winner. But alas it's not."
1,Boring,"Having traveled the inside passage after graduating from college, I was immediately drawn to the title. After reading reviews I thought I would be in for a real treat. Oh, how I was wrong. This is a very boring narration by a very critical and conceded Jonathan Raban. I only finished the entire book because I felt I was obligated to complete the journey. If you are a big fan of cocktail parties and own a sailboat you may enjoy this book. All I know is that I could not recommend it to anyone and still maintain a clear conscience."
1,Shark Hand Held Vacuum,I purchased this vacuum to replace my Black & Decker that would only work for aprox. 3 minutes before needing arecharge (purchased new in 1999).What a mistake on my part.The Shark vacuum has never been able to pickup anythingwithout going over it many times since new.And yes the bag and cup are empty.Live and learn I guess.
3,Great but...not MAC compatable as advertised,"Guess that sums up my issue with this piece of software. I am able to use it, but only on a borrowed computer. Amazon should correct the product detail information. It is misleading."
5,Punk is cool,"Punk O Rama always delivers, and this one is no exception. Epitaph, Fat Wreck's less poppy, more punky cousin, always puts out great comps, and this one is great, just like the rest. Also, check out POR 2 and 3 for some more great tunes."
4,Great Launching Pad,"I bought this CD second-hand in New Zealand as it was cheap & enabled me to get a snapshot of some bands I hadn't previously heard of. Trapped in the old school of punk (Descendents, DOA, Dag Nasty, Toxic Reasons et al), I am largely out of touch with the myriad of new material available. However, this CD was excellent (save track 15 - 5m 45s of self-absorbed piffle that's about as punk as Bombfunk MC's) & I'd have to say that the Pulley track 'Gone' is as good as you'll ever hear, NOFX are their normal class act and All, Millencolin, H2O, Bombshell Rocks & the Dropkick Murphys have all knocked out songs that inspire me to check them out further."
3,punk o rama,"okay I was dissapointed when I found out ten foot pole wasn't on the album and neither is bad religion but there are some really good songs on it especially the song by NOFX, i can't understand how it could have been cut from pump up the valum anyways go and buy this cd what could be better than a 28 song cd that costs 4 bucks"
5,Finely A Good Punk CD,Hey i wanna tell u that punk o rama vol. 5 is one of the best i have all of them up to 6 and this one is one of the best and its a really good CD and i jugest that u go and get this CD i first got this CD along with some other punk o rama Cd's and this one is jsut really good and jugest u go and get casue its really good
4,Bravo II,Bravo II works great just make sure you do the alignment everytime you change the ink cartridges. If you do it make very impressive full color lables.I had trouble with the color ink cartridge that came with the unit. Good thing I has a spare to try. Primera said they would send me a replacement but I haven't seen it yet.
1,Terrible!,"Bought this book for a friend who's in the graphic design business; all this book does is show you a bunch of fonts on paper, you still have to purchase the fonts through seperate vendors. TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!!!"
3,Not what I expected,"The first half, ""A Boy's Will,"" was better than the second, ""North of Boston."" ABW are romantic poems, about nature, love, and death, in the grand tradition of Wordsworth et al. They ostensibly follow the couse of a boy's life/coming of age.The second half, or second book, I didn't like much. Most of the poems are hardly poems at all; they're more like short stories written with line breaks. Some of the stories/poems were interesting, some I just couldn't care about. There were a few more ""poemy"" poems, like Mending Wall and After Apple Picking, but they're the same poems you find in anthologies, so nothing much gained here.I would guess that Frost published better books than these later in his career."
3,ok but not much saving,I bought this cartridge but it is not a huge saving over the genuine one. I guess it works fine. One time I saw smudge on the paper
1,Good picks+lousy packaging= poor product overall,"The picks I received are fine. The problem is that when I opening the large box in which the picks were shipped, the clear plastic clamshell package that was supposed to hold the 12 pick was open and empty. In rummaging around through the shipping box, I could only find 3 picks. Either I got ripped off and the clamshell only contained 3 picks originally, not the 12 described in the Amazon item, or the other 9 picks fell out of the shipping box (the box was not that well sealed) during transit. Either way, I got cheated. In looking at other reviews of this product, I see that I am not the only one to whom this has happened."
1,4 out of 12 ain't bad?!?!,"I received only 4 out of 12 picks. Amazon sent this in a shoebox size box. Along with the tuner I ordered, it filled up about 10% of the box. The pick packaging came open and 8 of them slipped out. I would have been much better off going to a local shop."
1,Repeated bad reviews for a reason,"NOT a ""multi-pack"" as described. NOT a 12 pack as Im sure the mail man shook his 5 picks worth out of the box (Horribly packaged). Just look at how many people are having the same issues!So here is what you SHOULD do: NOT BUY THESE PICKS!"
1,Poor quality,"I am very disappointed with this purchase as in two sessions I have managed to break about 6 picks (playing an acoustic guitar). The edge breaks off when strumming. I have never had this happen to me in over 20 years of playing. I can understand the odd one or two, but 6 picks!!I'm going back to nylon picks for my next purchase."
4,"cheap enough ,good looking ! yeah they do the job .","i usually prefer some kind of Dunlap , problem there are so many to choice from with them ,i no longer know which of that brand i liked ! with that outfit .back when Freddie fender was still alive fender picks are everywhere in the USA anyway . after CBS bought the company anyway ,fender picks you can find in most if not all musical instrument shops in this country and the standard is the same and the price yes has changed but still one of the more affordable picks around . one mite find picks they like better true ,but fender you know what to expect ."
4,Great price,"It's hard to evaluate standard picks but these are sturdy picks. I go through them a lot so I'm looking for good quality, cheap picks. I'll go back to these folks in the future."
5,Fender Makes Great Plectra,"These Fender 351 Thin Picks are awesome, and you can't beat this price for a pack of 12 of them and the thinness of these is great for a lot of precise picking."
5,Great picks.,I am a beginner and I am very happy with these picks. They have just the right amount of give. Great value too.
5,"Great pick, nice feel","Been using these picks for quite a while for rhythm and acoustic guitar playing. I really like them, and they are cost effective. These picks last long even thought they are thin! No more packaging problems with these picks for those who may be concerned of such."
1,Don't judge a book by its cover,The picture is wrong. You will not get all those colorful picks. You will get 12 plain black picks.
1,picks for Tylers guitar,"I was happy with the picks I got, which were resonable and they came prettyfast and they were my grandsons favorite color. Thanks"
5,DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!,"I received all 12 picks, in a convenient little case. None of them were missing, it did not come open, and they're perfect for me to use. How they could ""escape"" the box is beyond me/. The one thing Amazon always does is make sure the box is closed with enough tape. Some people just love to complain!"
3,DO NOT BUY HERE!,"Don't buy from Amazon. Buy it from Musician's Friend, Sam Ash, anywhere else where they understand how to package small objects like picks. I've already returned and received replacements for packages that were empty or only contained a few picks. They don't ship this in anything less than a children's size shoebox. Anyone who has ever seen or handled these pick packs know how easy they are to open. Well, nobody at Amazon has because they just throw it into a giant box where it rattles around, opens up, and slides out through the seams of the outer packaging. First package was empty. Second attempt contained only a few, which were saved only by adhering to the packing tape on the packaging. I thought I'd save a buck or two using the free shipping on Amazon but forget it! I'm buying from the online stores above or just making the trip to the local guitar shop.Aside from that, I love these picks! I have purchased them for years and will continue to do so....elsewhere."
5,Apparently I got lucky.,"Before I begin this review, I would like to say that 99% of the time I read the reviews before I buy the product.....except this time. I thought, as one reviewer posted, what's there to say about picks. After I ordered them, between the monotony called shipping, I saw the reviews and immediately felt like a fool.Well, not really. I also ordered an amp so I had a big package to begin with, but the picks were in a perfectly sized fender plastic case like you see at the local store. It was also wrapped and placed inside one of those bubble plastic air thingies. You know, in case the pick breaks. I also appear to be in the rare minority who received all 12 picks. But please, don't worry, Amazon messed it up anyway. I received all 12 of the same color picks. I rated it a 5 anyway because they were black picks. And black picks are cool. Had they been the pink hello kitty picks I probably would have been a little upset."
4,"All one color, but shipped fine","The picks I received came in an appropriately sized box for the small container, and none of the picks were missing."
3,if they come,Giant box for a tiny box with the picks scattered all over. Not shipped right. An envelope would have worked better. Amazon is prime for giant boxes for tiny items. Just go to the store and buy some. I received 10 out of 12 picks. Just read all the reviews and be forewarned
1,fender picks,"I ordered the fender picks and the description said there would be 12. There were only 3, what a rip, the picks are nice, but the description of product is very wrong! Whats up Amazon????"
5,Fender 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks 12 Pack Black Moto Medium,"Great value for a 12 pack of high quality guitar picks. These are a lot better than the price suggests. Nice selection of colors, so I am returning now for another two packs in different colors."
2,Bad Packaging,I also only received 7 out of 12 picks and this was suppose to be part of a christmas gift. So slightly upset with thhe results for the first time ever. If anything all you had to do was put a piece of tape around the plastic container. Other than that the black and silver picks are beautiful!!
5,"Fender 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks, 12 Pack, Purple Moto...",The Fender 351 premium guitar picks are great. I bought the medium pick for my comfort zone. The color purple is great looking and made sturdy enough to last for years. Great price and color.
5,"Fender 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks, 12 Pack, Abalone, Thin","Love these picks, pretty much the only ones I buy now, nice and flexible,great for picking, great for strumming. Recommend you try them."
5,top pick!,"it was my pick for a pick. the Fender 351 Premium Celluloid 12 pack -- thin like they said. feels good, lends itself to picking"
1,Terrible packaging,Great product but only received 4 out of 12 as the packaging caused the picks to fall out in transit. Put them in a sealed bag and your won't have the issue.
5,Perfect,I use these with Ernie Ball regular slinkies. I find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles. It's also cheaper.
1,terrible service,i never revived this item.the company said i would get it within a week and i never did. then i contacted them and they said it should come in in the next couple days. i still haven't revived it.
3,A pick is a pick...,"I wanted to experiment with a thin pick. I like the action but thinner picks tend to ""click"" over the strings and I don't care much for that. These are certainly pretty though, and the feel is typical Fender celluloid, smooth and a little slippery. Might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers. Celluloid is highly flammable, so be aware of that if you smoke (I don't)."
3,Missing A Few,Like the above buyer said. This package actually came apart in the package it was shipped in and I ended up only getting 10/12 so taking a star off for each one that was lost in the packaging. All in all this is good set of picks but at the same time they really need to package the contents better.
5,"Nah, nah, nah, nah, naaaaah, nah!","I am one of the few to actually get all 12 picks! See, it is possible! Haha! Losers! =P ...2 more words."
3,"picks great, silly packaging","As others have noted, the little package opens in shipping, and you lose picks. I ended up with 8 out of 12. This could be solved with some scotch tape, so not really forgivable. Luckily, I'm not a serious gigging musician who's always losing picks, but if I were, it could be an issue. Nice picks. :)"
2,Poor Packaging/Shipping Method,I never received the picks because the package was so small that it opened up and all the picks slipped out of the bottom of the box through the small area that was not taped. By the time the box got to my house there was an empty small plastic box and no picks! My recommendation is to just go to a guitar store and get some.
2,Poor Packaging,"Love the picks, but the seller has shipped Medium picks twice when I ordered Thin. On my second try, they shipped Medium picks in a package marked Thin. The items are shipped in a small plastic container that easily pops open within the shipping box. So aside from losing a few during shipment, and not receiving the correct size, these are killer picks."
1,7/12,"The packaging is a big problem here. The plastic shell the picks come in opens during transit and the picks scatter, as pointed out in other reviews. I got seven out of the dozen I ordered, which puts me in the upper-tier of success with this product and this vendor. But beare of the probabilities of not getting your money's worth..."
4,Shipping Disappointment!,"We ordered these picks for my son who is actually very pleased with the product. However, when they arrived in the big box by themselves, instead of being sealed in a zip lock bag or sealed smaller box and included with my other orders, most of them had fallen out. We discovered this by finding a pick out in the yard where the delivery man had walked up to the door. We got only about 5 of the 12 we had ordered and they were identical in color and design... no variation at all. We were VERY disappointed that they were not packaged better for shipping, and we were VERY disappointed that our order was not fulfilled. It is doubtful that we'll order picks or small items from Amazon again."
1,6 out of 12,"Don't do it! So many people report the same problem. Sounds like a good deal up front. The reality is, I got 6 out of 12 picks in the box. Like many many other reviewers report, the picks come out of their package and then I guess they slip out of the box. Might as well just go to your local store and buy them."
1,"I repeat the others, poor, I mean poor packaging!","As many have said before and that I ignored..the packaging is horrendous! The box was HUGE and the picks were floating loose in the box. They had fallen out of the flimsy Fender case they were in. A piece of scotch tape would have fixed this! The first time they sent it to me I only got 7 of the 12 picks. The sent a replacement shipment and all 12 were there but only by luck. They too were floating around the box. Oh well, guess I'll stop being lazy and go get these locally. lol Great looking and performing pick though!"
5,Great (don't worry about the packaging anymore),The picks came in a factory sealed fender signature package which was great because it showed that the company saw those past negative reviews and rectified their poor packaging.
5,"Nice picks, nice price!","What can I say about a pack of guitar picks? Nice picks, nice price, quick delivery, perfect weight and thickness!Oh, and they actually work great with my guitar! Now all I need is guitar lessons and another twenty or so yearsand I'll be an awesome 75 year old rock star!! Ok, maybe not, but I still like these picks!"
1,where are the rest?,"I rec. my pkg. today with the fender guitar picks and the mandolin strings. Strings pkg. was fine and am sure the quality of strings will be ok. The picks, on the other hand,very dissatisfied. Simply because I only got three(3) out of the twelve(12) picks that were supposed to be in the pkg. Where are all the rest?"
5,Perfect,"My boyfriend absolutely loves the picks! And the original set that I had ordered had gotten lost in the mail, I am guessing because of the holiday rush, and they sent me another set no problem! I will definitely buy from them again."
4,Great!,"Love this pics and the cool designs on them. Fast, affordable, and worth all the money. Definitely recommend this product."
2,Bad Shipping,My package came in a big box and all the picks were scattered all over. The bottom was also not sealed so probably some of the picks fell from the box. Total disappointment for shipping
1,Just horrible service,"This item shows several differnt designs. I recieved the same color on all 11, not 12. Packaging was done in a very large package for a small box container these picks. The small box containing the same color picks came open and loose picks were scattered thoughout the much larger package. Must have lost a pick to due this issue. This issue has been brought up in previos complaints and apparently Amazon can not make it better. Go through someone else if you want this item."
5,Very good service,These were exactly what we wanted. They were really friendly over the phone. We plan on buying from them again.would recommend to anyone wanting guitar stuff.
5,Fender 351,"Great feel and look cool to boot. It's Fender, what more can I say ?!? Looks like marble and plays like butter. !!"
1,poor amazon advertising,"you see the picture and it looks like a group of multi color picksdefaults to black. thought i was getting 12 picks in multiple colors like the pic, no you must pick the color which either i didnt or messed it up with the mousedissatisfied"
4,"fender packing not good, but I got all 12 !!!!!","I got these in the mail today. Opened the box and the Fender clamshell package had come open and the picks were loose all over the box. This is not Amazon's fault, it is Fenders. But after checking the box and lifting the flaps I found all 12 yeah! The picks are nice and I am happy that I got all of them though many apparently did not. I think if Fender would tape the edges of the package it would not come open. Also it would be cool if these picks were in an assortment of colors like is pictured in the photo. Overall I am happy with the order."
5,Great Picks!,"These are pretty good guitar picks. I usually get them at Guitar Center, but I had no idea they were so cheap on Amazon! The Mediums seem just about the perfect size and hardness for me, and the colors are probably the best part. The names have worn off some of them (I play a lot!), and they're a tad worn down, but they're the most durable picks I've used."
1,Poor at best,I regret to inform those of the terrible service this company and or website offers. I made an order over a month ago...still no package. You have used up all my patience and in the future I will be taking my business elsewhere.
1,Buyer beware: missing picks!,"I was shocked to open this box, ordered from amazon, and see 3 empty containers! With a couple of loose picks in the box (I ordered 36). I thought the other feedback must have been a fluke but it's true. I requested a replacement but received an email from Amazon stating they would issue a refund instead of replacement because item was ""out of stock"", which it's not. So much for turning to amazon for gift buying :/Update: I had to re-order these & the key is order this item with other items that are big enough to limit movement of the pick package in the box = less pick loss."
4,Very Nice,This pick is very good. I got my son these picks so he could start playing his guitar. The blue picks came to me as 4 medium and 18 heavy picks. The blue was really shiny and looked like blue cream. The medium picks had a sharp clear tone and the heavy has a strong warm tone. Good for the price it comes with.
2,FANTASY OR SCIENCE FICTION?,"There is a point where science fiction becomes fantasy, and Greg Egan passes that point with a vengeance. The mostly speculative physics is just that, speculation, fantasy run amok! The plot was poor, and character development was atrocious. I could feel no sympathy for, or identify with, any of the characters. The only good parts of the story were where mind transfers took place, this idea was well done here, but for an even better treatment of that read THE FIRST IMMORTAL by James Halperin, a very good novel."
3,Greg Egan gives his audience what they deserve,"At best we are just stolen moments of poorly designed software. That, at least, is the theme of this astonishingly dense book. Egan has spent the last decade showing us how the universe is not just a thing that lurks out there, but is a structure that we are directly responsible for. And now here is something different - we are a trick of the light, as is the underlying world, and both can be transformed to no effect. We will all have to choose whether to give up on this place or just move on. The bleakest novel I have yet read by an extraordinarily bleak novelist."
2,"Too difficult to comprehend, even for a physicist","I regret that I have to give this book a brief and poor review. I found it extremely hard to get into, struggled to keep interested in it and, finally, felt rather let down by a lackluster and unimpressive ending.Were it not for the glossary, buried near the end of the book, I would have found it totally incomprehensible and never pursued it to it's disappointing lack of finale.Unlike many of the hard SF books that I have greatly enjoyed, I was unimpressed with the attempts to link the plot to scientific theory. The characters were minimally developed and popped in and out of the story in a way that made following them most difficult.Oh well!"
2,"Great Science, Atrocious Fiction","Anything that makes a novel worth reading is entirely absent here. If you think Physical Review Letters is good light reading, than you might enjoy this book. The science is very well thought out indeed, but Egan should explore collaboration with an author that can write convincingly about how the science affects the individuals or the societies."
4,strong AI fantasyland,"Like to ponder the nature of the human mind? Don't find strong AI ridiculous? You'll then find this a complete rip--Earlier reviewers give a good scene-plot synopsis. I only add that the dance around logical impossibility is at the core of much good sci-fi. Egan provoked plenty of healthy examination of the nature of self and reason. He's not well grounded in general relativity which weakens the end, but this is still very high-quality sci-fi."
3,"Could have been great, but it peters out at the end.","Thought it might be another classic like Childhood's end, but the novel got lost in the middle and I was lost by the end."
3,Definitely For Hard-Science Buffs,"Egan goes into some really esoteric topics--high-energy physics, cosmology, non-euclidean geometries, etc. The science can be pretty thick to wade through, and will definitely give the less-literate reader headaches (and will probably give most science buffs trouble); e.g., there is a section set in a 5+1 universe--five physical dimensions plus time--and Egan tries to describe what a world composed of hypersurfaces would look like. The characters are generally talking heads used to explicate the science, meaning they're neither human enough to create drama nor as alien as virtually immortal AIs should be."
5,What a way to find an author,"This was the first book of his I read, and was blown away both by the technical details and the plot! The first 50 pages are the most incredible non-visual description of dynamic programming and creativity I've seen in a long while...Pity the friend I borrowed this from...his was brand new before I got it...(Yes, I replaced it for him)...and I lost my copy in a recent move...so I got this to add to my permanent collection. One of the few novels I would take with me if I were moving to a deserted island."
4,How far does your imagination go?,"I admit, most of Egan's physics and mathematics are way, WAY over my head (come on, how should I imagine n-dimensional cubes, singularities in the 6th dimension,... - no way, Jose!) and I was speed-reading whole 'lecture' passages in the book. But I enjoyed 'Diaspora' anyway because it's so inventive and unique, simply blows your mind away, and that's even after having read 'Permutation City' where some of the same ideas popped up, too. A lot of readers comment on the lack of characterisation, but then, we're not really talking about characters in this book are we? The whole cast is sentient software (ok some are based on fleshers (= humans)).I'm looking forward to another Egan!!"
3,"Less lecture, more story needed","At times, a difficult book to read since it is equal parts imaginative and mind-numbingly didactic. From the opening chapter where the creation of sentient software is described in exhaustive (and exhausting) detail to the long stretches in the novel where things are ""explained"" in such a way that that you feel you've wandered into a college lecture on theoretical physics, Egan is enamored a bit too much with his hard science concepts."
4,"I laughed, I cried . . . about computer software.","Watch yourself become emotionally attached to characters which are pure (sentient) software. Watch them be born, watch them learn, watch them be lonely.Egan's hyper-detailed fiction is startling in the degree in which it is grounded in real-world plausiblity. The exponential growth of the power of our current technology beckons his creation off the shelves of ""fiction""."
4,A good collection of American music,"Lukas Foss and the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra perform a number of well-known American music, such as Bernstein's Candide Overture and Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man. But it also includes some rarer pieces, like Cowell's Saturday Night at the Firehouse, and Ives' Circus Band March."
1,Not worth the Purchase,"The new CD intitled ""IZ"" was a terrific dissappointment.I anticipated hearing soft melodic music and vocals and neither were present on this CD. There is no vocal and the music is loud and abbrasive.A waste of money to purchase, unless you want something your vacuum can not drown out when you are working around the house."
1,IZ by IZ,"THIS IS REALLY BAD! WHEN YOU HEAR THE NAME "" IZ "" YOU WANT TO HEAR HIS BEAUTIFUL VOICE! NOT HARD ROCK. I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS CD. IF THIS WAS THEFIRST TIME LISTENING TO ""IZ"" I PROBABALY WOULD NOT BUY ANY OTHER CD BY HIM. THINKING THAT ALL HIS CD'S WERE LIKE THIS ONE. TAKE THIS CD OFF THE MARKET! LET THE PEOPLE NO HOW ""IZ"" REALLY SOUNDS! BARB SCHOOLEY"
3,Dr Zhivago a disaster-movie ?!?,"well, well there are not to many filmbooks about disastermovies. They certainly had there best time in the seventies with films like ""Airport"", ""Earthquake"" oder ""Towering Inferno"" but also the following decades brought us films like ""Volcano"" or ""Twister"". The books describes the genre starting in the 1910's, with detailed analyses of the 70's films. I miss a filmographie with detailed informations - instead you'll find a list of disastermovies including ""Batman"", ""Ben Hur"" or even ""Dr. Zhivago""... not very helpfull.... A few more pictures (5 on 133"
3,Problem with Cheese,"I like using this for everything except cheese. My cheese gets all ""gummed"" up on the star shaped holder and the underside of the blade."
4,"The 1972 ""Van Dyke Parks Album"" Returns At Last","Although it's not evident, this is a straight reissue of the 1972 Warner Bros. album produced by Van Dyke Parks and reportedly recorded in a single overheated evening during a hurricane, with much later fiddling by Mr. Parks. These are remakes of established Sparrow classics, but it's one of the all-time sublime remake albums, with the dense arrangements, horn sections, chorus singers and the rest of Parks's Beach-Boyish studio fantasy swirling gracefully around Sparrow's bravura vocals. A calypso record unlike any other. (For some reason, the track list is a mess and does not reflect the song sequence on the disc. But all 10 tunes are there.)"
5,Great,Great Sparrow Music. Bought for my mother for christmas who grew up with this mans music. She really enjoyed it
3,Not much wind blowing through my hair,"What sounds at first like it could be Lanterna's most effective work quickly subsides into all too familiar half-invested productions. For somebody so articulated in guitar tone, Frayne seldom does much more with his strumming finesse than plod along to the soundtrack of a predictable and unfulfilled travelogue."
3,Profanatica/ Masacre,"I assume this is the split that Colombian (South America) death metalers Masacre and one of USA's most satanic group ever Profanatica did . The sound on the album is not that good. The music seems to mush with the vocals and you cant hear a word or a single note from all the noise. Profanatica is basic black metal, very primitive, a drum that sounds like a pot and a whole lot of screaming and shrieking. Masacre, which is from a city in Colombia called Medellin was actually quite popular in South America in the early 90's and even Mayhem's Euronymous is said to have traded tapes and letters with Carlos ""Bull Metal "" Montoya who was one of the founding members of Masacre. The songs arent all that good, its just very heavy and loud death metal. If you are a collecter this will interest you, to the best of my knowldege Masacre disbanded some years back and Profanatica is one of those legendary cult bands that is sure to grab some of you metalheads attention. ..."
1,Probably not made by Pelican,"While the product does what one might expect - provide cushioning - this product appears to be very poorly made. After placing, removing and replacing the velcro dividers a few times, the wall sections of the set became loose and sagging. Additionally, there was no mention of Pelican on the instructions that came with the product, and it is black, not like the grey one pictured in the product listing.Hard to believe this came from a company that makes indestructible cases."
2,Are these really necessary?,I think I resent that a coffeemaker sold today does not offer a ready source for it's own filters. There should be a universal filter. These make my coffeemaker smell funny and I don't know that they do anything. Gimmick?Can't get them in stores and ordering online makes them twice the price. I will go unfiltered from now on...and am currently searching for a new coffeemaker. Seller was very good - shipped fast (shipping cost probably included some profit tho)
3,Not as good as Bebo live in concert,"I heard Bebo for the first time this week when I went to see him in concert with Third Day. I've never heard of him before but I was swept away by the music, his voice, the acoustic guitar, everything! He talked in between songs so I also got a chance to know the man behind the music. So I purchased the CD and quite honestly I have to admit I'm a little disappointed. Although the CD plays the same songs I heard at the concert, it just doesn't sound like the Bebo I first got to know. The songs seem a little watered down and doesn't sound like it's coming from the heart. I hope he comes out with a live music CD instead."
5,Lovely and lyrical,"WOW! DeCristofano writes science in such a fresh and lyrical voice - not only did I understand the theory of the Big Bang, but I ENJOYED reading about it. At last, a science book that kids can understand and love reading again and again. Her writing is like poetry."
5,daughter loved it!,"My 5 year old daughter devoured this book and for several days afterwards talked about the expanding universe, how it was just a bit bigger today than yesterday. She also mused about how it could all become a tiny speck again ... it certainly captured her imagination and I am sure as she re-reads it later it will awaken further curiosity and prompt observation. This is a marvelous book for all ages and I can't wait to read it again myself. You don't have to have a child to love this book."
2,cheapie version,This version and all NY times Crossword Books published byST MARTIN'S GRIFFIN are poorly done copies of books earlier done by RANDOM HOUSE. These books are cheaper but the quality is much poorer. The Type face is not as bold and paper quality is poor (pages tear easily with erasures). Also the title of each puzzle is lacking making solving extremely difficult where duoble letter squares are used or the spelling of answers is related to the title clue.
3,NY Times Sunday Crosswords Edited by Will Shortz,"I have been enjoying NY Times Sunday Crosswords for years edited by others. But these, edited by Will Shortz, I find loaded with rarely if never used words. I have had two years of college, one at U of C at Berkeley, majoring in English and Literature. I love the English language as well as other languages and how they relate to each other.These puzzles are not fun because the words are not fair."
4,Very nice watch,Tag Formula 1F1 is a very nice watch with a great price from Amazon.com.The only critique is the watch face design / coloring sometimes makes it difficult to see the time with a quick glance. The hour and minute hands blend in with the stopwatch minute an 1/10 sec hands.
5,Very happy.,"I had my eye on this watch for quite a while. In fact, I was looking at several and had a hard time deciding between this same one with the white face and another model that includes a digital readout. I already have a Swiss Army Officer's Ratchet Bezel with black face so thought I should get a different color face. I ordered the white face, got it and just wasn't happy with it - too bright. Sent that back, ordered the black face and love it - the three chrono dials add a bit of color and interest to the black face. Very sporty, but classic enough to look good at work. It is now my go-to watch for every day."
4,Soothes scratchy throats,"These work really well to remove that ""wool coat"" feeling in the throat when you have a cold, or are fighting one. The red currant flavor is bright and tangy compared to the black currant pastilles, but neither is overwhelmingly strong."
2,Waxy and tough,"I'd read the ratings on this product, and expected it to be delicious. It was instead, waxy and tough. I won't buy it again."
2,Nothing to see,"If you want to see some photos of the author's place so as to get an idea of what he is talking about, don't look in here. There are no pictures in this book which makes it mostly useless."
5,The original lasted 12 years.,"This is an exact replacement for original equipment, which served 12 years. It is important to catch drippings and gets real grungy until it starts blocking airflow. Original can be cleaned, but only so many times before mesh disconnects."
4,better than expected. not a five star 'cos size was slightly off.,better than expected. did not give a five start 'cos size was slightly off. my husband was able to cut it down to the size we needed and the beauty of this product is the bands around the outside go back on once it was re-sized. i would buy again 'cos it is a quality filter and these babies are hard to find.
3,Packaging a problem,"I was happy to find filters that fit my down draft Jennair range. The product is fine, the price is fine BUT the packaging was flimsy and resulted in the filters having many small bends in the frame. Given that I need to keep mice from getting across the filter and into my house, I was quite disappointed. I needed to work hard to get the edges straight again."
5,Rosie V,"When I first heard this years ago, the music brought to mind Steely Dan. A check of the credits found Gary Katz as producer and the listed musicians included Walter Becker, Donald Fagen, Rick Derringer, Jim Keltner, Michael Been & Tony Levin. That roster alone warrants a listen. Dan fans will probably like this."
5,sublime,"Whaw, what a fantastic record. One of the best of all times, no doubt about it. A shame she never had the chance to become one of the leading singers in the world.But thank you for this one, Rosie."
2,Dreadful,how can an album with such great musical talent end up sounding like this schlock ?no wonder this so called singer was never heard from again.
4,resplendent!,"rosie's delicate vocals float effortlessly over pop/folk/country meets jazz fusion for an original production in 1997. fans of carly simon, joni mitchell and alana davis would fall in love with this hard to find gem.but, where is she now?"
4,I Really Liked It! Very Entertaining!,I highly recommend this one if you're a fan of lady sleuths. Parts of it are hilarious!
2,Mindless Entertainment,"Shallow, simplistic; the raunchiness gets desperately extreme in attempt to entertain. Does so partially, but with the reader's reluctance. Pathetic characters not many can relate to; most of those who could have already commited suicide. (Pardon my cynical humor there).I read Hayter's first book in the Robin Hudson series, ""What's a Girl Gotta Do?"" and after laughing out loud every two pages, promptly checked out this one. I don't know if I was uncharastically critical that afternoon or what, but reading it was more or less a rerun of Hayter's first novel. For many of you that will mean ""Yeah! More!"", but for me the raunchiness and sarcastic humor gets old, repetative, and annoyingly shallow after the first dose. Overall, not worth your time to read. Or, get it and love it, but it belongs not on your book shelf but in with the pile of gossip glamour magazines and chocolate bars. This book falls into that category of entertainment: probably not worth your money."
4,A Fun Book,"I received this book in a book exchange and it looked like it would be fun to read. It was. I enjoyed Robin Hudson, her friends, even her aunt. This book had me smiling and laughing at times.This is a very enjoyable book.I plan to read more of the books in this series."
5,Funny female sleuth,"If you don't like funny mysteries with female protagonists you won't enjoy this one. I do (like) and did (enjoy). It's set in Manhattan with the narrator working in TV. She's something of a Bridget Jones character. Maybe there's symbolism in the S and M stuff, with the heroine having problems at work about being assertive or passive in a male-dominated world but mostly it's just funny with an ingenious and suspensful plot. Not quite as good as Janet Evanovich but almost there."
4,Still Going Strong,"Monty Q's contribution to the John Blair series is a fine one indeed. The Vasquez remix of Catapila's ""Void"" starts it with a bang. It moves fluidly from hard house to lighter trance and back again, without losing energy. The middle chunk of the CD -- ""Set Me Free,"" ""Share My Joy,"" and ""Sound of Bamboo"" -- is the most rewarding."
3,Laced With Romance trots along,"'Laced With Romance' basically combines Robert Smith wails with music that falls somewhere in between Britpop jangle and Televisions 'Marquee Moon', Johnny Marr meets Tom Verlaine. After awhile the vocals seem a bit rough, yet at the sametime, they do capture the spirit of post-punk defiance. Angular guitars, sparkling melodies, with rabble-rousing vocals."
1,Pony poo?,"If I hear this garbage one more time I'm gonna do something I'll regret. Take the most annoying bands from the 70s and roll them into a loud, stinky ball and you've got the Ponys. The most grating thing about this band is its singer who sounds like he is being strangled while someone is shoving peanut butter in his annoying gob. Pass. Pass. In fact RUN!"
5,rock.,"this is one of the best rock records out there today. if you are a fan of dirty, poppy, snotty, loud, melodic rock music this is the joint for you! please buy this today. i got it 2 days ago and have not stopped listening to it."
1,Bad Listing,I ordered this. It came with just the PLASTIC. Nothing else.Overtons said you just get the shell even tho Amazon says you get everything but pedastal. I feel ROBBED! Returned.
2,Sorry I bought Dummies,"the book is filled with very simple basic information. I have attempted to look up a couple of items in order to file or have windows handle a problem (e.g. load a set of fonts so that I can use them in word and the book does nottell me how to do it. In EX it was simple... just go to fonts and click on ""add fonts"". It may be good for the first time computer user but for an upgrader itis useless."
3,Office 2007 for dummies,"This book was too simple for me.Although I did learn many tricks, etc., I was looking for a more detailed use of Access querries and did not find them here.Good for the beginner, but falls short for the mid to advanced student."
2,Not for Outlook,"I needed this for information on Outlook and thought it would be better to have information on all of office. What I got was a total of 50 pages (1/8 of the book) on Outlook and it was almost exclusively HOW TO SEND AND RECIEVE EMAIL !?!?!?!? I may be computer illiterate, but who doesn't know how to send and recieve emails?This book is only for someone who has never owned or operated a computer at all. Completely worthless as far as I am concerned."
3,Office 2007 For Dummies,"I was looking for the differences from Office 2003 in this book and was disappointed. Maybe the differences are few, but somehow I cannot believe that. It appeared to me to be written for someone that was just starting out and had no prior experience, real Dummies I guess."
5,Office for Dummies,The book does exactly what it says it does. I understand the program better and have been practicing and have been able to pass assessment testing with this product.Thank you
1,Book is as it says just for dummies!!,"I was looking for help in just one special area. Envelopes!! I just wanted to learn how to create reusable templets for envelopes so I could just pull one up and use it to prind a quick and easy envelope.Do you think the book helped me.....NO...............Does anyone out there know the answer to my mystery?Semper Fi,Bill"
2,Office 2007 for Dummies,"I was disappointed in this book. I felt the information was poorly organized and the instructions were not basic enough for a ""dummy."""
3,Microsoft Office 2007 for Dummies,"If you have past computer knowlege, this is a waste of money. If this software is new to you, it would be helpful"
1,no help for developing search engine info on web pages. In fact book is no help at all.,"this book is of no help at all. There is no info for addressing use in web site development, no info on search engine info. The table of content and index only appear to provide adequate info. If I hadn't marked in the book I would return it. Not worth the price."
4,great help,"This book is excellent for those who,like myeslf, missed the class on intuitive GUI.s It is excellent for figuring out where Microsoft hid all our favorite things."
3,Good presentation of sightings and evidence in New York State,"Monsters of the Northwoods is a comprehensive examination of activity in New York State and portions of Vermont. The main focus is Whitehall, NY, where the author(s) are from. The book does of great job of presenting reports and evidence. It includes a photo section with illustrations based on witness descriptions and photos of footprint finds.Aside from a short jaunt into UFO territory, where the authors propose a connection between UFOs and Bigfoot based on coincidental sightings, the book is a good reference and documentation of Bigfoot sightings and accounts. The book also offers an examination of Native American legend about large hominids in the New York area.In all the book documents over 140 cases, extending from the Watertown area to Long Island, and areas of western Vermont. Monsters of the Northwoods makes a solid case supporting the possible existence of the creatures known as Bigfoot."
2,Poorly written,"This book is poorly written and extremely hard to follow. She takes a subject, which could have been extremely interesting, and just completely muddles it up. I'm not sure if the book is an investigative report or a memoir. Either way it fails. There are no maps of Marion or Indiana included in the book, the characters come in and out of the book in a confusing manner, and after trudging my way through 3/4 of the book I'm still not sure as to what the author's point is. It would have been infinitely more interesting if she would have committed to researching her family's history and relating it to the lynching in 1930."
5,Our Town by Cynthia Carr,"If you want to read truth that in many ways is a metaphor for what was happening across America over the last four decades, read this amazingly accurate account of Marion, Indiana, and its KKK, and the residue that still exists today there as well as in many other geographical locations in the minds and hearts of some Americans.The reason why I know that her book is amazingly accurate is that I lived there and worked with many of these people Carr reports about. I not only taught at the two school systems and worked as a reporter at the Marion-Chronicle (a player in this drama)at the time, I was there standing outside my classroom the day the cafeteria erupted into a civil rights melee!Although this book offers many threads of story, Carr's real contribution is the accurate documentation of a slice of history that shows the danger of ""willful neglect"" of us all as we watch innocent citizens abused and killed in the name of God.---Charlene Lutes, Ph.D."
5,Excellent book for all who are challenged by choices!,"This book is not only about family, faith and illness. But also about how vulnerable we are to accepting and not questioning, and to fear and not love. A must read book for anyone that is questioning alternatives and for those that think they shouldn't."
4,A Great Watch!,Had the prior model of this watch made by TAG and was the most reliable watch I ever owned.I was talked into moving to a Rolex and hated it and then to a Michele - hated those too and could not get back to TAG fast enough.They did move away from the rolex type bracelet on this model- which I hate to see but the band is still substantial.These watches are absolute work horses and if you keep it cleaned and tuned will last a lifetime.
1,The watch stopped working!!!,"I was afraid of making such acquisition thru the web, I took my chances and now i regret that the watch stopped working a couple of months after i got it. Since Amazon retains the guarantee card, there was no retailer willing to help me.If you want to buy this type of watches you'd better do it at macys or any retailer that has product support."
3,Not needed,"The door came with foam. There's really no need to get this kit as well. The silicone cock was nice to seal around the outside of the door, but you can get this on its own for just a couple of bucks."
1,DO NOT NEED,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT NECESSARY JUST AN ADD ON. BUY YOUR OWN SILICONE AND OR FOAM STRIP FOR ADDED INSULATION. DOOR DOES COMES WITH FOAM WEATHERSTRIPPING.
4,Not really needed,"The product seemed good and I am keeping it just in case some other project may arise. But for installing my doggy door, I just did not need to use it"
4,Excellent learning DVD,"Great DVD for learning new tricks and making hoop dance exhilerating. I enjoyed the combos at the end of the selections to see how the tricks can flow together. The slow motion and multiple camera angles were perfect for learning the moves. I've never used a DVD for reference like this one. My workouts are no longer ""workouts"". Your DVD got me fianlly dancing and feeling good about it :)"
2,not much here,"I did read the reviews before I bought this, but like an idiot I still bought it anyway. This is a DVD on how to do tricks with your hoop. Nothing more. No exercises, no substance, just a cutesy name for each trick, some yogi-sounding mumbo-jumbo (breathe into your hoop...) and the briefest of explanations for how to actually do these tricks. I've watched it once. Anyone wanting a slightly used copy for cheap, please contact me, I will never watch this again.This is NOT an EXERCISE VIDEO. Please stop it from being tagged as such."
3,"Shows a lot of moves, but niggly issues","I'm usually not a reviewer, but felt I had to submit a review on this DVD. While it shows a lot of moves, I was really put off by the clothes and the music (which I found extremely jarring/repetitive and too much of a mix of new world/dance.) Yes I know, it's all personal taste... I just couldn't get motivated to watch the performance pieces cause of that annoying music! I saw a Youtube of Christabel on R&K and that music was fantastic! Will this DVD teach you how to hoop and some tricks? Yes and no. There are aspects where she spends some time explaining the move, but I'm more of a technical person... ""imagining myself moving around like a cobra"" makes me go ""Hrrmm ok, a cobra moves like this"" I'd RATHER have ""the hoop should be touching these points, and this is when you should be pushing/pulling."" Again personal preference, but for those out there like me, I'd recommend turning the music down, and supplementing this dvd with other things."
3,Not bad,"This DVD is okay. I did learn a lot from it. But after viewing Hoopnotica, I think it was the lesser of the two. Some of the tricks are hard to follow because they don't mention which directiong the hoop is going and they leave some basic details out."
3,Very good but not appropriate for teaching elementary kids,I had watched her perform on GMA and was very impressed with her and looked up her DVD. I looked her up and emailed her about producing a DVD for children so I could use it to learn to teach in my P.E. classes. She recommended this one. I learned some of the moves and was able to teach my students but because of the outfits did not feel comfortable using it as a resouce to show my students. I have a prosthesis in my leg leg which limits my activity so I cannot do all the skills and would have liked to use it in my classes because many of the students could perform them. She is very talented and it has an excellent breakdown of the skills and could be a valuable addition to a teachers curriculum... if it was age appropriate in its presentation(the outfits and clothing in the dvd). If the clothing were different it would be five stars.
5,I really LOVE this DVD,"The clarity of the instructions for each move (including really helpful slow motion close-ups to amplify the important details), together with vivid imagery, offer real encouragement and make it all seem achievable.This DVD offers so many moves to learn and the inclusion of choreographed combinations of moves is a real bonus. Anyone starting out with hooping can begin to see how to combine moves and transitions and really dance with their hoop. Great value, beautiful women, lush scenery - wonderful stuff!"
4,Pretty Good,"Not a bad instructional hooping video. I am a beginner, and have already been using Hoopnotica's instructional dvds. HoopGirl is adequate, though the instruction is not as detailed as Hoopnotica's. I love the costumes, and the fact that HoopGirl eventually combines several of the moves together into different combinations. Overall, it's a good addition to my library as it does explain the basics of how to do many different hoop moves."
1,Such huge potential,"I love everything about Hulaerobics which is why I went ahead with purchasing this one. I was quickly disappointed. This dvd is not made with beginners in mind. It is very frustrating. Christabel, the pro that she is, flows through each move so seamlessly that it is impossible to make it out enough for you to copy. It does not help matters that she combines her fluidity with speed and rushes through the dvd. My dvd is now here collecting dust. Every time I try to use it, I am quickly reminded why I have not used it in so long. I think I am going to sell it. Hit me up if interested :)."
4,(RAW Rating: 3.5) - For what it's worth,"A book of inspirational quips and short poetry, POCKET CHANGE FOR LIFE exudes a melodic, but strong voice of someone wise and seasoned in the ups and downs of life. The piece covered seemingly every topic imaginable such as love, parenting, self-worth, and spiritualism. A few of my favorites included ""Do Your Part And Be Not Dismayed,"" ""An Adult Is Nothing More Than A Licensed Kid,"" and ""Truth Is A Healer.""My only complaint with this book is that is was just too short. It seemed as though I could have read at least 3 times as many pages of these pieces. A short, sweet book of advice on dealing with life's little twists, POCKET CHANGE FOR LIFE by Akila Mukarramma made me smile at its cleverness, nod my head in agreement with its wisdom, and inhale its words in no time at all.Reviewed by CandaceKof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
5,Completely sums up what I feel and felt when I was that age.,"Ever After was absolutely captivating. I loved it. I could and can relate to everything that was described in the book. It was so on key to what a young teenage girl feels about her friends, family, boys and her all-around life. It was a great book and I would love to have a truthful and loving friend like Grace."
2,Not something I'd like my 12 year-old to read!,"My 12 year-old asked for this book for Christmas. I like to check out the books she wants to read before getting them for her, as so many books that are aimed at kids these days are DEFINITELY not sending messages that I want my daughter absorbing. By the reviews, it sounds like a great book, but when I got into reading it, I found a lot of negativity. Teens and preteens do have a big struggle on their hands, and though this may be ""reinforcement"" for some older teens, I feel that it lays out a course that I don't want my girl on. It totally dispels any notion of enchantment, which is one of the great things about childhood, right on the first pages. Kids are growing up way too fast- this book will certainly help speed it up. How sad."
5,great computer,this was a great buy. I got my money's worth.I would defenitely recomend this computer to everyone

2,you aren't missing anything...,"I am an avid reader of science fiction and paranormal romance and took a chance on this e-book.I didn't mind the format, (CD-ROM), but I didn't really care for the author's writing style. I found that the plot wasn't developed well enough to support the author's acceleration - too many things were happening in too short of a time frame.All-in-all, it was a dissatisfying read."
3,it's ok...but,"i had had my watch less than 2 weeks when the leather strap came out of its connection to the watch...from the beginning, after seeing its construction, i had no faith in the leather-to-metal connection so i was careful not to put a lot of strain on the strap...no matter--it fell off anyway...the watch itself is very nice and keeps good time...i would recommend its purchase, but only if you buy a 3rd-party chain on which to wear it..."
1,Wenger watches - absolute JUNK!!!!!!,"I purchased one of these watches then got another identical watch as a gift. Let me say that these watches are ABSOLUTE JUNK and that Wenger's customer service is abysmal. One of the watches stopped working within two weeks of me taking it out of the box. Wenger did replace the movement but I still had to pay $10 plus the cost of shipping the watch to them, which made me quite upset given the short time that the watch was functional. The other watch quit working within a year and when I sent it back Wenger wanted $60 to replace the movement. They also charged me the initial $10 just to look at the watch to tell me that.I would never purchase another Wenger product of any kind and I do not recommend their products at all after this experience."
2,The alarm is useless..,"I only use pocket watches and have a number of them, but I wanted one with an alarm. I liked the look of the Wenger, clean and simple. I was disappointed when I received it, it was bigger than I thought; some of my watch pockets are a bit small and this one would certainly get stuck. Big disappointment was the alarm, it's virtually inaudible. I thought the watch might be defective, so I called Wenger. I was told the the alarm is not loud at best. What's the point?! It's supposed to be an ALARM! I returned it for a refund."
3,Mustaine - Still the Architect of Agression,"Although this album is definitely no Rust in Peace, it still has a lot of the thrash Megadeth embedded in it. The killer riffs are still there, plus Mustaine's ""in-your-face"" sneer is at its peak form. Hate and aggression has somewhat been diminished, especially on ballads like ""Promises"" and the forgetable ""Losing My Senses""(the reason I am giving it only 3 stars). However, the fast and furious solos and riffs on ""Dread and the Fugitive Mind"", ""Moto Psycho"" coupled with Mustaines's infectios and society-angst, love-lost-pain lyrics more than make up for that. The title track itself is highly listenable and will surely bring Megadeth new fans. ""Return to Hangar"", while very similar to the original ""Hangar 18"", still manages to introduce excitement and adrenaline, making it a powerful song on its own. No doubt, Mustaine is still the Architect of Agression."
1,What a piece of Megacrap,"Does anyone remember when this band used to be good? I didn't think it could be worse than Risk but I was wrong. They had a ballad with strings. I cried. People who enjoy this album also bought, N'Sync, Backstreet Boys and Paul Anka. Need I say don't waste your money?"
2,Megadeth's worst album,"This album had the worst lineup in the history of Megadeth.Songwriting hit bottom.No really outstanding riffs.Solos lacked taste.It was an effort that was focused on putting in more palm muted notes, more notes in solos, more bass drumming, and the result was really contrived.The lyrics are the worst by Mustaine. It doesn't help that he speaks out a lot of them as well. ""I've got a recipe for hate... taste it!!!"" Cringeworthy.Not a return to form, that came after with 'The system has failed.'Relative favorites: 1000X Goodbye (which suffered from additional editing after the original album entitled 'Capitol punishment' was leaked), 'Dread and the fugitive mind,' and 'Burning bridges.'Lyrically, the best is probably 'When' (only after the pathetic spoken word)."
2,Don't believe the hype,"The only reason I can't give this one star is because there is obviously good musicianship on display. However, there is a thing called songwriting that is more important and it done poorly on this recording. There is also something called passion, which might be most important of all and, again, nowhere to be found. The songs on display here are complete and utter garbage. Dave's voice has lost its edge, the lyrics have deteriorated into senseless drivel spurred on by a touching thanks to God in the credits. Any attempt at anger and agression comes off as pandering to an audience which Megadeth seem to no longer have anything in common with. I have finally learned my lesson after buying the last three Megadeth releases: Megadeth's days are numbered and I could care less."
2,A big miss,"I picked up the album under the hype that Megadeth was returning to it former harder edged self. Boy was I duped. This album doesn't cut it. Moto-Psycho being the only redeeming track on the album. Word to the wise, stick with ""Peace Sells,"" ""Rust In Peace"" and ""Countdown to Extinction"" This album is very weak."
3,Not what I expected,"For all you people that heard Megadeth was returning to their old metal days...your wrong. World Needs a Hero is almost metal but I classify it as hard rock. The problem is that the songs lack structure and the lyrics, well...arn't that great. The songs lack a cool, catchy chorus. Like when you listen to ""Symphony of Distruction"" your waiting to hear the ""just like the pied piper led rats through the streets"" part; its just not there. I'm no boy band lover but who doesn't like music to be alittle catchy? I'd have to say 1000 Times Goodbye is the highlight of the album."
5,THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF HEAVY METAL ARE BACK!!,"Well, upon getting this album today, when it came out, i was amazed. If there are any fans of the days of metal when it wasnt techno-covered or with rap/hip-hop vocals, this is the album to buy. the closest thing i can relate this to is the old megadeth, and metallica. i seriously recomend that you buy this album, it is a great mix of thrash metal (moto psycho) and slower, but still heavy songs. anyways, get this album, you will be happy you did!"
2,If tis album was released twenty years ago...,"I would have liked it a lot better. But as it stands, this album just sounds too lost in a time warp for my liking. This style of thrash metal just seems more like something out of the early eighties than the year 2001. At least in the early eighties it would have had some *true* nostalgia. As it is, it seems Mustaine just wanted to live in the past with this album rather than getting a little more ""with the program."" If you want a TRUELY nostalgic Megadeth album, listen to Peace Sells, or Killing Is My Business (preferably Peace). Or if you feel like traveling to the early nineties, listen to Rust in Peace, Countdown To Extinction, or Youthanasia (all three are excellent). But avoid this album unless you can actually convince yourself you're listening to something from the ""good 'ole days.""So much for the ressurection of thrash metal."
5,Megadeth is back and better than ever.,"Megadeth's ""The World Needs a Hero"" is a complete masterpiece. Dave Mustaine continues to become a better singer and songwriter with each album. If you have enjoyed any previous Megadeth music, then you will love this new album. Every song has been wonderfully written and begs you to hit that replay button over and over. Once you put this disk into your player, it will stay there for a very long time. If you decide to buy this album, it will be the best [money] you spent all year."
2,I really wanted to like this album.,"This is easily the heaviest and most 'metal' album Megadeth has made in a long time, definatly much more so than their previous album Risk. After Marty Friedman left, Dave Mustaine apparently felt the need to return to metal, and he succeded in that. Unfortunately, the music suffered as a result. Instead of making a good rock album, he made a very medicore metal album. ""Return To Hanger"" is not even nearly as interesting as the classic ""Hanger 18"", ""Dread and the Fugitive Mind"" sounds basically like ""Sweating Bullets"" and ""1000 Times Goodbye"" sounds very forced and insincere. For the most part, I think this album sounds very half-baked; it just sounds to me like Dave was far more interested in making a metal album than a good album. I think it's really a shame that a great band like Megadeth had to end their career with a stinker like this."
2,Mega'deth' is right!,"Now, I'm not the type of jaded fan who wants them to go back to playing a million miles a second, in fact I don't like the REAL old material. I came aboard on ""Countdown (*****)"" and was hooked on the passionate/descriptive lyrics. I don't find that here on the new cd, instead what I found is a lot of riffs I've heard elsewhere/before. I found the last cd RISK (***) to be more uneven than this one but overall it had better tracks. The production here is actually very good but because Mustaine was the ""producer"" I think he let a lot of songs slip in here that may sound nice but really offer little in substance. Time to dust off that copy of Countdown and realize there is no going home, until next time hopefully."
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE WISE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm shocked that so many think this is a great return to old form. i challenge people to play Rust In Peace and then play this and honestly say it is as good. It doesn't have the vision, the creativity and the talent evident in Rust in Peace or any other Megadeth album I have. The press all said this was fantastic - they must be getting paid and they are probably writing online reviews under different names. I know alot of people who have been into Metal for 15 years or more and none of them like this album either. Save your cash because this is just more rubbish."
2,"Megadeth is dead, face it!","Obviously, Risk was horrible, and this album means nothing but a desperate desire to recover the glory of Rust in Peace.It's a very good album considering Risk, of course. By itself, this title only deserves like a couple of listening sessions, and in mp3 format. Don't waste your money... unless you want to complete your Megadeth collection before moving to another band.The songs on this one are so boring... so, so boring. The only peak is Return To Hangar."
3,declining,"Megadeth seems to go downhill with each album. The songs on here just arent very good. Id rather see them buy songs, the way pop artists do, than to keep tolerating bad music. I know some would disagree but Im tired of wasting money on CDs with bad songs. While this may not be the worst pile of crap, its not the best. Theres not much songwriting talent here. Give me Rust in Peace or Countdown!"
2,COpy,"Unforgiveable copy of ""AM I EVIL"" in the track WHEN ruins the whole CD!! How can Mustaine do that?? If at least he wrote something about it in the CD credits, like if he way paying a tribute to Diamond HEad or something like that...What a shame, man!!"
2,The world sort of really doesn't bother about needing a hero,"yeah. Some great riffs. And i love the drum syncopation of the title track. the title track is worth buying the album for. All the other songs I'm afraid are typical of megadeth: Cool riff - but they do nothing with it. they should take a lesson from the Deep Purple/Black sabbath school, and learn how to use a rif properly. Just playing it over and over to begin with, then wandering off into the same dribbly bits and nasal vocals don't get you anywhere. This is a great album if you only listen to the first 10 seconds of ever song."
2,what happened to the Megadeth I know?,"What a pity. The worst Megadeth album I've listened to. Usually, Mustaine's lyrics are great, but this one sounds like the music and lyrics were written by a 5 year old. I even liked Risk, and I fail to see why that was such a flop. If there was one song that was atleast partially redeeming that I can pretend that I didn't totally waste my money on, it was 'Disconnect'. Hopefully, the next album will go back to the formulae of the albums of the mid 90s."
4,Megadeth is back.,"Every track on this one rocks. Great performances. Great songs. New guitarist Al Pitrelli fills super shredder Marty Friedman's shoes nicely. Highlight's include; 1000 Times Goodbye, Disconnect, Recipe for Hate...Warhorse, and Promises. The only thing that prevents it from getting a five star rating is that the overall production seems a bit parred down and it doesn't have the same overall sound like albums Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia. I wish producer Max Norman was on board for this one. If you like hard rock, metal or guitar shredding you should check this one out."
2,Where Have You Gone MegadetH?!,"Alright, I'm a MegadetH fan and I will say that this record is par for Dave, but still there is some really bad things about this album. First: The solos are all at the end of the songs and are always far to long. You end up getting 2 minutes of actual song and 3 to 4 minutes of solos. The solos are great as they should be for the guitar genius Dave Mustain, but they are far to long to hold your interest! The title track is okay and so is the first one, but the best of the album is right at the center. The last few songs are par with the exception of one. Second: Megadeth tries to shoot for a few ballad like songs on this album. They are unfortunately, just not that good. The string arrangements are sloppy and don't go well with the guitars. Sorry guys, but this one is just kinda poor.:("
5,Megadeths best album,"I am a huge Deth fan. I really was disappointed with Risk. Now after Hero was released a feew years ago I stil listen to it and it grows on me. I really think that this is their best work, yes even better tahn RIP or Countdown. It is very varied, angry, yet atchy and happy. Maybe this is not the best album to get to know Deth, but it rocks once you know where the guys are coming from."
5,Megadeths [message] to those wh doubted.,WOW..Is the only word I can say right now. ..............................................................................................................................OK I thought of somemore.This album is AWESOME.Its like they put Rust In Piece and Countdown to Extinction in one album.
5,Absolutely brilliant!,"There's not a single bad track on here. THIS is the Megadeth cd I was hoping they'd make. For those looking for the fast and furious, there's ""Moto Psycho"", ""Dread and the Fugitive Mind"", ""Recipe for Hate...Warhorse"", and the incredible sequel of sorts ""Return To Hangar"". For those looking for more melodic metal with chugging crunching riffs, it's all here. Each song is a masterpiece in and of itself. From Dave's almost screaming lyrics on ""Burning Bridges"" to the almost insanity inspired ""When"". It's all here and it all ROCKS! Once again Megadeth proves they are the most talented metal band around. Period."
5,Megadeth does it again...,"Though some may believe the Megaboys sold-out with their previous ""Risk"", they have come back in a very metal way. Return to Hangar rips like mad with some very powerful riffs. Promises is on the softer side, with a beautiful string backing. The album is just amazing. I highly recommend it."
2,Mediocre,"This album was hailed as a return to form after the disaster that was Risk, and it partially succeeds. There are some heavy cuts here, and nothing blatantly commercial or made for radio. But the songs don't hold up to those on any of the albums up through Cryptic Writings. My favorites are When, Dread and Fugitive Mind, and Burning Bridges, but I wouldn't include any of these songs in a list of Megadeth's top 20 tracks. There are no classics, no unforgettable hooks or riffs. This album is for Megadeth completists only (that's the only reason I own it). Anybody else should start with Peace Sells, Rust in Peace, or Countdown to Extinction."
2,Not what we were told to expect...,"I've listened through the album a few times and I'll have to admit I'm not very impressed. I have been a Megadeth fan since their inception and up until ""Risk"", loved every album. All of the hype about this album was how they were going back to their roots and that the album would be a lot heavier than their last few. Where's the beef??? It has a very commercial feel similar to the last 2 albums and I really feel it falls short. 'Return to Hangar' gets heavy and has some great guitar parts but it doesn't compare to 'Hangar 18'. 'When' is a pitiful song reminiscent of the crap on ""Risk"". I am ever so sorry to report that the world needs a hero ... I am very disappointed."
2,Attempt to go back to roots just goes backward,"Megadeth's previous album gave listeners a more mello, radio-friendly Megadeth. However, Risk was largely rejected by Megadeth loyalists and almost completely rejected by mass media.So, in ""The World Needs a Hero""(TWNaH herein) they look like they want to say, ""Forget the radio! We're just going to rock."" The problem is that they don't rock.There is a general blandness to this album. TWNaH is composed of mostly uninteresting riffs. They seem rushed. The riffs are mid-tempo and are thin. This album sounds like a slow version of their ""Rust in Peace"" album.In summary, Megadeth appears to try to ""go back to their roots"", but they didn't want to abandon pop culture. The end result is a mock-""heavy metal"" album. Once they were leaders in the metal community, now they are just one of a thousand bands releasing dull sing-along."
2,Not the best from Megadeth.,"I've become a huge fan of Megadeth over the past few years, but this isn't one of the better products."
2,NOT ONE OF THE BEST FROM MEGADETH!!!!,"WORLD NEEDS A HERO is not one of the best from the legendary THRASH METAL band MEGADETH......well, this one is way better than the previous one risk(what a horrible album!!!!), but the band don[t record inspired songs here.....some tunes are good like disconnect and the title track, but compared to other megadeth albuns like the classic KILLING IS MY BUSINESS, and the masterpieces RUST IN PEACE and PEACE SELLS, world needs a hero SUCKS!!!!! try the next one SYSTEM HAS FAILED, ENDGAME and 13, but leave world needs for the last with risk......only if you are a MEGA fanatic and wants ALL MEGA stuff......."
2,LAST BREATH,"The trouble with this CD is not that the songs are not good; it's not the ovrewhelming sense of deja-vu. No. The songs are good and the ""deja-vu"" is nothing more than a great band playing his own defined style.The trouble here is that the production made the band sound tired, uninspired and without energy here, mainly the weak drumming by Jimmy DeGrasso. Never before, in a Megadeth record, the drums sounded so weak and without imagination. MUsaine's vocals are also in a down slope, and Pitrelli's playing is unmemorable, altough of course the guy is a guitar-genius.It seems to me that Dave already knew this was the last MEgadeth album for a long while, and that he did not put his heart on it.Anyway, this album is miles, miles, and more miles ahead of the abominable RISK. So, if you're a Megadeth fan like myself, ThE World... will not dissapoint you. It will only leave you asking: where's the punch here?"
3,"Torn opinion - two awesome songs, but the rest are so-so","I love Megadeth, but was disappointed overall. Dread & the Fujitive Mind (on this album) instantly became one of my favorite songs of all time...I feel I spent my money well because of this song and REturn to Hangar 18. The others were only lukewarm to me (especially MotoPsycho...too repetitive for my taste). Most fans will like this one, but be warned that all the songs won't blow your socks off as promised."
2,I DON'T LIKE IT. IT'S NOT METAL ANYMORE!!,"Look, Megadeth used to be my favorite band, but This album is not heavy metal! Please, don't rate it with your heart, rate it with your mind and ears! This is not a good production. I loved ""Rust in Peace"" and ""peace sells""... but this is not a good album!"
1,They Dont Make em like they use to,What else can I say...This record was supposed to mark a return to the Rust in PEACE days...Instead they give us a PEACE of crap.It is now offical...Megadeath is done.
4,Who gives a F***!,"I'm quite a new Megadeth listener beginning my taste with Rust In Peace. I bought this album and at first regretted it. Once i had listened to it a couple of times, i began liking each song one by one. once i got one of them stuck in my head, i was hooked. This album rocks! for any music lover with a fond taste for kick ass heavy metal. metal is all about not giving a F*** and thats how it should be. so all inhibitions should be forgotten, and just enjoy it! who cares about meaning and all that S***. if you do, your taking music TOO seriously, and metal is not about that."
3,Not a return to form,"After Mustaine released Risk and experienced a big backlash from Megadeth fans, he proclaimed a return to form with ""The World Needs a Hero"". This is more or less a calculated attempt at trying to recapture the glory days while still being heavily rooted in the more pop style he has adopted. All is not lost here however, ""Dread and the Fugitive Mind"" has become one of my favorite Deth tunes. ""Promises"" is a heavily underrated ballad. ""Burning Bridges"" and ""1000 Times Goodbye"" also are personal highlights from the album. Most of whats left fails to capture my attention, and this one should only be purchased by Megadeth fans. It just barely is worthy of the three stars bestowed upon it."
4,Back to their more popular roots!,"This is an album that only Megadeth could make in this day in time in their career,oldschool thrash and fist pumping metal!5 great songs on this album make it an instant classic and they are:Disconnect,Moto Psycho,Promises,Dread and the Fugitive Mind,and Return to Hangar.The new guitarist Al Pitrelli is pretty good,but he is no Marty Friedman.He does sound more like Marty than Poland or Young ever did.A great comeback album from a more mediocre Risk in 1999."
4,Megadeth has given the fans what they wan't,"Megadeth is back in all their heavy metal glory. ""The World Needs a Hero"" has Megadeth combining the best of the old with the best of the new. Granted this is not as heavy as earlier works like ""Peace Sells"" or ""Rust in Peace"" they do match some very heavy rifts with dark moody lyrics like in the opening track ""Disconnect"" and ""Dread in the Fugitive Mind"". Megadeth has given fans what they want everything, if you like any of Megadeths earlier works buy this now. This is definitely one of their best yet."
4,great return to the old style,"Megadeth returns to metal on this disc after experimenting with some alternative styles. The album has solos like ""Rust in Peace"" and sleek production like ""countdown to Extinction,"" which produces a great disc. However, it does have, in my opinion, the gayest Megadeth song ever, ""Moto Psycho,"" which for some reason was the first single. Disconnect, burning bridges, promises (the first slow song ever), Recipe for hate...Warhorse, Dread and the fugitive mind, Silent Scorn, Return to Hangar, and When are all great Megadeth songs. The only two that suck are ""Moto Psycho"" and the title track."
2,What's Up With That Cover?,"Ick. Juvenile too. But how's the music? Some of it's pretty dang good (DISCONNECT, BURNING BRIDGES tear it up) and some of it's lame (title track). Hey, Dave can still play but it doesn't sound like he's enjoying at this point. A definite step ahead of RISK musically if not conceptually but, still, nowhere near the heyday of RIP and CTE."

1,"Awful, awful ... GODawful - even if you're a fan of the series","Much as I loved the show, this is pure dreck ... dreck that gets even worse as it goes, falling apart totally in the last half. The lame plot is about how the gang tries to get back on the air after realizing they're canceled, but from there stupid gets moronic and even the most offensive of jokes just aren't funny. Bad animation, lazy writing, and a stupid did-they-just-get-tired-of-writing-this-drivel ending all add up to staying away from this turkey - no matter HOW much you like the show. If I could have, I would have given this just a half-star rating; yeah, it's THAT bad."
1,Nothing like the series,"I'm not sure a one-star is correct, but I can't see a reason to like this movie. At all. I loved every moment of the TV series, it was brilliant. Just like other 30 minute shows, this does not work in a 1.5 hour format. It felt like 3 hours. This movie should work because the concept is great, but it just was not funny or funny-nasty. The opening scene, stepping on kittens and puppies, not amuzing. To me."
2,the movie,"As a huge fan of the series I was really looking forward to the movie. It was ok but not as good as it could be. I was very disapointed. If your a fan get it, if your new, your better of getting either season 1 or 2. I hope they make another movie and do better, or I'd prefer the series comes back. Also what's the deal having 3D parts and not including the glasses, very stupid however I used my glasses from my bloody valentine 3D (red and blue lenses) and I must say I was very disapointed in the 3D effect, still saw the double linning and it looked like parts stood out at times and other parts that should stand out don't. I know they can do better I've seen the proof but this was a major let down. Oh and they didn't even bother putting in a 12 year old girl and a donkey."
2,Stupid,Funny dark humor but still just plain stupid.Could have been alot better. And did I mention retarded. Certainly not for young viewers.
2,What the...?!!?,"I'd like to be able to post a coherent review of this, but my copy of the DVD was defective (I have returned it and am awaiting a replacement); the disc played the film in random order, often skipping to a different scene before the scene that was running had finished, so it was very disorienting and surreal. At first I thought the disjointedness was some kind of gag that would eventually pay off, like the characters were being mentally manipulated into a state of random confusion that they would eventually awaken from, but after about twenty minutes of the film making no linear sense whatsoever I finally realized what was up. Very bizarre experience, and the rating is based on what I could piece together from what I saw. I expected better from this series, and the new flash animation style looks like $#!+"
2,Disappointing,"It's like this movie was made just to flip the bird to Comedy Central. It's a huge, disgusting, festering dump that the producers chose to take on the network, and on the fans, too.I've seen episodes of the show that are funnier than this movie, which really should have been something considering what they are able to get away with here.It's pretty much just gross to be gross, and as a result, it's boring and pretty stupid (especially the end, where it REALLY starts to drag).I give it two stars--one for the uncensored swearing, and the other... well, you'll know what I mean when you see how it ends."
5,Completely satisfied,I am completely satisfied with the item and it arrived in a sufficient amount of time.
3,Kinda weird,Dont really know how to feel about this one tho.. Love the series they tried to over do it to make a couple extra bucks..
4,Very Funny too!,"A bit like a long episode of the show, but still very funny. I prefer to watch the series episodes."
2,Bleh.,"Were the writing staff taking a nap or just out of practice by the time the movie was made? Slightly different look, sound and rhythm makes it seem like a ""direct-to-video"" Disney movie that's just being naughty. Maybe one laugh in the whole flic."
1,What Happened?,"I'm a big fan of the Drawn Together series. I own all three dvd seasons as well. So when I heard there was a movie coming out I was stoked. I'm very sad to say though that the movie is just completely terrible. My wife and I both hated it. To make matters worse they had to change their animation for budget reasons so the movie looks like a glorified internet flash cartoon. That might not bother some,and I know that was the best they could do, but it bugged me the whole way through.Lastly...I figured that if the story wasn't that great there would at least be great jokes throughout that saved the film. Well there wasn't. I actually didn't laugh much at anything. Somehow it even managed to not be funny. After it was over we were both literally depressed at how bad it was.That's just our opinion though. Hopefully there's more people that like it. Once more I loved the series. Literally every episode was great. But...I don't know what happened to the movie..."
1,Not nearly as good as the series...,"This was majorly disappointing. We absolutely loved the show, and were really excited to see the movie. It definitely fell short of expectations. The animation was done by a different company, so the characters didn't look right; this would have been excusable if the story had been good. But it wasn't. They spent more time trying to get every dirty joke in that they couldn't put in the series (which wasn't much) than actually making the story worth watching. I wish we wouldn't have watched the movie, and let Drawn Together end with the series."
3,Average at best,"I was a fan of the series, and I actually was a little disappointed when it was taken of the air.It's a okay movie and nothing more, if you have seen drawn together you know what you're getting (extremely offensive and disturbing entertainment.) And I'm fine with that, the problem was that the jokes wasn't that funny, and nothing really happens. Overall a mediocre movie.If you're not a fan I'd stay away, If you however are a fan with money to burn,you could do a lot worse than purchasing this movie.SGH"
3,Nothing to write home about,"I have to concur with the majority that this movie was okay. I've seen all the seasons of Drawn Together and the crude, extreme humor is what made me such a fan in the first place. This movie was more like Drawn Together Lite. I laughed at some things, but the humor was toned down for reasons I can't figure out. It's not a bad film...it just didn't make me crack up like the series did. Then again, I should know better than to expect a direct-to-DVD film to be spectacular.So if you want to see it, go for it. You're just not missing too much."
4,"Like the show, like the movie","This movie is just as rude and crude as the uncensored version of the show. The basic plot is that the Drawn Together gang finds out their show has been canceled because they are able to curse without being bleeped. They then go on a quest to get back on TV.This movie is kind of short, only 70min, but it packs a lot of action and spoofs in that time. I won't spoil any spoofs, but just about every cartoon style gets spoofed."
3,"Wow, even more foul than expected.","Foul and offensive for the sake of foul and offensive. The original puched limits this just gathered what couldn't, sanely, be used before and shoved it around with a filthy mop. Real discusting, and as a fan of the oriiginal that is saying something"
2,"If this was the best they could do, be glad the show was canceled when it was great.","So I love Drawn Together, and like many people, I was disappointed when the show was canceled. But it was only recently I heard there was a movie out so I came here and immediately bought it. And I have to say, I am now glad the show left on a high note because this movie is crap. There was only 1 time where I actually laughed out loud(and I'm being generous when I say ""laughed""). If this was the best they could do for the movie, imagine what the next season would've been like. The show didn't have a long run, but it certainly had a good run. If you don't own them already, skip on buying the movie and purchase one of the seasons instead. I wish I did that instead of buying this."
4,Golf carts of the Third Reich!,"This is McCall's fourth book and I own them all, having been a fan of his work since he first began appearing in NATIONAL LAMPOON more than thirty years ago. His art is satire of a particularly sly sort, taking things to unreasonable extremes -- planes that are too huge or too heavy to fly, but which helped win the war, etc -- and his style combines realism with absurdities of scale. He's not above being political, either, as ""Mr. Bush Has a Dream"" will show. McCall produces grins rather than wild laughter, but that's okay with me. He's the reason the word ""wacky"" was invented."
1,Designed for ground-feeding birds,"There isn't a lot of difference between this feeder and most that have a similar design. I'd give one star to the lot of them. Reason? At least two thirds of the see goes on the ground. Once you see this type of feeder in action, it isn't hard to see why. The bird arrives, lands on one of the perches next to each hopper opening, and goes at the seeds. But there's nothing stopping the seeds that the bird didn't get hold of from falling through the gap between perch and opening. I set a tray on the ground to catch most of the seed, then wondered why I bothered to make up for a stupid design.There's a reason why the old, home-made wooden bird feeders were platforms with roofs. The bird food stayed in the feeder."
4,Worth the price,"I got this tray for a friend who loves clean danish design and serving tea. I would rate it five stars, but the dark stain on one side is smudged onto the lighter wood and it throws off the clean design of the piece. Otherwise, it is a well made, sturdy, smooth and beautiful tray, well worth the price. It showed up extremely fast. Also, on my screen, the darker stain color looks a lot warmer than it is in real life. It actually is more of a ashy brown, but it matches well with the blonde wood so it's still fine."
3,...,i did recieve this product on time.. it does makes my dogs' coats very clean and soft after their bath. thanks
5,AMAZING,"Soda is amazing!!! Handsome is such a good, fun song. I need to hear more from this artist. Everyone support her and buy this great single!"
5,Have a little taste of SODA!,"SODA's the next big thing to hit the US, Her song ""Handsome"" which is one of my faves is being requested @ radio stations all over the country so why not check her out?"
1,buyer beware,this is a poorly made product. The material is okay but the workmanship is extremely poor. The first time worn I could not get the zipper pulled up. The two sides of the zipper do not align. Im not sure how this happens because as I understand it a zipper is sewn into place in a closed position so both sides match. Would not buy again even at this price.
1,Wrong size,"For the price I expected them to at least fit. The size chart for these shorts is way, way off. Chart showed XL= 33.5""-35"" waist, the actual measurement was 43"". I wear a 34"". I'll try to return them but an exchange is impossible because I don't know what size to exghange for. If you can get them to fit, they might be good shorts. This could be a scam to unload over stock."
3,a belt built in on the inside???,"Seriously, why is this here? I will probably cut it out but have not yet because I'm lazy. The shorts fit and are comfortable, seem sturdy but only wore them once so far. The inside belt both creeps me out and confuses me. It such a stupid waste of fabric and makes me want to kick the designer in the shines while tell them to knock it off. Why would I ever want to have to tie an knot around my fat belly when there is a perfectly fine working button on the front of the shorts. I would not by again because I've already spent to much time pondering the flawed design of shorts."
