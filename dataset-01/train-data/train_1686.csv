1,"This is a Petrol case, not branded Panasonic","The item description for this bag is wrong. Amazon is selling a different item. The item I received had a Petrol logo on the inside claiming it was manufactured in 1996 in Tel-Aviv, and it has a label on the outside that says Petrol. The photo on the website is of a different bag. It seems like an OK bag, but why would anyone pay a premium price of $150 for a knock off bag? I'm returning it today."
4,Wonderful performance,"This performance was wonderful, full of lovely interpretation and enough showmanship to make it interesting."
3,I got it,"I finally recieved my cd after a month, I really like it except it hasa couple of the wrong songs listed. The cover that you see is not the coverthat I recieved,(when I finally recieved it). I ordered it for a partythat we had planned and wouldn't you know it, I got it a week late.But, in all it is a Chartbuster cd and you can't go wrong with a Chart-buster Karaoke CD. Even though it took a while for me to recieve it, Itis a great cd, after all It's Reba! It was worth the wait!Tena from Tennessee"
1,This movie's horrible.,"This movie is so bad, Kids should not see it. It's like a kidergarden student wrote this movie! You know what they shouldve put in? How about characters not liscenced, bad guys, talking animals, and a better backstory. They shouldve called the movie ""The Amazing Missing Dog Adventure"", Which was probaly what they had in mind before they thought, ""No wait! Make it about Arthur! We already ruiend Casper and Barbie, Now let's do the same thing with Arthur."" And that's right, it's by Mainframe Entertainment."
2,Arthur misses the mark,"As an avid fan of the Arthur television series, I found his first CGI movie to be very disappointing. The pace of the story was rather slow and uninspired, and it looked more like a computer game than an animated movie. A lot of the clever and humerous dialog I expect from the series is strangely absent. I recommend instead, Arthur: It's Only Rock 'n Roll, which is my favorite Arthur special."
5,Enjoyed!,"My son loves his DVD player and movies, and this was one on his list. Unfortunately, it's already gotten scratched and won't play. It was fun while it lasted :)"
4,Spin Roulette Gold - excellent Book,"For all you good people out there who are looking for information on how to win at Roulette, this book will give you some good ideas on how to look for bias wheels and play dealers signature. Frank shows you how to play a system called the double dynamite system which works very well specially on older wheels. What I liked most about this book is the fact that it gives you actual recorded spins to test out your systems on. I have used his spins to develop systems. Excellent book. The only thing that I was dissapointed with this book was the fact that he did not explain about how to use visual ballistic techniques. I would advise to buy both this book and Chris Pawlacki book get the edge at roulette as he goes into detain about visual wheel tracking techniques."
5,Excellent Resource,This is an encyclopedia of roulette with every possible way of analyzing the game. Good book to get for those interested in knowing about the game.
5,A Must Read Roulette Book,The two best roulette books around are this one and beating the Wheel by Russell Barnhart. Scoblete's book is overall the most comprehensive of any roulette book ever written and also a very enjoyable book to read. This is a must read for roulette players.
3,"Close, but No Cigar","Some aspects of this book can work, wheel bias for example, but by the time you chart a dealer, he's on break. I did win $80 in 12 hrs. Mr. S. is fun reading, and does make some excellent points, but none of the suggested systems will work for any period of time. I found a system that shows you are not just making bets, but rather competing with the skill of the dealer, and how to beat them. They show that roulette is not random at all which is what makes Mr. Scoblete's and any other systems I've tested nearly worthless. It is called Casino Secrets. Frank you could learn from them. Their secrets make all the difference in the world. It's nice to be a winner for a change."
3,Nice but...,"This is a nice book, however I haven't encountered explanations about how professionals win at roulette as Frank Scoblete promises at the cover. I have found funny systems that can sound ridiculous for advanced players like me, and can jeopardize the money of novices. Besides, its systems don't have serious management money. Spin Roulette Gold's value ($11,96) is fair and has a respectable idea about the unique form to beat the wheel, which is finding a dealer signature or a biased roulette. In my opinion, people buying this book won't waste their money but won't discover how to bet the roulette."
5,Fabulous Book Worth Reading,"I like to play roulette and I always would play my ""lucky"" numbers and I always wound up losing. Scoblete's book put me straight and I now use a strategy that he calls big number betting and it seems to have helped me a lot. This book is very comprehensive and also allot of fun to read."
5,Great book for strategies,This is a great book for players who want to maximize their chances of winning. Scoblete can also write an enjoyable book that is fun to read. I really liked his sections on the differences between layout strategies and wheel strategies. This is a very worthwhile book for anyone who likes to play roulette.
3,Little info on making money from a random wheel,"I have tried a system mentioned in this book but couldn't make much money and when I tried to make more, I lost my winnings. For the random wheel, the author merely show how to sustain playing for a considerable time but does not show any substantial technique to bring in the cash. This book is only good for reading as the author's style makes for enjoyable coffee table material, but not for winning money on the random wheel which I have to deal with."
3,Neat Book,I found the book very interesting overall. There are some parts that drag on but all in all a neat book. It tells the details of a great golfer Francis Ouimet. It was written in the 1930s and I am sure some of the details have been sugar coated but if a person like history and likes golf you will like this book!
5,Excellent!,"I'm a relatively new fan. Very Very happy with this purchase.. I'm a ""sucker for anything acoustic"" so I'm really pleased. They are one of the greatest bands out right now catchy hooks and melodies. I was curious to see how they would come across acoustic and I think it works really well. If your a fan of this genre and want to try something new this CD is it."
3,3 1/2 stars--Where is he now???,"Richie Rich - Seasoned Veteran (Def Jam, 1996)You may remember Richie Rich from rhyming with 2Pac and The Luniz, among other West Coast rappers. This album was pretty decent, with my favorite songs being ""Do G's Get to Go to Heaven"", ""Let's Ride"" (a classic), and ""N's Done Changed"" with 2Pac (""No more regular rapping!""). It's weird that T-Boz's ""Touch Myself"" remix was on here but I liked that song so I'm glad it was. Everything else was okay but the songs that stood out were the ones I mentioned. -EJR"
4,"You have to be from the ""O"" to really know!","Rich, even if I did not know you personally, I would say your cd is bomb! For the most part, I don't think you are marketed well enough. Locally and in certain other regions of this nation, folks got mad love for you. Personally, I think most of your love comes right from the Yay Area and that's cool, too. Rich is the original ""Mr. Raspy"" so if you were thinking it was that dude from the east coast, give ""Seasoned Veteran"" a taste. They don't want to fool with Double R! Most of your lyrics pertain to experiences that could only happen in Oakland so outsiders may be clueless. Believe me, it goes on everywhere: Blowin' dozier, whoriding, all that but nobody does it like they do it in the Yay! Much success Rich..."
3,3 Stars is pushin it....,"R.R. has really just one reason he's not the exact same as every other west coast rapper sorry to say but its just his voice.Becides that you could take the lyrics away from his songs and it'll sound just like any other rapper out there.Only get this one if your not lookin for an original, break-through tape."
3,a C- book,"This book had many basic flaws. The author assumed that the readers would know all the religious terms and periods presented in the book. In places, words that didn't exist in 1532 were used. For example, bedlam was used. The first earliest use of the word was in 1572. There was too much writing about how dirty and smelly the various monks were, and who needs to hear about the toilet habits of the unwashed monks. The book had a chance to be much better. It had a good plot twist, but that got lost in too many unnecessary, distracting details. The ending was very good, but to struggle through a book that was overly ""described"" took away from the story. I give it a two star rating or perhaps a C- score."
5,A WALK THROUGH HENRY VIII'S REFORMATIOM,IT IS A GRAPHICALLY TOLD STORY OF AN INTERESTING PERIOD ALONG WITH A MYSTERY. THE CHARACTERS ARE SO WELL DRAWN THAT I FELT I KNEW THEM PERSONALLY. C.J. SANSOM IS A MASTER IN DESCRIPTIVE DETAILS. HISTORY BUFFS AND MYSTERY FANS NEED TO READ THE SHARDLAKE SERIES AS I DID. NAOMI WILLIAMS
3,Just okay for me....,"Based on all of the great reviews, and the fact that I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and mysteries, I thought I'd love this book. Unfortunately, I didn't. The premise of the story is good, but I just never connected with the characters or the plot. Not sure why, but it just didn't work for me."
2,Disappointing,"Having read so many rave reviews of this book, I was very disappointed. Shardlake isn't particularly appealing as a person and he is disorganized and ineffective as a detective. There are so many clues and ideas that he completely fails to follow through with. If this had been a longer book or the author less skilled with inserting interesting historical bits, I'd never have finished it."
3,Mediocre historical mystery,"It's not horrible, just rather predictable. Outside of its setting, it's not much different than most mysteries, that is to say, it doesn't break mediocre for me. The characters are modern but in robes, furs or rags from the past. The author takes his pokes at homophobia, torture, the treatment of women, and the wealthy in a very modern way. I want to be immersed in the past, not in a modern ethos that happens to be set in the past. And it's not too hard to figure out who the killer is. Think, who would most be unlikely in the past to garner enough respect to even be considered capable...hmmm? That said, it was still a mildly entertaining read."
3,Good Historical Fiction,"This was a good mystery but try as I may I could never get around to liking the main character, Matthew Shardlake. Maybe the fact that he's a hunchback is supposed to make the reader have some sympathy, but I couldn't relate. He's was a bit of a grouch. Besides the mystery there is a good bit of history for anyone interested in how the Protestant church got its start."
4,16th Century Historical Mystery,"Dissolution (2003) introduces Matthew Shardlake, a lawyer in Tudor England. It's 1537, and Shardlake has been sent to the Benedictine monastery at Scarnsea, Sussex, by Lord Cromwell to investigate the murder of a king's commissioner. Using reports from the monastery inspection two years early, Cromwell hoped the commissioner could convince the abbott to voluntarily dissolve the monastery. Shardlake soon discovers evidence of sexual misconduct, embezzlement, and treason. Sansom brings the Reformation to life with plenty of atmosphere and a clever plot. Shardlake is a hunchback, but his brilliant intellect more than compensate for his physical limitations. He is compassionate and committed to the ideals of Cromwell's reforms, but is growing increasingly wary of the motives of his fellow reformers as the book progresses.http://www.stopyourekillingme.com/S_Authors/Sansom_C-J.html"
5,Superb book you will not want to put down,"This book (a historical mystery set in Cromwells England) and the whole serise is absoloutly brilliant, the only problem will be actualy putting it down to do the chores or go to work.Exciting and elegantly written with wonderful characterisation, Dissolution is an utterly compelling novel and a riveting portrayal of Tudor England. The year is 1537, and the country is divided between those faithful to the Catholic Church and those loyal to the king and the newly established Church of England. When a royal commissioner is brutally murdered in a monastery on the south ......"
3,Ok read,This was an ok read. I enjoyed the main character Matthew Shardlake I like that he wasn't a perfect dashing gentleman in fact he is a hunchback. His imperfections made me appreciate him even more. It was interesting how he used good old wit and ingenuity to solve a crime without forensics and all our modern science. I didn't like the parts with Thomas Cromwell it felt to contrived but it is fiction. Henry the VIII is my least favorite person in history and I liked how he was not showcased in this book. Overall it's a good rainy weekend read.
3,name of the rose lite,"THIS WAS AN OKAY SUMMER READ BUT IT WAS A REAL TURN-OFF WHEN THE AUTHOR REFERRED TO THE GOOD THIEF AS BARRABAS. THIS, OF COURSE IS A GLARING ERROR. THE GOOD THIEF IS ST. DISMAS. I WOULD THINK WITH HIS HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, SANSOM WOULD KNOW THIS(POOR RESEARCH). AND I ALSO FEEL THAT THIS IS A OBVIOUS RIP-OFF OF UMBERTO ECO'S ""NAME OF THE ROSE"", A FAR SUPERIOR BOOK. ALSO, I FOUND IT WEIRD AND UNREALISTIC FOR SHARDLAKE TO BE IMBIBING AN HERBAL ELIXIR MADE BY BROTHER GUY WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING POISONED. I'M DUMPING MY COPY AT MY LOCAL LIBRARY BECAUSE IT'S NOT A KEEPER."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing, very formulaic, no real character development. It was like the Cliffs Notes version of ""Name of the Rose,"" almost identical plot points, without the erudition and intellectual twists."
4,slow to develop,"I enjoyed this book but initially thought it was slow. I felt that there must be a first episode out there , and plan to search for more "" shardlake "" to read."
4,"Intelligent, pathos-rich sleuth","The author builds up his main character, Matthew Shardlake, extremely well in this kick-start to the series. He's treading a thin legal tightrope between Henry V111's court and Cromwell, overseeing all the radical changes that took place regarding religion and in particular monasteries and the land they owned during that period.So when there's an unexplained murder at a Sussex monastery, you know there's more at stake than just solving the crime and finding the culprit: the very future of the monastery is in the balance.With Shardlake's back deformity and associated pains brought on by the cold weather, the reader very quickly feels pathos for him. This is a flawed character, rather than a cut and thrust lawyer. The only criticism I have is that it took a while to build up a head of steam and so a punchier style might have helped in the early passages. Still, I suppose to those reared on 'Name of the Rose', it might seem a stroll in the park."
5,Dissolution,"My Husband found the 2nd book in this series (Dark Fire) in our library. After he read it he said ""you would love this book"" ! I did and immediatly went to Amazon.com to buy Dissolution which I also enjoyed. Of course I then ordered the next three books (Not on my Kindle because I wanted to share).The books are wonderfully written with a history lesson included."
3,Dissappointed at first,"I purchased this for my 2 yr old for Christmas. Like others the clock did not work. However; my son just loves the piano and drums so much that he did not notice the other part not working. I called fisherprice and they sent me a new clock/keyboard free of charge and that one did work. I was very suprised that FP had an item that did not work. There customer service was excellent. I really wish this item came with the stool pictured on the box. I think I finally found which stool that is. It looks like the green MAMMUT Children's stool sold by IKEA. I am going out today to get it since it is hard getting a single chair anywhere. They usually come in pairs. Besides all the problems this item had at first, I would definitely recommend it. I am giving 3 stars since it did not work at first and because it doesn't come with the stool. Otherwise it would have 5 stars."
5,Very good buy,"We bought this for our son at Xmas when he was 2.5 and he's played with it every day since. There's much to do and lots to learn and I really like that you don't hear the same song over and over.It could be a little sturdier and the lid could be a little easier to pull down, but other than that it's well worth the money and I would recommend this to anyone who asked about it."
1,Pathetic excuse for a toy.,"First of all, the only toys that I ever owned as a child were made by Fisher-Price. I'm sorry to say that quality control is no longer a priority. Like numerous previous reviewers, the clock (which controls all of the ""learning functions"" on the table) does not work. I have tried 2 units, both of which have this problem - and I will not be going back for a 3rd one. This product needs to be pulled from the shelves."
2,Nice But Won't Turn Off!!,My wife and I bought this for our son for Christmas. While putting it together on Christmas Eve I found that the On/Off switch does not work. No matter what I do the toy remains on all the time (luckily it has a sleep mode). I called Fisher Price about the problem and they want me to take it apart and send in the desk and clock portion (at my expense) to them and they will send replacements in 4-6 weeks. I cannot do this since my son loves to play with it. I bought an item from Little Tikes and they are sending me the item with in 10 business days. Fisher Price really disappointed me.
1,Very disappointed on Christmas,"This was the ""big gift"" from Santa. After trying 3 different sets of batteries and taking it apart to examine the problem several times, we have no sound. The lights work on the clock and the alphabet/number/shape displays work fine, but we have no sound on either side. We also have no lights on the piano part.My 3yr old teacher-wannabe was upset."
4,Needs work..,"We bought this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. Like for so many others, our clock didn't work. Serious dissapointment. BUT we called the company and they sent us out a new clock and keyboard, free of charge, and now it's working fine. I suggest others call the company too! And our daughter LOVES it now!"
1,"suprise, suprise, clock doesn't work","o.k. so just got done putting this together with my mother-in-law, only to find out that the clock doesn't work. She brought it back to Toys R Us, only to find that they had none in stock. She called around in a one hour radius to find it for my 3 and 2 year olds who really wanted it to work. No stores have them. Decide to check to see if any were in stock on line and saw all the reviews. Next time I will read the reviews first to see if I should bother putting something together. Live and Learn.I too am very suprised about all of the clocks not working. Should definately be a recall."
4,I would buy this again. 2 years later & our daughter still plays with it often!,"This was a Chanukah gift almost 2 years ago when she was 1 1/2 yrs. old.. At first my daughter banged on the piano keys and the drums. Now she is 3 1/2 and she still oves this. She draws on the desk, and loves to play the music, the different sounds and tunes as well as the piano and she now loves to dance to the music it plays.She never did use the learning tools it comes with. Maybe in due time she will (clock, numbers, letters, etc.). We have a small place, but this is one toy I won't be getting rid of anytime soon. For us it's a toy 2 years later she still plays with often.Note: The first one we got didn't work with new batteries and exchanged it. The second one we got works great and we haven't had to changed the batteries yet."
4,Play toy,"This toy is great, its a little harder to put together than it says little assembly not so true, but it gives men a little practice"
2,"Defective, Obnoxious & Loud","I bought this for my daughters 2nd birthday. She loved to colour, and so I figured that she and her brother could share this as a learning tool. Well ... that is not what is happening! The Top Panel (with the clock Face on it) is supposed to insert a certain way so that some electronics can match up and connect together so the learning stuff works ... well, they did not match up, nor can we take it back apart to try and reallign the connections!!! We were told that the toy is not defective ... that the error is our and we are stuck with just another ""piano"" type toy ... we already have several of those!!! But all in all, our kids love it!!!"
1,Don't waste time or money,"This toy is a real disappointment. I bought it for our 2 year old for Christmas and realized after putting it together that it is very flimsy. She enjoyed turning the hands on the clock, although it did not work, but to do this she had to lean across the desk. The desk part bends very easily and tilted over every time she reached over to play with the clock. She also almost pinched her fingers when switching the desk up and down. This should be recalled for safety reasons or change the age range. Needless to say, I returned this to the store and got a refund. This toy really deserves a no-star rating."
4,ours worked fine,"My dad got this for my daughter for Christmas. After my husband put it together it worked just fine, including the clock portion. After reading the reviews I went and checked to make sure mine worked. She is 17 months and is interested in the music part for now. I hope as she grows she will like the drawing and writing parts as well. :)"
1,product did not work,My three year old received the Fun 2 Learn Preschool Center for her birthday. The clock on the table did not work. She could only use the keyboard. I call the company and they didnt have any replacement parts and said I would have to ship the product back. They would then issue a refund less shipping back to me in 4 to 6 weeks. My three year old didnt under stand why she could not play with her new toy. I would not recommend this product. The company should be able to support its product once on the market.
1,Christmas Disappointment,"We bought this for our daughter and asembled it on Christmas Eve. None of the top section worked (including the clock), no matter what we did. We weren't able to give it to our little one for Christmas, because we didn't want to have to take it away to return it. We ended up returning it today and are thinking of buying a Step 2 art desk instead (it got GREAT reviews). Don't buy the preschool center - it is a piece of junk."
3,Frustrating!,"I just put this toy together last night, and like the other reviews, the clock piece does not work. This part controls all of the learning exercises. My daughter loves the piano and drum part, which does work. FRUSTRATING!!"
1,Second one not working either ...,"We got this for our 2 1/2 year old. She seems to like it. The first one we opened on 12/24 ... the clock wasn't working. You can't take it apart anymore, so I had to buy an additional box to ship that part back to Amazon (I notified them on 12/25). I shipped it back on 12/26 and on 12/27 I got the second one in ... same problem, clock not working (at first the piano wasn't either). I called FP, they are not aware of any issues (at this moment). They are going to ship me a new key board with clock. If that doesn't work, I'll ship it back and give up. I tried my best. This is my first bad experience with a FP toy."
5,comfy pillow,"Love it love it love it. This is my second one of these. Wait, I thought I already wrote a review of this product. Anyway, it's great for my chronic neck aches. That's where I carry my stress and this allows me to sleep comfortably and not wake up in pain with muscle spasms. I highly recommend it."
1,Useless,Does not seem necessary at all. It barely makes the pillow more soft and cushioned. Felt like a waste of money.
4,Good Cover,"Nice cover, definitely going to help the pillow last. Zipper could be designed better though, part of it doesn't fully zip because of the pillows shape."
4,Great Product just Heavy,"I finally found a pillow that allows me to sleep comfortably on my side. I have wide shoulders and have spent a lot of money trying all kinds of different pillows. This product works the best. I just wish it did not have to be so heavy. I an used to moving my pillow during the night and it is difficult. That said, i would buy this product again and recommend others use it."
4,A must have for your pillow,I bought this for my new Chiroflow pillow and it works wonderful while adding extra comfort!It really is a must have if you have purchased the pillow!
3,Not Happy only 50% covered,I thought I was getting Quilted cover 100%I received a pillow covered on one side only.The backside covering like Gauze.
4,Good memories,I grew up watching Quick draw Mcgraw and it was well worth the money to relive those moments. I now watch them with my grandson.
1,Not compatible with my Sony Ericsson z500a,This battery was not compatible with my Cingular Wireless-Sony Ericsson z500a phone. My phone has the battery contactson the end of the battery (near the hinge) and this batteryhas its contacts on the bottom of it. Not exactly a perfectmatch......
1,Not NEW as described...VERY USED!,"I received this battery in a opened box, the label on the front was half torn off & the other side had grease on it like it was run over by a car. Needless to say I returned it for a full refund & will never order from this seller again...BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Download and Save $$$$$$,"Thanks to my fellow Amazonians berrating of this release, I have enacted my inaliable rights as a consumer and put that $20 back in my pocket.I have instead chose to download it instead for nothing-whats it costing me nothing!I think its just as far and sort of like someone reimburssing me for me wasting cash on crappy releases in the past from that dyanmic-duo....when in doubt download.I mean how many times have we bought an album and found out its utter garbage!"
1,Rip-off!!!,"I was excited to see a new Jerky Boys CD after such a long hiatus. Going to the website reveals nothing substantial about this CD and apparently that's intentional, because this CD is a big rip-off. 98 tracks on the CD and only five or six are devoted to calls. A couple are funny, the rest are so-so. I had heard about the split between Johnny Brennan and Kamal, and when there was a new CD marketed under the Jerky Boys name after so long, I'd assumed they had patched things up. Wrong again. It's all Johnny Brennan. The rest of the tracks are rehashes of Brennan characters doing bits from old calls and packaging them as answering machine messages or ringtones."
1,Horrible...just horrible.,"Coming from an avid Jerky Boys fan -- I still listen to their other cd's all the time and STILL laugh -- this cd is a complete waste of time. 1 star is not low enough for the piece of garbage unworthy of the Jerky Boys' Signature.Trust me, don't buy this. It's a complete waste of time. Stick with the Jerky Tapes, and CD's 3 & 4."
2,"A disappointment, by far the worst album to date","As others have said, this is a disappointing release. I am a huge fan of the boys and was eagerly awaiting lots of new calls, but instead got 96 tracks of re-recorded snippets of past jerky boy calls and 6 so-so prank calls. I too think all the voicemail and ring tones should have been released for free on the web site.The calls that are on the CD have their moments, but not one of them comes close with the classic calls on previous CDs.I would have liked to hear a bunch of calls that went bad where the callers knew who it was or the call derailed in some other way. At least that would have been new material and I am sure some of it is very funny. Brennan has to have dozens of calls like this if he was still making them at the height of their popularity.I really hope Brennan releases a killer CD next or it might be the end of a true comedy legacy."
2,I got my copy autographed.,"I met Johnny Brennan and he sold me this CD. It mostly features short sound bites intended to be used as voicemails or ringtones. These are basically the characters from previous Jerky Boys album repeating their catchphrases. A few of these are somewhat amusing, but not THAT amusing. I also doubt that very many people will want to use these vulgar soundbites as ringtones, because it would be embarrassing to have your phone yelling out cursewords. There are also a handful of prank phone calls that aren't nearly as funny as the ""classic"" Jerky Boys calls. Worst Jerky Boys album ever."
1,Broke within a year,I bought this nutcracker less than a year ago and have used it very little. It broke in half a few weeks ago and is now completely useless and will have to be tossed. Look for something sturdier even if you only occasionally plan to crack nuts!
2,The Prime Of Sir Douglas Quintet,"I;ve been looking for this group only to be told in stores that they were out of print. What I really want is a cd with ALL their hits I so loved in the 60""s. Songs like Mendicino, etc. Any ideas ou there,thanks Email me at Nachomom@aol.com"
4,Nice lotion,"Good body lotion for leaving in the shower. No overly oily and not smell! :-) If you can't find it locally, this order works well. Large 16 oz bottles!"
4,Only because the derm recommended it!,"This lotion is greasy! And does not absorb into the skin, but rather washes off. If I hadn't already bought 2 bottles of it here, I wouldn't buy it! It's what most derms recommend but I'm not convinced."
5,Great point! - Do we really know who Smokie was?,"You shouldn't be old to remember Smokie and Chris Norman's voice! Unfortunately, that's the case in US. Not too many youngsters (I'm not sure too many older ones either) know or ever heard about Smokie the brits and not Smokey ... Robinson! And so, a strange, grave, mystic and still so attractive music is left back in the 70's, with those now women (then girls) screaming for a piece of Chris's hair! I believe someone should revive those sweet sounds in today's music stores. I bet a lot of people will be surprised by the freshness of the old wave... Living next door to Alice and Needles and Pins are just two of the songs many would cry after! Too bad here they are not even existing!"
3,Good thrash,"I remember seeing an ad for this cd and I thought ""cool cover"". I dont remember if I heard anything good about the cd but I still got it. I popped in the cd and laughed. The lead singer is not the greatest singer in the world and the music is pretty generic. In there booklet it reads ""Thrash Metal's Future Warriors"". I dont know about that. The Much Hate dedication is pretty funny to read. I played this on Media Player and they rated this half a star. Not a full one, a half of one. Tells you what Media Player thinks of them. Glad I got it? It might grow on me."
2,Buy a singer,"I'd like to listen to this album; I really would. But I keep turning it off after about 30 seconds of that awful voice. It's like listening to American Idol tryouts, and awkwardly laughing at how bad they are. Seriously... buy a singer, do only instrumentals, get possessed and develop a graveyard voice...something."
2,does'nt do it..,"I really tried to like this. Love the cover, the concept, the production, the sneakers, the song titles and the whole damn vibe...But why cant I ever get through this cd without turning it off in disgust. Each time I get a little further into it, but I always end up saying ""ouch this is awful"" and I have to take it off. I'm a guy who can listen to anything at all even the most extreme. But this stuff rubs me the wrong way,the sloppy execution is ok if you got good riffs instead of one cliche part after another and no feeling or power behind the vocals. Got to be the worst vocal performance out there.They got the right idea so I'll give 'em 2 stars for that. I will say no more because I dont like to bash any band out there...."
4,Very good photo book,"Most photo books are now geared toward scrap booking, so it's hard for me to find this type of photo book that I have used for the last 30 years. When I do find them, most of them have very flimsy pages that don't stick well. These photo pages are much better. The pages are a good size and stick fairly well. Over all very happy with the photo book. The down side is you can't pick your color, but I ordered several books and they gave me a nice selection."
2,Would not purchase another one,"Overall, not satisfied with this purchase and would NOT purchase another. However, for the sake on balance:Pros:1) Lots of pages so you can fit many photos and photos of a range of sizes.2) Brown color is very nice.Cons:1) Did not appear to be in new condition. Old, ragged, bent edges.2) Magnetic pages were dirty. Almost half of them had red streaks on the plastic and some of them were dirty on the white part too.3) Magnetic pages did not smoothly cover the photos. LOTS of air pockets remain."
3,Too small,"The individual photo pages have a usable space of roughly 8"" wide by 10 1/2"" high and only hold 2 4x6 photos. For me this was too small and not really usable, and is being returned."
3,pionner photo 100 page magnetic album,"to collect newspaper clip like I did is really practical with this product. It is also great that you could add pages or switch them in the future. The only downside woith newspapaers clips is if you decide to change your mind. when you take them out, they let a trace on the page, which is not very nice or esthetic. Otherwise, it is great!"
3,It works.,"I ordered the blue cover, but got white cover. I guess it works. I hope they have bigger size to fit letter size photos."
4,Safety Girl Roadside Kit,The Safety Girl Roadside kit was a novelty gift that I thought was cute to give a first time driver. I think it could have been improved by changing the matches to a mini flashlight. Taking the chocolate out and maybe adding some reflective tape. The container was the size of a lunch box and the grafics on the outside were nice.
4,Too Cute,"I think this is a cute novelty item and gift to give to friends and female family members for their cars. I don't think it is completely practical but it does have some nice essentials for non car related emergencies, and a couple of good actual emergency items. I have one for myself and will be giving a couple as gifts but I think an actual road side assistance kit is needed to go with this."
5,"nice large lamination pouches, but keep in mind that 3mm is very thin","These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size. I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members. She draws a picture and we laminate it. Pretty easy. Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin. I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose. Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5"" wide pouch."
2,READ HERE BECAUSE YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!,"The book that I was reading was Too Popular, from the series Sweet Valley Jr. High. Some things that I liked about the book were the competition and when Jessica blurted out Ronald's most embarassing secret. I also loved the romance between Jessica and Damon at the end. I truthfully think this is a great book for a teenage girl. I recomend that any girl between the ages of twelve and sixteen read this book."
4,Very awesome!,This book was great!! I've read the whole series... not in order unfortunely... and the books just get better. I'd recommend this to girls between 11-14... I'm now starting on the Sweet Valley High series... hope it's as good! :-)
5,You have to read this book.,"Too Popular is one of my favorites in the Sweet Valley Jr. High Series. I also like #19 She Loves Me...Not. It's probably my favorite. I highly suggest you read this book, because it is really good. I was glad to see Jessica and Damon start going out, and it was soo sweet how he asked her!"
1,Outmoded view of Africans,"The book is about a white guardian angel whose task is to save a stupid, disobedient African boy, Shiny-John, so the boy's soul becomes white. It presents a dated, condescending view of black Africans as ignorant cannibals and devil worshippers in need of saving so their souls become white."
2,Stunk up my whole kitchen!,"When this item was delivered and I opened the box, the smell was overpowering...AND the bottle was wrapped and sealed in bubble wrap! When I took the bottle out of the bubble wrap (the bottle was closed) and put it on my counter, it stunk up my whole kitchen. After about an hour of the smell, I had to put the bottle into one of those zipper-seal sandwich bags. Even though it's now in a zippered bag, I can still smell it when I'm close to the bottle. I can't comment on the quality of the product as I've only been able to stand taking 3 drops for the last 2 days (for fear I would stink up the corner coffee shop when I went for coffee). Sorry, but I would not order this product again."
1,Not up to the job.,It may work on boats and generators but I had no success trying to use it on my car. The suction was not nearly strong enough to bring the oil more than 3 feet up the tube.
1,Topside oil changer problems,The Topsider Oil Changer did not work as advertised. I purchased it to use to change the oil in my 96 Honda Civic. The Topsider would not pump the oil out of the drain pan. I tried approximately 22 times to get the unit to pump and it would not. I followed all the procedures provided in the user guide. The Topsider did not work!
3,Topsider Works Great,"I have had one of these for five or six years and use it exclusively for changing oil in my cars, lawnmower and tractor. It does the job just fine. The only catch is you must use it with the oil warm. If the oil is cold, it does not have enough suction to evacuate the drain pan. I recently needed to replace the pump and the company sent one immediately, at very reasonable cost. This is a much better way to change oil for the do-it-yourselfer. Recommended!"
1,Seals do not allow enough vacuum to pull warm oil out,"I've tried to seal the washer connection with oil, grease, petroleum jelly, but the seals leak and it will not pull oil out of the crankcase. If someone has found a good seal (permatex, etc.) please let me know."
4,"Great, just follow directions.",If you follow the directions and warm the oil by letting the engine run about 4-5 minutes minutes it is very easy.It amazes me that people who do not follow this part of the directions gave bad reviews. It is sort of like swallowing an alka selter tablet and then writing a bad review saying that it made their stomach explode (If they live). If the directions say DISOLVE IN WATER then do so.
5,Complete course means COMPLETE COURSE,"Excellent book. Goes beyond simple grammar. Covers grammar, composition, aids to good english, speaking & listening, and mechanics. Great reference book!"
1,Phooey on the post office--item never received!,Seller was as helpful as she could be and refunded the purchase price after the post office failed to deliver the book.
4,great snack for toddlers,"My kids (1 and 3 years old) love these. They make a great snack because they are not full of refined sugar, but still taste sweet."
2,Way too sweet...,If you make your own baby food and have been avoiding added sugar and salt - this snack is not for your baby. It is un-naturally sweet! Make your own... It will be nicer on your pocketbook and you can control the amount of sugar!!
4,Great Breakfast Addition For Tots,"I LOVE these organic cereal bars and I love giving them to my daughter. I usually couple one of these bars with a banana and some yogurt for her breakfast, and she always goes for the bar first (she LOVES bananas, so that's definitely saying a lot). Definitely preferable to the breakfast bars laden with HFCS and ingredients whose names you cannot even pronounce. The only reason I am giving these 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a tad on the small side. Would be nice if there were just a little bit bigger! (My tot is a lean one, but when she finds a food she likes, she could eat it all day - I wish one of these would last her a little bit longer!)"
5,My daughter's favorite cereal bar,This is by far my daughter's favorite cereal bar. She usually has one for a snack everyday. I've tried others but she likes these the best. And they are vitamin and iron fortified so I feel like I'm not just giving her empty calories.
3,"Convenient Snack, but too sweet","I got these at snacks for my toddler (20 months). They're pretty convenient, but I don't love the taste of them, and neither does my daughter. She'll usually eat them, but sometimes won't (unlike other fruit bars I've given her). I find them too sweet."
3,"good bar, a little messy","my 18 month old liked these bars, however they seemed a little messy (crumbly texture)."
2,nice poster,"This poster is actually a very fuzzy-muted photo of Jack Johnson. It is definitely done on purpose and the way it is supposed to look, but you can't tell from the photo when purchasing it. My daughter was disappointed.The poster is still well-made and she's a big fan so it stays. Shipping was fast."
5,we only have to do this til we reach the dry sand...,"it helped me get through one of the worst nights of my life. i couldnt sleep. and so i sat there reading til the sun came through the crack in the blinds. you want to know what it's about? it's about a confused boy. but anyone who has ever felt lost can relate to him. it's written in a matter much like Stuarts Looper songs. warm, thought out, and fuzzy feeling. it's my favorite book."
4,An English Perspective,"In the times when I couldn't continue to read this book, I couldn't get it out of my mind. I felt that if I left the narrator alone for too long, I would lose him. Think of those day dreams when when you feel as if you are somewhere else, and that will set your state of mind to read this wonderful story. Can't wait for Stuart David's next."
5,The Author,"I have not yet read this book, but i will soon. Stuart David is 1/8 of a great band named Belle & Sebastian. The albums of this band should be played over the PA of all bookstores and coffee houses across the world. Their sound is beautifuly melodic and the songs are of the sort which can be played on solo piano, solo organ, acoustic guitar, you name it, and they will still sound as wonderful as the original. It's this pleasant atmosphere from their music that i am anxiously awaiting to read Nalda Said. I've read before where this book shouldn't be taken as a direct relative the the band, but Stuart David is such an excellant character, and a wonderful songwriter, that it would be stupid to pass this up. happy reading!"
4,"Now You See Him with Jack Cassidy, it's the syndication version!","I'm very disappointed that Univeral Studios couldn't put the uncut version of Now You See Him with Jack Cassidy in the set, the episode is only 1:29:04! Back in 1976, a 2-hour movies was at lease 95 min. long, there sure wasn't 31 min. of commercials, because back than the FCC had a limit on how many minutes the networks could have for commercials, all of the other episodes have the normal running time of 95-97 min. Universal shouldn't advertise these episodes as uncut, it's false advertising!"
4,SOME WEAK EPISODES--BUT STILL GOOD,"Did you know that there is an old time radio show like Columbo. It's THE WHISTLER. In one episode, the killer pushes a car into a railroad crossing, colliding with a train. And--that's the basic plot used on the Mrs Columbo extra, which is pretty good. (I enjoyed two of the three Katie installments.) Of course, the Jack Casidy one is the best, followed by that Pyscho girl's appearance as a has been movie star. The ship one is good, followed by A CASE OF IMMUNITY, and the bullfighter. The spy episode in not up to par. I quess this is the end of me buying Columbo, since I have recorded and played to death all the remaining installments. I wrote 5 episodes of a female Columbo series in an effort to give you fans some more, but I am having no luck selling the material. IT WAS A NICE RUN! PS: Anyone interested in reading my detective shows: [...]"
3,My least favorite season,"Season five is my least favorite season. I felt that the scripts were not as clever and entertaining as the previous seasons. My favorite episode in this set was, ""Now, you see him"" with Jack Cassidy playing the Great Santini who murders his blackmailing boss. I had planned not to buy this set, but at 19.99, I couldn't pass it up. So, I purchased it to complete my Columbo collection. I have ordered Season Six. It has some of my favorite episodes on it. I can't wait for the sixth season to arrive in November."
3,Columbo Low,"I already had the first four seasons, so this was a must-have. Only two of the six episodes were five-star (A Case of Immunity and Now You See Him), and one was a muddled mess (Identity Crisis), earning one star. Not his best season, but the price was on par with other sites and the shipping was free. I look forward to Season Six and hope for better things."
5,I have the Set,"I have and love Seasons 1, 2, 3 & 4. Had to get 5 and watch the Great Columbo. Each episode is uncut just like when each was first aired. Nice to see him say again and again - Just one more thing!"
4,Another Great Columbo Season..,"Just like the previous four seasons, I enjoyed this season 5 collection. As other reviewers have said, the best episodes are ""Forgotten Lady"",starring Janet Leigh, ""Identity Crisis"" with guest actor and director Patrick McGoohan, and ""Now You See Him"", one of Jack Cassidy's last performances.""Last Salute To The Commodore"" is one of my least favorite Columbo episodes, not because it strayed from the usual formula but because of the weakness of the storyline and ending.One note for Columbo fans: In the episode ""A Matter Of Honor"" guest-starring RicardoMontalban, Columbo is first seen in the episode in the midst of a fender-bender. A policeman asks Columbo for identification. This is the only time in any Columbo that I've seen where you can CLEARLY see Columbo's ID...and his first name!(which I won't tell for those who would rather just think of him as Lieutenant)."
4,Good Collection,"This package of Columbo is as good as the previously released version. This is wonderful to enjoy Columbo at any time and a choice of shows. I cannot wait until the other shows are released. I am a Columbo fan, and this package and the others I have purchased have been GREAT!"
2,Not going to purchase,"I like other fans am very disappointed in the way Universal is packaging and selling the Columbo series. I initally bought every set as soon as they came out, but the 5th Season I am going to pass. The reason Columbo was so appealing was Peter Falk, so when is there going to be something from him on these sets? I do hope the next set is more worthwhile, otherwise I will have to pass again....."
2,"ANOTHER Set of ""Cut"" Episodes","This set was a gift. I was amazed at how cheaply this series is now being produced. No artwork on the DVD, no artwork on the inside of the cases. The worst of all is the fact that Universal markets these sets as ""complete & uncut"". They are not uncut. ""Last Salute to the Commodore"" is missing more than 10 minutes of footage. In the 1970s, commercial breaks did not run 25 minutes for a 2 hour program. That is common now, but not in the 70s. ""Commodore"" runs just over 95 minutes. In a 2 hour slot, that leaves 25 minutes for commercials. As I said, not in the 70s. The show is very jumpy because of the cuts. Each of these episodes is heavily cut up. If you don't mind chopped up episodes, and cheaply done packaging, this set is for you. Otherwise, look at the alternate sets being offered online by other providers. Universal deserves no one's loyalty. Universal is home of vast numbers of greed merchants."
3,"Good episodes, poor packaging","The episodes for the fifth season were as good as the previous Columbos, but the DVD does not give you individual menus for each episode with a synopsis, original airdate and breakdown of the scenes like there was on the other DVDs. I would rather see more extras and less of the ""bonus"" Mrs. Columbo episodes."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable.,"We Have thoroughly enjoyed ALL of the Columbo series, and look forward to reviewing them all again in about a year."
2,columbo the fifth season,"first two discs were fine third disc would not play movie if it did it would jump and stop therefore i did not see the third disc which had 2 episodes on it ,therefore i belive i got ripped off"
2,Not Up To Standards,"I own seasons 1 through 5. Seasons 1 through 4 are great (see my review for season one) But this....this is a lemon big time. Incomprehensible plots, bad acting. Boring. I had to go back 3 times to figure out why the Leslie Nielsen character was murdered and still couldn't figure it out. And why would an audience put up with a magician who takes 20 minutes to escape from an underwater tank? Why did Ricardo Montalban murder his trusted assistant, you don't find out until Columbo solves the case. And why was Colunbo wearing his rumpled outfit while vacationing in Mexico? I thought his clothes were a ruse to make the suspects lower their guards.Lousy writing, boring episodes, the writers ignored the formula which made Columbo so enjoyable. Skip season #5."
5,columbo rules,"I love watching columbo try and figure out who did it, that is half the fun of the series. I have collected all the seasons so far and cant wait for the next one to come out. It is as good as it was on the first season, kids your folks will love these as gifts and folks heck with the kids bought columbo and remeber a simplier time in life lol."
5,Loved it!,"Peter Falk is perfect in the role, but in the earlier episodes he tends to overdo the dumbfounded persona. He is more polished and natural in the later seasons."
3,missing songs,"This was a great album released in the mid 70's. Unfortunately, the CD release has different tracks than the original Canadian version. Tracks 1-6 are the same, 7-10 must be a European release. 'Living Next Door to Alice' is not found on the CD, which was on the original release, amongst others that are also great songs. I'd like to find the original version."
4,Montell's underrated album,"Montell Jordan's most famous for ""This Is How We Do It"" but he's put out a lot of great material in his career, now this ""More..."" album has a lot of great music on it but it gets overlooked. I really dig songs on here like ""I Like"", ""Falling"", ""What's On Tonight"", ""Never Alone"", and ""Bounce 2 This"", he did a great job here even though this ain't his best album, he deserves more props than what he gets, I'd like to see him make him a comeback again, this 2008 would be a great time to do so."
5,This and Let's Ride are the best albums period.,"More to Tell was definitely overlooked. So overlooked, I didn't realize I was singing his song in middle school. I thought it was someone else. I guess I thought he would come out w/ another ""This is how we do it"" album. He smoothed it out on this one. If u are on a long trip or just spend time w/ ur girl or guy - whatever the case may be - slide the CD in and let it play.""I like"" is the best song on there but ""fallin"" is a close second.P.S. If u can sing,fellas, sing ""What's on 2nite"",Trust me I know."
3,some interesting personal experiences,Some very interesting personal experiences. Some parts needed to be read & reread to understand useful information. not easy reading.
4,Underestimated band blows the audience away,"Unfortunately I didn't see this reunion show in Chicago. But happily, the one-off turned into a full tour and I got to see them in D.C.!Smoking Popes started out in Chicago as a poppy punk band. With each album their songs became more sophisticated, but they never lost their edge. The lyrics are intriguing and sometimes shockingly candid while the music rips and soars in all the right places.This was a momentous show for fans and it's only right it should be preserved in album for for posterity.My favorite songs here are: Paul, Need You Around, Pretty Pathetic, I Know You Love Me and Brand New Hairstyle."
4,Good Deal,Very good product-I can't see any difference between this and extra-strength Tylenol except the price. This is a good deal!
2,To like or dislike that is the question...,"On one level, I like this book. Ebert's witty and insightful reviews truly are enjoyable to read. I enjoy reading about films I know I'll never see.I also enjoy the added features, such as the Film Clip interviews, essays, and obituaries as appendices at the end of the book.On the other hand, I dislike the fact that many of the movies I want to read about are not in the book. I'm surprised at how many times I have turned to the book looking for a review only to come up empty handed. There can be nothing more disappointing. Granted, the book is thick enough as it is, but perhaps Roger could shorten his reviews and pack more into a volume."
2,Fails to serve its purpose,"When I say that Gene Siskel was the better critic (and writer), it's not just sentiment talking. How in the heck does one give **** to so many perfectly average movies (like ""L.A. Story"") as Ebert does in his book? The biggest fault with this annual collection is that it completely fails in its intention. Ebert seems to think of this as a more in-depth version of Leonard Maltin's guide but who needs to read a full-length review of a movie to determine if it's worth a rental or watching on the late show? A better idea for Ebert would be to just issue a complete volume of his work through the years instead of dumping the same reviews (with some additional material to make it ""new"") on the market year after year."
2,Does not fit,"I purchased this work bowl cover to replace a cracking work bowl cover on my current Cuisinart Food Processor. Unfortunately, it does not fit my existing base. The product description does not include sufficient information to determine which food processor model it belongs to. This may be the bowl for the Pro Custom 11(tm) Food Processor. I am ordering my new replacement direct from Cuisinart where the replacement parts are clearly listed for current models."
3,Found it cheaper elsewhere,"Don't get me wrong - I love the ease of finding and purchasing products from Amazon.com and I regularly shop here. But in this case I was able to find the DLC-877BGTX-1 - Cover with Large Feed Tube (Gray) for $19.95(plus 6.95 P&H;) at CuisinartWebstore.com. Ordered 11/24, arrived 11/27. Not too shabby.JF"
4,Abner Doubleday gives an inside account of Fort Sumter.,"Abner Doubleday presents a unique account from the Union side of the events leading up to and including the bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, which ignited the American Civil War. His first-person details from inside the garrison are hard to find elsewhere. He was such a staunch Unionist that he recalls being the only officer of the garrison in favor of the election of Lincoln. He continually protests against what he saw as the inaction of his own commanders and higher echelons. He felt that the Rebellion could have been nipped in the bud, had proper action been taken. From the foregoing, it should be apparent that sympathizers of the Confederacy will disagree with Doubleday on many points. I should point out that there is only limited evidence that Abner Doubleday had anything to do with the invention of baseball. He did, however, earn a Congressional Medal of Honor at Gettysburg."
4,Informative on a personal level,"This book was well written in a diary format and is an easy read. The insight into the daily life inside Fort Sumter and feelings of the people in Charleston during the days prior to the start of the Civil War was information that you do not find in school history books. The author, a union officer who was there, did a good job of trying to be objective in his writing. I would definitely recommend this book."
2,not a direct fit,"not enough clearance to mount without a little grinding near the lower shock eye, easy enough to do but a extra step in mounting"
3,Gyujtottam Gyertyat,"It is a very good matrix of traditional Hungarian music. Kamilla has a wonderful, upbeat voice, that lifts your spirit"
3,self-centred but interesting,"The author was priviledged to be taken on this governement exchange programme and it grated on me that he didn't take it seriously enough to study Japanese, as he was given the opportunity to do, or participate wholeheartedly in the activites at the school where he was teaching.The point of the exchange programme is very much cultural awareness and exchange, and it is funded by the Japanese government at least in part and I felt it should have got more bang for its bucks.However Nick's accounts of his aventures seem honest and are amusing and they sound as though he were writing to his friends (he probably was and turned it into an ebook, and well done)."
4,Enjoyable Read,"An enjoyable read! A young bucks rambunctious time as a JET in Omi Japan. Klar describes his journeys and adventures in a humorous and engaging way; from scavenging scrap piles for furnishing his flat, to his starring roles in office parties, to visiting waterfalls and temples. This book has a little bit of everything!If you enjoyed this book I would highly recommend:Under the Osakan Sun: A Funny, Intimate, Wonderful Account of Three Years in Japan"
5,I have been waiting for Quite a While for this Album.,I've heard some of the Song on this Album and fell in LoveWith Two Songs. I so Happy I finally got it.Feels great just listening to my C.D.
1,Don't waste your money,Cheap construction and comes wirh a motor not strong enough for the big noise it makes. Got broken in a couple of weeks. Don't buy from the manufacturer who allows this kind of junk wearing its name.
5,The Best Soundtrack for a TV Series,"Not much to say other than this rather avant-garde soundtrack for a period piece works wonderfully. This brassy, occasionally grosteque sound which Murray Gold brilliantly composed is enjoyable to listen to, but also complements the TV program very well. Its roots draw from jazz, Spanish folk, New Orleans funeral, Klezmer, classical and even Kurt Weil.Superb! I can't reccommend this strongly enough."
5,a gem,Such a fresh record. I discovered it by accident in a record store in Barcelona. Just bubbling with life and heart. You have to hear it.
4,Great direction for not-for-profits,"This book gives great insight into motivation, organization and function of a not-for-profit organization. The fundraising section lacks a thorough understanding of philanthropy and it's role in funding not-for-profits, however, the overall business approach to management can shift an organization to greater success."
3,Not all that special,"Whenever I purchase a book of this type, I expect to read facts that I didn't know. For me, this book was 50-50. I knew halfof the facts and did read a few interesting ones. For the most part, that which I didn't know, was not interesting. Sorry."
4,Amazing information!,"It totally amazes me that so much that makes up our lives originated in Philadelphia during the founding of our country. This was easy to read, short topical items well grouped together to make a coherent read. I found out things about Philadelphia and the surrounding area I never knew and have lived here for 60 years!"
4,Interesting little tidbits,"This was a fun read. Its full of interesting little tidbits about the history and culture of Philadelphia. Being one of my favorite places, I thought I knew a lot until I read this book and found out some real gems about the city. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about Philly, especially those planning to visit because it gives some great ideas for things to see and do there."
4,"wordy, but great book to learn from","I've never even heard of Photoshop Elements before this book. I downloaded the trial version, and gave it a whirl. Like many others, I have oodles of unused pictures that have been sitting on my computer for quite some time. As I was going through the book, I managed to learn how to do so many things with those pictures that I now print them out for display. I can't believe it: me, literally a beginner, doing things that I would never imagine, thanks to this book. Although the book was quite wordy, it has plenty of illustrations and screenshots to keep me on track.A quick recap of what I think of Photoshop Elements 3 for Windows One-on-OnePros:Easy to followShows many tricks that I would have never imaginedPlenty of illustrations, screenshots, and before/after photosTraining video of CDShows how to use the Organizer, a great plusCons:Alot of readingTraining video uses Quicktime, (but I'm just being picky)Overall: I definitely would recommend this book"
4,This product is exactly what I needed and wanted.,I am a quilter and will use this high quality light weight sewing machine for classes and group projects. This particular brand was recommended to me by several quilters.
4,Great sewing machine for my 12 year old daughter.,A great machine for the money. It takes some time to get started but once you have everything in place works great. Good for beginners too. My daughter loves it!
4,Janome Jem Golod 660 Lightweight sewing machine.,"I am a quilter and needed a new machine. It is simple to use and not complicated at all. Wish it had come with a carry case or bag. Am very happy with it,"
3,I can't use the needle threader. I can't use the zig zag stitch. It's a very nice manual but I can't follow it. HELP!,"I like the weight. The dial for the various stitches is very difficult to move. I've been sewing for 60 years, so i,m frustrated."
2,Janome Jem Gold was a waste of money.,The speed of this machine is way too fast and can not be slowed down enough for my sewing needs. I purchased this lightweight machine to take to sewing classes and now find it was a total waste of money.
5,Great Lightweight Machine for the Money,"Even though I am an experienced quilter and do most of my piecing at home on my Bernina, I dread taking it to classes and my quilt group because it is so heavy. I have two sets of stairs to carry it down to get to the car and recently have been asking my husband to carry it down for me. I can lift the Janome Jem Gold with one hand! It sews a very nice and accurate quarter inch seam. And it was only $189.00 with free shipping. I am the third person in my quilt group to purchase this machine and several more are expressing interest. If you aren't ready to invest in a Singer Featherweight then this is the machine to buy. The Janome Jem Gold is very simple to operate and could make a good first machine for a young person just learning to sew as well."
5,Janome Jem Gold 660,"I love IT!!! I needed a light weight machine to take back and forth to quilting classes and retreats. This is it. I bought the quilting packing and cover with it, and I am so good to go on traveling with my machine. I am planning on taking my machine with me when I go on vacation to visit family this summer, this way I can sew while they are at work. I was so please with this machine that I bought another one to keep sit up all the time in my sewing room."
4,Works Fine,"Gas cap light came on in wifes honda accord, so we picked up this one as a replacement. It fixed the warning light, but the leash does not fit around this one as it did the original."
4,A solid bargain MIDI keyboard.,"The Oxygen 49 by M-Audio is a great keyboard for the price. Plugs into my USB port on my laptop and interfaces well. It is lightweight, and has a large number of programmable knobs, sliders, and buttons to serve as MIDI controllers during recording sessions. The knobs, sliders, and buttons have a solid feel - although the 9 vertical sliders don't feel as nice as some other products out there.The keys are velocity sensitive (the harder you hit them, the louder the note) but are not weighted, so they feel light and cheap. However, this is the case with all keyboards that have non-weighted keys.Overall I recommend this product to anyone who wants a cheap MIDI keyboard that serves the basic functions. I wouldn't recommend it to serious musicians or composers, but it's good for hobbyists."
4,Worth the Price,"I give it 4 stars not because I think it is a great midi keyboard, but because I think it is one of the best keyboards in it's price. Well built, the knobs and sliders weren't as ""chintzy"" as I was expecting for this price range. Velocity sensitive touch is good and works well with Pro tools plugins. The Enigma controller program is very useful.Again, not the best out there, but certainly exceeds it's value."
2,It plays the notes... but that's all it does.,"I bought this keyboard to use with Garage Band. While it can adequately be used to sequence and play music, none of the dozens of knobs and buttons on this keyboard can be programmed for use with Garage Band. The only controllers that talk to GB are the pitch bend and modulation wheels. I was particularly disappointed to find that the sequence transport controllers do not work with the program. M-Audio has absolutely no information or support for Garage Band on their website or in the instruction manual.As for the keyboard itself, I wasn't expecting a Bosendorfer for 150 bucks, but the Oxygen 49's action is about the worst I've ever played, even on cheap USB keyboards."
5,Excellent Information - Very Comprehensive,"If you breed dogs once or many times, you need to have this book in your library. Our vet receommended we purchase it prior to our 10th litter. Even though we have many books on breeding, this by far is the best. It is no nonsense & very specific. I am very glad we purchased it."
2,fabtech not a kit,"blocks by themselves do not make a ""kit"". also 2 1/2"" wide blocks don't fit properly with 3"" wide springs, poor description and application"
3,Good Starting Point for learning about life in Ancient Egypt,"This is a good book for anyone interested in learning some facts about this fascinating civilisation, with topics rangings from Everyday life in Egypt, to Egyptian gods, to the discovery and excavation of tombs.I felt that the title and the blurb on the back were a little misleading, however, as they seemed to suggest that the book would attempt to discuss and solve more of the mysteries of Egypt (connection with Atlantis? who really built the pyramids? etc) and that the author would give the reader a few interesting theories to ponder. Instances of this were quite rare throughout the book. It was more a collection of basic facts than an attempt to uncover the fascinating secrets of ancient Egypt.An informative read nevertheless!!"
2,akk no,"This is absolutely NOT where you should start out listening to the Sonics. It contains only two cuts from their peak days: ""Psycho"" and ""The Witch,"" which were leased from Etiquette Records. Everything else here is from their tragic waning days, when they switched to the Jerden label, went out into the big world, got their sound cleaned up, lost their way and fell apart.It's very simple: Their great stuff was on Etiquette Records. Get the Norton reissues of their first two albums, ""Here are the Sonics"" and ""Boom,"" or the ACE compilation ""Psycho-Sonic"" (for stereo mixes).There are a couple other decent things here, but even the best pales against the other stuff."
5,Don't miss this one,"Don't be put off by the one negative review-- this is still the Sonics! It may not all be their best work, but it's still great stuff. A couple of the cuts are a little weak, but most, not to be found elsewhere, are fine. It is raw and powerful and far ahead of what other bands were doing at the time, and far better than most bands in the garage at any time. If you like the Sonics, this is a must have album, along with Here Are and Boom and the fascinating Norton collections."
3,"Nice, but no cigar","This is an enjoyable CD. Solid musical performances with a distinct southern back hills style, but it doesn't light my fire. Worth a listen, but doesn't stay in my CD player long. Cheers, pwb"
4,"Required to use your RPS, but expensive and short. Also needed for Cisco2960S","I'm using these short, heavy-duty cables to connect my Cisco RPS2300 to my new Cisco 2960S switches. The cables are as expected: a heavy-duty, proprietary design, looks like good quality, and you'll pay the premium price because you need it to use your RPS unit.They really could be a few feet longer. Even in a well designed telecom rack, these cables are on the short side for going top to bottom.Also note that contrary to the manual and description, the newest Cisco 2960S models (verified on ws-c2960s-24td & ws-c2960s-24ts) have the larger RPS connector like the 3750/3560 does, and thus require this cable. Older 2960 models use theRPS2300 Cable Other Than for Einstead."
5,Supurb support,"What I like about this book, is the support you get when you have bought the book. My teacher uses the CD-rom for presentations in our class, therefore making things visible. (Mainly because of the great animations, with a lot of detail) Even better is the support over the internet. In a few months we will talk with teachers from all over the world. The book has only one downside: it's prize. After all, I'm only a student...."
4,Mr,It is a very good service when it was delivered fast more than I expected.It is also a good price.I definitely recommend this seller to anybody I know.
3,expensive but much info,"This book has many chapters(55). The authors claim in the introduction that they dont expect everyone to read or study all the chapters in high school or college. The point is why did they put all the chapters in the book then? It goes beyond just reference folks. The chapters are too descriptive and the authors have a habit for speaking in first person, instead of just giving you the facts. The CD-ROM is helpfull and some of the interviews are good just to know. The website makes you put in all these codes just to review so thats worthless too."
2,too dense as a text,"I used this book in my intro to biology class, and the information was so dense that it read as more of an encylopedia than a text book. It was impossible to remember all of the minute details included in the chapters, and the main concepts were so hidden behind all the other information that it was difficult to pick them out."
2,Just a tea,"Well,just a tea. Taste is good.But you can buy the tea in the store for $2.99So, not worth it"
3,not what i was expecting,this isn't really what i was expecting. drank 4 cups and didn't feel anything. was thinking it would have the effects of green tea but didnt really do much.
3,no increase in energy whatsoever,"It is a good tea, but I have not felt any increase in energy whatsoever as promised. So I gave it 3 stars."
5,Ebert sees all the movies he reviews,"And reviews them from the point of view of someone who actually likes movies. He likes more movies than I do, but his reviews do give me enough to know if I want to see the film - and that is really what it's all about. I buy the current book every year.If you are worried about ""accuracy"" of his reviews - check out the big objections others have raised. Most people are aware there are more important things than obssessing over a minor detail from an F/X flick or the dialog in a 50 year old monster movie."
2,I've semi-often found Ebert's reviews a little inaccurate,"In this book when he reviews the film The Day After Tomorrow Ebert claims the character of Sam's mother (you'll understand this if you've seen TDAT) is in New York taking care of a sick hospital patient even though the city is now frozen under ice. Actually, Sam's mother is in another american city (not NYC) taking care of the kid. Some years ago I found the way Ebert reviewed another film (called In THe Dead of Winter) also to be a little inaccurate as well. I think he should watch all the films he puts into books at least half a dozen times before he puts them into book form. He seemingly only watches some of them once and it shows in his work."
3,Rear pads only lasted one and half year,"Bought this in Jan 2011, now the mechanic told me I need the rear pads replaced. The OEM lasted from 2004 (new) and I was never a hard-breaking driver not to mention the daily drive to work is less than 4 miles ;) . I am going back to OEM especially for the price."
5,A delightful surprise,"Looking the cover over I spied a few names I recognized... Hesperion XX/XXI?! Expecting something 'on the usual lines' of Hesperion, I was quite surprised, pleasantly so, to find that I had something very different. If I had to characterize the sound in one word: intimate. There is a pleasant mix of Moorish/Turko music combined with 'standard' European music to please most folks and to keep them interested. However, the sound remains subtle and intimate. A standard on my daily commute."
5,The Only One,"When I hurt my arm, I went to Target and got a strap. They do not work as they offer less support to the muscles. Out of desperation, I bought this product. It is the only one that really works. I have at least 6 other brands, and they are not effective."
2,No Customer Service,Not a good fit for my arm and not very comfortable. I emailed seller for a request to return. Never heard back from them.
5,For every situation,"I love this beautiful piece of art. It helped me so much in my everyday life. When I'm lovesick - I turn on 4'33"". I am of good cheer - 4'33"" takes me even on higher grounds. When I find myself in a car with a quarreling wife and complaining kids, all I need is this track and their whining gets drowned out quickly. On my last motto party ""Silence of the Lamb"" it intensified the atmosphere, making it quite spooky.I especially recommend this song for these music-addicted kids who can't live without music and walk around with earphones all day and night. Maybe it helps them to get a clear mind to start reflecting about the meaning of life and other important issues..."
4,awesome!,I have always loved this song. I have the piano and orchestral versions. I adapted it to air guitar and now I drive the neighbors nuts by jamming this tune almost every Saturday morning.
2,"Prefer ""A One Minute Silence""","True, 4'33"" was the original, but I think it was bested by Mike Batt's classic rock band The Planets with their song, ""A One Minute Silence."" It was truly wrong that John Cage's estate sued Batt back in 2002, and that Batt had to pay a six figure sum in the settlement. The pieces aren't even comparable. 4'33"" is overlong. Batt's AOMS hits harder because it give you the emotional feel in a compacted time. Was Batt inspired by Cage? Of course. But he took it to the next level.AOMS is available on Amazon. SeeA One Minute SilenceYou might want to get both for comparison, but if you only get one, go for ""A One Minute Silence."""
4,Soothing,"This is the most soothing mp3 I own. After a hard day, I put this on the stereo and relax. My only concern is that it's recorded at a higher level than most of my other music, so I have to turn it down when it comes on. That's why I only gave it 4 stars."
2,The bootleg of the original performance is still the best,"Even with the pops and hisses in the background on that first tape, nothing can compare to it. I was blown away listening on a friend's hi-fi and the feeling from that magnificence filling the rec-room... it just blew me away and forever changed my view of modern works. This recording, with all it's sterile, digital processing is a mere faint echo of that one"
4,"It's nice, but .....","I've had this track on vinyl for ages, and was pretty fired up when I saw that a digital version had come out. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed. Analog rules!"
1,wrong item sent,"i ordered a specific product for a specific vehicle, the part for sale was for my vehicle, however when i received the product, it was for another make of vehicle altogether, when i called amazon, they had no idea what to say, except to try and send it back before the 10 days alotted for a wrong product, i did not open the product before 4 or 5 days were already up, so, now i payed for and am stuck with something that was falsly advertised! i will not order through amazon again, and i have let others know that i received no help what-so-ever!"
2,Not A Balanced Collection,"The majority of tracks here come from Soccio's New Wavey, electronic 80's work rather than the clean, spare, original, and well constructed 70's numbers."
2,"Series is good, but the dubbing s**ks","Tenchi Muyo is acclaimed and praised my many anime fans. Well,I just don't think the English version does it any justice. Plus, theepisodes on this tape give the series a boring start.. get the Japanese version."
5,The FIRST Tenchi episode is by far one of the greatest,"Greetings, veteran Tenchi fan here.This is the episode that started off the Tenchi phenomena, and it is easy to tell why it became so popular. In fact, I was never a fan of anime in the least until I borrowed this video from a friend about 2 years ago. Since then, I have been collecting all Tenchi paraphenalia, and have pretty much married the series. If you can't afford the series, then don't watch, because you WILL get hooked!"
5,An introduction to a NOT TO BE MISSED anime!,"Tenchi Muyo is a classic in my eyes. Almost every anime fan I know has seen it and I've yet to hear any negative comments. With it's two seasons that involve the character's hilarious connections, interactions, and conflicts, it's twenty times better than Tenchi Universe. I actually watched Universe first but when I got my hands on this I was amazed at hwo far Tenchi could go. The show is filled with comedy, action, and drama. By the way, definently watch the movies. ;)"
5,Cusinart Replacement Bowl,"This is the fourth replacement bowl for my nearly 30-year old Cuisinart. The fit was perfect, both to the Cuisnart base and the lid."
2,Does not fit,"I purchased this work bowl to replace a cracking work bowl on my current Cuisinart Food Processor. Unfortunately, it does not fit my existing base. The product description does not include sufficient information to determine which food processor model it belongs to. This may be the bowl for the Pro Custom 11(tm) Food Processor. I am ordering my new replacement direct from Cuisinart where the replacement parts are clearly listed for current models."
5,Cuisinart Replacement Bowl,By 40 year old bowl cracked and this one works perfectly. It was a little tight at first but it's fine now. Did not wish to purchase an entire new Cuisinart.
1,REVIEW,"LOCKING HOLES (ON SIDES OF BOWL ) ARE IN THE WRONG PLACE EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXACT REPLACEMENT. I USED A FILE AND GOT THE BOWL TO LOCK PROPERLY. BUT, THIS SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AS A REPLACEMENT."
2,Beautiful pictures,"Beautiful published book, nice photo's, but sadly you don't get to know Frank Parker. Lots of stats and scores, but what Parker thought and believed you don't get to know. The book gives a little insight in tennis of that particular era, but Frank Parker didn't came alive for me. As if research was done only from behind the desk en writer didn't talk to contemporariesor relatives."
1,Ordering from Amazon has been a disappointment to me!,I have never recieved this product that I ordered as well as a few others. I will never order from this place again!!!
4,tota ly fly,"i bought this toy for my daughter janay. shes a big bratz fan. she has collected 38 bratz dolls so far. she has the new girls night out bratz too all of them. she has every new sunskiss except cloe shes never in the store. she thinks there skin color is so pretty and their face. the only thing is weird is their fake foot it doesnt even have toys. they look like paddles. have to be careful their braclets are so small they don't stay on their hands unless you tie it tight with rubberband. a child under 6 should be careful small pieces choke off. they,ll have fun playing with thes in the summer. i;m still waiting for the sunkiss pool they said was gonna come out too.enjoy love alethea p.s. they should make a big bratz townhouse or mansion for the summer with waterfall inside that works and ceiling fan and doorbell that rings and lights turn on .also make easter bratz with pretty dresses with a basket."
5,The greatest marketing book EVER!!!,"I was in Ken Kaser's marketing class for two years and i can honestly say with utmost certainty that Mr. Kaser's sports marketing book is the greatest, most compelling story of human drama and intrigue that i have ever read. It is a poignant and touching journey into the human psyche and inded the very nature of man. Through his stunning portrayal of the book's main character (a Jewish man named Trey), Kaser delves into the relms of intelectual enlightenment and human sexuality. While many subjects are explored through the main character's search for the meaning of life, he ultimately confronts the eternal questions of existence such as ""Why am i here?"", and ""Why is Tenney such a bastard?"". This book is a life changing epic full of all the things that make great literature great. Ken Kaser has given the world a gift it will appreciate forever and he will go down in history as the greatest writer in the English language. I give it 5 stars."
5,Rockford Files - Season Two,I loved James Garner in the Rockford Files. It is a classic and I would recommend it to everyone.
5,olddad,I am very satisfied with the Rockford Files and the fast delivery.If you are a James Garner fan like me you will really enjoy this dvd.
5,Rockford Files--Second Season,"I totally enjoyed this show in the 1970's when it originally came out. James Rockford is a totally believable character that works hard, but somehow always misses the pot of gold (money) at the end of the rainbow. He's sarcastic and a guy who bases his actions on real life--not a bunch of rigid rules. The relationship between he and this father is so special, yet believable."
4,The Rockford Files,"I remember Rockford as a child, my Dad and I looked forward to watching it every week.Now my son and I have been enjoying Rockford... Awesome..."
5,Can't Get Enough of James Garner/Rockford,"James Garner is probably the hardest working televisionactor of them all. My favorite shows are Columbo, Mission: Impossible and the Rockford Files, but as an actor, Garner outclasses them all. As good as Columbo is, Peter Falk is puts in uneven performances. In Mission:Impossible, the focus continually shifts from one character to another, so no oneactor is on the spot all the time. In ""Rockford Files"", the story revolves around Jim so he is on screen much of the time,yet he NEVER puts in a bad performance, in spite of what musthave been an exhausting schedule, putting out a new show week after week. Of course, the outstanding writing and directing add to the charm of the program. I was in college in Southern California while the show was being produced so I can attest to how well the show reflected the slightly wacky society of the time and in the various odd types of people Jim encounters."
4,"The Rockford Files, Season 2","James Garner absolutely shone in this role. Twenty-two episodes here prove why he is considered one of this country's greatest actors. Garner could do it all; romantic leading man, tough guy, western hero & his comedic abilities were, perhaps, his strongest area.This series was practically tailor made for Garner being, essentially, an update of the Maverick character he had portrayed fifteen years earlier. When Stephen Cannell pitched this series to Roy Huggins (creator of Maverick & The Fugitive), Huggins told him the same thing: This is Maverick updated! Get Jim Garner to play the role.Bonus features include the original Rockford Files pilot which ran as a Movie of the Week. It's about 72 minutes long & full of vintage Rockford, There are some subtle differences from the subsequent series, the most notable being another actor portraying his father. Also included is a short interview with Cannell discussing the creation of The Rockford Files."
5,Best Deal out there,"Bring out season 3!!! This is a great deal. For the price, you get 6 DVDs and about 25 hours of one of the best shows of all time. I love Rockford in that the more you watch it, the more you want to watch it. It really grows on you.James Garner is the best"
5,Stila Jade Blossom Spray,This item was purchased as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. It is her fragrance of choice and it smells so very nice on her -- soft delicate -- just a hint of floral.
5,Classic Movies with Ray Harryhausen,"For me, these movies are a joy to watch. They're not for everybody to be sure but to one who was a child prior to all the newest special effects, these flicks were the epitome of entertainment for SciFi buffs. So I not only get to enjoy a good movie, but I also get to relive good memories."
3,As a young Pirate,"I remember these movies as a young boy. I would pretend to travel with Sinbad to exotic lands, bravely fighting monsters and getting Gold and other treasures. <Grinn> I'd let Sinbad have the girls but the other pirates and I would fight the British, Spain and other countries for the glory of Sinbad. Even though the claymation is a bit hokey by today standards, it was nice to journey to the past once again."
5,The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen - Legendary Monster Series (Jason and the Argonauts / The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad / The,Great item for a gift. Comes in a cool box. Very happy with this product
5,FANTABULOUS,"These are the films that set the standards for all special effects movies to come after them, specially the fantastic ""Jason and the Argonauts"", which is one of my all-time favorite movies. And who didn't like the Sinbad movies ... not me ... I LOVED THEM ALL, AND STILL DO!"
4,"Great kids films, though as a bundle there is a dud","Overall, these are really fun films: excellent older effects, good plots, timeless themes. I particularly liked Jason, but Gulliver is very good as well, cherished memories from my viewing days as a child. Of the Sinbad films, one Eye of the Tiger is bad (lousy acting, poorly directed, etc.) but the otehr two are great.Recommended. This is a good deal and my kids loved watching with me."
5,fantastic films,I was browsing dvd's and came across this collection. I had always enjoyed watching the Sinbad and Jason films years ago so I decided to buy this collection and watch them again. I must say that I am very happy with this purchase - the films are still exciting to watch and my grandaughter can't watch them often enough. She really enjoys the cyclop scenes. Definitely a good package!
1,incredible waste of money,"After having watched all the movies in the set, beginning to end, I sincerely wonder if the other reviewers are talking about the same films. It's not an issue of cinematography, or even the crude sets. The first few moments of trademark animation are interesting, but barely so. The scripts, staging, and most of the acting are remarkably poor for a major release.For all of the magic in the plotlines, the only real miracle is performed by Tom Baker as he somehow manages to keep at least one movie corpse from rotting away altogether.Here's a suggestion to Amazon: Please consider a requiring reviewers to declare if they have, or had, any financial interest in the product reviewed.Buyer beware: take the time to borrow or rent at least one before you consider buying the set."
5,Will capture your imagination.,"Ray Harryhausen truly is a master, and a genius, whose imagination, to me, can't be equaled. These movies will capture your imagination, and stay with you, 'til the end of time..."
5,"The Best Kept Secret In My 1,683 CD Collection","At first I thought this would be one of those one single hit groups. The video convinced me to buy the CD; I'm not into singles. I would listen to the CD on and off, never really taking the time to listen closely, until one day. I sat in my favorite music listening chair, pop on the CD, as I waited for my lady to come over. I was in the mood for something different, and this CD set it off for me. As I got into this CD I discovered that this CD was Da Bomb!. This CD had some great bass lines, and the lyrics were straight from a playas mind. I was surpised to see that this CD was produced by Jay-Z's record company(Rockafella). Jay-Z current CD is the up tempo version of this CD. To sum this up the Chistion CD is a smooth slow jam money making ghetto grind CD. If you're a real Gee or a Hardcore Playa and you are sitting the mood to get your mack on, then this is the CD for you."
4,This album is great.But it takes like 3 times to feel it.,"This album is great overall but there are certain glitches,ecspecially in the love chapter where a couple of the songs were lacking in quality."
4,A Mixture of 70's and new 90's soul.......,"This is a really good CD. It's different from most music we hear now a days. I love how Christion separates their album into different chapters because it helps the flow of the music. However, I think that their first chapter (The Streets) is the best. I love all of the songs in this chapter, esp. ""Full of Smoke"" and ""The Ghetto"". The ""Love"" and ""Relationship"" chapters are okay, not really great, but not really bad. ""I Want to Get Next to You"" and ""Bring Back Your Love"" are the best songs of the ""Love""chapters. The last chapter, ""The Aftermath"" is a nice ending. The Songs are very original and totally different from the rest of the album; very unique. Over all, I really liked this CD. I just feel that Christion could have done better without all the ""sappy, love"" songs----(with the exception of ""I Want to Get Next to You"" and ""Bring Back Your Love"" of course). But check this CD out, there are some really great cuts!"
5,Love'n it!,"I LOVE this CD (I actually have the tape) I keep it in my car and play it on my way to college. Wooooooo Weeeee...is all I can say about this one. Its smooth, relaxing, and it tells the truth about grow'n up in the ghetto. ..."
1,DIDNT GET ALL THE SONG...,I had this CD but it was damaged and amazon was the only place I found this album but after several attempts I'm still unable to get my favorite track.
3,Once Again It's On!,"Christión is back with Project Plato, released September '05. If you're a real fan you'll get it!"
5,Just Perfect !,"This album is straight out just perfect,im used to give criticismbut not this time !Cant wait for their next cd to drop.Fo real if you like R&B; these guys are the best !"
4,No problems whatsoever,"I don't understand everyone's problems with this printer. I've been using this printer for over two months for my home business, and I've yet to encounter any problems. I do a lot of printing, (I've already replaced both the color and black ink cartridges at least once,) and the cartridges last through many, many pages. I don't even have the paper jams everyone keeps mentioning about Lexmark printers. This is my second Lexmark and I'll probably buy a third whenever mine needs replacing. I have no problems with the software, no problems with the printer. Maybe these paper jams have to do with the quality of paper being fed through them? Plus, I can print out my digital pictures and they aren't super grainy like some printers are with photos. This printer isn't the same caliber as those photo printers, by any means, but it does serve a purpose for printing photos once in awhile. I recommend this printer."
4,Dell Computers did their homework regarding this printer.,"I got this printer with my new Dell Desktop 4550. They included it with the package and knowing Dell they did the homework on the machine prior to making it the printer of choice.It is good for the money. Fast for an inexpensive printer and the color is solid and good.The paper feed is simple and doesn't jam, Yeah! The printer is quiet in comparison with the old HP that it replaced.If I had one gripe, it is regarding the default properties on the printer setting. The setting is locked on ""normal print"" (using more ink) and each time I want ""quick print"" (faster, less ink) I have to go in and reset the printer settingsOther than that I would recommend this unit and, for the price, it is a very good printer."
1,Lexmark Z35 Inkjet Printer,I had this printer in 2002 because it came free with my eMachines T1742 desktop computer from Best buy it worked for a while but the paper kept going in crooked and jamming then after a while it would not shut off by pressing the power button had to unplug the cord from the outlet just to shut it off then went to change the ink i noticed a piece of plastic from the inside of the printer that had been melted laying inside it also went through ink like crazy never again will i buy Lexmark.Do I Recommend This Product? Heck No
1,Floating boat anchor,This product is a total piece of junk. Lexmark should be embarrassed to put this product on the market. The paper feed is always pulling the paper to the side so it jams constantly unless you physically walk over and hold the paper aligned properly and it sucks ink faster than New York skid row bum sucks thunderbird wine. It's as worthless as a floating boat anchor. I wish Amazon had a zero star rating.
1,Very bad experience,"I got a brand new Lexmark Z35 a couple of weeks ago. This is my first printer. I am astonished by its bad performance. The print speed is so slow, almost 1 minute to print a single page. The black toner seems does not work, it can not print any black signs or letters on paper."
2,Puppy Not Interested,"Unfortunately, our new puppy could care less about it. We had hoped it would help with crate training, but our puppy just stepped on it and cried!"
5,He takes it everywhere with him,"From the first night home, our puppy has loved his Snuggle Puppy! He immediately snuggled up to it his first night and, even though he does still have to get up once or twice to go outside, he happily returns to his crate right away, back to his Snuggle Puppy. I truly believe this product is a godsend to new puppies and their puppy-parents.During the day, he'll drag his Snuggle Puppy out to wherever he's playing or sleeping and keep it close. The Snuggle Puppy is almost bigger than he is, but he manages to drag it anywhere he wants to go. He loves his Snuggle Puppy!"
3,Heart-beat doesn't last very long but great product,"I love this product in concept and when you put a fresh set of batteries in, but if you forget to turn off the heartbeat even once, it is pretty much dead within a few days. The battery that is used is pretty expensive (about $8 for two).But, with that said, my puppy LOVES this thing and it really does work as advertised.The customer service at this company is also very amazing. My first heart died and wouldn't start back up even with new batteries and they quickly replaced it."
3,Would have given 5 stars but...,"My great dane puppy loved his snuggle puppy, and I say loved because the snuggle puppy(SP) is now dead. We always left his SP in his crate with him, even if it did not have the heartbeat on, or the heating element he would lay on this thing as a pillow. It gave him comfort. Well he got sick in his kennel last night, and it got on SP so I took out the heating pouch and the heartbeat heart and proceeded to wash it in cold water on the gentle cycle. When I went to get it out to put in the dryer, OMGosh there was the insides of SP all over the inside of the washing machine. Now this being a product for puppies, you'd think it would be made so it would be able to be washed. My poor baby does not have his friend anymore :( The liner came loose and all of the stuffing came out, poorly made interior."
3,Good product - needs to be more durable,The snuggle puppy seems to help calm my dog down but it doesn't seem too durable. I've had to repair holes in several times.
3,brown mutt dead heart snuggle puppy,"I purchased this for my 8week old yorkie,hoping to comfort her in the night.When I recieved it the batteries were old and corroded...DEAD.Iput in freezer for a while and scrubbed them clean (batteries).Worked for about 1 week,puppy loved it.Now she just sleeps with it,no heartbeat.Hard to find batteries in stores and shipping costs more than batteries.So,my review is nice thought,but purchase extra batteries at same time."
5,A Puppy's Best Friend,My puppy loves his Snuggle Puppy. He sleeps with it at night and plays with it during the day. This has been the best purchase for my puppy. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and am so glad I did!
5,The Best in the Series!,"This is the first book I've never been able to put down. I finished it within about four hours. I've never been more into a book then this one... I can't rave enough about this book. It's my favorite in the series and all I can hope is that you'll read it! I mean if you like mystery,vampires, murders, and yeah some romance...this is the book for you!"
4,Ghostbuster vs Vampire,"In a series that reads like a cross between Fearless and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it is not surprising to get a tale where the subject of vampire actually arises. Suze Simon, mediator to the dead, is confronted by a screaming ghost in her room one night. Suze needs to get a message to ""Red"" in order to satisfy the screaming specter.But delivering messages for the dead is not usually an easy task. Recipients may not believe you or they may think you are crazy. But this time Suze runs into someone who may be crazy and very dangerous. This time she might be in over her head.Once again we get a fast-paced story as Suze tries to balance her unwanted role of mediator with her life as a teenager. Add a possible new boyfriend, her new family, and a case of poison oak and Suze really has her hands full even without being a mediator. But Suze manages to weather it all in her own way, and sometimes with a little help. Another fun book."
4,"The ninthe key, the mediator series","I liked Jenny Carroll's book the ninth key because it kept me glued to the pages the whole time. The plot is good and there is enough suspense that it keept me wanting to finish it throughout the book. Anyway, I would definately reccomend this book to anyone who likes a short, suspenseful novella."
4,"good, just not as good as the first","In the second book of The Mediator series, the ghost of a woman asks Suze to find ""Red"" and tell him her death wasn't his fault. Suze has her work cut out for her when she discovers that ""Red"" is really eccentric millionaire Thaddeus Beaumont, and all signs point to his being a murder. Suze also has a new love interest, Tad, who just happens to be Mr. Beaumont's son.This book was pretty good but a few things did get on my nerves. Suze's constant complaining that Tad was the only boy to ever ask her out was really annoying because two boys asked her out in the first book. Also, in the beginning, the book kept skipping around in time which was really awkward. Other than those minor complaints I really enjoyed the second book in the series, but not quite as much as the first."
5,Great Book,"Finally Susannah Simon is able to get to sleep but is suddenly woken up by a screaming ghost. Not only that, she finds out that the guy she is interested in is related to a killer. Will she be able to save herself before it's too late?This is an excellent sequel to Shadowland, I recommend this book to everyone."
5,Essential tool for installing composite decking,"I purchased 3 of these tools to install composite decking and found them to be essential in providing accurate spacing. I am using 20 foot deck boards and there is a fair amount of warping and bending in any board that long. Without the Johnson tool, I would have gone crazy trying to place 16 penny nails or sighting the spacing.The holes are great for screw spacing, as well.I have also just used the tools to space ceramic tile for the medallion on my deck. They worked great for that purpose, as well.I have just ordered 3 more tools to make the remainder of the decking installation go faster."
4,Really nice watch,I bought this watch as a christmas gift so it hasn't been used yet. It looks very nice and feels lightweight. The box it comes in is a black recliner. Cute idea!
1,don't buy old batteries,"Lithium Ion battery life-span decreases from the date they are manufactured, not when you start using them (it's true, look it up on Wikipedia). I bought this battery about 10 months ago, and it's already dead and doesn't hold a charge. Nonetheless, I might buy another one, rather than pay $100-$200 for a new phone...."
5,Perfect,"One of those rare perfect albums (imho). Not a dud or filler song on it. She must have caught it at just the right time. Sincere, heartfelt, achingly-beautiful singing. And catchy to boot."
3,Life is too short for Eurotrash,"Excellent picture, very good sound, fine conducting, excellent singers. Minimalist, cartoonish sets with goofy and needlessly kinetic stage action which undercuts any dramatic impact. About 20 minutes into this I thought about what time is worth to a middle aged man and concluded that I come out ahead by writing off the purchase price of this DVD; so I went to listen to a Haydn symphony instead. Now that you know I didn't watch most of this, you can fairly judge how useful or useless this review is to you."
1,One of the worst opera productions I've ever seen!,"This has to be one of the worst opera productions I've ever seen. The staging and costumes were incoherent and silly. Nothing about this production makes any sense. Why are there ""wild men"" with long, shaggy hair wearing tutus dancing in the background? I love to laugh and I'm easy to please, but this stuff is just NOT funny. The story line is simple and the music is okay, perhaps divorced from this ridiculous production it might have been somewhat entertaining. The only good thing I can say about it is that Marlis Peterson sang well. Watching, I thought all the singers must be wishing they were not in this farce. A couple minutes into Act 2, I turned it off. I advise you to skip it unless you are a Haydn freak. Actually, if you are a Haydn freak, you should skip this too, as it will make you sick."
3,Companion is Worthless by Itself,"When they said ""Companion,"" they didn't mean Companion for Sendmail version 8.13; they ment Companion for ""Sendmail, 3rd edition."" This book only covers the updates between 8.12 and 8.13. If you don't know what 8.12 does in the first place, you need to get ""Sendmail, 3rd edition"" in addition to this one. Other than that, it's a great book."
4,Fighting spam,"This slim book documents the latest major release of sendmail. It assumes that you are already well familiar with running an earlier sendmail. The author does not waste your time going over generic properties of sendmail that have been true for years.The book can be easily summarised as fighting spam. The key changes in 8.13 revolve around this topic. A tribute to the scourge that spam has become.Perhaps the biggest change has been the enhancements to Milter, which allows filter plugins that are written by third parties (you?), often in C. Then when sendmail gets a message, it applies these filters (there can be several). By this means, you can incorporate any particular antispam methods to the mail. Earlier sendmail versions had Milter. But 8.13 has vastly expanded the scope."
3,"Good idea, but falls little short.","Pros:-Data displayed are relatively accurate.-Ease of transfer of data from device to PC.-Simple to useCon (a big one):-Device itself is not heavy, but the weight and the balance of the club are changed dramatically when you attach the device. It was hard for me to make my normal swing, because it didn't feel right with the extra weight on the upper part of the shaft. If you want to use it, you'll just have to deal with this problem, because I certainly couldn't get used to it."
2,Developmental Neuropsychology,This book is very hard to read. It is very technical. It was a very dry book. Very boring. The only reason that I bought this book is that I needed it for my class at college. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they need it for a class or are really into this subject.
4,A quality overview of every book of the Old Testament,"If you want to have a conservative viewpoint on individual book of the Bible. This is one of the best suggestion for an introductory survey. It provides basic information on authorship, date, occasion, purpose of the book. It has a simplified outline to help you to have a grasp of the flow of the book. However, Dr. Charles Dyer and Dr. Eugene Merrill are both well accomplished evangelical scholars. Their brief comment do not mean naive in understanding but for the benefit of lay people. I highly recommend this book for serious Bible students, group leaders, and Sunday school teachers.However, there is one sad news on current price.Those who sell these books are greedy people. Don't buy from those who set such a high price."
1,description sucks,"no description on how tiny the frogs were, I was highly disappointed. I will use them but not for the reason I ordered them for and the price was outragious for such tiny frogs. this is why I grow to detest amazon."
5,Great for the Power Ranger fan,"My son got the yellow flame cycle for Christmas and had to have the red one as well. I agree with the other reviewer in that the ""flame"" pieces do tend to fall off now and then. They do not affect the play of the toy and my son never seems to care if they are on or not. It is very durable and his withheld some serious play time. He loves how the front part of the cycle ""shoots"" off to help defeat some bad guys...... A great addition to any little boy's Power Ranger collection."
4,just what my boy wanted,"It's exactly what he wanted, the pieces keep falling off but go right back on."
5,papa's got a brand new bag,this is such a great bag. I got two of them and plan to get more. the material and workmanship is fantastic
3,Good comic book stuff,"While Ben Bova's premise and plot is interesting enough in its own right that I actually finished this book (Moonwar), it was not a satisfying reading experience. The characters were very flat and predictable good guy/bad guy stock characters from the movie seriel and melodrama traditions. The only almost complex character was Bam, the good hearted assassin, and even here the plot falters trying to make sense of his place in the story. When Doug tells him, in essence, 'sure you cut my thoat and tried to kill me, but I sense that we could be friends', the reader wants to say 'WHAT?'. It makes one wonder about the hero's grip on things. And the dialoge generally is laughable. One could imagine these lines in an old Flash Gordon film. Over the top with a straight face. I found it hard to take."
3,Not a compelling read. Bova can do better.,"I am a big fan of Bova's work. However, this book was easy to put down.It never grabs the reader. The story is okay, but not great. It's pleasant enough. One complaint is that there are too many characters to keep track of, many in a walk-on appearance. Bova can do better."
2,Space soap opera at its worst,"I am astonished that anyone could give this 5 stars! Come on guys; are you really classing this politically-correct, stereotypical pot-boiler up there with Dune, 2001, Consider Phlebas etc? Moonwar has a very strong ""made-for-TV"" feel to it and amounts to little more than Dallas or Dynasty in space. The undemanding little yarn may keep you mildly interested for a few hours, but where's the depth or the meaning? I'm afraid I cannot recommend Moonwar, because I truely believe Sci-fi should be more visionary than this."
2,A Poorly-Written Flop,"A dreary, emasculated shadow of Heinlein's classic work, rendered even sadder by its occasional sly references.Bova's story is, of course, more probable, but his workmanlike writing fails to excite or convince. Read ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" if you're looking for a story worth caring about."
3,"Tastes great, less filling","Serialized science fiction bothers me. By trimming the fat from ""Moonrise"" and ""Moonwar"", Bova could have given us one really good book instead of two pretty good books. This sequal to ""Moonrise"" deals with the nations of Earth banning nanotechnology and trying to impose that ban upon the moon by force. A ban which would make it impossible for the moonbase colony to survive. This book has a much faster pace and was more entertaining than ""Moonrise,"" but was less satisfying overall. ""Moonrise"" was more drama while ""Moonwar"" is all action."
4,a pleasant read,Simply said: its enjoyable bedtime reading. The author presents interesting ideas and believable concepts without delving too much into _boring_ detail.
4,Great book for those interested in apologetics!,You will get the most out of this book if you have some background in apologetics and philosophy in general.
3,This is a heavy read...,"Unless you have formal training in philosophy or Christian Theology, I would stay away from this one. The book is well written and the research is rigorous. However, without some previous exposure to apologetics you will have difficulty understanding the material."
2,I feel like I had to slow my brain down while reading this book.,"I suppose this is a more enjoyable way to learn about plant management than a textbook to some people, but for me (and most people with a somewhat logical brain) it was excruciating. The plant manager takes ten chapters to understand the concept of what a bottleneck is. And he does so by being advices by an irritating physics professor that thinks he's beig clever by speaking through questions. If you are a plant manager and you don't understand what a bottleneck is then you should probably find another job. Instead the character in the book gets a promotion. I literally felt like I had to slow my brain down to read this. I think I need to do some Mensa problems now to exercise it back to normal. And if you are thinking that all that reading and waiting will be worth it for some great epiphany at the end...you will be sorely disappointed. I gave it two stars because maybe this book would be ok for high school or younger."
2,Too old book,I bought this book because it is necessary for my Operation class. But I do not like to read the old story took place over 20 years ago.
4,Good book... good theories,"Good book in general, but personally it was a textbook for our class..I realize it's not just a course requirement and that some business people may actually want to read this book. it does give some interesting perspectives and I would recomment it for someone who's interested in the material. Not real entertaining, but does give you soem unique perspectives on business processes."
5,Good story and logical process,"I would recommend this book to most people in business school and to any business owners involved in manufacturing. For the business owners, I think that after reading it, you will strongly recommend that your employees read it."
5,Getting the blinkers off !!,Got my attention from the very first page.Anyone involved in manufacturing will identify with the characters and storyline. I was amazed how easily my thinking could change after working more than 20 years in operations. Problems and solutions become more obvious. We are already applying some of Goldratt's logic with fantastic results not just on cost savings but with staff morale as well.Surprised myself with a whole new way of thinking..contrary to what seemed to be the most efficient way of doing things.
4,College Student,"I was required to get this book for an operations management course in college. It was definitely an enjoyable read, especially for a business book. The narrative format made for a very easy read. The real world examples offered make the connection between theory and application. We were given this book in place of a textbook, and it was about a million times more entertaining than any textbook."
5,Remove that Herbie!,"I love this book, once you read it you will never see manufacturing or business in the same light. A must read for all people in business. I had all my employees read it."
4,The Goal review for Lean and Sigma,This book is a very infomative and clear written book. Although it is not a breathe taking novel it is as best written as a text book could be written. Many senerios I found very helpful relating to my own real life experiences in the workplace and the challanges we meet everyday. Definitley well recommended. BUY IT...
4,Good read!,Goldratt does a nice job of weaving a compelling narrative around a concept as esoteric as supply chain constraints theory. Well worth the read for any student of why and how complex systems work (or fail to!)
5,The best novel I have ever read,"Fantastic. Would recommend very highly. If you read nothing else, don't miss this one. Especially good for managers. Well presented."
5,Great Book,"This was a required book in one of my classes, and unlike other school books, this was actually a novel and was very interesting. I read right through it, very easy read!"
4,Good place to start,"I read this book as part of required readings from my Supply Chain school. While this might not be the best business book ever, it is written is such a way that is easy and entertaining to read. Basically, you will learn a new approach on how to run a business ( a manufacturing plant in this case) and to identify more useful and reliable indexes to measure efficiency and productivity."
3,"Am I reading a bad soap opera or a managment book, either way it's too long.","OK, a good simple way to get across the basic ideas of process improvement, and easy to read.But half way through I got quite tired of his simplistic fictional story telling style. I wonder how much shorter the book could have been if he wrote it as a real management book. And then it could also be used as a reference. Now all I remember is something about how you get a bunch of boy scouts to march at a medium pace.I suppose if you like these kinds of books like ""ZAP!"" that try to use metaphors to beat a few points to death this book is for you. The author could boil this down by 75% by just adding a few charts or something.Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC"
5,Easy to deal with,"I purchased this book, and the order never made it to me. When I emailed the seller, they were extremely friendly and helpful. They offered to refund my money, and it wasn't a hassle at all. Really easy people to deal with."
3,Interesting read showing mangagement principles,"The book I received seems to have a little water damage which I was unaware of before. Besides that, the book is in decent condition with only a few highlighted marks in the important sections."
2,Smoke and Mirrors,"Upon recommendation I purchased all 3 in the series. While the tale is great and quite a page turner, I came away with a feeling that the books are a sales tool promoting the expensive courses rather than a source of practical information. An appealing looking but meatless sandwich."
4,Paradigm Shift,"As an HR professional, this book opened up a new world of operations. This no nonsense, straightforward book nicely balances theory and application.After reading this book, it's hard not to look at everything in terms of constraints (and that is a very good thing!)Highly recommended for somebody wanting to gain more skills to contribute to a firm's strategy."
4,Better than I expected,"This was required reading for a business class I took. While this is not a book I would likely have chosen to read on my own, I was pleasantly surprised. Especially compared to a traditional textbook it was pleasure to read - fast-paced and engaging, but still full of useful information.It wouldn't necessarily stand on its own as a piece of fine literature, but that wasn't the intention. If you're interested in learning about the theory of constraints (which applies to many aspects of life beyond business), then I highly recommend reading The Goal. I wish there were more books like this out there to use in my other classes!"
3,Good read for school,"I had to purchase this book to read for a business class at school. It was interesting, but not my favorite type of book."
2,I bought a business book and a Novel broke out,"For the person that prefers novels to business books this is probably a great resource for learning. As an avid reader of business books, it was hard for me to get through. After listening to, I couldn't read it, I went back to skim read it and try to understand the details to the Theory of Constraints. I guess that's my next read because based upon the raves, there is something I'm missing in the way the story is told."
4,Great introduction to the theory of constraints,"This book explains the theory of constraints and lets you identify bottlenecks in processes. Also consider ""Critical Chain"" as a level two book to read after understanding the fundamentals. Apply knowledge to management of projects and people as well, not just production."
5,Louis Fabricio Bermeo - IME 415 For Dr. Phil Rosenkrantz,"The Goal by Goldratt is a good read. I tried to read Deming in the past and even though he is a management genius his book put me to sleep at times, but the Goal was great! Half soap opera and half management, it held my interest while delivering the goods. Bottlenecks, excess inventories, and a management that wont shut up about ""efficiency"" reports make Mr. Rogo's life hell. In the end common sense and Industrial Engineering techniques prevail and Alex, along with his staff, learn to depend on themselves for solutions. They become their own guru's and no physicist is needed. So it is a great book that any management bound/engineering individual must read. I will finish off with a beloved quote from the book, "" Do not let common practice replace common sense."" That may not be the exact quote, but that is how I remember it. Thank you."
3,Effective as a teaching device,"""The Goal"" is effective at teaching a new method for approaching operations metrics in a business. The Socratic method employed by the author sometimes feels silly but it does seem like a way to improve the efficiency of your business. Required pre-enrollment reading for me at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business so I cannot affirm nor deny whether this method worked for me.Clearly the author is a scientist and not a Pulitzer prize winner -- the story rambles at times and the end in particular doesn't seem to tie in with the rest of the story. Pretty quick read, however. You may even be able to knock this book out while on a cross-country flight."
4,"Good book, drags towards the end","I had to read this book for an MBA class in Operations that I am taking. We have to turn in a report about our take aways from the book. This book is around 330 pages. While the concepts that the author wants to teach are cleverly woven around the story, there are times when the story meanders. It slows down to a real drag after page 300, I couldn't wait for it to be over.On the positive side, this is a good novel with some interesting insights and a good read."
5,Great book!,"i consider it one of the best books i ever read, realy summarizes the operations managment in a very easy manner yet the content is very valuable and telling the whole thing as a story..."
4,Everybody should read this book,This is a very interesting book that is very good for anybody managing a company. I read this book for my engineering degree and I liked it. Because this book is written in a dialogue the reader isn't only introduced to the career part of a persons life but also to the part of the rest of the day after you come home from work.
4,"Easy to read, rich of interesting ideas. Highly recommended for every manager.","It is a novel, and keeps you interested from beginning to end. Even if it is quite an old book in this field, remains actual and it is a good introduction for the theory of constraints. Especially as I believe you could give it to almost everybody that works in any organization and they won't be bored.One star is missing as I would have found useful to get some of the real-life, practical methods as an appendix, rather than on separate books.The interviews included are quite interesting, though.So, overall, great book and highly suggested to managers and team members in any organization, regardless of its size."
2,Not easy to use,"The 3 rings overlap with each other creating a thickness that does not allow normal 3 hole paper to move easily. I had to double punch my papers to create bigger holes just to get the rings to close properly and my papers don't ""flip"" easily. I would see if there is a different ring section for the rack system before purchasing these. (The rack system that goes with this is fine)."
1,No warranty-- beware!,"I purchased this about six months ago, and we've been happy with the quality until we pushed the pause button and it fell into the machine, ne'er to be seen again! Upon calling Amazon, I discovered what another reviewer mentioned... that there is no warranty, and apparently this company does not exist, as there is no website, no phone number, nothing available. It's a risky way to spend $140."
1,No Warranty!,"Bought this DVD player November 2004. Initially it worked fine. 7 months later it won't read any DVDs & the screen stays blank. There apparently is no warranty for this product. I ended up buying a portable DVD player by Polaroid. Much better quality, a 7"" screen and a warranty.If you buy the Malata DVD player invest in the One-Year Replacement Plan. Otherwise if it fails you are out of luck."
5,Works great,This DVD player has a great picture and sound. My kids love it in the car. Best thing I have bought in a long time!!!!!
2,No earphones?,"The discription says earphones. None got earphones in packages so should state that. Picture in steaky(lines)and not widescreen just full screen. Portable DVD Players are better with 10"" or 11"" screens,much clearer and use less battery power."
3,"the mistakes bothered me, but still good","I would have given this book a higher rating, but it had hugemistakes! There is no grade 6 in Jr High (yet there was a 6th gradeteacher mentioned), and there is no Homeroom (yet there was). I wish the author(s) would keep their facts straight! Other than that, I thought it was good. I have completely fallen in love with Damon! He is so sweet, especially how he wanted to make Homecoming for Jessica so perfect. Too bad there isn't a guy who's planning to do that for MY Homecoming tomorrow!"
4,It is a good book! better then sweet valley twins!,"FRANCINE PASCAL NEVER ANSWERED MY QUESTION! DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT IN THIS BOOK IT SAYS THAT THEIR IS A 6TH GRADE TEACHER WHEN THERE IS NO 6TH GRADE IN THIS SCHOOL. AND IT SAYS THAT JESSICA IS IN HOMEROOM, AND IN BOOK #1 THE GYM TEACHER SPECIFICALLY TOLD JESSICA AND ELIZABETH THAT THERE IS NO HOMEROOM IN SWEET VALLEY JR. HIGH!"
4,OKAY,"this book was good except 4 a few mistakes: 1.there is no 6th grade at the junior high, yet Miss Fenton teaches 6th grade science. 2.when the twins first arrived at junior high, miss scarlet told the twins that there is no homeroom, but now there is one! 3.(about the whole series)is anyone else wondering how the twins got from 6th grade at SVM to 8th grade at SVJH? BUT all in all it was a good storyline and it made me fall in love with Damon! HE ROCKS! it is soooooo sweet how he wants to make the dance special for jessica."
5,Can the homecoming be saved?,"This was one of my favorites in the series. Jessica gets put in charge of the homecoming committee and gets all her new friends to join. But instead of getting along, all her friends are constantly at each other's throats! Finally she's so fed up that Elizabeth, taking pity on the situation, agrees to switch with Jess and take over the committee. But the committee members know Jess too well and figure out that the girls switched. But they decide not to let on they know and do their best to make the dance terrific! Plus Damon wants to ask Jessica to the dance... if only he can get up the nerve, he'll make it the best night ever for her. ('if' being the operative word) My favorite scene was when Jessica ended up going to Liz's zone meeting. It was so funny! I can't believe that the Zone members didn't recognize Jessica! This was a great book- must read in the series."
3,Spalding Basketball System,"The backboard and rim are good enough, although a bit less stable than I had hoped. The problem and disappointment for me was the installation of the pole into the sleeve in the concrete. You are supposed to insert the pole in a plastic sleeve in the cement, let it set, then remove the pole, fill the pole with cement, let it set, and re-insert the pole ito the sleeve. Unfortunately, the sleeve contracted requiring me to chip away some of the concrete, and then I had to climb a ladder and pound the pole (doused in a lubricant) with a sledge hammer into the sleeve in order to insert it. I bought this system as I was under the impression that I'd be able to remove the pole if I decided I wanted to move it. Not going to happen now. The pole will never be removed unless I break out all of the concrete. If you want to have the option of possibly moving the system, this product isn't for you."
3,Nobodys Fool,"Interesting book, never are sure whats going to happen next. You need to follow closley.A story about normal everyday pople and how they live and die."
4,"Great Book, Bad EBook","This was a great read. The characters reminded me of what I remember of the inhabitants of Cannery Row and Tortilla Flats. They are engaging and colorful. I am glad to become acquainted with Mr. Russo and will read him in the future.That being said, the Ebook version I read was really poorly done. Random italics popped up throughout and distracting typos abounded. It looked like they'd run it through a cheap OCR and released to Kindle without reading it once. For instance, the ""El"" in ""El Camino"" consistently was printed with a UK Pound symbol sign instead of an E . (I don't have that key in this browser). Very distracting."
2,Sully is not terribly likeable,"This novel was written well enough. My only real problem with it was that I couldn't relate in any way to the main character, and I'm doubtful that most literate people could. I wanted to like him, but he's a lazy man who doesn't take care of himself and throughout the progression of the book, he shows no improvement. It made it a little hard to care what happened to him enough to keep reading. Other characters were far more interesting (like the main character's landlady). I would've been interested to hear more from them instead."
2,What's with all the kvelling?,"So far I've seen 67 out of 68 positive reviews for this book, and I say ""Hurrah"" for Richard Russo for all his positive praise. However, I disagree. The book has a flimsy to nonexistent foundation, that being backstory which takes circuitous twists and turns, and those turns take further turns.. So far I'm averaging 3 to 4 pages a night, and I'm a prolific reader. Why is Russo so fearful of forwarding the plot? Why the back and forth, the past histories upon past histories of every minor character? Just too much ""muchiness"" as the Brits would say."
5,One of the funniest and best written books ever!,This book had me sitting up until well after midnight to finish it and then when I got to the end I couldn't bear for there not to be more for me to read. Not only was I laughing hysterically outloud while reading this book I also immediately emailed some of my favorite sections to my friends so that they could crack up as well. I can't wait until I forget some of this book so I can have the pleasure of reading it again. A bunch of people are getting this book as a present from me this year - it's that good. Read it!!!
4,Fun Upstate New York Characters,"I really enjoyed reading this book, which is a sort of character book rather than a story with a plot. The setting is Upstate New York. I think this is one of the reasons I like the book so much, since I lived several years in Upstate New York and thought Russo's depiction was quite accurate.There are two main characters: an elderly, retired school teacher named Beryl, and a 50'ish beer drinking, blue collar worker named Sully. You grow to love both of these characters. The book maintains interest throughout; it never gets boring.I highly recommend this book."
5,Laugh out loud at midnight !,"This book kept not only me but my boyfriend laughing out loud. Russo's colorful development of a multiude of characters has left me wanting more. It has also left me disappointed in other books since I read his! I felt like these people were part of my life and I didn't want the book to end. There is not one wasted word or character in this book. It will definitely give you something to think about the next time you drive or pass through small-town America. All is not as quiet and peaceful as it may seem! Even in a ""quiet"" little town, there is enough drama for everyone. I am hooked on Russo's writing!"
5,Delightful characters,"I read Nobody's Fool a second time for a book club. I thought that I would get bored with it, but by the 3rd page was was completely engrossed the second time around. If I described the plot, it would seem depressing, but the characters are real and they are what make the book seem anything but depressing."
5,great,"Just like the male version, this was a lot of fun for the girls. Was pleased to find a girl version."
3,Harriet,"I wish I had gotten the boy, because you put a beard on it too ,I haven't given this to my 2 year old grandaughter yet and I am saving for later to play with in the car ,I had these as a kid ,fun toy"
3,It's ok but,grandkids didn't have much interest after initially opening on Xmas morn.They may be too old or kids just don't get amused by things I did as a kid.They have all these electronic games and high graphics etc.
4,Fun and Creative Old Fashioned Toy!,"A creative, no batteries needed old fashioned fun toy that any child would like. Great for Christmas stockings or Easter baskets, or even party favors!"
3,OK toy,"Toy arrived in good condition. It is cardboard (which I already knew), so it is not the most durable toy."
4,An Introduction to Indian Philosophy,"This book is exactly what its title says it is. Describes in brief the Hindu schools of Nyaya, Vaisesika, Sankhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, Vedanta, as well as Buddhism, Jainism, and Carvaka. A good job is done to explain why Nirvana as described by the Buddha can't be nonexistence, and why the tenants of materialism (the current dominant worldview) is flawed. Though old (eighth edition 1984) the ideas presented are still valid and relevant today. If you can find a copy (it probably isn't easy) read it. Most certainly, read it. This is a wonderful, though dry and unemotional, look at Indian philosophy. Precisely what it promises to be."
1,not for v6 nissan xterra,doenst fit v6. amazon parts finder incorrect. dont buy for v6 or you will have to send it back. only 5 wires in the kit. sent back
1,"This figure says, ""NOT FOR SALE"" on the package","Why is amazon letting Brian's Toys sell this promo only figure that has ""NOT FOR SALE"" printed on the card? Selling this figure is technically illegal and amazon should not allow it."
3,Not the best in the series,"I bought Trance Nation Future a few years ago and loved it. I didn't know there was a series of these CD's so when I saw this Cd I jumped at the chance to get it. When i listened to it, I was kind of disappointed. When I bought it I was so excited I didn't notice it was mixed by Judge Jules, that was my first mistake. I'm not a fan of his at all. I think he is a lame DJ. There are certain songs on this 2 disc set that are really good but the mix doesn't have that good of a flow to it as most of the mixes I have heard from Judge Jules. Trance Nation Future is great and Trance Nation Deeper is awesome but this one left a stale taste in my mouth."
3,uneven,"some pieces were lovely, some not relaxing and one in particular was barely audible. i got one for myself and one for a gift, but after listening to it, i wonder if the recipient will ever use it."
4,quite good post sixties collection,"start point 0 pointstime spanned (1962 -199?) +1,5 pointtrack selection (no late forties or fifties stuff in studio versions, though some live versions of it are here) +0.5 pointKey tracks 16/36 present (Sweet sixteen missing!!!) 0.5 pointlength (2cds 36 tracks, but not near 80 ) 1,5 pointstotal 4 pointsrecommendation: get it, but dont forget to buy also a pre 60's B. B. collection!)"
5,Awesome Movie,"I had seen this movie before and was very pleased with the story line and the actors. The movie is a great movie for viewing by children and adults, of all ages. It's one of those rare moments in ""movie"" history, that captures the relationships of both people and animals. In fact, it's the animals in the movie, that bring the two families together. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Love this movie,A family friendly movie with a great story and keeps your attention. Excellent job to actors and directors. The human actors did a great job also...
4,Zeus and roxanne dvd,"Great movie for all ages, especially for the younger generations. There is a lesson to be learned in this movie."
5,Great FAMILY film!! Received fast and was as described in very good condition.,"THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY FILM ... FUNNY, ENTERTAINING AND ALWAY FUN TO WATCH REPEATEDLY WITH YOUNGSTERS! THE DOG, ""ZEUS"" INTERACTS WITH A DOLPHIN, ""ROXANNE"" WITH A SPECIAL COMMUNICATION AND BONDING THAT IS FUNNY AND THRILLING TO KIDS & ADULTS ALIKE. MY GRANDSON, 17 MOS OLD, HAS SAT AND WATCHED IT OVER AGAIN ALL THE WAY THROUGH ... LOVING ANIMALS AND FISH, IT'S FASCINATING."
3,i love miko hughes,any movie that has miko hughes in it is somewhat good according to my standards. this one is also good beside his presance in the movie. the dog and dolphin are cute. the movies fun. i dont know why people dont like it its akids movie what do they expect.
1,terrible service,"bought the dvd , then never heard from them,until AFTER I sent an e-mail of where's my dvd,then a few days later they sent a reply it's not in stock and would refund my acct. a few days after that they did, and they still list the very same dvd for sale on the amazon site"
2,The Shipping Box Says Handle With Care,"As rice cakes go these are pretty good, but the shipping the last two times I've purchased has not been acceptable.These are rice cakes in plastic bags. That means they are fragile and the bags will tear. Removing a section off the shipping box, exposing 4 bags, and then thoroughly taping the exposed bags with packing tape is not very smart. The exposed bags are beaten up, and it is impossible to remove packing tape from a plastic bag without tearing the bag.The first time I thought it was an accident, but twice?"
2,Too much salt,"These rice cakes have too much salt: 65 mg per cake. I have purchased them several times but now I will stick to Quaker rice cakes which are much lighter and have 15 mg of salt per cake, which is 4 times less salt than these ones."
3,Not really a worthy product,"Good at first, but you'll get tired quickly of these so don't buy a bunch."
4,Not the air-puffed variety,"These rice cakes are tasty and substantial, not like the average super-market variety that is overly puffed with air. My kids have mild allergies to wheat and these fit the bill nicely."
1,Just Believe,The film has an interesting angle but based on faith with out works so the idea itself kills the film when it claims a Christ perspective. The film does pretty good engaging the viewer for a low budget production. The scenes filmed through the eyes of the Heavenly messenger are kind of creepy and reminiscent of a horror movie approach.
1,39 Minute movie?,"The movie was not the normal length of a movie. It was only thirty nine minutes. On further thought that was adequate because there was no development of characters and, and the audience can not understand the protangonist's psyche."
3,Makes the point,"A bit of a ""B"" movie and fairly short, but does a good job of telling the story. Worth a watch."
1,Belly Dance First Steps for Beginners,"Did not really get a chance to review this one because if would not work in any of our wiis. We have 2 and I tried it in both and it would not recognize the disc...cannot complain, amazon gladly refunded my $. I decided not to reorder."
4,I like this one but...,"I like this DVD because it makes me feel like I'm actually dancing, not just drilling isolations. I'm still a beginner but practice to several DVDs per week (no teacher yet.) I don't like that there's no warm up or instruction on posture. If this was my first DVD I would have been lost and overwhelmed. I started with Jenna's Bellydance Basics & Beyond (great for step-by-step instructions to learn the moves properly) and would recommend that one to accompany this one if you're a total beginner. But the DVD is still very fun, Neon is an amazing dancer!"
3,belly dancing blue background,This was kind of hard to catch on. The instructor was a little fast for a beginner. Overall not a bad video.
2,Definitely NOT for Beginners!,I am not new to dancing but I am a total newb to belly dancing. There is no warm up at all. She just jumps right on in to the drills without any indication of what she is doing and doesn't even tell you ahead of time that she is about to introduce a new step. This would be good for someone who isn't new but just needs a refreshment. I might try this again after I watch it a million time and actually catch on to her routine.
1,No at all easy to follow,"I bought these thinking it would be a step by step for total beginners, but it is very difficult to follow. The instructor doesn't give clear instructions. She just moves around and you have to follow without instructions. I have seen better belly dance instruction videos in Youtube for free. save your money"
3,getting used to,Im not a pro dancer im just a beginner. I got tired of watching youtube vids and mirroring so i finally bought a video of my own. I really fancy Neon and the color blue so this video had my name all over it :) once I started the instructions are fairly easy but it takes some getting used to. its a little too fast for me right now. but i think in time practice will pay off. so for all of you that want to refresh on the very basics I recommend this video. good luck and have fun :D
3,paperback size,"I was hoping the paperback book size would be a little larger. Disappointed because it was sort of a ""smallish"" book."
2,Easy read,"This is the kind of book your select when you don't want to have to put forth the effort to think. An easy, pleasant read."
4,Great beach read,"I read this book in record time. It was a fairly easy read but still interesting enough to make it difficult to put down. Fairly predictable ending, but it does keep you guessing until the end. Glad to have discovered ""Callahan Garrity""."
4,To Live and Die In Dixie,"I live in Georgia and can imagine the areas that are depicted, so this series is of more interest for me. They have all kept my interest, and have been entertaining but not too thought consuming as some books. Wish there were more in this series, as I have enjoyed all of them."
3,Overpriced toy,"An overpriced toy. The table itself runs without discernable wobble, but the antiskate doesn't seem to work properly (I set my stylus pressure at under 2 but had to set the antiskate at maximum to keep the arm from sliding immediately over the blank space on the test record). Don't set the volume too high--at a certain point a feedback begins that would probably blow your speakers if you let it go. It's all plastic and light so plan to be very still while listening or the needle will go jumping all over the place."
3,DENON = YUGO,The turntable looks nice Price and quality about to be RIGHT ! But doesn't work nice! The speed of rotation is vary and is very difficult yo set-up! Once is set it works but not for a long! The manual screw underneath for speed set-up is so senseless and it doesn't do anything for 1/16 of turn then is a huge difference in a speed and it is so hard to do it by yourself ( you need one more guy to help you)!Sound is OK when everything is OKAY otherwise guess yourself. I am electronic Ing. and fixing any kind of devices is my specialty and I love fixing Turntables and I did a lot of them of every kind in the past. They should think to put little bit better speed regulator then the one in a CHEAP MOTOR SCREW !Over All Its not a bad product Reminds Me on Serbian (Yugoslavian) YUGO Cheap and once tuned correctly it does work OKAY otherwise is constant headache !
1,Sounds great but terrible build quality,"The Denon Turntable sounds great. Even the stock needle has a pretty nice rounded full sound. But the build quality on the one I received was terrible. I DJ and know turntables very well so I know how to set it up, that was not the issue. I just bought this for casual listening in the living room but the auto arm didn't even fall on the record platter. It also scrapped across the record when it returned. Other pieces and screws needed to be tightened. Ultimately I returned it because it was so janky. Proceed with caution."
4,Does the job,"Looks out of place with my other gear, kind of cheap looking but it does the job well. Sounds good"
1,More care needs to be taken with packing!,"I give this rating at this time as the turntable arrived broken, so we have not been able to use it yet. I am waiting for an exchange authorization, so the rating may change later if the turntable arrives in perfect condition."
1,Do not bother,"I made the mistake in buying a used turntable. When it arrived from this warehouse I knew looking at thebeat up box it came in that I'll be unpleasantly surprised. Here is a partial list of missing items : counter-balance,headshell, cartrige, needle, drive-belt,connecting wires between head shell and cartrige etc. On thesite of this Warehouse they advertised it as being in "" very-good condition"" If one item was missing I could haveallowed it thinking it was a packaging ommission but when so much is missing it's not just negligence...So do yourselves a favor and buy NEW ! The Denon turntable itself is supposed to be a great buy but only ifit's new."
5,Watch / learn this or equivalent,"This was the first self help product I ever bought. It was way back in 1991. My life changed. My grades went from around 3.0 to 3.7 and I graduated in top 10% of my high school class. I went to Ga Tech (one of the top engineering schools in the country) and graduated w/ honors. More importantly, I continue to improve all areas of my life because this particular area was so effective"
3,Pretty good. Geared tord children.,This was a really good book. It is very short but explaines alot.
2,Not representative of Ben Bova's writing,"For the time it was written and published, this book was incredibly visionary. The Internet didn't take over our lives until after 1997 - it hasn't been that long! So don't knock it. Those who claim it was a jaded idea when it was written could never have come up with anything with foresight like he could.This book is not representative of just how awesome Mr. Bova's writing is. I suggest reading Moonwar or The Kinsman Saga, anything from 1990 on."
2,"Outdated, plus it doesn't live up to its potential","Cyberbooks was written in 1989, and is based on the premise that one day books will be delivered electronically to handheld devices, instead of printed on paper. Since you're reading this on ( ), you know that this was not particularly visionary - it's true today, barely a decade later. Even at that time, this was pretty easy to predict. That's not the book's main problem though. The problem is, it's pretty dumbed-down. I had read the Exiles Trilogy by the author a couple of times, and was disappointed by this book. I know he can write better. There are parts that read like Bova was going for a farce, but it's unclear - it may just be bad writing. The book also has some totally unnecessary about the Japonese. Get the Exiles Trilogy, not this one."
4,Pioneer days of the future on one of Jupiter's moons,"This book is about a boy and his father who get to head out to the frontier of one of Jupiter's moons to be farmers. Lured by stories of no rationing, land of thier own they take off with bright hopes of a good comfortable living as farmers. After a trip on a crowded spaceship and some unexpected excitement to break up the boredom of the long trip they arrive in the promised land.As the old saying goes ""If it sounds too good to be true....""Father and son settle into local life. The brochures were right about one thing....they have plenty of food, no rationing, and they get to have some land. But, it's not what was expected. Hard work and the help of some good neighbors help them settle in and set up thier farm, but life is still fraught with dangers.Not as good as some of Heinlein's other books, but it's still a good book, fun to read, and gives food for thought."
4,"Tell me about the Jovian rabbits, George","Actually, I was pretty surprised by this one -- I'm not much of a fan of Heinlein, but his characters are compelling enough to drag me through this very episodic book.Despite the fact that everybody talks pretty much the same way that they do in other Heinlein books, and some characters obviously exist to make philosophical points, or to die conveniently, the main protagonist has enough depth to shift his point of view convincingly (except for some wild swings at the end), and not be the perfect Boy Scout. This book shows its age, but its still clearly thought out with many interesting ideas."
3,Luke warm for me,"I love Heinlein, but I was luke warm on the whole science fiction meets Little House on the Prairie, with a late half formed contact with ancient alien technology thrown in as an after thought.The inclusion of the cavern / crystals / alien walker may have been meant to titilate, but it felt more like the author was even bored himself, and wanted to add something to keep readers interested.If it was aimed at younger readers, then it may have struck more home with them, but I was left thinking what could have been, and off to see what the Star Beast has to offer..."
4,Great Nostalgia,I loved this toy as a kid. My girlfriend had never heard of it so I had to get her one!! It is so fun to play with and reminds me of my childhood.
1,Not how I remembered it.,"I bought this because my son loves making faces on people. The problem with it is the magnet in the pen is not strong enough, the magnetic dust falls off the second you remove the pen. Its not the way I remember it. The magnet on the pen barely lifts the stuff. It's pretty cheap. The pen pops out of the cardboard at the bottom, it really has no place to be held by the toy.Overall its cheap (that's why it only cost $3)...find something else."
3,Magnetic Face Board,"I remembered these as a kid. Gave one to my Grandson for Christmas. The magnet is SO small, it hardly even picks up the metal filings. Not as fun as I remembered...Hard for a 5 year old to maneuver."
2,ersatz Gor,"I'm on a serious JAK re-read, and just came across this book. It's... how can I put this politely? boring. And the plot doesn't make a lot of sense. it's barbarian me strong man you weak woman stuff, and that the heroine comes to like her servitude doesn't make it any easier. I think I'll just stick with her romantic suspense from now on."
5,There is no one like JKA !!!,This one of her older books and it is wonderful. It is one of those that I could not put down. KRENTZ caught my interest from page one until the end. Excellent!!!
5,Loved It,Jayne Ann Krentz is one of my favorite authors. It's enjoyable that she writes a series using all of her pen names.
3,Book,I have enjoyed many books this author has written and greatly look forward to reading many more. This book was less enjoyable than her others.
5,a good book for the 2nd time,"Although this was a reissue, it was fun to re-read a book that I have enjoyed many times. I often grab Jayne's books when I run out of something to read. I was happy to see that it became available for my Kindle."
3,An okay read,"The story was interesting enough, but lacked the potential to keep me on my toes and willing to read well into the night."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting something different. Don't get me wrong, Annie Haslam sings beautifully on this album, it is just that I am a fan of another style of music."
3,Typical SODOM album,This is a very nice effort from this german band to remain on top of the world's thrash bands.By far their best album is Persecution Mania.
3,steve vai,"I wish it had the break down like some of the other Signature Licks series. Had no idea what ""Naked Vamps"" were. If you love Vai this is for you. If you are looking to learn note for note it is here in the book, just not on the cd for reference."
4,Great Product. Poor Instructions.,I am very happy with the system. It is very sturdy and well built. My only complaint is that the instructions were very vague on several steps.
2,Very poor base design & instructions,"Followed directions to the letter. The pole base (mine came as 2 pieces) came apart because the two pieces didn't fit together well. There's no reference point or specific depth mentioned as to how deep the poles should be connected together. So we tamped them as far as we could drive them, and filled both pieces with concrete as instructed. After a few days, the top split from the bottom. Now I have a base filled with concrete and concreted in the ground, and an upper piece filled with concrete and laying on the ground. Worthless. I hope their return & exchange works well. Very poor design & instructions. Buy something else."
2,Spalding In-Ground Basketball System,"To be honest, I am not very impressed with this product. I wanted to make sure the pole and backboard were level and straight so I hired someone to set the sleeve for the pole. We followed the instructions precisely and got the project done over a three-day weekend. Unfortunately, I measured the rim and it is only 9' 9"" which is pretty sad. The top of the sleeve is exactly at ground level so there is either a flaw in the hydraulic system or in the instructions. Secondly, the crank system for this backboard is pretty much trash. It is very difficult to crank up and down and I snapped 3 bolts before buying a grade 8 bolt from a hardware store. If I had to purchase a backboard again I would most definitely not purchase this one."
3,I guess it's OK for the price,"As previously stated by another reviewer, my backboard is also tilted backwards at the top. The poll is level so that's not what is causing it. With the design the way it is, i.e. no slotted holes, there is absolutely no way to make an adjustment to correct it.The pole is one piece, not three. I had to place 2x4's into the top of the ground sleeve to provide a vertical extension surface to place the level on for checking it while the concrete was drying.The included manual (ID# M8809A40) is the wrong one. It S/B (M8809441). This is one of the reasons the instructions are flat out inaccurate in some points. Even with the right manual, there are still discrepancies.My rim is 1 inch short of 10 feet. The in ground sleeve has to be placed in the hole at the exact specified height or you will end up short. No room for error. They should have designed the screw jack to be able extend another inch above 10 feet to allow for compensation."
2,bball review,"Here's the deal with this bball system...The instructions are bad, flat out inaccurate in some points. My rim ended up being 3 inches short of 10 feet and the backboard is tilted backwards at the top. Not particularly steady when the ball hits the rim and board; the rim is dead and the whole thing shakes. I would not recommend this to a friend. Sorry Spaulding, but that's the truth..."
2,not tough enough,"I bought this bag to pack in for a few trips while flying. After the fourth flight (and only 2 months after purchase), I picked up my bag at the baggage claim only to find a strap torn and a zipper broken. I liked it until then. I have yet to send in the warranty claim, so maybe they'll make it right . . ."
2,Bag vs. United Airlines: Fatality!,"This bag *looks* tough and well-constructed (and is definitely roomy), but I began to have misgivings about its longevity when I pulled it off of the carousel after its first flight and noticed the heavy scuffing gouging into the surface of the fabric. It then did okay for two weeks of travel -- being pulled on and off of trains and taxis, rolling a few blocks to the next hotel, etc. -- but it was the Chicago-LA leg of the flight home that killed it off. It arrived with one of the end pockets hanging open -- the zipper was still there, but the zipper head had been pulled completely off the teeth and was nowhere to be seen. Good thing that we hadn't packed anything in that pocket! At this price, I expect a bag to last longer than two weeks; if I wanted disposable luggage, I'd shop at Wal-Mart."
5,La Guardia Travel bag,Bought as a gift. This is a quality bag that holds a lot. Great price compared to other bags in this price range.
5,We love it!!!,"My 7 year old son absolutely loves this toy. It doesn't come with much paper; however, I bought black card stock at Michaels arts and crafts store and cut it to size...now he is back in business.As the paper spins, the music plays (you can also turn the music off), and the black light in the background makes the neon colors glow(especially in the dark). The effect of the glowing, spinning artwork is amazing!! With this toy, anyone can be an artist!!!"
5,AWSOME AWSOME FUN TOY,"This has got to be one of the best things i ever bought my kids!!!!!!!!!!! Even the adults loved it and we have found that you dont only have to use the paper we even put 4x4 household floor tiles on it making sure they were centered and the kids painted them not only with the paint that came with the thing but with the paint you find in any craft store. then we sprayed them with clear spray paint and you can use them for coasters or as i am gonna do use them for a back splash made by my kids. This is a MUST BUY TOY FOR ALL AGES my 4 year old grandson was even able to use this with no problem, and they have ran the thing for many hours and it is still using the same batteries that it came with."
2,Big disappointment.,"I've been an LL fan since way back. His first two albums (RADIO and BIGGER AND DEFFER) were tha bomb! His next three were pretty good, but this one was a major disappointment. It plays more like an R&B album than a rap album. I can understand a rapper mellowing out, but this is ridiculous. The only songs I really enjoyed on this album were 4,3,2,1 and FATHER. The rest had kinda blase lyrics and mediocre production. BRING BACK MARLY MARL! C'mon LL, I know you got more talent than this...get angry again! Trust me, this is a sub-par performance for LL. I hope he can come back from it. If the the last few soundtrack singles he's done are any indication, he's still got the skillz. They're off the hook!"
4,Impressive,"This came out when LL was at an all time high of his carrer. After a few successful movies and albums, LL's move to Lifestyles of The Rich and famous was a giving. YET..when he released this album, I wasn't expecting something this good. After a bunch of albums that I felt just didnt measure up during the early and mid 90's, 1997 proved to be good with Phenomenon. The title track is a treaure, with a smooth flow and amazing beat. Even though there is some filler material on here, there are some great songs in on this including great hip-hop artist as Redman, Busta, DMX, Cannibus, and Method Man. This one is really good folks, and the best he did since 1987's Bigger and Deffer. What a way to celebrate a 10yr aniversy of one of top 25 hip hop albums made...ENJOY"
2,Bad Album,"only good track is 4,3,2,1 and that's cause hard ones like Dmx and canibus ripped it ll cool j may not be a bad rapper but this is no doubt a terrible release for def jam.5 of 10 lyrics 5 of 10 beats"
4,Very good when you don't want to disturb others,Makes the instrument go silent to others while you continue to be able to practice. At it as in tune if you were playing live but if you want or need to practice without disturbing others then use this. DO NOT BUY THE MUTE ONLY. BE SURE TO BUY THE MUTE AND AMPLIFIER.
1,Poor quality,"After washing once (per the manufacturer's instructions), this item was unravelling at the seams and was covered in fabric pills. I doubt that it is going to withstand much more use. Meanwhile, the Carters waterproof pads that I have leftover from my daughter's infancy are still in great condition.I would highly recommend that you purchase the pads from Carters instead. They are clearly far more durable."
4,Love the big size,"I bought this for the bigger size and because it is hard to find. I had one of this size from a friend and the only difference between that one and this one is the backing - this one is more flannel like only both sides whereas the one from my friend is a little more ""slick""."
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"This bed rail is the absolute worst. It does not lock properly. When you throw all your weight on one side to push it down to lock it, it will lock. But once you go to the other side to lock it, the first side pops up and unlocks. It's like a comedy routine. You may get it to seemingly lock on both sides, but one side will unlock at some point on its own.Also, this rail sits on top of the bed, so your blankets get pinned down on one side. If you were to use 2 rails, you could never get the covers up. The rails also sit in several inches, so a single bed gets very narrow.This product is unsafe, and with serious design flaws. Save yourself the frustration of putting it together, wrestling with it, and returning it."
2,Safety Netting Frays,"We purchased this bedrail about a month ago and loved it until last week. I love the security it provides for my daughter's bed. When it is installed properly, it is very sturdy. However, I noticed some threads coming out of the netting on the top rail last week. Now, we have about a 4 inch hole in the seam of the netting. The material is too flimsy to sew up, so we will have to throw it away. My daughter is 2 1/2, only 25 pounds and is not a climber, so the material just came apart from normal, everyday use. I'm very frustrated that I will have to go out and buy safety rail #3. (The first one was made by Evenflo and was not tall enough to provide protection from falling off the bed.)"
5,Very very sturdy and safe!,"We did not buy ours, but received it used for free. I have to agree that if you install it properly, it is very VERY sturdy. There's no knocking this off of our bed. It really grabs and holds the mattress tightly. My only issue is with the price. It seems a bit high for what the item is, but as well as it works, it's worth it to pay a bit more for quality. I was only lucky I didn't have to buy mine new."
1,What a piece of junk!!!,"I agree with the person who wanted to throw this thing against the wall. The first and only night I used it , it fell down three times and my daughter wasn't anywhere near it. It woke her up everytime. It is also very load when you are locking it up which is not good if your child is a light sleeper. This is a horrible product and I am disappointed that Toys R us has such a little selection in this area."
1,stinks,"Do not buy this bed rail..I figured it was more expensive than the rest, so it should be better. It is the worst..one side does not stay in the locked position. It is horrible!!DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,Fell Apart with Baby in Bed!!,"This is the WORSE product! We put it together as instructed, placed baby in bed for the first time and the side rails fell down. The manufacturer said this ""sometimes happens"" and could wait 2-4 weeks for a replacement sent to us. We will never buy another Safety First product."
4,"It works, just don't be dumb.","It's always important to read the bad reviews to see the real reason why people don't like a product. In some cases, it's just ignorance that leads to a bad review. In the case of this bed rail, I saw that many people said (1) it doesn't fit thick mattresses and (2) it comes unlocked.All I can say is that if you're having these problems, then you're just not following the directions.First, there are thickness adjustments on each side. It comes shipped in the smallest position, so all of these stories about people stuggling to close the rail just make me laugh. Just open it all the way up, lock the ""elbow"" in place, and then squeeze it until the indicator shows ""locked."" Done.As for unlocking, all I can say is that you didn't lock it in the first place. If I have one complaint, it's that it's too hard to unlock when properly locked. My wife can't even do it.Bottom line: while there might be better bed rails out there, this rail does work and does fit thick mattresses."
2,Good Concept,"This guardrail sits on top of the matress so there is no worries about the child getting stuck between the matress and rail. The problem we had was setting it up. It did not stay in position. We shook it with some force and it kept coming out of position, then when we shook it with very little force it stayed.When our 21 month old went to sleep, he woke up 30 minutes later screaming. The rail had fallen down again and scared him!Took it back to Babies R Us and told them what had happened. They just took it back and credited my card with no questions or comments."
1,May be safe but impossible to use,This item is very awkward to set up and use. Never was able to get it to lock properly and finally gave up in frustration. It may be a very safe product but when it is unusable it is not safe at all. I returned mine to Toys R Us on a Tuesday and was not suprised to find out that 3 others had been returned already that week.
1,Product Should Be Recalled...,"I purchased this bedrail a few weeks ago (brand new) and used it for the first time last night. And today...it broke! With little force applied, the hinge connecting the screen to the foot under the mattress snapped, exposing a sharp plastic piece and leaving enough area for my 2-year old to fall out of bed. Safety first, although nice, was WELL AWARE of the problem and knew the specific issue I was explaining before I even finished describing it. I asked why there hadn't been a recall if this was a known problem and I was told that it was a relatively new product, that there hadn't been enough complaints yet to warrant a recall, and that there hadn't been any SERIOUS injuries reported. Parents beware!!"
1,don't buy this product,"I bought two of these for my son when he moved into his big boy bed and was instantly frustrated upon removing it from the box. My husband, an engineer, easily figured out how to set it up, and explained it to me, however the first time I tried to put it down, it broke at the elbow. My husband then had to jimmy a way to get the elbow back in. The second one did the same. Once secured, there is nothing that will get it to move, but it takes a long time to get it locked into place, even when you know how to do it. Although I don't have personal experience, there must be a better product out there that is both safe, easy to use, and doesn't break easily."
1,unsafe,"I was fairly happy with this bedrail until I discovered how unsafe it can be in the down position. My toddler quickly figured out that he can use the bedrail as a makeshift ladder. As I was making the bed, he climbed onto the bedrail and fell off before I could reach him. He hit his face and jaw on the rail, which caused a nasty bruise. DO NOT leave this bedrail in the down position--very dangerous!"
1,Awful Product!!,"I hate this bed rail. It doesn't stay locked like its supposed to. It also smashes the mattress down which can't be very good for the mattress. I had it less than a week and the rail came out of the foot support. That part came assembeled and is impossible to put back in. I'm going to try and return it (don't have the receipt!!) Buy a simpler, product!! I wish I could find the Elmo bed rail that my daughter has for her bed!!"
2,No thank you!,"This was the only rail carried by the two stores I went to. Concept and assembly - ok. When I tried to lower the rail so my daughter could get in, a piece popped out. I can't say what piece (on the elbow, I think to help lower the rail). This part was already assembled when it came out of the box so it was impossible to push it back in. Back to the store it goes and I'll just use the one I had with my first daughter. It doesn't fold so I'll just have to put it in the closet during the day."
1,WANT TO THROW THIS THING AGAINST THE WALL,"Subject should say it all. This guard is almost impossible and extremely frustrating to use. If you need to sneak out of bed quietly you can forget it. Go for something simpler, this thing is a real pain in the neck."
2,Not good for thick mattres,"When i first bought this rail, I had trouble getting it to lock into place, it's a big pain. It kept collapsing and I was afraid that my son would get hurt. Finally after trying for 30 minutes to get it to lock it staid in place and kept my son from falling.I bought a second one because my son has new bed that is placed off the wall and I wanted 2 rails. The second piece would not lock in place at all. When it finally did I found out it does not fit with a thicker mattress. I have to bring it back.I would not buy this one again, too big of a chance it collapses. I checked it every nite to make sure it would not collapse.Sandy"
1,Its a(...)nightmare,"This is the biggest piece of [junk] I have ever bought. U must know that once u assemble the piece of doodoo u can't disasemble it. So what if you want to return it u just can't. Plus its not secure at all since my 21 pound daughter moved it. (...). Yes the side comes down but its a [hard] to work it. I just have one thing to say to Safety 1st, you people don't know the first thing about safety. Dont buy it please dont buy it."
2,What a pain....,"This bed rail is such a pain. Once you manage to get the bedrail attached the sheets don't move. You can move the one side of the sheet without the bedrail but trying to put a comforter or blanket on is a pain. I had to use a little baby quilt on my daughter instead of her new ""big girl"" one she got with her new bed. It is also very cumbersum to take the side up and down. We read to our daughters ever night and my older daughters rails come down in a snap. This new one is very difficult and the bad thing is you can't find the old kind anymore."
1,This bed rail sucks,"I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!! I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed. It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed. And it would constantly come unlocked. And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty. I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove."
1,Horrible Bed Rail,"I just purchased 2 of these rails for my 18 month old's bed. (He's crawling out of his crib) I was able to put them together easily, however when I folded the sides down they both broke. My husband was able to fix one, however if it broke on the 1st use I don't think it will last for long. I would never recommend this product and I am very disappointed in the Safety 1st brand. I will be returning this product tomorrow!"
2,Doesn't work on thick mattresses,"This rail is a pain in the neck to lock in place, once it's there it stays put but we bought it with the idea of being able to change the sheets easily by dropping the side. Big mistake, once it's off it takes all of my husbands strength to put it back on again. We have a reasonably thick mattress, say 10 inches, so if you have something thinner than this you might consider it, otherwise don't bother. We're taking it back..."
5,Works well! Glad I purchased this!,"I moved my 3 1/2 yr old into a bed and this railing has kept her secure for a year now. It stays in place well and stays locked. Even when leaned against or kicked, it stays in place. Glad I made this purchase. I'll be using it for my 2 year old who is moving into a bed in about 6 weeks."
4,decent bed rail,"Overall, I like this bed rail. Safety is of upmost concern, and I loved the fact this style of bed rail prevented the child from becoming entrapped between the rail and the bed. (Children have actually died or been injured by this....) It does take up some of the actual space on top of the mattress, but it's worth it, and the loss of space is really minimal. I found the rail to be secure; I could even roll against it and it didn't budge. After only 4-5 months of use, however, it did break where one of the side rails lock into the base section. Despite this, I'm going out to Target to get the same thing again. Overall, I think it's a great, safe design that perhaps needs a little tweaking.... I'd buy it again (and will do so today!)..."
2,Definitely Disappointed,I was definitely disappointed in this product. The rail isn't long enough and it smashes the mattress. I still had to use other things like a chair and pillows to keep my child from rolling out of the bed. I will be purchasing a different one very soon.
3,works for my son,"Yes, I can see where people would find this to be a pain to put up. Other then the first time to figure out how it worked we haven't had problems. I like knowing that my son can't roll off the bed and get caught between the bed and the rails. It does as other people have stated take up a few inches of the bed but to me it's worth it. It stays in place. We tried others but for our son this bed rail works."
2,Buy The Other One,"This isnt THAT bad of a product, if it was the only one available I would reccomend it. But I have bought 2 of them now and I prefer the ""especially for toddlers"" over this one. (I think that is the brand) The reasons for my opinion are:1. Because it sits on top of the bed, it takes up too much of the mattress. Some people like this feature and say it seems more secure, but I think it is just as secure as the other one that has a strap that locks under the entire mattress. This one takes up a good 2-3 inches of my sons bed!2. Although not impossible to put together, it did require more effort than the other one. The other one needed no tools for assembly.3. It is cheaper- usually people think cheaper in price means cheaper in value, but this is not the case.Trust me on this one. I have had both brands and the especially for toddlers brand is a better buy. If that one isnt available, fine- buy this one."
2,Not worth the Aggravation!,"We originally purchased two of these bed rails for our twin daughters. We have now returned them THREE times due to the fact that they keep breaking at the elbow (mind you, these have been three different rails that have broken in the same way, not the same one breaking three times). When they are assembled and on the bed they've worked okay...occasionally the lock slips a little, but never enough to make the rail fall down. Unfortunately, this is the only rail available at our local store to fit our thick mattress. However, now that I have to return this again, I will be searching to find something better."
2,Safety 1st bed rails,"I appreciated the added safety measures. However, the rails take up too much space on top of the mattress. They are not at all easy to use, difficult to lock and when disengaged they stick out about a foot from the bed making them unsightly and difficult to make the bed. A better ""mousetrap"" need be invented."
5,So far so good.,"We just put our 2.5 yr old in a twin bed. There are not alot of selection available in stores and I am familar with Safety 1st. This took maybe 10 minutes to assemble, no difficulties at all. When we put it on the bed, I will admit that it did take us awhile to figure out that you can extend the net to get the best fit on the mattress. Now figuring that out, it works great. The first night I slept with my daughter, leaned on the rail and everything and it stayed in tact!"
2,Not Satisfied--Returned The Product,"This product is very secure, but it is difficult to get the rail up and down. It was impossible to fool with everyday when trying to make the bed, so I returned it!"
1,"AWFUL, UNSAFE PRODUCT!!!!","I bought this bed rail (unfortunately, before reading the reviews here on Amazon) at a local discount store. I used it hesitantly one night. The next morning I tried to lower it to make the bed using the instructions provided and the bed rail broke beyond repair at the elbow, in the exact same place others at Amazon are reporting theirs have broken. This is an obvious defect. Additionally, the one night I did use it, I locked it into position several times (until the green lock symbol showed, as instructed) and this bed rail unlocked and popped up off the bed at least 5 times. It did this when my husband ""locked"" it, too. I did finally seem to get it to lock, but was worried about it all night, since it had unlocked so many times. If it breaks this easily and I can't be sure whether it is truly locked or not, I sure won't trust it to hold my kid safely in bed. I took that bad boy straight back to the store & got my money back."
1,Did not like this rail.,I purchased this rail thinking it would be wonderful. One of the ones I bought broke at the elbow like others are complaning about. I went to return it and didn't have the box so I was unsuccessful. It also sticks out from the bed so far that when it is down I can't carry my toddler to bed and place him in while asleep. I am to short to do this and I am 5'5. I hope you will have other choices when you go to the store.
1,Does NOT STAY LOCKED!!!,"I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this rail and will return it asap. Bottom line: this rail does not stay in the locked position. I pull up the rail and lock it into position and verify, according to the directions, that the lock indicator window is green. Then, with just the tiniest bit of a pull inward by touching the top of the rail (such as a child may do while in bed), the rail unlocks and pops open completely. UNSAFE!!!"
1,Very Unsatified,"Short and to the point, do not buy this gate. It does not live up to its name or promises. The gate does not fold down very well and is rather difficult to get to stay locked and in the place that best fits your bed. It is sturdy but that is its only plus. I am looking for its replacement and will return it as soon as I do."
1,MOM OF 3 IN BROOKLYN,"THIS BED RAIL DOES STOP THE KID FROM FALLING OUT OF BED AND IT ALSO TAKES UP ABOUT SIX INCHES OF THE MATTRESS, COMPLETELY PREVENTS YOU FROM MAKING THE BED WITH OUT TAKING IT OFF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF AGAIN AT NIGHT TO UNTUCK THE BLANKET. YOU WILL ALSO HAVE TO BUY MATTRESSES MORE OFTEN BECAUSE IT SQUEEZES THE MATTRESS IN ORDER TO LOCK AND AFTER ONLY A MONTH OF USE MY SONS MATTREESS HAS A PERMENANT INDENTATION. I HATE IT AND NOW CANT FIND ANY OTHER SINGLE BED RAIL THAT DOESN'T LOCK ON TOP OF THE MATTRESS."
1,Broke within weeks,"We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first. I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it. The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in. As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer. There should be some way to fix it when it pops out. Definitely would not reccommend it. To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept."
1,TRY A DIFFERENT ONE!,My son hasn't even slept in his new big bed yet and I already don't like this contraption! It's so cumbersome! It takes a college degree just to lock it into place and a whole lesson in rocket science to fold it down. I see no way to keep the bed looking nice and made when my son is not sleeping - and I can't even begin to think how terrible putting sheets on the bed with this thing will be. I'm taking it back tomorrow! I'm not even going to bother trying it out. I'm already frustrated! I'd probably throw the thing out a window if I had to keep it! What ever happened to the bed rails that just folded up and down flat against the side of the bed!? It wasn't all that long ago I babysat a boy who had one - where have they gone?
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I bought this bed rail because I liked the fact that it secured on top of the mattress. I felt this was a safer alternative to the bed rails I have used in the past that slide out from the mattress making it possible for children to become lodged in between the mattress and the bed rail.This product was very simple to assemble and seemed sturdy until I tried to put it on my daughter's bed. After locking it into position, all it would take is a simple nudge and it would disengage.I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend purchasing it."
1,NO GOOD!!!,"First of all Safety 1st's claim that this rail is for mattresses up to 10 inches thick is WRONG! We first tried it on a new mattress for my son (9 inches thick) and there was no way this thing would fit. After repeated tries we finally tried it on a thinner, older mattress (6 inches thick) and it took my husband leaning with all his weight repeatedly for this thing to fit! Forget about having to go thru this everytime I need to change the sheets!! Bottom line: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,"Strong product, very safe.","I love this rail. My son used it and it stayed put so well, it left indents in the bed. It is very strong. I had no bad dealings with this at all. I recommend it to anyone. Very worth the money. When I bought it, it was the only one available and I didn't want to pay the price for something that was only used a little while, but it was very worth it. Thank you Safety First."
1,Didn't care for this bedrail,"I completely understand why there are so many negative reviews for this bedrail. The first problem is that it takes up about 6 inches off of the mattress. The second problem is that to lock it in place you have to significantly squeeze the mattress. (After continued use this will definitely damage the mattress.) Third, it takes a lot of effort to put it up and down (for changing sheets, etc.). I am going to return this and look for another bedrail."

1,Don't Bother - cheap felt,"Felt layout is a decent purchase for the money. It came in original packaging, although it seems to have gotten warm enough to fade/smudge some of the printing. Blackjack/Craps layouts look good, red color is a little too dark to read from a distance. Felt I received is darker green than pictured and Red/Black are not as vibrant. After a few weeks of play, the felt is already starting to wear. It starts balling and shedding green felt fluffs and looks pretty bad. I wouldn't recommend this product and i'm going to have to replace it with something else."
2,Wrong item shipped,"The product itself was fine. However, I ordered the Blackjack on one side and the Roulette on the other. In my order history, I can clearly see that this is what I ordered. And yet when the order was fulfilled, the product was changed to Blackjack on one side and craps on the other. Not sure if the vendor changed the product description after the fact or what. I only know that this was not what I ordered."
5,Now that's awesome!,"From the moment I first heard Dorkfish at a friend of my dad's, I was an instant fan. I loved the Here's your Sign routine, not memerly because it made me laugh so hard that my ribs ached, but also because now that I've heard it, I realize that I agree wholeheartedly with it. I myself have had encounters with quite a few people who would've gotten signs if I'd had them to give. An example was the time I was bell ringing for the Salvation army, and a woman walked up to me and asked if I was with the Salvation Army. ""No,"" I said, ""I'm with the FBI."" But that's getting off track. Some of my favorite bits on this CD are Snake in the Toilet, Pads, Smoker Aquarium and the requisite Here's your Sign. Of course the Shoulda Shut Up song at the end is another favorite of mine since I firmly believe that most guys, yes myself included, don't know when to shut up when we're talking to women."
5,Some of Engvall's best,"I became a fan of Bill Engvall upon hearing his segment of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour album. Since I like to listen to stand-up albums while I drive, within a month I'd purchased all four of his full-length albums -- this one, I think, is my favorite. The title routine, ""Now That's Awesome,"" delves into a topic that bugs me (the misuse of language) and then goes on into some typical Engvall wacky examples. The stories about his kids (the son making him laugh, the daughter taking surfing lessons) are all great and bring the humor into a real universal context. Engvall is a real ""everyman"" comedian, except he's funnier than most of us.And lest we forget, this album does include the requisite ""Here's Your Sign"" routine and comedy/country musical tracks. These won't particularly stand out from the similar bits on his other albums, but they're still just as good here. All in all, a great CD that I listen to often."
1,GG,"I got two of the Gypsy Moth Traps for the work place which I work at a telescope. These traps did not catch any moths. Not one. So my recommendation is that these are not worth buying. Keep your money, buy a zapper."
1,Worthless,Didn't catch a thing except my $$$. Bought a bug zapper and it's working great for moths even though some say they don't work.
1,"Did not find it well done, or for beginners","Being already trilingual, I thought this would be good to help me with at least the basics of German. Total waste of money."
2,Heavily biased drivel,"Although the author claims in the forward that he is merely relaying these conspiracies and has no opinion, his extremely biased opinion is starkly apparent throughout. Additionally, some of the accounts are relayed using blanket statements without a source or explanation as to how the conclusion was arrived at. If a particular conspiracy did not fit the political views of the writer, it was vehemently attacked. If it did, many crucial points were glossed over. According to this book, the CIA, FBI, and the Mafia, have been the root of all evil during the 20th Century"
3,"Not for people with sight problems, not unisex either","I bought this watch to my sister, who is forty-something and is starting to have sight shortages. Since the watch never fits the center and it is always hanging around (which she finds annoying) and given it is too tiny, her possibilities to actually used it as a watch and not as a wrist-chain are quite null.I goes without saying that I do not thing such a small and delicate watch is not very appropriate for men but that would all be a matter of style."
4,A sense of beauty in everyday reality,"Stein is not a systematic thinker or writer. He essentially reflects on his own experience in confronting works of art and literature. He is very much under the influence of William James and American pragmatist. He does thus see the beauty present in everyday worlds. He is an extremely intelligent, learned and sensitive person He writes of the appreciative mind which finds similarities , and sees differences only where they can add to the whole. He contrasts this appreciative mind with the scientific mind that looks to break up things and find differences among them. His whole effort in the work is to appreciate painting, poetry and prose, the beauties of the world."
1,Remakes just arent the same,"Great variety of songs I grew to love, but sadly this compilation is made up of remakes of the originals. It definitely doesn't have the nostalgic sound of my memories."
5,A look at our past through the camera of a genius.,"The genius of Darius and Tabitha Kinsey becomes clear early on in this book. Mr. Kinsey roamed the Pacific Northwest, visiting logging camps and homesteads to photograph the people there. All photographs are make on glass plates ranging in size from 8""x10"" to 20""X24"". Plates were shipped back to Tabitha who would develop them and make prints which Darius would sell to the subjects. On one level, these are formal portraits of working men, women and their machines. And yet, the humanity of every subject somehow shines through. These are not faces staring into a camera lens. These are people caught in a moment, telling us of their lives from times long past. The photographs can stand alone or be viewed as a history of life in hard times"
4,High Quality Video,I was surprised at the quality of the video footage on this DVD of live performances at the SXSW in 2007. IT's the highest video quality I've seen on a concert footage. The editing was done well also. Nothing more irratating than to have the guitarist break in to a lead and the camera still on the singer. The interviews could have been better but my interest was on the live performance of the bands. The DVD is worth the money.
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!,"This was NOT what I was hoping for. I did take a gamble purchasing it because I really hoped it had OZOMATLI's concert at the Bat Bar. However, the description was vague and I lost my gamble! My husband has not even watched it and it was Christmas gift Dec 07."
5,brit-core's finest hour,"From 1987 to 1994 british music pioneers created a new sound to hip-hop , this sound was called brit-core. This type of hip-hop was made up of 100bpm breaks and ragga style mcing. The highlight of it was gunshots patriot games. From start to end this was a classic."
5,A worthy reader of a worthy book,"""Farmer Giles of Ham"" is vintage Tolkien encapsulated. Ham is a farmer who owns a cowardly dog named Gorm. The two of them set out to dispose of a dragon named Chrysophylax who is terrorizing the shire. They do defeat Chrysophylax, but how? Well, you have to listen to Sir Derek Jacobi (best known in the USA as the stammering Emperor Claudius in the Masterpiece Theatre series of the '70s; also as Brother Cadfael in The Cadfael Mysteries) read you the story, as he does with the same elegance he brings to all his performances. Sir Derek is a true master of the spoken word. The combination of a writer like Professor Tolkien and a reader like Sir Derek is truly rare and wonderful. And the delight does not stop with ""Farmer Giles""; the stories in this little book abound with imagination and excellence."
4,Eye popping colors!!!!!,"If you catch this exhibit in London, you will be amazed at how many of the photos you will recognize not knowing who the photographer was. No wonder Princess Diana allowed only one man to catch her as she truly was, simply a woman. The fashion shots and ad campaigns are great. His celebrity photos are ok, but Testino is fashion and that is where his best work lie. In either b&w or color, these photos speak!!"
1,Could live without it. Great seller. Useless book.,The photos are too large for each page.It's a boring book of fashion photos; editorial and advertising.Better books out there. Expensive for what it is.Seller is Great. Used book in Excellent condition.
4,Gorgeous and Raw Testino,"Portraits of the Peruan Photographer Mario Testino introduces all enthusiats and photographers to a very exquisite concept of handle of colors, pictures in bath suits. Saturation and well done make up are also avaliable on this unremarcable publication. Very into the fashion world."
1,Remove this GARBAGE from government property NOW!,"The decalogue has NO BUSINESS existing in ANY FORM on court buildings, schools, anywhere MY tax dollars are being spent. TAKE THEM DOWN! TAKE THEM ALL DOWN! America will NEVER be turned into a religious DICTATORSHIP. ""One Nation Under God?"" I DON'T THINK SO."
1,Looked and sounded ok when it worked,"I bought this radio a year ago and have had problems with it on and off ever since. The sound quality is ok for the size, but not $300 worth. There are very few knobs so it looks good, but I did not find the controls intuitive and had to refer to the manual every time I needed to do something. Someitmes it finds HD radio stations and sometimes it doesn't. It regularly freezes and the only fix is to unplug it and plug it in again. Which is ok unless you were relying on the alarm clock function to wake you up. I would not recommend it."
1,Don't buy this turkey,"Sound is good, features are OK, HD audio is so-so. The killer is the IC2 Float error. I'm unable to play from my portable media player, as just when I go to sleep, the radio will give a load beep, and shut down. At this point, the display will indicate 'IC2 Float'. The radio must be unplugged and plugged back in to clear the fault. Sometimes this causes the presets to be erased. Recently, it is getting worse, affecting the radio too, almost every night. This is a serious design flaw, and Cambridge should be taken to task for producing such garbage. Don't buy it, at any price."
4,Works fine,Perfect for the kitchen counter. Perfect to listen to the content on the Internet. Works for me.
4,fun,"Peach girl 7 has left me in a place in the storie that I don't know where it's going to go from here, this is probly the most on the edge of my seat since I started it."
3,Demystifying but not thorough.,"I was disappointed that this book included practically nothing on the actual SMSC handshaking and protocols, nor about actual SMS, EMS, or MMS specifications, etc.. The book seems geared very much towards management types who are trying to decide whether or not to implement mobile messaging in their business strategy. The history of SMS and case studies of successful text messaging business implementations get focus. It is not a practical reference for an actual developer and provides next to nothing in technical information."
4,I like it!,"I like this album. It is a little pop, a little jazz and a little I-don't-know-what. Nothing spectacular but easy listening for the end of a long, sucky day."
2,True Review,Start off i'm a big Jay fan. But for his standard this is poor . Songs are too short lacked jay's trademark funk beats but i admit great lyrics. All i can say is thank God for Vol.2 Hardknock Life. When under pressure he handled his business and 4 more classic albums.
1,DAMN!!,"This album is straight trash! Period. This a horrible album by an extremely average rapper. Yes I said it. I mean I just don't get it . Will somebody please fill me in on what is so great about Jay-Z. I will say this, ""Reasonable Doubt"" was his best album and even that wasn't a classic, but it did come close. Blueprint was a solid album worthy of about 4 stars. ""The Black Album"" was a descent album worthy of about 3.5 to 4 stars. All his other albums are grade A trash. Just to think this guy is considered to a great. Don't make me laugh. This guy talks about the same thing over and over and over. It makes my head hurt. His subject matters are so tiring, not to mention his flow is terrible. If you want some real emcees check out this people: 2Pac, Nas, Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Eminem, Big L, Outkast, and Jadakiss just to name a few."
1,this album is weak,"Yo i am a big fan of jayz vol.2 and all the releases since but this album is disappointing and depression. It is real week like jt money week it does not sound good at all. The only good track is sunshine by foxy brown(fine black woman). If u want true ghetto gold then u have to check out billy guliman with one voice and christmas classic. This is one my five wackist album list with jt - money blood sweet and years, ugk - dirty money, mac - world war 3, c-murder - trapped in crime and garth brooks - standing outside the fire cd single.keep it real homie"
2,this ain't jigga man material,"Reasonable Doubt was probably the best CD Jay-Z ever put out so we all expected In My Lifetime to be just as good or better right?? WRONG. With 1 less track then Reasonble Doubt (not that it matters) this CD just doesn't sound good coming out of an extremly talented rapper, even the beats aren't really that good. If you want to hear this CD don't buy, download it or just download ""A Million and One Questions (the intro), city is mine, and where i'm from and those are the best songs on the CD, if there is any. I think if Jay stuck with the same formula he used in reasonable doubt in all of his CDs we wouldn't be hearing junk like Blueprint 2 or In my lifetime."
2,worst album,"Of all of the Jay-Z albums, this one would be the one to ignore. But, don't trust me, look up the reviews."
4,The last record of the real Jay-Z,"I always wonder what happened to Jay-Z! From starting as one of the srongest lyric writer he seemed to be equal with 2Pac, Biggie, Rakim and Nas. But nowadays he just rhymes about money, ice, fashion, etc in all different ways. This record is for me one of the most personal records in hip hop history and it consits of incredibale beats. This one represents a young cat, hungry for admiration and just a good beat to spite some lyrics over it. This was the Jay-Z who loves Hip-Hop for itself and than for the money. But nowadays it is just only money. THe lyrics are week, the beats are rubbish. If one wants to get the real Jay-Z, buy his debut and this one, and one will see what real hip-hop is all about."
4,"Good, too much cussing, good flow,, nice beats","Sounds like good music that Jay-Z would come with, beats are fluent and the lyrics are fresh"
2,Disapointing,"I like Jay-Z but this album was a huge let down.""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""It's A Hard Knock Life"" were much better.Only buy if you're a die hard Jay-Z fan"
1,Why,Jay-Z is one of my favorite rappers but this is crap. Back in 97 people knew this was crap but as the years went on it got more and more credit while Vol 2 got less as well as Vol 3. this album has boring simple beats and stupid lyrics about girls mostly. The only good songs are friend foe and streets is watching peace.
5,A Flawless Album,"Many fans probably think Jay-Z's best album was Volume 2, but thats only because they dont have volume 1. Every track on this cd was carefully built on great lyrics and solid beats. When listening to this album, I dont skip over any songs, they are all above average at worst. The songs make you think and appreciate Jason Carter's flow. ""Where I'm From"" and ""Sunshine"" are my personal favorites, two songs that never really hit mainstream but are worth the price of a cd by themselves. If you have Jay-Z volume 2 or 3, I would recommend that you find this one as well, because its better than both of those. Buying this album is like buying a classic, because its excellent rapping that will always be good."
2,WOW this is Jay-Z worst cd,this cd isnt good there is only 1 good song thats rapgame/crack game if u want a good Jay-Z cd buy In my life time vol..3 or reasnoable doubt
3,Too Much Potential,"Jay-Z has dropped a good album, however it is not nearly up to the standards of what he set for himself in Reasonable Doubt. While songs like ""Lucky Me"", ""Real Niggaz"", and ""Immaginary Players"" are some great tracks songs like ""SUnshine"", ""I Know What Girls Like"" and ""City Is Mine"" are average and screaming for radio play. If any other artist had put our Vol. 1 then it would be great but when someone is as talented as Jay-Z then we, the consumer expect more. I would say buy it only because it is Jay-Z and 60% of the CD is good and while so much garbage (ie No Limit, Puff Daddy, Canibus) is comming out it's good to see a CD which is above average."
3,Jay-Z Vol. 1,"Definitely not his best album but it went platinum. The beats are hot. The way the lyrics are uttered is creative. You get contributions from Backstreet, Babyface, Foxy Brown, Lil' Kim, and of course P.Diddy who made the beats for most of the album. Check out the first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, and thirteenth tracks. 12 of the songs have been sampled though from even other rappers' songs!"
3,Def Jam's influence,"The influence of being on a mainstream label keep jay-z from releasing a classic the second time out. reasonable doubt came out on priority records which cares less about marketing and image they let you do you. Def Jam has the power to say ""your album is too street. go record me a pop song"" and if you dont do it they shelve you. Personaly i feel jay-z would never colaborate with p. diddy (i feel def jam accessed that). but this album does have classic songs(a million and one question, streets is watching, you must love me, real niggaz and where im from) but classic songs dont make classic albums. Babyface on a track (No, def jam influenced), that ""the city is mine"" (No). this is actually jay-z crossing over to pop silently. DO NOT FORGET, I FEEL I AM JAY-Z'S NUMBER ONE FAN BUT HE SHOULD BE ASHAME OF HISSELF FOR RELEASING THIS."
1,STOP,"IN MY LIFETIME I HAVE SEEN GARBAGE, HUSTLERS/DEALERS WHO PIMPED THE HIP HOP CULTURE.... HAD NO TALENT, BUT BUSINESS SENSE. THIS IS IT FOLKS...... THAT NO TALENT CAT I WAS TALKIN BOUT.. STOP THE WACKNESS.. ALL A YALL.. YALL SHOULD BE A SHAMED OF YOURSELVES.. YALL PLAYED HIP HOP LIKE SOME HOE! SAD VERY SAD.... CHILDREN.. JAY Z HAS N O TALENT.. WHAT SO EVER! LISTEN TO BIG DADDY KANE OR ERIC B. & RAKIM FOR SOME CLASSES ON STLYE AND FINESS... THIS IS WACKNESS.. THE WACKNESS MONSTER REALLY...STOP THE MADNESS.. THE RAPPER GETS PAYED, BUT YALL GET PLAYED! NO MORALS OR VALUES, ALL MONEY AND 15 SECOND BROTHERS WHO CAN'T STAND WOMEN.. PLEASE...STOP!NO STARS!"
4,Just Like Nas,"""In My Lifetime"" was truly a great follow-up to his underrated classic album ""Reasonable Doubt"". Coming back at a time that was quite horrible(Death of Biggie Smalls), Jay-Z still managed to bring forth an album that was true to his roots. With songs like: ""A Million And One Questions/Rhyme No More"", ""Imaginary Player"", ""Streets Is Watching"", ""Rap Game/Crack Game"", and ""Where I'm From"" IN MY LIFETIME was semi-classic..."
5,Dopeness,"1997 was the last year of hip-hop's golden era. I bought this CD back in 1998 and it's still in my rotation today. The album kicks of with Premo's One In A Million/Rhyme No More joint. This album has so many highlights, but I won't go into them all. The only thing about this CD I didn't like was Track 3 with Puffy and Sunshine, but joints like Imaginary Player, Streets is Watching, and Where I'm From completely make up for it. This album was right before Jay-Z decided to turn into Jiggaman and H to the Izzo. Don't get me wrong, he still makes good/great songs, he just can't seem to make good/great albums anymore (exception Blueprint LP). Oh yeah, it's funny how ""the real Jay-Z fans"" haven't had a chance to review this CD huh."
4,A Lifetime Collection,"Jay-Z, Jigga, Jahova or whatever you call him he have what you're looking for. The moment I got to track 3 ""I Know What Girls Like"" it has been well worth picking this up. For a successful artist, ghostwriter and business man, I was glad to hear ""Imaginary Player"". This song he goes for the throat to all emcees/rappers that talk that bling, bling talk by questioning where's all that you say in your rhymes. On this release you can finish listening to the previous release ""Who You Wit II"" with an extra verse. In My Lifetime goes through his life and Jay's accomplishments. ""You Must Love Me"" is probably the best song ever recorded by Jigga that no one pays attention to. The ""Face Off"" featuring Sauce Money is a great collaboration how the both of them oppose all competitors, including women. As a great comparison of ""Rap Game/Crack Game"" in conclusion I'll tell you this...In My Lifetime, Vol.1 is dope!"
5,One of Jay-Z's Best!,"What's so lackluster about this album? This is Jigga's follow up to the classic Reasonable Doubt and it is almost just as good. This album demonstrates The Old School & Street Jay-Z. Highlights include ""Intro/A Million Questions/Rhyme No More"", ""City Is Mine"", ""Imaginary Player"" and ""Where I'm From."" Every track is tight and grooving. Even the below par tracks like ""I Know What Girls Like"" and ""Lucky Me"" still catch the listener's ear. Underated greatness! Go cop it!"
4,Sharp,"Be sharp when you read this one. Everything is connected in some way and history is not static. What does baking pies in modern day New Hampshire have to do with kids skipping stones in the 1938 and the Vietnam War? All I have to say is, be nice to your kids because you may need them to go back in time and drag you out of a Southeast Asian jungle."
5,Top notch black metal,"In a world that's filled with gay music, it's nice to know you can always depend on Enthroned. My opinion: The best black metal money can buy. It's a shame they are so underrated. I am glad in a way because it ensures that they will never sell out or compromise. This is their debut album (with the exception of the 7"" Scared By Dark Winds EP) and is produced much better than early Emperor. The crown in black metal truly belongs to Enthroned. HAIL!"
4,A different take on Blade,"Important to note if buying this DO NOT also buy Blade: House of Chthon. That is included in the complete series as the two part opener. Moving on Fingaz is no Snipes. But ther stories are strong. The supporting cast is actually better than most of the movies. Except of course Kris Kristofferson, he's the man! BUt the series is far better than Blade Trinity, but not as good as the first two Blade movies. Interesting side note, there are topless women in the tv show, but there were never any in the movies... odd."
5,Blade The Series - The Complete Series,Awesome TV Show - better than the movies. Wish they had made Season 2
2,Seriously??? Big let down.,Had high hopes for this show & it let me down. Week Lead actor!!!! Or perhaps bad directing. Bad writing & editing. Leaves you hanging at the end. I can't go on about how bad this series was anymore. Anyway this purchase was a waste of money for me & will trade in asap. Blade 1 & 2 were great!!!
3,Not bad (if you're a fan),"The guy who plays Blade (Kirk Jones) doesn't do too bad a job. He looks the part, but definitely isn't Wesley Snipes. Snipes had the presence that really made the overacting just right, but this guy doesn't quite hit the mark. Jill Wagner is as annoying as all hell, but she's obviously there as eye candy. You could make a drinking game out the number of times they find an excuse to show her in a state of undress...Still, it's good to see that they didn't try to make it kiddie friendly and that's it definitely intended for an adult audience. If they ever decide to kick off a second season, I would hit that as well."
1,Boo!,"a total disappointment. this tv series was totally horrible in terms of production (seems to have a very low budget)and a silly story line.this one has nothing to compare with the movie series, which i loved. it got boring and boring as it progressed.what a waste of a great franchise"
2,A Disappointment!!,I am a big fan of Blade (I was born ready m@#$@# f$##$)but this series is a down grade for the original Blade.Stick with the movies and Leave (Sticky) blade series!I give 2 stars because of the name only...
4,Hey- it was fun stuff!,"Look- Blade the Series was great guilty pleasure fare. Comparisons between a film with $90,000,000 budget to create 90 minutes of air time and a TV show that spent less for an entire series is a bit foolish. It was fun and now its gone and thats a shame."
2,Cute but not sturdy,The canopy is nice and looks good. I used it one time during the summer month. The canopy fell over and bent. Wasn't able to use again.
1,10 x 10 Pop-up BLUE Canopy w/4 Side Walls EZ to set up,Took the EZ up out to the river and had fun wiith it for two days until the wind knocked it over on the 2nd day and broke the frame. Tried to fold it back up in the rain/wind but wasn't able to....already bent out of shape...(just lost $100)
1,Poor construction materials used,"We were very sad and disappointed after the first use, one of the pieces in the top, which is flimsy as a curtain rod, broke at the point where a screw was inserted. I have since gone to stores and looked at other models which are made with much stronger materials. Several people were inpressed and we were delighted until the second time we tried to set the unit up. It costs $63.00 to buy a replacement rod for the one that snapped, at what look like a construction flaw. I was stupid to not check on the warranty before purchasing. I now understand why there is none, this is a flimsy waste of my money. We now must purchase another unit which is made of better materials, maybe if you did not plan on setting up and taking down this unit often it would be a good buy, but that did not meet our needs."
1,cheap not well made,"you would think something this heavy would be better made, for one the bag didnt have wheels, it was so heavy the straps that it did have started to tear when i took it to my car, set up easy however the wind blew it over,no big deal we picked it up and tried to collapse it to pack up and a few bars were went out of shape, VERY THIN FRAGILE metal, it took 4 people & nearly a hour ( luckily the campers next to use helped) tocollapse it since it wasnt bending right related to bend polls. so its heavy and cheaply made."
3,Moderately funny,"Well, it had to happen. This slim tome lampoons the verysuccessful ""For Dummies"" series. Each chapter sends upa different book in the series with more or less success.The Sex for Dummies chapter was quite funny, while theInternet for Dummies chapter was pretty lame (even lamerthan the original, if I do say so my rather biased self.)Even so, at under eight bucks it's a fine stocking stufferfor any Dummies lover."
1,This book is not funny and a waste of time and money,"This book is not funny - a total waste of time and money. Poorly written, awkwardly constructed and riddled with humor not worthy of fifth graders. I do not know who these so-called writers are, but they are not humorists. Avoid at all costs"
2,A disappointment. I expected many more things,"The book has nice black and white photographs which capture many aspects of the typical Israeli soldier's life but the text is very poor and absolutely not engaging, to the point of being a major disappointment. If the photographs are not your main motive to buy a book, avoid this title and read the old but still good book ""A Portrait of the Israeli Soldier"" by Reuven Gal or any of the Israeli sodliers' memoirs published recently."
3,Good enough to add to the collection....,"I enjoyed it...but it is hard to follow one! and two!...yet it's a good enough to buy.... (priced low anyway)....so get it for your collection on...""TROIS""....."
3,So-So,"For the Trois series to be low budget films, I enjoyed the first two. However, The Escort did not do anything for me. It was an ok movie, but I felt that it was missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. Rent this movie it you can't get it for a bargain price."
3,My Review,I only bought this movie b/c i wan an extra in it and wanted to see myself on my big screen. It was pretty good though. it was filmed in my hometown and had a pretty good plot.
5,Perfect,"This is just the tote I was looking for. When making a scrapbook for my daughter's schoolwork, I overfilled it with pages so that it was too thick for the standard plastic storage boxes in craft stores. This was the perfect solution. Not only does it fit, but the handle makes it easy to carry when I want to take it somewhere, and the 3 file folders that are included are very convenient for adding extra paperwork that I couldn't fit into the book. The top compartment was also handy for storing special small items from her childhood.This carrier may have been meant to be used while the scrapbook is in progress, but it's the perfect solution for storing it when you're finished."
5,This was one of the best ideas EVER!!,"This is an excellent case for anyone who scrapbooks! It is easy to carry and has some very convenient and surprising features, such as the small case that attaches to the top. I have 2 of them already, and thinking about getting a third."
4,Good,This is exactly what I wanted. I did give information to my friends so if they are interest. They will look for it also.
5,love it,This project is great for a scrapbooker that likes to go crops. The handles are great and it is easy to carry.
2,Totally GBA...,"It's basically a bad version of the GBA... and how did Nintendoget it to be this putrid?They made it require more expensive accesories...They made it only for NEW games...They made more easy-to lose parts...and they ruined their reputation this year. I advise you save upfor a Nintendo DS. All you need is a few game cards andyou're all set, because there is no batteries ( only a superconvenient charger ) and you can buy more styluses if you losethem!"
4,"Weird, small, and tons of fun even for adults","If you have tight pants, this is the portable game system for you. It's slim, it's tiny, and most people won't even know it's a game boy - they usually think I'm using a cell phone. That comes in handy if you're an adult and don't want people to know you're still addicted to Pokemon.The screen is incredibly bright compared to my old SP. The only down side is that there is no way to connect it to the Gamecube for certain games, like pokemon colosseum or Zelda: Four Swords - but if you look on wikipedia, you'll find some people have figured out a way to do this with some cables and solder."
4,great!,"The size and weight is wonderful. I really like the fact that I can take it anywhere with me and it won't take up too much space. It comes with everything you need so thats a good thing. The only thing that could have changed would be the size of the screen. It really could have been a bit bigger, but it's all good. Just becareful because you can only play gameboy advance games on this thing. However, I suggest you buy it if you don't mind."
4,Gameboy Micro,"This is a nice little device. It plays all the Gameboy Advance SP games and the screen is brighter than the Advance SP! The screen detail is also crisper, so it tends to compensate for the smaller screen size (I just hold it up closer...). The headphone jack is also a big plus! Very simple to operate, all in a small package that is perfect for the avid Gameboy consumer or ""closet gamer"" executive who wants something that is quick to use, & easy to hide, during those ""bored"" meetings!"
3,A Revolution with Major Setbacks,"For me, personally I don't recommend the game boy micro. There is not much difference between the GBA Sp (newer edition w/ backlit-2005)and the GB micro. The graphics are about the same, it's just that the micro is a bit better. You can carry a GBA Sp in your pocket just like the micro (It's better because you can fold it). Now if you have an older edition of the GBA Sp (without backlit-2001), then you would notice a dramatic difference in terms of graphics. The GBA Sp appears to be more durable and flexible as its square-like folded capability would not allow much damage compared to the micro's rectangular shape. The Sp will allow you to play all previous games and the sound is much more superb. Thus, I recommend the new version of the GBA Sp (the one with backlit and the graphics are magificent, just as equivalent to the micro) that comes in shiny, light blue or black."
3,"c'mon, nintendo, what's the point?","Ok, don't think that I'm some PSP fan who's come here to bash nintendo. This is a nifty little thing, but it's completely pointless! It's just another rehash of GBA. I'm pretty sure that every nintendo fan in the nation already owns a GBA or GBSP. What's the point it a GBM that plays the same games?I suggest you just pay the extra 30 bucks and get a Nintendo DS."
2,incompatibility with classic Game Boy games turns me off,"The Game Boy Micro may have the best screen any Game Boy has ever had, and the system itself may be the perfect size for people on the go, but Nintendo made one cardinal error with the design and release of the Game Boy Micro : The Game Boy Micro is incompatible with classic Game Boy/Game Boy Color games. To me, a Game Boy which is incompatible with classic Game Boy/Game Boy Color games is no Game Boy. Instead, I would go with the Game Boy Advance SP because you get a backlit screen (which the Game Boy Micro offers as well) as well as compatibility with all classic Game Boy/Game Boy Color games (which the Game Boy Micro does NOT offer). Because of its incompatibility with classic Game Boy/Game Boy Color games, I cannot recommend the Game Boy Micro."
3,A GIANT LOAD OF ****!!!,"UGH! THIS IS JUST A GAME BOY ADVANCED ONLY SMALLER!!! WHAT'S THE ****ING DEAL. YOU CAN FIND NORMAL GAME BOY ADVANCED SYSTEMS FOR $20 LESS. SO... WHAT... YOU'D REALLY PAY 20 EXTRA BUCKS JUST SO IT CAN BE SMALLER AND MORE UNCOMFORTABLE TO HANDLE!!! GET THE SP OR THE NORMAL ONE. BETTER YET, GET THE DS!!! THIS IS JUST LIKE IPOD WITH ORIGINAL, MINI (GOOD SIZE), AND FINALLY... THE NANO. (WHAT THE ****) THE REASON I GAVE THIS ****ING SYSTEM A 3 INSTEAD OF A 1, IS BECAUSE IT'S FUN... BUT JUST GET THE ORIGINAL, OKAY?!"
2,heres what i think,"Will nintendo ever make a new gameboy? im sooo sick of these new looks!! i want a new game boy with new games, better graphics, etc. now dont get me wrong, theres nothing bad about the micro, it looks cool, it controls well, it has a nice screen, its just too far behind its time."
2,Nintendo Made A Big Mistake,"It's a pint-sized game boy advance SP. That's all I will say. Their Nintendo DS is a real work of art, but this is ridiculous."
2,Hated It,Big fat F for Nintendo that is all I can say. I am now a former Micro owner and a current PSP owner.
1,No I Am Not Giving Nintendo Another $100.00,"I bought the SP and I liked it. But now they want me to give more money for a Game Boy that looks like they made it in 13 minutes. I want new games, new style, and a system that will keep me a loyal Nintendo fan. I know it might sound like ranting to some but I just want simple stuff. Thank You."
2,Nice size but not very cooooool,"dont buy it 1.the screen is small 2. not compatible with gb,or gbc games(which i really like) 3.can get stolen or lost. if you like the gbc or gb games dont buy this but i recommend it for the gamers who like playing the old games and i have to say nice faceplates but dont buy it if you like old games."
1,This made my sister cry.,I gave it to her as a gift and she broke down in tears. She said it lacked sleekness and a new form of games. I can't blame her. She may have over reacted but now I will save up AGAIN and buy her a PSP or iPod Shuffle or something. They took her birthday and her joy and now I am taking my money back.
5,Perfect for those in love with tiny electronics.,"This is just a miniature device for playing Gameboy Advance games. To some that might sound pointless, but if you don't have your old Advance lying around or you happen to want a tiny, pocket-sized device, then this is for you. It's not anything other than what it claims to be: a tiny game boy advance. I love the size and the portability. I bought it to play Pokemon Leaf Green and it is great. I can play the game entirely with only one hand and it slips into my pocket when I'm on the go.If you want a tiny GB Advance and you don't mind the price tag, then go for it. However, if you think it is too expensive or ""pointless"" then save your money. There are cheaper options out there, such as buying a used GB Advance SP, but no other handheld system offers such a sleek and tiny package."
5,I love my micro!,"I love the compact size of the gameboy micro. The faceplates are cute, although they do get scratched up easily. I recommend keeping the little pouch the micro comes with on at all times when you're not using it. And the battery life is great, I've had the gameboy micro for several years now and I still get several hours of battery life on one charge."
5,Cool,"This is a cool gameboy but doesn't live up to the potental it had, that is becuase it was released after the DS phat, so why would people buy the worse product of the two ( gameboy micro ) , they knew not many games would now be made foy the gameboy plus it wasn't even backwards playable!!! ( can't play gameboy original or color games ) so the people still with color or original games couldn't use it to it's full!!! It's a awsome system don't get me wrong but nintendo made a bad desition that's all, though they later said that it was only a backup system for if the DS didn't sell. The gameboy advance micro is a great system and is the last type of gameboy made and I think you should buy it!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Ballyk fans - stick to the programme.,"Ok. I absolutely adore the programme and I love and respect all the actors and actresses and the writers etc. but the book was a letdown. That's all I have to say. There was not at all enough detail, not even when explaining the whole of the sexual tension thing which was going on.I advise evryone to just stick to the tv programme. It was a lot more descriptive. But, hey if you are a true fan like me you would enjoy the book anyway. I would not advise the book to anyopne who hasn't watched the seiries."
5,"Good read, a nice reflection of the series",It is a very good story. It reflects the series. The only thing that lacks from the televeision series is the sight jokes. The book tells the story and the feeling of the storybook town and its inhabitants.
1,Not for the Rear like stated...,I'm upset at amazon for this one. labeled for rear but this is for the front. Part number from ventshade states rear. Not worth the time or stress to return. one of the few times I'm upset with the amazon product description not living up to the product.
1,didn't fit truck,The product says it fits my 2012 Toyota truck but it doesn't. I broke it trying to put it on so I can't return it. Double check with mfg before purchasing
1,Not even close.,"These deflectors didn't even come close to fitting my 2006 Toyota Tacoma. I read the instructions carefully and they simply do not come close to fitting. Whatever vehicle these were made to fit, it's not a 2006 Toyota Tacoma."
5,An untold story,"As someone who was too young to experience ""Trudeaumania"", this book gives me a lot of insight into who Trudeau was and also who were the men and women behind the scenes of those Liberal governments that changed Canada.As someone who grew up during the Mulroney and Chretien governments, it made me yearn to be a little older so I could experience what happened during that tumultuous times.Trudeau was an enigma wrapped in a riddle and this book does an amazing job in conveying that story and passion that drove him."
4,I have rarely read a political bio. of such depth and scope,"While I, as an American, do not have the intimate knowledge that a Canadian of my age would have of the times, this biography of Trudeau gives me an insight both into the character and career of Pierre Elliot Trudeau and into this era of Canadian political history. Trudeau's fights within and without the Liberal party and against those who changed the Quiet Revolution into the politics of succesion are engrossing and fascinating. Also striking is the way that the Canadian (and European) study of political economy, as opposed to American political science, gives one a greater insight into the times and the economic forces at work in the political sphere. The only reason that I didn't give this five stars is because I don't feel qualified to judge Canadian political scholarship."
3,Weaker albums by Wishbone Ash,"I had the earlier albums by the band and so when I saw this I picked it up. While the songs are OK, they lack the magic of the earlier albums - magic created by prog, metal, or folk-rock leanings, by harmony guitars and vocals, by great lead guitar, by epic and mythical leanings in the lyrics (particularly on Argus), by melodic up-front basslines, etc. What we're left with is generic 70s soft-rock, where the musicians mostly serve as a backing to weak vocals. Where the band had used harmony vocals to great effect on earlier albums, here they sing songs that a great singer might pull off but where the band's vocalists sound too light. The vocals work on the softer songs better, but I'm not so big a fan of that mid-70s soft rock sound! There are some good songs here, ""Rest In Peace"", ""Runaway"", ""Outward Bound"" - but they're not as excellent and distinctive as the band's earlier work."
4,Good Basic Reference,"I selected this atlas for my entire class to use because it is simple, colorful, and has just enough info. Two main reasons I chose it were that the price was right. The price of every other atlas I looked at placed them out of my budget. The main reason I like this atlas is that the maps are all printed on a single page. I do not like it when maps are split across the two pages, making them difficult to read. I have used an earlier edition of this atlas, and am in the process of replacing those books with this updated version. You really can't beat the price and the usefulness of this atlas. I recommend it for grades four through eight."
3,Getting air into the sausage,"It honestly seemed to stuff just as fast with the machine off, and the poorly-fitting plunger pushed huge amounts of air through the stuffer and into the sausage. Then I found the trick to getting it to work.Getting air out of the system is the only way to get the feed screw to work. The easiest way to do this is to work a drinking straw up and down the feed chute while gently pressing on the plunger. You'll feel the plunger drop as air escapes. Once the air's out, the stuffer will actually stuff pretty well. Keep working the straw as you go."
3,"Good, but not great.","If you're looking for a fantastic book, that details symbolism and much more more from C.S. Lewis' classic works, The Chronicles of Narnia, I suggest you try ""Journey Into Narnia"" by Kathryn Lindskoog or ""Companion to Narnia"" by Paul Ford. At times this book was boring and tended to drag along. Its a fine book, but others are better."
5,best deal on automotive belts I have ever seen.,"Guess they work just like any other belt, and at 10% of the carquest parts store price. I guess they have lots of overhead amazon does not, oh, and you got to love the free shipping"

3,Track listing,"I bought this album in 1994 after hearing Jason Bentley play the track ""I Dream Of Santiago"" on his KCRW radio program.

1,YOUR WRONG,"THIS IS THE SAME PERSON THAT WROTE EWWWWWWWWW. I DID OWN A MY SCENE DOLL, AND GUESS WHAT, I HATED IT.IT WAS UGLY AND HAD UGLY CLOTHES AND HAIR.AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE, I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T CARE.GUESS WHAT, THAT WAS MY OPINION TOO, SO YOU DEAL WITH IT.P.S. MY SCENE DOLLS SUCK AND YOU KNOW IT!!!!"
1,EWWWWWW,"THIS DOLL IS SO UGLY.

5,myscene rock,"myscene are the best. I dont know how people like bratz they are the ugliest thing in the world. They make me throw up when I see them. So face and give it up myscene are the best in the world and bratz suck.P.S bratz give me nightmares , scare me make me sick and mke me throw up"
2,im 12 years old and...,I boguth all the my scenes but i like the bratz better i mean the bratz clothes and their heads are a lot more detailed. i bought the two bratz hollywood and i asked my friends wich one they like the best they all said the...........Bratz so dont bother get this toy is is stupid and the hair frizzed on me
1,Why don't you people ever get it,"No, Bratz came out first, not My Scene dolls. Bratz came out in 2001, and My Scene dolls came out in 2002. And I have profe that Bratz are better. Well, did you know that for MTV awards, some celebrities get Bratz dolls. And when you first enter this website, go down to brands and you see Bratz on the list and no My Scene anywhere. Also, MGA Bratz won #1 fashion doll, #1 best selling toy, and #1 favorite brand 4 years in a row, and they were made 4 years ago. My Scene was only made 3 years ago. And they never won a award for anything. So Bratz were made first, not My Scene dolls. How could you not know that."
1,I DID take care of her,"I brushed her hair nice and gently and her hair wouldn't stop comeing out, and once again, I brush her hair nicely, and her head comes off, and I was easy on her clothes, and her outfits keep tearing. Not a good idea to have, don't get her or the rest."
1,bratz are better,"My Scene dolls suck. I don't get how people could think that they are pretty. They are uglier then anything I have ever seen. Now Bratz dolls, they are gorgeous. And they have better style and they are 10 times prettier, they aren't slutty like My Scene dolls, and my Scene dolls have big boobs and butts, they have messed up lips, and they are fat. I don't like them one bit. Bratz rule and My Scene drule."
5,Please stop the doll war between Bratz and my scene,"I hate how people fights about dolls.They are something just for fun.And I love this doll and I want her badly.She is gorgeous,and I love her hair.Bratz dolls are also good.The best collection is Ooh la la.So please stop the doll war.There is nothing important to fight about something plastic.Thank you!P.S.Morgan and Fairy tale princess must stop the doll war and go away."
5,I agree with you!! (The person who said Delancey should be included and all that),"I TOTALLY agree with you! Delancey is like no bigger a member of the My scene gang than Nolee is! She's my fave girl. She's like a really big part in the movie, and she has to be an Exclusive? I mean come on Mattel! I hope at LEAST they make MSGH Delancey exc. to TRU, bcuz I don't have Targets, so I was UNABLE to get MM Kenzie!! :( VERY dissapointed! So I hope I can find (eventually) MSGH Delancey!This doll is awesome by the way, and you should SO check out the MSGH mini site ::: http://myscene.everythinggirl.com/hollywood/hollywood.aspxPLEEEEASSSE STOP THE BRATZ/MY SCENE CONFLICT!!! They are just dolls! And who cares what Bratz lovers say on My Scene reviews! My Scene Fans aren't gonna read them, my scene haters!Thanx for reading!#1 My Scene Fan (I really am!)"
2,WATERLOGGED THRILLER,"SEA OF FEAR isn't a very suspenseful movie, folks. A group of seven people take a pleasure cruise, stop on some deserted island, reveal their darkest fears and then start getting murdered one by one.Edward Albert, Katherine Bailess and Christopher Showman ""headline"" the cast, but offer little in their performances to elevate the muddled, preposterous and twist-ridden plot. It's like TEN LITTLE INDIANS on a sailboat, but nowhere near as intriguing. This one sinks."
1,Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring,"Forget Rozerum. If your dreams miss you, try and watch this film. I woke up refreshed."
2,disappointed,"when i first saw it i was disappointed, leather was wrinkled, and nicked in spots, but when i tryed it on i was really disappointed, was not as comfortable as i thought it should be. will not buy this brand again."
5,****Best Portable DVD Player EVER!!!!,This is simply the best portable dvd player ever. I went through four different players before I found this gem.The screen is perfect and color/sound adjustable. I have had mine for about 5 years and it is still going strong. My only dissappointment is that now that I have been looking for a second screen I cannot find one because the company is out of business. It has hookups for a second screen but I cannot find one.If you ever run across one of these players don't think twice...buy it before it is too late!
2,a glorified hand warmer,"All I can say this ""heater"" is Nothing more than a glorified hand warmer! Using a thermometer in my garage, this thing did NOT raise it up one degree.I even left it on all night and sealed up my garage tight and after 12 hours no change in temp. at all! This thing would only keep you warm only if you sat on it!"
4,Good product!,I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 cause its not the best heater out there but it does the job. My dad loves using this in his shooting box.
4,Good tent heater,I used this during our last camping trip and it worked fine in our 6 person tent. We had it on for the whole night and the tent was warm. The outside temperature did not go as low as we expected but I think this heater is perfect as it provides just enough heat to keep the area warm. There is no apparent flame and when I almost touched it didn't burn my hand. I don't recommend touching it while in use but it seems to be very safe and well built.We have used it for one night and the canister has some gas left. I am assuming a single canister will last for few nights. The base is very stable and as long as there is a relatively flat area you don't need to worry about tipping it. The product guide says that it automatically switches off if tilted more than 45 degrees. I haven't tested this out but will do when we go camping again.
3,"Its, OKay","We bought this for the golf cart at out campground for the early spring, late fall and winter. We tried it the last of October, it did ok. I don't think it will put out enough to really warm the cart up, but it will knock the chill off. We have a cover on the cart as well."
4,Heat works good but ignition doesn't work,"The heater works well, but I was only able to get the ignition to work once(the first time I used it). Now, I use a lighter and that seems to be fine."
5,Nice Little Heater,"This little heater is very nice. It is a lower output unit, so it has its limitations its power, but that is clearly noted in the description. I wanted a small heater that was lightweight enough that I could put it in my hiking pack for very cold nights to deal with the bitter cold. It can heat a moderate size tent well enough. I am very pleased. I agree with the advice of breaking it in and burning off the initial smell. It is an interesting smell at first."
3,Let me down,Wanted to use this for snow camping in my small tent. Burned a tank of propane before the trip to get rid of the smells. Used it to warm the tent before going to bed. Did not use it the following morning because it was not really cold. The second morning it would not light inside the tent - worked fine outside but that defeats the purpose. It must have some type of low oxygen sensor but I could not find any mention of one.
1,Not enough heat output,"I have purchased several of these portable heaters over the years for tents, cars, trucks, and boats. This one was the most disappointing. I was in a car that broke down in Southern Ohio one winter night. I could barely feel the heat from this heater inside. I had some blankets which kept me warm until morning when someone came by. This heater is useless."
3,It is ok,There is not alot of heat output. The heat cannot be adjusted. There is only on or off. The ingniter does not work very ofen.
4,Coleman SportCat with Instastart,"I purchased this unit to use in my deer stand in Minnesota this November. Overall I was pleased. The unit did smell terribly at first. I would strongly suggest burning a canister in the outdoors before you actually go out and use it in a tent or any enclosed area to burn off the smell. On a windy day it did take a little bit of effort to start but on the norm it started nicely. Once started the unit put off heat and stayed lit no matter in the wind or not. Being that I was using it in an open area, not enclosed, I probably could have used a bit more BTU's. I later used it in an enclosed area and was impressed with the warmth it provided. I was impressed by the fact that it is extremely quiet, portable, easy to start, and efficient."
4,"Handy for tent, hunt blind, or car!","Very satisfied to date. Yes it smelled bad at first, but only for about half a tankful. The auto-lighter works very well, and has never required more than two clicks, often lights on first click.I really like the compact size. It's easy to carry around, and I'll keep it in the car this winter in case I get stranded. It won't heat a room, but does well in small spaces if kept close-by.Only negative to this item is that you can't angle it to direct the heat, so I have to prop it against another object (and keep an eye on it so nothing gets burned down!). In ""normal"" operation, the base is very steady, but remember to pull out 4 fins out!"
4,Works very well,"After a week-long camping trip, this heater managed to keep the tent warm all night. The base is sturdy and we had no fear of it tipping over.Still, it would have been nice to have had one that used a fan!"
4,Well-written bio of an interesting guy,"Dampier was a fascinating person, a real live buccaneer and also one of our first naturalists. Since I like buccaneers and naturalists, he works well for me. The book is fun to read and well-researched. I dug it.If you're into books about explorers, you can check out my list - imaginatively titled ""Books about explorers"" - for a few more recommendations."
5,A Great Read and a Good Reference,"This account of the life and times of William Dampier is refreshingly detailed. The authors successfully described the 17th Century world in all of its gritty reality. With these hard and unforgiving times as a backdrop, the reader can realize what Dampier was up against and how only an exquisite mind could accomplish what he did, under those circumstances.I heartily recommend this read for anyone interested in seafaring in the 1600's."
3,grass roots reggae beats and a conscious message,Capleton is one of the top dancehall artists. He deejays (raps) over hard core reggae rhythms and tries to send a conscious message in keeping with his rastafari faith. One of the most slept on albums for 1997.
3,Capleton,"Personally I like More Fire and, yes, Prophecy more than this album (despite the unncessary hip hop remixes tagged on the end of Prophecy). But this CD is completely worth having. No Man Can Save No Man is one of my favorite Capleton tracks, The version of Original Man featurting QTip and the classic Lou Reed/Tribe sample is slamming. I really couldn't care if it was some Def Jam crossover marketing scheme, that sht is super fresh. And Baylon a Use Dem Brain with Sizzla is a great track. Anything involving Sizzla in his early days is quality."
5,Give us our due!,"What a fabulous collection! Some others may feel that there were some glaring omissions from this collection, but I think it's perfect the way it is. I love that a lot of lesser-known artists were included. I'm tired of sets that are totally predictable and love having my musical horizons expanded. That's the best way to explore unfamiliar names without buying a whole disc you may not like. I also like that each disc has a theme so I can hear what I am in the mood for at the time. Best of all, it's not geared to only one genre. I try to be open-minded and give all music styles a chance and this allows me to do just that. Buy this for yourself, or another music-lover, you will not be disappointed!"
3,Too Many Omissions,"Not a lot to say, actually. Of course with any of these large scale retrospectives someone is going to have complaints. And that was my first hesitation about doing this review. However I think most people would agree on some of the women who were glaringly left out of the list. Mind you, there may have been legal reasons, but still they could NOT have been left out of something a Century of Women in Music. Barbra Streisand was the first that came to mind. Whitney Houston, Dionne Warwick, Janet Jackson, Pat Benatar, and Reba Mcintyre were just a few of the others that were glaring omissions to me. Even putting personal style aside, each one of those women I mentioned had a vital role in this century's music whether it be for their true quality of work, the epoch of their timing and period, or for their innovation and influence on other musicians and music in general."
3,I've never run this adventure successfully...,"It's not a bad adventure, but I've had players who totally despise it. I never got around to playing the second half (Curse of Tsathoggua), but Trail of Tsathoggua is railroad city. It also suffers from a miserable payoff -- the investigator's think they're gonna find a lost city and end up with a tiny little temple.I had one player tell me ""I hate this game, I hate this scenario, it ...!"" Still feel bad about that. Although, I have learned to GM a lot better since then."
2,Content is good but disjointed in many places,"The content is probably good but it is very disjointed in many places. Large print is good. Mitchell Parry's book ""The Road to Optimism: Change Your Language, Change Your Life"" is less disjointed. I think that the content could be written better if only one author was writing it. I found the first half of the book was much better in content and flow than the last half of the book. It didn't flow for easy understanding. I find that a good book makes me want to read it again. I have little interest in reading this one a second time. NOTE: I only read non-fiction books."
5,Better than any other book on the subject.,"Jamison presents the mental management secrets of Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and others, and shows their direct application to success in business.What he says WORKS!"
1,Does not secure key,There is only one problem with this product but unfortunately it’s a huge problem. There is no way to secure or lock the key in the sleeve and only the sleeve is attached to the key ring. I tried using it for a couple weeks and almost lost my key a handful of times. I can only imagine it would get worse as the rubber stretches.
5,Turn your expertise into marketing power,"In an easy-to-read style, Miriam Otte shows how to turn your expertise into marketing power for your business, and generate a continuous stream of cusotmers. Here's all you need to know to talk your way to business success. Even the terminally shy will find that marketing has never been easier -- or more fun! by Small Business Expert and Author of Working Solo"
2,more of a book for teens,"My husband bought this thinking it would be full of tales..it was short, not very meaty...really a book for younger readers"
1,Does not fit!,This battery DOES NOT FIT the LG L1400. The bottom of the battery compartment on my LG L1400 is almost flat. This battery is rounded on the bottom and doesn't even come close to fitting on my phone.
5,This is a great tool,"I got the tool out of the package and relized that the sliding hemisperical part needed to be filed on the inside to slide properly on the shaft. It was pretty easy. This tool is a real gem. I used it to install big block springs in a 71 el camino. The tool was very safe and very easy to use. forget the jack method, forget the compressor with the hooks,if you got an old classic rear wheel drive vehicle, this is what you want! It was worth every dollar."
5,Palomar does it again!,"With their 4th full length recently released Palomar has again struck indie pop gold! This album showcases sharp vocal harmonies (a Palomar trademark) and ringing guitars, melodic bass, and tight drums. Lyrically the themes continue to mature from previous albums - death, success, and love seem to be the main topics. Palomar are all strength and no weakness on this album, there is no filler here. I suggest listening to the audio samples of ""Bury Me Closer"" ""You're Keeping Us Up"" and ""Whoa"" to get an idea of their range.This album is a departure from their 1st and 2nd albums, but it is definitely in line with their last full lengthPalomar III: Revenge of Palomarwith a continued focus on a more mature and full sounding indie pop. Palomar have never been musical slouches but with the addition of Sarah Brockett and Dale Miller on this (and their last) record they have grown by leaps and bounds. Added production values over the last two records have also helped their sound."
2,yawwwwwwn,"Palomar's first two albums were snappy pop masterpieces. The third edged dangerously into slower territory with little to hold the attention span. All Things Forest is about as interesting as watching trees grow. Why Palomar is now possessed with sugary twee pop, I will never know. Eisley does it a lot better."
2,Cheap looking...,These pedals are very cheap toy-like plastic look. There are plenty of nuts N bolts N metal available at your disposal. I would spend a little more and get better looking pedal covers. These were my first pedal covers but I got a better ones and it makes a big different.
5,Vacuum bag,Length:: 0:22 MinsThe packing on the product was done well and there was 18 bags. They work great.
4,Way Better Than Vol. 1,"I was dissappointed with vol. 1, but it all fit into place with this one. The art is amazing, but with maybe too much details. Alan shows again why he's the greatest comic's writer of all time (for me, that is). Great read."
2,Pretty flimsy and hokey. Poor quality.,"The pieces of this toy (the outfits, etc.) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet. Also, the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing. In general, this toy is hokey and cheap. I recommend Melissa and Doug's Magnetic Dress-Up and/orMagnetic Princess Dress-Up. All the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together. Also, the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized."
4,Easy dress up fun,"My three and six-old daughters received this as a gift and have enjoyed it very much. Fortunately, there are two dolls so each can play with one...no fighting! I find the dolls to be quite durable with plenty of variety on outfits for them to wear. The set is well worth the price, and I hightly recommend it."
4,Very cute,"Very cute, kids love this. Let the kids take it apart, but they broke some of the dresses =( My girls were 4 - 7 when they received this."
2,newstudent,"This may be a good reference book for those who have a working knowledge of this subject, but buyer beware, that's all it is.In the instructions regarding my first essay assignment, the professor said to ""use MLA or APA."" Having no instruction in English over the past 36 years, and no idea what this meant, I looked it up on the internet and ordered this book. In the second chapter: ""The Basics of Citation,"" there is no mention or explanation of basic elements that must be entered into a citation."
5,Mat's favorite video!,"We're a family (4) of Buffett fans, and believe all parrotheads should own this video. Classic...we laughed, we smiled, we sang. From the Walter-Keys to Redmond-Micorsoft-Washington...a must have."
4,Buffett finally brings us a video compliation...Thank You.,"This video is a must for any parrothead. Jimmy narrates the entire video between clips. The video has clips all the way from '73 until the Beach House on the Moon Tour last year. There are clips from his early days in key west, to the cheezy video days of the 80's, to some great live concert shots in the late 90's.I loved the live footage from 'Changes In Attitudes' and the 'In The City' footage as well! Thanks Jimmy....keep the material coming...."
1,What if you can't view it?,"Again, parrotheads living outside of the USA are being ignored. This Buffett video, like the last, is only available on NSTC and not PAL. It's frustrating and disheartening. It is about time those in charge of Buffett productions (and Mr Buffett himself) realised there IS life outside of America. I rate it a one star, only because you don't provide reviewers with the option of Zero."
3,Anything for a buck?,"Let me say that I am a fan in the purest sense of the word. But I must say that the past few years I have seen Jimmy dwindle. The movie was decent but it just goes to show that this man really did turn his back on the ""old school"" way of doing things. He used to say screw corporate america and now he is sleeps with them on a routine basis. I hope his liquor sales help him in the future because his vidoes and songwriting has gone nothing but downhill. ----sorry Jimmy."
2,Mediocre toys.,"I brought those puppets animal for my boy's 1st bday favor. The toys didn't met my expectation. I put the puppet into a bucket and pass out to kids who attended the party. most of kids either ignored the puppet and carryout the bucket out. it didn't even look cute and adorable. images of puppet looks promise when I first made the purchase, but it didn't really delivery."
2,junky,I bought these puppets for school. They are poor quality and the mouths are too hard to control. too expensive for what you get
2,Swing Vocals Not Free Jazz,Just a word of caution. This is not the Don Cherry of free jazz/world music fame. This is the male vocalist of the 50's and 60's. However if you like the swing movement of that era this album may be for you.
1,Student film?,"Why would anyone want to see a badly written directed and dare I say ""acted"", DVD? From the cheaply done opening credits to the first year acting student performances, this movie gets a failing grade. It was so bad, I was cringing with every line. Do not buy this or even borrow it!"
1,blood fued,"If i could have given this dvd less than 1 star I would have. It is the worst dvd I have ever watched and i'm sorry I wasted my money on it.Terrible acting, how it made it onto what I consider a good place to buy quality materials (amazon.com) is beyond me.Save your money on this one!!"
1,"Have to agree, this sucked more than blood","If I could have negatively starred it, I would have. Don't waste time or money on it. The acting was poor and a ten year old with ketchup could have done better special effects."
5,"This book collects the best of ""Naughty Bits""","Of the several Gregory collections of the ""Naughty Bits"" comic book material this is probably the ""best"", the one to buy first that WILL get you hooked!!! Roberta's intimate look at Bitchy's work and social/leisure life is familiar to us all and will keep you laughing spontaneously for days!!! Gregory is the godmother of the female alternative press and truly an artist at the peak of her creative powers! BUY THIS BOOK, NOW!!! (you won't regret it)"
1,And the Band Played On,"It was cheap and still a waste of money.I was expecting (or at leat hoping)for this to be some the original material the group did in the 60's for Gamble Huff. However, it's just old material redone. ""Gotta Find My Way Back"" is great song in its original form. This re-make was a dissapointment. Oh well, it's back to vinyl for this one."
2,Where are the maps?,"There are some interesting notes about the region, but I was quite surprised by how few maps were in this guide--which is why I chose Michelin in the first place."
4,Finally A helpful guide....,"I've read several books on Surrogacy when I was first starting out looking into being a surrogate and none of them were as helpful as this. As a Successful Gestational Surrogate I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is pursuing surrogacy, whether it be someone who is looking to become a Surrogate (Gestational or Traditional) or Intended Parents.I don't feel as if I was ""ripped"" off but the price, and there is a guide to the terminology in the back of the book. For 120 pages there sure is a lot of information packed into this ""small"" book. I was very impressed by this book and how well thought out everything was.From one surrogate to another, Thank you for finally writing a book that was easy to understand."
2,The Man Who Mistook This Documentary for a Story,"I am a big fan of Oliver Sacks and despite my low rating for this book, I will continue to be a big fan. I was simply misled. I thought it was going to be the characteristic, titillating Sacks tale, as were ""Awakenings"" or ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat."" Instead, it was a disjointed journal of Sacks travels in Micronesia. It certainly had its interesting, intellectual points but fell far short of the usual Sacks page-turner."
2,Diffuse; boring; disappointing to a Sacks fan.,"I've been a big fan of Sacks since _Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,_ and have often reread that, his best book. This book, however, is dull and lame. No surprise to learn that Sacks' vacations are pleasant for him -- less surprise to learn they're tedious for us. Illustrated history of cycads -- bah. In a rare dilletantish mood, Sacks rambles around Micronesia shaking hands and looking at vegetation. Absent are the usual meticulous studies of the human mind; the passion is diluted by a rambling, shambling pseudostructure of historical fragments, slogging through ruins, and hanging out with old chums. Then... there are 100 pp of notes about an already tiresome text! Any writer is entitled to a mistake--I will buy Sacks' next book. This one, however, is going into my storage bin."
3,Flip out!,"This is a good book.Sacks is a good writer, he tells a moving story, his descriptions of diving are fine, and the ending is truly beautiful.However, I am going to take this opportunity to comment on a trend I have noticed, and take exception to. This book has 199 pages of text followed by 67 pages of notes. In other words, the notes are about one third of the text. This is inexcusable. Six pages in the final chapter are accompanied by no less that TEN pages of notes. Frankly, I got tired of being interrupted by the author.I feel that writers are getting sloppy. Rather than work an aside gracefully into the text, writers just dump all these digressions into footnotes and let the reader flip.If we are going to pile up footnotes, we need to revise the format, maybe even return to the old usage of putting footnotes at the foot of the page."
2,What a disappointment!,"Having read all of Dr. Sacks previous books, I was looking forward to an enthralling tale. But this book is so disjointed and rambling. It's all fluff and hardly any meat. It could have been expanded and written as four good books: one totally about the Island of the Colorblind; one totally about Cycads; one totally about the neurological disease bodig on Guam; and the final one containing all of Dr. Sacks' trivia about the Pacific Islands.Jumping back and forth between the story and the voluminous notes was irritating, and the notes, while interesting, were not especially necessary for the most part. The good doctor does not go as indepth as he has in his previous books and this is sorely missed."
1,First and last time :(,I receved the wrong item. I can buy that hammer tacker for less in an hardware store. So that was my first and last time.
1,disappointed!!!,We were looking for the PHT250c tacker and what we got was the Fat Max--We do not like these tackers and are very disappointed in what we received..To me that is false advertisement!!
2,"not durable, not the same as older versions","Another teacher at my school has this same hole punch and hers works great, so I ordered the same kind just over a year ago. I did notice a difference in the weight of the hole punch, but it worked the same and punched holes, so I didn't worry about it too much. A year later, the hole punch is busted. One of the holes won't punch, as the metal housing around the pin that punches the hole is completely warped. It jams in the down position, even with one sheet of paper in it. Amazon won't do a full refund after 30 days, so unless you want to buy a new hole punch every year, find one more durable than this one."
4,3-hole puncher: very good product,"I am happy with this purchase. This is a good, useful product that is well worth the price. It is simple technology that won't malfunction. It will last a long time and won't break even if you drop it.My use is for punching 3 holes on the left side of 8 1/2 by 11 sheets for insertion into 3-ring binders. I set the paper gauge for that position, and then taped the gauge in place after opening the bottom of the unit. Then I put the bottom back on, and it will work for years in that position."
4,Good Source ofTechnical Information,"I received my copy of the copy of the GS 750 and GS 550 Owners Workshop Manual 1976 -1982. The book does not contain any information on GS 750 models later than 1979, (16 valve TSCC engines) as the book title would indicate. However the book contains many good illustrations and technical information in general. The illustrations on CV carburator repair and adjustment are very good. The book could use some updates and some better troubleshooting tips,but don't hold your breath."
3,no use,I ordererd the manual because I'm restoring a 1980 Suzuki GS 750. Unfortunately the title of the manual is a bit misleading because it only covers certain of the model years. All th 750's from 1980 are excluded. Under these circumstances I did return the manual because it is no use to me.
5,An absolute MUST SEE,"This is so engrossing, so fascinating, so even-handed and non-political that it is a MUST SEE. I was riveted the entire time."
5,Excellent!,"I showed this film in my US history class. It is well organized and provides a nice summary of events, with the 9/11 Commission as a framework. It is poignant without being overly political (there are some politics in the documentary, but they are well handled, balanced, and are not the focus of the piece). My students loved it and it served as a great conversation starter."
1,disk problems,"What little I've seen of this dvd, it looks interesting. The play back is so bad I can't give it more than 1 star.I've tried two disc's same results.How many more people had the same results?"
3,Not great,I've seen better coverage of 9/11 and was not too thrilled with the content. Lacks the critical questioning of the US government and their role in 9/11. Would not recommend this dvd.
3,Coming of age after the ice age,The concept of life after the return of the ice age and the loss of history is excellent. The characters and their travels were formulaic. This seemed like a good book for teens and possibly would make a good movie.
5,Beautiful Engagement Ring,"This being the noughties.. being able to do most things online - and with spare time at a premium (not wanting, especially, to go around shopping in over-priced stores), I found Amazon's jewelery section great..(Now, you should go to a shop to get sized...)Amazon's ""design-it-yourself"" feature is absolutely great!I know that saying that you bought your diamond online is not exactly glamorous - not like going to Tiffany's or Harrod's...But the ring I got from Amazon is lovelier (and less expensive) than many of the rings I see in display around here...The only problem was that we had to ship it to a sister living in Ohio, and she had to bring it over for Christmas in 07.. (No international shipping; we live in Ireland)However, I believe Amazon UK is now selling jewelry, as well..Highly recommended!"
3,Basic is Right,"This is a pretty decent overall guide to the basics of live sound. I don't regret buying it, but it's pretty simplistic and not very in-depth. But of course, it IS called ""Basic Live Sound."""
3,Live Sound,Good general book. Not exactly what I wanted. I was looking for more practical advice on how to produce better sound in different venues - especially in regards to shaping reverberation and dealing with temperature and climate variations in live performances.
3,Was this used and put back in box?,"This product came in a box that was so beat up that I find it hard to describe. The seat and kneeler pad was dirty and definitely looked like it was used. This was a gift from me to someone else. The product itself worked very well and is well built, however I definitely would not buy from this vendor again."
2,out of date,"Well, although the title of this book contains the word ""current"" the latest study quoted on stents dates back to 1998. Thus, this ""current treatment"" book misses full five years of stent development and progress. Also, I have not found any quoted study from the years 2001 and 2002. How can this book pretend to review current diagnostic and treatment strategies (the copyright of this book is from 2003)?"
4,nice,"nice concise review but may be too basic for many. not cardiology board directed. reasonable accumulation of various trials but seems to lag behind when concerned about some newer therapies / stents etc. useful as aid during med school, residency and quick aid for cardio fellows as well!"
1,American College of Cardiology,"American College of Cardiology is a very important review for my job. I'm a doctor in the S. Camillo hospital, in Rome"
3,Mediocre,"Like most wheels, this one starts out ""whisper silent"" but gradually gets quite loud over time. Rubbing some olive oil or Crisco on the axle helps for a bit, but there is still noise. The Wodent Wheel (which I can't find on Amazon) is the quietest wheel I have ever used. It truly is completely quiet. It's the only wheel that I can sleep in the same room with."
2,2.5 stars for the pet 0.0 for the owner,"This is not very good for peaceful rooms. This wheel squeaks too loudly. Lucky and trixie (my hamsters)love this item,but as for the owner, no. Get this if you are a heavy sleeper or if you really love your pet"
5,Noiseless!!!,"I am very happy with this wheel. Take it from a person who has tested almost every wheel out there for hamsters. My ""dwarf"" hamsters love this wheel because it doesn't take too much effort to make this wheel spin. I love that it also doesn't get stuck after ""dirty"" substances. And I love the feature that it is super quiet!"
4,a narrative joy,"This book has the daunting task of trying to follow Fairchild's collection The Art of the Lathe, and I don't know that anyone could follow a collection that good, but Early Occult Memory Systems is a good try--it is a strong collection. It's longer than your normal poetry collection. It contains two of my favorite Fairchild poems, ""Brazil,"" and ""Rave On."" And the centerpiece of this collection is Fairchild's long narrative ""The Blue Buick,"" which truly shines at some points. With this collection Fairchild proves again what kind of phenomenal poet he is."
1,Broke within 3 days,"I have another Fuji Digital camera which has been fine for several years. I bought this one for my teenage daughter for her birthday and within 3 days of using it , the shutter button stopped working. Amazon paid for the shipping back, no problem, but cannnot replace it with a new one because they won't be stocking any more of this model . This leads me to believe that I am not the only one that has had a problem with this camera. Research others as I would avoid this one even though the price is good."
1,poor reliability,I owned this camera for a bout 8 months and took very good pictures. Than out of the blue I got a focusing error and the lens would not detract. The product is out of warranty and would cost too much to repair. I will never buy this product again.
1,Perhaps I just got a lemon but I preferred my 2.1,"I have found that MOST of my photos with this new 5.1 are NOT very good at all. I MUCH preferred my older A2600 which was a 2.1. The pictures were fabulous with my old camera. I noticed shortly after getting the camera and taking several photos with it that many of my pictures were blurry. I sat and read the manual to ensure that I wasn't doing something wrong. If I do closeup pics, they are very nice, but general photos are most often blurry and horrible. It's incredibly disappointing. If I could just replace my old camera I would except that they don't make it anymore. I used to rave about my old camera, but I am NOT happy with this one at all. I am going to have to send it to the manufacturer to have them check it out and fix it. What a PITA since I bought it brand new!!!!!Good luck to everyone else - I hope you have better luck than I!!!!"
4,A500 nice introduction to the world of digital photography,"Excellent value for money as always with Fuji products, its does what is sets out to do and is a simple to use compact camera with enough manual capability for the basic user, it gives clear bright photos for the resolution, better than you would expect on the downside the video capability has no sound, its slow ( shutter lag ) to use and a little over cost reduced in the case design ( looks better than it really is ), the LCD screen is not much use for determining focus or qulaity of photos, menus difficult to use, battery usage quite high, you must get rechargable batteries, but this is common for most digital cameras, that all said, for the price and to get started in digital photography you cant go wrong, but I predict within a few months the limitations may become frustrating and you will want to upgrade, Fuji do some much better compacts than this, if you dont have any more money then buy this and give it to someone when you upgrade."
3,Great Camera,This camera is easy to use and takes great pictures for the amount of megapixels it has.
3,Alright for beginners.,"I recently purchased this camera for a number of reasons.1. Price2. I am a Mac user and this camera is compatible3. I previously owned a Fuji and was happy with itI am prety happy with the camera overall for what I paid for it, but there were a few things I didn't know about before.1. Terrible battery life2. Extremly expensive XD cards, which are hard to find on vacation3. Cost, I bought this camera a couple months ago for 200 and now I seen one for about a hundred and ten bucks...which I guess is a great deal for anyone wanting one now."
2,Fuji have gone really cheap,"No rechageable batteries,no dock, no web cam feature why did I ever buy this.The zoom on it sucks.Should have stuck with my A340"
3,Gets the job done....,"I had never owned a digital camera before purchasing this camera, so I have nothing to compare it to. For a long time I has simply been using my creative cam as a camera and in comparison the Fugi does provide better quality.What I have noticed is that you have to be pretty close to what you're shooting in order for this camera to be effective. The zoom doesn't off much help unless you are already pretty close to what you're taking a picture of. It takes close-ups just fine. It does not work well in poorly lighted conditions.You have to have A LOT OF BATTERIES!!! I have found that I am left high and dry unless I have at least 2 packs of 10 batteries just to take pics at the beach.I have not replaced this camera yet, but I plan to. I wish I had listened to the many, many reviews that said to spend that extra 50 bucks on a better camera.It gets the job done, but I can't wait to see what a better camera can do!"
2,It broke within three weeks,"The camera stopped functioning within three weeks of purchase. It would no longer close or zoom. It did however take excellent photos while functioning, so it doesn't get the worst rating. We are still awaiting the camera's return from Fujifilm. Sigh."
5,Great Little Freebee Camera,"I was in the market for a new digital camera. My Canon 2.1 MP camera works great but wanted a higher MP digital camera. I found this Fujifilm A500 in my front yard one day. I turned it on and got a ""read error"" on the screen. I took it in the house and formatted the card in the computer and put new batteries in the camera and turned it back on. I re-formatted the card in the camera and it's been working great ever since. It seems to have decent features, especially for the price I paid... And takes good pictures. It holds 205 pics at the highest resolution with the 512 Meg XD card that was in it."
2,Not so great color,"I used this several times, took about 50 pictures with camera, I was disappointed.Compare to my old Fugi A201(2 mega pixel), this A500 does not have good color; it may have better resoltion but the color on photo are not as good as A202.When I checked the spec on those 2 camera side by side, A201 has RGB filter on CCD while A500 ihas just high resolution CCD.Anyway, A500 is disappointment."
5,Lovin' it!,"My first digital camera, and so far I'm havin lots of fun with it! I still haven't used all it's many features as yet, but I would recommend this camera to anyone! I was surprised to find out that my sister, who is a professional photographer, has this exact camera for her personal use. She also loves it!"
2,Silver Boxes,"The book was repetitive and boring. One theme, that could have been stated in a paragraph, was repeated over and over again to create a book. I found it to be primarily about what wonderful things the author has done for people, with letters praising her over and over. Yuk. I read this as a selection for our church's book club, and skimmed the last quarter of it because it simply had nothing to say that it had not been said before. I appreciate the sentiment, just felt that the author spent more time praising herself than anything else."
5,Silver Boxes,This book touched me in a way that wanted me to share Florence's message about encouragement with others. The book is life changing if you put it in to practice.
5,Silver Boxes,"Silver Boxes is one of those books you find, and wonder why no one else heard of it! It is a litle dated, but because of that it is a great deal. It has a very modern/psychological idea about how language and the choice of words that we use to our loved ones, and others, has a real impact on them. It is based on a bible verse with that messsage.I highly recommend this book for silver anniversaies, birthdays, and Christmas. Everyone should have a silver box in their home, to remind them of the fragility of the soul and the power of encouraging words."
4,Praises,"This is good for driving, or when cleaning house. It helps you to remember the little silver boxes that we give to others, and how it will put silver linings in our lives. A good purchase."
3,review,"lovely book, but thought was bigger, Was going to read to our grandson, but is not the story i thought it was going to be"
3,First chapter is amazing but the book slows down,"after that, about 1/2 the book is letters written from women she has spoke to during her tours. I love her other books but this one seemed to be missing substance after the first chapter. Worth a quick read but not her best work."
5,Vaccines we take for granted are luxuries in 3rd world,"I saw this on the BBC last year. The film maker did a good job showing how parents in the developing world struggle to get the medicines for their children that we take for granted. All the stories are engaging and, one, in particular, is heartbreaking (a little girl from Ireland). The director did a good job of making complex problems easier to understand, without condescending. I recommend it for schools and universities, church groups, clinic waiting rooms, and anyone interested in global health challenges."
1,The title is deceptive,"This book might be helpfull to a lawyer - I don't know, I'm not one -, but I did not read anything that could help me prevail ""every place, every time""...""Discover the self"", ""the power of uniqueness"", ""the magical power of feeling""? Come on, give me a break! Worst of all, it's full of unethical tips that made me feel uneasy."
2,A view into the Courtroom.,"The description of the book is deceptive. It's primarily for lawyers with minimal usefulness for'The Marketplace, The Workplace, Every place'. It's interesting as an autobiography."
3,Hmm.. ok..,It was an ok CD. however i have heard better. i personally feel that had they chose a different song for the single they would have raised their [popualariot greatly
2,No stories to tell,"Tracy Chapman can certainly sing in a unique, emotional way. No doubt about that.The trouble is, with the album Telling Stories, that she has nothing new to contribute. She has become more joyful, less worrying, and maybe that's why her music doesn't really work out anymore. It doesn't catch. It bores.Pity.Buy her beautiful - but sad - debut album instead of Telling Stories. 'Cause Tracy Chapman has no stories to tell anymore."
3,ripped off again,"ISNT IT ABOUT TIME THEY PUT PLAYING TIME ON CD COVERS.YES THIS CD IS VERY GOOD,ONE OF HER BEST TO DATE.BUT 42 MINUTES? I FEEL CHEATED. THIS IS ONE OF THE SHORTEST CD'S I'V BOUGHT LATELY,AND THEY AINT CHEAP.WHY DONT THE ARTISTS ADD SOME LIVE TRACKS RECENTLY RECORDED.OBVIOUSLY TRACY IS IS NOT WORRIED ABOUT GIVING HER FANS VALUE FOR MONEY.GOOD AS THE MUSIC IS NOWADAYS WHEN YOU CAN GET 70+ MINUTES OF MUSIC ON A CD THIS IS NOT ON. PERHAPS SHES SAVED THE REST OF THE TRACKS TO PUT OUT A 30 MINUTE CD TO GAIN MORE FORTUNE.IM AFRAID SHES LET ME DOWN."
2,It's not bad...it's just boring.,"I could find no other word to describe this album.I love Tracy Chapman. I have most of her CDs. Her debut being her best album and one of the few albums I have from the 80's that still sounds fresh. And New Beginning was an amazing work with a blues touch that Tracy sounded comfortable with. And her newest release ""Let it Rain"" is definitely her most beautiful sounding album (in fact I'm listening to it now).But this one is I guess anti-climatic (maybe because it was after the big success she had with ""Give me one Reason""). I really didn't hear a standout track. Nothing really grabbed my attention as if saying, ""Stop what you're doing! Your mind and ears are mine!"" All of her albums are solid and full of talent but this album just seems so...ehh (sigh) compared to New Beginning and lackluster next to Let it Rain. If you're new to Tracy start with her Grammy winning debut ""Tracy Chapman""."
3,"Solid, but not awe-inspiring....","While Tracy Chapman does hearken back to the style she first dropped on her debut, this new album doesn't awe or strike me with raw emotion as her debut did, and still does. But fortunately, she is playing in her simple, understated style which won fans over back in '87. ""Telling Stories,"" the title track, though, does sound like it could easily fit on her ""Matters of the Heart"" album. Worth buying for Chapman fans, but again, not a jaw dropper that hits us deep inside like her debut. For the casual fan, buy her debut if you don't have it already."
3,Too much repetition,"I love Tracy Chapman, especially her songs Remember the Tinman, For My Lover, Fast Car, Cold Feet, Sorry, Smoke and Ashes, At This Point in My Life, just to name a few. I like the sound of Telling Stories, and even have a few favorite songs on the album, but find too many of the songs are the same lines repeated over and over. She is so great of a songwriter and storyteller, but I don't find this is her best."
5,Well Worth the Extra Money,"if your a big tracy chapman fan you HAVE to have this import CD. there are 4 live songs and one studio(""baby can i hold you"" off her first album). since she does not have any live CDs out i'd say this is a MUST buy if you like tracy chapman. it is well worth the extra money."
4,Telling Stories....,"This is a great CD for people who appreciate meaningful lyrics. Tracy Chapman really sings from the heart, but that is where her trouble in making songs begins. Tracy knows all about lyrics, she has put excelent lyrics on all of her CD's. But a song isn't just the lyrics by themselves, you've got to have music as well.I believe that in putting all her effort into the making of the lyrics, she has let the music slip a bit. While all of these songs are great, the only one you will hear with any regularity on the radio is the title track, Telling Stories.Go ahead and buy the CD, but just for the lyrics, don't buy it expecting her to jam on a guitar."
4,Simply gorgepous!,"Tracy's latest is a beautiful, complete work from beginning to end. From the single ""Telling Stories"" to ""Paper and Ink"", this is a solid effort. I was never a huge fan of hers until I bought this album. I went out and bought her first album afterweards and I feel this one is much stronger. It has a variety of styles on it and it is beautifully produced. Some of my favorites are ""Telling Stories"", ""Wedding Song"", ""Less Than Strangers"" and ""Its OK"". Buy this album, you won't be dissapointed!"
4,we are less than strangers....,"Tracy has the courage to always say what's in her heart, in her own inimitable style. This is a terrific recording- I didn't like the last record that much, even though it was a huge hit. My favorite CD is still ""Matters of the Heart"" but ""Telling Stories"" is moving up."
4,Just what the title states.,"This latest release from Tracy is aptly named ""Telling Stories"" simply because that's exactly what this CD does. ""Unsung Psalm"" brought tears to my eyes the first time I heard it. On the track ""The Only One"", Tracy teams up with Emmylou Harris to tell the painful story of losing a loved one. The song is absolutely beautiful. ""Less Than Strangers"" speaks of the heartache of a love gone so bad that the two no longer even speak to each other. This CD is a relaxing yet moving offering by Tracy that was certainly worth waiting for."
2,Yawn...,"The people impressed with this must not have heard New Beginnings, her last cd. This new one is so monotone and go nowhere it's a mystery as to what the heck happened. New Beginnings is one of my favorite cd's, and Telling Stories would be my least favorite if it weren't for the title track. This cd has no zip, zing, or pizzazz. Would someone please wake her up?"
4,"Thank you, Tracy","Tracy Chapman has the amazing ability to spin the wisest words into beautiful melodies and sing them with the most soulful voice. With Telling Stories, Tracy has once again expressed what we all, at some point in our lives, need to hear or say. I highly recommend this CD, as well as my all-time Tracy Chapman favorite, Crossroads.... which I heard for the first time during an art class, and haven't stopped listening since. Thank you Tracy, for your wise words, meaningful lyrics, and beautiful melodies."
3,Not Her Best,"This album resembles her first two albums -- Tracy Chapman and Crossroads. Her 3rd and 4th albums -- New Beginnings and Matters of the Heart had a lot more soul-moving and groovin' tunes. This album contains solid tracks (#4, 7, 8 and 9), but it's not Tracy's finest. It's pretty, but a little boring. I like it when she includes more drums and other instruments to flesh out the music and give it more body. This album contains more single guitar tunes. If you are a Tracy fan, you'll like it, but if you want to sample her for the first time, try New Beginnings or Matters of the Heart."
5,Brilliant Again,"This is another great CD from Tracy Chapman. I've been listening to the CD for a few days now and it gets better each time. Wedding Song, Devotion and Unsung Palm have such depth and emotion. My favourite song on the CD is ""IT's OK"". It has one of the most catchiest tunes and she uses more range in her voice. Alot of the reviews I've read are always comparing this CD to her previous work, but I think ""Telling Stories"" stands on its own."
1,MAJORLY DISAPPOINTING! WHAT HAPPENED?,"I love Tracy Chapman. I have all her albums. I was looking forward with eager anticipation to her new album, ""Telling Stories."" I was MAJORLY disappointed on listening to it. WHAT HAPPENED! Chapman sounds tired and discouraged. Her voice lacks excitement and enthusiasm. The songs are lackluster and without feeling; the musical arrangements are basically uninteresting. I guess my disappointment stems, in part, because I am comparing ""Telling Stories"" with her ""New Beginning"" CD, which had such powerfully-worded tunes, as well as interesting musical arrangements that evoked so many emotions. I'm so sad to see this latest CD of hers does not contain the dynamics of ""New Beginning"", or other of her music, for that matter. I will look forward to Tracy's next CD with the hope she will have revived her spirit, and that her song-writing creativity and musical artistry will have returned."
3,A setback for the artist,"As a fan of Chapman's for as long as I can remember, I'm disappointed in this CD. The music seemed lacking, and a huge let down from her previous hits. It reeks of monotony and doesn't have the blues feeling seen in earlier songs. Still an amazing compilation for a truly acomplished woman, but not for the newer listener."
3,"""Sturdy"" ???",Curious why anyone replacing a broken hinge with one of the very same manufacture would say it is sturdy and well made. Surely if it were higher quality to begin with there would not be such a need as is shown in the reviews. There are other options of this style out there and I think I'll take my chances with one of them. I'll chalk up the high rating to reasons other than quality and durability.
4,Good product,"Good hinge for the money! Matched the old one perfectly.Will most likely be ordering another soon, as i appears the other hinge is cracked."
2,Design Flaws,"I bought this bag at the start of the Fall Semester (Sept 07) and the first few months were great. Its comfortable and reasonably well organized. Everything I need in a day fits well, and is very accessible. However, the bottom corner of the bag (I'm now echoing another reviewer further down the page) wore out within a few months. It seems the distribution is off, forcing the weight of the main compartment (which in my case would hold a variety of books and papers on any given day) onto a single corner seam.I'm a fan of the sling design for comfort through the day as well as convenience in accessing the contents of the bag - but this particular model is to be avoided."
1,Doesn't hold up,It is Oct. 12th and we have a second bookbag which ripped out at the bottom corner since the beginning of school. (6th grade girl using it) Store replaced the first within a couple weeks of school with exact same item even though we had a receipt. Figured it may have been a defective bag. Looks like it is just poor design & construction.
1,Not for heavy use,"The upside - great looks, comfy sling, lots of pockets, cool... The downside comes in durability - the bottom ripped at the seams after just 6 weeks of use. This was my 6th graders school backpack. She carries 2-3 textbooks home per night. Certainly a disappointment!"
4,Toddler fun,One of the best Wiggles productions available. Very entertaining with catchy songs and interesting backgrounds.
3,Blast from the past,"Pretty enjoyable, she has the raspy rock voice, but it has that 80's aura, which to me was not my favorite musical era. Bought it for the Todd Rundgren duet, which is interesting. Todd's voice is better now. They should do a follow up duet now."
4,Delightful,"A delightful and thoroughly enjoyable story suitable for all ages, from a 10 year old to my mum's age. The story of an owl told through cartoons, with virtually no words. That means a little concentration and thought is required to follow the story, and have a think about all the meanings and lessons the author is trying to teach. Highly recommended."
5,Simply lovely,"My husband and I are fans of such graphic novels as Preacher, Sin City, Watchmen and The Walking Dead. Imagine our surprise that we would find the Owly series as enchanting as we do.We are cynical comic book readers! But I dare you to read these comics and not become charmed and engrossed with them. Wonderful for readers young and old.I don't want to meet someone who doesn't like Owly."
5,Why Aren't There More Like It?,"Andy Runton has really hit on something here. He's managed to allow readers to remember what it was like to be a kid - the hurt, the hope, and the perseverance that comes from not having a clue as to what can't be done. That's something that both Adults and Kids should be exposed to liberal doses of."
5,to get away from no fun,this lite and airy book lifted my spirt and helped me focus. owlys adventures of seeking friendship are happy and fun
4,"This is Ubiquinone, not the reduced form Ubiquinol","This bottle is Ubiquinone, the fully oxidized form of CoQ10. It is not the reduced (active) form, Ubiquinol. Jarrow does sell the better Ubiquinol, but it's about 3 times the price.I honestly couldn't tell you if this stuff does anything for me, but I find no reason to give it a poor rating. They are black pills to prevent light damage. I give -1 due to not making it clear that this was lesser form of CoQ10 in the product description."
4,A Good Primer on the US Red Scare for 2000+,"First: contrary to another's reviewer's comment (that seemed to fuel his position), the correct name for HUAC IS 'House Un-American Activities Committee' - ""House Committee on Un-American Activities"" is a 'generic' (and incorrect) title.That having been resolved, this is an amazing chronicle of the birth and rapid development of Soviet Communism. The point of this book is to give the reader a comprehensive overview of the US culpability in the development of the Soviet system, all the way back to Wilson and FDR.This is, no doubt, a difficult lesson, but it is outlined in (sometimes tedious) detail. And it leads us to try to understand the Post-9/11 ""American Democratization"" of the world we are now experiencing in other parts of the globe.If you are one who is interested in the US machinations of this period, this is a work that reveals much to be discussed."
1,Anti-PATRIOT ACT hysteria,"""A reader from Alexandria, VA USA"" is absolutely right - this entire book is merely a setup for the epilogue, where Morgan provides a specious equation of McCarthyism with today's War on Terrorism being waged under the PATRIOT ACT. The epilogue is an unfounded screed worthy of Ted Rall at his worst.Sadly for Morgan and his publisher, the sort of people who buy into this PATRIOT ACT paranoia have no interest in reading facts, not even those which are distorted to support their position, as this book is...they have already made up their minds that we now live in an ""incipient fascist state"".Save your money, and just troll the comments on Angry Left blogs."
1,A Manual on Bush Bashing,"I started to wonder at the purpose of Mr. Morgan when he titled the second chapter ""The First American Attempt at Regime Change"". Maybe he had never heard of the Mexican War, Spanish-American War, and several of the other 19th century forays into Central and South America. Then on page 112 he states ""[President] Harding has gone down as the worst President in the nation's history up to the year 2000"". Since the book was published in 2003 Mr. Morgan has to be calling President George W. Bush the worst president ever.I immediately flipped to the Epilogue and in skimming through it finally realized this book is nothing more than a collective Nixon, Reagan, Bush Bashing under the guise of some historical anecdotes.Save your money, I wish had saved mine."
1,Erroneous,"For starters Ted, it's ""House Committee on Un-American Activities,"" not ""House Un-American Activities Committee."" Surely if the author actually researched the primary literature, he'd have noticed this rather large error before committing his book to print.Don't waste your time with this hysterical nonsense. Read ""Stalin's Slave Ships"" by Bollinger (Praeger, 2003) which is available from Amazon. It will give you a taste of what life would be like in this country, had not these poor creatures whom Ted Morgan laments over ""had their careers ruined."""
3,Inadvertent Point,"While Ted Morgan valiantly tries to make the point that McCarthy ""did not emerge in a vacuum"", he inadvertently establishes the deep similarities in thinking between American communists of the 1930s and 1940s and American liberals today--the fight for the aggrieved worker, the consolidation of bargaining power with unions, and politicians capitalizing on new classes of victims."
2,Purchased for 12 Year Old Sprinter - Too Small,"I purchased these for my 12 year old Son who needed a descent set of adjustable blocks for practice and meets. For $50.00 these seemed to be a good set for his age. However, the blocks were to small for him, the angles were NOT adjustable and they were unstable. I ended up returning these and purchased the Champion Sports Olympic Style Starting Block which are well worth the extra money and will certainly last through High School."
3,Warren Stands Out,"In this book, Warren has drawn one of the issues contained within, and it's the only story that stands out. In his usual meta-textural, pop-cultural style, Warren treats us to the retrospective story of Gen 13 done as a TV documentary. Not only are the drawings just as amazing as Warren always does thiem, but the story has a lot of gags and is quite funny.The rest of the stories are not drawn by Warren (only written by him), but the mediocre artists so distract from the story-telling that here, a couple of days after reading the book, I can't remember what they were about."
5,Racing Is A Great Boss Bio Plus...,"Racing In The Street is not so much a great biography about Bruce.It goes much deeper.It is a series of very insightful articles pinpointing the appeal Bruce has for so many of his fans.He is a mega star but it is his struggle to remain normal and humble that is at the heart of this book.For the casual fan, If you truly want to know why his fans are so intense, this is the book to read.For his fans that have always tried to figure out why we are so intense, this book puts all that into perspective better than any other.Highly recommended."
5,No brainer must-have,"For any Springsteen fan who loves every ounce of lyric he's performed from the beginning of time...here's a wonderful collection of articles describing his career written by rock journalists and enthusiasts. Great touch: the map of the Boss's ""turf"" in New Jersey!"
4,City Walls,"This collects Green Arrow issues 34-39 and picks up where Straight Shooter left off. It starts with a fun stand alone story about Conner & Roy having a guys night out. The 6 part City Walls storyline is some of Judd Winick's best superhero work. It features a nice take on the Riddler, a bit of social commentary, and an exciting full scale battle reminiscent of the Lord of The Rings films."
4,The lost of innocence,In this book we saw what when man's dream became the night mare for the rest of Star City and a babtism of fire for spoiler. It was very well done but left you with the feeling you wanted to pick up the next trade as soon as you were done reading this one.
5,The Best !!,I love this bit holder because it has a threaded collar which lets you tighten the bit in. This means the bit doesn't pull out when screwing in your longer screws. The price on Amazon is too much but it is worth the 10 bucks it costs elsewhere.
4,HIstorical perspective,"Good book, interesting that it was written by someone who was there, with mud on his boots. If you are a war history buff then read this one."
1,Confusing,I couldn't really follow the story line. It really confused me. I couldn't tell who was who...what was what...and what was going on. I just thought it was very confusing...to be blunt.
5,Fast,Put 4 of these in my Escort wagon and I can't keep it on the road!Had to add 400 HP!Tesla must have thought up these bad boys!
4,Excellent,"Jason Jenning's books are easy and quick to read, and he has an intuitive penchant for speaking to the essence of the matter without meandering pontificating or citing obtuse theoretical fluff. His books are actually fun to read and move quickly while making his points."
3,Misreading Greenberg,"The last part of this book, the ""previously unpublished debate with Clement Greenberg"" is the most valuable, as it presents Greenberg in his own words. De Duve cannot keep up in this debate, and must be corrected on his misinterpretations and misunderstandings numerous times. Unfortunately, de Duve is all alone in the first part of the book, so his malformed thoughts on Greenberg's ideas do not receive the necessary corrective. The book is, however, useful to any close readers of Greenberg (de Duve himself admits that he is not among the closest of readers) as it clearly demonstrates the failures of logic that seem endemic to Clem's critics. Sit back and watch the intellectual breakdown in action... a little funny, but mostly frustrating."
4,Trois 2,I have a great deal of respect for rainforest films. Trois 2 is an incredible film. I appreciate the character development and the sexual passion shown throughout the film. I recommend!
2,Great safety device just not fro small dogs,"I bought this because the company crash-tested the product and it's composed of human style components. However, it might be great for a large dog but I wouldn't recommend it for small dogs. My two are slim 20 pounds and the heavy buckles seemed like they weighed more than the dogs. The adjustable front pad couldn't be secured in place so it also tended to slip around their slim bodies when they moved. I would not recommend this for small dogs."
3,an ok product,"I got this for my 80 lb dog doubting that it wold fit her- and it did! It really will fit just about any dog!! I did end up giving it to a friend tho- it was cutting around her underarms a bit. Compared to her last car harness that she was outgrowing it just didn't seem as study, the straps were just much thinner in width and thickness. Since she is a larger girl I was more comfortable with the other. It does seem like it would have been ok if I had not had experience with the other. It just made me a little nervous! My friend loves it for her growing 10 week old puppy and it fits and works with him perfectly!!"
3,Not for a heavy chewer,"This is a nice seat belt harness. However if your dog is a heavy chewer, this might not work for you. Our lab/basset hound mix was a HEAVY chewer. He chewed through two of these harnesses! We probably needed a harness made of steel;-)"
2,A wrinkle in time,i hated this book i didnt finish it i t was boring and confusing mrs.who..... mrs.what i didnt care for it i dont give it a good rating
4,"Imaginative, Creative, a very good book","This book made me think about some of the stories that was read to me when I was little. The three witches, the universe without time, amazing. I read this book about two years ago, but I still find it wonderful. If you happen to get a chance to buy another book, I highly suggest that you get this one."
2,"beware, no ending, no solution","spoiler alert, sorta - I won't say who did it, and at the end of the show, you will know, and so do Lynley and Barbara, but they do not and apparently cannot prove it, and the show ends with them essentially giving up, losing against more clever and powerful forces. It is the only mystery show or book I can remember that does that. Very frustrating. I don't know if there was an ""ending"" on the actual TV series, but there certainly isn't one here on this DVD."

5,Silly and hysterical rolled into one....,"I loved watching SpaceGhost,but it was better with Brak in it.It may be silly and maybe a little stupid for the casual viewer,but there's no doubting the fact that this is one funny and clever show!!! I loved the songs Brak would do and the way his voice didn't go with the way he looked and the way it sounded,but it was perfect!! Very funny stuff!!!"
5,"""HOO-HAW""",this show is funny brak and zorak are pretty funny but the real comedy is in brak's dad and his awesome neighbor thundercleese these are some of the funniest characters on tv listen very closely to dad's advice and try and understand what he's talking about because i dont but the show is still great
3,Watchable,"Well, I'm a huge Brak fan. I have a few of his CDs and they still crack me up, what can I say. I had never seen the Brak show but picked it up on a whim -- it turns out I wasn't missing much.Brak is great and all, I love the character they have for him -- but this show just really isn't very funny. And I'm all for stupid funny, nonsense funny, etc. Brak has a few clever lines, but most of it is just pretty boring. It isn't appropriate for kids, and not funny for adults. Don't really know what the point of it is.I did watch all of Disc 1, hoping for something really funny. There were a few laughs, but overall the episodes are just short, non-hillarious entertainment.If you love Brak enough that you can handle some seriously mediocre humor, give The Brak show a try."
2,I didn't like it!,After loving Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law I decided to give other Adult Swim shows a try and I figured that The Brak Show would be equally as wacky and inventive. It's not.Brak has a really stupid and annoying voice and I can hardly figure out a word he says. The animation is cheap and tacky. And I hate the fact that his dad is a midget (an animation goof by the artists who thought it funny and kept it in). I didn't find it to be that way.In fact I hated almost everything about this boring show and I promptly sold the DVD a few days after buying it. I was deeply disappointed and I hope that other Adult Swim shows such as Space Ghost and Sealab 2021 are better.
2,OK....,I bought this because I was familar with the Space Ghost show and liked it and the fact that this was 50% off. It is strange in an uncomfortable way and tends to be very long in parts.
2,Don't get me wrong...,"I really like Adult Swim. I also really like the episodes of The Brak Show that I've seen on Adult Swim. Which is why I was disappointed with this DVD release. I hadn't seen any of these first season episodes previously, and didn't find any of them to be nearly as good as what I had seen on Adult Swim. Whenever I had seen the show previously I would be laughing throughout almost the entire episode--that didn't happen with a single one of these episodes. With many of them I don't think I laughed even once. They were as equally bizarre as later episodes, but without being funny. Anyway, I hope Cartoon Network releases later seasons on DVD."
3,Making Wood & Stone Jewelry,"Book has lots of ideas to show how anyone with a few inexpensive tools can make jewelry from wood, either alone or combined with stones. There are lots of pictures and clear, step-by-step instructions. This book was first published in 1978 and has 95 pages."
3,"It worked, but not a ""legacy tool""","This kit worked fine, I guess I shouldn't complain for the price. Don't expect to use this tool more than once, it is made of plastic and will wear out after one or two uses."
3,Only good could be better,The jig itself it spot on but the bits have something to be desired espically the smaller lock bore bit. I have done several doors now and the lock set bit gets hot and i was just drilling hollow core slab doors nothing special you have to apply way to much presure to dill an inch hole .
3,Works well but...,"This worked very well to ""rehole"" our 1950's house, but I should have listened to other reviewers, the blue color stained my doors. The second time I used it I covered the area with painters tape and the tool wore right through that too. So, excellent for hole cutting and bad for paint job! In our case, repainting was easier and less expensive than hiring a professional or buying new doors. Pick your poison with this one or be more clever than me in terms of door protection."
2,Spend more if you are doing more than 1 door.,"This got the job done, but I'm really glad I read the other reviews of this product before I used it. It has a horrible blue dye that rubs off. I used painter's tape to protect my door, as I was adding a deadbolt to an existing door and did not want to repaint.This also does not have the necessary tools for installing the frame side of a door (e.g. templates for the strike plate, or a template for the hinge that will fit in a door frame.And finally, it was close enough I suppose, but the holes I got on the front and back of the door using this tool were not perfectly aligned. I had to rotate the latch a few degrees from vertical to get smooth operation, and there appears to be about 1/16"" difference between the front and back holes.Overall, it worked well enough for my one door, but if I had to do multiple doors I would buy a better quality product that is more sturdy, and has more templates."
2,You get what you pay for,"Plastic door knob jig is cheap plastic. It wiggled so much while drilling my circle looked more like an egg. The bits are garbage too and the 1"" bit didnt even fit. I ended up having to use a 1"" spade bit and praying to god I would have a steady hand. The adapter fell apart. If you just have ONE hollow core door to do this may work. The only saving grace was the jig and router bit for the mortices. Those were helpful but could also be purchased elsewhere. Frankly buy a decent milwaukee kit and do it the old fashioned way.Milwaukee 49-22-4063 Hole Saw Lock Set Kit"
3,Fine for a one-time use..,"I am an advanced ""do-it-yourselfer"", and I am not very impressed with this product. The material is not as sturdy as you'd like...and it even broke when I used it on door number two. Let me say this, you really should hire someone to install a new door if you are unsure of your abilities...it requires much more than comes in this box, especially if your home is older. Older homes rarely are square, and therefore doors will require sanding or shaving to fit into doorframes. This product was moderately useful, so I am willing to give it a few stars."
1,Great Idea... not so great reality,"While I feel this is a great idea, I purchased this just to fix 1 white wooden door... I had 2 issues that made this product more hassle than it was worth.1. Plastic guide that your circle saw goes through got Blue Dye all over my white door, which did not come off. I had to repaint over it. I tried multiple cleaners and a Mr Clean Magic Eraser.2. The Plastic guide is flimsy and when trying to enlarge a hole from 1"" the beginning of the bit work is all over the place. This is probably due more to not having the Pilot Bit in place due to a hole already being there.Overall, I would spend the money and get a nicer one if you are going to do more than 1 door. In the long run you will probably save more time."
5,Worked like a champ on 4 solid core doors,"Review title says it all, I used this to redo the locks on 4 exterior, solid core doors. There was already ahole, but it was too small. With nothing for the pilot bit to bite into I was concerned about getting the hole drilled in exactly the right spot. No problems at all using this jig to accomplish the job. Several other reviewers commented that the jig left blue dye on the door, I did not experience this on any of my doors."
5,Door Lock Installation Tool,"Super fast shipping. Great value. Tool worked very well, just what I needed to install a lock set on a new door. One thing is you must use a powerful drill and take your time. Make sure the tool in mounted firmly on the door for best results."
2,"Work OK, but it stained my doors!","I bought one of these at the local big-box store. It works OK, but if you have more than one or two doors to do, I would recommend spending a little more and getting something better.Normally, I would give something like this 3 stars. (It isn't great, but it only costs $15). But I'm knocking it down to 2, because it left blue dye all over my newly painted doors. And the dye won't wash off. What the heck?!!? I had to cover the whole inside of the jig with blue painter's tape in order to use it."
5,My Favorite,"I prefer C-Line sheet protectors over all others. They are durable, and seem to be easier to load. Would recommend this product."
5,Great duffle bag,"I bought this bag for our camping gear. It was just perfect, and the airlines did not charge for oversized bag. We packed three sleeping bags, tent, stove, towels, and misc flash lights and cooking utensils. It performed very well going over and coming home. Great bag and a great price. It still looks new. I would recommend it to a friend."
5,really big carry bag,this bag is enormous will carry a lot of items for a get-a-way folds into a small size great bag
1,Get a maxpedition instead,"About a week using this, main compartment zipper broke. #Fail. Rest of the bag still holding up ok though. Spend the extra money and get a solid maxpedition bag or at least some other well built bag from a quality manufacturer."
4,Gi-nor-mous!,"I am a Judo coach, and I was looking for a bag to handle all my martial arts gear. I usually take 3 gi's with me, as well as the obligatory extra clothing, toilet articles, flip-flops, record books, etc.This bag has a LOT of room to SPARE after I put all my gear in it! Trouble is, Im getting older, and when I fill my bag up, it's a LONG walk from the parking lot into the tournament. Dang bag weighs a ton lol"
4,Very useful,"It is big and very light weight, has good number of compartments for carrying various kinds of luggage, over all it is a pretty decent product."
5,My new go-to duffel bag,I like to travel with duffel bags instead of roller suitcases because they're easier to maneuver. This one replaced my old one which had several holes. This one is heavy duty and I can see it lasting for a long time.
2,Big but not too sturdy,"I loved this bag - it is huge and had room for everything. Plus it doesn't weigh anything, so it didn't take away any of the precious weight that I was allowed to bring on the airplane! Unfortunately, I noticed when I got back from using it on my first trip, that it had a gash in the bottom of it. I guess I got what I paid for - it wasn't expensive, but didn't hold up past one trip. Bummer."
2,zippers aren't heavy duty enough,"If you would like a light-weight, ginormous duffel, this is for you. However, it was too light duty for me, had to return it and get a Mountain Smith."
2,not very strong,This bag was not nearly as heavy-duty as i was hoping it would be. the zipper does not look like it will endure much stress and the nylon is not very thick.
5,HUGE and appears durable!,"I bought this duffel bag because I have a lot of gear for snowmobiling and was tired of using trash bags that rip all the time. I really wasn't expecting the x-large one to be THIS big though. I can get my snowmobile suit, BIG winter boots (size 15's), two gallons of oil plus all my clothes for a 4 day trip in here. OMG. I may not be able to lift it when I get it packed though. :) The sizes are as follows: X-Large: 16"" x 18"" x 36""; Large: 15"" x 15"" x 30""; Medium: 12"" x 12"" x 24"". I could definitely have gotten away with a smaller one but oh well, less trips I have to make into the cabin now. Ha, ha. This size bag comes with a travel pouch for your toiletries or other things that you'd want to keep separate or for storing this bag after your trip completes."
4,tough and roomy,"The Outdoor duffel is just what it claims to be. Sturdy, tough, roomy and easy to handle. The only negative is the zippers, while good quality, could be meatier. I also bought the same duffel in large. The large is cavernous - more suitable for a travel suitcase than a gym bag."
4,Duffel Bags,"Well constructed, roomy and enough zipper compartments to suit my needs. Liked the bag so much bought one for husband."
5,"Super, roomy and sturdy",This bag is great. You could pack a weeks worth of clothing in here. Its sturdy and roomy with the extra bag for personal items. ITs great.
5,Huge and durable!,"This bag helped me a lot on my way home from ""shopping intensive"" vacation. It successfully survived several connections. The singe disadvantage is its size: when it is fully loaded, it happens to be too heavy for a small framed girl. =)"
5,Good Duffel,We bought a few of these for moving a child to college out of state. Stuffed with clothes and shoes is about 45 pounds or so. The bag is a bout a pound so it carries a lot and accommodates the airlines' 50 pound weight limit and measurement standard. We especially likes the side compartments that are separately zippered and it seems quite sturdy. Happy with it.
4,"Solid, sturdy duffel bag","I've been using this bag pretty consistently for several years now and it's served me very well. Nothing special about it, just a big, reliable, study bag."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I was plesantly surprised by both the size and quality of this duffel bag. It arrived from Amazon in a packed/compacted state and I thought ""great, I'll be sending this back"". I was wrong."
2,Poor Construction,"I purchased three of these bags in July. I have used each no more than twice and gently to boot. After just two uses, seams on two of the bags have split -- note without stuffing them even close to full. Disappointed. I expected these to be bags I could use for all sorts of stuff for years. Not so."
5,Great,"Tough pack. We took it camping in Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite, and it was sturdy enough to take it."
2,Cheap!,"I only packed a few clothes in this bag, it was about half full and not very heavy. I went to hang it on my shoulder and the strap feel off. Now it didn't break because it was a safety release if the bag was to heavy. But I barely put anything in the bag to carry. So it is useless unless you want to hold it by hand and not over the shoulder."
4,Lightweight Yet Tough Duffel - Good Value,"I purchased two of the Large bags and one XL. I packed each with gear for my sailboat - hardware, tools, rope, survival kit etc. - right up to the 50lb checked bag limit, and checked them Mobile-Dallas-Miami-San Pedro Sula (Honduras). Each arrived unscathed. They are so light that I was able to pack at least an additional 10 lbs of cargo per bag vs. the lightest hard cases that I might have used. Very easy to pack with the full top opening and rectangular shape. The carry case that each came packed in is a handy bonus. The XL actually exceeds most airline size limits, but I did not pack the side pockets and it was accepted. The zippers may appear to be a bit lightweight, but so far no problems."
4,"Decent bag, a little flimsy","I got the medium gym bag to put my equipment when I go weightlifting at the gym. (Belt, shoes, towel, chalk, notebook, water, protein shaker). Turns out the medium is still too big for my needs, but that's my fault and not the product.The bag is light and can fold really nicely into a TINY square (size a little larger than a sliced bread) but that also means that the bag is a little flimsy. It's always a tradeoff between the 2.I just got it so I don't know it's durability, but I am a little worried about it. Structurally, I wish it were sturdier, even if it meant being heavier."
5,This bag is big,"I bought this bag to put most of my misc. camping items in for storage and to take with us to go camping. When it arrived I took the thing out and this thing is HUGE. I did not expect it to be that big. That is a good thing actually. I only filled half the thing up with plates, pumps, propane canisters and other items and still have a ton of room to spare. The quality is decent as well."
4,Does the job.,"I bought this in 2008 directly from Amazon. It cost $22 back then, and arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping (which is basically standard shipping). It arrived securely in a cardboard shipping box. Nothing was damaged during shipping and all materials were new.It does what it's suppose to do, which is hold my clothes while I'm traveling.The material is made out of cheap fabric, but it's durable. None of the seams are broken, nothing is tearing, there are no holes or anything, zipper works just fine, shoulder straps works. Shoulder strap is adjustable. There is a zippered front pocket compartment, and pocket compartments on each side of the duffel."
5,"Durable, roomy bag.","I'm very happy with this duffle bag. It's HUGE, made with durable material and came with a bonus toiletry case. The large main compartment fit my sleeping bag, thick sleeping pad and everything else I needed for a week long camp."
4,Large and Well- Priced,"We bought this when my daughter needed a big duffel bag for hauling stuff to and from ski trips. The last one had fallen apart. This one is reasonably robust, and reasonably priced.Note that it's large, though, and heavy/awkward if full."
4,Large bag,"I bought it as a hospital bag and it turned out to be too large for my purpose, but it still a good bag that I'll use mostly for trips."
1,Tore the first time I used it,I used it one time and the barrier between the main compartment and side compartment ripped. It is quite large and if it didnt rip would have gotten a much better rating.
3,love it!,"I used this for a mixed business/pleasure trip. The top compartment carried my trade show booth and materials, and the bottom compartment took all my clothes and shoes. One bag, no extra fees at the airport. I love it!"
3,large,"Bag was bigger than I thought it would be. Using it to put all of my sons stuff when traveling. Had it about 2 months now and the pocket on the end is ripping. Not bad for the price I guess, would pay more for sturdier bag."
2,Poor Quality,"This bag is huge. However, the quality is not great. The stitching on the inside of the bag separating the outside small pocket from the large inner compartment has separated and now I have a two pocket bag instead of a three pocket bag. Similarly, the small pouch that cam with it also ripped."
5,"Amazing clarinet, from oldiest Europian factory.","Clarinet is by far ,beyond his price tag. Beautiful tone, amazing craftmanship, and stuning look. You have to try it.Really stuning !!"
4,Been All Around This World,"If you likes The Grateful Dead and if you like bluegrass, then this is something you have to have"
5,THIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOU UP LATE INTO THE NIGHT!!,"Bride starts the saga of the Christopher family which Mr. McCarry has written about in his other novels. If you like a book about adventure, family and love, this book is the book for you!! It takes you back in time and deposits you there where the sheer beauty and explosiveness of Mr. McCarry's writting will keep you for many hours!! You will miss these characters when the book is over and if you are like me, that is how you measure how good a book is!! Read this book, you will not be let down!!"
5,Another excellent book by McCarry!,"Almost an invisible author, McCarry is an excellent writer, with much knowledge and detail. If you want to know the ancestral background of Paul Christopher, read this marvelous novel."
1,Wretched Soap Opera,"As a BSG fan, I was looking forward to Caprica. Nothing could prepare me for how bad it really was.All of the elements were there to make something good- cast and setting. After a semi-interesting pilot, the series devolved into a convoluted soap opera about a teen aged girl/terrorist/religious nut. Sorry- but the mono-theistic robot theme was the weakest part of BSG(2003). Caprica was not improved or elevated by basing the whole wretched show on BSG's weakest plot element.Religious robots? You GOT to be frakking kidding. Machines don't need invisible friends. That's a problem endemic to neurotic humans.Despite all its promise, the ""SyFried"" channel delivered a heaping, steaming, reeking load of garbage."
4,Enjoyed watching,I enjoyed watching Caprica after watching the entire Battlestar Galatica series. I would have preferred the series to not have been canceled. The ending was more abrupt than what I would have liked but that happens when the show is canceled.
1,Don't bother!,The pilot was interesting. The series could have had potential but went in too many disjointed directions. Even in the commentaries they admit there were plot points and/or events that made no sense. Eric Stoltz is a good actor - too bad.
5,great si-fi drama,If you are a fan of BSG then you should get this. It is a shame that SyFy has chosen to forget its science fiction roots and put wrestling on instead of great shows like this. I can't wait for BSG Blood And Chrome to come out.
2,Not as good as BSG,"The show had an interesting concept but it was poorly executed. When the show came on back this past september, it did a 180 in direction from the episodes back on the spring, with a confusing story line on mob like story, then the last 5 episodes took a different direction, moving into a hirer gear, but at the same time dropping characters or situations and designing new ones that seem to forget the previous ones. I can see why it was canceled. I feel V may be axed quickly too."
3,Nothing ever happens on Caprica . . . boring . . . boring,"Caprica undoubtedly boasted one of the most talented casts on television, and in that respect only it was a worthy heir (predecessor?) to BSG.But, as the paraphrase from Waiting for Guffman suggests, nothing ever seemed to happen. You could have condensed most of the material from the first one-and-a-half seasons into a few episodes.It is entirely unsurprising that the show was cancelled. It lasted longer than I thought it would."
5,Loved it,"Well Caprica was amazing. battlestar Seasons 1 to 4 were amazing. Actually all of Battlestar was great save the last episode. When they do a great prequel like this I get really happy and then sad about the last Battlestar Episode again. Well in any case, This rocked and I got it and I have it all save season 5 of BS."
2,only buy after the last 5 episodes are shown on tv,"Caprica is a great show that was unfortunately on a now crappy network. While it would make a great companion to the galactica series, I will hold off on buying this series until the final 5 episodes are shown on tv, and a complete season box set is produced for a reasonable price comparable to other series being released by other companies. fool me once......."
5,Syfy cancelled a great show ... again!,"The storylines keep getting better but Syfy, like many networks, won't believe in a show long enough to build an audience. I'm dissapointed that it's been cancelled, but I intend on buying the box sets anyway because I think the cast, creators, and anyone else that worked on the show should be recognized for the great work they have done."
5,Great Show,Great Show and it was really picking up towards the end. Too bas it was cancelled prematurely shame on you SciFi....it would be nice if they did a nice 2 hour move or a mini series to really tie up the loose ends of the series. They better make BSG Blood and Chrome in to a series now.
5,Loved the series!,"I feel the reason the series was cancelled is because it was too much like a soap opera, they concentrated too much on the melodrama of people's lives and not enough on the evolution of the robots."
5,"Great series, too bad it's audience wasn't patient","I really enjoyed the Caprica series. It spent a lot of effort establishing the story of the colonized planets prior to the development of the Cylons, and began to evolve into the events precluding the first Cylon War. There is action, but not to the level of the original Battlestar Galactica series. But, it's not supposed to. This is the story of how it all began. I only wish the Battlestar audience was a little more patient, because we would have gotten the origins of the time before Cylons and what led to their hatred of humans. The Caprica series probably only had 3 seasons in it maximum to be able to tell the whole story, but sadly it ended after only 1. I bought it anyway for how much I enjoyed it. Same review goes for the Caprica Season 1 discs, since Season 1 and 1.5 are really the same season."
5,From The Heart,"I enjoyed this DVD just as I did the CD. I really felt these songs and the motive behind this production was from the heart of Mr.Cage. I really enjoy ""Any How"" with him and David Hollister. Of course I was delighted to get that peak at J Moss and I am desparately waiting from a live DVD from him. I loved Kim Burrel song as well with J Moss, If You Never.Thanks Mr. Cage. God Bless you and me to.""Carolina Girl"", Celest"
1,Poorly Designed for Repairs,"This is a beautiful faucet but it is poorly designed for repairs. Mine started leaking through the valves (would always drip) and through the gooseneck connection. Unlike most faucets, nothing disassembles from above the sink. You have to go underneath the sink to repair. It's very easy to install, but nearly impossible to fix."
2,exspensive- no difference to some much cheaper brands,O.K. tape but the way I loose them I prefer to buy tapes such as Stanleys less exspensive models. The Stanleys and like seem smaller and the tape just as rigid. I just received as a gift the ***new***- not last years model of Black and Decker Autotape. So far I really like it(works much better this year) just hope I do not loose it.
3,Measuring up to expectations,"This tape measure is fine for home use but I think I would spend a couple of extra bucks and get the Fat Max next time.The nice things about it are that it is sturdy and comes with a nice belt holder with quick release. The tape lip retracts when you are measuring from a direct surface and then pulls out (about a eighth inch) when you are hooking it to the end of an object to measure.At first I thought the extra large locking mechanism was nice, but after using it for a month now it I think differently. a slight bump while measuring makes it lock the tape measure when you don't want it to.The design of the tool makes catching the lip of the tape on an object (wood, drywall etc...) difficult and thus the tape seems to want to pull upward on flat surfaces.For the money, I am satisfied with my purchase of this item."
5,Big Johnson tape measure,"I am a kitchen remodeler and use this tape all day long. I bought it soley for the belt clip because I don't wear a tool bag. It clips on my pants belt and I have stopped ruining my right pants pocket from using metal tape measures that clip on. Problem solved. Next the tape hold is very strong and quick to use with one hand. The next best feature is the inside to inside measurement. Just add 4""!! Not 3 1/2 like so many other tapes. I will continue buying this tape. Longer standout would be appreciated though."
2,Sturdy but not perfect,"The Power Tape is a very solid tool. Very sturdy and the measuring is great and very accurate. The housing is very well made too.On the downside, the tape is too large to my average-size hand. The button on the top is especially hard to control. When you hold the tape in your hand, there is no convenient way to push either side of the button. That's annoying. I am using my older tape now."
3,"ok, but flimsy for 2+ feet measurements","I bought 4 of these to spread out around the house as we're always looking for a tape measure (house remodeling). I like the belt clip and the quick release/replace feature. What disappointed me was the flimsy-ness of the tape itself when measuring anything over 2 feet 'in the air', if the tape is sitting on a flat surface you're all set."
5,Big Johnson Tape Measure,"This is the 3rd one I have owned and will not use another tape measure. I love the way it fits in the hand, the lever lock and the tip for inside and outside measurements. The belt clip doesn't fail. A real quality product."
3,"Cold-Smoking & Salt-Curing Meat, Fish,& Game","I bought this book for our son inlaw, He seems happy with it after having a good look but has not tried anything out of it at present"
2,Not what I had hoped for . . .,"This slim volume, while interesting, did not provide the depth I had been hoping for. However, what really ticked me off is that the index is horrible. I was particularly interested in a recipe for cold-smoked salmon. There is one in the text, but it doesn't show up in the index. Of course the author also suggests cooking the smoked salmon before eating -- yeah, that would be great on a bagel!"
1,Worst Book in my library,"This is the worst book in my Library. It uses ""Salt Peter"" for curing, instead of the more modern Tender Quick or Cure #1. The recipes must be really old to use a cure that really isn't even sold to the public for curing meat any more.Save the money you'd waste on this book, and use it for shipping charges for a much better book. There are many!"
2,Not a guide for cold smoking,"In my view, this book is not a good guide for curing and smoking anything, let alone cold smoking.I question if the author has actual experience, it appears that he has just read other material,and written it up differently. He seems to be written by a guy who writes books (on any subject) for a living."
4,Home Smoking Food,Quite a good introductory book on the subject. Obviously very American in approach but everything can easily be translated to an European perspective. Don't expect an in depth coverage.
4,Madden has equal gust for the grill and the grid iron.,"Typical Jon Madden. Big grills, big meats, and big dishes are what this book is all about. The roughly 100 recipes come from authentic and experienced tailgaters that have brought vigorous American life to the lots and for years, including the big man himself. The original chefs all have a bio and a their recipes a story."
1,Terrible!,"I had great difficulty assembling this hoop. Three pieces were missing when I got the hoop, and while I was assembling the hoop, I had to call Spalding because I couldn't complete a couple steps, and they helped me. The day after I set it up, I was shooting around, and the entire backboard shattered like a windshield. The glass didn't fall though, thankfully. I followed the directions word for word, and this is what happened. I am extremely disappointed. Do not buy this hoop!"
1,Shattered!,"The system was a bit of a pain in the @$$ to put together; but once it was finished, it work well; for a while. Then 15 months after purchase, the backboard shattered with an ordinary jump shot from a 9 year old bouncing off the rim. Pretty pathetic really. So now I have to buy a $300 replacement backboard. This must be how they make their money. If I had it to do over again I would have spent the extra money for a Gorilla Goal. Everyone I know who has one have never had a problem. Lessson learned..."
1,SHATTERED BACKBOARD,"My experience was the same as the last reviewer; perhaps only affecting recently shipped backboards. Mine shattered after 2 days on a routine shot following professional assembly.5-13-12- Update: customer service from Amazon was wonderful and allowed me to replace only the backboard while sending back the remainder of the replacment unit. I did notice that the replacement unit had a foam insert between the rim assembly and the backboard that was not present with the initial assembly, so hopefully that is the fix and I won't have to deal with another shattered backboard. Friends and I used it yesterday for over an hour without incident"
1,"Yes, it can happen to you!",IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU!! We bought this product even after reading reviews about shattering backboard. We figured it was unlikely to happen. Our neighbor has the same one and has had no trouble. Shipping was super fast. Had it in two days. Hubby and son spent a couple of hours putting it together. Put backboard on pole. While moving pole into place on the driveway the entire backboard shattered! Rim wasn't even on. It's Sunday so will talk to Spalding tomorrow. Very disappointing! Will update review once we know more.UPDATE: Contacted Amazon returns instead of going to Spalding. Amazon returns was amazing. We had a new backboard within days. They picked up the old one and shipped it back with no additional cost to us. If you have a problem go directly to Amazon instead of Spalding. I know people who went to Spalding and it took a whole lot of pictures and a huge hassle to get a new backboard in 3 weeks time.
1,Nightmare,"This system looked great and the thought of having a glass backboard was very appealing. Unfortunately the backboard splintered upon installing the rim to it, not once, but twice. The directions are very specific to not overly-tighten, which I did not. As a matter of fact, the 2nd backboard that splintered did so after installing only 2 bolts to it (instead of the 4 it requires). I immediately disassembled the entire system, phoned Amazon, and they returned it without any hassle. I've since purchased a new system (from Amazon)with a polycarbonate backboard and will never purchase one with a glass backboard again. Amazon customer service made a terribly frustrating experience bearable with their excellent customer service."
4,works well,I purchased this system because it had a thicker pole compared to other portable systems. The system is well built but the backboard does shake a little when the ball hits it. I think the degree of shake is acceptable. I chose to fill mine with sand instead of mixing water and anti-freeze ( I live in the midwest). The front piece of flat triangle shaped plastic does rebound a lot of the shots.My only complaint with the system (and why I didn't give it 5 stars) is with parts that were missing from the box. I was missing 4 white plastic spacers. Make sure to check all pieces before assembly. If you are missing anything call spalding directly for replacement. Don't waste your time with their website they don't get to your missing part request for several days. It took me a week to get the right parts sent to me.
5,Very good product,This is a very good and solid basketball system. My dad and I put it together in about 5 hours. It is sturdy and also looks very good. Reading some of the other reviews made the install much easier. For the most part you can put it together alone and you really only need help when attaching the poles together and installing the backboard. The unit when put all together is heavy so you definitely need two adults to tilt up and also move. To install the poles put some WD40 on both and place a wood piece on the ground and then pound the poles together until one slides over the other. Be firm and use enough force else it won't work. Everything else was easy. Just be patient and read the instructions. You won't be disappointed.
3,Chrome - 'Red Exposure' (Cleopatra),"Originally released in 1980, this was Chrome's fourth actual album. Liked 'Blood on The Moon' and '3rd From The Sun' much better [see my reviews of both]. Not my favorite Chrome effort - but for now it will simply have to do. Cuts here that made for decent listening are ""Jonestown"", the sedate ""Animal"", true industrial ""Eyes in The Center"" (maybe the disc's best track), the quirky ""Electric Chair"" and ""Nights Of The Earth"". Fact that this CD's remastering isn't the best just might be a major reason why 'Red Exposure' didn't trill me much at all. I mean, I love the Cleopatra label + most of Chrome's records but I guess they all can't be a true masterpiece."
4,Lots of action from great characters!,"This is a great DVD set because it contains my son's three favorite characters - Bob the Builder, Fireman Sam, and Thomas & Friends! The set is all about non-stop action and includes some great episodes. There are two Thomas & Friends episodes, one Bob the Builder and one Fireman Sam episode. Now these are not new episodes but rather a collection of the characters action packed episodes. So if you are buying this set, I would make sure you or the child you are buying it for doesn't already own the DVDs, we only had one of the episodes so the other three were great for us! The set is great though overall because on Amazon it comes out to be only $4 a DVD, and at least for us I don't mind having a duplicate of DVDs my sons love because I can keep one in the car and one inside. My sons love all four episodes and I find them wanting to watch each one equally. The Thomas & Friends Track Stars is neat because it contains most of their favorite trains."
2,Mediocrity at its best,"Fantastic selections, performed by nice voices, not an accolade- just a nice intro- there is a reason that the great opera singers are 'great'"
1,The Author is NOT my Girlfriend...,"I read this book early in my own infertility journey. Unfortunately, all this book did for me was SCARE the living daylights out of me. The author encountered some of the ""worst-case"" scenarios that we all know exist: extreme adverse reaction to Clomid, ectopic pregnancy, etc. Rather than serve as a practical guide to the day-to-day drone of infertility, the book dealt in worst-case scenarios.[...] the ultimate insult comes at the conclusion of the book when the author implies that you can ""just relax"" and get pregnant. All of us dealing with infertility have certainly been given that ""advice"" by all of our ignorant acquaintances and families already... which led us to look for books to help us cope. Shame on the author for compounding the insult."
4,A new insight,This book is very interesting. It reads very well. It is written in common everyday language. Anyone over the age of 18 could read this. It is not recommended for all persons due to the sexual content and graphic language. It really makes you wonder how a man can write about certain female issues. Not all of his information was plausible but it will keep you laughing. He needed better research on the female psyche and menstrual cycles.
2,Poor quality,"I've been eating these rice cakes for a year now and they're excellent. When I saw that I could buy them online by the box, I was thrilled because the sesame Seed ones aren't easy to find in the local grocery stores.Although they arrived in a timely manner, they weren't packed well enough to cut down on breakage. That wasn't the worst part though. Having eaten these for a year or more, I've had fresh ones from the local stores. The ones I received here didn't taste fresh and sometimes tasted stale.With rice cakes, that makes a big difference.I think I'll keep to the local stores and take my chances at fresh packages."
1,not so much....,I was very disappointed. They were in pieces and seemed stale. Yuck. Not like the ones from Lundberg that I get at WF Market. Maybe I can make some GF granola or party mix out of them if I toast them in the oven first. A real bummer...
2,Rice Cakes in Shambles,"The package came with what seemed like adequate packaging. But upon opening the individual packages, almost all the rice cakes were broken into pieces and just individual pieces of rice remained. Very disappointing...threw most of them away."
5,Excellent quality!,"These rice cakes (and this brand) are the best in every regard---they're friendly to the environment; they're great for those of us who are allergic to wheat; they have a wonderful, substantive texture, and taste really good. I'll be a repeat customer for a long time."
1,Flavorless,"If this has salt and sesame I'll eat my hat. OK, it has salt but apparently so little that it's not able to register on the tongue. Perhaps my hat might have more flavor.Ordered some Marmite to go w/ it; maybe that will help. Unfortunately, the item is not returnable or I would have chosen that option: this is THAT bad."
4,very cool horror/mockumentary,"After watching the movie once I just thought it was average.I mean the acting was good especially Nathan Baesel and the whole idea of a crew filming a serial killer was cool.However I didn't really catch all the cleverness the first time.After watching it again I have to say this is prolly one of the better horror movies of the year.Its funny,clever and the last part has great horror/slasher elements to it.Everyone that gets a chance should check this out to see a cool and unique movie.Leslie Vernon is a great character."
5,Great Mockumentary,"I found this movie while searching On Demand from AT&T and decided to watch it just for some B-rated horror thrills. However I was completely captivated by this movie. Anyone who is a fanatic for either the horror, comedy, or mockumentary genres, this movie is for you. The layout of the film is, ""What if Jason Voorhes brought along a film crew for the entire process but he also is darkly witty."" This movie goes over every possible stereotype of the early horror films and makes light of how predictable a horror movie can be. However don't let that lead you astray, this is one the funniest and darkest movies ever made. Watch it you won't be dissapointed."
4,this is not a slasher movie,"The cover art really kept me from seeing this one, and then one night out of boredom actually rented it. Boy did I ever get a pleasant surprise. This movie is more or less a documentary on an up and coming serial killer who will openly share his preparation, techniques, as well as allow the film crew into a history lesson of why society needs serial killers. I found it, as well as a few friends, quite enjoyable and funny."
2,The Blu-ray release is Movie Only!,"I am very disappointed that the Blu-ray release of BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON has NO extras; not even a pop up menu! I rate the movie 4 stars and recommend the standard DVD with its Audio Commentary, making of and casting of featurettes, and Deleted/Extended scenes."
4,"Excellent Lead Actor, Good Story, Funny Dialogue","Behind the Mask is a real gem in the usual costume-jewelry junk pile of ""horror/comedies"" in that it is able to make fun of the clichés (as well as geek out, without alienating a less-than-knowing audience), while proving that these clichés became such for a good reason: they work. For the first hour, the movie is a straight-on mockumentary, then it takes a turn and becomes a classic stab-and-slab old-school horror movie."
2,"Great movie, Terrible Blu-Ray","Anchor Bay has really dropped the ball on their recent Blu-Ray releases, and Behind the Mask is no exception. While the movie is great (I'd easily give it 4/5 stars) and it looks and sounds alright (it's shot documentary style so it looks a bit grainy but it's supposed to) there are no special features to speak of. Not even a simple menu. Now I would have understood if there weren't any NEW special features or if they were not in HD (this happens quite a bit sadly) but NONE AT ALL? The DVD had them...why exclude them? If you're interested in owning Behind the Mask I recommend seeking out the DVD and if you already own it don't bother upgrading. Knowing Anchor Bay they'll release another version in a year anyways."
2,OK for horror completists,"""Behind the Mask"" is a great concept that is executed poorly. The two exceptions are Robert Englund (of course, he's an amazing actor in anything) and Nathan Baesel as Leslie Vernon. Baesel singlehandedly carries this entire movie. His energy and enthusiasm pull up the remainder of the movie almost to his level. Baesel manages to make his serial killer likeable, and gets you on his side. It would have been strictly amateur hour if he had not been in this film. IMDB shows that Baesel has worked steadily since this movie, and I'm not surprised. For horror fans, this may be an acceptable time killer; for non horror fans, this will not be entertaining in the least. Rent before you buy."
3,no special features kinda negates the purpose,"First off let me state that I love this movie, but as has been pointed out by other reviewers the lack of special features really hurts this release. I would recommend getting the DVD version that has all the special features and hope that in the future anchor bay releases a BD edition that is worth the purchase. On a side (ish) note, I'm really kinda peeved that this edition WAS listed as having at least a few special features. The fact that it has NONE is at the least borderline false advertising. With that rant out of the way I do highly recommend this movie. Just not on BD until they improve it."
3,Amazon Instant Video Review,"This review is for the digital Amazon Instant Video version of Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon. The movie is fantastic, one of my favorites. I finally decided to purchase it and went with the digital version of the movie. I have purchased digital SD movies from Amazon in the past and have had no issues with them, however Behind the Mask suffers from light to medium screen tearing through most of the movie, mostly when the action is moving quickly on the screen. Unfortunately since this is filmed almost entirely from a documentary perspective, with the camera movements this happens quite a bit. If you can get past that it is watchable but it can get bothersome on the eyes after a while."
3,"Great movie, ZERO features","Can someone explain to me why this doesn't have the commentary that was included on the dvd? Very disappointed. No commentary, no subtitles, no nothing. So strange."
1,Sleeper!! Don't bother buying...it's better rented...if at all,"I love my horror movies. Straight to the point stalker/slasher/murderer/hauntings, etc., but this documentory type horror movie was totally boring. I think the plot of the story was stupid and then unfolding the movie was even worse. Don't waste your time buying this one."
2,OVER-RATED!!!!,"One of the most over-rated film I've seen this year. I found this film niether funny, scary or anything. And it's not that original. I don't know how anyone can say that this is a must for horror fans. If you want to see a film like this that is a ""must for horror fans"", pick up a copy of ""Man Bites Dog"", and leave this film on the shelf"
1,"Great Premise, Weak Delivery","The premise sounds interesting. A film crew following a would-be serial killer preparing for his first kill. Unfortunately, the director couldn't keep a straight face and ruined such a great setup almost immediately. First of all, why is there another camera filming the film crew if there's only one cameraman in the movie? If they had followed the example of Blair Witch and at least pretend that the whole thing was real, this could have been a little gem.Another advice to the director: If this movie is pretend to be a documentary, don't hire actor that's well known in the genre. Once he shows his face, everyone know that the whole thing is a fake. As much as it might have been the director's wet dream to work with such legend, his presence destroyed the entire movie.Overall, the movie isn't scary and I wonder if it would have been better as comedy. No, I guess it wouldn't. They borrowed great deal from many films and there was hardly anything original about the movie."
1,Superdooper Dud!,"This film is an overrated unfunny and scareless turkey, poor writing, amatuerish directing, ham fisted acting, poor special FX, and a slow plodding pace(that forced me to fast forward quite a bit) sink this dud. I have a feeling the good reviews this film has recieved are friends and relatives of the director. Avoid at all costs."
1,Awful,"This movie was awful. If you waste your money on it, the you deserve to lose your cash. The acting, the dialog, the effects, the storyline, everything was horrible. I've seen better acting from extras in godzilla movies."
1,save your money,"As a person who views many films, and personally owns a huge library of movies, I have to say this is not a film that should have made it to DVD or any other form of viewing. The acting was terrible. So was everything else. This is the first time I actually could not sit through the footage. The writer may of had an idea of some nut case taking a cue from slasher movies, to go around murdering people, but at least get people that can act, or at least want to try and act the parts. I say to all ; Save your money !"
1,DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE,"AGAIN IM I WAS DISSAPOINTED FROM A MOVIE THAT ANCHORE BAY PUT OUT.DONT GET ME WRONG, ANCHOR DOES A FINE JOB FOR CULT CLASSIC HORROR MOVIE BUT THE NEW STUFF THEY PUT OUT IS JUST HORRIBLE.I WATCH THE FIRST 30 MIN AND THE DVD IS NOW AT THE POWN SHOP.DONT WAIST TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS"
5,ULTRA PIZZAZZ!!,"Out of all the really great female ""saloon singers"", no other can even approach the way Jeri puts over a song! Her interpretation grabs you in the gut -- especially one that seems to have been written and performed exclusively for you. I have added this to my shopping cart. My original album of Jeri Southern at the Crescendo at 33 1/3 was not only worn out, but stolen. This is a Mother's Day gift from myself to me. Thanks. Pat Sims"
5,Finding what I needed to restore my drill,"This was exactly what I needed to restore a great and useful tool that was just too good to throw away.The price came down to what I thought was reasonable ,perfect for me.I like being able to get what I need in the tool line without running all over. We live in the mountains and nothing is handy. It is 30 miles to even a Wal-mart."
4,Great product for an older Milwaukee drill ...,"Great replacement product for my old Ni-Cad batteries that originally came with my Milwaukee drill about 16 years ago. The original Ni-Cads eventually would no longer hold a charge and I thought I was going to have to throw my drill away. As it turned out, these are actually rated with a higher Amp-Hour rating than my original batteries. Good stuff."
2,Disappointed,The quality of this item is less than I expected. I would rather have this music done by well known artists in single CD's. The sound quality is poor at best. Some of the music I have on single CD's ie; Van Cliburn. The 1812 Overture sounds like a studio recording instead of cannons going off it sounds like a studio sound effect. In the future I will elect to buy Single recordings. (Please note: I have a box set of Beethoven 9 symphony's that is quite good)
3,imitation: the sincerest form of flattery?,"some have questioned what value is there to release a note-by-note cover album of the hits of one of the most successful pop groups of all time. frankly, I enjoy The Abba Generation more than the originals! ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" is the best example of the difference between the original, with the addition of synth layers and the nearly inhuman plastic-perfect voices of the girls. perhaps what most listeners find so disconcerting about this album is the almost overproduced, shiny quality of the songs. I find that to be what makes this album so irresistable-- Abba songs strike me as the sort that can take a bit of slickness and still remain listenable. they made some of the best pop singles of all time and a bit of ""updating"" for today's radio format does not hurt them."
2,"ABBA did it better, much better","I just wanted to say that these are all unoriginal songs. They belong to ABBA who sang them first and far better than A Teens or whatever they call themselves. People don't seem to get that little fact. I'm only 15 and I'm an ABBA fan. This cd is targetted towards tweens who probably have'nt heard of ABBA. If u want ABBA check out the real thing (""ABBA Gold""), don't settle for a sub par fake!"
1,THIS IS NOT ABBA!......THIS IS JUNK!,"First off how dare this band even try to copy any existence of the Swedish Quartet ABBA.Their classics ""Mamma Mia"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""Name of the Game"", ""SOS"", ""Souper Trouper"", etc...the list goes on.Each song does NO JUSTICE to the original. These are just a bunch of currently pretty teens copying on a classic.If you want these songs just buy ABBAs GOLD, why buy a corporation machine processed bands versions of 70 classic pop songs.It is like buying those compilations from Television with other unknown artists singing once great songs from RONCO...Absolutely horrible!"
2,Crap,"There doesn't seem to be anything new or different about this CD. A bunch of kids just took other people's songs and sang them (badly). Part of why ABBA was so awesome was that they were this Swedish band that wrote cool songs in English. Also, I read some review that said A*Teens sing better than ABBA. Um, I don't think so. I just listened to their version of Super Trouper, oh my gosh, it's terrible. Their singing voices definitely need some help, and it just really lacks that special something that ABBA had. It's just really boring. I heard Mamma Mia and liked it, until I heard ABBA's version, which is much better. Instead of this ripoff, just buy ABBA's Gold CD. By the way, I'm not some old person that's against new sounds. I'm 18 and I have seen the light! Haha. I really just discovered ABBA and I just don't like that most people my age only know A-Teen's version of Dancing Queen or whatever. The original is just so much better."
2,Imitation Is Not Always Flattery,So what's next? An English teen group who tries to carbon copy the Beatles? This is just the techno copy of the originals. The producers could have saved a lot of time and money by just re-mastering the Gold album with some techno tweeking.
5,Nice breezy techno-renderings of Abba classics,"Some people roll their eyes at any cover album, but this one manages to pull off the subject matter spectacularly, and in its own way.Songs like ""Mama Mia"" and ""Take A Chance On Me"" are given a rousing turbo-treatment, while others like ""One Of Us"" and ""Our Last Summer"" are turned into fun Ace Of Base like tracks that bounce and flow in a carefree way.The only track I did not care for was ""Dancing Queen"", which I feel was not quite up to par with the high standard set by the original version.Please note that in no way am I saying this is better than the original brilliance of Abba, but that it is extremely fun in its own right.Abba fans should really enjoy this."
5,Hello Abba Teens,"Hello again. I am listening to SOS and Mama Mia for an Nth time now and I love it more and more. Abba gave us a vision of music blended with words to create a pop sound that brings people together. Abba tunes were really meant to be trance anthems because they bring people together. I listen to you singing the words and I see a clarity of voices that show me my earliest memories. You pals are great, can I please, please, sing with you. Please come to America and visit us. Keep singing, absorb the energy of music."
4,DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE PRESS,"Despite the editorial reviewer's negative comments, there are some great reasons why this album was successful all over the world - it's fun and enjoyable. Take a chance on it. I think that the producers and performers did a great job of revitalizing some classic albeit tired Swedish disco."
5,Great!,"Why these kids arn't very well known is beyond me! They are great, they can sing and they really give the origional abba songs justice! You must get this CD!"
1,Don't bother get the original!,"Why listen to a bunch of kids play over produced versions of Abba's hits. Don't bother, if you like the songs get the original!"
2,Certainly Not ABBA,"Well, it's clearly a tribute band. They're okay, and thee songs are still catchy. Still dance-able. But no, they are not half as good as ABBA was. They are wannabees that don't measure up. The magic that was in the original is gone. It lacks feeling and purpose that the original has. The songs are still there, but the feeling is not. I don't entirely know why they even created this album; they sound like just another ABBA tribute band to me. If you want to experience the ABBA magic, get ABBA Gold or something. Just not this. After all, why mess with perfection?"
3,Okay,"This album contained only re-makes of old ABBA songs. The only songs that I genuinely enjoy are ""Mamma Mia"", which has a good beat and is fun to dance to, ""Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)"" because it also has a good beat and lyrics, and the A*Teens' biggest song on this album, ""Dancing Queen"". Personally, I enjoy A*Teens now that they've decided to sing their own music, because no one wants to constantly be listening to pop remixes of songs that went out long ago.I would recommend this album if you're getting into A*Teens, and want to hear what they were first like, or if you are/were an ABBA fan, and are looking for a more updated version of their songs.This review was brought to you by,GMM (Gold Mew Mew)"
1,0 stars possible?,"Can this become any worse? a bunch of talentless kids making an whole album with Abba covers. With a neo-disco sound they try to make the songs fresher, but they miserably fail. This is boring... If you like Abba then get their ""best of album"" if you like pop there are plenty of choises for you. ..."
4,ABBA Generation,"A Teens is a boy/girl group of teens ages 15 to 16. They are really talented singers, I thought it was kinda weird that they did a cover of the whole ABBA Cd, but they did a good job! Especially on ""Dancing Queen"""
4,Don't Judge Until You've Heard it!,"Now, for all the die-hard ABBA fans out there, or for anyone that's decided these four kids are lousy or just plain wrong to do covers of all the old ABBA classics... just five words: Don't Judge Until You've listened! I think these kids actually did a pretty good job, even with the modern techno-tweeks. The thing that gets me is that - while I LOVE the old group's work - is that these versions are actually compatible to today's dance scene! Finally, instead of some meaningless techno-pop drivel, some of the dance clubs out there can finally have some classic songs to dance too!Besides, this CD is just plain FUN!"
5,What a remake!,"So, these kids didn't write a song on the album, it's still good! The talent is what counts, and they- particularly Sara and Marie- have it! From the real dance songs- ""Mamma Mia"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""Take A Chance On Me""- to the slower songs with more meaning- ""One Of Us"", ""Lay All Your Love On Me"", ""Our Last Summer""- the CD is to be loved. Whether you like ABBA as a dance group or slower songs, you will love this recording for sure! if at first you don't like the songs, they will grow on you until you do. Great talent, mixed with great songs, and you've got an excellent CD!"
1,Unplayable CD due to copy protection,"I bought this CD to play on my computer at work. However, it has a copy protection software on it that Universal Music created back in the 1990s, and it crashes when you try to use it on a modern computer. The only way to ""open"" the CD is to let it install a piece of software on your computer called ""Universal Media Player"". That software is supposed to make the music tracks on the CD available to you. But when you try to start the music, the software crashes. Universal Music probably thought they were so brilliant back in 1999, but instead they've created worthless CDs. Oops!"
5,Abba Teens,"A-Teens' debut album, remakes 11 Abba covers. They actually sound a lot like Abba, like that 'old sounding' sound to it, only with a dancier beat. I recommend Abba Generation to anyone who likes Abba's music"
5,Dance Your Way Back to the Super 70s,"I just picked up this CD while I was in New York, and boy is it a fun return to my youth. The four members of the group sing well, and the songs have been updated so that they have the feeling of the originals with a new twist. Standouts on the CD include ""Mamma Mia,"" ""Gimme Gimme Gimme,"" ""Super Trouper"" (a current US single,) and ""Take a Chance on Me."" Take a chance on A Teens's THE ABBA GENERATION and you won't regret it."
5,"A- TEENS, clean","First of all, I was a huge ABBA fan as a kid. This new updated version is perfect for today's kids. As a mom, I have to worry about the inuendoes and contents of all the music. I am so glad that the A Teens are shining with cleanliness. My two kids enjoy them, too. The music on this CD still contains that bubble gum sound of the 70's and 80's but isn't that why we listened to ABBA in the first place? They are the best copy of the original. Buy this CD!"
3,pretty cool,i liked this cd a lot the songs are very catchy. they are thekind that get stuck in your head. its cool because at theend of the cd it got this song and it goes through all of thesongs on the cd.
4,take a chance on them,"Their voices are pretty good and they do a nice job with the material, and the musicianship/studio work is top notch. I'm an old ABBA fan and still _mostly_ prefer the originals but bless the A-Teens for bringing this music to a new audience...the songs would survive anyway but this is fun, pleasant stuff!I saw there was a bonus track of ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" on the hideously expensive Japanese import so I downloaded it on Napster (yeah, so shoot me). Ah, the wages of sin. The original is one of ABBA's best harmony pieces, but the remake suffers by comparison...their voices aren't quite robust enough to carry it off. Save your money and get the cheaper version of this CD."
1,Why?,"The A-Teens album is a bunch of teenyboppers mouthing popular Abba tunes in flat, unemotionless voices. Gone is the magic of Frida or Agnetha's vocals. Even the music is dull and uninspirational. Some techno tweaking does not a fine dance album make. Being a trance/electronica and a huge Abba fan, I thought that an updated version of Abba classics would make a fine listen..well, I guess I was wrong. Listening to this CD of unimaginative Abba cover versions makes this reviewer wonder........why?"
1,Disappointed.... 8 (,"Love the kids. Love the songs. And love the new and upbeat renditions. Disappointingly, the re-recordings are truly bad. Bass is muddy and over-stated, and the vocals sound like they are coming out of a transistor radio from the next room over. If you enjoy listening to your favorites a little loud, you won't be able to crank these up without splitting your ears. I suggest buying the original sound tracks and stay away from the hits-type collections."
4,Mama Mia,"Abba is back with A TEENS. There a great band with great voices. I really enjoyed this C.D but, It wasnt great. Most of the songs are really good but some are just o.k. . But its a really good cd. i would recomend it."
1,Are you kidding me?,Are you kidding me? If you really want to listen to songs by ABBA then go by their CD. These kids didn;t write any of these songs and shouldn't be given any praise for just putting songs that have already been written by another band on a CD with their name on it. It's just stupid. One more wannabe group hits the market.
1,NO! WHY? OH WHY?,"I'am a huge fan of ABBA I love their music So when I heard these kids playing the music I love so much I thouht how could anyone allow this this to be done in such a tacky, rythemless, awful style as this? If I could give - stars I would give - to infinity its just that awful."
2,OH MY GOD!,"I saw the A Teens video for Dancing Queen on MTV the other day and just let me say I was disgusted, not because they are making a career of covering Abba songs, believe me I love Abba as much as the next guy, BUT Because their voices were so horrible, I could sing better than that if i was losing my voice, needless to say skip this crap and go for the reall Abba, because the A Teens are not worth it, besides no one will know who they are in a few years, probably even a couple of months."
1,Pointless,Why on erth why anybody want to buy this CD of Abba covers when one can listen to the originals which are vastly superior?
1,THIS IS SO BUBBLE GUM1,I HAVE LISTENED TO ABBA FOR 23 YEARS AND STILL LISTEN TO THEMTHIS IS THE WORST TRIBUTE BAND I HAVE EVER HEARD. ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME THERE IS NO VOCAL TALENT AT ALL IT'S ALL STUDIO SOUND GIVE ME THE REAL BAND ANY_DAY NOT SOME TEENAGE WANT TO BE BANDTHAT DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE SONGS.
5,Excellent,"I loved this. But I am fascinated with the Native American struggle, so this was just what I was looking for. The struggle, the ritual, the honor involved with the people of that day - it makes me respect the culture so much. I feel horrible about the way they are/have been treated. Even though the story is many years old, unfortunatly it still applies."
3,"Good, but...","I truly wanted to like this book more than I did. I had read all the great reviews, and have read a great deal of Native American history. Black Elk's first-hand accounts of some of the most famous moments in American history are priceless, as was his description of Sioux culture; these easily rated five stars. But lengthy chunks of this book are descriptions of Black Elk's dream-like visions. They were obviously very personal, and Black Elk even wonders if he should try to recreate them for auhtor John Neihardt. For me, the re-telling of these visions through an interpreter and then written by a white man left the passages a convoluted and overly-detailed morass. I would, however, still recommend that anyone interested in Native American history read this book."
3,"Very interesting, scattered.","I did enjoy the book, but it also seemed like if you weren't either the author or the publisher, you won't be able to understand it."
2,gruesome battles,"I found this to be a very difficult read, particularly the gruesome battle descriptions. Black Elk's visions were hard to imagine, although they were described and redescribed throughout the book. Some stories were reminiscent of events in other religions of the world. I did not end this experience feeling spiritually uplifted, as I had I hoped I would."
2,white person speaks for native american - AGAIN,how can you suggest this book when the ending is the author's rather than black elk's words? this is another example of white people speaking FOR native americans. at the very least it misrepresents a great man's words and puts them in a white person's context. can we not get beyond writing for europeans?
4,Begin your path on the Red Road here.,"Black Elk is as visionary as Christ, Moses and Buddah. His story presented within the simple bounds of this book goes further than just the literary meaning. Throughout, the reader is always encouraged to search within, turn their eyes to themselves and listen to the spirit cradled there. He (Black Elk) has taught me to listen to my spirit. I hope anyone who reads this book does as much."
5,A Flicking Good Time!,"I had such a delightful time viewing this movie. This movie was one of India's top classic films. A definate must see, buy it today!"
4,A Classic - Must have,"This would definitely be one that you have to add to your collection if you are true Hindi Movie buff, especially classic movies. The songs are chillingly effective to keep you interested. It takes you back to the beautiful parts of India and at the same time deals with the issues surrounding true love and social/cultural values.A very simple depiction of complex situations with relationships and harsh realities of life. Some excellent direction with great outdoor photography.Top notch performances from stalwarts, Naseeruddin Shah, Rekha and Anuradha Patel. Being an older movie, the quality is not DVD grade, but it gives you the older rustic print taking you back in time."
2,doesn't work,these might work in older cars but if you have a newer one then don't waste your money since I tried them an the only thing they did is mess up the the whole brain that couldn't define the plugs. the car ran but misfired and burned more fuel so had to put back old plug and have the dealer recode the car
1,lots of hype.,"First off, Im an ASE certified technician. I installed a set of these in a 94 saturn SL1. It ran well for a few thousand miles and then began missing. Plug #3 had a crack in the porcelain. I replaced all 4 with AC Delco's and it ran great. I had also installed these E3's in a 05 Grand Prix and had the same problem with porcelain cracking after a few thousand miles. These plugs are a good idea but simply don't hold up. I guess I'll stick with what works."
1,Does not last,"Purchased these and installed 6 months ago. Already had one foul within 12,000 miles. I did not see a sufficient improvement in gas mileage and I do track fuel usage. I am sure it may improve gas mileage but for the fact they foul prematurely and the time it takes to replace it is not worth it."
2,E3 Spark plugs,"I bought a set of these for my 2005 PT Cruiser GT Turbo and paid $8.95 per plug. The plugs seemed to producemore power, yet made my car miss BIG time. There was a stumbling that was not there before the E3's. Ended up replacing the E3's with stock plugs and that took care of the missing/stumbling. Thankfully, the company refunded me for the plugs. ""If it sounds too good to be true it probably is"" Better mileage? More power? Big mistake buying the E3's."
1,misfire,"Purchased these plugs for my silverado 6.0LThey ran good for a couple of days then misfired every timeFinally, replaced with bosch plugs and no more problems"
1,RF Problems with E3 Plugs,"Put a set of E3's in my Ford explorer. Started throwing a bad cam sensor error code. Replaced the cam sensor and servo, same error code. Replaced the plugs with the Accel's that were in there before and no more error code. The E3's are apparently not insulated properly (which may be why so many complain about failure) and they can and do put out stray radio frequencies that the computer cannot understand. Wouldn't waste my money on E3's."
1,Not a good experience.,"I saw these plugs advertised on the show Gearz TV. The claim was improved gas mileage over standard plugs. Maybe so but I couldn't run them long enough to find out. One of the plugs fouled out in about 2 weeks and according to the markings on the ceramics on the business end of the plugs, a second one was well on its way to fouling out. I had a ASE Certified Master Mechanic check my truck after it started running ruff and his computer identified the bad plug. We changed them out and went back to the AC plugs and all is well. The only bad thing is I had to send them back to Amazon and only got $38 of my original $48 purchase back and that is after I had to pay a mechanic $50 for a diagnoses and another $60 for the AC plugs and installation. ""Live and learn!"". rc"
2,Missing Songs,"This CD sucks. I love los autenticos decadentes, but this CD with the greatest hits is missing...well...the greatest hits. Don't get me wrong, I love all of the songs in it, it's just they are missing a lot of better songs that could have been included. Avoid this version at all costs and go for either ""Los Reyes de la Cancion"" or ""20 Éxitos Originales."" Those are little more expensive, but will give you a better compilation of their master works."
3,autentico,"i watched these guys live in santiago, chile for the universidad de chile ""o week"" conert and had a wildly entertaining night!theyre definately a group worth hearing live which in some ways listening to them on CD doesnt do them credit.this album is still highly enjoyable although it is missing one of their best songs ""el murguero""."
5,"Excellent, humorous in spots, war of wills.","A top exec troubled by the business highway looks for a simplier life. Add a mother-to-be and a woodland cabin and Harrison is off on a unique adventure. Romantic? Well, Cleo is not as bemused with Harrison's practiced lines, handsome looks for affection. In fact, she becomes the biggest challenge Harrison has ever faced--Wall Street included!Great story!"
1,A Waste of Money,"My primary reason for the purchase of this product was to have an Italian DVD to use while walking on my treadmill. Before making the purchase, I reviewed all the Italian DVDs at my local library. Of the six DVDs that I was able to obtain this was one of the worst.I recommend ""Global Access Visual Passport Italian"" or ""Italian 101"" Both of these products are of far greater value and easier to use. Please note, I use these products solely as an adjunct to my Italian language CDs which are much more comprehensive"
5,A great design book,"When I ran the DTP group of the Boston Computer Society Roger was a favorite speaker. He has the gift of explaining design in terms anyone can understand, and this book can't fail to make you a better designer. It's the best design book I know."
5,nobody will ever write a book this good on Web design,"A paper design is self-explanatory and self-maintaining. This is why Roger Parker was able to write this superb book on design for paper. Web publishing involves collaborative maintenance of a collection of material. So one can never achieve such clarity. Anyway, this is a great book if you want to design some paper stuff and it is also good to think about why you'll never have it this easy in the Web world."
3,Not up to par,"I've liked most of the ""new pentangle"" but this CD is about 50% light jazz. The jazzy treatments of classic folk numbers are an interesting extension of Pentangle's original folk-rock (or was it really folk jazz??) fusion from decades ago. However, the jazz is not especially interesting and doesn't really form a good venue for Jacqui McShee's still lovely singing. Some of her other recent recordings are better than this one (Passe Avant and At the Little Theatre are both good)"
2,Adorable but flimsy,"I think this frog is very cute,but I did expect it to be a little bigger and fuller.They do give you the measurments,but it looks like there is nothing to it.Based on that ,the price should be a little less.It is very different though,and does look cute on my daughter's princess bed."
2,Not a great group of songs & CD disc is flawed!,"Not enthralled at all with this music, and the disc hangs up between the tracks.....It is NOT my cd player.....it does it on three players I have.....so I assume it is a fault in the disc creation! Anyway, it was not worth the $ to me. Sorry Rod"
3,IV is almost one too many,"Rod's first 3 songbook releases captivated me, but I found his latest to be a disappointment. Time to move on Rod.Difficult for me as a long time R.S. fan to admit, but there is just no magic here...."
3,"My least favorite of the four, but still a decent album","I loved the first three volumes, and this one wasn't quite as good, in my opinion. Maybe Rod is getting burned out, this one just didn't seem as ""soulful"" to me. On the other hand, I haven't listened to this one as much, so perhaps they'll grown on me as I hear them more. Although most of Rod's surprising duet choices have worked for me, I didn't really care for the Makin' Whoopee duet with Elton John. Their voices sound excellent together, but the song choice seemed weird. Again~that's just me. Enjoyable CD, but not ""rush out and buy"" quality."
1,soulless and bland,"I like pop standards,but made the mistake of buying this horriblecovers album instead of a compilation album of some of the originals.I'm sure Rod Stewart will release a 5th 'Great American Songbook' and a 6th and a 7th and an 8th.But I learned my lesson.And sold this to a used record store for a buck."
1,borrrrring,"no more please. This is another album, another piece of junk. Why do we even listen to this gunk. No way. I wont fall for it anymore."
1,A must not buy album of the year..,He can't sing..can hear that they edit his voice too much..jazzposer!
1,Milking a tired Cow enough now,"Rod Stewart ain't much of a Singer anymore&the Crooner thing is a Bad,bad Joke. He wrecks these Classic Songs&none of the Material stands out for me.while the Instrumentation is cool as well as the Arrangements you can't have somebody trying to Croon when the vocals sound very Froggy."
1,There are much better songbooks... Try Ella or Billie!!,"I think Rod Stewart is causing Billie Holiday to turn in her grave...Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn or how about Mark Murphy...all great vocal stylists. If you start here you may get the wrong idea that this what these songs are supposed to sound like...NO!!!Go buy Billie Holiday with Lester Young..."
1,Please Stop Singing These Songs Mr. Stewart...Please!,"No other artist can sing ""My Funny Valentine"" like Streisand. She set the benchmark and truly captured the sentiment(not setimentality) of the song. So..if an artist such as Mr."" great in his day but should now retire"", Stewart, wishes to cover this classic(not murder it), I suggest they step up to the plate and sing the song the way it is supposed to be sung...Dammit!"
1,Stewart Can't Sing,"Singing the Great American Songbook requires a singer--no a screecher. The material belongs to Sinatra, Damone, and Bennett and anyone else with a voice. The public should be spared from this garbage."
1,Sorry but he sounds like a lady,"Oh Rod - what happened? I loved you back with the Faces and your early solo stuff but this - this -this - how can I put it - is reallly baadddb, and I don't mean in a James Brown way. Frankly you sound like a lady and if I want to hear some classic ballads, I'll put on Frank Sinatra.So Rod, what gives? I'm sure you have enough money to retire in comfort, so please stop making a fool of yourself.Meanwhile, I'll put on 'Every Picture Tells a Story' - AHHH - now that's better."
1,He dissapoint me once more,He's talented..but this cd didn't showcase anything..it's so poppy..not my type...
1,Mumber 10 at Amzon?,how can this be?i mean..it's not a good album? how can he sell..anyway..i well reckon u buy this unless you are into stuff that can make you end up in mental hospital or go deaf and blind(the coverpage of him yucks wad)....
1,...how long can you beat a dead horse?,"...if you're Rod Stewert, as long as there's hair gel and dye and millions of nostalgic old folks who can't get over their youth in the 70's and reach out to the MILLIONS of other great CDs and bands out there, than you can beat a dead horse until you die with him/her...thanks Rod for another worthless album and thanks soccer moms for driving to Target to get this between soccer practice, Rod definitely deserves another million dollars while the new bands rot away because they can't afford to go on...SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL MUSIC SCENE and let Rod sit in his mansion and count his money"
1,SO awe...oops spelt wrongly..it's awful! not awesome!,awful..is this music? sounds like BING BANG BIANGdun buy!
1,Christmas is a nightmare if i play it..,Christmas is a nightmare if i play it on christmas day..people will turn deaf and some turn mad..i mean CRAZY. the rest will just faint and have to be sent into the hospital..this is how bad the JUNK can be..dissapointed..
1,"He should have gone home at American Idol ,not Ace ! He should retire !","Words fail me,you can fool some people some of the time.This man can fool the world all the time.I cannot think of one song that has not been sung better by someone else.He knows perfectly how to murder the great American Songbook.People don't take the time out to listen to people who can sing.I cried with laughter at his fist attempt, but this one defies logic.There must be some million people with cloth ears who bought these cds."
1,"No, no thanks to you, Rod.","Now you not only lost your voice, you lost a lot of people's respect too. It's a memory scarred me for life, man -- your ex-fan."
3,"Oh, so close.........","Rod knows he's hit on the right vein of music that has become so popular again so that's why this no.4 in the series is here.Unlike the very popular and handsome Michael Buble who lives and breathes this style of music, you can hear Rod struggle a little to sound genuine. Close, oh so close to sounding good....."
1,I'm amazed,in a negative way..he let me realised there can actually be such a talentless chap to create a album..yucks! go away!
1,OMG..,yucks..how can he still be a recodring artiste? his voice is so edited by the music box..bet he can't sing live..it's so obviouse to people with sharp ears..goodbye Rod! you've one less fan..ME!!!!!!!
1,Absolutely the worst...,"Having listened to Rod Stewart's first two albums of the American Songbook collection I have to say it was a little surprising that for the most part his performance, while certainly different, held its own. But I think that's where Rod should've left it. Certain songs he can sing and frankly on this album, he can't sing worth a damn. Being selective about his material would've helped, but with 4 cd's out there now with Rod singing the classics, it looks more like a box set and the desperate attempt of a has-been to keep his flagging career going when I fully agree with those that say he should retire."
1,Please no more.,"Enough is enough. You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time. Apparently you can fool all of the people that buy the Rod Stewart songbook series all of the time. When does it stop? Rod, you used to be so great. You rocked. What happened? I know we all get old but we don't have to get stupid. I thought you quit drinking? Oh well you can laugh all the way to the bank, after all George W. Bush was re-elected so I guess I can't blame you for making a buck off the same schmucks, but you won't find any of your latest in my collection. I still listen to the Faces, where did you go?"
2,growing old ungracefully,"I guess when you cant write songs anymore, you cover classics and showtunes for 40something stay at home moms. Who buys his 'songbook' collections, do you know anyone who owns one?Rod Stewart as a solo artist once made vibrant, frantic music somewhere between disco and rock. 'Young Turks' 'Do ya think Im Sexy' are edgy classics, that evoke an age and emotion, once you get past the trappings of their era.Rod did extend his career for a time by covering unknown songs of great merit 'Some guys' 'Downtown Train'. But it is just sad when there is nothing left in the tank, and crooning to the oldies, however smoothly, passes for artistic accomplishment."
3,Who are -you-?,"If you're a Rod Stewart fan -and- a fan of these tunes, go for it. If you're a fan of the rockng Rod, just be aware that this is not that Rod. If you're a fan of the tunes, but not of Rod, it's likely you already enjoy an older version of each of these tunes more than you'll like Rod's versions."
1,Last one...thank goodness,"I am a longtime fan of Rod Stewart but the Songbook series is simply awful. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE these songs. It is just that they are available by Sinatra, Tony Bennett and other great singers. These albums would have been fine if done by Frank Sinatra Jr. who has a history with the great American songbook. It isn't just the latest ""thing"" or ""phase"" with Frank Jr. Rod Stewart should go back to being Rod Stewart. This cd is the worst in the series and should come with an extra raspy warning. Rod is simply wrong for ALL of these classic songs. Buy Sinatra and Bennett and hear perfection."
1,A hardcore fan's opinon,"I own copies of every last note Rod Stewart has EVER recorded. This is not an exaggeration. This album sucks, plain and simple.One more album like this and I can start spending my money on things besides Rod Stewart."
4,Who Doesn't Like Rod Stewart,"He had a great idea and pulled it off so well. This fourth CD completes my collection of standards by Rod. It's good, it's wonderful."
1,ENOUGH ALREADY !!!,"This cd is boring. Now before I get abused, let me just say I am a lifelong Rod Stewart fan and I also have the 3 previous Songbook cd's by him. With each progressing one, they get worse and worse. The quality of the songs seem to get diluted. On this one, all the songs are starting to sound the same. The first one was the best one in my opinion, and had the prettiest melodies. It seems he is now just pumping these out so fast, without as much care into the song selection. The novelty has worn off on this , and I hope this is the last one. Get back to making a rockin' cd before it's too late Rod."
3,Thanks For The Memory...The Great America Songbook IV,He has gone to the well once too often. Lacks the enthusiasm of the first CD's. song selection mediocre.
2,ENOUGH ALREADY!,"These were never great versions to begin with but they are now starting to get worse. Rod is clearly bored with this material--no matter what he says in interviews. This is by far the worst of the series. If you must buy one--get either #3 or #1, but avoid this like the plague. NOTE TO CLIVE DAVIS: YES, you have proven you can sell anything now leave Rod Stewart and his millions alone. NOTE TO ROD STEWART: Now, how about making some good music again? You don't need any more money nor do your kids. Start working on what's left of your legacy. You were born to sing blues, soul and/or rock--so get after it soon. ANd stop being such a lazy bastard and write some songs again!"
1,never received it from seller,I sent the seller 2 notices and still never received my CD order. The Cd itself is a good product.
5,This is a great biography of the Empress Frederick.,Vicky: Princess Royal of England and German Empress is the best biography of the Empress Fredderick that I have read so far. Daphne Bennett is sympathetic to and interested in her subject. She set out to learn why the earlier biographical accounts of the character of the Empress Frederick differ so widely from her character as shown in her published letters. She points out that the Empress Frederick was a woman ahead of her time.
1,Unoriginal and Illogical,"The New Victorians is one of the worst books I have read about feminism. It contains no new insights and relies disturbingly on mistaken and simplistic historical notions about the Victorians. Denfeld ends up becoming so obsessed with the supposed commonalities between the Victorians and the feminists of today that she forgets to give an argument as to what exactly is so bad about the plethora of policies and people that she labels ""Victorian."" She takes the easy way out by using ""Victorian"" as some sort of epithet, apparently thinking that the reader is an idiot and will not notice the absence of any justification for her views.In addition to being devoid of any substantial argument, this book is simply unoriginal. Furthermore, it is written so poorly that it is painful to read. The author cannot write a decent paragraph and spends too much time writing about herself. I would not recommend wasting your money or your time on this book."
1,Worked for two days,"I unpacked my Tunestage II and had it installed and working in less than 10 minutes.During the first 2 days, the thing worked beautifully. Sound quality is amazing (I even compared connecting the ipod directly and through the transmitter and there is very little - almost imperceptible - difference). However, that was the only time it really worked.Now every time I turn on the transmitter, it quickly pairs with the receiver, and they work for a 5 -15 minute interval. Then the signal is completely lost, with lots of hiss, static, digitally polluted music. The devices keep trying to pair up again, but they simply give up after a while. Turning the system off and back on does nothing to help.I am now trying to figure out how to send it back to Belkin, as I live in Brazil and brought the unit with me on a recent trip.Unless they have a decent replacement, I would not recommend buying this product, even though there are all those great reviews out there."
1,does not work.,"Unfortunately, this cool idea is lost in the execution. It works for about 15 seconds and then the signal is lost. I reset it numerous times, I unplugged my phones, my wireless router and my microwave (as suggested) nothing worked. I'm taking it back after less than two hours."
4,great toad,"This arrived very fast ,they charged lots of postage to ship it . I like it and it looks just like the photo."
5,Wonderful Flick,"I had such a delightful time viewing this movie. This movie was one of India's top classic films. A definate must see, buy it today!"
3,She doesn't have a problem; she has a HEAP...,"Lacey doesn't just have a problem; she's got a load of emotional baggage topped off by an attitude a mile long & a humongous chip on her shoulder! She has a rocky homelife, but doesn't cope with it well at all. She's lucky to have Kristen for a friend; unfortunately, she doesn't realize it & treats Kristen like dirt most of the time. I can see why her dad & stepmom don't trust her; she lies to them & shoplifts! At the rate she's doing, she'll end up in jail by the time she's twenty!"
4,very enjoyable,"I may be 14, but I still liked the book. The way the author writes is very clear and concise. It lets Lacey and her problems seem realistic. I also love reading about Damon and Jessica so I give this book two thumbs up!"
5,Lacey's problem is being a shoplifter,"Lacey is being a snobby brat. Her best friend,Kristen Seltzer is now 8th grade president and she can't stand having someone else be friends with her. Lacey forgets Victoria[Lacey's stepmother's birthday] Victoria and Mr. Frells announce they are going to have another child. Penelope is Lacey's half sister. Lacey is grounded for missing Victoria's birthday,so she goes out and sees her boyfriend,Gel. One day,She walks into a drugstore without her purse and takes a lipstick without buying it. Same thing with the nail polish to give to Kristen,didn't the security cameras pick this up? one day at the Red Bird Mall,Lacey tries to get Kristen to shoplift a purse,and a guard catches her. Jessica is brought daisies by Damon at the dance and kissed on the cheek. Lacey has her best friend back and is grounded for 2 weeks or 2 months."
4,Great!,This book was about lacey wanting everyone to leave her alone. She's heard bad news from her family and the news was gonna ruin lacey's life. Her best friend Kristin noticed Lacey was acting strange and tries 2 help her but things just turn worse. I also recommend: Get Real & The Cool Crowd
5,My fave!,"I loved getting to know more about Lacey, because she's my fave SVJH character. Most people don't like her because she's got a really bad attitude and was mean to Jess. But that's why I like her. So give this a chance, it's pretty good."
2,uhmmm.....,"this book was dull. who cares bout lacey and her stupid problems? beleive me, dont waste your time"
5,Excellent!,"I have been very pleased with Milwaukee's batteries. I have been tempted to use a less expensive substitute product, but have not tried yet. I have never been disappointed with the Milwaukee."
3,just ok,i got this w the screwdriver. works fine doesnt fit as well as the one that came w the tool. may be defective but works and i got a good deal on it
3,Works well but jams into driver body,"The caps seem to be misaligned with the body of the battery. Although I can get it in there and it works fine, God forbid when its time to get it out. Very tough and onconvenient. Disappointed in the quality control. I have 3 of these Milwaukee drivers and none fit well so its definitely the batteries not the driver."
2,Battery Jam,"While the batteries work fine in my drill, they jam inside and can only be extracted with a pliers."
5,A great 2.4 Volt battery for a greater screwdriver,"I just love my Milwaukee screwdriver. Unfortunately I could not use it for a long time due to unavailibility of the battery. What a blessing to be able to get one from Amazon. I was so glad, I bought two."
3,Knock off battery,Battery's are good and work with charger but do not stop charging when at full charge like the Milwaukee batteries that came with unit. If left on the charger to long it may burn them up or possibly be a fire hazard . They have good power and the price was good but I thought I was getting original battery's.
5,Very good,"The older battery forked for 5 years, this n new one is very good as well. Used it for a whole day without recharging."
5,jeri southern in her finest hour,"jeri southern/you better go now is a wonderful album of songs that are one better than the other.this album has endored the test of time. it leaves you wanting more of jeri southern. she made wonderful singles in the 50,s this would be a great project for someone to put them on compact disc.if I can imagine anything if would be jeri southern in a recording studio doing a sequel to the album you better go now. she is great."
2,Low flow toilet flush handle by G,It's probably worth less than a dollar to manufacture. Takes forever for the low flush to work because you have to stand there and hold the handle down for the water to fill the toilet bowl. The high flush works okay. It's rather flimsy and I've had to caution little kids not to press on it too hard. The handle does not work with all toilet seats. The handle sticks too far out so I have to move the toilet tank cover to allow for the room and then it causes more condensation in the bathroom. I paid around $26.00 plus shipping I think. No I don't think it is worth it and would not recommend it unless the company gave you specs for the size of your toilet.
5,Great Winter Gift for Father!,Great gift for someone you love and keep him warm.A little pricy but totally worth it. I bought one more Marmot Parka for my Mother.
4,HOW COULD THEY HAVE NOT INCLUDED THIS ON THE STUDIO ALBUMS,"When artists record B-Sides, and other rare tracks that are not included in the final cut of the studio albums, it's usually because they're just simply bad songs that don't fit the standards of the album or the bandIn the case of 'No Doubt', I still wonder why they left these great songs out of their studio albums. The only songs that I have to say I didn't like that much were the remixes of 'Rock Steady', but other than that an excellent rarities album.But anyways, I'm thankful that No Doubt decided to put this collection out. It goes to show that even their rare tracks are as good as their studio album material."
2,Ok For The Price,I don't like to write bad reviews but I do always want to be honest and honestly this item is a bit of a let down. I can't really complain as it was just under $3.00 but it isn't quality by any means. The light itself is not very bright and the button to turn it on is right under the end of the clip. This may be a common place to put the on button but here the clip is pretty tight so it seems to turn itself on even with the slightest unwanted pressure. As far a pressing the on button it is very small so you have to make sure you press down just in the right spot or you'll be fiddling with it for sure.On the plus side I do like that it is reusable so you don't have to just throw it away - just pop in a new battery and it is good to go.Overall it is worth what I paid but not what I had hoped. I don't recommend the product I think there must be better lights without the issues I described maybe for a little more.Cheers!
3,"Works fine, batteries rattle inside it.","The penlight works fine but the batteries rattled around inside it. I folded up a small scrap of paper and stuffed it in there, which solved the problem."
2,Its a cheating,The title says its a white light. But its yellow. Its very low quality. This has happened second time with me with amazon
4,"Bright Lights, Big microorganism City!","I found this product to be perfect for my needs. I am in nursing school and had misplaced my other super awesome light. I wanted something cheap and durable. This one fit the bill. The pen light came out of the packaging as soon as I picked it up from where the delivery man left it, but I don't blame the seller for that necessarily. I can't wait to blind an eye or two with this! :)"
5,Love this!,Love this penlight. It's lightweight and fits into your pocket. Not to mention it's inexpensive. I would purchase this penlight again.
3,Built like a 3rd grade science project,"I bought two. Neither of them worked out of the package. The two halves were separated so I had to screw them together before use, but the two halves couldn't meet completely so I took them apart to see where the obstruction was. The light bulb was not seated properly; it was crooked. The bulb was a screw-on type, but the shaft didn't have any threads. I had to wiggle it until it appeared straight. The spring on the ""negative"" side of the battery pole was also crooked, preventing me from screwing the two halves together. After some prodding & adjusting, I got both of them to work well, but it bothers me that the bulb on one of them seems to refuse to be straight. At least they're only 3 bucks a piece."
5,Dr Castlle's penlight,"Our onocologist had broken his light and we looked for a replacement for him without him knowing.After shopping in some of the local stores we could not find what we were looking for. After shopping on the internet we decided that the product that was listed on Amazon was what we were looking for.When the penlight arrive we were amazed of the high quality of the item and the prompt delivery. So far I have never been dissapointed with any orders that I have placed with Amazon.Keep up the good work, John"
1,Not reusable,"The penlight does not have a place to open it to replace a battery. This is the same penlight as the 6 pack penlights that have the pupil sizes on the side. Instead of this, choose the 6 pack disposable penlights instead."
2,Disappoinment,I orderd 2 of these pen lights. One worked and the other never worked. I am disappointed because I do not have time to return the small item. What a disappointment!
1,Looks tacky IRL,This penlight looked garish and tacky and not sleek like I thought it would be. I don't even use it and got a better light that clips on to my stethescope for work.
4,Great service great product.,Was a gift for my boyfriend. Got it in two days! My boyfriend is going to love it. He is a emt and in paramedic school and has been wanting one forever!
1,Where is my stuff,It's been nearly a week and my merchandise hasn't shipped yet. The status says it was in stock and usually I have no problem with recieving my things from Amazon. But this is for school and I need it now.
1,NO GOOD!,"This Penlight is very cheap made, Don't waste your money. It keeps falling apart and the lights comes on by itself killing the battery."
2,It worked for a few days and then didn't work any longer.,It only worked for a few days and then did not work any longer. I replaced the batteries and that did not solve the problem. I'm not sure why it quit working.
2,light is too weak,the light won't give a pupillary response unless it is right in someone's eye thus making it pretty much useless.
5,practical,"love the reusable feature, also the metal for easy disinfecting regularly, stands up well frequent usage. thx u very much"
3,Good size but,Good size and weight for easy use. However the bulb blew with only three clicks. The bulb was hard to find and cost more that the item.
2,Light Came Off-Center,"Just got this today. Opened it up, and the light isn't straight. Aka, if you go to check someone's right eye, the light will probably hit them in between the eyes instead of your intended target. This is exactly why I needed a new penlight, however my last one made it a couple years before the light got messed up. I tried adjusting it with no luck. Pretty disappointed, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Only worked once,"Received product ahead of time, but it only worked once after i got it. I Changed the batteries and it still does not work. Poor investment, even if it was inexpensive. I didn't even get my money's worth."
1,Total Junk,Avoid this pen. I recieved it brand new and the light wasnt even centered in the pen. Its extremely cheaply made and really a joke. Buy a dorcy!
1,No quality,"One end of the metal is crooked, it does not work properly and is difficult regardless, I hate spending money on stuff i know i wont take the time to mail back"
2,Threads deformed after only a few uses.,Threads deformed after only a few uses. Also saw metal shavings in my pressings. Get a better one you will be happier.
4,A True Indian Epic!,"In my humble opinion, this is one of India's greatest films of the 1990s. The wealth on talent on show has never been equalled in any other indian film.The story is basically about two warring families in Rajisthan, and how various members of each family try to end this feud. The film climaxes with a brilliantly choreographed fight sequence between Sunny Deol and Sanjay Dutt. The scenery and musical score during this fight is magnificent, as it is during most of the duration of the movie. My only gripe is the slightly corny scenes set in the UK.Considering the epic storyline being told over two generations, and the large number of characters involved, I get the feeling that the version I saw (which runs for about 180 minutes) had been edited significantly to reduce it to a sensible running time. I would love to see the full version as it would help to flesh out some of the characters.All in all, its another brilliant movie from one of my favourite directors, J P Dutta."
4,Wonderful Flick,"This was a wonderful flick. I have seen it many times and enjoy it every time! Truly a Hindi Classic. A must see, buy it today!"
4,Not at these prices,I just ordered this book--New--from another supplier for $11.50 so why would any sane person pay the prices these sellers are trying to charge.
1,Battery Is Weak and Fails To Hold A Charge Well,One of the two Lithium Ion Batteries that I received was rated with only a 600mAh rating. This battery is WEAK and does not hold a charge well at all. It holds a charge only slightly better than my 3-year old battery that I was replacing.
2,Spend your money elsewhere,This toy looks like fun -- but it has way too many little pieces and once it was taken apart my 7 year old couldn't get it back together. It's been sitting in a storage bin n her room ever since. Soon to be put in the garage sale pile!
1,mr.wong dvd,"Besides the race issue, this cartoon just has very little entertainment value. The drawing is really hideous, the jokes(if they are jokes at all) are not funny, and you get a rather unpleasant feeling after watching it. Some racial satires are funny because they make fun of real life people. But when was the last time you've seen a 75 yr old chinese guy who's indestructible, can swear really well in english, and works for free for a single white female? The creator of this cartoon claims that it's a satire on racism. But the satire is nowhere in sight. The film is really about wartime desensitization in practice: give a reason to bring harm to a group of people(cuz they swear and they are ugly), imagine them to be subservient, and actually bringing harm to them. If you are someone who hates certain group of people and wish to bring harm to them but can't, this cartoon might appeal to you. Otherwise it's just a complete waste of time."
2,Prejudice here is a rittle one sided....,"I'd enjoy this if the stereotypes extended to other minority groups, as popular shows like ""King of the Hill"" and ""The Simpsons"" do, in equal judicious amounts. In this DVD, the joke falls solely on ""The Chinaman"". No one else. This singling out is what makes everyone uncomfortable and the humor substandard. Rickles, Mason, and other ""Race Humorists"" disperse their venom in unbaised portions, and that is when everyone can laugh. I gave this DVD 2 stars for its beautifully rendered art and retro appeal. Everything else is like eating Matzos sans aqua! Chitterlings mit no Tabasco. Tasteless. Take that, honkey! Just Kidding."
5,If you want politically incorrect humor that will make...,"...you laugh out loud, just purchase this DVD. Mr. Wong is an 85 year old Chinese houseboy who worked for Bing Crosby for 37 years. When Bing dies, his estate is purchased by Miss Pam, a super wealthy socialite, who soon learns that she has also purchased the services of Mr. Wong. Simply put, it is in your face humor that is funnier than hell. Of course, there are Asian groups who dislike it as Wong is the stereotypical Oriental flim flam man - he has buck teeth, a heavy accent, and he loves to gamble, drink, and curse. If you like ""in your face"" type humor, and you don't worry that every word you say is going to offend someone, then this is the DVD for you."
2,as an asian american..,"honestly, i don't care about racist jokes. if they are done right they are funny.unfortunately the majority of this dvd was just not that funny. the first episode was outrageously funny the way that south park is. then it goes steadily downhill, as its writers clearly didn't really have any good ideas beyond the premise of the show itself (as evidenced by the so-called 'music video' of the theme song thrown in about halfway through the dvd). by the time i got toward the end i couldn't wait for the stupid thing to be over."
1,what a racist piece of nonsensical crap,"this is essentially a racist piece of crap. i'm all for freedom of speech etc but you have to essentially draw the line somewhere. The jokes all hinge on poking fun at the chinaman character mr wong and has very little wit or substance unlike the simpsons or futurama. the producers must have been dropped on their heads when they were babies numerous times when they thought up this cringe, nausea-inducing piece of junk crap turd.... avoid at all cost."
3,New product for me,"Very volatile stuff much like lacquer thinner and should be used in well ventilated areas, preferably outdoors with protective gloves. This volatile liquid will penetrate wood pores but you must removes most of the rotted wood first. Apply with cheap disposable brush if you don't want to clean it with acetone. Two applications is suggested.I much prefer the thin two-part epoxy for wood rot/termite repair that hardens to a glass smooth and rock like filler. With the epoxy you could buy it with various viscosities for different repair applications."
5,Minwax has many uses:,I used the minwax for wood stabilizing wood for knife handles. This is the best product I've ever used for this.
3,Minwax Wood Hardner,"My husband and I do wood-working and some times the small pieces of wood used for either chess sets or pens can be soft in places. We were trying to find something that would help harden these places. This wood hardner worked so-so. I felt like it should have hardened the wood a litle more than it did. I can tell you that none of the big box stores, or the SW Paint stores have it, or will even try to obtain it for you. Amazon is the ONLY place we could find to get it."
5,Better than the first . . .,"This is one item where the sequel is truly better than the original. Oh, sorry, that was ""The Godfather, Part 2"" . . . oh, and ""Aliens"".Seriously, no, this book was in great shape, albeit it arriving just in the nick of time for Christmas. It took nearly three weeks and sat in the Denver USPS facility for six days before those unionized hacks got off their duffs."
4,Super System 2,The recepient of this gift had read the previous book and was delighted to add this one to his collection. It was shipped promptly and arrived in great condition.
4,As Advertised,I'd do business with this Co. again. All was as stated. I would use UPS instead of PP-slow-slow
4,Stop Doyle Bashing!!,"Although I'm not DBs biggest fan (more a TJ Cloutier man myself), I do appreciate his achievements, and to say he hasn't won a tournament since his last book is just ridiculus, 2003 Legends tourney, 2003 WSOP H.O.R.S.E tourney etc etc... the list is huge, not to mention the many cash finishes like at the 2004 WSOP"
3,I must disagree...,"To the folks dissing Doyle Brunson, whoa, just wait a minute here!Oh no, he's not won a tourney for years? Well, have you? On a consistent basis he still makes it to the final table against the greatest players in the world today. Have you?Most of us out there will never enter tourneys on a regular basis. Most of us will play a regular game, perhaps, and the occasional jaunt into the casino. With a book like this, we're given a better chance to succeed as the hope is that your friends around the table haven't read it.Stop all this nonsense and see the book as what it is - a well-versed guide to improve your game.Shuffle up & deal!"
3,Help you to win the game,The cotents of this book help you:1.the first step to know the game's rule2.the second step to know your competitors in the table3.simple and easy way to improve your poker's skills4.step by step know the poker's pro retionalsyou can chose win or lose in the games after this book reading
3,Okay book but has a mix of everything in one.,This is an okay book but does not have a lot of emphasis on one game.
3,Very disappointed having read original super system...,"Was looking forward to new material and with all the hype this book got, this was a huge disappointment. Whats really annoying is doyles plugging his online site over and over.... and endless self praise (which i think is disgrace).I enjoyed reading original Super System and think that is better book to start with. And if you have read the orig super system, you dont need to waste money on this one at all."
4,Good but not great,"If you have bought the first super system then don't waste your money on this one. It basically is super system one on doyles part. If you want the other authors views on stud, draw ect... then but it."
5,"""Secrets From the Games' Best""","I have played poker for three years. I have been average a lot of this time. This book deals with a variety of games. I mainly read it though for poker's national past time no limit Texas Hold'em. I wasn't dissapointed. Doyle Brunson wrote many pages on strategies and many other things. Unlike Phil Hellmuth, he doesn't say, oh I'm the best poker player in the world. I'm going to cheat you out of your money so you will by my book and hear crao that i will tell you. This section is well done. I also enjoyed the other sections and can play more than one game now. This book is immensely helpful and a great read. I have raked in a lot of winnings and have drastically improved. This is the first book about poker I have read and definatley not my last. I completely recomend this book."
2,Better left unpublished,"Doyles section is basically the same and is why it got 2 stars in the first place. I feel the poker pros were not used properly for this book. Daniel negranu is a coward for doing three card draw that has no merit on real card tables and he should of just declined it in the first place,he is a no limit and omaha 8 or better expert and should of wrote on that instead. Bobby baldwin was the most sound poker player during his time, kind of like alan cunningham of today. So I dont know why he didnt write the limit chapter again, I think modern day limit players would have really been in for a treat. I have nothing against jeniffer harmen writing it but I think it was better served for baldwin. Please save your money and dont buy this book. If need be they should have it at your local library."
3,Not as Detailed as I Expected (review for NL and Limit Hold'em sections),"This book has good information for a newbie, but I've been playing poker for 4 years and it really didn't provide me with any new or insightful strategies. This was the first poker book I have ever read, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I thought it would go into specific details such as hand analysis, timing, bet amounts and so forth...but the details are not there...he may say, ""I'll put in a big bet or overbet,"" but that's about it. Mike Caro's section on ""tells"", however, is decently insightful. Since I mostly play online, I'll look forward to applying this info next time I go to the casino. But overall, if you're already relatively versed in poker strategy, this book will do you little good."
4,"Cute Backpack, needs more storage",My 3 year old son loves his LeapPad backpack! He carries it every where we go. I liked the thought of having a place to store all of his books and cartridges. However there is only room for 3 extra books and cartridges. I would give this backpack an A+ if there was just more room to store books and cartridges.
4,"Great for easy travel, but not enough storage","We bought this for my middle child (will be passed on to the youngest in a couple years) and I was a little disappointed in the storage (or lack of.) There are only 3 book and 3 cartridge slots, you can fit more in but they seem to stretch out when you do that. They should have built it more like the LeapPad Storage Organizer my older daughter has. Other than that, it works or what it is made for."
3,its ok,"this product is a bag for the leappad, there is nothing super special about it...what else is there to say."
3,Good bag to hold couple of books and a small toy.,"I bought this bag for my nephew to carry his fisher price pad. But then this was too small for it. I really liked the design of this bag. He loved it and used it to carry couple of books and a small toy.Even if it had accomodated the pad, it will be heavy for him to carry."
5,Better,"I purchased an M18 set a couple years back, which included a contractor bag. Love the set, but the bag has always been seriously undersized for the hammer drill, sawzall, circ saw, worklight, 2 XC batteries and charger. Plus I've purchased a couple other M18 tools since then so my original bag flowith over. I received this bag a few weeks back (bonus points for quick shipping) and I have been very happy with it so far. I'm not a contractor, but I do carry my tools with me a lot and having two bags now is a convenience well worth the $33. This bag is not as long as my original bag, but the height and width is about the same and it has a ton more extras. I don't think I have enough small stuff to fill all the pockets on the inside and outside of this bag, but it's nice to have the options. I am digging the built-in circ blade holder, perfect for my extra 6 1/2"" blades."
1,terrible bag (built by a cheap company for milwaukee to sell with the milwaukee name printed on it),well i guess my title says most of it.my zipper failed within 8 days of use.no warranties honored with this company any more.id recommend a nice bosch or makita bag.
3,Read other Boice Works,"I'm a huge fan of Robert Boice and believe that his thoughts about how to overcome procrastination and writer's block are seminal. He is one of the few people who has done research on how to help people overcome procrastination and increase their scholarly productivity.However, unless you are (like me) a Boice addict, I would suggest starting with his other works -- especially ""Professors as Writers"" and ""Advice to New Faculty Members"". Most of his books are quite repetitive and rather plodding -- but his ideas are life-changing.I'm a clinical psychologist and professional coach and I use his theories and interventions all the time when I counsel students, faculty and fiction writers."
1,EWWWWV UGLY,"THIS MY SCENE DOLL IS TERRIBLY UGLY. HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE LIKE IT? IT IS UGLY AND HORRIFYING. BRATZ DOLLS ARE TOTALLY BETTER. AND THE MY SCENE DOLLS COPIED THE BRATZ AGAIN. THE BRATZ HAVE A HOLLYWOOD ONE. BUT THE BRATZ ONES ARE BETTER. THEY ARE PRETTIER AND HAVE BETTER CLOTHES. I DON'T CARE IF IT IS THE SAME OUTFIT THE NEW YEARS YASMIN HAS, I DON'T HAVE HER SO, I WANT THEM BOTH. THIS DOLL IS UGLY AND HER CLOTHES ARE UGLY TOO. MY SCENE DOLLS ARE LAME."
1,That is low girl that is low,"Just becuase someone says they think this doll is stupid (which I think this doll is) your going to come and kill someone. Yeah right. You don't even know my name and you don't even know where I live. Anyways, I think Bratz dolls are better. But that is my opinion, and I think My Scene dolls are stupid, and that is my opinion. And what is it with My Scene dolls copying Bratz dolls. The Bratz already have a Holleywood collection. I already knew what they looked like way before I saw this doll. Bratz are cool and My Scene dolls are not."
1,Shut the f*ck up,"Okay, this is leweez10, and you shut up. that is tellibly mena of you to say that. Do you want her dead or something? Because you are a selfish and spoiled jerk that shouldn't say harsh words like that. See, My Scene dolls, and fans are meaner and snobier. and Bratz are 100% times better. They are 100% pretteir, and their clothes are 100% inapropriate and cooler. My Scene dolls are fugly and retarded. They will never beat Bratz. And FYI, the Bratz have their own TV show, if you don't belive me, on Saturday morning, at 9/8c, turn your TV to 4kids.tv, and you will see yourself. Bratz rock, My Scene dolls suck. So get over it. Oh and jealous, of those ugly and pathetic My Scene dolls, ha-ha, you are definitly joking because that is so not true. YOUR the one jealous, just admit it. and also, My Scene dolls are fat, they have big boobs and butts, and they have long necks, and sloppy lips. So put a sock in it you pathetic My Scene fan."
2,brats fans read me,"you guys think that my scene girls are giraffes bacause they have long necks but you just making fun of my culture you fugly sluts in my culture it is beautiful to have a long neck thats why we put rings around themm starting from when we are babies so we can have long necks. i hate you and i hope you burn in helllove forever,camil'la :)"
1,STOP!!,Stop!attion all bratz and myscene fans.Im only going to tell u 4 words stop acting like babys.Bratz are the best and myscene r cool and to ever this fariy tale princess is enough already.i said bratz are the best because i like them more and myscene are cool because i only like that Linsay Lohan doll.one last thing u dont go writing reviews if u dont even like mysene or bratz because its inaproprite.

3,Huh,Limo Dressing room Lindsay Whatever Cool How did you knowthat Well ok if that true al beleve you
4,The new thing,"Honestly, I think these dolls are so ugly they're practically grotesque...however the kids seem to like them and so long as they're happy I'm happy. They do come with a lot more stuff than I remember getting with my Barbies 20 years ago, so that's a plus. Still...I can't get over the big heads and too much make-up."
5,My Scene is better,"Dear Fairy tale princess, i hope you go back to your real home, the ocean and then drown in it because i am sick and tired of hearing your wining complaints about my scene dolls. face it your just jealous about how pretty they are compared to bratz. my Scene are better because they acually have feet. bratz just have little nobs that you stick in shoes. that means that they can never go bare foot if you are pretending to go to the beach and having them surf while my scene dolls can just take of there shoes and ""feel"" the sand between there toes. =)"
5,Few things to say:::,"Beautiful doll and series! Can't wait for them to come to Saskatoon (where I live). I also can't wait for TRU to get My Scene Goes Hollywood Lindsay Lohan doll, limo, and dressing room!!!!! The movie comes out August 30/2005!!! Suh-WEET!!Thanx for reading and stop the My Scene/Bratz conflict!#1 My Scene Fan"
5,The my scene dolls are rock starz!!!!!,"This is the best collection of the my scene dolls.Barbie is beautiful,and cute,and all the my scene dolls are beautiful.There are some people how is writing bad reviews about the my scene dolls,and this is sooooooo bad.By the way,whats wrong the my scene dolls?They are not ugly at all.Just stop writing bad reviews about the my scene dolls.They are not ugly or creepy or slutty or whatever......This thing makes me sick.P.S.Bratz dolls are not the best."
4,She is very cute!!!(End the doll war Morgan and Fairytale princess),"Do you know what???The my scene goes Hollywood collection is awsome.I like this one,but I like Madison better.I have to say that:End the doll war.Why are you fighting about something made of plastic???These things you see are just for fun.And please Morgan and Fairytale Princess.Can you please end the doll war???But I don`t mean that you must go away from amazon.You can write what ever you won`t,but don`t say that my scene dolls suck.MY SCENE RULEZ!!!"
3,A good reference CD,"As bassists, we owe it to ourselves to listen to the recordings of our colleagues from all over the world. We may hear a piece performed in a manner different than our own, or we may hear a different turn of a phrase. All of this makes for exciting listening.Sadly, however, such is not the case on this CD. From the first note to the last, one hears little more than a professional bassist cranking out note after note. Granted, the good intonation is refreshing, but I would like to hear a bit of phrasing and emotion. This is a pedantic, academic, no-frills, note-by-note CD. Not all Russians play in such a dispassionate manner, but Mr. Sztankov does."
1,eurotalk talkmore russian beginners+,"i was very disppointed with this interactive dvd. previously i bought two eurotalk dvds in the russian series - the beginners eurotalk and the worldtalk, and was very satisfied with both. by contrast, the beginners+ did not allow the viewer/listener to build on the previous lessons as in the previous dvds. furthermore, when pictures and words were used together, the pictures had more than one subject content, so unless the viewer already knew the russian word, it was not possible to identify what word went with a particular image. as an aside, the male 'teacher' was extremely anoying in his mannerisms."
5,Great vest!,"This vest will be very useful! I got it for my husband for Christmas, as we are expecting our first baby soon. He thought it was a very unique idea and we think it will be very handy for him to use instead of a diaper bag! Lots of pockets with room for everything you need!"
2,"Received Orange Vest, NOT Blue","I registered for this vest in Blue on my Amazon Baby Registry. I was excited to see that one of our friends had bought it for me. Unfortunately, when it came in the mail, it was the ORANGE vest -- not the blue one. I called the company that it was purchased from to let them know of the mistake (Baby Age) and they claimed the order was for the orange one. Meanwhile, I'm looking at the order information on Amazon.com and it shows that the blue one was purchased for us. Now I'm stuck with an orange vest that I can't return b/c the company will only credit the original credit card holder and not issue a gift certificate.The vest itself seems all right. I don't think it's any more than a vest with a lot of pockets, which could come in handy for anyone -- not just Dads.But if you want the vest in a color other than orange, beware that it's likely you're apparently going to get an orange one."
4,Good Idea as a gift,"Good product. Made well. Cool. Have not used the product myself, only given it away twice as gifts."
5,Brilliant!,I loved this. Such exquisite rhyming and fabulous descriptive verse. Love it! I am definitely now an E.A.P fan! I'd recommend this to any of my friends that I think are able to appreciate such pure talent.
5,Lovely!!!,"There is nothing outstanding about this book, but more the poem within it. Poe was a poetic genius. This book is good in the sense that nothing distracts you from the poem. It allows the reader to be captivated by the poems beauty instead of a pretty cover."
3,It'll do...,"I like the simplicity of the screws, but this thing couldn't take a hard hit without breaking; too brittle. It would make a decent replacement, but if you can get a metal one, I would suggest that. They're sometimes listed only a few bucks more, so why not?"
4,Wow...,I saw these guys in April with Michael Buble and have been crazy about them ever since! They are great. What talent and use of God-given gifts! I love the variety of beats and music styles... the solo lines are great and who thought you could play the electric guitar or bass with your mouth? :-) Great work fellas.
5,Amazingly fabulous,"Almost no words to describe their talent. We enjoyed them just as in their pre-act of Michael Bublé in Antwerp, Belgium just as much as MB himself (who whas very good as well, real entertainer).For almost 15 minutes I was in the belief they were using a CD, before I understood which amazing sounds they could make, all naturally.Truly amazing. I'm telling all my friends..."
3,denom CD / tape player,this unit has been used for assemblies. this unit has been trusty but its CD player can not fast foward into the song. it also skips ocasionly. its a OK unit and its good if you need two in one.
2,"Looks nice, but not trustworthy","I think this is the best-looking device, but I'm very disappointed with the quality control and accuracy.The first unit I purchased displayed a constant zero reading for indoor humidity. With the remote and base units litterally side-by-side, temperature readings were usually within 1 degree F. The atomic clock could not find a signal, but that's probably due to my location.I exchanged the unit (because of faulty indoor humidity sensor), and again set up the indoor and remote sensors side-by-side. Temperature readings were usually within 1F. However humidity readings were rarely within 5%, and sometimes as much as 25% different. I observed these differences for about one week, indoors in So Cal. As before, the atomic clock did not find a radio signal. I never set or tested the barometric pressure.I'm returning it and looking for an alternative."
1,Terrible product,I purchased one of these units with inside and out temperature/humidity. I could not get any of the readings to be within 4 degrees of each other even with the outside sensor inches away from the main unit. The same was true for the humidity. I emailed the company and they never replied. That says it all.
2,Very Confusing to Operate and Set-up. Works Well Most of the Time. Clock Can be Unreliable,"I've had this unit now for over a year or so. It works fairly well. The only thing that is bad about it is setting it up when installing new batteries, etc.. The controls are very confusing (both the buttons on the front and the three buttons in the back). The instruction manual is not very coherent and is written badly. Also, there is no convenient way to grip the unit when moving it or picking it up. The way the buttons are on the front and back, it is very easy to inadvertently press one of the buttons and screw everything up. I did have a problem off and on with the time not displaying correctly. It will be correct for several weeks then it will be wrong. When I manually reset the time, it will eventually be incorrect again. Not a reliable clock!"
4,The return,The Return isnt for everyone but i really enjoyed it when i saw it at the movies so did my mother. i love the coloring of the movie that makes it look like an older film. smg is great as joanna. and i love movies about reincarnation thats why i loved this movie....
4,Good movie,"This was a good movie. It is packed with suspense and intrigue. It is not really frightening, but it is still quite entertaining. The acting is very good."
1,Stinks!,"Boring, pretentious and completely lacking vision. That pretty much sums up the snoozefest that is ""The Return."" This movie doesn't know what it wants to be.The cinematography is weak with the colors being almost completely washed out at times. The rest of the images are bleak and dreary. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Peter O'Brien had NO chemistry whatsoever. I also had a very hard time believe Sarah Michelle Gellar to be this no-nonsense saleswoman.The writing and the pacing are weak. The producers knew this movie would bomb, hence the numerous release delays which ultimately was strategically planned to shamelessly ride on the coattails of ""The Grudge 2.""Did I also mention the poster artwork is a complete rip-off from that of ""The Skeleton Key?"" This movie is unimaginative and will soon be forgotten by cinemagoers."
1,Horrible,This is the only movie I have ever bought and could not watch! I would not recommend this to anyone. I let several friend borrow the movie and they all said they couldnt watch it either!!!
1,complete nonesense,"i cant beleive i paid ten bucks to see this in theaters. there was no story what so ever. no plot. there wasnt even a villian in the story, just Buffy running away from fear. oh wow, how scary. if you want to waste 90 minutes of your life, this film is the perfect way to do it."
2,Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!,"OMG, I am so sick of this $h1t !!!!The Sixth Sense is done!!! It's over!! And even THAT was a rip-off (though slightly better) of ""Jacob's Ladder!""This was just purely boring crud. I fell asleep just before the end. I had to watch the end again in the morning. Waste of time. Please Sarah... get a better manager!! Whoever it is now is just wasting your talents!Two stars for her alone."
4,A Small Town In Texas...,"THE RETURN is an average supernatural thriller made better by the presence of Sarah Michelle Gellar (THE GRUDGE, POSSESSION). She's wonderful in these types of roles, very understated and realistic. I wasn't a big BUFFY fan, but I've loved Ms. Gellar's movie roles ever since SCREAM. RETURN has her trying to figure out why a past event has come back to haunt her. With nightmares and creepy visions to guide her, Sarah must solve the mystery behind frightening ""memories"" of Lasalle, Texas, a town she's never been in! If you enjoy spookers like THE RING, SKELETON KEY, THE GIFT, etc., then this one belongs in your collection..."
2,confusing psychological thriller,"Although an excellent cast and mostly well done, most the male characters were either rude or crude. For example the father of Joanna was not warmly greeted by Joanna on her return and when he brought up the fact she was mutilating herself she accused him of not being aware she was calling for help as if he was supposed to had a degree in psychology while when everyone else asked her why she mutilated herself she claimed she didn't know. The ending falls apart. She swerves to miss the truck of the murderer and ends up in the creek, comes to and runs into the woods chased by the murderer. How she ended up in the Terry's truck after he kicked her out of his house is not explained and the murderer gets away."
2,Dull and unoriginal,"I wanted to like this. I like Gellar. But I did not enjoy watching endless, repeated tracking shots that added nothing to the story and slowed the pacing for no good reason. Also, the plot is nothing new. It's nothing you can't see on the TV show Medium every other week."
2,The Return DVD Review,"I watched this film for a while and got quite bored with it, so I turned it off. Perhaps one day I'll force myself to watch it again."
2,Shiznit - this film bites!,"Two word review: It Sucked!Watching this movie was similar to watching paint dry - only without getting high off the fumes.It's a tedious third-rate film with horrible acting, no plot and little meaningful dialoge. The actors annoyingly whisper their lines for much of the film. That annoyed me until I realized how boring the film was...then I just made up my own story.Unfortunately, the FEW attempts to scare are your basic low-budget ""lady in mirror"", ""guy walking around with knife while girl hides under bed"", and an occasional ""loud noise that jolts you (because it has no context in the scene)"".If you are looking for a good suspense film...continue looking. You will be sorely dissapointed and bored by this film. If your dumb enough to rent/buy it (like I)...you'll know why they titled it ""The Return""...I'd like to return it right now!"
4,A Thoughtful Horror Story,"Having seen this movie twice on HBO, I think I can make a fair assessment on it.This is not a typical horror movie. It is a drama with supernatural elements. And as such, it succeeds admirably.Think of it as going out on a dark night alone then hearing, in the distance, a long mournful wail. It frightens but at the same time, one detects great sadness in the sound.I'll leave it to others to describe the plot. I will add that Sarah Michelle Gellar delivers a powerful performance. It is miles far away from the perkiness of Buffy."
2,Not Well Thought Out,"In my opinion this was a poor attempt to recreate movies like the sixth sense and Stir of Echoes. The movie was very sloow with random incidents occuring throughout that were left unexplained in the end. Also, there were poor attempts to create action or scare the viewer where there was no action. They tried to bring the random events together in the end but it still left a huge question mark! Renting this movie was a waste of time."
2,why bother?,not a great movie! the only thing good about it is the hunky male star. the grudge this aint
2,Disapponted. Gellar can do better.,"This is NOT a horror movie. At best it's a thriller. In reality it's simply a vehicle for Sarah Michele Gellar. The movie is slow and convoluted. Except for a few moments of forced panic, Gellar walks through the movie with a clueless, zombie-like expression, reflecting the boredom I was experiencing. The ending has an interesting twist, but the build up, such as it was, was hardly worth the wait. As much as I like Gellar, this is a movie I would have gladly passed on."
3,GHOST STORY,"BUFFY's Sarah Michelle Gellar returns to her horror home in this strangely effective, if illogical, ghost story. There's little gore and the atmospheric cinematography and music help enhance the mood of this eerie little chiller.Gellar plays a sales rep who returns to her native Texas and discovers that there are some nasty skeletons in her closet that are haunting her. She reunites with her father (Sam Shepard)and fslls for a local hunk and soon discovers what's terrifying her.The disc offers an alternate ending that really isn't any more effective than the original, and a few deleted scenes.Not a classic ghost story but effective."
