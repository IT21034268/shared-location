3,"cheap solution, but kills sound cuality",lets interference into your system. I use it for digital signals and noticed it. Can't imagine it with analog signals.
3,Great return,I asked for a refund on this product and received it right away. Thanks for a great service!
5,Solid Reference and Well Constructed,"For both beginning and advanced speakers -- really, anyone seeking to persuade others -- this is a FINE reference. The work is loaded with URLs and reference sources for research purposes. You'll definitely want to keep this book on the shelf within handy reach. The chapter on ""Speaking to Persuade"" is especially useful for getting commitment from others. I recommend the work particularly to business professionals who want good, solid advice on how to construct and deliver effective communications. In addition, the author has provided exceptionally well-integrated support materials to ensure proper understanding of the concepts. Teachers and trainers will find the bank of test materials and workshop exercises extremely helpful. Also, the CD presents highlights from such outstanding speakers as Barbara Bush, John F. Kennedy, Elizabeth Dole and Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr."
2,IXLA Webeasy without the camera,"This is a very easy easy program to use if you don't plan to put any banners on your page or do any of your own html additions. It would be a wonderful tool for a child. They would need help to import the pictures, and to build and upload the file to the web. After everything is there its complete clicking to do a web page. If you plan to add any html at all to your page do not buy this, otherwise it is a very easy tool. Just too easy!"
2,Worse sound I have heard in a long time!,"Speaker itself is plastic as well as the enclosure. It actually sounds better without the enclosure. Bass is bad, high frequency is unnatural. Could work OK for background music in an office."
4,fun for the beach,"We bought this set for our children ages 7, 6, 5, and 2 for a vacation at the beach. They all enjoyed this set. They didn't have much use for the sifter, and the watering can was a bit small, so they had to keep going back to the water to refill it. Overall it stood up to daily use by these 4 children for a week - which was all we needed. It was nice that everything fit back into the carrying case as well."
5,great set of sand toys,"we ordered this sand set for our 18 month old. we took it on vacation with us and she is just learning to have fun at the beach. this is a great set with all of the basics, she especially enjoyed the watering can. great value!"
3,Price reflects the durability,"The set comes for a very reasonable price and is certainly well suited for playing with sand and water. As already described in another review, the top of the watering can comes off pretty quickly and cannot be fixed to the bottom part anymore. I've ordered a Spielstabil watering can now, which though costs nearly as much as this whole set..."
4,Nice sand toys,well i got these for our 2 and 6 year old and me for our trip to san diego and lasted 4 days at the beach just fine!! well until i started to digging a huge whole with the bucket and it broke. but its stong enough for the kids! and the bag helps keep it all together
4,Great beach set for great price!,My son is 19 motnhs and love this toy! Great for playing at the beach! Great colors! Very good price!
1,Very low quality,"My expectations were not very high for a cheap, plastic sand toy set but this product did not even meet them. 2 of the parts (the bucket and the watering can) broke in 2 days. I could foresee an older child (my son is 2) breaking the remainder of the pieces very easily.Don't waste your money on this."
3,not very durable,"First of all, my daughter loves these toys; we bought them for her sand box in our back yard. Unfortunately, the shovel broke in half (handle's plastic snapped at base of shovel) after less than 2 months of use. The handle just snapped off. (My daughter just turned two when this happened so I'm assuming she didn't do it!) The sifter has little notches on the side so you can set it on top of the bucket. My daughter loves to pour sand through the sifter and into the bucket to see what size pebbles stay on top. That is probably the most ""educational"" this toy gets (which is why I gave this 2 stars for the educational value--but this isn't an educational toy, so I don't think that's a bad thing). And my daughter LOVES the watering can. She uses it literally every day to water our hibiscus.Pros: fun colors, lots of different toys in one setCons: shovel broke soon after purchase"
3,arrived broken,some items were broken when we got them in mail. thin plastic but they werent expensive so i would say they are ok for the price.
1,Beach Set,Purchased this for my granddaughter - can't wait till the warm weather so we can take it down the beach.
2,"Beautiful pictures, short on factual details","I ordered this book as we are going to Norway next month. Although the photos were beautiful and the history very interesting, I found it short on factual information. I later picked up Frommer's guide which I found to be much more useful, particularly with regard to daytrips, tours, directions."
1,Not the best travel book for Norway,This book is hard to understand. Not easy to navigate. Good color pics -but that's it.
4,Dictionary great for English speakers.,"The Hippocrene Children's Illustrated Czech Dictionary is filled with great pictures of everyday items. A child or adult wishing to learn the language through naming items and learning verbs will find it easy to do with this dictionary. The pictures are cleverly illustrated, and the Czech word is given in the English and Czech languages accompanied by the English phonetic pronunciation of the Czech words. This is not a true dual dictionary, however. We wanted to give it as a gift to a Czech child to learn English. No phonetic pronunciation was given for the English words, and the English phonetic pronunciation for the Czech was confusing to the Czechs. It definitely is made for the English-speaking person trying to learn Czech; then it is delightful."
1,Bad experience with Sony Vaio PCGGRT170,"I purchased a Sony Vaio PCGGRT170 in January 2004. The LCD creashed in February 2005 (just out of warranty). I paid $777.60 to Sony for repairs on 3/09/05 and repairs took close to a month. Now in September 2005, the LCD is flickering and headed for a crash. Sony says that since repair guarantees are only 90 days, I need to pay them another $777.60 and wait another month for repairs."
1,Unbelievable poor quality poor support,I wish I had flushed so much money down the toilet. My laptop has so far experienced TWO severe problems sending the laptop to Vaio's support center. Useless to mention how much I spent struggling with the laptop trying to make it work. The laptop came back yesterday with new problems and they couldn't care less. My worst buy ever.I also have a Toshiba laptop that I purchased for $1500 LESS that the Vaio. Ironically I am more satisfied with the cheaper Toshiba.
1,"BURNING UP IN BACK, MELTING THE ADAPTER",ISN'T THAT THE LIMIT. I NEED TO HAVE A FAN RUNNING OUTSIDE OF THIS THING TO KEEP IT FROM MELTING AND OFF IT GOES AND ON IT GOES. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH AN HP PAVILLION. WHAT DOES IT? IT'S JUST NUTS
3,A little goes a long way,"Jack Smith's unique vocals work best with a small back-up band. He is at his best on ""Miss Annabelle Lee,"" which may be the definitive version of that hit song. Smith's ""whispered"" baritone hits the suitable near awe/leer over Annabelle's charms. When he is accompanied solely by piano or when is he camping it up, his style wears quickly. He retired in the '30's when he saw the handwriting on the wall - fewer paying customers, for one. There is enough here to please twenties fans and collectors but also some dead wood."
4,A good collection.,"Not their best, however. Their best is Rust In piece and Peac Sells, but this is a moderate collection of the Megadeth we grew up with and loved. I knew that Hanger 18 and Peace sells were going to be on the album, but no ""Take No Prisoners?"" However, the two new tracks really have begun my Megadeth crave. Megadeth has ginally gotten out of that ""fans-like-us-so-we'll-change-our-style-of-music"" trend that Metallica has fell in so deeply and, sadly, can't get out. Back to good ol' fashioned metal that reminds me of Countdown (I wonder why the song Countdown wasn't on the album) and Youthanmasia (though a few more from that album would be highly appricated) VIC RATTLEHEAD FOR PRESIDENT!"
4,Some of Megadeth's best,"I'll be honest, I'm not a hardcore Megadeth fan. I'm not even a hardcore 80s rock fan. BUT... this cd is GREAT! It's one of the few CDs I can listen to without skipping a single track. Watch out with this version of the cd, though. It's ONE CD for $49.99. It technically only has one track that isn't on the ""regular"" release of this cd, too (""Wake Up Dead."") I haven't heard ""Wake Up Dead,"" but I highly doubt it's worth the $40 extra dollars. ""Punishment"" is a mix of all the songs on the CD and is on the regular CD on track 14 after the regular song (""a hidden track""). 4 stars because of the price of this version."
5,One Coffee and a Danish to go!,"""One coffee and a Danish to go!""No, not that kind of Danish! I'm talking about Bente Elsworth's study course for learning Danish.It's a complete course for those who are interested in learning the Danish language. It is a very fun and interesting book. You'll be speaking and understanding Danish in no time with Elsworth's excellent book. Tapes for the course are available, as well. Don't limit yourself to ordering a Danish in Danish - get the course that will have you on the road to fluency. Check out Bente Elsworth's ""Danish: A Complete Course For Beginners"", and you'll be glad you did."
3,tangos,This is a wonderful cd for people who love tangos...Libertad Lamarque had her own unique style and she expressed her music in a manner full of emotion and from the heart!
1,don't buy,"it holds the bubble solution in it's mouth (makes pouring difficult, the solution drips and the monkey blows the bubbles on the floor."
1,Not Worth It,"This monkey is a piece of junk. It's difficult to fill, and only holds enough bubbles for about 2 minutes, given the dripping and few bubbles that it does blow. Don't waste your money!"
5,Colorado Byways Off-Road Adventures,"The book was advertised as Used because it had a slight bend on the back cover, but it actually looks like a brand new book. We are very pleased with it, and we are already planning some off-road travels using it as our guide."
3,Good for SUV travel not true 4x4,"This book is geared to SUV travel and not 4X4 travel. If we found the route in this book, we figured it was too easy for our modified Tacoma 4x4."
5,"Vanessa Amorosi's ""Heroes Live Forever"" a standout track","This CD is particularly notable for Vanessa Amorosi's magnificent performance of ""Heroes Live Forever."" Amorosi's powerful vocals are set against the backdrop of anthemic brass and chorus that together make for a breathtaking experience. After listening to this track, you will be left breathless, speechless, and wanting more."
5,Absolutely Everything Anyone Can Hope For,"I bought this CD mainly because of Vanessa Amorosi. I loved her song ""Heroes Live Forever"" and couldn't get it online. I went onto Amazon and paid alot of money to have this CD import and it was worth it. I got to listen to all the songs on the special day - Nikki Webster, Tina Arena, the Austrailian Children Choir, etc. The CD is definitely a must have."
5,Savage Young Beatles,"The album is a great retro look at the begining of the best band ever to record music. The raw, yet clean sound of these songs are excellent.This album is a must for any Beatle fan."
3,E-Stamp has gone under!,"I own E-Stamp and was fairly satisfied with its performance. Alas, I've just received news from the company that it is discontinuing the product and will effectively be out of business by March 2001. :-("
3,Not user freindly.,"I would wait to purchase this product. It is not very user friendly yet. There are still so many little glitches that it seems more trouble than its worth. For instance, I type in the address I want to send to and than when I print the wrong zip code comes up. After you print one address you have to restart the program to print another address otherwise the program prints the previous address and charges you. So bottom line, its a nice idea but I would wait for the second version to come out or maybe the third."
4,"Good read, but felt kinda shortsighted","Well another great addition to the Gaunt's Ghost series, but overall not really the best. First of all I'll talk about the good, it kinda goes into the background of the Imperial Guard a bit, detailing about ""followers of the strength"" good info. There are good action pieces throughout the book as they return to Gereon. The bad is well they return to Gereon, then towards the end of the book it feels as if it was rushed or just didn't have much thought put into it. It wasn't the return that was expected I guess. A good extension of the storyline overall though."
3,An excellent book - but only half of it.,"First, let me begin by saying that Abnett is the best writer out there for the GW / Black Library books.As usual, his work on the Ghosts is crisp and exciting -- really accessible without being simple.This book is just too short -- too much happens in too short a number of pages to really support the dual plot lines. In effect, the Ghosts themselves are sacrificed for the Dalin Crid plot line -- which, while interesting, has been done in better style by Abnett with his Brin Milo story arc.Not sure what happened, but the work either needed a sequel or another 300 pages. As it is, it feels clipped and half finished."
5,Another great book from Dan Abnett,"Once again Mr. Abnett has given a great book with his equally great character, Gaunt. The book begins almost right off the bat with the ending of his last book, ""His Last Comand"", and throws the reader into the middle of the liberation for Gereon. It begins the gaurd training of Dalin Criid and the formation of the movement by the crusade to take back worlds that were lost to Chaos. I will only point out that Mr. Abnett is a superior author because, in his own words, he is an ""equal fatalist."" Thanks Dan, another great book."
3,Book 10,"When Commissar Ibram Gaunt left the planet Gereon, he promised he'd return with help to liberate the Chaos-held world. He expected the son of team member (Criid) to graduate RIP, become a Ghost, and go with them. Instead, Dalin Criid finished RIP (academy) only to be activated and thrown into war as a grunt soldier.They all end up on Gereon, but in totally different sections. Dalin must fend for himself. Dalin must not only survive the hostile world and the Emperor's enemies, but also his own superior who seems to be very trigger happy (with rifle, gun, and whip) toward his own men!*** NOT the best installment of the Gaunt's Ghost series. The battle scenes are realistically done and extremely intense. However, once RIP is over, there seemed to be more mundane ""filler"" pages than anything else. This is still a good read, but wait for the paperback version. ***Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
4,Dan Abnett never fails to satisfy,"This latest installment in the Gaunt's Ghost series is just as good as I've come to expect from Dan Abnett. If you are like me and you have followed the development of each of the signature characters, you will not be disappointed. I look forward to the next installment with just as much anticipation as I did this one. The only regret I have is that I finished too quickly!"
5,Showcase,"As the other reviewer noted the recording is not ultra-professional, though soundboard and clean. It's vocal heavy but the vocals really shine, and are a big part of what they were about. The rest is there, though the balance is a little off (it seems to be the straight house mix rather than a separate remix for the recording - if this was then intended to be released a good engineer would have ran an independent mix that could later be remixed, but I'm sure a multi-track recording was beyond their means, as back then that was some heavy duty equipment).Nevertheless I actually like this one a bit better than some of their studio stuff. I tend to favor live recordings anyway as a true measure of what a group is about. They tend to capture a little more inspiration (if it's there) or point out what's lacking (if it's not). There's a little bit of showiness in the stage patter, but the vocal harmonies are truly sweet."
5,great film.,"""Marie Antoinette,"" is a wonderful film and true story. A very sad one, and one really feels deeply for Marie Antoinetteand her family. Tyrone Power and Norma Shearer are wonderful in it. It's very romantic and mving. The crulity of the, suffering and exection her family is very sad, yet moving, making one beeve they will be reunited in heaven."
5,Great classic,"Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power are so wonderful in this. It's one of the most moving films. Sad, yet romantic and hopeful. It's a must see classic and well worth many starts The acting is brilliant."
5,Vastly Superior To Coppola's Nightmare Acid Trip ......,"This is one of the finest French period pieces ever made. Visually, it's hypnotic and surpasses the highest expectations. Adrian's costumes are spectacular and the sets, script and casting are all superlative, with the exception of Tyrone Powers, who is attractive but somewhat wooden. Sophia Coppola's new version of ""Marie"" is a joke compared to this masterpiece. Only ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is in the same league as this hidden treasure."
5,Norma Shearer - Perfect,"I first saw this film on T.V a long time ago in the wee hours of the morning...... What really impressed me was Norma Shearer. I knew who she was and heard she was a great actress but not until I saw this film did I believe it! One of the finale scenes in the movie I've never forgotten, when Marie Antoinette played by Norma Shearer has to say good-bye to her son. It is devastating; the vast array of emotions she portrays ,the depth of sorrow soo real it had me crying yet it wasn't a manipulative performance. It was genuine and heartfelt. She was a revelation to me as an actress,definetly worthy of respect as one of the great actress' of her time,and this film is worth seeing. *****"
2,HENRY HILL LIKES TO TELL STORIES,"This book contains some interesting stuff but most of it is recycled from wiseguy and the wiseguy cookbook. In addition to being extremely fluffy some of the stuff he says is flat out wrong. He says that Vito Genovese somehow posthumously blew the door off of Frank Costellos crypt. Genovese died in 1969 and Costello died in 1973. Most crackheads can see the problem with this little tidbit. Save your money and read it at the store, it should only take about 15 minutes. By the way, I made the oven penitentiary sauce from his cookbook and it sucked."
5,Marvelous Book!,I would say that this book is made for every single Business Manager even the ondes who are not at all interested on this area. A Basis and basic Book for driving information.
5,KrunK- GREATIST HITS RULES!!!...,"A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY CD COLLECTION!!!!!!! WITH THE VOCALS OF THE SCORPIONS DRUMMER, JAMES KOTTAK, AND THE DRUMMING FROM TOMMY LEE'S SISTER, ATHENA, THIS CD KICK SOME SERIOUS BUTT!Krunk IS WHERE CHEAP TRICK MEETS GREEN DAY ON A BAD DAY. THE GRUNGY SOUND OF THE GUITARS, THE RASPY VOCALS, THE POUNDING OF THE DRUMS, CAN'T ASK FOR MUCH MORE FROM THIS BAND. ""I BELIEVE"" IS A CLASSIC SONG THAT IS A FAVORITE OF MINE. ""BENT"" IS JUST A KICKING SONG WITHIN ITSELF.DON'T WAIT ANY LONGER, GO GET THIS CD NOW!!!!!!!!"
4,Krunk in the hizzz-ouse,"This record is pretty catchy. You've got James Kottak (ex-Kingdom Come, ex-Warrant, current Scorpions drummer) playing just about everything and handling the vocals as well. Just about every song on here is pretty good. If I have one criticism, it'd be that they all start to sound the same after a while. That aside, this is a superb CD from a band that probably got zippo in promotion or airplay, which is a shame, since just about any tune on here is as good or better than anything I've heard from Sum41 or Blink-182."
3,CHEEKAH BOW BOW (that computer song),"Hey hello, im from Holland (just like the Vengaboys)and like to tell u something 'bout --}CHEEKAH BOW BOW (that computer song)the for last single of The Vengaboys released here in Holland (last 1 was ""FOREVER AS ONE"")is pretty ok, it's an almost whole Vengastyle Number, but not quit yet. So, if you already own THE PLATINUM ALBUM and liked the album version of CHEEKAH BOW BOW, but missed the Vengastyle on it, you should go and purchase the single version. There are some great remixes on the single too and of course their videoclip. The single didn't go so well here in Holland, but if you're a great Vengafan just like me...you should go and buy it anyway. If you're curious..The Vengaboys are currently working on their 4th album and let's hope they'll go back to the style they started with. JESUS....me and their style..lol :) Talk to ya later!!"
2,Doesn't work well for the older baby,"This probably would work well with a brand new baby; if you played this CD during their bedtime routine from the first day you brought them home from the hospital. But if you were the desperate, bleary-eyed, sleep-deprived mother of a 4 month old who was waking every hour (yes every hour), like me, then this CD is probably not going to help you. By 4 months, my daughter already had settled into bad sleep habits, namely the habit entitled: ""I am incapable of putting myself to sleep because I've been held 24/7 the first 4 months of my life."" We followed the instructions to a ""T"" for several nights and it did nothing. If anything, the music only kept her awake. So if you're searching for a method to teach your baby to sleep, and your baby isn't a newborn, I suggest you keep looking. But if it's intended for a brand new baby, I'm sure you'll have more success than we did."
5,fel pro gasket set,It was a very good price and good quality on the gasket set. It was the best price I could find on-line
3,not quite what I expected,"I purchased this set of mixing bowls to replace my old pyrex bowls I inherited from my mom. You know, the set of yellow, green, red and blue bowls. The bowls just came today - delivery was a bit on the slow side but I guess we can't have everything in 2 days. Anyway, the new french white bowls are EXTREMELY HEAVY!! Much heavier than the old pyrex bowls that I loved so much. I hope I'll get used to them but I'm not thrilled with these bowls."
3,TRIPPING OVER A LIVE GRENADE,"Having bought Wings over AMERICA LP back in 1976 I couldnt wait to see a wings concert. I was only in grade school at the time and was too young to go. IN 1989 I had the chance to see paul. MY expectations fell short. I feel Paul was selling out by playing mostly BEATLES material. Paul has got way too much good stuff of his own.Compared to wings over america this is just plain boring. If you have achoice of this or wings over america, go for the latter IT ROCKS and there is never a dull moment,and also shows pauls got more talent than JOHN, GEORGE,and RINGO put together."
2,OK -- Certainly NOT 5 stars,"This disk is not nearly as good as Wings Over America. It has its moments, though."
5,"Oh baby, this thing rocks!","This album is so cool, that even people who officially hate Paul McCartney say that this album is pretty cool. Certainly, this album is not as fantastic as ""Wings Over America"" - which is by far the holy grail of recorded music as we know it - but never the less, this album has a great big variety of some of Paul McCartney's best songs! Believe me, I have over half of Paul's albums, and this is one of the best! Oooooooohhhhhhh yyyye-eahhhhhhhhhh"
3,Good choice of Beatles songs,"This is a good CD because it has many live Beatles songs that the Beatles never played live in concert, such as ""Hey Jude,"" ""Let It Be,"" ""Eleanor Rigby,"" and the second Abbey Road medley. The Beatles had long since quit touring when they recorded these (except for ""Eleanor Rigby,"" which was recorded BEFORE their 1966 world tour). The four post-Beatles songs are better than I had expected. The music is what really drives ""My Brave Face,"" more than the words.In short, buy this if you wish the Beatles hadn't quit touring after 1966."
3,Paul doing a lot of Beatles' tunes,"A tough call, this one. On one hand, it's nice to hear Paul playing some good rock'n'roll again- live on stage. On the other hand, it's too bad he had to rely on sooo much Beatles' stuff due to the weakness of so much of his '80s stuff. The band is pretty tight, but Paul isn't in the best voice of his career by far. Play some of these tracks back to back with Wings Over America and you'll see what I mean. Personally, I'd rather go back and listen to Beatles' albums than Paul and his band trying to reproduce the songs note for note. ""Things We Said Today"" is nice because it doesn't sound like he's trying to copy the sound of the original."
3,"Few great, most average","One of the best vocalists and music wtiters of all time is not showcased well on this live compilation. ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" version is one of the best-"
4,Good Gameplay,"This game worked perfectly on my computer; once installed, I ended up really enjoying it. There are many new twists on mahjongg with interesting tile configurations. The only not so great thing about this disk is that there is only one continous song that plays over and over again. If this game had come with some different soundtrack it would have definetly recieved 5 stars from me :)"
1,How Awful ! ! !,"It looks compatable with just about anything, until you get it home and try it! You better have an 'Accelerated 3D card' and no other programs on your computer or your going to end up fighting this one from the start! If you can get it to load, be prepared to have plenty of problems with your other programs! Go with something that people are rating as 'good' instead of relying on the advice of store personnel who may not even know what mah-jong is! Just because it has more stuff at a bargain price, doesn't make it a bargain! It's a disaster!"
3,poor customer experience,"Mistakenly ordered the wrong size(L instead of XL).Opened the package to find out that it was the wrong size, tried to exchange it, but company said because I opened the package, even though it was never worn, I could not exchange it. Very poor customer service."
5,Nice Shirt,Great shirt. Came exactly like I expected it to. Everyone is now asking me what Zildjian is. Size fits perfectly as well. Could not be more pleased.
5,Zildjian Classic Black,"You can have all the OD green, sleeveless, ""wife beaters"" you want, but nothing says classic more than this T.One of Zildjian's most identifiable items (other than their cymbals of course), one is readily identified as a drummer/percussionist with this on.I have had countless conversations started with this T, & I can tell you, it even helped me get a gig once. So what else can I say...it's a timeless article."
2,Horrible!,"BEGINNING bass? You have got to be kidding. The DVD starts off simple enough with basic into to various bass parts, tuning and then some simple one string at a time plucking. After the first couple of minutes, the guy has you playing blues riffs and explaining how a G can sometimes be an A, but a F is always an F, but sometimes a B can be a C and a D can be a G sharp other times, blah blah blah...whatever!I mean come on...to be a BEGINNING instructional format this moves way too fast too soon. I should have listened to my inner voice when it arrived and resisted opening it to exchange it for something else but I didn't.Looks like it will be garage sale fodder."
4,Like the others....,"This series is great. Good coverage on the basics, really gets you started on what you need to know to begin playing."
2,less than desirable,"was very disappointed in the style of the presenter, and teaching methods. Went very fast through each song, and expected you to keep up. I realize you can stop the dvd, but was still very fast. I will probably not buy another dvd with this person as the instructor."
3,Uninspired,"This record by Warrant with Jamie St. James is quite uninspired. IMO Warrant should have called it quits when Jani Lane passed away. Maybe if they would have found a better lead vocalist with stronger pipes, it would have made a difference. However, they did not and they produced a substandard record that sounds like a wannabe metal band that hasn't been around for 10(+) years."
4,Sounds like the mid-80s all over again!,"If I didn't know better, I would believe that this was recorded around 1985 and that's alright by me. Good ole straight ahead hard rock and roll like we used to crank back in the day! Actually, with Jaime St. James vocals, it's not to far removed from a Black 'N Blue album. If you're in the market for some good old school 80s rock, with no hint of modern day music, you can't go wrong with this."
2,Not their best!,"First of all, I like Warrant and Black n blue but this cdhas too many songs that are sweet during the verse and fallapart during the chorus.There are a few good tunes but overrallthe songs are lacking.I really wanted to love this cd butI would rather hear a new Black n blue release.I wonder whatJani will come up with on his cd.Just can't get into this cd that much."
3,"Not Jani Lane, but not bad","""Born Again"" is basically a solid rocking album. The tunes have some good melodies and grooves. They lyrics are pretty lame. It's all original members, except the main one, Jani, but new singer, Jamie St. James, doesn't sound too shabby. His voice fits the 80's style.This disc sounds like it would have come out between D.R.F.S.R. and Cherry Pie. It's pretty much a party disc for you to blast in your car. However, there are two songs that could've easily been dumped: ""Love Strikes Like Lightning"" and ""Glitter."" Love sounds very similar to American Woman and Glitter is a very bland and pathetic attempt at a ballad. It so lacks any feel that Jani was able to put into his ballads with Warrant, except ""I Saw Red."" That was kind of a lame ballad as well, but a lot better than ""Glitter.""So, if you want something to blast and just feel carefree too, then this record will probably meet your needs."
4,kick [...]rock,"Their new album is great and St.James(Black N'Blue) adds to the band!There are two many boy wonder bands and MTV flash n' the pan bands cluttering the airwaves with [...]! Warrant has been around for years and will be long after these one hit wonder bands leave! This album is great to crank up on the stereo and if you liked Warrant in the early days, you won't be disappointed! Their new album is by far their best and St.James is great with the vox! Rock music is dying and bands like Warrant bring back the spark to keep rock music alive!"
3,"Strong 3 stars, new singer is ok","Well I wanted to listen to this cd many times before reviewing. First few times I heard it, I hated it! After tons of listening it is a very catchy album if you give it a chance and turn off your brain as you listen.The first 3 tracks are solid! Devil's Juice and Dirty Jack especially! Solid rockers!The rest of the cd... hmmm well musically it's awesome but the lyrics(We miss you Jani) and the vocals are questionable.Love Strikes Like Lightning is the worst song I have ever heard haha. The lyrics... Let me get my story straight, she's the best thing since my last date, oh yeah!... horrible!!!Anyway Warrant won't make many new fans with this cd but will likely please some of the old. Some... I miss Jani and the 90s sound of Warrant! Fortunetly, Jani Lane's Back Down to One is a killer solo cd and sounds like like Belly to Belly Vol 1... woohoo!"
2,"Validating, but not helpful...","My father committed suicide in Jan. 2008 so I was in search of answers, all this book did was add to my ""head"" with reading other adult childrens experences. The book did however, validate most of what I'm feeling in my heart and my mind. It also showed how differently everyone grieves. Made me sad that some marriages end when a parent committs suicide, because I need my husband more then I have ever needed him in the ten years we've been together. Not a helpful book to read if you have just gone through the suicide of a parent - good book if you are a psychology major in college though to give good insight with regards to adult children dealing with a parents suicide. I don't reccommend this to anyone in my shoes though - it will just mess with your head even more...maybe in a few years read it, but not 7 weeks later, and actually I read it less then a month after losing my otherwise perfectly healthy 62 year old father."
3,Dial is hard for little hands to turn.,I bought this for my 20 month old son because he is obsessed with real toasters. It is very nice but he is just too little to be able to play with it yet. The dial is extremely difficult to turn (I even think it's difficult). The toast doesn't even really pop up that high when it's done. My son is definetely too little to work this toy. Would probably be perfect for an older child.
2,Tough for small kids,"I'll echo what a lof others are saying:Pros: It's somewhat durable and comes with fairly nice looking toast.Cons: It's really hard to turn the timer - making it nearly impossible for a small child to use this independently.Given the price, though, it's been a good buy overall."
2,Disappoint product,"Pros: Good-Like real looking. Light weight, suitable for kids.Cons: Timer died on the second day. The timer knob was too difficult for 3-4 yrs old kid to set/turn. It does not provide a good grip to turn. I end-up set this timer for my kid every single time he want to play. Not recommend to anyone."
2,Fell Short,"This toaster fell short because the toast does not drop all the way into the slots. When the lever is pushed down, the toast moves down into the slot, but there is at least 1"" still sticking out. It doeshave a timer that works, which is cute, and it does 'pop up', which is authentic, but if you have very observant children, they want the ""bread to disappear"" when toasting. It's colorful and well intended, but would not purchase again."
2,Not very good,"The music production on this album is rather poor and the songs are very generic and really sound outdated. Get the far better album ""Doubt"" instead and only get this album if you MUST have another Jesus Jones album. Otherwise, you're safe to skip this one."
5,yeaah!,"The only song i've heard yet of the Candy Snatchers is Ass, Grass, or Crack, and I already love them. 5 stars. Enough said."
3,Australian Cattle Dog,"I found this book to be informative about the breed but wish it had more ""how to"" with regards to stopping undesirable behaviors."
5,Great Book,book is great .. everything is straight forward .. good ideas and reccomendations .. easy to read ..
2,Not what I was looking for!,"This book is very detailed in the process of breeding and not enough as to Care, Nutrition, Behavior and Training as the Title of the book leads you to believe. It does state what your ACD needs as far as ""needs a job to do"" or ""daily exercise"" but does not give enough suggestions or examples for the reader to follow or try out. For me, this book is too generic. It says ""Exercise needed"" but no suggestions are given, ""Nutrition"" but no amounts or recommendations, and so on. The rest of the book is dedicated to the purchase and breeding. I think this book might be informative for someone thinking about buying a ACD but for someone that allready ownes a ACD this book offers very little information. But hey, the pictures are great."
4,Pretty good,"I have an Australian Cattle Dog myself, and this is the book that I had from the very beginning. It was pretty good, though it didn't give much info on how to deal with the Cattle Dogs large amount of energy. If you want a book on the background of the Australian Cattle dog, this is a good book, but don't get it if you are looking to solve problems."
1,Lacking information,I own over 100 head of cattle and pursched me a youg Blue Heller to train and thought this book was what I needed. No where in the book was there any help on how to train for livestock handling.
2,This is not the book it claims to be,"This book claims to be a training manual for cattle dogs. It turns out to be a basic training manual for ANY dog owner. Nothing specific about training for herding, hand signals, etc. I plan to donate it to the public library for new dog owners; it doesn't cut it for cattle ranchers!"
1,disaster pick,"very frustrated with this selection. at first chose a different one- piece as a gift for my wife, and through in a shirt to complete the order. received the shirt, called after weeks about the ""to be shipped "" item, learned they didn't have it. ordered this bathing suit and was mailed a completely different one instead. called, again mailed the wrong suit. quality contol? someone should read the tags. this item presumably mislabelled."
3,starting out hard,"When I first heard this cd it was just comeing out in 91 and I tryed it becuse of the rappers he was with (mcRen nwa) it was pretty cool and hard core gaster rap! I liked it but it wasnt very popular with alot of people and cpo didnt do too much after that, too bad becuse It could have really taken off in that time of ganster rap."
5,Classic Hardcore w/ Wit,A classic hardcore album with plenty of wit to boot (pun intended). Crucial Youth does a great job of poking fun at the straight-edge world of hardcore.
5,Best of the Best,Keith Sweat was an Icon in the 80's with his smooth style and distinctive voice. This CD is a reflection of all that he has accomplished in his career. A definte must for any Keith Sweat Fan.....
5,Make Me Sweat,"I'm surprised how many good songs are on this cd. I like every song on here except Merry Go Round. I also wish they would have included the 12 inch version of ""Something Just Ain't Right. It's a better version of that song. M' faves include I Want Her, Twisted, Nobody, My Body, I'll Give All My Love 2 U, Something Just Ain't Right, Don't Stop Ur Love"", bascically all of it. Keith Sweat has one of the most unique voices in R and B history and this album showcases all of his talent."
4,"All I can say is ""aaahhhh""","the perfect Friday or Saturday, sitting compfy, sipping something good, and listen! Seriously good old-school"
4,Good selection,"I had never bought a Keith Sweat album before, but I realized that I had enjoyed some of his songs from back in the day, especially ""I Want Her"". I picked this up when I saw it in a store because I figured a ""Best of"" album was a good way to get all of his good songs that I remembered. In addition to ""I Want Her"", I remembered ""Don't Stop Your Love"", ""Twisted"", the collaboration with Snoop Dogg, ""There You Go Telling Me No Again"", the LSG song ""My Body"" and ""Nobody"". I found that I liked a lot of the eighties and nineties slow jams that I hadn't heard before too. This is a good collection of an R&B star who should not soon be forgotten."
1,horrible,never received my music paid and it never downloaded. i feel i was taken advantage of. i had my phone checked and it was working fine
5,Forever Pleasurable!,"This CD is for the pleasure of whomever may have the good fortune to pick it and listen and when they do, it'll be pleasure forever. This peice will swing you to the outermost parts of smooth jazz. Take note of the cut that he sings on. His silky voice can be compared to the silky sax sounds that he produces throughout this sensual compilation of jazz excellence. Five stars just isn't enough for this one. Walter proves why he's the professor on this CD. Take a listen and enjoy ""For Your Pleasure"" forever!"
5,Do you want to dance,"This is a wonderful piece of music, it relaxes you, and squeezes you like a great big hug!!!! I just love it"
1,Dealing with webtwo,"I think Walter Beasley is wonderful... but when I ordered this CD, I was sent a tape cassette, who has tape cassette's.. When I contacted K.Beasley I was told this was a final sale.She wasn't a Wal Mart Store..I live in NY, work and manage a restaurant, and our main goal, is to make the customer or guest happy.. I returned the tape to Fla. and again was told by K. Beasley no refund, my credit card company fully refunded my money.. so I don't know how good or bad the cd was ... But I will never buy anything from a 3rd party again , on Amazon...and I really didn't even know it was from a 3r party until I placed the order.. Amazon was not much help at all.. So beware of things sold on Amazon, as they didn't help me much when it came to K.Beasley"
3,not for those who have lost 80 lbs and left with an apron!,"For some reason, the beige panties only have a very thin elastic waist instead of the wide, comfortable strip on the white hi-cut panties. I gave them to a friend because they constantly slipped over top of the fat apron, which was most uncomfortable. Don't understand why the difference in elastic when otherwise they are the same panty."
5,great,"Comfortable, don't bind, stretch without bagging, and look good under a (normal, not skin-) tight pair of pants."
5,FINALLY WHAT U NEED AND CAN AFFORD TOGETHER!,"Excellent for several different purposes. I use this desk for live presentations and to record at my studio. The sound is clear an strong, and the effects that come with it are pretty good and veeeery useful specially in live situations. Its an extremely versatile desk, and for it's price i would say you cannot find a better one available."
2,If,"Very poorly boxed for shipping. Besides a crack in the cabinet, the hardware was loose in the box. The same type cabinet is available at the big box stores, without the hassle of returning it. The beveled glass was ok, the rest was cheaply made."
1,Junk; it broke just like the last one with a quick release!,"Contrary to what I wrote originally, this thing broke; just like the last one did / with a quick release.Its a shame we can't get a RECORD vice anymore. The rest are Junk unless you can live without the quick release....... then you need to pay for a Jorgensen or something similar for at least twice the money as this one. The thing to remember it if breaks (and that one will!) you go through HUGE effort just to get it back OFF of your bench. Save your money and never stop looking for a RECORD vice / which looks identical to this one. . . ."
1,It Was Definitely Out Of Reach,"I was super excited to see Lord Steven's newest offering, 'Out Of Reach', especially when I saw that he had yet again teamed with a director from Hong Kong. After last year's fabulous 'Belly Of The Beast'(directed by Ching Siu Tung), I figured there was no way I could be disappointed. I was wrong. Lord Steven is just looking sick in this movie. He's bloated and his hair is extra nappy. The action is pretty weak and the script pathetic. But the worst part is that at least fifty percent of Lord Steven's dialogue has been dubbed over by someone(I'm pretty sure its the main bad guy in the film)else's voice, who sounds nothing like Seagal. Its pathetic. The entire film is pure doo doo. Very disappointing."
1,"the ""Worst"" Steven Seagle film I've ever commented","What happened to Seagle? I've never seen him in such a bad-prepared and incredibly terrible film before. What is the meaning of bringing Polish and Turkish community opposite of each other? It is definitely nonsense. Why slander a country?Seagle should not have taken place in such a meaningless product like this. There should be some other ways of arising problem of child abuse. I think it is a film which will be remembered not with the action and Seagle's reputation, but it will come to our minds by its enemy creating nature. I really encourage people ""NOT to watch"" it!!!"
1,PURE GARBAGE,"Gee another Steven Segal BOMB, wonder what this guy is thinking about??? The story takes place in Poland and a little girl whom Seagal has befriended via penpal has been kidnapped for prostitution purposes.Seagal arrives in Warsaw and single handedly fights the Turkish mob which is behind the above mentioned prostitution ring.The finale is laughable as Stevie being fat and old as he is, proceeds to kill the bad guy witha sword!!!!Steven it is time 2 retire my boy."
4,A good instructive about the Cathaginian Wars.,"When I puirchased this Item, I hope that book clear my ideas about the most caracteristical element in the punic army: The Elephants. In this book the autor wrote about this magnificents warbeasts but he not includes drawings or images about the original concept of the carthaginian war elephant. Nevertheless, the autor, in the description of the carthaginian army elements, clarify the formations, armor and weapons used by the africans, included the elephants tactics and the concept of the carthaginian war elephant.This book also deal with the republican roman army and the formation of the ""republican legion"", included the percentage of auxiliary troop and the evolution during the war."
4,Review of Armies of the Carthaginian Wars 265-146 BC,"I found this book to be an informative and a highly readable study of the armies of the Carthaginian Wars. It provided useful information on the organisation, weapons, tactics and uniforms of both the Roman and Carthaginian armies. The colour plates, maps, photographs and illustrations were excellent and supplemented the main body of text very well. I would have no hesitation in recommending this book to anyone who is interested in this period of Ancient History. The more serious student of the Carthaginian Wars would probably want to do further study beyond this book, but overall I would say this book is excellent."
4,Was a gift,"I gave to new grandson, Frederick. Leo Lionni is a must on every child's book shelf. The art and stories last forever."
3,Dash Mat,"It's good for the price.I had to velcro it down in alot of areas.Doesn't fit as well as I thought but it'll keep the sun off the dash and that's good enough for me,for now."
1,Not worth your money,"I bought this book to help identify vintage slide rules and I was sorely disappointed. There are no pictures. There is little information what the rules look like, what they're made of, and when they were made. I recently picked up 30 rules from various manufacturers and many of them were not listed in the book. The book only provides date ranges rules were made, no specifics on determining the exact age. For a particular manufacturer, like Sun Hemmi, the book does NOT provide the simple method of determining rules made from 1950 on (the 2 letter code)."
2,"too long list of makers, too short slide rule descriptions","The book is a long list of slide rule makers and models, from 1600 to today.There are short descriptions on slide rule technology at the begining of each section, but I expected a more detailed introduction and a shorter models and makers list."
5,TIme Saver,"What an excellent product. I recently built a new home and with all of the wall hangings etc., this tool has saved me a tremendous amount of time getting things placed. The push pins work great and allow me to use both hands to mount my shelving. I am looking forward to more projects as the Straight Line Laser Level makes the job easy!"
3,Ok,"For the price it's ok, but I bought this for professional use and it was kind of a pain.For light work and home use, it's ok, but for production work you need something better."
3,Fatal Flaw,"The pins that hold this unit to the wall are spring loaded. While the unit is anchored to the wall, the pin springs are working to retract the anchors. Eventually the unit falls to the floor. I have used this level in several types and grades of drywall and have had the same problem regardless. The reason for 3 stars is simply because the laser is easy to see and works well on the floor."
2,Does not measure up,"I can?t say that it measures up. The Strait-Line may be okay for hanging a picture or putting up curtains but it is not ready to replace the chalk-string yet. Sometimes it is okay. Other times it skips a lot and, in certain light conditions, it is very hard to see. It is handy as a quick check (Used for quick checks, I would give it four stars.) but I was unable to use for doing actual work, like putting up a tile ceiling on furring strips."
5,Best Thing Since Sliced Bread,"I picked up this laser line to help me when installing stairs in a house. Now my wife and I use it for everything from wallpaper hanging to hanging pictures. It is unbelievable how accurate this thing is. Once you've used it for a while, you will never know how you got by without it. Awesome product!!!"
1,Q: When is a Laser Level not a Laser Level?,A: when the instructions that come with the product say that it is not to be used as a level. This is not a laser level - it's a laser pointer with two push-pins.
3,Pricey?,"Don't know where the list price comes from, but it's over twice the price offered at the home improvement stores. (Never mind the shipping charges.) Maybe that's how the ""52% off"" gets generated. As always, buyer beware."
2,LASER LEVEL,"Bought this for a gift to my husband. He hasn't used it a lot, turns out to be a little more of a problem to use than not using it."
1,Great for working in the dark,"As other reviews have noted, my experience of this tool was that the light in the room had to be very, very low to see the laser line at all. Many times, I had to turn the lights off just to see the line. Also, keeping the thing on the wall with the pins was a joke. My attitude went from frustration to amazement as it fell off the wall again, and again, and again. Finally, you cannot accurately level the laser with the bubble levels on the tool, as the bubbles are too small to line up between the lines with ANY accuracy. This tool is being returned today and I am going to check out other products. I wish I had listened to others and not purchased it in the first place. Final result: a ""tool"" that has little use beyound amusing pets and maybe setting it on the floor to lay tile in the dark."
1,Laser Intensity,"The laser is not powerful enough,and the line washes out in the daylight. You have to work in the dark to use it."
3,Could be better,"This is a handy tool but can be much improved. The bubbles can't be easily leveled as they are smaller than the lines on the vial. This decreases the overall accuracy... Another minor nuisance is that the laser line starts about 1.5"" away from the unit; it would be nice if the line started at the base."
1,Save your money,I am still wating to see a straight line I can follow. The line will hit a perpendicular surface but not show up on the surface I am working on. I will be returning this item. Furthermore the 2 pins to hold it to surfaces are puny and they either do not penetrate or the unit falls.
2,Just the Facts!,"If you're like me you look at the reviews before buying. I was very excited when I saw this product. For me it meant no more lugging my big rotary laser. Well he's the deal. The Strait-Line 64001 Laser Level is a great idea, but it lacks greatly. The laser is just to dim to see. You can hardly see the line on a white wall. The laser's power is just not enough."
5,Best Christmas gift I have _ever_ purchased for anyone,"I can't believe how much my husband loves this laser level. I bought it for him as a Christmas gift. It was mostly unused for the first month or so, but then we moved to a new house. It took less than half as much time to put our pictures up in our new place. He's also used it for hanging hardware for curtain rods. A great timesaver that works really well.I think that there were comments in some reviews about the beam being too dim. I disagree with this, the beam has been bright enought for use in all locations in our house."
2,Not worth the money,"Well,right away upon practicing I found out as with many other reviews the level vials were not accurate.I used the push-pins[about 3/8"" long] in drywall and after a few screws secured into the drywall the level came down and cracked the laser lens cover which is the switch for the laser line.I would say however for the brief time it was used the laser beat a chalk line."
2,Don't waste your money like I did,"This tool is not very useful; I feel that I largely wasted my money. You have to manually level the tool (using a tiny bubble level) every time you want a level line, which means it is no more helpful than a traditional 48 inch framing level made of aluminum. But doesn't the laser at least work over longer distances? Not in practice, because you also need to manually hold it up on the wall while you use it (unless you want to pin it in place, leaving holes), so the line is only good as far as you can reach with your other hand. Real self-leveling, tripod-mounted laser levels are great, but this is not that tool."
1,"Bad product, lousy customer service","This thing is nothing but a laser line projector. The vial bubble doesn't reach the limit marks. How in the world would you be able to get a level with that? Use a little pin to held this thing on the wall? And to correct their bad design, they want you to buy those 3M Commander stickers. Yeah right! Don't bother sending them feedback on these errors, oh excuse me, features. They don't have the guts to respond. Stay away from strait-line."
5,Good Tool,"I used it to align tiles for a tile floor I was laying. Worked great. I had no trouble seeing the line. After reading the reviews, I checked the bubble level against a reference 4-foot level. It was dead on. No problems here. I recommend it."
4,Great Memories,"This is a wonderful collection of Music, I fYou Are a fane of pop and soul music of the sixties this is the collection for You"
1,over priced,I don't know way some sellers try to sell time life cds at high cost.Because most of the songs are common and can be found in many places.And in my case I copy the song list and make my own.
1,DOES NOT FIT THE 410!!,"This case doesn't even come close to fitting the Canon 410. The 410 has buttons placed in very different areas then the ones on the case. The 410 also has a lense that must extend to operate, and there is no room for this to occur in this case.Worse yet, I had no way to return it. The only option Amazon provided was to send an email to a third party vendor. My email went unanswered.I'm out over $100 and my little boy got a useless case for his birthday.A side note - it looks like an excellent product if you can find out what camera it does go with. The documentation that comes with the case does not list the cameras it fits either."
4,Amy's Organic Cream of Mushroom Soup,"Since learning to be conscious about reading labels lately, I have dropped using Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup. I find that Amy's Organic Cream of Mushroom Soup, diluted with either milk, water or sour cream does just as great a job. Even better since it's more healthy for you. I use it mainly over mashed potates (as a gravy) and steamed fresh veggies (as a sauce). It's even excellent as plain Cream of Mushroom soup!!"
5,Very Tastey!,The flavor is much better than Campbells or anything else we've tried from grocery store shelf. Read the ingredients and that will explain why it is more flavorful! More expensive but sometimes ya get what you pay for; so this is worth it.
1,NOT gluten free!,"The description says gluten free, but there is clearly wheat flour in the ingredients. Be careful!!!"
1,Don't bother,"There is little information here. I was looking for a sample of periodontal charting to give to my assistant, there was nothing like it present. Definitely not worth any $ for this info"
5,Alicia...In High Praise,THIS PRODUCT SOUNDS LIKE MUSIC FROM DIRECTLY FROM GOD HIMSELF THE SONGS JUST KEEP YOU DANCING ALL THE TIME.
5,So happy to see it back in print!,"Like the other reviewer, I was crazy about this book when I was a kid (so much so that I convinced my 6th grade English class to adapt it into a full-scale theatrical production). It's a fantastic story, and I'm so excited for my nephews and nieces to have the chance to enjoy it as much as their mothers and I did!"
3,B-Square mini 14 Scope Mount,"I received my order in a timely manner and it appeared to be a sturdy product. When I attmpted to install it, the threaded replacement cover plate was too wide and too thick to install. I was put in touch with customer service and had to leave a voice mail that was returned late the following day. The rep said this problem ""sometimes happens"" and he would send me a replacement part By the time the part arrived, I had filed and fitted the original part until it worked. The unit appears to be OK, though after about 20 rounds, I had to tighten scope ring mounting screws and the large knob, I plan to use a little Loc-Tite to fix this problem. All in all, the mount seems to be OK, but I think a little more quality control in China might be required."
2,Solid but DOESNT FIT!!!!!!!!!!,"Just picked my mini 14 tactical up fromt he dealer today, got home and was soooooo excited to get all of my attachments on it. The part that replaced the bolt stop cover plater, it twice as thick as the original plate and will NOT go in the slot. I am not a craftsman and do not have tools to fix this. I will call customer service tomorrow but for now they are gonna make me have to grind it down. I dont like this.I finally grinded it down with a dremel tool and got it to fit. Another problem is that the hex screw for tightening it down and leveling it to the stock, strip out very easily. I finally have it mounted and put thread lock on the screws and will shoot it this weekend. I dont have a lot of faith in the product thus far."
5,love these socks,i've been wearing these socks exclusively for years and don't get blisters like i used to. way better than the expensive cashmere socks i got at a clearance sale once. SURE WISH THEY'D BRING BACK LADIES' 9-11 DENIM... (sorry for shouting. hope they read that).
4,Old-timer gets 3.5*,"Brent and Brooks make a good team in this light silent film; older sister must rescue younger sister from a bad money deal, from a creepy dude down the hall in their apartment house, from...herself.W. C. Fields fans, take note of tenant Elise Cavanna, the triple-jointed patient of ""Dentist"", W.C., about seven years later. Here, she's Miss Gimple, looking beautiful but in a decidedly less provocative setting.Original musical soundtrack is excellent, although music is used for a costume party scene which sounds about 20 years ahead of the Roaring Twenties proceedings. place.One-reeler add-on: I can't make heads or tails of ""Railroad Stowaways"", from the same year.DVD video quality: passable."
4,Complementary readings to O'Connell's book,"There are already some good reviews, so I will only suggest reading the following books on war in addition to O'Connell's: a) ""War in human civilization"" by Azar Gat; b) ""War before Civilization. The Myth of the Peaceful Savage"", by Lawrence Keeley; c) ""How War Began"" by Keith F. Otterbein; d) ""War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires"" by Peter Turchin; and e) ""War and the Law of Nations: A General History"" by Stephen Neff."
3,A good analysis of how war evolved; but dated now.,"The philosophies of Hobbes and Rousseau consider the questions: Is war innate to humans or is war innate to civilization? Robert L. O'Connell answers ""no"" to both. Instead, O'Connell contends that humans were without war for most of their existence, and have only found it and maintained it because of its utility for the maintence of society. Once war no longer serves its purpose, then it is no longer necessary. At the time of this publication, O'Connell contended that this was coming true. This book explores how and why war arose, and argues that there is hope for its extinction."
1,novel ideas presented very poorly,This is another prime example of why academic books don't sell! The style is the most obtuse I've encountered and completely fails on clarity. Many of his suppositions are highly speculative and he makes far too many leaps of faith.
3,"Oh my God, I'm back AGAIN!","Having sampled the new single, I only want to say: Okay. It's not THAT bad. It sounds pretty decent. In a word, on a par with their earlier effort, I Want It That Way. There WILL be more on the radio from these guys. Especially the new ""Call single."" Oh, and we can't forget ""it's True."""
3,"Oh, my God, we're back again! But WHY?","Okay, okay, I DO like some of these guys' songs, but I'm no teen pop listener, so I can't say it's the best music there is. I saw the video for this song, and the boys don't look like the fine young stunts they were last year. A.J. is the only one I like out of all the boys now.Oh, well. I don't care if they DO try to challenge 'N Sync's record with Black & Blue. Just my two cents."
2,My boys (4yr old and 8 yr old) quickly lost interest in this game after just playing it a few times!,This game did not live up to my expectations. It was too one dimensional to keep the kids interested in playing.
1,"Lousy-gets stuck, yarn gets caught,nothing good about it-CHEESY!!","Beware before you buy this machine. Back in the day, they used to work great. Now, they are made very cheap and the yarn gets stuck, breaks and skips sections and leaves holes. Not good for adults or kids. Don't buy it!"
1,Return Before Opening,Please do not waste your money. The product did not function properly and would not knit. I have a broken hearted daughter and a return line in my future.
2,Singer knitting machine,It drops stitches and unravels. I was not able to knit successfully as an adult and I bought it for my granddaughter. I was very disappointed.
1,Would give it zero stars if I could,"Bought this for my 7 year old who wanted to make gifts for Christmas. Within 5 minutes the hand crank froze up and it quit working completely. We returned it and found out that this, unfortunately, is a very common problem. I'm very disappointed as it carries the Singer brand name and I expected a much better product. Great idea, horrible product."
1,"The tube function doesn't work, we are sending it back",The knitting machine is supposed to allow a tube knitting function and a straight row function. There is a button that slides back and forth that is supposed to allow this. It doesn't. This was a huge disappointment to a 9 year old girl that wanted a knitting machine for her birthday. We travelled from Olympia to Seattle to give it to our niece for her birthday and it only worked for one function. In addition the knitting rows looked sloppy. We are sending this back. We still have the packing receipt.
2,Disappointing,"We were very excited to get this machine and set to work using it right away. The first time, it worked smoothly with no issues and only a skipped stitch in the first couple of rounds, making a perfect tube several feet long. The next time we used it, the handle began skipping so that by the time we had a knitted tube a few inches long, the handle would no longer crank the machine, making a loud clunking sound every time it went around. Left with no way to actually make the knitting mechanism turn any longer.........it is sitting forlornly on a shelf. I have Singer sewing machines that have lasted decades, and an antique one that is still working 100 years after manufacturer. Dear Singer, you went wrong on this one!"
2,Who thought the yarn was a good idea?,"This machine is good idea, but in reality it is not that well made. The wheel stops turning constantly. Since Christmas my granddaughter has only been able to work on it for 15 minutes. The eyelash yarn is awful. It tangles in the skein and in the machine. It is also almost impossible to bind the tube off of the machine with that yarn. When I bought it I could not see the eyelash yarn in the box, or I would have known to buy another yarn to go with it. The other thing that should have been listed on the box, is that it takes a lace weight or at the most a sock weight yarn. I am waiting to get some different yarn before my final decision, but I am disappointed in it."
1,Broken within 5 minutes,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. We started the first project and were able to crank it 3 times before it broke. I am returning it today. We were both very disappointed.
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!,Didn't even make it through 1 scarf before breaking! Frustrating to buy this and have it not work like it is supposed to!
3,IT IS A TOY HOWEVER,First and foremost remember it is a children's toy it is not an inexpensive alternative to the higher grade loom. Once you realize this you can do some handy crafts with the device a little commonsense goes a long way if you hear slippage there is too much tension stop cranking and loosen the line. Second yarn 3 or below anything else will not perform right on the machine. Do not crank to fast or you may skip some stitches if you follow these simple rules you should have some fun with this toy.
1,Piece of junk,I am experienced knitter and has made hundreds of projects by hand. My 6 year old grandaughter asked me to teach her to knit and I thought this would be a good beginning project for her to make scarfs. It is horrible! I tried and tried and no matter what I did the beginning stitches unravel and as you go on stitches drop randomly. Then if you want to start over you have to cut the yarn and try and untangle the mess. I will just teach her on regular needles. This is worthless.
1,Chinsy,"I received this knitting machine, excited, I took it all out of the box, which by the way it needed a screw driver to let it out of the box. Read the instructions and loaded the machine to begin to work with it. I got a few rows done, or so I thought, only to find out it was unraveling as fast as I was sewing. I thought it was something I did wrong so I read not just one more time but several times to see if I was doing it right. I was right but it still didn't work like it should have. Took it to a friends to see if they could get it to work. Two more people tried and got the same result."
1,Plastic Gears!!!,"My mother purchased this for my daughter for her ninth birthday last month. We were initially impressed by the fact that you could actually knit a scarf. By the second little scarf, though, the gears began to slip. By the end of the thrid scarf you had to manually force the mechanism where the yarn is to even get the crank to turn. The plastic gears simply wore out. Why put plastic gears this type of toy/tool?!?"
4,Modification & HOW TO START INFO HELP,"I have 3 knitting machines the Ultimate Sweater Machine, Innovations, & this Singer. I was able to have experience before buying this one. The instructions are NOT CORRECT! I know that if you feed the yarn in and let it just knit your yarn will UNRAVEL! Take a hint from the Innovations instructions. You need to thread every OTHER one to begin then after one round you can let it take the yarn through the guide on the machine. The other thing is a modification that I did to mine. I didn't like the guide that the yarn had to go through because if there is a mistake it is super hard to get the yarn out without cutting it. I made a small cut (hack saw or dremil tool will do) lengthwise so I can take the yarn out and finish a garment with no problem. I also suggest going on the innovationsknitting yahoo group. There is alot of ideas, tricks & tips for all kinds of circular knitting machines."
4,Just don't use the instructions it comes with and it works fine!,"got this for my 8 year old daughter. At first I was frustrated, it kept unraveling, but then I read the reviews. The instructions for the beginning is wrong! Yes, wrong! I looked on you tube and found a video with instructions on threading a circular machine. You just need to follow that and this machine will work. My daughter completed a fuzzy purple scarf with the yarn in the box and loved it! She did drop a couple stitches right at the end of the project ( her fault not the machine, she stopped halfway in a row) easy fix, you can't tell I had to stitch it up with this fun fur yarn.She wants to make more things, for the 20 bucks I spent it works to what I expected, just don't expect to be able to make complicated items. Scarfs, little iPod bags, headbands will come out fine. There will be seaming/weaving in ends involved."
2,Thought it'd be better.,"I thought this would be a quick and easy way to make tubes but the plastic hooks and gears make this very, very inconsistent. There are lots of dropped stitches and tuck together hooks. Don't waste your time."
2,Not So Hot for Knitting a Sock,"I thought this might be an easy way to knit socks. There were a few favorable reviews sprinkled among the bad, so I decided to give it a try. The biggest problem this gadget has is that they don't bother to smooth the seams on the plastic knitting heads. As a result, yarn snags on the needles when it should slip off as it knits, resulting in dropped stitches and doubled up stitches. This ruins entire knitted pieces and is a real pain to dig out of the machine if you keep going."
1,Absolutely horrible.,"This is an absolutely horrible little machine. I wanted to use it to knit scarves and hats for charity, but it drops stitches, doesnt even work with standard yarn, and didnt work with the eyelash yarn it came with either except for about an inch. The directions were followed exactly and it still didnt work properly.This was a very, very disappointing purchase."
2,It broke the day I opened it.,"The first day I got it, I took it out of the box and started working on a scarg and then the wheel stopped turning completely. Tried to fix it but didn't fix. I was so aggravated. Didn't even get to make anything. :( I got my money back and the store that was with amazon that I got this from was very nice about it."
1,waste of money,product doesn't work right. it drops stitches and gets stuck and i couldn't unhook the yarn with out cutting it. not worth spending your money on.
1,Defective,The knitting machine never worked. When I called for an exchange I was told they no longer had them and was given a refund.
1,Product looks like what a 6yo would make on their own,"No matter what type of yarn, the problem was still the same - very loose stitch. I think that's why Singer puts the fuzzy yarn in the package, so you wont notice how loose the stitch is. Sorry, but I expected better from Singer"
4,Great Product,"I have used this monopod extensively and found it very helpful in difficult shooting situations. The only fault I have found is that it doesn't hold heavy long lenses as well as it could. If you are aware of the balance point and don't overload it, it performs as advertised. I would recomend it in a heart beat."
4,Lightweight and easy to carry,The ball-head holds my camera with a large (telephoto zoom) lens without drifting.Extends to quite a good height - useful but obviously not as steady as a tripod.
1,Piece of junk (from china),"I'm generous with my one star. Wouldn't want to put my Canon EOS 1D Mark 111 on this monopod. Returned the item and purchased a Manfrotto, what a difference. If you want a light weight china quality monopod stick with the Canon."
5,Canon Monopod 100 Review,"It was what I expected. It is compact and light enough to pack for traveling. The quick-release locks on the leg allow for easy extension and retraction. The pan head is an added convenience some other low-end pods do not have. I will be using it with my 12X zoom with 1.5X tele-converter for added stability. Although I have not yet taken the trip for which I purchased it, I expect it to serve me well when the time arrives."
5,Thoughts on the Cannon monopod.,"The Cannon Monopod is an inexpensive, convenient way to steady the larger, heavier cameras. It's easy to use and easy to store."
5,Nice option,The Canon monopod has been great for my high school digital graphics and multimedia classes. We have used it with both digital and video cameras. It was offered for a good price but seems strong and durable. It folds into a small stick size that is very portable.
4,Canon Monopod 100 for SLR Cameras & Lens,"Solid design, quick and easy to adj height. Great way to steady camera. Doubles as walking stick."
2,Canon Monopod 100,"Appeared to be a rather sturdy monopod but after about 3 weeks of shooting various sporting events, on section of the retractable leg is sticking quite badly now. I'd say spend the extra money for a better product."
3,So So For DSLRs,"I liked this a lot for the 1st few weeks of use (every weekend, kid's games, etc). Relatively light, and pretty stable. Now, after about a month, the lock for the camera mount doesn't lock as tightly as it did initially, and I really needed to (over)tighten it each time to prevent the camera/lens from tilting. My camera is a Rebel XT - certainly not a heavy DSLR. I have sinced replaced the Monopod 100 with a Manfrotto monopod w/separate head/mount..."
5,Better Than Expected,"Lightweight, sturdy, and easy adjustment. This is exactly what I was looking for to take to the National Parks where a tripod would be a burden."
5,Outstanding value,"I have owned this monopod for several months and am very happy with it's versatility. The light weight, small size when collapsed and miniballhead all combine to make a very useful addition to my photo kit. Although I have expensive Gitzo tripods & Canon DSLRs, I find this Canon monopod gets a lot of use. I keep it in the car and often having it immediately available makes the difference in getting that unexpected photo. Although the price is amazingly low, it is a high quality product, and attractive as well. Highly recommend."
4,"Great monopod, not to be used with heavy lenses though!","Definitely convenient than carrying my tripod, this monopod has served me well on several occasions. I use it mostly with my D200 and my 18-200mm VR with the VR turned off. The monopod can be opened and closed very quickly and works very well. I have tried using it with my 80-200 f/2.8D at times, but I would prefer not to do that.As it is light, I usually carry this monopod with me most of the times as opposed to my tripod that I prefer leaving at home unless I am taking it in my car.For the price, I would definitely recommend it to everyone."
5,Canon Monopod,Canon Monopod 100 for SLR Cameras & LensesI bought this monopod as a replacement for one I lost hiking in Idaho. This works very well for me. I use it for a Sony video camera and an Canon SLR camera and it does a wonderful job. It is very easy to set up and the quick release works flawlessly. It is tall enough to extend it to eye level. It collapses small enough to pack in a suitcase. I don't know why anyone would want to spend more on a monopod as this one fits all my needs.
4,So Far Very Useful,I have not had this monopod for very long. This is my first monopod and so far I like it a lot. It's not the strongest piece of equipment but It does well with my Evolt E 500. I have not used it very long so it may disappoint me still. I will update this review if there are any major flaws. One problem I do have is that there is no quick release plate. This makes a problem with screwing and unscrewing your camera from the monopod. The threads of the camera screw can ware out creating an expensive problem. A separate attachment can probably be bought.
5,Great for zoom cameras,"I use this with my Canon S3IS which (with 1.5x teleconverter)has 18x magnification. It extends up almost to my full 6'4"" height... I'm not doubling over to use it. So far it has proven sturdy enough. Sometimes I find myself using it as a walking stick too.Definitely got my money's worth out of this one!"
4,canon monopod,"The canon monopod was just what I wanted. It is lightweight and very maneuverable even with my large telephoto lense. If you want the heavy lense supported turn the swivel head so that the camera rests on the side bracket of the ball head for support, it works fairly well. I would buy this again as I shoot a lot of bird and wildlife pictures so a tripod would not give me the flexibility that the monopod does."
5,Ten seconds after it arrived,"I popped open the carton, checked out the monopod, and headed to the trail. It works nicely, and as others have mentioned, it seems sturdy enough to use as a walking stick -- although you would NOT, of course ever want to keep the camera attached if you're using the monopod as a walking stick! It extends above the eye level of my humble 5ft 9in frame, and really reduces camera shake and blur, suitable enough for the 35x zoom on my video camera, and all the more so for the modest zoom on my point and shoot camera. It beats lugging around a tripod. Great buy.*Follow-upIt can't be killed. I have tortured this monopod, dragged it through swamps, smacked it on rocks, stuck it in mud, and threatened a nasty dog. It had never occurred to me that it might have self-defense value, but what the heck! I'm really, really happy with this purchase."
5,"Small, sturdy and suitable as walking stick",Collapses smaller than other monopods I looked at. Fit snugly into my suitcase. But sturdy. I have used it as walking stick.
5,Canon Monopod,"I was very pleased with Amazons quick delivery of my new Canon monopod.The monopod is very easy to adjust and use. It's the ideal ridgid support you would want for your camera.It even doubles as a great walking stick, sometime need, on those long treks you make to get a good photo."
4,Good Purchase,"Strong and rigid, easy to control on the head so that you can have it loose for free movement but tight enough that the camera doesn't flop over. Opens and closes very easily. It's kind of expensive for $50 but its probably worth the money."
5,Good Monopod,"Bought this monopod nearly a year now and love it!! Have not used it much, but it works well when i need it.I am 5'10"" tall and when i have my nikon d40 mounted at full extension i have to tip on my toes to see through the eyepiece. Therefore, it should work well for persons in excess of 6' tall with larger cameras.The head feels solid but i cant say how it would perform with much heavier cameras. Treat it well and it will return the favour."
4,canon digital camera SI2 monopod,"It works fine, but the Canon S2 IS digital camera sometimes feels a little heavy for the monopod."
4,mono pod for my SLR camera,Wasn't exactly what I needed but will be able to use it..Canon Monopod 100 for SLR Cameras & Lenses
5,It's Worth It!,"If you are just starting to play bass or if you are primarily a guitar player (like me), trying to add bass to your arsenal, this DVD is what you are looking for. The instructor is informative and interesting enough without boring you with unnecessary details. I've been playing guitar (non-pro) for over 40 years but with bass it's been on and off again. This DVD inspired me to stick with it. It covers some great songs and it was easy enough to learn from. If there is any difference from the original recording and what was taught on this DVD I didn't notice it and I could play along with the original recordings without a problem. In any case it sounded good to me! This DVD helped me feel closer to being a bass player and I think it will help you too."
4,Great Bass Licks,"A great collection of Bass licks for the Beatles. Featuring a great player by the name of Bob Efford, he breaks down the best of the Beatles and their style."
4,"Ah, Vecna, my canny foe, we meet again...","One could make the defeat of Vecna the focus of 2 or 3 campaigns; the 3 adventures that star Vecna (Vecna Lives!, Vecna Reborn, and Die, Vecna, Die!)are certainly not for the faint of heart or low of level. Die, Vecna, Die! is an epic adventure that falls just a bit short due to the fact it seems a bit too pre-programmed, leading the adventurers by the nose at times. It does bring the story arc for Vecna closer to a conclusion, but relies too heavily on plot contrivances that negate some of what has come before in the other Vecna adventures, such as the revelation that the Sword of Kas that we've seen in Vecna Lives! is a replica, not the original, or that, oh, by the way, there IS a way for the Sword to defeat Vecna. This module also suffers in comparison to Vecna Lives!, which managed to evoke a truly terrifying atmosphere. However, this is a fine adventure well worth checking out."
5,An Adventure at 3 Planes.,"This is a very good adventure! In this adventure module, you have the oportunity to start in GREYHAWK, travel RAVENLOFT and, after this, to SIGIL (PLANESCAPE), with the presence of great AD&D pictures: Vecna, Iuz (the GOD) and Lady of Pain. The adventure is developed in three parts: 1: In Oerth the heroes discover that a Vecna temple, with odd dimensional properties, has been seiged by a powerful army commanded by Iuz. 2: Takes the heroes to Cavitius in Ravenloft, where Iuz is about to confront Vecna in the Maimed Lord's palace. 3: The final part of the adventure plays out in Sigil, the City of Doors, as Vecna prepares to challenge the Lady of Pain herself.This is realy a different adventure! A domain Lord escapes from Ravenloft, a god entering Sigil, Really these are things that do not happens frequently! And the best at this adventure is that it is completely good!"
5,"Goodbye 2nd edition, Hello 3rd","As the final module for 2nd edition D&D, I think this is a classic. It's the first Greyhawk storyline I've run in over 10 years, but well worth it. I like to have a sense of continuity and cohesiveness in my campaigns, and although Ravenloft got a little play in my games I never really liked it. This module gives me the chance to essentially blow it away but maintain it's relevance to my ongoing campaign (now at to 19 years)!The module also served as a nice sendoff to the realms of Greyhawk, Ravenloft, and Planescape, none of which will be officially supported by WotC once 3rd Edition D&D arrives. It's a killer of a module, one that will be difficult for DMs to handle and players to survive, but the ending is extrememly satisfying. I highly recommend this module!"
5,"Four friends, some classical songs, one great concert","This CD records a concert, a reunion where friends gather to enjoy and sing each other's songs. I've gone through it several times, always finding new ways to say those classical themes, ranging from El Blues del Autobus, Solo le pido a Dios, La Fiesta, to Cantares, Contaminame, while revisiting Quiero Abrazarte Tanto; these friends gather and enjoy each other while singing joyfully with new voices, reunion. This CD is a must have for those of us who love Serrat, Belen, Rios and Victor Manuel, and share their taste for other composers, while filling our listening experience with the nostalgia emerging from Paraules D'Amor, a common experience for all of us and our own teenage love experiences."
2,This book is for the old pcat version!,"I just recently took my pcats on Nov 20th and I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this book. After reading the reviews for this book I thought that this was the PERFECT book for me. When I took the Pcats, however, this book only contained about 1/3 of the information that I needed to know about Chem and Bio. I studied this book night and day, and I knew this book from front to back. Also, organic chemistry was a third of the Chem section, and Kaplan did not cover all the info that was needed to do well on that section. Surprisingly, biology was a lot harder than Chemistry, while the verbal section was easy.(mainly because Kaplan failed to include the essentials for the test)This book might have been great for the Pcats before they made changes to it, but to me this book was absolutely useless in preparing me for my Pcats."
5,Great PCAT book,This is the cheaper alternative to paying for the class. My score increased by 15 points. It is much better than Barron's prep book because the book is divided in to chapters and lessons - not just pretests.
1,An Exact Copy of DAT,"This book is a word by word copy of DAT. It's sily to say this book is designed for PCAT. The Verbal part is also a copy from other Kaplan books, not directly related to PCAT."
2,GO WITH BARRONS PCAT REVIEW,"Go with Barrons books... they're much more cost effective, and not to mention more helpful!"
3,"Returning, but good for some uses",I am returning this for the sole reason that a single stopwatch can't be reset to zero. All of them have to be reset. This makes it unusable for me because I was going to time commutes and other things and want the ability to reset one of the three timers.I am rating it 3 stars because for sporting events resetting all timers to zero might be OK.Hopefully this review can help people make a more informed buying decision.
1,Not worth it for first timers,"I purchased this dvd, because I wanted to learn how to play the keyboard. The instructor went from showing you the scale right into playing music with his band. Definately not for someone playing for the first time. Do not waste your money."
4,A hot seat!,"The Little Rascals are at their best here. The funniest by far is Too, Two, Young, where Alfalfa learns a very hot lesson about stealing someone else's things. Thankfully, he is able to extinguish his seat in the nick of time. Sizzling fun!"
3,crude reality but not very literary,"This book isn't a novel: is the true life of the own author, Arturo Barea, written in England and in originally in English because the author died in exile. In these sense this book is an extensive and detailed recording of the life in Spain between about 1900- 1939, a period of bitterness and decadence and all that is told with truthfulness and has great interest if you are interested in that, but lacks of literary professionality and the narration is purely linear withouth any artifice. For that perhaps the story results sometimes a little pedestrian, but in general the strong force of the facts related hiddens a more polished form."
3,"OK, yet kind of disappointing, compared to the first 2 novels...","I'm a huge ""Omen"" fan, and I own all the novels up to this one. I'm about 2/3 of the way through the book, and I must say while it does have some very chilling scenes....it just seems lacking somehow. The first 2 novels were superb, tightly paced and the characters well fleshed out. The novel that precedes this one: ""The Final Conflict"" was written by the same author as ""Omen IV"", and I recognize the prose. The story is just much too rushed, characters jump from here to there without much of an even flow.The characters become confusing as to who is who sometimes, and while it is a decent entry, it needs more ""Omen menace"" to it.I will say its VERY fascinating and refreshing to have the Son Of God play a role in this tale!"
3,Beats the film by a long shot,"OMEN IV: ARMAGEDDON 2000 takes up where THE FINAL CONFLICT left off. The reader finds out what really happened after Damien Thorn's demise, including the true nature of the conception of his son (no, not his daughter, as the made-for-TV movie might make you believe). It is more faithful to the spirit of the OMEN series than OMEN IV the TV movie is. It is also more faithful to its evangelical Protestant roots."
3,Novel sequel lacks novel ideas.,"Omen IV: Armageddon 2000 picks up ninth months after the events of The Final Conflict, then jumps ahead 18 years. The son of Damien (Grandson of the Devil?) is living in seculsion, hidden from the world, and protected by Paul Buher (a character Damien 'befriended' in Omen 2) the head of the once mighty Thorn Corporation. Several characters are taken from the opening montage of The Final Conflict and dispatched in clumsy 'accidents' before the novel stumbles to its conclusion. Other than Buher's crisis of faith (he is considering converting to Christianity) there is of little interest here. At least it's superior to the terrible tele-sequel."
5,Puzzle! Action! Strategy!,"Mind Grind is a puzzle game with 3,000 questions but also offers strategy and action elements.On one level you must avoid whirlwinds while climbing up pillars, on another you must make your way through a maze of gates and on another you maneuver a ship through space while carefully avoiding meteoroids and shooting plasma blasts at crafts which contain questions.During your quest, a game-show-like host called Homer is your guide. He provides useful instructions but also makes sarcastic comments and heckling throughout the game."
3,"good stuff, but too expensive","Used the lotion for a long time, but will discontinue. The price isnot competitive with like products. So unfortunately will buy competitors product."
2,Such a waste...,"If you could find a way to remove Elvis Costello's voice track from the recording, this would be a very good disc. If you could replace him with a competent R&B or soul singer, it would be a fantastic one (especially if he slurred the lyrics). As it is, it's just unlistenable. EC never was much of a singer, but here he's way out of his depth -- off-key whitebread bombast is not what this kind of music calls for. His voice is fingernails on the blackboard bad, and it's relentless... there's not even a single instrumental track to relieve the pain. It kills me to toss any disc with Allen Toussaint on it, but this one's got to go."
2,"Yous stole the King's name, now what?","I wish E.C. would stop crapping all over my favorite artists. First he stunk up The Mingus Big Band with his pseudo-intellectual lyrics and over-blown, operatic delivery; now he's squatting over Toussaint--and all that sweet N.O. R&B--which The Great Pretender can now pollute with his I'm-a-legend-in-my-own-eyes arrogance. He should collaborate with Sting, another self-indulgent bag of UK wind. They could be billed as ""Brothers of the Loo."""
4,I liked it...,"This is a pretty good compilation. ""Asiyah Dub"" is actually quite mind-melting, the rest, intense, better-than-average D'n'B. Definitely worth a listen."
2,"Great Films, Poor Program Design","Each and every one of these films certainly deserves a five star rating, however, for all you owners of multi-disc DVD changers, you're going to be sadly disappointed when you try and program your machines for an evening of entertainment. All five of the discs will not play in the program and/or repeat mode. At least that's the case with both of my 5 disc Sony players. I've had this problem arise with a few other, mostly inexpensive off brand discs, but this is the first time I've run across this issue with a Warner Brothers product and I'm very upset to say the least. The WB needs to re-evaluate their quality control."
3,Too Small,I really didnt read the product information very well on this ring. I wasnt really happy when I got it. The sunflowers are so small you canbarely see them on the ring. It looks like you just have a band on.Would not recommend.
3,slater is just trying to amke more money,this book countinues slaters ramblings he isa a good author its jsut that his books are not realistic i like them though because they are cool
1,Garbage,"I did not read this book, nor do I care to. It is very clear that Mr. Slater might be a great writer, he does not know anything about this issue. Anyone who slanders the Militia, needs to have their head examined. The Militia is not only called for in our most important documents but it is necessary. The media and people like Mr. Slater make the Militia look bad to discredit them and turn people away from them. The day will come when people like Mr. Slater will be thankful there is a Militia around, as they will be the only means of safety there is. I do not support anyone who defends this person or sells his book. sincerely, Warren Nelson"
5,Original Stuff!,"This is a full length CD containing all original music by a very talented group of Indiana musicians. They obviously worked very hard to put together these unique selections for their first CD.I have seen them live in clubs in Indiana & surrounding states on several occasions, and they have always put on a great show. I recommend this one to anyone willing to listen to something new!!!"
5,Definitely Order one size larger!,"Definitely Order one size larger!Read other comments that you should order one size larger and they were right! Usually wear an large but got the XL and it fits perfectly. Quality product, sturdy, comfortable. Tested it out before Tough Mudder nationals this November and not worried about feet getting too cold."
2,Excellent Imperial Ruler,"However, my mistake was that I assumed it would be metric on one side and imperial on the other. I needed a metric ruler, sotherefore no good to me, but definately my error. Ruler is strong and robust and very good value for money if you need animperial rule. Post and service was excellent."
5,A Must for all Pianophiles,"This collection of so-called ""calling cards"", though the word does not do it justice, is a brilliant display of pianism on the part of Hamelin and by all the ocmposers who are represented here, even in three delightful selections of the performer's own oeuvre. From the bright Godowsky Tocatta and Rachmaninov selections, to the dark Scriabin poems, and riotous Hamelin Prelude and Fugue, this is a collection that should be owned by every lover of piano music. Though I have only possessed this album for a scant week, I have enjoyed the élan at least three times a day each day. In fact, Hamelin's own works make me wish that he would finish his series of minor key etudes and record them so that we might rejoice in their splendour! This record is another gem in Hyperion's starry crown!"
3,Lacks suspense,"Often with true crime, you know up front who the murderer is, so the interesting part is what mistakes did he make, what circumstances or character development led to the crime(s), how the police solved it and how the trial played out.In this book, the motive is vague (insurance money, anger at father's desertion) and the character description doesn't really unfold enough for the reader to make an assessment.The police part is pretty ho-hum, without many breakthroughs, mostly bumbling along. The final trial isn't included in the book.I'm sure if I were a friend or family member, it would be riveting despite these drawbacks, but for me it was not a very satisfying example of true crime writing."
4,A shocking account of the judicial system's short comings.,"Having known Irene and grown up with her as part of the family this was a very difficult book for me to read. I was so shocked to learn of all the mistakes that the police force made. I also thought it such a shame that even though there were those that were suspicious from the beginning, they were blown off. I thought the book dealt with facts very well although it is difficult to read when there are emotions involved as well. I look forward to Jack being tried and justice to be served, because up until now there has been nothing done to cause faith in the judicial system. To Irene's family my heart goes out to you and please be consoled by the fact that you had an amazingly beautiful daughter, inside and out."
5,Riveting,"A very well written account of a bizarre personality who murdered his wife, his kids and his mother. A realatively short book, but a real page turner, in that the story and suspense moves along without getting bogged down in a lot of superfulous detail. A very good book."
4,Pretty good,"This was a good book but a little more depth, or detail, would've improved it somewhat. One can't help but feel sympathy for this doomed family, especially for the two innocent children. How someone can have it in them to kill their own child is one of those mysteries that most of us will never be able to understand; perhaps that's for the best."
4,VERY SAD STORY,"Dying For Daddy: A True Story of Family Killer Jack Barron (St. Martin's True Crime Library)I HAD NOT HEARD ABOUT THIS CRIME, AND TO BE HONEST, IT CAUGHT MY EYE BECAUSE MY MAIDEN NAME IS BARRON. I THOUGHT THE STORY WAS WELL WRITTEN AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING. IT IS FASCINATING THAT A PERSON'S MIND COULD BE SO WARPED THAT HE COULD KILL THOSE PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND CARED FOR HIM SO EASILY. THE PSYCOLOGY IS WHAT INTRIGUES ME."
5,"I HEARD THIS STORY IN MY SPEECH CLASS, I AM SO SORRY....","AFTER I HEARD THIS STORY IN MY SPEECH CLASS TODAY, I FELT SORRY FOR THIS PERSON WHO GAVE THIS PRESENTATION. SHE ADDRESSES THAT SEEING A MURDER FACE TO FACE IS HORRIBLE AND UNDESCRIBABLE. THIS LADY CONVINCED ME THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE AMMENDED TO THOSE WHO COMMIT CRIMES AND MURDERS WITHOUT THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT, AFTER I LEFT THAT ROOM, I WENT STRAIGHT TO BORDERS AND BOUGHT THE BOOK. I WANTED TO KNOW MORE, BECAUSE THIS STORY WAS TRUE."
4,Great Book but----,"why didn't the author wait to write it AFTER THE TRIAL. I just bought this book (year 2000) and apparently this apparently evil man almost got away with murder of his wife, 2 kids and mother. He vehemently denies committing these unthinkable horrific crimes but one is left with no other suspects; I was extremely disappointed that at the time this book came out the suspect was awaiting trial sometime in 1998. I want to know the outcome of the trial-can anyone give me more information about the trial or where I can find the information myself?"
2,Poorly writtten!,"I am always annoyed when I read a book that lacks grammatical correctness. It is a sign of poor writing skills and/or sloppy editing. For me, it detracts from the story line and interferes with the smooth flow of the book.I found the plot line to this book to be hapharard. At times it's difficult to determine who is narrating the story. The author is very repetitive. Also, don't look for a conclusion to the story.This book was written prematurely. My guess is the author couldn't wait to write the book so he could start raking in the bucks.Consequently, we're not informed of the outcome. Isn't that 99.99% of the reason for reading true crime books?This one's a rip off!"
3,"Short, To the Point","As a true crime reader, I'm used to sogging through details of places and the players involved (often times to a distraction). This book dives into the heart of the story without really building too much on the ""extras"". The story itself is astonishing; a father kills his family one by one as the police sit by because a ""cause of death"" could not be determined. I wish the book were a little longer, and the details more explored. If you like your TC streamlined, pick this book up! Great for reading in one sitting."
3,The common denominator is Jack Barron,"I just finished reading ""Dying for Daddy"" by Carlton Smith. The story is fascinating - a man's wife dies in bed, then his son dies in bed, then his daughter dies in bed, and finally his mother dies in bed. What a coinkidink! The story is told in a simple and direct way. It held my interest and it would have even been better if I found out what happens to the murderer, Jack Barron, in the end. I would not read this book again."
3,Meh,"The mascara is a great color, but the consistency is just too dry, even newly out of the tube. It ends up flaking by the end of the day. Very sad because I had heard great things about this mascara. What I will say however is that it adds great volume, but no length. It also tends to clump if you try and apply more than one coat."
2,"Unreliable with high volumes of email, weak spam guard","Eudora 3.x and 4.x become unreliable with thousands of emails in the Inbox. The symptom is a message saying that the Inbox table of contents is corrupt, and offering to rebuild. If you say YES you will probably loose all your email permanently! The correct answer is to say no, exit Eudora, then use File Find to locate inbox.toc and delete this file, which will delete the table of contents but not the email. Then Eudora can recover.Another suggestion that has improved the reliability for me is to have an automatic filter that copies all messages from Inbox into Inboxsafe, which might be slightly less vulnerable to corruption. The last suggestion is to make sure the boxes don't get very full. Don't take vacations :(Regarding spamguard, there is no spamguard built in to Eudora. I have set up filters that detect and delete common spam, but have not been able to figure out how to automatically forward this spam to spamcop."
3,Good reference,"This book is a good reference for graduate level reading and MEMS researchers. The author writes clearly and does a good job of highlighting important work in the field. However, the main problem with the book is the organization and the multiple forward references. Many terms are not explained the first time around (and appear two sections or a chapter later). The references are not numbered and are somewhat difficult to look up by name. The same problem with figures. The book classifies sensors and actuators according to their primary function (mechanical, thermal, optical...). Accurate references with page or section numbers to other chapters would help particularly with such a classification. Madou's ""Fundamentals of Microfabrication"" book and Sze's ""Semiconductor Sensors"" book complement this book nicely."
4,A good Introduction,Written in 1998 the book is getting a little long in the tooth and needs some updating. However the principles of many types of MEMS tranducers are covered as well as the basic process technology. It is probably the still best introduction to MEMS you can buy. The organisational structure of the book make it a good starting reference as each topic is dealt with in a fairly self contained way.Expensive but worth the money.
4,interesting,purchased for a class in college. MEMs are pretty awesome and this book is a good intro...but not what id call in depth.
5,It is truly a shame that this book is out of print.,Every police officer in America should read every word of this outstanding manual and train and use these tactics. No other manual contains so much practical and tested tactics than the Tactical Edge. Mr. Remsburg has made an incredible contribution to police officers all over the world.
1,This is NOTa leather bag!,Customers! Beware! This bag is made of %100 PVC! Which is pure plastic NOT leather! I could find a piece of plastic way cheaper than $150.
1,Why is this bag continuously out of stock?????????????,"Can't find it in black, can't find it in red, Bloomingdales is always out, Maxx New York is always out, Amazon is always out. Any idea when you may have it back in stock??? Since November it has been unavailable. Why carry it at all on the site if it's never available. I'm sure it's a gorgeous bag...too bad no one can get one!!!"
2,OVERPRICED; NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This set is small and overpriced. It is NOT worth $43. Your best bet is to go to Wal-Mart or the 99 cent store and get regular, adult-sized cook ware...like a few small pots, a small frying pan, etc. That would be much cheaper and much better quality."
5,Quality Realistic Cooking Set,Got these to go with my daughter's new play kitchen for Christmas. They are so cute and realistic. She LOVES them! Love how the lids are interchangeable. And I love that is comes with a teapot! We love making strawberry tea and them driking it out of her little cups.
2,Sad but true,This video is rather cheasy. Save your money and put it towards a Tommy Igoe or Mike Portnoy video. The instructor is a terrible teacher with no personality. You might learn something but you would learn so much more with another video. It is one of those videos where you would think the guys in the band were trying to look silly. I think the other review was written by the instructor himself. If you need a good laugh buy this video.
3,Didn't Last But Warranty Is Good,"I purchased this at the end of February, and it worked fine right out of the box. I didn't really have to use it, except for some momentary outages, just enough to shut off the computer if I didn't have it, but not long enough for the auto generator to kick in.A little over six months later, I wake up to the beeping indicating it's on battery power. There were not outages the night before. I tried resetting it, unplugging everything from the unit, moving to a different outlet, and more. But after the four minutes (even with nothing on it) it would go into battery power mode. No other alarm lights would come on.I'm giving it 3 stars, because I contacted their support department, and they are sending me a replacement. So in reality I'm rating the warranty and support. I hope it works well, but in the meantime I have purchased a different brand for my own more critical use and will put the replacement on a much smaller and less used system."
1,Do not perform well--getting rid of all in our office,"Purchased many of these for workstations. During outages more than half of these backups did not keep the computer on at all. Loss of work was immeasurable. This has happened on another occasion, we are replacing all Tripp Lite Internet Office UPS devices with the brand APC. These were right at or less than a year old."
2,Battery is not replacable,"Bought this unit in March, 2009. In January, 2012 the battery alarm started sounding constantly even with no load on the unit, so I replaced it with another UPS I had with a new battery in it.Checking the Tripp-Lite site, I was surprised to find that they do not offer a replacement for this unit's battery, and while you might be able to find some suitable battery, installing it is a dicey proposition. For that reason, I'm giving this unit two stars.APC UPS's, which I normally use, all have replaceable batteries, which is a big money saver when they wear out after a few years. It's a waste to have to dispose of a relatively expensive piece of equipment simply because of a bad battery."
4,Wonderful!,"A great diversion from all the pop pablum on the radio, Tom Russell and crew weave some great yarns in songs that are a pleasure to listen to."
1,An Abomination,This video was an abomination. The video was absolutely worthless and the redhead was a huge loser and disappointment to the video. Her dancing:PATHETIC. Poorly constructed and needs tons of work. SNOWMAN OUT
2,Not that great.,I tried these and no matter what I do I can't get them to quick leaking. I have tried every method and they have yet to work correctly.
3,A Solid Effort!,"David L. Dotlich and Peter C. Cairo discuss how to use action coaching to improve individual effectiveness and boost your overall organization. Their approach begins with fostering self-awareness and then uses this awareness to motivate change that the organization needs. Action coaching involves a series of steps and some specific coaching tools. While this book provides a fairly well-organized and well-written introduction to the concept, it covers familiar training and development ground. If you are a beginner in this area, the repetition of steps and processes will come in handy. Experienced trainers will find the coaching tools quite familiar and the assessment questions fairly obvious. Thus, we at getAbstract.com recommend this book for those who are new to training and development, or for employees who are considering getting coached."
4,Solid album for those on a tight budget,"This is the best addition to my CD collection in years. As a grad student who can't afford to spend money on anything other than food and rent, I made the exception to spend my meagre funds on this CD because when real rap comes along you buy it. I've had the album now for 4 weeks, and I bought it only having heard track #2 Weekends. I took a big chance on the BEPs, but I'm glad I did. That said, the first 10 tracks are particularly good. Of those, #2,#3, & #7 are the ones you program into your CD player and repeat for hours on end, #5 and #9 also when you need some space between the repeats. Not quite sure what happened after track 10 so I can't give it 5 stars. Why this album over Common, De La or Mos Def's, only because Weekends hooked me, if I wasn't mostly broke I probably would have splurged for all of the above after giving them all a proper listen."
4,NOT AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST,"Bridging the gap is good, don't get me wrong. But in a time when so many hip hoppers are getting over the whole Bentley and b**ches tip and more and more rappers and MC's are rising up talking about the philosophy, art, and craft of hip hop, BEP just doesn't cut it as sharply as they did a few years back when their first album came out. Guest appearances by De La Soul, and Chali Tuna from Jurassic 5, and Wyclef, who, after his collaboration with The Rock struggles for credibility, only make this album seem more like a last bid attempt at striking new ground. But the ground's already struck. Look to the aforementioned Jurassic 5 and Deltron 3030 for the future of hip hop. Bridging the Gap's sound is just too tinged with yesteryear."
3,"Some cornbread, & greens!","Like so many others before them, the new Black Eyed Peas joint suffers from the infamous sophomore jinx. Their latest release will be a pleasure for die hard fans, but fans who are tasting the BEP's for the first time may want to add some cornbread and greens to make this auditory meal a little more delightful. The BEP's raised the bar so high on their first release, that their was no hope for the second helping. ""Bridging the Gap"", is fair, not great. In the future the BEP's .... ""Damn this review's making me hungry""!!!!"
2,Look around,"I have more respect for BEP than a lot of other groups around. Thing is, its a shame to say, but its party rap. It really is. Its not even good party rap. Its better rap than your P Diddy's and Mase's but.....nothanks. Its like, there are things within it are could almost be J5. NOT J5, but nearly at the very bottom standard of it. I dont see the point of this CD. You either go out and buy hip hop, or you buy a remix of a dance song. This tries to combine both....once again......no thankyou. Yeah, they can breakdance. Thats pretty cool, but its not worth a CD, just a handshake. If youre thinking about getting this....eheh, dont. Get J5, or Illmatic by Nas. Try out Lewis Parker or Deltron 3030. If you DONT care about borderline RNB/HIP HOP, then get it. Youll probably love it."
3,Sub-Par,"I really enjoyed their first album. It was really diferent and the flows and beats were hittin. The first album I gave it 4 stars. This album gets 2 stars but I gave it 3 stars because I like the group. It just wasnt there like their last album. I dont know what it is. Maybe it was the featuring of wack people like Wycleaf and Macy Gray. But Mos def and Les Nubians were alright. I dont know but this album just did not grab my ears and say listen to this sh**, but instead said turn this sh** off!"
5,"Great watch but,,,,",The Suunto watch is a great piece of gear. It was not a mistake that Outdoor magazine rated it a best watch of the year 2003.The compass is ulike any other one in a watch it is real time and as you move the watch the compass corrects itself.Pls the addition of the pc connectivity makes it a must have if you are serious about keeping track of any workout.The only issue which Suunto is working hard to correct is a glitch in the software that makes the watch blanks out. This is apparently a flau in some watches and the repair is done by suunto free of charge and the warranty is extended by an extra year.Lastly if you are concerned about the screen t is mineral crystal so it is hard and will take the punishment.
3,Good but buggy,"Beautiful looking watch, light weight, menu functions are easy to navigate. HR chest strap worked well (better than my other HR watches from Timex and Sports Instruments)Software is very buggy and crashes frequently (but no information lost so thats ok).One big problem - the watch claims to measure both altitude (Hiking Mode) and air pressure (Weather Mode), but can't do both at once. The watch determines your current altitude by using surrounding air pressure - if you sit in one place for hours and the air pressure changes around you the watch thinks you've changed altitude! My watch sat on my desk for two days and when I checked the altitude log, it showed several meters of altitude change - when all that happened was a storm hand moved into the region!Big Warning - make sure when you buy a 2004 model you're getting the current model. The Suunto website has a 2004 manual for the X6HR that claims there is an Air Pressure Calibration function on the watch (General"
3,"Good watch, put pricey","I was looking for a ""one watch fits all"", this one does the job. The Suunto X6HR is a lot like the Casio G-Shock series of watches but not so bulky. I was afraid the watch would be too big but found it not quite as tall as the G-Shocks and a lot more rounded and ergonomic. As for the display, it is functional but I like the G-Shock format better. The menus on the watch take some getting use to but no big deal. The backlight bothers me a little in the fact that you have to hold the button for 2 seconds before it will light up (normal mode). I also wish the alarm were louder, I'm sure I'll sleep right through the weak beeps. The thermometer, barometer, and compass are very accurate, I like that. I also liked the mineral glass face. I always scratch up my plastic face watches when I am outdoors. The PC interface is easy to use but requires a serial port. The software is well written. Overall, a good watch that does it all. I'd say it is more of a $200 watch than a $450 watch."
2,"Yes, STAY AWAY","I've got to agree with the other reviews about tech support and buggy (and I mean BUGGY) software. The SAM software is quite unstable (Think Windows 2.0 kind of unstable). I like the watch and I like the functions that it provides. The interface on the watch is really nice. It's a shame that their analysis software is so un-reliable. Support on their website is almost non-existent. The last problem I had, I had to solve myself and that took quite a bit of digging to findout what to do. I found the information on a bulletin board that was run by other users of this product.I'd have been better served with more reliable software. Perhaps I'll pass this HRM on to a needy student and spend another chunk of change on a Polar this time...Good Luck"
3,Great Watch - Eats Batteries,"I have had this watch for about a year now. Great watch, many functions, all work flawlessly. The only problem and it can be a major one, is that this thing goes through batteries unlike any watch I have ever owned. If you get 3 months out of a battery you are lucky. After going through 2 batteries very quickly, I thought maybe I had bought old or bad batteries. The last 2 I had tested before I installed them. Same problem. I'm now on my way to buy my 5th battery for this watch in about 1 year. If this doesn't bother you I highly recommend this watch, but it can be very frustrating if your battery fails at a bad time."
2,"Good, but the software is awful","I have had this product for a month. The machine itself is great and is both a pleasure to use as well as highly useful for improving your cycling.Less can be said, however, for the software. I have been plagued by problems in uploading data and have wasted hours on it. Next time I will go for something with USB accessibility as the sonic port system is very troublesome."
4,Good HRM at good price,"I have had this HRM for about a year now. It has preformed pretty well for me. I did have a problem that after my first ride, I put the bike in the back of my truck and drove home through a big thunderstorm with the computer getting very wet and highway speed wind and the computuer stopped working. They promptly replaced it and the second one has been working great. Make sure you read the manual and get the wheel size set correctly."
1,Never worked,"I bought this to replace a old but functional Echo W-1 that doesn't have heart rate monitoring capabilities. Installation was as expected, though the mounts for the CS200 are cheap and cannot be adjusted after the unit and sensors are installed. This is disappointing considering that much cheaper cycling computers have better mounts. I was never able to get the speed sensor to work. The computer never got a reading, despite spending an hour trying different mount configurations.Ultimately, I chose to return this. Lots of message boards complain about broken/erratic Polar speed sensors, so I've remounted my old but reliable bike computer."
4,quirky family favorite,collection of vintage recordings that you won't find anywhere else. It is road music that is requested every year. Some hits and misses but very unique. Yorgi yorgensen song makes everyone laugh.
4,A Fun Mostly Robot Collection,"An interesting little book great for amusement. Large photo format shows nice detail, as most of the pictures fill a page. Organized simply by decade, not much info is given on each toy save title, maker, and size. Very little of the merchandise packaging is shown. Simply a fun book, but not useful for a serious collector."
5,got me so stoked i acrually teared up... a bit...,"... and I'm a guy. I bought this for my wife, and I'll admit I'm a bit surf deprived lately, and definitely very stressed, but I've been trying to encourage her to follow through with her dream to learn to surf for a long time. This book said everything I tried to tell her an much much more. despite the fact that I got a bit emotional looking through this book, I'm sort of a manly man and she feels like I don't understand her fear of water or appreciate her challenges when it comes to surfing , (which is probably true.) This book addressed so many issues so much better than I ever could have that I can't say enough positive about it. It addresses real issues without all the surf hype: its genuine and helpful. Plus it provides perspectives from for all kinds of surfers from pros, to kids, to adult beginners. its really inspiring both for her, and me, an average surfer guy who wishes he could get out a little more often."
3,"It works, but you better be a sound sleeper!","The included fan is noisy. Very noisy. Why they couldn't come up with a 12v fan from a computer that puts out almost as much air but is whisper-quiet is beyond me.I've never used the heater simply because I've never been cold enough to warrant putting up with the noise ... not to mention that you have to figure out how to keep the unit out of the wind! I still take it along, if I'm already taking propane and a spare 12V battery, since it packs nicely into its carrying case and some day I might actually want to stay in the tent and read because it's pouring down rain.Otherwise, just hunker down next to the fire until bedtime and crawl into a sleeping bag."
1,FRAUD ALERT -- NO SARAH BRIGHTMAN,"One would think, as I did, that Sarah Brightman is the pianist, or at least appears on this CD, as the fraudulent title suggests. WRONG!!! Ms. Brightman, the Diva of Divas, appears absolutely NOWHERE on this CD. DO NOT BE DUPED as I was."
1,PROTECTED CD,PROTECTED CD WONT PLAY PROPERLY ON COMPUTER. Great cd but not for you if you want to rip it.
5,Wild Horses,"This story captured my heart the first time I saw it. Although I missed the first 22 minutes of it on the TV. It was one of those movies that they showed once, and seemed like it never got a second play. I was very pleased when I saw it come to DVD and ordered it the same day."
4,good for older kids,Good story about helping those who are hurting and helpless. Held my attention to the end. The horses are beautiful. There was one crack at the Catholic church for its stand on morality. My 8 year old was a little disturbed by the nightmare sequences involving the deaths of a character's family members.
5,Jane Seymour blew me away!,"I had no idea that she could play such a moving and provoking role. I first saw her in Somewhere in Time (just loved it) and other films where she showed her ""softer"" side. This movie displayed a very different Jane. I was convinced by her acting and could totally relate to the predicaments all three found themselves. I'm not sure that younger children would ""get it"" but the messages are loud and clear and worth hearing again and again. Kudos to the author, cast & crew!"
4,The Heart,"Jane Seymour, Aunt Fiona a lonely reclusive life on a beatiful Island distrupted by a young 12 year old . lots of family emotions , both aunt and Mark learning to cope with each other and straining the relationship with the treasure hunting park ranger who's self centered on being the only one to stay on the island. the glue a small herd of wild pony horsesthat live on the island and by law should not be touched with human hands.Of course Mark breaks that rule as he is adjusting to seeing nature ,and a young colt thats lost his mother , surival ,from the compassion of a young boy , who through his lost helps the colt to live and helps his aunt fiona to find her family love ,faith , compassion for family.A very good movie to help all the family to see relationship between people and nature. worth seeing and putting in your library for those cold family monents that need stirring up with love.Luddy"
3,Not for Complete Beginners,"I have this one on VHS. I agree with other comments that tab or at least chord diagrams would have been helpful, especially for beginners. For intermediate players it should be OK. I think Hal Leonard wants you to buy their books too."
5,Fabulous,He is always one step ahead! This is absolutely super to listen too. A real tear jerker too!
2,"boring, boring CD!","Enrique needs to come up with new material. All his songs sound the same...boring, boring CD!"
1,Unlistenable for rock fans,"I got this as a gift by chance - otherwise I wouldn't deem to listen to this sort of music. But after all I did. For me, a rock fan, it was nearly unlistenable (I went thru it to the end just from the respect I had for the donor). Boring, boring, from the start to the end. I cannot understand the success that Enrique could achieve. Musically, nothing new, untouched with rock history and with current modern trends in music (the effort to rap in one of the tracks is just worth a smile). Commercial bubble gum music for female teens, only pretending emotion while being emotionless. Enrique's vocal is ordinaire, somewhat worn down and weepy. I see the only advantage of Enrique - the handsome face on the cover photo. If you are a principally a rock fan, don't waste your time with this stuff like I did."
3,Half the names are junk.,"I bought this book, because when I was scanning through it and I noticed our daughter's name Aya. No book would ever have that name and I noticed several names that were Arabic/Persian and Finnish/Scandinavian. My husband's Arab, I'm from a strong line of Scandinavian heritage. I thought it the perfect book. However, after going through page by page, I found that a majority were really far fetched and unless names. It was odd that the names that had prononciation, you did need it, but there was none for the ones you did. Based on names, the book is a 1 star dud, but I gave it 3 stars because I liked the worksheets in the front, especially the one that made you think of the intials. Like, if you last name starts with a ""D"", you don't want to name your child ""Bethany Ann"", because your intials would be B.A.D. Something parents probably don't think about."
1,Names to Laugh at,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that said there is no middle ground to this book. You can flip through page after page in this book until you come to a name that you can seriously consider naming a child. I know that some parents want their children to have a unique name, but these names crossed the unique line, and have a catergory all their own! Some examples for girls are: Aidoios, Briseis, Charybdis, Dragomira, Elikapeka, Feechi, Gotilda, Halfrid, Imber, Jagoda, Leucothea, MastanehExamples for boys: Narcissus, Ogaleesha, Protesilaus, Quintavius, Ragnarok, Salmoneus, Teetonka, Upchurch, Volker, Wacian, Xerxes, Ysbaddaden, ZbibniewUnfortunately, almost every name is like that...It sounds like a language from a different planet. If you are into foreign ( as in out of this planet foreign) and want your child to have a gibberish sounding name, you will love this book! If you don't like far out names, you won't want to buy this book."
3,Name fits the Book,"I have come to love this book-for not only does it give you a variety of names-it does not drown you in names as do some of those 100,000+ names books."
5,Personal History,"I am the niece of Janis Kearney. I can not tell you how blessed I was to read this book. In a family so large, it is hard to get everyone's ""story."" It brought tears to my eyes to read my aunt's memories, and through her words get to know a little bit about a grandmother I don't remember and an aunt whose death I can't forget. I hope that efforts like this will be taken up by more individuals, so that the generations that come behind us can benefit from the historian in us all."
3,I did enjoy the story.,"i enjoyed the book, but got a little confused with the jumping back and forth. it wasn't written in chronological order and it was a little difficult to know where she was when she was writing."
5,Ridley is a genius,"Yet again, J Ridley takes the reader on a remarkable journey, guiding you through the maze of factual background without ever letting your hand go. His mastery of the English language and notable training as a barrister make him the best narrator of the century."
4,Extremely well written. A great read!,"I really enjoyed this book. It does a great job of not only painting a portrait of Henry VIII, it also gives the reader a sense of what every day life was like in 16th century England."
5,Jeff,"The product hasn't been put to a test yet, hopefully it never will. Now I have the insurance that protects my expensive electronics from power surges It was pretty straight forward. All jack receptacles were labeled in/out. The power cord was exceptionally long. Now I don't worry when a storm comes even if I'm away from the house."
1,There are better books available.,"In this book, the pronunciation for ""v"" is ""v as in English violet."" I'm not a native speaker, but I was taught that the letter ""v"" sounds similar to the letter ""b."""
3,"Not his best, but interesting","I am a huge fan of Bohjalian's ""Midwives"" and could not wait to read this book. While it is not his best (in my humble opinion) it is certainly worth the time to read it. The sisters' problem with the community is a wonderful statement on the difficulties of being different in today's society. What truelly continues to amaze me is that Bohjalian speaks through a woman's eyes so knowingly, hard to believe it is written by a man."
3,Good environmental theme,"Usually when reading a novel by Chris Bohjalian, I find that I do not want to put it down and I am full of anticipation to get back to it. WATER WITCHES lacks that appeal, in my opinion. The story line is interesting and the theme of both the environmental and economic impact of a ski resort on people's lives is fascinating and timely. However, the character and plot development seemed rather plodding and predictable; the tension and psychological depth seemed to be lacking in this novel. It is worth reading, but just does not read as a gripping process of development like other works by Bohjalian."
4,Water Witches,"a little slow to get into, but very much worth it. Chris Bohjalian knows how to spin a story."
2,Not that good,"I never really got into this book, I could not connect with the characters. It was not a very fast read for me, I was bored with it and just never seemed to get interested. This is the first book that I have read by this author and I think my last."
3,"Ok writing, but no magic.",While reading this book I kept seeing a ghost of the outline of writing this book. I mean it felt really contrived. A paint by numbers take on magic.
5,A Great Novel to Teach,"Chris Bohjalian's Water Witches is an engaging and thought-provoking novel that keeps students interested and nurtures a deep fascination for the art of dowsing. Bohjalian's flair for capturing the heartbeat of small town America is unmatched. Not only did my students enjoy this novel, most of them finished it long before the due date (which is certainly rare). I taught this book in a college level humanities class, but it could easily be adapted to any classroom. In addition, the discussion questions offered in the back of the novel are fabulous springboards for essays and for a more in-depth analysis of some of the key themes present here.A five-star rating for this novel!"
2,Disappointing,"Thought I'd like this book, since I know Vermont, have lived through a similar mountain vs. ski resort conflict in New England and am fascinated by dowsing. BUT - the characters are not well developed; they are unconvincing. Hence, the plot doesnt' work. It's essential to the plot that we believe in the conversion of the main character from ""cynical lawyer"" to environmentalist. This conversion is not believeable. In addition, the writing itself is wooden: heavy-handed metaphor, cliche. The sex scenes, especially the second one, seem irrelevant to the story, too. Not a great book."
3,Disappointed,"While this book starts strong, it loses momentum and leaves you wishing that the end would come soon."
2,Book club,"I began reading this book for the book club I belong to. I was not able to get beyond 25%, according to Kindle. The book just did not catch my attention."
4,Subtle and engaging . . . .,"I'm not interested in expansion of a ski resort and not an environmentalist, so I don't really know why I read this novel, but I'm glad I did. Bohjalian's characters are very well-drawn against the peaceful backdrop of scenic Vermont. Some are strange, some are gentle and even the borderline exploitation of the child is deftly handled. Although repetitive at times, I'm glad I stuck with it. The ending is beautiful."
1,Don't bother,I read books to get away from politics and don't intend to read a preachie book about global warming for pleasure. I can watch tv for that. Save your money on this slow moving book.
4,4.5 star read,"This is a beautiful story. Scottie Winston is a man who is struggling with how his life came to serve corporate greed, how he can lie so easily for his clients' goals. He has become defensive about it, knowing that he isn't being true to himself and not knowing what to do about it. Eventually, he comes to a point where he has to choose between his job and his conscience.The other part of this book that was interesting was the concept of dowsers. I had never heard of them before and I didn't know that there were people who spend their lives looking for water sources for others through a special gift."
2,fox run microwavable steamer,"The worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon.The leafs keep falling off. The center pick-up is so hot you can't lift it after cooking.If you take the center pick-up off first and then use it to pick up it won't lift at all.It stains, and they are not removeable even with a Comet rub.Go back to the drawing board - it's a great idea but very poorly designed.A complete waste of money.Bob McKinley"
4,Good Quality,"This comes with 2 pillow cases. It's not the cheapest, but you do get the quality. They are pretty thick and somewhat heavy for pillowcases. They feel pretty luxurious as well. I bought it in the wine color. It is like red wine. It isn't faded out like the picture. I've washed it a few times and the color hasn't faded. I like it a lot."
2,take your chances,"While I love the smell, when it burns correctly, I get very upset when it will not burn right.it really is too expensive to have to take chances.I'm having that problem right now. I purchased two of them and, the first one is giving me lots of problems.I wonder what the second on will be like."
1,Don't waste your money - doesn't stay lit,"I've had to relight this candle repeatedly because it simply will not stay lit. I've tried leaving the wick longer, cutting it shorter and nothing seems to work. I buy candles to relieve stress, not create it!"
5,True Horror!,"This collection of short stories comes from the vivid imagination of one of the best horror writers in the country. Charlee's work is horrific, extreme and viceral. This is a book you can't put down once you begin, and will give even the most jaded horror reader chills!Warning, this book is _not_ for the faint of heart!"
2,A Mindnumbingly Slow Read.,"I finally got to the end of Dread in the Beast. It took me a mammoth 3 weeks.Dread in the Beast was not at all what I was expecting. Yes, Charlee Jacob is skilled in the use of the language but ultimately, this novel bored the bejeesus out of me. The story jumps around in time between the different characters a lot, which made it difficult to maintain an interest. There probably is a good story in here. Jason Cave and Big Garth Listo were interesting characters at times but ultimately there is just not enough interesting stuff happening in between the long passages of background story.There is some fairly disgusting imagery thrown into the mix, none worse than in the opening sequence, but these scenes are few and far between. The story just seems to be getting interesting when it ends.A disapointment."
3,Not bad but just get a frisbee and a ball,"I purchased this looking for something fun for 5 year old my daughter to throw around w/ her older cousins over the holidays. There's nothing really wrong with this toy but the kids quickly went back to playing with a frisbee and a ball instead. This toy isn't as easy to throw or catch as a frisbee or a ball. It was played with for about 2 minutes but the good old basic ball was used non-stop. I wouldn't recommend spending your $ on this toy, it just isn't as fun or easy to play with as a good old frisbee or ball."
5,The best invention since the Hula Hoop!,"This ""ball"" is a blast - I wish I had invented it! It's easy to throw - easier than a frisbee - and easy and fun to catch. I have played for hours with my special needs 12 yr. old son, way longer than I can usually play with any other toy. We try to see how many times we can fling it before it turns into a ball, and it's always a surprise. Loads of fun for under $10!!"
1,Not worth it!,"My 8 y.o. son had begged me for this toy for months. Finally we bought him one and it is a huge disappointment. I don't know how it received a Parent's Choice Gold Award. What makes the ball go flat is a suction cup inside the ball. When we flatten the ball out, the suction cup doesn't keep it flat long enough to throw it. Without the suction cup working, it's just a ball."
2,don't bother,"This toy is not worth the money. Buy a frisbee and a ball instead. The commerical shows how it magically turns into a ball when its in the air. The box states that this will happen only at random times and the more you play with it, the better it will work. It turns into a ball when it hits the ground usually and our kids lost interest very quickly. A big disapointment!!"
5,"Five stars for only this disc, and fewer the more Francaix discs you buy","If you work through this Hyperion series you end up with a sense that Francaix played with a fairly limited set of musical ideas, but none distinctive enough to say he had a strong style--certainly nothing like Poulenc's or Ibert's or Chabrier's or even Milhaud's. It's nice stuff--light and fun--and this CD of chamber music is a keeper, but I hit bottom with the four CDs in this series and have no further plans to explore Francaix's oeuvre. Francaix is not completely bland, and he is not beneath notice, but ""substantial"" may be overdoing it a bit. I've given all four Hyperion discs a lot of attention and they get neither more nor less interesting over time; they just sort of plateau quickly, and not at the highest desirable level."
4,"Far out, baby!","This book mostly consists of interviews with people discussing their unusual record collections. If that sounds like your bag, here it is. Of course, I dug it."
5,An excellent book for all horse & mystery lovers,This book was such a fun read! I own horses and can relate to the story as our barn was sold to developers. I could not put this book down and finished it in a day. The characters are so real and the writing creates a vivid picture for the reader. I think anyone who enjoys a good mystery and loves horses will be thrilled to own this book!
5,"Totally compelling commanding story, masterfully told","Maple Dale is a totally compelling, commanding story, masterfully told with compassion and deep understanding. Liberally sprinkled with mystery, this story is about gradual change, forgiveness and reconciliation within a family, combined with a unique interpretation of how a soul and body was manifested until with concessions, answers given with love were made known and family healed."
4,Treasure Island,"It was expensive, but we liked it never the less. I really do not like having to write this review."
5,CHRISTMAS PAST AND PRESENT,"I JUST PURCHASED THIS CD IN SEPTEMBER. I COULD NOT PASS UP THE GREAT ONE AT ANY TIME OF THE YEAR. HIS OTHER ALBUMS WERE WERE KNOWN TO ME IN THE EARLY SIXTIES. WHILE ROCK WAS GREAT, HIS ALBUMS LEFT AN IMPRESSION ON ME TO THIS DAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAVING MR. GLEASON AROUND THE FIREPLACE. TO ME ,HE HAS NO EQUAL IN THE INSTRUMENTAL FIELD."
4,Why...,"I bought this movie because it's a Macedonian movie. It's a great movie, inspiring, touching, and brave. Why do Macedonians make sad and depressing movies/songs most of the time??"
4,Killing of a childs mind,"This movie for me was all about the killing of an innocent mind, Young Marko a boy who just needs to have a guide in life is let down by the self important adults in his life.Marko has a talent that could have been used for the betterment of him, instead all he learns is that if you life in a sewer then you better act the part.His teacher only seems to be concerned in what Marko can do for him and little of what he can do for Marko. This is also markedly obvious in how the authority figures that surround Marko have been trained to act like rats in the sewer.Marko Kovacevic gives the performance of his short life."
4,Very good Tap,"This is not my first purchase of an Irwin Tap. I'm a Home Shop Machinist and I use taps of all sizes, the Irwin taps have performed well on several projects."
1,Loreal Hair color,THe product was old. The plastic bottle used to mix ingredients and then administer to hair was cracked. This product was so old that is did NOTHING to my hair. NOTHING! What a waste of time and money. I will never buy hair color from you again.
5,Definetly an ash hair color,"If you want an ash color and no red undertones to your hair whatsoever, THIS product is for you!!! In my case I have naturally black (jet black) hair and lightening my hair requires bleaching. So my hair got to a point where it was horribly bright orange and I used this hair dye and it instantly turned my hair to a dark ash brown color!!! (well, not THAT dark) i know the box says LIGHT ash brown but for an RED UNDERTONE corrector, this is amazing!!! DEFINITELY BUYING THIS AGAIN!!!"
5,Darn good,"Astounding. One of the best books on leadership and achievement that I've ever read...and unlike many other books purporting to be ""about"" the leadership abilities of various U.S. presidents and generals (but which are merely a list and/or description of their victories), Strock makes a careful analysis of TR's philosophy and decisions, bolstered by TR's own extensive, introspective writings on the subject. I fully plan on picking up the other books in this series, such as those on Churchill, Grant and Lee. Highly recommended!"
2,If you like shallow....,"The writer shows a lot of potential, unfortunately, I was never really that interested in what happened to the lead, and only truly fleshed out character, Elizabeth West. Ms. Wolper writes some great one-liners for Elizabeth, but she also proves that even smart talking characters can be shallow and ultimately uninteresting."
2,Cigarette Girl,"I must totally agree with ohmargi in her review of this book. I found myself unable to put this book down, but wondered where it was going. It was quite entertaining to live vicariously through Elizabeth and her girlfriends, but what happened to them in the end was too abrupt. I found the characters lives too choppy, unfinished and I wondered why Elizabeth subjected herself to some of the treatments she received. I was very disappointed with the ending (balloon analogy is quite accurate) and had the feeling I was strung along for nothing. I would pass this book onto my friends, but would not ""highly"" recommend it."
2,She's a Bimbo and Won't Admit It.,"The ""Heroine"" in this book is as much of a bimbo as any of the bleached, silicon spinners in LA. Constantly on the make for sex, she gets irritated at men who won' sleep with her (hello insecurity, constantly needs a man's attention) She uses her ""brains"" to create trite come-ons for the old director who is a poor and over glorified representation of the Late, Great (hooker-hiring) Don Simpson. Carol Wolper's proximity to the ""Hollywood"" lifestyle (she's pals with Gina Gershon, whoo!) is just about all she has to go on. I'd take a whining Bridget Jones over this loser of a book any day.If you've spent anytime in college and can carry on a semblance of intelligent conversation with a man, pass this one up."
2,I'm glad I only got this from the library,I only read half of this book simply because I couldn't get into it. I don't get it. The only thing I remember is the main character was sleeping with a directer or producer type guy while his young girlfriend is in New York and some fancy friends I can't relate. I guess it's an okay book to read if you like that kind of thing. I didn't read the entire book to know how it ends.
1,Why was this book published?,"The Cigarette Girl is a sub par book chock full of banal subject matter and pedestrian writing. You don't care about the characters. You've seen this world of shallow movie biz people before. The book is not funny, moving or even slightly insightful. I was left wondering who the author knew in order to get this empty tale published."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"One of the genre about single career women looking for Mr. Right. Helen Fielding and Jane Green did it lots better. The writing is witty but the characters are shallow. There is no clue about what the title means. The main character, a Hollywood screenwriter, compromises herself too much at the end. Don't bother."
2,and will you respect yourself in the morning?,"Even though Elizabeth says half-way through the book that she will never settle for less than what she wants, i.e., true love (and from the beginning you know she loves her mentor, Jake), ultimately she settles more than anyone. I know the author intended this to be a hip, ""honest"" portrayal of the now woman, and probably believes that Elizabeth isn't settling at all, but what does Elizabeth have at the end? A sometimes affair with a man who seems to sleep with whoever wherever he wants, who is having a child and living with someone else, and who basically is unwilling to acknowledge that Elizabeth means much of anything to him. Boy, sounds great! Without meaning to, the author has just presented me with the best reason of all not to have an affair--it's sleazy!"
2,why did i buy this book?,"Definitely a why-did-i-buy-this (okay, i know, i thought it would be fun), or how-did-this-get-published category book. The same old, same old, same old story: ""Girl desperate for mr. right meets a bunch of jerks."""
1,"Irritating twit, her boyfriends, and their girlfriends.","The description on the book jacket looks promising; the book is not. A shallow sex-crazed airhead and her life and loves in L.A. Her main criteria for a man seems to be one who will sleep with her (and that euphemism is *never* used, it's always the ""f"" word). Men who already have girlfriends are an even bigger draw for this woman, who doesn't care if they leave their girlfriends, just as long as she gets some action on a regular basis. Brand names matter very much to her. Her sense of humor will give you some chuckles, but is not the laugh riot the reviews imply it is. Wolper adequately describes her characters, but unfortunately you quickly come to the conclusion that these are people that you want to avoid at all costs."
4,"Witty, Insightful and Edgy!","Wolper tells it like it is for the smart, career-minded, single women in the 90s who don't like the play the game or play dumb. Keen observations with a firm grasp on the LA lifestyle. I laughed and I indentified!"
1,BORING,"This book was a complete bore. I struggled to finish. If you are a TEENY-BOPPER,okay you might enjoy it. This is worse than a Danielle Steele novel. And especially if you are from L.A. you will hate it. Throughout the entire book the author has to brief you on the ""rare and difficult to understand"" life in Los Angeles... Please. It's a joke.... save your $$$$$!"
3,an additional comment from viewer from NC,"In my first review of this video, I neglected to mention that there is a powerful story here. Despite the movie's shortcomings, which are largely the result that telling it in detail would have made it too long, it is a good story. Each character(Gid, Johnny, and Molly) tell their version of their life together. Dates on screen help the viewer track the chronology as the story unfolds. It's a good buy, especially if you read the book also."
4,FAN OF LARRY MCMURTRY,I enjoyed this movie. It was interesting to see some of the actors in their younger days. I became aware of this movie only recently.
5,Individual D&D...,"I've never been keen on the local D&D; groups, as some, not all, of the people are a little odd. But I love the game setup. The Neverwinter Nights series has been really good and my husband and I love to play the games. At times I prefer the older style of Baldur's Gate, but the 3D style of Neverwinter does allow for more visual detail even if the controls are a bit confusing at times.The game itself keeps with the series and I hope they put out more like this."
3,"Good, but run it on a high end machine","HOTU is a good add-on but on my system (a 1.4G Dell, .75 G mem, 32MB Geforce) it would come to a near standstill in scenes with many NPCs. Try waiting 15 seconds in between responses for conservations, ouch!This was frustrating because, otherwise, the game was quite good."
3,Earn your wings and show them off to your friends! NOT!,"If you're going to play this in the single player game then you have nothing to worry about. It's really fun if you like playing by yourself. :)If you were planning on playing online with your friends and taking the Red Dragon Disciple (a new class that allows the player to become 1/2 dragon and grow a set of wings) then be ready for some heartache. Once you've downloaded the most recent patch, version 1.61, and spent your time (how much is *your* time worth?) building your character up to wing status you'll discover that you can't login because this class is broken! Keep that in mind, before buying this expansion pack for little Jonnie or Janie (or yourself ;) ) if you play online and wanted to ""wow"" everyone with your wings.Everytime a bell rings, someone finds a bug in NWN:HotU!"
1,Do NOT buy this defective expansion pack !!!!,"This game starts out great .. just like the original Neverwinter Nights and the first expansion pack ... Shadows of Undrentide.However, about halfway through the game, the NWMain.exe file startscorrupting and the game freezes and you can NOT go any further in the game. Check out Bioware's technical support website about this game ... thousands of player complaints. Bioware/Atari are aware of these bugs and are doing NOTHING about fixing them. Buy this game only if you want to be VERY disappointed halfwat through the game!"
2,Good Product Bad Software,The Net MD is a really great for listening to music once you get it onto the player. The problem is Sony decided to make getting songs really difficult with their software OpenMG. The program is barely functional on my brand new pc. To make thigs even worse the program has anti-piracy parts in it. Who actually buys a MD player to transfer songs they bought? Anyways if you have any problems with the software don't depend on any support since OpenMG website is closed. OpenMG is the only software you can use to transfer songs. I think you can use realplayer to transfer the songs now too but you can only put mp3s on it. Because of Sony guarding its ATRAC technology so closely they have taken away their user's rights to pick which program they would like to use. Unless you want to spend an hour changing the songs I suggest you don't but this product.
5,Still in the Dark Ages of Vinyl,"So I've read all the reviews, all had excellent points made. Everyone can agree that nothing is without it's own flaws. Horror stories aside, to this day, I have yet to use Open MG (I don't do MP3). Simple Burner in LP2 mode has been quick and painless for me, thanks. In harsh contrast to my touchy CD burner, I do not have any ""coaster"" MDs on my coffee table placed near my ever-growing stack of ""error"" CD-Rs (that took twice as long to burn, I might add). I heavily used ONE 'AA' dry cell battery with the 707 on my recent 2 1/2 week trip thru Europe while everyone else's MP3 and CD players were going silent every other DAY. I have a library of vinyl and mixtapes that I've happily archived to MD with the 707 and couldn't be more thrilled with the results. The car kit and complimentary blank 80min. MD are Godsends as well. Also no drama with the supplied headphones and remote. All in all, I'd buy another one!"
2,Probably real nice - if you're OK with copy barriers,"In a bit of a hurry, I purchased one of these primarily to record digital audio on location using the mic input. The package states support for .wav, and so I expected to be able to copy to my PC and export to .wav or something usable elsewhere. I learned the hard way that it can't be done, or at least they work hard to prevent it. The software locks you into their proprietary anti-copy world, which may be fine if you're a mainstream user (though I really think it's gotta be confusing at first for most). For me its death and now I've gotta return this gorgeous piece of hardware :("
3,Consider This Before You Buy,"I like my Sony MZ-N707 and have always been very pleased with Sony products. I purchased my player a month ago and have enjoyed using it...that is, except for the OpenMG jukebox software. The software is complicated, crashes frequently, and really limits what you can burn. Two hundred and thirty dollars is a lot to pay for a player with beta version software. The player after all is only as good as the software it comes with. I am also dissapointed because Sony hasn't developed any upgrades for the software nor posted any truly helpful information on their website. I have contacted Sony about other jukebox compatibility (such as Musicmatch) and am waiting for a reply...we'll see. To sum my complaint up, if you want a good player then you've found one in the MZ-707 but be prepared for the headache of the OpenMG jukebox."
1,doen't work,"I bought this product (Walkman net md mz-n707 type R) in a shop in Mexico City and it has never worked. At the beginning of every disk the sound is distorted and horrible. After approximately three minutes it sounds O.K.I have tried to find a place to have the walkman fixed but I have not been successful. Could you help me, please?"
4,Great for the money,"I have happily used my MZ-n707 for several years now, either recording my voice lessons/DMA recitals/other performances, or various live performances. I have gotten around the copy protection prohibiting uploading recordings to my computer (and to CD) by recording them into Cakewalk (or some other audio editing program), then converting the files to .wav format.Sony has recently changed its policy, however, with its new models (I just bought a MZ-RH10). If the recordings are made on HD disks--this model is capable of both regular and HD disks-- live recordings can be transferred ONCE and converted immediately to .wav format (or other formats, I believe). If cost is an issue though (this one set me back 250 bones), then stick with the n707!"
2,Don't waste your time!!,"I bought one mzn707 and used it successfully for about 3 months. Then I had to return it because the spring that closes the door to the media window broke! That's right, broke. I was able to get a new one, free of charge, but now the unit does not register with the software. It will not read the disks either. I removed the software and reinstalled, but still it won't read. I have wasted some much time and have been so frustrated with this piece of junk. Never again will I buy a Sony. They constantly put out inferior hardware and buggy software. Don't buy this thing...get one with a hard drive and that has been favorably reviewed."
4,Very Interesting Book,"Being somewhat of a steam engine enthusiast I've always known about the Mallard and its amazing record. I've also had a soft spot in my heart for the Flying Scotsman. This book tells the story of these two steam engines and more, describing the events that took place before, during, and after their construction as well as delving into some of the technical details of the efforts required to set these records. I had never known that there was such competition between Britain and Germany, but after reading the book it makes perfect sense.So read this book, enjoy it, and be amazed that in the 1920s a steam-powered locomotive went 126 MPH."
4,Delightful... if you can get past Shari Lewis rapping,"If you're expecting the Shari Lewis from her earlier Hi Kids! days, steer clear of this CD. Instead of bubbly Lawrence Welk-style arrangements and a 19 year old voice that can't contain its nascent sexuality, you'll find the middle-aged Shari here singing a few pitches lower over synthesized backdrops and a metronomic drum machine. Don't Wake Your Mom is more than the title of a cut, it's the theme of this concept album with five songs, one story (Sleeping Beauty) and trademark Shari Lewis puppet patter. Once you get over the Rip Van Winkle rap, the apparent demise of Wing Ding and the constant boom-whack of sampled snares, you may fall in love with album as we did, drawn towards Shari's vision of suburbia (Track five) where the music from the street outside is coming from a parade and not a car stereo."
3,Wish it stayed just a bit closer to the video.,"I borrowed this from the library, and was just a little disappointed that this was not video to CD. There are a few songs from the video, but they are not completely the same. They are the title song, ""Sleeping Beauty"" (wonderful story by Shari), and ""Rip Van Winkle"" (I absolutely adore this!) But then, there are three new songs that were not on the video. ""Whaddya See?"" (a game in a song), ""Whispercize"" (a sort of exercise song while not making too much noise.) and ""Parade Without a Drum"" (led by the lovable Hush Puppy, but I feel that it is out of place, because they are getting the kids to drum, and not telling them to be quiet so as not to wake mom or ""anybody"".) I was really looking forward to hearing ""One Locomotive"" (or whatever it's called), the song that Shari sings to Lamb Chop to tell time, plus the joke song as well as ""Some of My Best Friends are Notes"" and ""I Am Ready For Today"" being on the CD. Nonetheless, this is a good CD to listen to."
3,"A nice new translation, but nothing spectacular","Remember _The Book of J_, the study of the Old Testament that asserted that the first few books were originally written by a woman? Much of the same spirit can be found here; this is a very original translation of the Bible, an attempt to translate the poetry of the work rather than the literal meaning.Of course, purists won't hold with it, but others might find something to like here. Rosenberg isn't quite good enough as a poet to make it work consistently, but the occasional parts that really click (I like his version of Job) are quite exceptional. His introduction (an essay on the language of the Bible) is also good."
5,"Incredible Story, One of the best books I've ever read.",Amazing account of the Non-Treaty Nez Perce flight to Canada. It took around 24 YEARS to complete. Should be required reading in High School. It reads like a novel and is filled with history.
5,It's honesty is without parallel,"If it wasn't for Mcworter's unwillingness to manipulate ""anthropology"" like the ""father of Anthropology,"" Franz Boaz, we would never have such an honest and compelling narrative of an Aboriginal American's point of view. From Boaz's approach, Yellow Wolf's childhood is equally important. To McWorter, an amateur anthropologist, Yellow Wolf's story IS the important statement. If you are interested in the Aboriginals' story, this is worth your read."
5,Should be required reading,This and Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee should be required reading in all secondary schools in the U.S. The record needs to be set straight.
4,Yellow Wolf: His Own Story,"I am a direct descendant of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce tribe. Old Chief was my great, great, great grandfather. His daugher, Eliza Gale was his daughter, sister of Young Chief and she was my great, great grandmother and Young Chief my great, great uncle. I LOVE reading anything about them and also other books, like Yellow Wolf, written my Virgil McWhorter. He really does the research and puts the information in the most interesting form. He really brings my family history ""alive"" for me when I read his books about Joseph and he does the same in the reading about Yellow Wolf. Thank you"
4,Flembo's review,"I think it will prove to be a great book to use. It seems to be a bit complicated for me to understand. However I am going to the Australian bush next month, and taking my telescope, so I hope to be able to view some great celestial objects and to take some great photographs, using my previous purchase of astrophography, and the Sky Atlas together."
5,Best work for backyard amateur Astronomy,I scanned the book when I got the book first time. Actually it is well prepared and the charts were well chosen according to the need of amateurs.The charts are not glaring when illuminated with a flash light and it is very handy to use in the field as well.It is very comprehensive and clear as the charts were not congested with stars and labeling. Previously I used to use computer softwares in the field but it is always distract the attention out of the objects.But keeping this book beside my head I experienced the true star hopping experience. So I recommend this book to any one who wish not to have disappointing in the field of stars.Also I like to say something about the Amazon.com.They have worked in timely manner. My book was sent with good and very secure packing.They have taken every possible steps to keep the book in safe during the long run to me.Thank you very much Amazon.com.
4,Sky & Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas,Excellent star guide. Its small size makes it very handy to take with you for an evening's viewing of the night sky. I keep it on my desk for when my thoughts drift off to astronomy. I have a telescope that is pointed by hand and this guide is a big help in that regard. Money well spent.
3,Beginner,"It wasn't what I expected. I pretty much wanted a book for dummies on the sky for my fiance's xmas present of a telescope. It's a beautiful book and it has introductions at the front with great illustrations, and if we were to get hardcore into sky charts and all that numbery jazz, I'm sure we'll be glad to have it. But in the meantime, we'll have to have someone help us out with it."
5,Pocket Sky Atlas,"Great maps of sky, works well when outside, i also use it for planning stage before observing, and comes in handy as a quick reference during observing. I use this with my binoculars mostly."
4,"Very good, but with one big exception","I have the S & T's Pocket Sky Atlas in paperback. It's my go to atlas for study and for planning my observations. When I discovered that it was on the Kindle, I decided to buy it. It's very similar to the bound edition, in fact, too similar. I use the Kindle App for iPad, so I can zoom into the pages. The pages aren't high-res, so zooming in gives you a blurry image. Very unfortunate.As far as the atlas itself, it's a valuable, very accessible resource. Easy to use, spiral bound with heavy pages so taking out in the field is great. The constellation boundaries are really defined, objects (Messiers, NGCs, ICs) are clearly labeled."
3,Pocket Sky Atlas on my iPad.,"A useful and very good attempt at reproducing the sky chart. The resolution of the images, however, needs to be improved."
3,"I downloaded this for the Xoom Kindle Ap, not a Kindle","On my Xoom I cannot expand, zoom or magnify the charts. If I could do so, this would be a 5."
1,No night mode for Kindle.,Obviously the paper version of the Pocket Sky Atlas is a great tool based on the many good reviews here. The problem is on the Kindle version there is no night mode...it would have been nice to know before purchasing. The star charts are displayed as an image with a brilliant white background. Not good if you are thinking of using this under the stars.
5,Great atlas,"I saw this Atlas at my local astronomy club's presentation. It's great for beginners and intermediate-level deep-sky observers. I still find it difficult to handle large atlases like Sky Atlas 2000.0 or Uranometria, so this is ideal, and plots enough objects for me. It has pretty detailed charts of the Virgo region. Of course, with a 16"" or 18"" telescope, you will definitely exceed the limiting magnitude of the Atlas, but I think this should be good for a 8"" / 12"" owner or an intermediate / beginner level observer."
2,Not suitable for amateur star gazer,"The charts are very complete, but quite confusing to an amateur star gazer like myself. I should have paid more attention to other reviews that stated the same problem. I think one has to be a PhD or Astronomer to understand the charts."
3,Warning for Kindle and IPad owners. Update.,"I bought the Kindle version and it will not load on the Kindle 2, or the IPad 2 even though I have the latest software upgrade for both. Must be too heavy in graphics.Update - 02-27-13 - This kindle edition was updated so I downloaded it to my Ipad 2 and Kindle 2. It now works just fine on my Ipad 2 but still doesn't work on my Kindle 2."
1,Doesnt load on Kindle Touch,"It doesn't load on the Kindle Touch. I still can't find anywhere where it says this, I fond out the hard way. What good is it if I have to lug around a PC to use the Cloud Reader?"
3,This digital version could be better,"I've owned the print copy of Pocket Sky Atlas for a few years and it's an indispensable astronomy tool. I'm a bit disappointed with this digital version. There's no zoom or enlargement function when using it on my Droid Razr Maxx phone. Using it with the Kindle reader on my Galaxy 10.1 tablet, the zoom function works, but the resolution becomes grainy. Still though, handy to have a copy of this on my tablet but useless on my smartphone."
1,Beware: Does not work with iPad Kindle App,I have the spiral version of this atlas and have found it to be quite handy. I looked forward to having it available on my iPad as well. The description says that it will work with the iPad. Wrong. It does not. I've attempted to get some customer support for this issue. So far no luck. Stick with the spiral version.
1,"Not supported on iPad, Windows 7 and Windows 8","I tried to load this on three different versions of the Kindle application:iPadWindows 7Windows 8 (on a Samsung Slate and a laptop)Not supported on all three. Assume it works on a Kindle device.Refund was easy, but took a little looking around on the Amazon site to figure it how to return a digital order."
2,Not For Your Smart Phone A Work In Progress,Just bought this and I'm afraid I've wasted $10. I have it on my Droid X smartphone and it is very difficult to navigate and the displays are to small. And the menu options are few. I hope they update this with an better interface and more display options. I love my two copies of the printed Pocket Atlas and that will have to remain my source for the time being.
1,DID NOT RECEIVE,HAVE NOT RECEIVED ORDERI would like to receive this order so that I can make a fair evaluation of it.
3,Not for beginners,"This is a very precise atlas, but it is not for beginners or those who don't read the map very well. It's in latitude/longitude terms and diagrams."
2,Confusing!,"I purchased this book based on all the positive reviews. I thought it would be good for a beginner stargazer like me. This book is very confusing. Page after page of dots connected. I'm not sure where to look in the sky, what the constellations are, when to look. Help!! Maybe when I get better at finding constellations I will appreciate this book more, but in the meantime it has me puzzled."
5,Pocket Sky Atlas,"I am a relative newbe to astronomy and have been looking for one book that is small enough to be used in the field yet detailed enough to show me whats up in the sky any time of the year. This book fits that bill to a tee. I especially appreciate the sturdy pages and the wire binding. This is an exceptional book for the money. I was planning on getting a couple of other atlases but after using this for a few nights, I see no need to have anything else."
1,Would not load on Kindle or PC Kindle Reader,I purchased the Kindle version of the Pocket Sky Atlas and it would not load either on my Kindle or PC Kindle Reader. I had no problems with returning it to Amazon and receiving a refund.
1,Unable to open it!!,"Despite having the newest iPad, latest iOS, and the most recent update to the Kindle reader program, I have yet to be able to open this book. The Kindle app keeps telling me it requires an update to view this content. An update that apparently isn't available as yet...."
1,Kindle version won't load to iPad with Retina display,"I have the printed version of this standard reference, and thought that having it on my iPad third generation would be a good addition. Unfortunately, while it will work on my much lower definition screen Kindle Fire, with repeated attempts to download it for my much higher definition iPad, it won't load and as such is....USELESS. Buy this one in print, ONLY!"
1,reader for iPad use not functional,the digital version completely useless due to app not able to be used on iPadNo usable iPad app reader available on scouring web
4,Great breadmaker even with home ground wheat flour,"I have used this breadmaker for about 2 weeks. I grind my own wheat flour and use it half and half with bread flour. So far it has worked very well. I like the horizontal pan. I've read a few comments about some having problems with the paddle not getting all the flour out of the corners. This may be because there is not enough liquid in the dough. If you have had this problem and you are not going to be able to check the dough for moisture during the kneading process, I suggest experimenting with adding a little extra liquid in the beginning. Try adding a tablespoon and then adjust if the bread is not like you prefer."
4,good breadmaker,"User manuel is laid out to give instant (almost) gratification for those of us who can't wait to read everything: Directions for a loaf are almost the first thing to read. Manuel is divided by type of cycle used: basic,express,dough, etc. The machine itself is an attractive shape and easy to use. My only complaint is the pan is a little difficult to remove after the bread bakes. I have worn out two Breadman Pros, and I was ready for a change. I like this machine and would recommend it."
2,caved but good tasting bread,"We bought this machine a couple weeks ago at Bed, Bath and Beyond (wanted a bread machine quickly) and have used it at least 7 times. ALL the loaves collapsed! I called the service line and the woman said, add more yeast (already tried that) and then she ended with, it's not the machine. I can definitely follow directions and I know it is not me. After trying the recipe in the book twice, I've altered the flour, the baking time, the salt, the water, the yeast, etc. and still every time it is a sorry looking collapsed bread that tastes very good. It is such a disappointment.Update: After much experimentation found that reducing the yeast to 3/4 teaspoon prevented the bread from collapsing."
1,Not recommended,"I find it interesting that 0 of 2 people found ""the Doctor""'s review helpful. Do these people just want to be told what they are hoping to hear?My wife and I have had a similar experience with our Oster. We replaced our well-used (and now much missed) breadmaker with this model. To date only 2 or 3 of many, many loaves we've tried to bake have ""remotely resembled bread"". As did the doc, we also tried diligently to bake bread with the Oster, following various recipes, including tried and true favorites. We have been thoroughly disappointed time after time. I strongly discourage purchasing this breadmaker and am now in the market for another unit."
3,it's okay for a rental,"the ending leaves you with the thought of a parallel universe. It was like a time warp and ""what if"" things turned out this way?"
3,NOT truly universal,"This is not a truly universal kit. Purchased this for an Avertec laptop. However, this kit did not work for the laptop."
2,So-so item[...],"I bought the unit to power a Panasonic; it did so, but the connector is not proper for it and falls out easily. Further disappointment is that the final adapter plugs into a master adapter; another point of possible disconnect. The voltage switch could easily be shifted to the wrong setting; it would be better if it was recessed. [...]"
3,italian pop,"1996 was the year of this italian singer, giovanna, who introduces herself to the musical scene with singles like: hasta mañana, tu y yo, and pienso en ti, getting good airplaying success."
3,"Cute pad, serves its purpose.","When I purchased this, I was expecting a more rubbery material, though it is actually a thin foam mat. I bought it to fit under my Pioneer Pet Raindrop fountain, which has a significant splash-over. I later realized that the fountain had a very small volume-adjustment tab on the motor and now I don't really need the mat, but it is very cute and held all the extra water my fountain was splashing out. If it were made of a more rubbery material, it would be easier to clean. The foam seems to hang on to calcium and minerals from our water and doesn't come completely clean when I scrub it."
3,does the job,"Does the job but the best quality material appears in the photo, could improve future product material. thx for the waterfount my cat are very happy."
5,Simple and elegant,"I was looking for a simple, but elegant wall sconce for a very reasonable price (shade is even included). This sconce fit the bill. Exactly what I was looking for. I liked even more once I received the actual product."
3,Not bad but I've had better.,"This is an ok game. I like the fact that I can make my whole party, player by player. the radial menus are ok. the combat is good. I like the turn based type of combat. That way i don't have players just standing there when they are done casting or whatever. Over all I am Happy with my purchase."
2,frustrated as everyone else is,i bought the game awhile back but for me didnt have a problem getting it to work.the control interface couldve been alot better as well as the many many bugs the game has.i uninstalled it and quit playing it because of the bugs as well as didnt agree with the fact you had to go and download all the patches for it as well and it doesnt mean the patches fixed anything.i am a hardcore gamer and i do have patience but with this game it was worn thin.the graphics are ok there are many things to do in the game but the overall bug problem as well as downloading all the patches hurts the game.if you have patience and you have time on your hands to tinker around then all means buy the game.
2,so much unmet potential,"You know that saying ""the whole is greater than the some of its parts""? Well, I feel the oposite is true with this game. It certainly looks very good. It has a very good turn-based fighting system that is easy to use. Stat building and leveling up is handled well. The problem is that these individual elements do not add up to an enjoyable game. It feels rather empty, and due to many bugs (several of which crash the game), I found myself eager to ""get it over with"" so I could play something else.It lacks any meaningful plot and is basically a series of somewhat redundant battles. I got the feeling it was a great starting point for a really good game, but it never really went anywhere. On to KotOR!"
3,The Temple of Elemental Evil,"You will have to be very care with this games requirement. I have a system that meant and double all the requirements. But when I get to the temple port part it would crash. I wrote Atari support and sent my system info, then they wrote back telling me I need a video listed on their recommand requirements. So this game is a lost for me because I am not going the buy a video when I have a top 256mb video that doesn't work with their game. The a joke!!!"
2,More bugs than a termite's nest,"This is such a cool concept that I couldn't wait to play. Sadly, it's completely riddled with bugs. My favorite is when fighting types are penalized for using a weapon they are proficient with. My fighter (8th level, 18 strength, weap focus longsword) has a +8 bonus when it should be +13. Oh and a dwarf I made got the same penalty for using a dwarven waraxe. Come on guys."
2,"I agree, unfinished, unpolished, untested","Most of the crash and instability glitches come in the last third of the game so it presents itself fairly well for at least a couple dozen hours of gameplay.This also tends to leave a positive impression with many people that write reviews before the progress to the end -- they havent experienced the worst yet. Still, having seen the worst, and having spent hours reading the unofficial support forms for answers, I still like this game and await a patch. In good conscience I can not give ToEE a good rating however.If there was a catagory for rating the publisher, ATARI, I would give them ZERO stars because they unprofessionally pushed this product out the door without beta testing it."
1,do not buy this game.,game is unplayable constantly crashes to desktopstill havent heard of a patch to make it run.
1,Doesn't Work,I am puzzled by the high reviews this game gets when it doesn't even work. They put a lot of effort into the gay marriage part. It would have been nice if they had that same enthusiasm with the rest of the product. I have not bought another Atari product since.
1,"Unplayable, Installs But Doesn't Load Game","I installed this on my computer with no problem, but when I attempt to load the game for play, it just temporarily displays a CD icon which then disappears. I searched online for a solution, and came upon an Atari forums thread titled ""Temple of Elemental Evil refuses to start"". Apparently, alot of people cannot even start the game, and Atari hasn't fixed the problem."
2,Great Ideas,"This game has excellent potential. It executes the 3.5 rules nicely, and watching them in visual action provided me with a new respect for the ruleset. Like Icewind Dale 2, you don't have the ability to roam freely and adventure, which is okay, since it is about the temple. Unfortunately, the bugs, even with the patch, are just a little too much. I imagine that it helps if you have a powerful computer system, but from what I've read, it doesn't help much.If you can pick this game up on the cheap, say $10-12, go for it, as long as you can also download the official and unofficial patches. I hope the Atari and Troika make a sequel or expansion with the kinks worked out. A realatively bug-free version would become my second favorite CRPG, if for no other reason than the rules execution."
3,Released Before it was ready,"Okay, first of all, Troika, the developer, said that there was another build of the game that was done right after the gold announcement of the game. To those that don't know what a gold announcement is, it means that the game has been sent to the cd burners and is being prepped up for distribution. The game is good, very expansive, used the 3rd editon rules very well. The combat system, which there you see a lot of, is very well done. So, you wonder why I only give 3 stars instead of 5? The game is very buggy at this time, there have been reports of crashes, quests not being completed, etc.I'd wait a little while before purchasing this game, because it needs a patch or two before it would be perfect."
1,Too buggy to play,"I wanted so badly to like this game. I love D&D and the game at times can be fun, but it is simply unplayable. This is my first ever review on here and I hate that it is a bad one. I would not advise anyone to buy this game. I would say stay away and do not touch when you see it on the shelf. Others have said wait for the patch. I do not even know if that would help. I have had more crashes playing this game for about a week, then I have had in my entire life of using computers. I cannot say it strongly enough, stay away from this game. If there were negative stars I would give them to this game. This game is still in EARLY Beta, unfortunately they released it as such."
2,"If Only It Worked, Sigh...Wait for the Official Patch","The other reviews have covered the situation well.This title has so much potential. The combat system, turn-based, an implementation of D & D rules are a great starting point. The problems, however, far outweigh any joy derived from playing.Most problematic is the fact that game does not work. Many have experienced the game crashing to desktop, locking up, or freezing for over ten minutes (yes, some have apparently waited). After many reloads, my journey through the temple finally became unplayable. No matter what I do, the game crashes.There are numerous bugs, in the rules. In other words, the 3.5 rules did not make it into the game correctly, even differing from how they are described in the comprehensive manual.A patch is on its way. Nevertheless, I would definitely suggest waiting for it and reading the forums at Atari before buying TOEE, to make sure it works. Otherwise, and most unfortunately, it is not worth the investment"
2,"If this game weren't good, it would get a *ZERO* for bugs.","First off: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL A PATCH IS RELEASED. It is nearly unplayable in its current form due to an absolutely insane number of bugs. Check out the forum at www.greyhawkgame.com for a taste. I'm pretty unhappy with Troika and Atari for letting this thing out the door.Anyway, the game itself is more in line with actual AD&D rules than any title I've played recently. I'd compare it more with the old 'gold box' series than Neverwinter Nights. Which is very good. The graphics are great, and I like the return to turn based gameplay. Unfortuneately, I cannot write an in depth review due to the ever-present drop to desktop bug. Had this game shipped without so many bugs, I'd have given it 4, maybe even 5 stars."
2,Full of Bugs,The game looks good and has a very nice user interface system for issuing commands to characters. BUT THE PROGRAM IS FULL OF BUGS AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THIS CONDITION. Don't buy this game until they do something about the bugs.- monsters spawn where you can't reach them and you can't exit that part of the dungeon while there are active monsters. You have to exit the game to actually leave the dungeon and if you saved while trapped ... then you'll have to start over again. Very frustrating.- Ironman mode menu system doesn't work
2,"Good Idea, Poor implementation",If you are considering buying this game I would strongly urge you to hold back on your purchase. This game is laden (not the bin type) with bugs which give you numerous CTD errors. Not to mention that Troika and Atari are now having a lover's spat on who's responsibilty falls where. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your RPG fix.
1,WAIT FOR THE PATCH !!!! Don't waste your money.,Almost unplayable.Both Troika and Atari should be ashamed of themselves.
2,Totally Unbalanced,"Being a D & D fan and seeing a PC game with version 3.5 incorporated, I immediately purchased the game. At first the game seems pretty cool. I had to laugh when the big frog grappled one of my halflings with its tongue and then scooped him into his mouth. However, the encounters are absolutely unbalanced for first level characters. As DM I would never pit first level characters with monsters whose hit dice are twice, triple or quadruple of that of the party. The characters no matter what character class all died as monsters, animals, the undead relentlessly sought and destroyed the party. The party itself inept could not barely hit a thing.I do not recommend playing this game. Laughable at first, but evolves into sheer fustration. Ditch this software game and stick with core rule books and human common sense. In this case paper and dice rule."
1,Disappointed D&D fan,"Man, this game is loaded with so many bugs that I cant recommend it to anyone. While the graphics are beautiful, the constant crashes and game lock ups just make it unplayable. I am glad I didn't pay for this ourtta my own pocket, I'd be really PO'ed if I had. And my PC is the latest from Alienware, with 2Gig of Ram and a 256MB video card, so you'd think this game would run smooth, but nope. Spend your money elsewhere, wait a few months and hope they get the bugs worked out. Oh, the latest patch for this game still hasn't addressed all of the bugs, just additional fyi."
3,"Descent, though with problems","I had no problems running this game and some of the patches help. When it runs, it's fun. The problem I have is it pauses and minimizes the window too many times and I have to pull it back up, or it crashes when I try to close out of the game, causing me to restart my computer. And I've tried it on my Dell PC, Toshiba Sattelite, and Compaq Presario with the same results."
1,Similar to an ant farm,"I've read many of the reviews of this game and notice that everyone keeps saying it's ""buggy"". Well, I wouldn't know about that, as I can't get through the tutorial without getting a massive headache. Why, you ask? The font is too small. I do not know why, but this seems to be a problem that not many reviewers have picked up on.Even in 800 X 600 mode on a 19 inch monitor, you have to sit about one foot away from the screen to read the text clearly. This does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience. Unfortunately, there seems to be a trend toward using barely ledgible font in many new PC games.I must defer any other commentary about the game's ""bugginess"" to the other reviewers. I salute them for being able to play it even for a little while. Nevertheless, I think that a word of warning should go out to any gamers who don't like the idea of duct-taping their heads to the monitor."
4,Excellent Intro. Game,"Bugs aside, this is a really great way to introduce someone to D&D; (without table top).The game itself is heaps of fun, quirky and interesting enough to keep one entertained (absolutely perfect for procrastinating).Note about the bugs:If you're lucky, there will only be a few. You can choose to tolerate them or download a patch. And that can be handled with either the official patch or one provided by Circle of Eight ([...]). I personally recommend the Co8 patches (they fix a lot, and add some new things, if you like).The game now is cheap enough to not worry about the bugs. If you're a very serious gamer, maybe this is too annoying for you, but if you're casual about your games, then this one is definitely worth the [chance of ] glitches (which, I repeat, can be fixed).I recommend the overall plot of the game. It's a lovely adventure. It's engaging, and stimulates your imagination, which of course, is more then half the fun.Check it out, and enjoy!"
5,Several good patches are available now,"The retail version of ToEE has some substantial bugs. It is virtually a requirement to download the patches. Having said that, once the free patches are installed, the game is very good.IMPORTANT: The version 1.1 patch can be found at Atari's web site (www.atari.com). There is also an additional, 3rd party patch available for free from Circle Of Eight (www.co8.org) that has even more bug fixes and adds some features. Unlike the Atari patch, this one is updated frequently to address user reported issues.If you are a fan of D&D and have even a little knowledge of the 3rd edition rules, I think you'll really enjoy it. If you are only familiar with the older 2nd edition rules, you'll probably want to pay extra attention to the manual or review some of the fan sites in order to get the most out of it. If you don't have any experience with D&D at all, I can't say for sure if you will enjoy it or not."
4,Much better after patch,"No doubt, this game NEEDS the official patch. 'Nuf said.After that, artwork is good, implementation of 3.5 rules is excellent and very insightful. NPCs are a bit weak, so make a good party. Fortunately, you have complete control over character generation. Game difficulty at the start can be tough because it's hard to tell which encounters are over your head as a 1st level party and resting is not a gimme - once you're past that, it's better.Radial menu commands and mapping system can be tricky at first. There's a ton of helpful tips you might miss at first that let you hot key popular commands, check for ""clickable"" items, check your path, etc. Yes, for the first time ever, I'd recommend going through a few of the ""Tip of the Days.""If you want a faithful electronic implementation of the latest D&D rules, here it is. If you're new to RPGs, Baldur's Gate II, while older, will be more fun."
2,Highly anticipated....however TONS of BUGS!!!,"Once I heard this was being released, I rushed to purchase it right away. I was rather disappointed with regard to the constant bugs and system crashes...Wait for the patch before purchasing..."
1,Can you say Better Business Bureau?,"This game has soooo many bugs and flaws that all companies involved with its release should be reported to the Better Business Bureau! It's not ethical to release a product that never went through testing. There is no way this product went through testing. Distributors should fine the developing companies for all the costs they've incurred handling returns!! I went against my normal practice of checking ""Amazon customer reviews"" because I saw Atari on the store shelf. Well, I've learned my lesson the hard way. I will never buy another game without checking the on-line reviews. Avoid this product at all costs. Play the ToEE Mod available through Neverwinter Nights instead."
2,Wait for the bargin bin slot on this one...,"Don't get me wrong. I'm not trashing the game. Half of this game was one of the best experiences I've had playing D&D on the pc. The other half was so frustrating that I've decided to stop playing it entirely. Serious bugs all through. Horrible charactor pathfinding, enemies showing up on the other side of walls has me reloading because I can't resolve the battle. Slow camera response (or just poor camera movement) and many many other problems. Unbelievable potential and great fights had me trying to get through the bugs, but in the end I'm just dissapointed. Not worth 50 bucks. Poor form Atari, poor form."
1,Extremely Buggy,"I unfortunately paid for this game, but I at least bought it from a physical store, where it was easy to return. The first game I bought froze during install about 3/4 of the way through. I exchanged it for another one, which froze up about 2/3 of the way through. This is a completely unfinished product which is unacceptable, even for a beta test."
2,take caution...,"i really like the way it looked... but they spent more on the case then on the actual game! at first it was kinda fun... but since i hate a camera 30 ft away from my character.... it got VERY annoying, so i never finnished the game... i'm not saying it's a bad game... i'm just saying that if you don't like a camera 30 feet in the freakin air... you REALLY shouldn't get this game... but for those of you that don't mind that, you would really like this game... it's kinda addicting.... if you can look past the 10 million glitches!if your like me... i would suggest getting a different game... like devil may cry, titan quest, the witcher, oblivion, timeshift, or if your more into games like this... you probably would like dawn of magic or spellforce."
2,It's not fun if you can't play...,"Geez, the only success you can have in this game is exploring the first town! How are you supposed to play if you can't survive? I understand (and am all for) a challenge, but come on..."
2,A great game that might have been,"The Temple of Elemental Evil starts with a good opening sequence and then some impressive graphics, but savor these first few moments of elation because the gameplay is terrible.Characters often cannot find their way around objects, even other members in your own party. In one area I sent the party to an open spot only to have members going all over the place. There were several times that I entered a home in the village and was unable to start a conversation until I moved the entire party around; possible due to movement being blocked.The combat system takes forever to finish, although I did like the area of effect being shown before casting spells.I found the game to be many of the Dungeons and Dragons rules without the imagination or great storylines that were the hallmarks of my D&D experience. After being given the initial ""wow"" of graphics and the original Temple of Elemental Evil as a backdrop I would have expected much more than this product delivered."
1,Interesting game...if it would work,"The game is pretty interesting. I'm not a pen and paper D&D player, so I can't comment on that aspect of the game. But as an avid video gamer, I liked what little of the game I have been able to play. Unfortunately, even with two patches for this game, it still is riddled with bugs and other complications that make the game frustrating and not very fun. I was sorry to have spent the money on it that I did. I could have laid down the same money, or perhaps even less, for a better game that was actually fun to play. The technical difficulties destroyed any chance that this game would be enjoyable. If you're a glutton for technological punishment, buy the game. Otherwise, find something else."
1,DON'T!,"my god, why did I ever installed it? wait a few months and buy it after the first 10 patches comes out, becouse you know what? it doesn't work without it, I'm using PENT4 1G with 512MB mem win XP, sound O.K?, well it's slugish and crash all the time... just wait..."
2,So much potential...,"This game had the potential to be the closest pc game to the original PnP games, however, it has turned into a giant disappointment. Here's why:-completely unfinished dialog-far too many bugs to mention. Basically, a +3 Cloak, which is all you ever know by the vagueness of the description doesn't even give you +3 nor do many other ""bonuses""-the game was rated ""T"" at the last minute which caused the developers to take out many, many things but the remnents of those quests/people remain which leads to unsolvable quests-uses the Arcanum engine which was outdated when Arcanum was released 1-1/2 years ago.Do NOT buy this product unless you want to encourage other software companies to release beta games. This title, while it had been promising, is an utter disappointment."
1,Inexcusable,"The BG games, IWD games, and NWN games were all wonderful near flawless D&D games. I enjoyed each one tremendously but they were all made by the same company.Then came Pool of Radiance, a D&D game by Ubi Soft, and it was a bug filled unplayable pos.And latest is Temple of Evil by Troika and Atari... buggy and almost unplayable like PoR.Didnt they learn anything?This games price has already dropped 1/3 and its very new. It will be a bargain binner like PoR in the near future.If you want a wonderful D&D experience then buy the Baldurs Gate, Icewind, or Neverwinter Nights series. STAY AWAY from Pools of Radiance and Temple of Evil. :("
3,This game is similiar to Baldur's Gate Series...,"...but make sure to get the recent patches for this game. Overall, i like the turn based system of fighting, as this is rarely seen on PC RPG's and is seen more on Console type RPG's(mostly SRPG's). Anyways, the game starts out hard, but gets fun trying to find all the secrets. I recommend getting the circle of Eight mod patch, and also the Fan mod patch as both of these fix problems not found in the third official patch."
1,Wait for the Patch,"This game is unplayable in it's current form...it might be good once they get it out of beta (maybe alpha) testing, but I'm sorry I spent any money on it before it was ready. In the future I intend to stay away from all Atari Products"
2,No Crashes... No gameplay either!!,"I have to agree with the previous review. After the Balder's Gate series (1+2+Throne of Bhaal) and the IceWind Dale set, this game is a disappointment. I have not experienced any crashes on Windows ME, but the bugs are just too frustrating. The scrolling of the screen is too slow. The comments made by the previous reviewer are spot on with regards to graphics, combat and character generation. I only gave 2 stars because the bugs prevent me from seeing more of the game. Anybody reading this should hold out for the patch first. The crashes must be due to Windows XP(extra problems!), but the bugs are very unprofessional for a first release. Come on guys, you cannot even complete first level quests due to bugs... how much beta testing does it take to discover that? Shame on you Atari. I remember TOE from D&D all those years ago, hence the interest. What a shame. Tis a few steps backwards from BG1+2, IWD1+2 and NWN."
4,"ADDICTING FUN, BUT GRAPHICS LEAVE SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED","Honestly, at first I was upset. When you plug it in and start playing you realize right away this game has the graphics of a NES, but when you are using a gun it's so much more fun than a gamepad. Makes the experience. Overall the game was fun but not really a value since a NES with a gun and a hunting game would give you overall the same results. One advantage is that it is plug n' play and can go anywhere. I got it for my dad and he loves it and can figure everything out so it's a winner."
5,absolutely awesome toy,"I bought this for my 6 yr old son bcause he enjoys going to the arcade and paying to play this game. My son, wife and i have a blast trying to outscore each other on on the different levels in this game. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a blast and teach their children the correct way to handle a gun."
1,waste of time,"I bought this toy for my fiancee because he likes to hunt and thought it would be fun to play. The gun would not properly calibrate and through the hunting expeditions we would walk for 20 miles at a time and never see anything. This was a waste of time and money, now I have to pay shipping to send it back."
1,Huntin' 3,My son plugged it in and it worked for about 15 minutes. The quality was not there. My son cut the cords and took it outside.
2,"Got what I paid for, good thing it was half price.",Game was boring hard to use with few instructions it came with. Children get bored very fast with it.
1,PlayTV Huntin' 3,"This game pretty much blows for younger kids because it is impossible to aim. It is too difficult for them to manipulate the scope on target. The graphics are marginally better than the first generation of Pong. While it's better than a day spent at a torture camp, you may feel as if you're being tortured trying to get it to work properly."
1,deer huntin game,My son is 5 and loves hunting and I think this game may be a little to over his head but at the same time the picture quality isn't very good. I think I would most likely not recommend someone buying this toy atleast until there child can read.
5,For Christmas This Year - The lettermen,This is the best christmas album I have purchased in thirty-five years.
4,6-piece bathroom set,Nice product of bathroom accessories at a decent price. I especially like the seashell motif which goes well in a beach theme bathroom.
1,DON'T EVER BUY THIS !,First of all they flat out lied. 12 hours of intense gameplay my but! I beat it in two and a half. A whole arsenal of intense spells. How about 7 or 8 spells. The story made little sense. and the battle was weird. The first of three bosses you fight is harder than the last. and a enemy who you caN't hurt fears him? Don't buy this game. Pitty those at 3DO who spent good time making it
1,Warriors my...,"I bought this thinking it would be like Crusaders, it was similar but warped. You couldn't chose your runes on your weapons for example and the spells were weaker. The enemies were ok, i guess. The worst part is I paid [money] for 2.5 hours of pointless, storyless, crap. Don't waste your money, wait for Crusaders 2 to come out."
4,Good 20.00 game,"This game was good but to short, and even though you did not really need all that much skill to play it, it did offer some interesting challenges. I wouldn't really call it a RPG, it was more like an action game. Other Might and Magic games are more thought out and more complicated, ie.. ""Warriors of Might and Magic"" does NOT have a map or a FLYING spell to get around with. Unlike other M&M PC games that do. Warriors does have some really cool movies that further the plot and are, combined with the game, worth the 20.00. but if you can get it cheaper it would be better."
5,He' s the number one...,"Luis Miguel follow being the best singer of all Latin American Comunity. Fans must be grateful for this CD, it's got a lot of his style and personality. Some songs that are included in this Audio CD are the best of Luis Miguel, including a mix of Romance with songs like "" No Me Platiques Mas / No Se Tu / La Puerta / La Barca / Inolvidable "" and another with Romances: "" Voy A Apagar La Luz / Contigo Aprendi / Por Debajo De La Mesa / El Reloj / Sabor A Mi / La Gloria Eres Tu / Besame Mucho "". Fans: There's more !!!! Two new songs: Y and La Bikina. In this CD Luis Miguel give to us all of himself and he makes to feel us that we were in the concert. Don't lose it!!"
5,LUIS MIGUEL - DER BESTE ALLER LATINOSÄNGER :-)),"auch dieses album von luis miguel hält allen erwartungen stand. ich hatte das glück das concert 2 mal live zusehen, in barcelona und in las vegas, und diese cd versetzt mich zurück in diese wundervollen abende. ich hoffe, dass luis nie aufhören wird, uns mit seiner phantastischen musik zu beglücken:-))"
5,Good Cd.,"We buy this cd, Vivo from Luis Miguel more than one year a go and we like this kind of music."
4,Love Luis miguel,"Plain and simple, this cd came a little banged up (it WAS used though), on the exterior that is, but the CD itself was great, little to no scratches. Got the CD and it played great, loved it . GoHastings is a terrific company and I would order from them again, no issues at all!"
5,The second live album,"The second luis miguel CD, is better than the first one, then again his performance is excellent."
5,Vivo-buy it!,"It is great to be able to hear pop, the best of the Romances songs, and 2 new mariachi recordings all on this one live performance cd! It was recorded live from his Amarte es un placer tour at a concert in Monterrey Mexico. The only thing better than this will be the release of his vhs/dvd of this same concert on Oct 24, which will be 30 minutes longer. WOO HOO! He did good!"
5,IMPRESIONANTE,"Sencillamente genial, creo que refleja fielmente todo aquello que ha pasado en cada uno de sus conciertos de este año. IMPRESIONANTE."
1,buying this was a terrible mistake,"Most of the other reviews posted are too lenient. My problems with the stereo:It felt and looked and operated as though it were shoddily built. The wires when plugged in had to be jiggled often so that the circuits could be closed. The CD player was noisy as the disc spun; it sounded like a window fan blowing. The lights were too bright at the low setting, and the way in which they changed color was annoying. The sound quality was none too good. Setting the alarm was tedious. There was no sleep button. And worst of all, the thing stopped working completely three days ago, which was roughly two weeks after the 90-day warranty expired. I don't think I'll buy anything from Sharper Image again."
1,Not worth your time or money,I still can't believe that they call this a chemistry study guide when it doesn't contain a single chemistry problem. It is just a description of concepts which I don't think are going to be very helpful for anyone studying for a chemistry test. That is is the last time I buy a kindle book without previewing the first chapter ahead of time.
4,Only isolations,"This is an excellent video to learn isolations with lots of exercises at different speeds. The explanations are clear and Sandra demonstrates the movements very well. These include: hip slides, rib cage slides, chest circles, hip drops, vertical figure 8, small hip circles and flat figure 8. However I was disappointed not to see a bonus performance on this DVD."
3,nice,"Sandra is a wonderful dancer, her technique is amazing, and she is a great teacher. I just wish there were more drills on this video."
5,highly recommended,"I bought it after viewing the vedio clip made by one of the reviewers and I thought I liked it. No regret. I have benefited a lot from the teachings. I also like the practice after every explanation. Some teachers keep talking and give very little time for practice; after a while, I get bored. But so far my isolations become better after viewing this DVD.So far my shimmy & figure 8 aren't perfect but I guess they will improve soon after I make use of the teachings."
4,Tony Hawk's Secret Skate park tour,"I origanally bought this movie, because Rodney Mullen was in it. But after i saw this video I was glad i chose it. It introduced me to some awesome skater's like AleX chlamers, and donny barely. Rodney mullen does increadable handstand flips to primo to like a weird backside triple primo flip thing. The extra's are great to. And an added bonus Tony Hawk skweeks when he says destryod. Awesome Movie, still could of used more mullen though."
4,College text,This book was a required read for a Philosophy of Religion class at the University of North Texas in Denton. I believe that it is still an excellent resource and I will have this copy on my bookshelf for the rest of my life.
5,TRUDA IS AMAZING,"MY HUSBAND IS A DESCENDANT OF THE MCCOYS AND HE WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND THIS BOOK ON AMAZON. THE AUTHOR AND FAMILY MEMBER TRUDA, HAS DONE A MARVELOUS JOB PORTRAYING THE FAMILY IN THIS BOOK. I HAVE TO SAY ITS ONE OF THE BEST EVER WRITTEN."
1,Don't Buy It,"Ever plan on falling asleep while listening to this stereo? Then don't buy this one! The power LED in standby will illuminate your entire room and if that isn't bad enough, the main LED display cycles through even brighter lights. Sure, you can press and hold a button to keep it at a particular color but when you turn the stereo off it loses the setting and cycles through the colors again the next time you turn it on. Maybe you could deal with the bright lights if the sound was good. Once again, don't but this one! Even if you can get past the very thin, metallic sound the hiss of the CD player at low volumes is unacceptable. Once again, Sharper Image's quality disappoints me."
4,it's a very good game,the game was cool.The only problem I saw was that you had to shoot each enemy so many times.I think it's a great game to buy and rent.
2,cant find replacement tire,"we bought this bike for my 3 yr old son for his birthday in june. by sept the tire was bald. cannot find replacement tire because it is a china made bike. the tire size is 12 x 2.125. the more common size is 12 1/2 x 2.125. you can buy the 12 1/2 tire and tube all day long at any walmart, kmart, ect. if i woyld have know this before i bought the bike i would have picked out one that had a more common size."
1,Dissapointed,"We got this bike for our 3-year-old as a Christmas gift and weren't able to use it much until the weather got better which is a shame, because I would return it now if I could. Here is why: the training wheels loosen up every time he rides it to the point that they nearly fall off. I literally have to bring a wrench with us in my bag, just in case I need to tighten them while we're out. The right pedal actually came off as he was pedaling and he nearly fell off the bike. It is falling apart around him and we are so, so sad that we chose this bike. Don't get it. It's not worth it. Pay up for a good quality one. This one is cheap and dangerous."
4,Adorable little Bike,This bike was for my 3-year old grandson who loves Spiderman. It was very easy to put together and seems very sturdy.
4,Juju Bike,"My 2 year old grandson was so excited to ride this bike, he learned how to do it in the first 10 minutes."
3,spiderman bicycle,The bicycle is adorable. Too much time in putting the bike together. There were broken parts and no air in the tires.
1,Upset,"I got this bike for my son's birthday. After I opened the package, I found that one of the front stems that hold the front wheel was bent making it impossible to fit the front wheel in between them. Not only that, the bike had rust on the handlebar. I bought a NEW bike not this rusted, scratched, and bent bike. Find another bike! Now I have to scour the stores for something better."
2,poor quality,"The overall quality of this product is poor at best. The finish is good, but the mechanics are horrible. The rims are not concentric to the hubs. Also, the bike is difficult to pedal, as if there is something internal creating additional resistance. The only reason I kept this product is because my son wanted a Spiderman bike."
1,okay but missing some pieces,"One training wheel was missing. Also, the front piece on the bike with the spiderman picture comes off easily. There was a number to call to get parts that didn't come with the bike, but they have been closed for the past ten days. If I get the training wheel, I will change my review to 4 stars, as it was an affordable bike, and my son likes it."
4,A Sturdy toy bike,My son loved it. There is rarely a moment when he is not parading on it. He finds it a little too sturdy at times but enjoys his little toy bike a lot and treats it like a precious possession.
5,Great Buy,"My son would always see this bike in Wal-Mart, so Santa brought him. I found this bike at the best price in Amazon, its sturdy and great for a first timer. We plan to give it a lot more use this coming summer, up to now it has been awesome. I recommend it."
5,Human kicks,Some really great songs in this CD. I've actually had a chance to see INTROVERT live. A must-see show if you're in South Florida... but I'm sure they'll take off in the next few months
4,college conspiracies,"Rebeccasreads recommends MURDER AT THE B-SCHOOL as a thoughtful thriller, although the protagonists are in need of more passion as they tend to talk in lectures. However, Jeffrey Cruikshank does have a way with words, a fine sense of humor, an aptitude for suspense, & has the makings of a mystery writer to watch out for."
2,"Pleasant Diversion, but Not Much More","Jeffrey Cruikshank is a good writer, but in the end I found MURDER AT THE B-SCHOOL to be rather flat. My major problem with the novel is the rather bland characterization. In particular, I found the lead character, Professor Wim Vermeer, to be a remarkably colorless individual. I also found the plot somewhat slow-moving, with very little suspense until the last 50 or so pages.Also, I would not buy this novel if you're interested in the Harvard Business School and its inner workings. This book actually has very little to do with the school or business in general. It is instead a straighforward whodunit that happens to take place at Harvard. Most of the action in this novel takes place off-campus.In the end, I can't recommend this book because I think there are far superior mysteries out there. In particular, I recommend the work of William Kent Krueger, Jacqueline Winspear, and Michael Connelly."
4,Face-paced debut,"Jeffrey Cruikshank's Murder at the B-School is an enjoyable and well paced debut set in the financial and academic worlds.When a wealthy student at Harvard Business School dies under mysterious circumstances, Prof. Wim Vermeer is asked to represent the college and act as liaison with the young man's family.The powerful MacInnes clan, predictably, shuts Vermeer out. But he soon teams up with a captain on the Boston police force to jointly pursue their investigation. The professor's involvement, along with the detective's willingness to accept his participation, are just two holes in the plotFortunately, Cruikshank's characters are interesting, and his descriptions of the internecine battles of academia are well-done. If the story isn't quite as compelling as it could be, at least the author has the skill to keep it moving."
5,"Better than I expected, fascinating reading","When I first picked up the book, I thought it would be pretty dry. I started to read it region by region and got more interested with every page. I love the authors style and candor, very entertaining. It is pretty amazing that the author has survived all of the dangerous places he has written about without at least one nutjob killing him. Hope he survives to write another couple of editions, I'll buy them too."
3,"Some interesting details, too much ranting","RYP, who admittedly is an interesting traveler/journalist, unfortunately mistakes his stamp-laden passport as sufficient qualification to fill 1000+ pages with rants. The first 200 or so pages have brief, interesting chapters on topics like dangerous jobs, diseases, bribes, kidnapping, and other hazards faced by people eager to enter rough locales. The remainder of the book is made up of 15-40 page summaries of about 30 countries, including recent history, political climate, demographics, local dangers, and sources of health care. There are useful tidbits here, but you have to grit your teeth through the long, sarcastic tirades about every political figure and government mentioned. Most if not all of them deserve a hefty amount of criticism (after all, they comprise the leadership of the most dangerous places), but very quickly his writing goes from witty to annoying. Buy an inexpensive used copy, flip through it, then give it to a friend."
1,The book is atrocious,"I actually used this book while travelling overseas. Pelton has exaggerated many things beyond interpretation. When he can't find something wrong with a place, he simply fabricates a story based on urban legend and half truths which anyone can pick up back home. I think he needs to apologise to the people of the countries he has condemned."
3,Not a joking matter,"Obviously a lot of work went into the making of this book, however the author is trying to double as a comedian and it takes away from the intent. I found myself many times asking ""was he kidding about this or serious."" His comic attempts were way overboard, otherwise, excellent research."
3,Paging well read world travelers,Theres simply not a more comprehensive compendium/bible/guidebookavailable to help you research and understand all the hotspots and danger zones in the world today
5,Hysterical and makes one grateful,"On one level, this book is a crackup. It mercilessly skewers the worst places on earth, places that combine poverty, fear, and oppression. I dare you to read a single page without laughing.On another level, this make really makes you think about the huge percentage of the world's population that doesn't have electricity, considers pain to be a second language, and considers a good day one in which you eat. It's incredible.On the day I wrote this review, this edition is being offered for sale for one cent. An amazing bargain, in terms of entertainment per penny."
5,An action-packed and absorbing read,"Pelton delivers an intriguing and frightening perspective. The more I read it, the more I couldn't help noticing how dangerous the world has become. Now I don't want to travel anymore, because, according to Pelton, some of the safest, most hospitable countries, such as Ecuador, are hellish danger zones with land mines, gang warfare and sex offenders. Aside from the obvious gross generalizations he makes, the book is actually pretty laughable and is great reading material for people who are arming themselves for Y2K."
2,"Buy for the humour, not as for a travel guide","This book is long on generalities, cliches, prejudices and tongue in cheek blue-collar humor (the author is a blue collar worker turned adventurer), but short on specifics. Buy this book for the author's comments, but after a while his cliches begin to grate on you.Not a bad sourcebook for identifying the dark underbelly of world travel, but buy a used copy."
5,My Bible,"A wonderful book. And I mean that-truly intriguing. Coskun Aral has once again demonstrated his talent for observation, through words and pictures. This book is truly my bible. It goes everywhere with me. As a student of international relations , I can safely say that this book goes where no government will."
2,Testosteroned rubbish from a braggart blowhard,"Robert Young Pelton fancies himself a modern-day Indiana Jones, and has written a book about what he considers to be the world's most dangerous places. He hits all the hot spots, including Afghanistan, Colombia, Iraq, etc. in his survey. He's done lots of traveling, no doubt, but his writing comes off as macho bragging (of the ""I fought off three guys armed with only chopsticks!"" nature) and his advice on staying safe is pretty common sense (Really? We shouldn't flash large gobs of cash in crowds? Thanks, Pelton!).Pelton himself was captured by armed rebels last year in Panama's Darien Gap and had to be rescued. If he's so savvy about the world's most dangerous places, why did he get himself in that position? If you want to take advice from this guy, be my guest..."
2,Cinical review with a disturbing passivity.,"This book is a good introductory book to world's geography and cultural and political history.The cinical stance towards the crimes and murderous attitudes of governments, regimes and geopolitical forces is more than disturbing.The whole matter is presented in a ""humorous"", ""light"" manner, as if death and murder are part of our everyday life and most of all moral acceptance. As if things are externally imposed (by God?) and we just observe them and live with them.It suggests a passive compliance to events and invites us to indulge our ""bourgeois"" right of tourism with caution, end of story and travel safely.The 2 stars are just for the amount of condensed information about the world's situation."
3,"People who voted for Bill Clinton read books, too!",I wish the author would keep his political views to himself! It does make me wonder how biased much of the writing is overall.
5,ADDICTIVE ADRENALIN RUSH!! MUST HAVE!!,"EXCELLENT WEB SITE LINKS, PHONE NUMBERS, CLUBS, T-SHIRTS, CAPS, FUN JOBS AND A RUSH TO READ!! BUY NOW!!"
5,Let them be judged by their own words.,"Boy they let some wackies on line like the guy below (twice at that!). How does he manage to review two chapters in DP4? A book that hasn't even been written or published yet? He hasn't even read DP3 or he would know that RYP is not a journalist and probably one of the more levelheaded people around. Maybe Mr. South Africa should write his own ""I love South Africa and Israel"" book (and brush up on his crime stats, terrorist incidents as well as spelling and grammer while he does it) DP Rocks!"
4,Live the dangerous life vicariously through this book!,"Whether you choose to visit the places described in this book or not, you'll learn a lot about life in ""The World's Most Dangerous Places."" If you do decide to venture forth to such hell-holes as Afghanistan, Haiti or Sierra Leone, at least you've been forewarned regarding survival techniques. At a minimum, it'll make you feel relatively safe on a New York City subway at 2 am!"
4,"Great book, but I hope his editor gets fired!","This is a fun page turner for anyone interested in knowing all sorts of information about the less traveled places of the world. However, the phenomenal number of typos along with the author's uncanny ability to repeat himself are a bit of a distraction to the reader. The author rarely gives any references to where he gets his facts-- I find it hard to take a book full of statistics & tables at face value when he doesn't even note sources for most information, thereby establishing credibility. On top of all that, some of the data contradicts itself & causes confusion for the reader. But in general, I have enjoyed the book and I reccommend it for anyone who's not afraid to pick up a 1000 page book!"
2,DP Lite,"I hate to say it, but as much as I liked DP3 and DP4, I'm really disappointed with DP5. Most of the info was rehashed from the previous editions, and I'm not going to shell out twenty bucks to read the same thing twice. It seems that as the editions keep going, it's getting lamer in both visuals and text, as if the publishers made the author tone down (""dumb down"" is a more appropriate phrase) the material to make it more mass-marketable. Not to mention that DP5 is designed more poorly than the previous editions, making it a little more difficult to distinguish the sub-chapters of each country. I think I'll borrow a copy of DP5 out of the library and photocopy the new countries and stories and add it to my well-worn edition of DP4.Yes, there are some new countries and some new stories, but overall, ""the shoes ain't worth the shine...,"" as the old saying goes. Severely disappointed, RYP, severely disappointed. It's as if all the new found fame has gone to his head and not into the book."
5,Great,"I recently finished reading the 5th Edition of DP, and was amazed. Pelton's travel tips offer a wealth of uncommon ""common sense"" and his tongue-in-cheek humour, rather than make light of the difficulties and suffering experienced by people in warzones, adds a strange touch of realism and illustrates the true absurdity of some situations. A must read for anybody traveling outside of the first world, or any of those folks who are afraid to leave the house in Canada or the United States."
4,RYP and Co. got a lot of guts,"I've found RYP's Dangerous Places guides to be an invaluable resource for concise information not easily found in once place and as such was very much looking forward to the latest edition of the series. Its not everything I had hoped. Though I'm sure collecting the information; traveling to these hot spots, is a long and arduous process, I had hoped for a completely new set of ""dangerous places."" But what we do get is still some of the most facinating, witty, and harrowing recounts of the world's forbidden regions. RYP makes the trip so you don't have to. All in all well worth the read, even if you've already read the previous edition cover to cover as I did. I'll do no less with this most recent addition to the series."
5,an enjoyable read,"Pelton gives who, what and whens of the location in discussion. A must read for anyone suffering from wanderlust. Could be a good book for those that question the validity of the media"
4,The World's Most Dangerous Places (5th Edition) by Robert Young Pelton,"I bought this book as a gift for a friend who owns an older copy, a copy printed before 09-11-2001. He loves the new edition, my friend has not put the book down since I gave it to him on Christmas. I look forward to reading ""The World's Most Dangerous Places"" myself."
5,Excellent Reference,Trying to keep up with what is going on in the world today? Use this book as a an excellent reference. It will inform and amuse you about the different cultures and tastes around the world.
1,I'd rather have poison ivy than watch this movie,"I was forced to sit through this movie; yes Alyssa is attractive and it's allright to see her half naked but being that she is one step down from a porn star - everyone has already seen that, so yes I was expecting her to be her normal trampy self again but you would think the movie would do something else to keep an audience interested.Instead you go scene to scene waiting for her to undress or if you're like me waiting to see the credits roll as the plot is girl comes to town; has sex with the first guy she meets, reads some old diary notes, then decides to become a homewrecker, then finds her morals, married guy who thought he was going to get some gets pi$$ed and tries to kill her.This movie was just downright awful and I still have nightmares from viewing it."
4,I NEED A COLD SHOWER,"I first saw this movie when i was a toung teen and didn't really put much thought into it; BUT I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD!!! ...Now that i'm alot older I find that I am still quite taken by the movie. This sexy ,""bad girl"" movie is even more overpowering then it was brfoe ..."
1,Please,"Alyssa... Please... Ava Savealot. That describes this movie. Most of the people who like this movie are under the age of 15, and are waiting for puberty.Don't waste your money.... Call 1-800-collect..."
1,The first time I actually booed my television...,"This movie was so awful, I found myself actually booing my television during the bogus ""child in jeopardy"" scene at the end. I didn't see the original, but I hope Drew Barrymore was better than anyone in this dreadful waste of time."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"The original is by far the best since it has an actual plot and some decent acting. The second one should not even be in this group and is only watchable due to Alyssa Milano; the quick ending on this movie is just proposterous. The third one is more of a thriller and follows along the storyline of the first, but I felt like I was watching a porn movie (i.e., don't recommend watching with the family!)."
3,Poison Ivy II - A Masterpiece of Modern Cinema!!,If I knew that I'd be watching Samantha Micelli naked on DVD when I was 7 years old I would definitely NOT believe it. But it's true and this DVD is worth every cent you pay for that reason alone. I've seen all of the installments in the Poison Ivy Series and the 1st and 3rd aren't as entertaining as this one. Of course this one is utter crap also but in comparison to the other's it's way more enjoyable. But I'm partial to Alyssa Milano over Drew Barrymore and Jamie Pressly. It's just a matter of taste in women because let's face it - no one's watching this for it's cinematography or unique vision.
2,"Cheap, sexy B movie","Alyssa Milano is fine as Lily, a girl who wants to be just like Drew Barrymore's Ivy. Cheap and low key but very kinky"
3,Poison Ivy/Poison Ivy 2:Lily/Poison Ivy:The New Seduction,"These are grade B movies - interesting, but not inspiring. I consider them second-rate movies! Acting in these movies was so-so!"
4,good not great,I loved the first one. That bieng said the second one is good if you dont think of it as a sequel but as its own film it dosent follow story lines of the past its not the same set up but as its own movie it does pretty damn good.
4,about the movie Poison Ivy II,"the sex scene and story in this movie is much better than the first poison Ivy and the posion Ivy new seduction productions. What I can say about the three Poison Ivy is that the plot is different in each of them and for the part II, the diary belongs to lily's sister, Ivy but it looks like a coincidence that lily happens to grab her diary at a unknown private house....well it is a story anyway but you can treat it as if this diary belongs to someone else that she reads and later made herself looks 'seductive' that even the painterr himself(lecturer) could even get himself killed as he could not resist the temptation of her beauty when she appears around the last part of the story. A good collection and purchase for this particular movie. I rate the story as 4 stars and the sex scene as 4 stars."
4,Alyssa Milano=Acting,"Yes, friends Alyssa Milano can really act. I thinkit is in her blood, although she seems to be betterin dark dramas such as this or Embrace of the Vampire where she was terrific. I have the UR version which has some choice sex scenes with Alyssa and she is very good in all of them especially the closet scene when she drags her young lover into the closet at a party. She alsohas a split personality which I do not quite understand why or how she got it. But for fansof Alyssa am recommending you add this one to yourcollection."
2,"Great Alyssa, but rather boring movie","This is a chick flick masquerading as an erotic thriller. A rather sappy love story is the center of the movie and there's very little suspense. The only reedeming feature is Alyssa Milano's performance as Lily. She's really good and I must admit her nude scenes are also very sexy.The DVD contains no extras. It would have been interesting to have included interviews and behind the scenes.All in all, a movie for Alyssa Milano fans only."
3,First year college student finds bizarre diary.,"For those of you NR affacionados, this movie does not deserve its NR rating. Embrace of the Vampire is better movie for that purpose. Otherwise, Poison Ivy 2 is good B movie. Alyssa Milano's acting is OK, but who watches her for her acting? The acting from her boyfriend co-star is actually pretty good.Actually, the acting from all of her co-stars are better, although some are marginally better actors(such as her art professor) than Alyssa."
5,the movie was sexy and riveting,this movie is a definite must see. alyssa milano is excellent as she acts out the secret desires in the diary. it was highly exciting and i think the guy she co stars with is hot!! they make this movie worth seeing.
3,Alyssa Milano,"This a video that Alyssa Milano made sometime after her TV days as Samantha on Who's the Boss, she only did one video/movie as far as anyone knows, it isn't the greatest movie, but it's not the worst either, it all has to do with her body getting possessed by a spirit etc., it is not meant for the family movie night, it is very adult situated."
1,Poison Ivy 2 is Disappointing!,"Bad Plot, No back story, Un-relatable Characters, Sickening setting!If you have Poison Ivy 1, Skip this collection order The New Seduction separately!"
3,Alyssa Milano - I love you!,"Bought this dvd specifically for Lily: Poison Ivy 2. Alyssa Milano is amazing! A few decent shots of her beautiful breasts in here, but nothing too magnificent. Poison Ivy 3 with Jaime Prestley's not too bad. But Poison Ivy 1 with Drew Barrymore sucks. Nothin to look at!"
4,Forget the hype -- a respectable drama,"I've no idea why PI2 is packaged as a sequel to the Gilbert/Barrymore ""Poison Ivy"". Lily (the Milano character) is no teen murderess, nor is she a premeditated homewrecker. The story is sexy, but not gratuitously so. Both Alyssa Milano and several others turn in competent performances. Cheryl Ladd was particularly notable in her role as the invalid wife. Milano, of course, is stunning. She's sexy enough, thank you -- but mostly she's just oh-wow, girl-next-door pretty."
2,"Unrated ""No Nudity""","The movie was a good thriller, if you are looking for Nudity, the Unrated version could easily have passed for PG. Get ""Embrace of the Vampire"" if you want good nude sceens of Alyssa Milano."
1,Alysa Milano exposed,"NR, more like PG-13. This film may have a couple of good scenes for those Alysa Milano fans. But nothing more than just really softcore stuff. If your a guy, Don't get this for your collection. It only has just like 5 minutes of very mild action, total."
3,Overrated,"A lot of people I know have recommended this game to me, because I love computer games and play tons of other RPGs, but I have to say I was really dissapointed. I only played until I was level 13 or so, but I found the game slow and uninteresting the whole way through. First off, I'm not really a fan of the D&D rules or whatever...for some reason none of the RPGs I've played with them have really caught my interest (except Knights of the Old Republic). I can see why people like the game, but I personally don't enjoy it. It also has great modablity, which is a big plus, altough I don't think it's enough to save the game."
2,Overwhelming,"All right, I've tried to get into this one about as much as a fan of the Forgotten Realms can, but, I just don't like it. Here's why: the game is overwhelmingly cluttered with... stuff! Normally, I'd never knock that in such a title. Morrowind, Warcraft, and some other older turned based titles had as much, if not more ""stuff"" to contend with while playing. Yet, Neverwinter lacks something in its delivery. There were too many times where I got disoriented by some column or building crossing between my character and my eyes that resulted in some minor attack catching me entirely off guard. The ability to modify/personalize your character and his equipment is too limited. Interactions between you and NPCs are frequently tedious and unrewarding. And for those who claim that the expansion packs or tool sets make-up for these frustrations; please note that I didn't give the game 1-star. Oh yeah, the music wasn't that bad either."
2,Fans of BGII may be dissapointed.,"As a huge fan of Baldur's Gate II, I was expecting a lot more from this game. The party system is not at all like BGII. There are no romances or banter to be found, unless you engage in the online play. That, in and of itself, was the most dissapointing aspect of this game. The rest of the game was ok. The graphics are pretty nice, a little cumbersome at times. The plot is fairly interesting, perhaps a bit too easy for some. The game also offers a starting level to help train the new player on the various controls and console. Overall though, it just got really boring without the ingame banter/romances/mods that BGII had."
4,RPG geeks only,"If you are looking for a good RPG experience, then I would reccomend World of Warcraft instead. This game is fun, but is has the 'raw' feeling of an easily hackable game. This is because they include the developement package that they themselves used to create the the game. That's not only bad, though. It's also fun to create your own story and share it online with other NWN players. Great multiplayer aspect too. If this is your first RPG, choose something else."
1,Blaaah,"It's not the follow-on to BG2 that I expected. I had high expectations for a game from bioware and I was truly disappointed. Having just one character under full control, and a second barely under control, isn't as much fun."
3,read it,Read it and passed it on. Take what you want from the book and pass it to someone who would enjoy it too.
1,disappointed,"I bought the book , knowing it was that the title was old, however the book pages were brown and smelled old. I will have to copy the book and read as the smell is way to strong for me to sit and read. Disappointed in the condition."
1,Boring Nonsense,"If you wanna read a book about how Academia and Research are at odds, ok you may wanna bore yourself to sleep with this awful book that restates the same 2 points in every chapter and is way too long.I think the author just wanted to toot his horn.Avoid this one, unless you are forced into for school or something. Even worse, it was hardback, I paid extra to fall asleep in style."
4,Pleased!,"Though they may not be mistaken for the real deal, they are cute, affordable, and arrived just as expected. I'm thoroughly satisfied."
1,WARNING!!!,"The Amazon UPC code is wrong. Order this item and you will instead receive the SCH1 which requires a ""Sirius ready"" radio.January 2010 update - The picture has been changed to show the SCH1 but the product description is still incorrect. The item pictured is not the SRH2000 home receiver."
1,You will not receive the correct item if you order this.,You will receive the sirius connect home tuner not the srh2000. Amazon needs to fix this problem.
5,Excellent Add-on,This Sirius SCH1 Connect Tuner has made a great difference in my radio listening. As a Sirius customer I was able to add this to my account but the ease of use is also great!
1,Never again,"I ended up buying two antennas for this, and an adapter that I really had problems finding, certain stores said they were not allowed to sell them. So, finally got everything, and could not get it to work (of course I'm in Alaska, service is sketchy from SE AK probably) except for my living room with the antenna out on the porch and the receiver on the floor. So, now I have a hunk of junk I spent good money on, and nowhere to use it. Wasn't too happy about the subscription I had from the internet either. Personally, I think it's a waste of money. I found way better advertisement-free radio online."
4,Sirius receiver,"Not quite what I thought I was buying, but it works just fine. I attribute the slight error to my misjudgement. We did have to order supplemental parts to hook it up to the radio."
5,My favorite of O'Brien's books!,"Despite its formidable size and small print, I raced through this book in a few days of fascinated reading, and was very sorry to see it end. I cried, I laughed; I was intensely absorbed in the life of this ""little person"", Rose. O'Brien writes of Rose's inner state with an intensity and penetration that I don't recall ever meeting elsewhere in literature except, perhaps, as another reviewer mentions, in Dostoyevsky. I think this is very great writing in service to a great and noble subject. If you are more than half awake spiritually this book will rattle you right to your bones"
1,Nothing like his others,"I have read most of O'Brien's other novels and found them riveting. Reading this one was like watching paint dry. I never could finish it. It just seemed to be going nowhere (and I made it at least 2/3 of the way through- I generally don't give up on books easily, especially I've enjoyed the author in other books)."
2,Very disappointed!,"Apparently no one proofread this book before publishing. There are numerous misspellings, words left out or misused, and the syntax is completely off. Also, words or phrases were too often repeated, taking away from the book's creativity. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, and I regret having paid the ""used book"" price for it.I met the Dave Clark Five several times in the Sixties and was looking forward to a good read, but will now try to sell it and get some of my money back."
1,Doesn't work,"We received this software bundled with a D-Link web cam and have had no success using it despite repeated e-mails to technical support. They have basically told us that the servers it was set up with no longer exist, but have not given us a new one. Therefore it is impossible to connect to the Internet Directory to ""chat"" with other users."
1,Not very well made,The retractable cord gets hung up every time. If this is a feature you desire then don't buy this mixer.
4,Black Uhuru,"This colection shows the best of reggae in that period, a lot of famous songs and bands are here. If you like reggae, you must have it in your collection. 4 cds, with 14 songs each, including Melodians, Jacob Miller, Culture, Joe Higgs, Rita Mrley, Lee Perry, The Scientists and a lot of bands that you will know if you really like reggae. This boxed set ignores reggae's big three (Marley, Tosh and Cliff) in favor of presenting some of the best classic sounds of the period....makes for a well-balanced collection. A good choice!"
5,It was quicker than first mentioned.....,"I needed this book quickly and was surprised that it arrived earlier than quoted. I would recommend as well as, order from this person again."
5,One of the best I've read,"I read this book for my sociology class. It was the best I've read. The stories of these kids are so involving and twisted that you wonder if this is book is fiction. This gives such insight to the problems of todays juveniles and how the court system fails them repeatedly and how the kids fail themself. Truly sad and yet reminding us how cold life can be and how fortunate some of us actually are relative to these kids. Although you can read this book in a few hours, it's still worth having on your shelf. This book is part indictment of the system and part spotlight on the troubles ahead for us all if it's not corrected."
5,Reminds me of Hill Street Blues--with kids,"This book is fast-paced, eye-opening and so very well written that I just couldn't put it down. Edward Humes takes you on a marvelous, often maddening, trip inside the secret world of juvenile court. In another writer's hands, this could have been a dull story. But No Matter How Loud I Shout swept me up from the very first page. To me, the best part is the real life characters who make up the eclectic cast of kid criminals, cops, lawyers, judges and hapless parents. The author weaves their stories together in an amazing book that reads like a novel, yet unfortunately is all too real."
5,Must Read For Troubled Youth,It is a book that every school aged child should read. Should be a mandatory reading for those first entering middle school. A book that gives you a good glimpse in what it is like to be juvenile who is in trouble with the law.
5,Exceptional and Insightful,"This is an exceptionally insightful book looking into the juvenile criminal justice system in L.A. It does a good job of illustrating the perspectives of all individuals involved, from ""criminals"" to ""officials"" and also shows gradients of right and wrong, and just how complicated and even faulty the system may be. It is very well written, and I highly recommend it."
4,Eye Opener,I read this book for my Juvenile Justice Class. It is an excellent book on the insides of the juvenile justice system. It was disheartening to learn how the system works and how the children are shuffled through. I highly recommend it. I also recommend Monster: An autobiography of an LA Gang Member
3,"good look, bad scent",this air freshener was the perfect gift for my hubby but unfortunately the product description didn't say what it smelled like. i bought it anyway hoping it would be a subtle scent like vanilla or something equally unoffensive. it is in fact cinnamon scented. this would be fine if my hubby liked cinnamon but he actually can't stand anything cinnamon that isn't edible. it still looks great though and will forever live in the plastic.
5,I had searched everywhere for this.,"I had searched everywhere for this album and couldn't seem to find it unless I paid over $25 for it. After I ordered it I got a confirmation from the seller within 24 hours of when it would be sent. When I received it, I was very happy. It was in new packaging and there were no defects on the cd or in the music."
4,Black Sabbath,This is a good DVD if you are looking to get started on conquering some Black Sabbath riffs and licks. Step by Step breakdown discusses the styles and approach with technique of Tommy Iommi.
2,Not for capacitive touch screens,"I recently got this insert for my Lamy quad-pen and to my disappointment this insert is mired in the past of resistive touch screen PDAs. It will not work with the latest android phones, iPhones, iPads, and most android tablets. It does work on some of the older Archos branded tablets that have resistive touch screens."
3,Not as good as other stride rite shoes,I always buy stride rite shoes as they seem to hold up better than most and fit my daughter well. This particular shoe seemed to fall apart quicker than normal wear and tear. I was not as happy with it as some of the other stride rite shoes I have purchased.
5,Excellent shoes,This is a wonderful shoe. My four children all have flat feet and the orthopedic doctor recommended Stride Rites. This is an excellent price for very good shoes!
3,why no mention of gail davis,"The video quality is about what you can expect from source material from this era, but I enjoy the old tv shows from my childhood. But just one question for Amazon, why do you list the two supporting actors and leave out the star GAIL DAVIES?"
2,not as expected,"I just tried this product for the first time today with my kids (much cheaper on ToysRUs website). The wand makes a huge continuous bubble, as pictured on similar products, but as soon as it is released from the wand, it pops. No bubbles to chase = no fun!"
5,"Mega Bubbles... good stuff, relaxing, fun, good excercise..","Mega Bubbles... good stuff, relaxing, fun, good excercise.. Out of all the bubble making options I have tried - this is my favorits"
2,Magic the Gathering this is NOT,"MTG Players take heed, this is not MTG, but is Mortal Combat with MTG themes and words. If you are looking for an online MTG (similar to the one offered for Win95/98 a few years ago) this ain't it. Save your money.If you want Mortal Combat and a few hours of frustration, this is the game for you."
3,MTG- in name only,"I love Magic the gathering, which is why I bought this. If you play MTG, you will probably not like this. It is semi-original game play, kind of fun, but monotonous at best. I despise the whole 'mana crystal' thing, and also the creatures all respawn after they attack your opponent. No phases, everything you have ever learned about MTG, is now null and void. If I had never played MTG, I would prolly still not like this game, but since it has some original gameplay action going on, I still gave it a 3. And there are only 70 spells total, not 350+ (Below)Pass it."
2,A Real Review...,"I had played the demo version of this game when it came out. It needs a very fast system, and even then, it can take a long time to load. The rules are moderately complex, and it requires the player to focus on many different aspects at once - your mana count, the creatures coming to attack you, your spell book, power up bonuses and the enemy wizard. The graphics were decent, and cool at times. It takes a while to get used to it, and even then you might move your character in the wrong direction. Magic is a complicated game, and it was hell for the programmers who originally made the AI that plays.The spells 'come to life' to give it more action, and less strategy, and make it less complicated. Seriously, you (the wizard) can block or deal one damage. If I was playing MTG (the card game) and I got attacked by a 1/1 I can't say, I smacked it dead. We all want to see the epic wars / duels we play come to life, but without sacrificing the game."
4,Just As They Said...,Simple camera case...no frills. Case appears to be of good quality and substantial enough to protect the camera from every-day bumps and dings. I would recommed it.
4,Canon PSC-80 case,I love this case. I wish it was just a little larger. Hits my camera's on button whenever I'm entering the camera
2,Make sure you get the right case . . .,"Ordered one of these cases for the A400 and was sent a Leather Soft Case 80 (B0002YE6GS). There is a sticker on it stating that this is the PSC80, but it is not. Good deal if you want the Leather Case because it is more expensive than this item, but not if you want a tight fitting case. Having to send back and now I won't have for Christmas."
4,Be careful with how you use it...,"The case is quite snug, and is great for protecting your camera. One of the problems is actually a design quirk of the A460. It is very easy to inadvertantly turn on the camera when removing it from the case. Depending on the mode, this can cause the camera to attempt to extend the lens. It can't, and you get a message on the LCD. As delicate as electronic gear can be, the last thing I want is for something like this to happen. The way you deal with this is to either make sure the camera is always in review mode when you put it in the bag or put the camera in such that the power button goes in first. Not really even a complaint, but something that you should be aware of."
4,"great fit, great look","made for the A400 and A410, this case is a snug fit; doesn't look/feel as bulky as some third-party 'one size fits all' productsthere is a belt loop at the back, and the case itself is aesthetically pleasing.one problem i had with it, though ( and this is minor);a hook for a strap would have been very welcomeother than that, this case is perfect"
3,Camera Case,The case works well except that the width is a little snug. I store batteries in the bottom to use if I am out of the house.
1,un happy,this sink would have bin a nice sink for the money but when i opened the box today it was in like twelve peaces so pore packaging and shippers that have no respect for others ill never by anything fragile again from amazon
5,amazing and affordable,"This product was just what I was looking for. An underwater housing that enables you to use all the functions of the camera, underwater. The pictures I got of my family in the pool have been simply amazing. And since the A95 has a video setting, I was able to grab cool videos as well.out of the box. simply remove the rubber seal, lightly but completely cover the seal with sealant. put it back on. place your camera inside and lock it up. Done.Note:Test the case before you go sticking it in water with the camera inside. Get a 5 gallon bucket, dunk the empty case, and see if there is any water in th e case. If there is. Repeat the seal process."
1,Buyer beware!,"Be very careful before buying this product!! The track listing associated with this product (e.g. Departure, Future Now, etc.) IS NOT what you will get. The only thing that matches is the album cover. This IS NOT the same Pleasure as ""Dust Yourself Off,"" etc. I am very disappointed in the transaction and the seller who obviously either misrepresents the product or has no idea what they are selling. I am just glad I did not pay more than seven and change for it! PS I would have put ZERO stars on the review but it won't let you!"
1,In agreement,"I should have paid closer attention to ""buyer aware"" before I bought this CD. I'm a victim and this listing should be removed immediatly! I've been looking for ""Thoughts of Old Flames"" on CD for a long time and thought that's what I got. Nope, got the techno CD instead! The guys who used this name could get sued and I hope they do because there's only one PLEASURE band from the 70's I know and this ain't it. Don't get it twisted, keep searching and it shall be found. If this listing's still up, I will update and tell you the real deal later. Gone!"
1,Don't Buy!!! Don't Buy!!! Don't Buy!!!,"This is not the funk/Jazz band from Oregon (Bouncy Lady, Glide etc etc)... you''ll be disappointed and out of money buying this garbage unless you like techno. Poorly described item...you might think that Amazon would look into this: NOT!!!!"
1,Torneko:The Last Hope,"Why? Why was this ever made? You immediadetly know there's something wrong with a game, when it's graphics are worse than those of the original Nintendo. Torneko is a boring and tedious dungeon crawler, with randomly generated enemies, items, and weapons. This is a huge problem since sometimes i had gone with only several enemies and all items that i needed, other times i had armies of enemies and very little items, in which i had no chance of winning from the begining. To win you don't need skill, just luck. The story is too simple and the main character is a fat middle aged guy. There are many beutiful RPGs with engrossing gameplay and graphics, on the market. You don't need this game for whatever reason."
1,*stunned silence*,"I wouldn't give this game a second glance if it had a sign saying it was cased along with $1,000,000. Garbage."
3,Good writing but preachy,"Well-plotted mystery with a dark mood and plenty of red herrings. A child is found dead, possibly a suicide, though McKenna suspects murder. One thing is certain, the young boy was sexually assaulted though the folks at the children's reformatory claim that he was sexually active and provoking.I would give this a higher rating except the Taylor's writing gets preachy implying that social workers don't care a tinker's whatever about abused children. She also perpetuates the myth that gays are pedophiles, peddling the worst homophobic claptrap.It's well-written and I will give her another chance, but there are several places in this book when her ill-informed polemics made me want to throw it across the room."
5,A MYSTERY IN WALES,"I have read and enjoyed mrs Taylor's second book. It was good to read more about the main characters, the policemen with out a clue, and the town's people who are naturally reticent and believe it is their duty to keep the police in the dark. I will watch for more episodes to come, as I hope she does not stop now. I especially love the descriptions of the Welsh country and city life."
5,SWARM,"Just a quick note--- I read this collection years ago, but every now and again I go back and read ""Swarm"" again. It's one of my favorite stories, ever.Not only is it funny and horrifying in equal measure, but it raises questions about the value of intelligence in the universe (in a very stylish and self-assured way)that inevitably lead to questions about Supreme Intelligence: our conceptions of G-D or God or gods, which then lead to questions about our God-appointed right to rule over (and ruin? and kill?) our planet due to the quality and (self) importance of our oversized brain boxes, that I've turned over in my mind every few months since I first read it.How many short stories have that power? For me, no other than ""Swarm"" has had that effect on me.I've repurchased this book, just to give it away, and will probably do so again.The other stories are fine as well; ""Spider Rose"" is an especial hoot!"
3,Great toy for son post Halloween party,It really helped pep up the pirate outfit I bought...which still needed a hat. The head piece needs more hair locks or at least a head covering to mimic hair.
5,Great Pirate Gear for kids,This is a great Pirate accessories set for kids.My 3 years old son loves these.All the things are in the right size for three or four years old kids.They are also very durable.
4,Made a great Halloween costume,"We purchased this pirate gear for our oldest son's Halloween costume in 2007. The accessories were great -- he really liked the compass, cutlass and pirate rings.He wore the costume a couple more times after Halloween just for fun. He still has the compass, which we use with our Mattel Matchbox 360 Pop-Up Pirate Island (see my Amazon review).Does your child want to be a pirate this Halloween? The Jack Sparrow pirate gear is a great choice -- inexpensive, loaded with accesories and very durable."
5,a gorgeous book,"If you like salt box and colonial homes, this is a beautiful book full of color photos and floor plans of some of the prettiest homes one has ever seen from a long bygone era. Perfect to give someone who wants to restore an old home or build one of their own. The book is worth it just for the photos. I highly recommend it."
2,Too short,I enjoyed very much and it was amazing but i was very disappointed on how short it was i mean i beat it in half an hour it was very good storyline though but jeez the it could of been a little longer i do not recommend it for people that want to enjoy a long game
4,"Easy fun,no violence.","Got it for my 5 year old son to play on his DS Lite. Arrived on time , in good condition. He plays it a lot and prefers it to other Nintendo games like PacMan or Galaga or MarioKart. Its simple, more fun and easier to understand I guess."
4,Classic Tom & Jerry,"Good game! Difficult to stay away from Tom, so practice, practice for my 4 1/2 yr old daughter. But she is a huge fan so she'll hang in there."
2,Not the greatest but cute...,My son loves Tom and Jerry but this game isn't very fun. It took me a little bit to even figure out what we were suppose to be doing....kinda dissapointing!
5,T & J fan,This DS game was well received. The lil gamer is a Tom & Jerry fan. I like purchasing games that are just good clean fun. My 6 1/2 year old loves it.
5,great game - loads of laughs,My 4 year old loves this game - laughs all round. Simple enough for my 4 year old but my 9 year old loves it too. Find myself stuck on it sometimes - haha.
3,Tom & Jerry DS game...,"I'm glad these characters are still around! And my 5 y/o daughter says this game is gooder than her My Little Pony DS game. So there you go, nuff said."
3,tom and jerry,"This is the review from my 8 yr. old son...""I like this game because if you have a hard time playing the game can help you. It's different from the cartoon but you can make your own adventure. It's a lot of fun!!!"""
1,What a disappointment!,"I had high hopes for this book, because the description sounded so intriguing. They're wonderful songs, and the combination of music analysis and critical theory is right up my alley. Well, the music analysis is incompetent -- not pedestrian, but positively amateurish. The critical theory is trite and superficial, feeling as if it had been cut and pasted from an introductory textbook. Cambridge has produced some great books, but this one is embarrassing."
4,Great Book,This book is great for helping with your own piano. Our player is so old that people don't have any idea or parts to fix it. This book gives us some ideas on how to do it ourselves.
5,Didn't miss a beat.....,Have had an interesting time redoing our player - great addition to our library - helpful and informative directions for my 'handy' husband! We'll see!!
2,Average mirror with poor quality,"The mirror is fine and does a good job showing the blind spots. But it was delivered with scratches on it, that makes it quite blurry. The issue is with the poor packing by the manufacturer which makes the mirror prone to scratches.Pros : Low cost, Delivers what it saysCons : Poor packing results in scratches"
3,It works,It does what it's suppose to do. This can scratch easily. I bought two and both came with scratches on the mirror.
5,Great and cheap blind spot mirrors,"I've been using those for over 5 years and I used to buy them from Wall-greens. They don't take much room on your side mirror and withstand heat, cold, car wash, dirt without any issues. Strongly recommended."
1,Poor packaging ruined product,"The original packaging for this mirror is too big and they didn't bother protecting the mirror's surface. So when it arrived although the package was still sealed the front of the mirror was scratched to the point of being useless, probably just from the mirror rolling around inside the packaging. Even though it only cost about $5 I'm still going to send it back and demand a refund.Guys, spend an extra penny or two and put some plastic film over the mirror or something to protect it, will ya?"
4,Useful for driver side,"The convex shape takes a bit to get used to, but once you have gained an understand where the actual cars car and the position it shows up in the mirror, it acts as a great security for making lane changes. This is strictly speaking from the driver side. From the passenger side, I would say the mirror extends my blind spot vision by about 30% more. But I've found it still quite difficult trying to spot any cars in my blind spot with the cars appearing as small dates in the convex mirror. I'd definitely recommended this product for the driver side at ~$2 per unit but I'm on the cusp of whether $2 is worth the so-so vision on the passenger side."
1,very poor adhesive,"Packing was not good and its adhesive was very weak. Mirror fell down after 3-4 days, very disappointed with this product."
3,Good if they stay on,"I have two on my truck, they work great and you can adjust them anyway you want them, however both mirrors came off due to heat. I live in Northern California so I am questioning how will they perform in other states with real heat waves. Anyway I was lucky enough to find both on my drive way, so I just super glue them and so far they have stayed attached."
1,poor quality,"I bought a couple, one for each mirror. I opened the package and saw what a cheap item it is. It was scratched and all plastic. The mirror is some kind of plastic finish. It was so cheap that it was not worth returning. I'm stuck with this dud of a purchase. Bad purchase."
5,No more blind spots,"I bought these after seeing a similar pair on my roommate's car. They're easy to put on (you just peel off the backing and stick them right on), and seem to stay put. I've only had them about a week, but it's been raining fairly hard and they seem to be sticking quite well. The real test will be if they make it through the winter. As far as additional visibility goes - I have no blind spots anymore, which makes changing lanes on the highway a lot less scary. :-)"
3,Okay but too small to give a wide field of view,"This review is for the 2"" round version. I tried this one and the ""CIPA 49702 2-1/2"" x 3-3/4"" HotSpots Stick-On Convex Wedge"". On the side view mirror of a Toyota Camry, the wedge gave a much wider field of view while only taking up about half the space on the side view mirror. With the wedge I could still use the original side view mirror for looking at things that were farther back, and I could use the wedge to look at things almost directly to the side. The smaller round mirror did not display as much of the blind spot."
4,Typical of TFC - nearly perfect,"When this album first was released in the UK about a year ago, I couldn't wait for the domestic release. I splurged on the import, as I'm a big TFC fan. I wasn't disappointed.In typical fashion, TFC has made another album full of beautiful, power pop. The one star I dock it for is that (surprisingly), Norman's songs are to me, the weakest on album. However, Gerry and Ray make up for it with some of their best stuff to date - and that's saying no small thing.Now that the album is available domestically, there really is no excuse to not get this wonderful album."
4,In the Jingle Jangle Morning,"I don't know about the spelling, but those are lyrics from Bob Dylan's Mr. Tambourine man. This group have nothing to do with Bob Dylan. They do, however, have a sounds which contains elements of the late sixites group The Byrds, like the jangly guitars vocal harmonies. The songs are mostly relaxed, upbeat and cheerul. I would rate this.Random Lyric: Happiness is all I need, the truth is never guaranteed"
4,4 stars for TFC!,"actually, the album hasn't yet reached Philippine soil - or if ever it has, only a select few have it in their possession. I don't have it myself but the mere fact that it's a teenage fanclub album makes it worth, at least, 4 stars."
4,Howdy'll do for me,"Unlike the previous two Fanclub albums, this one fails to jump out and grab you at first listen. Give it a few spins, though, and it easily beats both ""Bandwagonesque"" and ""Thirteen"". Gerry Love goes from strength to strength, and ""I Need Direction"" must rate as one of the very best ever TFC songs. Ray McGinley's songwriting (although perhaps not his singing) improve with every album, and due to a slightly below par selection from Norman Blake on this release, McGinley takes runner-up spot to Love for the first time. Still, Blake's ""If I Never See You Again"" is one of the most gorgeous things they've ever committed to plastic. So, it's not ""Grand Prix"" or ""Songs From Northern Britain"", but then what is?Spend time with this album - it'll keep you company for years to come."
5,Thoughts on this book,Mr Petter is a well respected contributor to the field of Reiki pratice. He has done a great amout of source research into Dr. Usui and the way he practiced and taught Reiki. This is an excellent resource for anyone who is wanting to step up their Reiki practice. I will be recommending it to all my students.
1,Very Interesting.....,"Since Dr. Mikao Usui (the founder of Reiki) DID NOT leave anything in writing, it is very interesting that a book should bear his alleged teachings. His teachings were oral, only written words by Dr. Mikao Usui were the Five Reiki Principles. Don't be misled."
1,NOT WHAT IT PROMISED TO BE,"I am sorry to say but this book is really not worth the money. I read it fast as there is very little substance to it (the print is also on the small side, making it hard to read!). I believe this book sells because of the title--it sounds like it is going to be and offer much more. It is also not well written at all. This book basically gives a whole bunch of hand positions and photographs of the positions. I was very disappointed with this book."
3,Think before you buy,"While this book is a great reference for hand placement, it doesn't cover any of the symbols and their meanings leaving the novice almost lost. There are many books out there with more information that cost less. This isn't to say that this book is bad or anything. Dr. Mikao Usui is well respected by the community and there is good reason for that. I just wanted people to know about this before they buy."
1,I GAVE IT AWAY,It was not what I expected so I gave it to a friend who is actually a Reiki practitioner and she likes it very much.
4,Alternative to Standard Reiki,"I thought this was in interesting take on Reiki, good as an addition to Reiki class and books on western Reiki."
5,An excellent reference guide,I recomend for all Reiki students. It is a excellent information book from Dr. Usui practices!
4,Good but a bit thin on the old Practical Information Side,"I am a recently attuned Reiki Master, and found this book very helpful as far as hand positions go, but take note! he only puts in the hand positions for the Unusual or Very Severe Maladies (ie. those you are (hopefully) never gonna have a chance to run into!). I was also hoping to find a little bit more about the techniques that Usui used while treating - recently the myth that Reiki is solely applied by the laying-on of hands has been exploded - he used tech's such as rubbing, tapping and Funky Things such as the 'Laser-Eyes Technique', and using the breath to heal. There was, disappointingly however, only a page or two's mention of these methods, briefly explaining what they are, with no real instruction as to how to do them. As to the rest though, what was there was excellent - but please - A BIT MORE NEXT TIME?!"
2,Tabs are easily breakable.,"I am just rating the magazine and not the CPM-E3. The tabs that hold the batteries are VERY, VERY weak and will snap off very easily; so be very gentle when inserting and removing batteries. It will still work with broken tabs once you close it into the CPM-E3 but the batteries will not be held in place prior to closing. You would have to hold it in your hand and the case will align the batteries in place."
2,"Nice product, but poor plastic in retention tabs","I have had my CPM-E3 8 AA cell battery tray for about 2 years or more now and tonight just noticed one battery retention tab was broken and upon further inspection, two more are ready to break as well. This does not affect the performance of the pack with inserted into the case, but causes an inconvenience as batteries simply fall out if you turn the tray over. I always used the hole on the bottom to push a battery out with my finger--so it must be poor quality plasic--or not enough plastic on these inner tabs. The four on the outside appear to be a bit thicker. I suspect an injection mold issue and Canon should correct this. On the other hand, once inserted in the case, I have no problems. I am not sure I would buy another as I don't shoot enough flash to warrant another tray, and this one still works fine with broken tabs. If the plastic was more robust, I'd give this part 5 stars."
2,Ditto,"""The tabs that hold the batteries are VERY, VERY weak and will snap off very easily; so be very gentle when inserting and removing batteries.""I ditto this. For thirty-two bucks, Cannon should make a more stable magazine. Those using these magazines are probably event photographers who use one or more of these gadgets on a regular basis. I'm very careful with my equipment, but it didn't take much for the little tabs to snap off."
1,Wrong product!,"They tell you tha this product holds 6AA batteries, and works with the 20D's battery grip, but when I received the item it is for a completely different product and DOES NOT WORK with the 20D's BG-E2 grip. It has the product name of CPM-E3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 AAA batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the BG-E2."
1,Unbelievably booooooooring!!!!!!!!!!!,"If I gave this book one star it's because the option of NEGATIVE STARS is not available. This is the first Susan Johnson book I have read and if they are all like this one...it will be the last. There is no romance, no love and no ""HARD TO GET."" This book was HORRIBLE! Zena has no pride, no self esteem and no...NOTHING. She is madly in love with a JERK who shows no feelings except for sexual desire. If it helps you, I am a HUGE Johanna Lindsey, Connie Mason and Judith McNaught fan and this book is NOTHING like those authors."
2,Want to get to the erotic stuff??!! Then read!,"5 star for erotic, 1 star for characters ! OK! I forced myself to read it waiting for the EROTIC scene promised by the readers. & I'M SO GLAD I DID... It is ...wow... wow..As for the characters, well I hated Sasha's attitude (The male hero), all high & mighty, sleeping around even after knowing Zena (The heroin). & I hated Zena's attitude: ""I can't stand up for myself or say what I feel"" attitude!ANYWAY.... if you start reading & can't continue whatsoever, just skim through the story till you get to page 201 & read!& there is another scene which is also ... wow...page 340 skim, read & enjoy."
1,I HATE IT!,"I Hate It! A woman is molested by a powerful man, who goes to bed with several more women before the book is through. There is no semblence of a loving relationship. The heroine is sold into slavery, raped( and it was rape) and abused emotionally by her jerk husband. The book was erotic, but in a bad way. Why on earth would anyone want to read about anyone being treated this way? Garbage. It may be erotica, but it is not romance. Don't be fooled."
1,I feel like throwing it away,"I really didn't like this book. I loved Susan Johnson's other books such as Brazen, Taboo, Pure Sin and Outlaw, but I seriously hate this one and Wicked. The book had a plot, sure, but there really wasn't much to the love between the 2 characters...in fact, I would say their relationship is solely based on lust."
4,"Romantic, erotic and full of adventure",I thought this book was one of her best. It had everything a lover of romance could want in one book. Zena has always been one of my favorite females characters. I scan the shelves at the book store for Susan Johnson's books whenever I go. The scene when Zena is for sale is very erotic and one not to be missed. Read any and all Susan Johnson books you can find
3,Its is an alright read,"This book is turly not one of the better romance novels that I have read. I honestly can say that I did not like the hero at all, and could tell from early on that he was a jerk, and could not understand why the heroine of the book, Zena could not see all of his poor qualities. I also felt that the hero, Alex's, realization that he did in fact love Zena was a little forced and overzealous for my taste, the fact that he could do a complete 180 in his personality in under 5 seconds is unbelievable. The only charecter that I did find the least bit intriquing was Wolf. For a better romance novel set in Russia read Splendor by Brenda Joyce."
5,Very Very Hot,The plotline between Zena and Alexander goes from hot to scorching. I thought it was basically a change from your regular romances. I loved how they go back & forth. The scenes & history were very researched adding a bit of reality with a bit of fantasy. I would not recommend this book for the mild mannered romance reader. I have read it 5 or 6 times and will probally read it several more times. This one is a keeper!
1,I Hated It More!,"How can anyone think the scene where Zena was being sold waserotic? ............................. The hero, Alex, was a self-centered, oversexed jerk. I did not see how he came to love the Zena. The only thing he appeared to like was having sex with her. Other than that, he did not even want to be around her if he wasn't having sex with her."
3,Disapointed,"Before reading this book I read the reviews and said what the heck let me give it a chance. I liked the fact that the Hero didnt do a complete 360 when he meets the Heroine, however disliked/detested the manner in which he kept treatinig her. I HATED how he kept calling her child. He treated her so disrepectfuly that I hoped that she would cheat on him with another man. I absolutley hated how she was raped by the 2 turkish men in the book and we are expected to believe that the heroine actually Liked it. I was so disgusted by that part in the book that I skimmed it. I was going to give this book 2 stars but it gets three for the the HOTTTTTTTTTTTT sex scenes between the Hero and Heroine."
4,"Not your normal ""romance""","I thought it was a good book because it didn't have the male turning into a ""whipped"" moron in the end. I mean if the man lived his whole life getting what he wanted and bedding who he wanted, why would he all of a sudden change? Wouldn't he struggle with it? I found it refreshing that for once the main hero of the book said to hell with the herion and went along doing what he did best. She was too clingy and he wasn't ready yet. I liked that he knew he felt something for her but didn't want to give in to it. Wonderful book and not your mother's romance novel!"
2,From Back Cover,"Desperate to avoid a loathsome match, Zena Turku ran from the glittering ballroom into a snowy night - and threw herself on the mercy of a darkly handsome stranger. He was her only hope of escape, her one guarantee of safe passage to her home in the Caucasus Mountains. But Prince Alexander Kuzan mistook the alluring redhead for a lady of the evening, the perfect plaything to relieve the boredom of his country journey. Only after her exquisite innocence was revealed did the most notorious rake in St. Petersburg realize that his delicious game of seduction had turned into a conquest of his heart."
1,I hated it also!,"In total agreement with the others that hated it. There is absolutely NO LOVE HERE! It's all based on lust! Both characters are stupid and are definately NOT in love. Don't waste your time on this one! The plot even reeks! This is the first and only Johnson I have ever read and most definately the very last! I traded it in for a better author, you should too. Better yet, don't even waste the time or money getting it, you'll be glad you didn't."
1,Horrible Trash,"If you like reading about heroines that enjoy being raped, sex slaves, infidelity and orgies, than this is the book for you. I was so disgusted I LITERALLY threw this one in the trash. Not even worthy of one star.Horrible writing, horrible, horrible horrible!!! Susan Johnson should be embarrassed by this garbage!!"
3,Steamy but not very romantic!,"This is not one of the 'good' SJ books. It was written a long time ago, and is quite like the romances published in the early eighties where the hero was perpetually unfaithful to the heroine and the heroine was docile and obedient.The sex scenes were quite ok, though quite brief compared to her later novels. This was not a book I enjoyed a lot, primarily because of the arrogant and cruel hero."
1,Where's The Romance?,"This SJ book was quite disappointing. Susan Johnson writes beautifully, but in this novel, there's no romance. Sasha is hot-headed, like most men in novels, but the way he treats Zena is horrific. Zena is made out to be some meek, who can't speak up about the way she's being treated.Why, oh why would anyone think a human being getting ""sold"" would be romantic?Who thinks rape is romantic?Who thinks being treated like less than decent is romantic?This hasn't kept me from reading other SJ novels, though. BRAZEN by far is my favorite. This one is a little on the egde (and I don't mind that IF IT'S ROMANTIC).I'm not going to say, ""Don't go out and buy this book,"" you make your own decisions. But if your a romance nut like me, this one isn't for you."
1,Not worth a penny,"I love Ms. J style of writing, romance and sex in one, but this was the worse book she has ever written. I bought Love Storm, but dislike it so much that I threw it away. The most sickin part about this book was when Ms. J made a rape scene appear to be anything but rape. I agreed with the other reviewers who thought that part should never be in this book. Most of the books she writes I love, because I find Ms J pushes the level of eroticism but when you add rape I think that is too far. But I still love her writing style and will continue to buy her books."
3,What happened to challenge?,"The story was nice but i wish that zina had stronger character. I read BRAZEN and i really loved it, the characters were strong and presented constant challange for each other and Brazen didn't tolerate any mistreatment from Hazard. I think it's more interesting if there is challange and fights of wills between the characters."
2,Much Smaller Than I Anticipated,"It was much smaller than I anticipated, really sized for a cat or toy breed. I bought it for larger dog, and had to send it back, so I can't really comment on its performance. It was light, but once filled with water, that probably won't be a problem. I have found that you really need pictures of products next to pets in order to judge their real size. Otherwise, it looked as advertised and I had no problems with the order, so it gets 2 stars"
4,Nothing special...,"Not mechanically outstanding or amazing...but it does the job. I must warn you, it does not limit the amount your cat/cats imbibe so gorging is a possibility for those of you who monitor and/or feed your felines the ""correct"" amount based on their size, age and weight but for a two to four day excursion away from your pets, this is an excellent buy for an excellent value!"
4,Pet product,"The product is sturdy and easy to clean. I hope it will last for a long time. The only problem I've found, is that if you don't have a good hold on the bottom, when picking up, you can knock the top loose and food will spill out. So, always have a good hold on the bottom:)"
2,good feeder,"Unfortunately, I was looking for a mechanical, automatic feeder and the description of this did not properly indicate it was not. I cannot let my cat have total access to her food so this was not for me. But, I gave it to someone whose cats can use it and it supplements the mice nicely."
2,Worried about Microban,"Please be careful with products used for food or water that have microban. If you decide to get this product or something like it, please make sure to observe the user carefully. I recently bought a food storage container with microban, I washed it out first before using it, put the food in and poured some for my cat. A few minutes after eating she vomited. She never vomits so my first thought was that the microban was the cause, but I decided to wait a day to see what happened. Sure enough, after every time she ate, she vomited. I bought more food, washed her bowl out and tried that. She didn't vomit again. She might just be very sensitive, but please take this into consideration."
1,GET OUT THE DUCK TAPE,"Garbage. Plastic hook and tab construction. Flimsy. Rex knocks it apart. Expect a big mess of cat fud on de floor. After cleaning it up and reconstructing a few times I duck taped it together. But ""Remember it's only temporary. Unless it works."" - Red Green."
4,Works okay.,"Works fine. Container has a tendency to wobble a little bit, doesn't stay together if tipped over. A little tape is a good fix for this."
1,food doesn't come out into the bowl,I don't like this product because the food does not come down into the feeding bowl as it's used. It just stays up under the canister. My cat completely knocks the thing over so he can get his food out and then the food goes everywhere.
1,what you see is not what you get,"Unlike the photo attached to this item, you will only get one of the feeders shown; the one for dry food. I had to order the water feeder separately and pay additional shipping."
1,"Bad product, don't bother","I thought I was buying the automatic feeder which is battery powered. This one,however, it not the one I wanted and would only work if your pet did not overeat."
1,absolutely a waste of money,after reading reviews on different pet feeders I though I could not go wrong on the petmate LeBistro 5lb feeder. WAS I EVER WRONG. no matter what i did it would gush the entire contents of the 5lb water unit down thru the dish and all over my floor. there appears to be no suction to control the water flow. maybe it was just my bad luck but i will not order again! Think twice..is the price that good when it doesn't work?
2,not for big dogs,"I bought this when my Rottie was 2 months old. That was 5 months ago. It was in storage all along and I dragged it out recently. Sufficit to say after all the food was consumed in what I believe was one sitting, it became a chew toy."
3,Would rather use something else,"When I bought this yogurt starter, I bought it in conjunction with the yogurt maker, which I have come to love. The starter, on the other hand, I suggest using not as the box calls for. Instead, you don't allow the milk to boil when you create the yogurt, and make sure that the yogurt culture is really dissolved when you mix it... I like the cultures okay, but I find that buying stonyfield plain organic yogurt and mixing a half a cup of that with the milk does the same thing."
5,Best yogurt starter,"I love homemade yogurt when made with this starter. It is relatively foolproof with an inexpensive yogurt maker, and really delicious--much more delicate and fresh tasting than what you buy in the store. It sets up well and provides a good base for added fruit and honey for a healthy, nutritious and satisfying breakfast or lunch. One packet of starter is added to a batch of warmed milk, per your yogurt maker's directions, stirred and left for the required length of time--about 6 to 8 hours. That's all there is to it. The finished yogurt lasts well in the refrigerator and can also be drained through cheesecloth for a denser, Greek-style yogurt. I'm told the quality of the yogurt depends on the starter and this is the only kind I'll use."
1,doesn't work.,"My yogurt smelled like yogurt, but it was runny like milk. I followed the directions closely. Boiled my milk, wait for it to cool down, at the specified temperature I added the yogurt starter. I used the thermometer provided with the EuroCuisine yogurt making machine. Everything should have worked out fine, but it didn't. This yogurt starter just doesn't work.I have a lot of success using just plain yogurt from Walmart as my starter, and it's a lot cheaper too."
3,Not enough character,"It tastes much like the Dannon Plain yogurt , so kind of bland- I prefer it a little more on the sour side."
5,Wonderful,This yogurt starter worked very well. The directions on the packet were very easy to follow. The packets were a little difficult to open but other than that the product is great.
5,"Great Product, Use it All the Time","I use this product every week to make yogurt and I have never had a bad batch yet. It is easy to use, easy to follow and seems to be fool proof when using this with the Euro Cuisine Yogurt machine."
4,GIRMI YOGURT STARTER,Works like a charm...everything it should be...but pricy. I'll get my yogurt going and then use the yogurt as it's own starter.
4,Works well,Good product for starting yogurt. I have used with soy milk and had good results. Just don't expect it to be thick like the yogurts with gums and starches added.
2,overpriced powdered milk,"Well, the good news is, it does what it's supposed to, making yogurt thicken to the consistency we tend to like it. The bad news is, it's not much more than just simply super expensive powdered milk. I remember long ago when dry milk was a staple that was given out at food banks, etc., and was a super cheap commodity. Now, it's hard to find and extremely costly, but at least you get a lot of it when you do buy a box of it. This starter is teeny tiny and makes one batch, more than doubling the cost of the yogurt. Next time around, I tried a little gelatin, and it worked exactly the same way."
3,Girmi Yogut Starter Packets,Bought a yogurt maker for my daughter for Christmas and figured I should get these starter packages to go with it.
3,Review of Yogurt Starter,The product arrived on time and in good shape. I haven't tried this product yet but am confident it will be what I expected.
4,Perfect thick yogurt,"I have the Euro Cuisine yogurt maker and have used store bought natural yogurt as a starter, but the results were not always as thick as I would have liked, however, when I used this product, I got thick, beautiful, tangy yogurt.My only problem with it is if you freeze it then defrost it, the defrosted yogurt is as runny as water and using it as a starter left my fresh yogurt runny too.I'd rather keep buying culture than deal with runny yogurt.3/26/2012 UPDATE: I'm starting to find it too expensive to buy the yogurt starters. I found a nice alternative in Dannon Oikos Greek Yogurt - plain. It's 1 dollar at our local walmart (cheaper if you have a coupon) and works just as well. Just make sure to use a stick blender to distribute the store bought yogurt culture evenly through your homemade product. It does yield a yogurt with more whey, so I like to strain the end product a little through cheesecloth to get a thicker, firmer yogurt."
5,Girmi R152 yogurt starter,"I love this product. I use milk straight from grass fed cows and was very curious as to the consistency the yogurt would have. As expected, the first batch seemed to be a little granular, but the subsequent batches are perfectly smooth and have the good old yogurt taste I remember from my childhood in Europe."
1,Contains sucrose,"Just be forewarned, this product contains sucrose. I didn't realize this and so had to end up throwing it away after I received it."
3,Should have been better,"I am a big fan - from all the way back to the John Mayall and Peter Green days. And I am a drummer. I don't regret the purchase but think it could easily have been much better. First there was no explanation of the Go Your Own Way drum pattern. Big oversight. Then there was nothing on practicing (what does Mick think about rudiments?) tuning, mics, set up or recording. The video sounds very good and looks OK but has the overall feeling it was put together in a weekend."
3,"Easy to Read, but with not much new","I personally had this book signed by Mr. Noguera after hearing him talk, and found him to be a great speaker, if I had to grade him on being a smart guy, I would give him a 5. However his book honestly wasn't that great. He does a wondeful job of pointing out the problems with many schools, (for once, not blaiming teachers or the kids), but I don't see anything new in his analysis. If you would like a concise view of why many urban schools just aren't that great, then by this book. If you want to read a book describing a new, well thought out idea to change the system and turn the lives of children around, do not buy this book. When I was done reading it, I feel like I could have heard the same thing from listening to the regular complaints of parents and teachers."
2,Pokemon Banks,"I recently purchased the Pokemon Bank thinking it would be fun and useful but I was very disappointed to see the actual size of the bank. This ""bank"" would do well if it would hold 3.00 in quarters."
5,"La douleur, la couleur et le criard","Il montrait sa soeur Sophie qui mourait jeune, entouree de toute la famille. Mais il montrait chacun a l'age qu'il avait a l'epoque de la peinture, et non pas a la mort de la jeune fille. Car la douleur durait a jamais et unifiait toute la famille pour toujours. Puis avec des tetes d'une femme et d'un homme, gravees et multicolorees, il cessait de suivre le style repandu des japonais de faire une seule couleur d'un seul troncon de bois. Son prefere de tout son oeuvre etait Sick Child II, en tant que sa premiere lithographie en couleur. Mais son Scream est le plus reconnu, en tant que l'image la plus frappante du 20eme siecle."
2,Just didn't work for me ...,I bought this product to control squash bugs on squash and cucumber plants. I followed the instructions to the letter and those darn bugs still devoured my plants.
3,a little differnt,all though I am an adult i like the ralph books. so i want to see this video. it was good but not exactly like the boks. in cartoon ralph can talk with sara and her family. the cartoons are good i think adults would enjoy them as much as kids.
1,Broken after warranty ran out,Had the unit 2315 ch for a year and a half. It worked great until one day I was checking the weather and had no digital display. I changed the batteries rebooted the system and did all I coud to get the system running . It just died. It was a great tool when in worked now it is just a $150.00 display. Don't know if I'd buy La Crosse product again
3,some problems with software and not too weather resistant,software could never be installed and the wind speed indicator failed in about a year
1,Impressive looking cheap toy,Spent many hours over weekend installing and attempting to get proper operation wireless or wired with no success. Documentation is very poor for setup.Waited for help on Monday since no support on weekend. We made multiple calls with no way to talk to a tech so we left messages that also were never returned anytime the same day. We returned ws2315 to retailer for a refund.If our time is worth anything we spent $300 worth of wasted time trying to make something work that is very poorly engineered. Wind speed device worked 10% of time no matter if wireless or wired. Rain gauge worked fine. Inside and outside temps fairly accurate. Hunidity less so. Beautiful packaging but unfortunately the flashy look is only that when you try to put it to productive use.
1,delivery very slow!,"Item was delivered (schedule for delivery) two weeks after ordering.....not in time for Christmas, though ordered on Dec 10!!!"
3,Victor Borge vol 1,"I watched ""The Best of Victor Borge"" previously, so Victor Borge Vol. One was a little bit of a let down. He is a very funny man though, so I rated this as ""ok"". I would, however, recommend ""The Best of Victor Borge"" over this one."
2,Not as funny the second time,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Andrew Dice Clay's comedy, his early work was, just plain funny. I have spent many hours listing to his old records, however this DVD was a disapointment, I seen it when it was first broadcast in 1993, It seemed fresher then.. His timing is a bit off, and rehashes his old material. The DVD sound is not that great even though it is advertised as redone in 5.1.. I don't know if it was his mic that night or what. There are no extras except for a lame intro with him trying to rap and hit a punching bag.. On the original broadcast there was a really HUGE comedian named wheels, he was on for about 15 min. They do not mention him in this DVD and he was 10 times as funny as the Diceman was this night."
2,Not very good overall.,"Andrew Dice is more pissed off and obnoxious this time around,and not very funny..There are a few decent laughs but overall its nothing compared to his best show from 1989 'The Diceman Cometh'. I've watched Cometh countless times but I actualy had a hard time finishing a single viewing of No Apologies."
2,Dice Rolls Snake Eyes,"I ordered this DVD because I couldn't find a DVD of my favorite Dice Clay video - The Diceman Cometh. This act was [...] crap compared to his earlier material. He has replaced the many moments of wit and humor (yes, I'm talkin' about Dice) with simple juvenile crudeness. Now, I can deal the nastiest of the nasty, as long as there is some humor involved, but F-word, C-words, etc... are not particularly funny unto themselves. It looks like Dice just dug the ""shock"" value of his rep and ran with that. What is worse (at least on my copy) is the SOUND. I guess it was recorded thru the telephone!!! Some of the words I could not even figure out. There are a couple decent moments which might be worth [$], but my time is more valuable than that!"
2,DONT TRUST AMAZON WITH CAR PARTS!!!!!!,"I was told by Amazon that this mirror would fit my vehicle. I needed a mirror quickly because my inspection was past due and I had already been given a ticket for it. I couldn't find the mirror at Napa so I just found a mirror on Amazon. I entered my vehicle information ant it told me it would fit my vehicle. Turns out that almost any Saturn mirror says the same thing. The mirror didn't fit but I didn't have time to send it back. I put the wrong shaped mirror on just so I could pass inspection. Now I can't return it because its already been used. Long story short, DONT BUY CAR PARTS FROM AMAZON unless you know for a fact the part will fit."
4,Excellent fit for almsot no money,"This is a quality glass mirror for a ludicrously low amount of money. The package arrived with a double-sided sticky tape for effortless mounting. Interestingly, both surfaces of the mirror were reflective, so you can mount it either on the left or right side of the car (I needed it on the right). The fit was near-perfect on my Saturn 1997 SL2 - the shape was perfect, but there was about a 1-2 millimeter gap between the mirror and the plastic enclosure on the car - I don't see such gap on my remaining factory mirror. This is why I'm not giving it 5 stars. Though, considering Saturn is notorious for its terrible tolerances, I would not be surprised it's actually the fault of the enclosure. Either way, you would not notice the gap unless you know its there. Here is the link to the actual picture of the glass: [...]"
3,Too polite,"Rick Margitza make some Blue Note CD's in the early '90's of which ""Hope"" is an out-of-print example. The sound is dated - it's much cleaner and antiseptic-sounded than most 21st-century jazz. The music itself isn't a function of place or time. ""Journey"" starts the CD off nicely, it has a nice melody, and it shows Margitza's somewhat deliberate style. He doesn't aim to play a lot of notes, but goes for taste and melody. ""Song Of Hope"" is okay, but a little too polite. Margitza shows some fire in his ""Stepping Stone"" solo. The difficulty for me is that too many of the songs are a slow mid-tempo and often too mild-mannered. There's nothing to scare anyone off and too little to draw me in. The CD closes with ""Cornfed"", which is chicken-pickin' sounding. It's silly, and a nice change of pace just for that reason. It's a nice CD, but I find it too nice to get more than 3 stars."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I bought this for my boyfriend, because he loves turtles. It is a unique piece and I like the creativity that went into it. However, the size is so small. It truly would be beautiful if it wasn't so small and it's my fault for not reading. It's a shame though that pictures of items sold online are enlarged to look bigger. The title on this should be: Small Sterling Walking Turtle Pendant. Anyway, please read the description on this before purchase."
5,Steinke Gets A Home Run,"I have read all of the reviews on this page, and decided to place my own as well.Steinke takes us into a deep, dark place...into the darkest caverns of the soul, filled with hate, lust, confusion and dread...letting us swim around there, waiting to be drawn out, only to find there is no lifeguard or life preservers. This is not a fairy tale, folks. This is pure emotion and talent here. Steinke displays her ability to write all through out the book. It may be dark, sad, depressing and whatnot, but her name will surely rise and continue to be mentioned and raved about for years to come."
1,Blonde a Bomb,"Not for nothing, but I thought this book sucked. Maybe I'm not as deeply troubled as the people who could identify with its character I thought this book was very very wordy and didn't say a whole lot of anything! It is a perverse sex book hidden behind some profound meaning of ourselves? I don't think so. It would be easier to just go and rent a triple xxx film and get your jollies. I found the writing to be eratic and by the end of the book I felt like I just finished one big run on sentence. I was angry I wasted my time!"
1,Don't bother!,"This short novel comes across as a rambling, loose stream of self-pity and self-loathing. Jesse, the lead character, seems overly passive, drinks through-out the novel. The brief encounters she has with the so-called San Francisco underlife are sporadic and lame. If you are looking for a good reading novel or like mild erotica, this book isn't the one."
4,An Aquired Taste!,"I really enjoy books like this that have the courage to delve into the underworld of this society. It makes me thankful that I am able to keep my head above the waters of everything that may destroy a person in this reality. So if you enjoy peeping into a world that you may not survive if you entered yourself, then this book is something to check out. The underworld of sex, and frightening reality that YOU are your only savior is a wake up call to most that will never go to these extremes to find themselves."
3,A mediocre book,"I was at first enticed by the lured subject matter and depressing overtones, but soon found myself reading a rather mediocre book. Sucide Blonde is still compelling, despite a few dull and stereotypical characters. Namely the confused girl with the troubled past, the horribly depressed struggling bisexual actor, the amoral shameless whore, and the flashy obese woman longing for her younger days. It is quite easy to rush to judgement on this book, but despite some of its blandness, but there were a few redeeming qualities. The main character's, Jesse, descent into the seedy side of San Francisco with drugs and prostitution, was actually very interesting. This book borders very much so on erotic and doesn't cross into that realm that often, at some points it holds back. For those who enjoy a good story, despite a few cliches and trite subjects, this would be one to check out."
4,Dark and pretty,"I have not read this book for a long time, and I really need to reread it again (I think that would be the fifth time). It's a novel full of gorgeous language that I can only describe as being ""water-like"". Steinke paints three gorgeous and tortured characters, playing on the cliche of ""sex=death"" and somehow making it her own. There are some lines that are cliched and melodramatic, but they never reek of insincerity, and she keeps you believing that there is no other place for these people to go except further into the darkness of themselves."
1,Disappointed Books Like This Are Published,"I'm also disappointed in myself that I even completedthis book! I trudged through the pages of sleezeand decadence hoping for some point or perspective onwhy people make choices to abuse themselves or othersand why they delve into the seedy side of life, butone never came. A waste of time and money."
2,Ugh,"Maybe I was misled by the reviews (I know, I know, these are intended to mislead). Somehow I thought this story would be shocking and erotic. Instead it is like taking a bath in self-pity. The nihilistic protagonist drifts from experience to experience, recognizing each negativity, yet powerless to change course. Is the prose itself unenjoyable? No. Will your reaction to the book's worth reflect your own sense of self-worth? Probably. If you have a healthy ego (and especially a healthy sex life), I recommend passing."
4,fabulously written with awesome wordcraft!,"I absolutely loved this book! i picked up the book at a used book store and began reading, i didnt put it down till i was done. the plot and writing are all wonderfully coordinated in one whole masterpiece, the minute i was finished i went to look for more of her work!"
2,"too vulgar for my taste, got in way of storyline",This review is going to be very short and to the point this is definitely an ADULT book. The content is extremely mature and was gulag in my opinion I'm not offended easily but this book was so vulgar that it got in the way of the storyline for me. The ending had a bit of a surprise that I wasn't expected but other then that this book was just way too much for me.
3,interesting,good book but sometimes i didn't know what was being described ... my fault most likely for being slow (lol). very sexual but dark. its interesting.
3,"Good prose, but spotty","This is not Steinke's first novel, though at points it reads like one. Yes, the prose is luscious, intense, and at points quite brilliant, but there's nothing that quite holds it together. Themes are opened and closed with too hard a hand."
3,Always a pleasure to watch Danny Aiello.,"I always enjoy watching Danny Aiello perform, you can really tell he enjoys his craft. This was an interesting movie, a nice way to spend a relaxing evening. Don't miss ""Diner Rush"" if you are a fan it is one of Danny Aiello's best performances!"
4,Good story surrounding the area I grew up in (Brooklyn; Williamsburgh area) NYC,"Strange as this may seem, I watched it on Jan 5th (my deceased Mom's birthday). There is a street scene where people are walking and my Mom was in this movie walking towards the camera). It freaked me out, but it was wonderful to see her as though she were still alive. I don't think she knew she was in this movie."
5,This is so much fun,"I bought the tempera cakes for my 2 years old son and he just loves these. The color is completely washable, does not smell, and it is very easy to paint on paper. I recommend this item for all the people that would like to introduce the art world to their children."
5,The toy that teaches about Jesus' resurrection,I used this toy on Easter Sunday to talk to the children at church about Jesus' rising from the dead. It was great! I used a brown cloth bag to make a cocoon and transformed the toy from a caterpillar to a butterfly inside the bag while I talked... you should have seen their eyes when those colorful wings came out of the bag. This was worth every cent I paid. I had seen one of these used on a Chrysalis Flight before.
2,Resist buying this DVD,"The format of this DVD makes it difficult to use. The 'segments' are broken up by the muscle group the exercises focus on, so there is no 'flow' of exercises that you an easily follow while doing the works.Also, the video doesn't show what the bands are being attached to while these exercises are being performed so it's very difficult to see what the angle should be.The DVD doesn't come with any of the resistance bands adn is over priced for what you get from it. It's very cheaply made and I would not recommend it for anyone who wants to learn by following along with the DVD. You have to watch each section individually."
3,Basic,This video series is about as basic as it comes and only shows you the exercise a few times. This isn't exactly something you could pop into the XBOX and start doing but it's better than nothing.....
4,"Very, very funny!","I am a great fan of Victor Borge, and this collection is superb!...even had a couple of things I had not seen before. Highly recommend!"
5,Good clean fun!!! Hard to find these days!!!,Love the comedy and the music of Victor Borge. It's fun to watch people that see him for the first time and see the laughter that he creates. It is so refreshing to see comedy that does not enclude a four letter word in every sentence!!
2,"Genius at work, tape could be better","Victor Borge's work is incredible, and this tape is a compilation of some of his finest bits (See end of this review for a list). Unfortunately, unlike the tapes you rent at the video store, this tape is in the grainy EP mode, so Borge is not presented as well as one might have wished. The materialrates a 5, but the EP speed rates this tape a 2. If the nonstandard EP speed had been listed so that the buyer could choose their own personal price/quality trade-off, then that would have given it a 3 or 4.Introducing Mozart............ My Favorite Barber............ Introducing Marilyn Mulvey............ Aria from ""Rigor Mortis"" by Joe Green............ The Timid Page Turner............ Phonetic Punctuation............ Inflationary Language............ Sahan Arzruni with the ""2nd Rhapsody"" by Fliszt............ Salieri Opera (sometimes called Mozart Opera)............ Danish Lullaby."
3,Borge's Superb; Tape is Terrible,"As to be expected, Victor Borge provides absolute joy with his performance of various presentations on this tape. Disgustingly, however, the tape degrades your pleasure. Why? Simply because the tape is recorded at SLP. Never mind that it COULD HAVE BEEN recorded at SP with a quantum leap in quality. No, the bean counters, intent on saving a mere pittance in tape, chose to record at SLP. They didn't, however, lower the price from a rather hefty near-twenty bucks to start with to half that price. You'll still enjoy seeing Borge at his best. However, be prepared for poor video quality at less than closeup shots and exceptionally tinny audio during high notes of his piano playing. It's so sad that great entertainment such as this is nearly ruined by the quest for the almighty dollar. Or, in this case, probably no more than an extra fifty cents worth of tape."
4,Classic Victor Borge Style,"What more can I say? If you haven't heard of or watched his routine, you need to. It's clean, quick-witted and very entertaining. If you've seen it once, it's the same routine he does everywhere, but that's not to say it isn't worth watching more than once."
5,Best Musical Comedy My Family Has Ever Seen,"What can I say? We laughed until we cried the first time we saw it, but the humor never grows old. It gets better each time."
4,"Great, funny and all that!",My husband was happy that I found this one. At one time he had it in the VHS format and now we are changing our tapes into DVDs.
1,don't buy this,unless you have never seen or heard Victor Borge perform somewhere. It has duplicate material and I returned it for credit.
1,Bad VHS burned to DVD,"Wow - I was shocked at the poor quality of this DVD. Be warned - this is the poorest quality DVD I have ever purchased from Amazon. It appears that someone had an old VHS tape of a PBS Fundathon [which is about the only time PBS plays decent stuff like this] and transferred it to DVD. The only reason it gets 1 star is for the content - the presentation is so bad it almost completely ruins the show. It's like watching TV off an antenna when the weather was bad. Come to think of it.....And they did a lousy job of it.The content is [mostly] all there, though there seems to be a couple of bits missing - probably poor editing when this lousy excuse was transferred from whatever medium it was on originally.You have been warned - avoid this particular version of the Maestro's work. Pay a couple extra dollars for a different version. And shame on whomever did this!"
2,Victor Borge is great - this DVD isn't,This DVD is very inadequate in showing the amount of humor Victor Borge is known for. And the length of the DVD is very short for what I was expecting. I was dissatisfied and returned the 3 unopened DVD's of the 4 I purchased for Christmas gifts.
3,Victor was funny but the dvd was not,"Victor Borge is quite funny & I was very glad when I finally got this-until I began watching it. It seems copied off an old vcr tape in quality-I was surprised by that. What surprised me most was that what was listed on the package as to what was supposed to be on the dvd wasn't all on there-a few of the acts listed were not even in his routine-& I watched it more than once to see if it was part of another act ,but that wasn't the case. I've watched Vicor B. many times on PBS & love his routines, but found this below standard.The only saving grace was his humor.If the quality had been better 7 all the materil had been there I would deffinatly given it 5 stars. Despite this it is still very funny."
5,Perfect!,"These boots fit like a glove. There some of the most comfortable, but fashionable boots I own."
5,easy and informative reference,"for a novice to Enneagrams, this is a straightforward, easy to follow review of all 9 enneagrams plus more. a perfect starter book."
3,A bit too easy,"""The Enneagram Made is Easy"" is making an honest attempt at breaking down a rather complex system to give the uninitiated a brief understanding of the Enneagram. The problem with that is that it makes the Enneagram look trivial and the value of the system is completely lost. Instead of showing what a beautiful mirror and map to the complexity human soul this system is, ""The Enneagram Made Easy"" helps reinforce stereotypes of the types and probably will turn people away from exploring the Enneagram deeper. I think that Riso and Hudson's ""The Wisdom of The Enneagram"" is a much better introduction to the system. It is also much better written than this book."
3,"Timely delivery, Book ok, depends on what you are looking for.","This book seems to be based on a Myers Briggs type of personality differentiation, but in my opinion does not do a good job with pulling together the various ideas presented. I bought it because it is a book being used by a group I am a part of. The seller marked it as ""good"" condition, I would have classified it either ""as new"" or ""excellent"" condition. The speed of delivery was excellent.The Enneagram Made Easy: Discover the 9 Types of People"
5,Great Book that is simple to understand,"I am very familiar with the enneagram, but for people who are not, or if your just learning, this is the book for you! It makes it so easy to understand, but still contains all the wonderful information you need to learn about yourself and others!"
5,A must read book for anyone wishing to learn about the Enneagram,This is an outstanding first book for anyone wishing to learn about the enneagram. I have all my spiritual journey participants start with this book. It is user friendly and fun.
4,Helping to Understand Why.,"I had previous knowledge of the Enneagram but needed a deeper understanding of its ramifications for me. The format of this book illustrates succinctly the different facets of personality. The cartoon illustrations bring the traits of ones personality type to life without diminishing the importance of the written text. They show clearly the strengths and weaknesses enabling one to use strengths to advantage and, at the same time, curb weaknesses. This encourages more harmonious relationships."
3,"cute, worth the money, but bad double zipper","The jacket is cute and worth the money but the zipper is really made of poor quality, I can barely get the zipper up or down.The double zipper doesn't align properly and is very difficult to zip. However it is toasty and I guess the $29.00 was worth it."
2,cheap and CHEAP,"This coat seemed like a great deal but once I received it I see why it is so cheap. The zipper is crummy and the side pocket zipper pull broke off when I went to zip one of them open. The feel of the jacket is also CHEAP and the removable faux fur hood embellishment looks like rat fur and it also looks like it is coming off the huge hood. It could be cute if the hood had a better design and the fur was nicer, fix those zippers and get some nicer feeling fabric and it could be a winner! Close but no cigar...."
4,It's all right,"I wanted to change my star rating to 3 stars, but I don't know how to do it. The jacket is lightweight, and has a flattering fit. There are two zipped pockets in the front. However, the sleeves (for a medium) were barely long enough, and the hood is way too oversized to wear. There are no draw strings or buttons for the hood, so it doesn't really stay on very well; it's there (hanging on back of coat) entirely for looks only. It's not a heavy coat, so if you're thinking of taking it up to the snow, you may want to think twice if the temperature gets in the 50's. I've had it for about 2 months now, and the down is starting to come out of the coat."
5,Great jacket at great price!,"Received my jacket today and immediately put it on as the temperature is 15 degrees with a wind chill of 2. It is very warm and stylish! The zipper does require a little more ""force"" than most. Another bonus is that while the description says dry clean only, the tag states that it can also be machine washed. That is a plus for me, whose 2 year old treats my clothing as his personal kleenex!"
3,dvd Victor Borge vol 2,"I watched ""The Best of Victor Borge"" previously, so Victor Borge Vol. Two was a little bit of a let down. He is a very funny man though, so I rated this as ""ok"". I would, however, recommend ""The Best of Victor Borge"" over this one."
4,Learn typing quick!!!,Learn typing quick and easy is a great typing tutor! I learned how to touch type really good in 5 days. It shows every thing you have to do and you do that. Then you practice that using the four games that they give you.(which are fun)Thats why I choose to write a reveiw on this tutor because it really works.
5,Response to D. Holmes....,"Sorry about the mishap! We (The Impossebulls) didn't find out about the error the manufacturer made until the last minute, so if you would like, go to http://www.impossebulls.com and inform C-Doc about your situation and it will be taken care of.P.S. Oh yeah, I'd buy it because it is totally nothing like what's out there....No Corporate Rhyming!Lastly, my Solo CD is available on Amazon too. It is called ""One Man Against Many!""PeacePvt MilitantwARLORD eTERNAL..."
3,"""Paradiso"" Skywalk","The same personnel line up as ""The Bohemians"" but by nomeans as good of material though a couple of highlightsare Nepenthe and The Backstretch which if you're not gonnaspend a lot are more than worth it if you're interested ingetting the rest of their collection like I was. Nepenthesets up a junglescape with flute carrying the melody whichlater gives way to a sax solo and returns to the beginningfor the outro. The Backstretch is a drivin' tune with thesynth doing most of the talkin'-solid tune but no solo persay. View From The Bridge does have some nice bass solo work."
1,"Poorly researched, incomplete and inaccurate","Having just read this so called biography, I am amazed at some of the comments from readers and reviewers alike. ""Well researched""?""Well documented""? ""Balanced""? The book is full of errors!There are blatant mistakes and distortions on virtually every page! E.G.Page 15: Filignano is in the Molise region not Abruzzi. Page 37: The RCA contract was signed in February 1945 not October 1944. Page 47: The apartment was not rent free. Lanza paid $75 per month for it.Page 219: Lanza and Di Stefano never met. I know Di Stefano. They only spoke twice on the telephone.Need I go on? I have spent a lifetime researching the life and career of Lanza (the last 20 years working on a biography.)I cannot believe that Amadeus actually published this almost completely inaccurate book. As for Mr. Bessette, I don't know his motives for attempting this futile exercise, but the mere fact that he relied on Al Teitelbaum as his main source of information says it all."
1,Appears he used information from other books!,"I have read every book out on Lanza. This book, although has different pictures in it, nonetheless is a carbon copy of all the others, with nothing new added, except some alleged isolated, unprovable stories. I suppose one could ask how and from whom after 40 years since Mario died, did he get this 'new' information, when other authors who were very close to Mario and would have had this information, never knew about it. My opinion is that this book has absolutely nothing new added to it. My concern is only that this book defames not only Mario Lanza, but his family as well, which is not appreciated by Mario's following and should be questioned in any interviews that he may have. After all, he never knew any of the family nor did he ever meet mario Lanza."
3,"Well balanced, but sordid","This is a good run of the mill celebrity biography. Certainly it gives an explanation of some the dynamics of Lanza's life from a medical and psychiatric background and actually makes it more sympathetic to them. In fact, the Lanzas' lives, complicated by mental illness and substance addiction, were very tragic. On the other hand, the author could have expanded his list of sources. This limitation is my primary objection to the book. I must say I am very surprised by the virtulant response to this book because much of this was already known and published, and Lanza, like most of us, did not lead a perfect life"
2,Too Much Negativity!,"Mario Lanza was one of the greatest tenors of all time. I was only 7 when he died, but I remember listening to my sister's records of him, especially ""The Student Prince"", which I still have, along with some of his CD's and all his movies. This book seems to desicrate his memory--and all the happiness his wonderful voice brought to everyone. I enjoyed the pictures, but did not care for the tone of the book, which seemed unnecessarily negative. I agree with you, Damon! Your Dad was wonderful!"
1,Depressing list of Lanza's failings.,"This is a depressing list of Lanza's failings, passing as a biography. It's everything negative about Lanza that you didn't want to know.If you've seen Lanza in his movies, you won't find that Lanza here."
5,Absolutely Indispensable,"This is by far the most comprehensive guide to consignment shop ownership I have ever seen. It is chock full of practical details (and issues) that I never would have considered - but are essential to running a successful shop.If you are thinking about going into this business, this is an absolute must-read. It saved me from making a costly mistake that could have sabotaged my entire business plan."
4,"Almost Vegetarian, Ultra Low Fat",The recipes are very easy and most of the ingredients I had on hand...except the chicken broth. Being a vegetarian for the last 9 years this is something I would never have in my kitchen. But I was able to substitute if for vegatable broth. I think the recipes are easy and tasty but the title is misleading.
5,Couldn't be happier,"Even though the series started and ended more than a decade before I was born and it was close to a quarter century after before I watched my first episode. I became an instant fan and with individual seasons selling for as much as $59.99 and the whole series for $244.99 I thought I would be stuck recording episodes in the early, early morning, or waiting for the marathons that come on roughly twice a year to get my fix, but thanks to an Amazon.Com Gold Box Deal, I was able to get The Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection for under $100.00 plus free shipping and as the title says I couldn't be happier."
5,Incredible Collection at a great price!,This is a must for any Twilight Zone fan. I'd had it in my wishlist forever and when I saw it listed for $115 I grabbed it. I'm so happy I did. I look forward to the TZ marathon every year. This year I had my own marathon with no commercials and I can watch this whenever I want now. It's truly a prized piece in my DVD collection.
5,All the classics.,"Everyone below has outlined the product effectively.My main problems with the set are the lack of a Play All option on every disc and the seemingly fragile disc cases (which also may potentially damage the disc if one is not careful in putting them back).Other than that, the content is phenomenal."
5,The Twilight Zone--Definitive Collection,This collection is fabulous. I gave it to my husband for Christmas. He is a huge Twilight Zone fan and absolutely loves the collection. Now he does not have to wait for a Twilight Zone marathon on the Sci-Fi channel. Thanks.
5,Twilight Zone Great DVD set!,Great DVD collection with very clean footage. On T.V broadcast during New Year's marathon a hiss coul be heard. Considering the quality of recordings from the 60's that is expected. However most of hiss has been removed on the DVD set. Really great job on video with great contrast. Of course the stories and acting are the best!
5,Great product!,"There was a special price on the Blue-ray edition of TZ and I was keen to watch the series again after so many years (and share with my daughter). The Quality is great, very crisp, and reflects the general quality of production for the Twilight Zone series. Its in the square TV format so if your used to the wide-screen editions it may be a slight impediment, but for me its fine.There is a lot of extra material bundled with the Blue-ray edition too which is nice (I liked the radio versions of the shows especially), and for the price it was really good value."
4,Boatskipper,"This is truly a complete set, and I enjoyed every episode... then I noticed that Netflix offered Twilight Zone, so I switched to them for viewing, because it was easier than loading a disc each time. However, Netflix is missing one of the seasons (Season 4, I think, about 18 episodes), so I will need to use the disc for that viewing."
3,5 star show 2 star everything else,"I would rate the show with five stars, the packaging two stars and the purchase two stars. How do you get this discs out without bending them? I think that amazon has sold me a used item that was re-shrink wraped. Some of the discs had finger prints on them and one is scratched. The episode guide for season one was also missing. The DVDs were shipped in a plain box with no padding inside either. My worst experience with amazon yet."
3,episode missing,"Where is the pilot that aired in 1958, The Time Element?Sorry if this is a duplicate post. Im just getting familiar with this site."
4,Memory Lane,Watching some of the many episodes I watched for the first time years ago .. surprising how many I remembered.
3,very hard to get DVDs out of holder,"Love the series, but it is way to hard to get the DVDs out of the package. They will probaly break after only a few times of using them."
5,Great service,"I was anxious the first order was from Japan.However, I was impressed with fine service.Orders from abroad also, no problem.Thank you."
4,Great Product,"I received it in great condition. I love the original Twilight Zone and each disc plays great. I really like the menu set-up (the main menu has a link to each episode on the disc and you can select that episode and select which scene you would like). One thing I would change, is how it is packaged. Each DVD case has each season in it, which contains 5-6 DVDs, they can be hard to push the button down to remove the disc and they catch on one another it feels like you might break the disc in half, but oh well now. Maybe 4 discs per case would have been better? put 2 discs on one side then another 2 on the other side."
4,"Great, but not perfect","This is obviously a great collection with all of the extras, but I have two issues with the set. The Desilu Playhouse episode of 'The Time Element' is not included for whatever reason; which is disappointing. Also, the insert paper lists the episodes completely out of order, although the discs are in chronological order; confusing. Overall great, but get it right next time."
3,"Great set, horrible packaging","I received this for Christmas 2012. The set itself is great, however, when I opened it most of the discs were scratched. They are packaged on top of each other and the second disc doesn't have room to fit in without hitting the middle plastic piece of the first disc and this has caused scratches on the discs. Some of the 28 discs had come loose, from not fitting correctly, and were lightly scratched, some had deep scratches."
5,Greatest Sci Fi / Fantasy series ever!!,"Can't say anything to take away from these fine reviews of the greatest Sci Fi/Fantasy tv series ever done! It spawned 2 re-makes, one in the 80's and a movie, and early at the turn of the century the other. Still the original is still the best. I own the original sets with the 1st season having the Zicree book included. Yes, but I paid top dollar for the complete sets in seperate purchases. This is a true bargain at this price. Having viewed all the episodes when aired in late 1959 thru the early 60's I must say the quality is pristine and excellent, unlike the way I watched it on a black & white set those many years ago.With the exception of not having the ""One Step Beyond"" intro music, this is by far the most enjoyable, truly lasting tv series you will ever own.Nuff Said!!"
5,twilight zone complete collection,"I couldn't decide which seasons I wanted, so I bought the whole collection. My only complaint is that the dvd seems slow to respond when I click on my selections. Otherwise it's a great purchase."
5,Great collection!,"If you are a true Twilight Zone fan, this collection is a must. It has every episode and extra stuff. Well worth the money!"
4,Twilight Zone is Awesome!,"I got this for my husband for his birthday and he was thrilled! It is incredible to have the entire collection of episodes. The only feature we don't like is that there is not a ""Play All"" button on each disc. That would be a great feature to have for those of that are huge fans and like to watch episode after episode. Other than that this is WELL worth the money and a great addition to our collection!"
5,Really nice classic,"Really nice classic collection to own.Especailly if you like old movies.Twilight zone used to air every wednsday night,back in the ealy 60s,a lot of popular actors first got started on their careers with twilight zone.we see a lot of them,Simeon Oakland who later was on the nightstalker with Darren Mcgavin.Then Steve Forest that played on SWAT,and many others.I recommend getting the whole series collection though,Instead of buying the seasons Individually.its way more expensive to buy the individual seasons.If you buy the whole series you wont have it all watched in one weekend.Carefull where you buy it though."
2,No Closed Captions,Had to return my copy of this great series because I'm hearing impaired and it doesn't have closed captions! I enjoy my shows with closed captions!
5,Good Amazon Purchase!,"The CDs arrived in good shape, well packed and received earlier than I anticipated. An A++"
4,Great box set,"You wouldn't think A Black And White old T V show would look all that much better on blueray But I saw a much better Picture on the blueray , over the DVD, verison. and theres lots of xtras on this box set, also the episodes all have Isolated Music scores on them I'm petty happy with this box set."
4,"Glad the Zone is on Blu Ray, but CBS didn't bother to make a true collectors set.","I received this ""set"" as an Amazon Gold Box deal, and for the price it was well worth it. It is in my view however, NOT worth the asking price because the set is only the 5 individual Blu Ray discs wrapped together with plastic wrap. Not much of a ""set"" for collectors.CBS should be ashamed of themselves for not bothering to create a true ""The Twilight Zone"" Blue Ray boxed set. Other studios do it but CBS does not because they have been notably cheap in regards to ""The Twilight Zone"". An example of this is CBS doing NOTHING to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the series. CBS did not acknowledge the fans or honor and recognize the actors, writers, producers, and Rod Serling himself, ""The Twilight Zone's"" creator.The quality of the transfers for this Blu Ray ""set' is outstanding, too bad CBS dropped the ball for collectors by not creating a true collectors set."
5,Xmas Gift Well Worth It,"I couldn't help but order the entire collection for my father for Xmas. It ended up being a last-minute splurge, yet it managed to arrive just in time for our get-together. The box is of average-good quality, and the collection comes complete with notes and special features for an added touch. If you're a TV series box-set collector, this will be a nice addition. If you're shopping for a Twilight Zone fan, this will definitely be a worth-while gift."
5,Almost definitive...,"If this is the Complete Definitive Collection of the Twilight Zone, why doesn't it include ""The Time Element,"" the true precursor/pilot to the TZ? This is a great set with a lot of great, rare extras, but including ""The Time Element"" would have made it a triple A-plus."
5,The best edition of the best series.,"Did you know that Rod Serling had a hair-lip? High definition!!In all seriousness, it's a joy to watch these gems and the extras included in HD. Great set."
4,good experience,I live in Canada where the Twighlight Zone Complete Series costs $250++. I bought it used (good condition)for under $100. SO far we've gone through 1.5 seasons of 5 and the disks are fine. I'm hoping th erest are as good. As far as the series - I am enjoying this as if it was the first time. The quality of the video is great (HD)except for the odd episode which is TV qaulity. I guess the orginal film was not available for remastering. Shipping and handling were $7. I'm doing a lot of US shopping since the Canadian dollar is at par.
1,holy cow,mother of god why would anyone pay that price? i just watched a million episodes on tv yesterday for free (not including the monthly cable bill).
2,$150??!!!,"i think thats alot of money for this. i mean just because something sells alot, doesnt mean you have to cheat other people by going up on the price. american greed strikes again!!"
5,In the Zone,I have been a twilight zone fan since I was a kid. Through the years I collected several episodes on DVD but was never able to find the episodes I really loved and missed. When I saw the complete collection of episodes on amazon I knew I had to buy them no matter how much they cost. I have been watching and rewatching my favorite episodes since and enjoying new ones that I have never seen before. Thanks for the great package.
5,christmas present,glad to get the whole set! it was a gift and I am still watching all the episodes. will now look for dark side and outer limits.
4,They Don't Write Stories Like These Anymore,"Rod Serling is still (in my opinion) the definitive creator of mind-bender stories with macabre endings. This DVD set includes all 156 of the original episodes. Delivery of this item took close to a month, much too long even using the USPS. In the meantime, I was unable to initially track the item until the Seller activated/re-submitted the tracking number to USPS. This intended Christmas present did not arrive until 03Jan12. Upon arrival, the first DVD had a problem: second episode, track one would play the audio but the video was locked on the opening image. I have to skip to track two to get video...very annoying and disappointing. Beyond that, no further problems so far. Keep in mind that each episode is like starting a new DVD, so keep your remote handy for lots of menu work. If you purchase this product from this Seller, be clear on the delivery date: you may wish to upgrade shipping to get it sooner."
4,Satisfied after a long wait,"After first hearing about this collection in 2005, I watched the price rise and fall many times. I got a great deal on it and 28 DVDs are well worth the price for this. A long-time fan of the TV marathons, there are several episodes that I have never seen! There is only 1 complaint I have about this set in that there is no feature of ""play all"" on each disc. Therefore, I have to manually go back to the main menu and go to the next episode and start. Additionally, there is no way to ""repeat all"" either. Sometimes I would just like to put on a disc and let it play! There is also no option for subtitles. Otherwise, this is a nicely put-together set and essential for any true fan."
5,Completly Amazing...,"Endless glory... there is no reason you should not own this if you are a Twilight Zone fan. I do not recommend watching right before bed, unless you want a night full of crazy dreams. Enjoy!!!"
5,Ultimate Twilight Zone satisfaction,"I waited for a long time to buy this treat for myself ~ and I am thrilled to death. I am only sorry I waited so long to buy it. I love Twilight Zone and the DVDs are the only way to watch the series. I have found episodes that I had not seen before, which was exciting. I am very satisfied!!"
5,Fantastic Quality!,"Upon the release of this amazing collection, I soon realized that it would be the perfect gift for my moms birthday! I was right!We plowed through season one in a weekend, and had finished all five seasons by the end of the month!The quality is fantastic, and this really is a great purchase!"
5,There's a fifth dimension...,"Simply perfect! I was not able to find it in France -or only the first season for a too expensive price- and simply with a multizone DVD player and a good old creditcard, I can enter the twilight zone and a lot of extras whenever I want, it is always a pleasure to see the stories and Rod Sterling"
5,The price goes down - - the quality goes up,"I spent over $800 on the VHS videos from Columbia House two decades ago. I spent less than $140 for the DVD set and discovered more treasures, rare filmed interviews, bonus extras and high-quality transfers that are far superior to what I have been watching the past 20 years.The retail price keep lowering over the months but by now it's beyond affordable. I recommend you grab it today.I also suggest you buy ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Watching the shows is one thing, knowing the behind-the-scenes stuff is even more fun. Both are available on Amazon."
3,CLASSIC TELEVISION,I HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SET FOR A YEAR. WANTED TO GET IT FOR MY HUSBAND BUT WAS A BIT PRICEY. WHEN IT WAS PRICED BETTER I BOUGHT IT. HE WATCHES MOST OF HIS DVDS ON HIS LAPTOP AND HAS BEEN BOTHERED WITH SOME OF THE DISCS NOT PLAYING THROUGH. WE CAN WATCH ON OUR DVD PLAYER/TELEVISON BUT WE ARE NOT HAPPY CAMPERS. COMPLETE SET AND HAS EVERY EPISODE MADE IN ORDER OF THEIR SHOWING ON TELEVISION. GREAT STORIES AND ACTORS.
2,"Not ""completely digitally"" restored...",Everything was great about this box set except that starting in season 2 many episodes are not digitally remastered like the packaging claims. Some of them are like watching old worn out video tapes. They should all be restored with the technology of today. I was disappointed since this is a complete box set and it's an all time classic from the atomic era. Also it is expensive so I assumed it would all be restored and cleaned up so beware. Nobody else has mentioned this in their reviews so maybe I got a bootleg or a bad version. Who knows but I was disappointed. It doesn't have subtitles so that was a surprise.
3,Why isn't Season 1 captioned????,"I own the complete set of The Twilight Zone from Seasons 1 through 5. The sets for Seasons 2-5 have closed captions. They are a blessing because we are able to completely enjoy the programs which were part of our childhood years. Why isn't Season 1 captioned???? When can we expect Image or another company to pick up the ball and get that season captioned? I have no doubt that if this is done, many customers with hearing loss will surely want to get their hands on that set and watch the proceedings. The explanation for my rating is that a 5 is given to the quality of the Twilight Zone programs in all five sets and a 0 for the lack of captioning for Season One which provides an overall rating of 3."
5,great collection,"this is a great box set, it has fewer dvd's than the DVD's done before, especially since they were not even released in epidosde order, extras are nice too. Highly recommend for anyone totally into The Twilight Zone."
5,Exceptional value; prompt delivery. High 5!!!!,"We are very happy with the product. Great price, prompt delivery. Overall great buying experience."
4,Awesome,"The first series is by far the most important for Rob Sterling. I however think that if you are going to invest in a series such as this, I would go for the entire 1-5 season blue ray box set. Totally worth it and not too much more. You get all of the seasons instead of just 1 which gives you the complete Twilight Zone marathon packed full of special features such as video commentaries, video interviews, stills, music scores and much more. Definitely worth it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007I8KXQ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B007I8KXQ8&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazon070f-20"
5,You haven't seen The Twilight Zone until you've seen it on blu-ray.,"Most of us grew up watching The Twilight Zone on relatively small screens. It's hard to believe the amount of detail in the picture, and the beauty of the cinematography in some of these episodes until you see them in high resolution on a large screen. I have a projector and a 106"" screen, and seasons 1 and 2 in particular are absolutely stunning. Nevermind that this is one of the best series ever created for television, you many not fully remember how good it all is, until you see it like this. Absolutely worth the price on blu-ray."
4,Marc Zicree Shut Up,"The collection is great, but ... the interviews by Marc Zicree will be some of the most irritating things you've ever heard in your life. Extras that could have been very interesting will drive you to insanity because Zicree insists on incessantly saying ""uh huh"" throughout the comments by the individual being interviewed. Too bad they couldn't figure out a way to redo the audio to these interviews to eliminate his uh huhs."
2,Setbacks...,"Hi Definition does have its setbacks. These episodes weren't meant to be seen with such clarity, as now you can spot the seam in the background cylcorama at 18:21 in ""The Grave"", or the fact that in ""Eye of the Beholder"" the nurse walking into the room at the very beginning is not wearing any 'ugly' makeup, among many other ""flaws"" which were not noticeable before the advent of remasters or Hi Res screens... AND we're still expected to pay such a high price for the Blu-Ray version, where they are more evident."
4,No CC or HOH,"A Pity that the producers have not added closed caption for the Hard of Hearing! PITY PITYNO Sale here and probably none for another 100 MILLION hard of hearing people.Ata go - come back to this when your hearing deteriorates, Mr. Movie Man."
1,"Show is amazing, the set is overpriced","If you buy the individual seasons that amazon sells together it's 233, if you buy this set it's 333. I don't think they did the math since it equals to the box that holds the bluray seasons costing 100 dollars. Just to let everyone know :)"
1,Basic math anyone,"I started to buy this complete set, then I saw each individual season was $50. 5 x $50 = $250.... So, why would I pay $350 for the bundle, shouldn't I save money with a bundle? I'll be buying these all individually."
3,Twilight Zone Definitive Collection,"This was a Christmas gift for my 18 year old son, who is a huge Twilight Series fan! It was his favorite gift. It arrived on time, in great condition, and was a great price. I have even become a new fan!!"
5,Memories!!,"Just received my box set,one day before my 60th. birthday. Man these episodes bring back the memories,my childhood days of watching Twilight Zone. A great set, GET IT !!"
5,Two words: Absolutely magnificent,"This set is a must for any science fiction, horror or anthology TV fan. How can you beat all of the original Twilight Zone episodes for less than $1 an episode. Tons written by Richard Matheson, Rod Serling, too many classic episodes to mention. You will not regret for one moment this purchase, just enjoy it."
4,Great television series,"Except for the poor packaging which used ""easily-breaks"" plastic instead of the ""soft"" or ""bendable"" plastic, this DVD set is fantastic and it even has captions (unlike the Poirot series). Rod Serling was truly a genius!"
5,Twilight Zone Complete Definitive Edition,I ordered this product and received it in about a week or so. It came in perfect condition with no problems. Very excited to have the complete series so I do not have to wait for the marathons!
5,amazing,Great dvds. Great quality. Great shipping time. Great condition. Look forward to watching this for months to come. Thank you very much.
5,Great show!,"The show is great - not much to say about that - and I'm getting to rediscover that Rod Serling said things like ""discombooberated"" and pronounced robot like ""robut."" I appreciate that they include at the end of each episode the ""next time on the Twilight Zone"" segments. The one problem I've found so far is that the packaging isn't great."
5,twilight zone box set,This box set is perfect for any Twilight Zone fan. It has every episode made. There were some that they don't put on tv. Watch your favorites over and over.
3,A collection of songs from many years,"This album has another name ""On The Sunny Side of the Street"" distributed by creative labs. I have not been able to learn anything about dates of recordings. The quality varies considerably. However, for a Sinatra fan many of the songs on this cd can be found NOWHERE else."
5,Mr.Capon-E,"When Mr.Capone-E Droped This Album It Was Bien Firme. I Liked It When I First Heard It,He Really Puts It Down. He Doesn't Fu*k Around With His Music. He's 1 Of The Chicano Rapers That Puts It Down For The Raza."
3,SOUTHSIDES FIRST AND ONLY,"ABOUT 13 YEARS A VATO NAMED ESE RICH ROCK FROM SPANISH FLY TOLD IT LIKE IT WAS NOWADAYS CHICANO RAP IS SOLD OUT .TOO BAD ESE RICH ROCK WASNT STILL AROUND TO MAKE THESE FOOLS SEEM LIKE FAIRY TALES COMPARED TO HIS MAIN LINE STORY.IF YOU WANT TO BE SCHOOLED DOWN BY THE VET PICK UP ESE RICH ROCK ""WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS"" OR SPANISH F.L.Y ""TRUST NO MAN."
4,Good book,Good book. Enjoyed it very much. Light read. Good information about history especially about the formation of the new state of Israel.
3,"Smart, yes, but wise only in its own eyes","Many of the ideas expressed in this book ring true regarding children's learning process. However, be wary of such subtleties as suggesting as fact to your child that this world or things in it have been around for myriads of years. That is not fact, but theory, no matter how widely accepted. The book also advises against corporal discipline, with insignificant substantiation and a single footnoted reference. In place of the wisdom of Solomon, this book suggests mere time outs and moral explications, but relegates the chastening of tough love to archaic obscurity, despite admitting its use by 90% of parents. Perhaps some children of the remaining 10% will become the future intelligent leaders of tomorrow, of companies like Enron and Worldcom."
5,Here come my dream!,"Yeah!that's it!Wow,excellent audio,excellent compilation,incredible tracks never released before,instead of bad vocals of Mr.Lee Jacson,reason of end of The Nice.GOOD DEAL."
1,HS-DHTGL R5,"Careful. This is a terrible product all the way around. Terrible to manage, operate, and to keep data.Every power glitch (yes have ups) causes RAID failures and drive problems (will not boot) The unit alos locks up which the only way to start again is to cycle power and that is essentially a power glitch corrupting the disks.There is a horrible tftp and flash re-writing procedure to get going (restructure array) and the last time it quit working all together.The unit has a very long response time on the web interface. It is the only way to manage the unit and timeouts are frequent. It is a nightmare to use.Customer support using the and web support forums are gretted as mild inconveniences to the staff and they don't really care whether the unit works or not."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought a $750 paper weight. After returning the first unit I bought, I turned the second unit on for a third time when I got an E04 error. I called tech support and they had me update the firmware. That did not help. At this point in time, the tech said there was nothing else he could do and that I had a big paper weight. That was it. Oh he did mention that I could restore my data by sending it to a data recovery firm. I have purchased many computer related products over the last 15 years and have worked with many more -- I work in the industry -- but I have never been so dissatisfied with a product as I have with this unit. Not to mention their unwillingness to help."
2,Nowhere as good as Starbucks Sumatra.,"Just bought a bag at a local Costco for only $16.59. The green oval label on top says ""Roasted from Certified Organic coffee beans."" I guess this is why it wasn't as flavorful as Starbucks (non-organic) Sumatra. It wasn't sour at all like blacksmithgirl claims. I guess her bag must have gone rancid. But it's too mild and too bitter for my taste. You get what you pay for. The worst part of waking up is this crap in your cup!"
1,not enjoyable,Not rich and complex like other Sumatra coffees I have tasted.First cup of fresh bag had an overwhelming sour taste. I plan on returning this bag of coffee as I don't think I can sacrifice 2.5lb worth of mornings to it's lack of character.
3,Manufacturer info is wrong.,"The brand is Seattle Mountain, but the manufacturer is actually Costco. The markup here is a little high. This is the in-house roasted brand of Costco. (Not to be confused with Kirkland brand)."
3,talking keychain,I'm a fan of talking keychains and toys for a quick laugh or puzzled look. This fit the mold and was mildly amusing for a while.
3,Good Family Fun,"Fans of the sitcom will enjoy this film, in which the Munster family become involved in a series of oddball capers during a trip to England. The British cast members complement the TV cast quite well, making this a very funny film which the entire family can enjoy. Another interesting feature about this film is that, unlike the TV series, it is filmed in color, giving the viewer an opportunity to see the Munsters in all their delightfully ghoulish glory. This one is vastly superior to both the 1981 reunion film ""Revenge of the Munsters"" and the dreadful syndicated series, ""The New Munsters"" which has none of the attributes which made the original series a winner. This one boasts the full TV cast (in their prime), a good script, and good direction. Highly recommended."
5,Part of history.,"Big Giants fan, so I had to have this little piece of Giants history to show my grand kids in the future."
4,Great album,"This really is a great album, with good Spanish rock-songs. There is a good mix between up-tempo and slower songs."
5,Fussbudget,"If you like golf but are tired of the same old golf games, try this! This game is a total blast. I love it!"
3,Great game but CD-Rom will not install any more,"I love Links Extreme but since I replaced my laptop the game will not install any more. Apparently it does not like DVD-CDrw drives, and it errors out during the install process when copying player files regardless of the install options selected."
2,Not so good review.,"I did not really like this CD, and I am an avid fan of Nina Simone. I guess I put too much confidence in a review I had read re this CD. I was very disappointed. Sorry."
3,Very basic...,"...and basic is good for kids as an introduction to mandalas. Don't get me wrong, I have had fun and relaxation with Mandalas of the Celts, but I guess I was thinking it would be more complex. I'm not disappointed, just surprised. It is worth what you pay for it."
4,Listen and read for best results!,"This is a good overview of the British singer/songwriter/actor's recorded efforts although I remember seeing him perform an excellent version of Dylan's ""It's All Over Now,Baby Blue"" on Hullabaloo that I would have liked to have seen included here.As good as many of the songs are,Mr.Harrison's liner notes should be read as you listen.The combined effect is like having a conversation with this talented,charming,self-deprecating performer.If you haven't written your memoirs yet,Mr. Harrison,you should.I think they would be very entertaining."
3,"Great Victor as always, but the dvd itself...","He's hillarious. 5 stars.He's extremely talented. 5 stars.And he's kept most of his hair throughout the years. 4 stars.The only issue I have is with the DVD itself. I remember watching this on tv, ohhh, roughly 15 years ago. We recorded it on VHS (that's a rectangular plastic device invented back in the stone ages for you younger kids). There were routines he did as well as other performances that are not included with this dvd, which is really too bad. For the first time ever I have bought a dvd that has less than what was shown on tv."
4,It's all good,"You need to watch Victor Borge A few times in your life. The act remains pretty unchanged throughout his career, but was so brilliant the first time, that you need to watch it if you haven't before.I bought this because my son had not seen him before and watching it with him made me remember how fun it was. We laughed and laughed through the video.So in a nutshell, see it if you haven't before. You will love it, or better yet get it for someone you know hasn't seen it. It's a classic."
1,Getting Started with ArcIMS,Save your money. You can find better information for free on the internet. As soon as I opened the package I decided to return the book.
1,Don't waste your money or time,"I read the previous review and ordered the book anyway. What a mistake. I returned the book as soon as I opened it. If you have the software you probably have this book on your CDs. I repeat, don't waste your time or money."
2,New Chicane Album,"I'm not too impressed with this album. There are a few very enjoyable songs, but I have Behind the Sun as well and like that album much more. I did hear that Chicane was a little rushed while making Somersault, but it's still just not as good as I thought and hoped it would be."
3,"Better than ""Easy to Assemble"", but nothing like the early stuff","A lot of people are expressing disappointment with this album - I am guessing most of them haven't heard ""Easy to Assemble"" (an album that seems to have sunk with barely a trace). If you had, you would not be surprised that Chicane is much more pop electronica now than the atmospheric stuff from the 1990's. And you would probably be much happier with Somersault, which is a much better album than the atrocious Easy to Assemble, that I could only ever bring myself to listen to once through. Somersault, on the other hand, I quite enjoy. By most standards its a good album that only pales when compared with what Chicane used to do."
2,Can't believe it,"I've been a long-time Chicane fan and this album is sadly a disappointment. I'm not against vocals on his tracks as evidenced by songs such as Autumn Tactics and Strong In Love, Saltwater and even Love on the Run, but the vocals on this album are truly subpar. I was really hoping for more instrumental tracks like Arizona and Time of Your Life. Even when categorized as Euro-pop, this album is album is mediocre. Save your money and download the two tracks mentioned above from iTunes."
1,"BLAND, INSIPID, EURO-POP CHEEZ","Are a few of the words which spring to mind after hearing this utter disappointment of an album... Chicane faithful hoping for the sonic glory of 'Far From the maddening Crowds' and 'Behind the Sun' will be outraged at this pop/rock/dance dross...Nick, what happened?"
3,Shockingly disappointing...only one track is worth the listening time...,"This album is a letdown. The only redeeming track would be ""Turning Corners"". I had this album fly 1/2 way round the world only to listen to tracks that do not even come a mile close to the previous releases.Verdict: DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!"
5,Instant whiteness!,My teeth were whiter after one use and it so far has caused no sensitivity to my teeth or gums. Great product!
3,Like any other toothpaste,The product does not do what it claims to do. My teeth are not getting any whiter. I will not order again.
3,Brite is Correct!!!,I have noticed a difference using this toothpaste. It does reduce the yellow stain look but it doesn't whiten the teeth. My teeth look less yellow but still haven't seen it go any further than where it's at. I've used it for a couple of weeks now. Good toothpaste to brighten but not whiten.
3,Toothpaste - BriteSmile,"BriteSmile toothpaste arrive as promised. Product ""seems"" to be as expected tho active ingredient listed on previous tube ""Sodium Monofluorophosphphate"" has now been changed to ""Sodium Fluoride"" on this new tube. Don't know what this change means but I hope it does not change the effectiveness of this ""expensive"" whitening toothpaste. Seems a bit too expensive to me."
1,This book has many mistakes on the answers it provides.,"This book does not explain the answers. Worst, a lot of the answers could not possibly be correct because they don't make any sense!!! Time is of the essence, do not waste it using this book!"
5,"Great Product, Gret Price","I tried to buy this ladder(Werner 17 foot) at Home Depot and Lowes because I neeed it right away to get up on my roof and shovel off 2 feet of snow but they did't have this size. Their websites were asking $40 more plus shippig and I would have to wait 2 weeks for delivery. I received this ladder in about 3 days and it's a great ladder. Well engineered and manufatured with no problems. It folds up to a small package for easy storage. I'm very happy with my purchase as regards product qualiy, purchase price and delivery."
5,Feel very safe using this brand of ladder,"We purchased the 13' Werner last fall and love it. Both my wife and I feelvery secure using it, it's steady, fairly light weight to move around andhas sure footing. Glad we bought it, would recommend if your looking for asolid product!"
4,Pretty good little ladder,"This ladder is light and portable. Fairly easy to finagle into its different positions. Not quite as tall as I had been hoping, but the height is clearly displayed in the description so that's my bad.Mostly we've been using this ladder to paint the trim around the windows outside. And it's doing a good job there.But the main reason we wanted to buy it was because we could use it to paint the wall next to the stairs in our house. Thanks to being able to position the different sides of the ladder to different lengths, we should be able to use this ladder on the stairs and paint the wall on even footing. It's a tricky area to paint and not having a ladder that could accommodate the stairs has held us back on the painting.I would recommend this product to a do it yourself-er who isn't interested in learning to bench press in order to move a ladder around."
4,great versatile ladder,"Nice long reach, long enough to reach the top of my 2nd level window. It is a bit on the heavy side to move around. I am glad I did not get the longer ladder."
5,Great Item,Pro: Really stable! Multi purpose ladders. Adjustable and make it easy to store and high enough to reach everywhere.Con: It might be too heavy for one person to carry.
3,"Decent multifunctional ladder, but actual height of MT-26 is 22 feet","The MT-26 is a good multifunction ladder - I've used it as a stairway ladder, scaffold, and extension ladder, and it works well for these purposes. It is quite heavy, but fairly compact when fully folded. As other reviewers have stated, as an extension ladder, is it difficult to extend while in the vertical position because of the weight. One thing I wanted to bring up (as I didn't' see it mentioned in other reviews) is that the actual height of the ladder in extension ladder mode is 22 feet, not 26 feet. The 26 feet length is the average ""reach"" for a 5'6"" standing on the ladder when it is extended to it's maximum 22' length. It does clearly state that on the the packaging, but not in the item description on Amazon's website. As a result of the 22' height, it barely works for one of my purposes, which was to reach a rooftop that is 20' up."
4,Good one.,"I use it mainly for indoor purposes. It definitely does the job, although when fully extended it is wobbly at the top. Also, the extending mechanism could be smoother, it gets stuck sometimes."
5,The Perfect Homeowner's Ladder,"After years of using the convention extension ladder, I decided to buy the MT-17 from Amazon. Wow, this is a seriously well-built ladder that is easy to set up in a number of different configurations. It works great as a step ladder with extendible legs, or as a fully open extension ladder. Made the gutter cleaning work on the single story garage and the two story house a snap. I really like the locking mechanisms, they are very solid. I did mark the UNLOCKED and LOCKED positions with red and blue Sharpie, just to make things clear at a glance. I did pick up the standing platform AC-18MT to give a more secure stance when using a power washer on the ladder and it works nicely. So all in all, a very nice ladder that folds into a compact form for storage in your garage, and a ladder that will take the place of the usual quiver of stepladders and extension ladders typically used by homeowners."
3,Defective Ladder - Unsafe!,On the very first day of use one of the cross-beam's (support-arm's) rivots snapped off for no apparent reason. I am now concerned that the ladder is unsafe to stand on. I submitted a replacement request to Amazon to have a new one shipped to me.
4,"Heavier than Suggested by Reviews and Advertising, Otherwise great Ladder","Since there have been so many reviews of this ladder, the only thing I will add is that it is definitely heavier than what is suggested by the advertising and by some reviews, and perhaps heavier than necessary. Because of it's aluminum looking body I assumed that it would be lighter than it actually is. While I can carry this ladder around by myself (the 22 foot model), it's definitely heavy and if judging it by appearance, I would say to view this more as a steel object in terms of weight than aluminum. Otherwise, this ladder is rock-solid and well designed."
3,Pleased with Werner Ladder,"It does a great job. However, it is very heavy for me to move since I aman old lady. I would say the stair phase is super, which is why I purchased it"
5,Surprisingly tall,"I wanted to get a 24 foot extension ladder, but couldn't pass up the price tag on this ladder. I was terrified that it wouldn't reach my 2nd story gutters, but it made it and the ladder wasn't even fully extended. I was pleasantly surprised, and extremely happy.And of course, I don't have to take up backyard space storing it, as it folds nicely for storage!"
5,Exceeded expectations,Bought this for my husband on a lightening deal and was even more blown away with the deal I got one we received it! It can be used in so many ways which is perfect for his business. It is very heavy duty and extremely versatile!
5,Love it!,"I love this ladder. I use it for everything! it comes apart into 2 pieces so you can use it as sawhorse or scaffolding. I do wish i got the bigger one now, BUT this one is great!"
2,Not as easy to use as you may think,"This ladder is very heavy and is difficult for one person to handle. You really need two people to adjust this ladder to various heights. Because of its weight, I would not recommend using indoor because it can damage the furniture or walls while carrying it around or changing to various height. The locks are very hard and get jammed making it difficult to fold it.It is very solid and sturdy and could be very useful for outdoor use and for construction workers. An average person will find it difficult to use it due to its weight. Elderly people should never buy this - too heavy for them.I returned this product because for a work of 5 minutes I had to struggle 20 minutes to adjust height and the locks got jammed."
3,"Not 13' tall, but still nice.","Great ladder, but it's only about 10 feet tall max, not 13. I'm not sure how they're measuring up to 13' (??) - still and excellent quality ladder for a great price, though."
4,Great multi-purpose ladder,"I needed a ladder to clean out the gutters of my house. Living in Pennsylvania, my house isn't on level ground, so this ladder (MT-17) worked perfectly for the job, I was able to use it as a large step ladder for one side of the house (which felt very secure), and as an extension ladder for the other side of the house which is much higher. The only downside of the ladder is that it is quite heavy. Massive upside of course is that it folds down to a size small enough to move it around in my Honda Fit, something no extension ladder would be capable of."
4,"Not for use ""in"" the home","I purchased this ladder as a multi-use ladder, both inside the home for routine things, as well as outside for getting as high as the second story. The ladder does exactly what it is advertised as doing and does it at a much better price than the little giant. It has a very nice design.However, it is large and pretty heavy for use around the house. I would recommend getting one of these for garage use and outside use and purchasing a smaller lighter fiberglass ladder for ""in"" home use."
3,Too Heavy - Its a job alone just to move it.,The average woman cannot lift this ladder. I am 5'6 and 120lbs I have to drag it in order to get it anywhere. Once it is there it works great. I would only suggest this product for the heavy worker and not the average home-owner. Look at a fiber-glass ladder instead.
5,Worth every penny,"I was skeptical at first about these telescoping ladders until the Home Inspector pulled one out of the back seat of his car when inspecting my new home. He was able to use it for just about everything including getting on the roof of the second story (although he had to first climb up the 1st floor garage roof and then pull it up.) I made the decision then to purchase one and haven't been disappointed. Works well indoors and out, has a sturdy base, and is simple to setup in different positions. My only complaint is that the narrow steps hurt my feet after a while even with shoes on. However this is after extended periods on it and the narrow steps have to be expected for telescoping. Would absolutely recommend."
4,great multipurpose - its on sale at the big box stores,"I have the gorilla MT-17 clone from Home Depot ($80 during black Friday) and just picked this ladder up at Lowes for $150. I even made the manager confirm that was the right price! First off most of the add-ons for the Gorrilla don't work that well on the Werner, but since you really don't need the hinge kit for the werner like you do for the Gorilla, that is not a problem. Second there is not that much of an advantage to the Werner, its really only a few feet larger that the Gorilla, is much heavier, and is more expensive to outfit with extras. All in all I should have stuck with the smaller ladder and would ask most shoppers to decide if they really need the extra few feet for double the cost.Can confirm that as of this writing the cost of this ladder is $149 at both Lowes and Home Depot, a great deal!"
5,A bargain for $175 delivered,"This ladder rocks. If you have a 10 year old folding ladder, get rid of it and buy this one. It is rock steady (and I weigh 250lbs). Easy to use, folds well, easy to configure asymetrically. My local Home Depot had this ladder for $190 plus tax. For 25-30 dollars less, Amazon delivered in several days. This is a first class product."
2,Disillusioned,"I purchased a 22ft ladder to use in painting a 25ft high ceiling.The ladder actually measures 20ft when fully extended. You should not use the top rung, so you can only climb 19th.Why does Werner say it is a 22ft ladder when the above applies.Future buyers would be advised to call the company & ask specific questions before they but anything from Werner.I am now stuck with an expensive ladder that I cannot use to do what I need."
5,Cool ladder,"Bought this ladder to replace two ladders i lost in a fire. Pro adaptable can be used on several different types of jobs. Con kinda heavy,but opens up to 22 feet."
3,Very awkward as extension ladder,"As an extension ladder, it is very awkward. Even when only extended to 15 feet, ""walking"" the ladder upright is *very* difficult, even with a second person. If you need to go higher than 15 feet, get a dedicated extension ladder.Another (more minor nitpick): When I got it, it was covered in metal shavings. I got a metal splinter in my finger. When you first open it, wipe it down!"
4,"Satisfied, but not amazed","I have had this ladder for about 10 days and am using it as I paint the exterior of my house. It is very stable in A-frame mode, though the rungs can be a little uncomfortable as you extend the height. (The inner and outer rings provide a wider support for your foot when at shorter lengths.)As an extension ladder there was more flex than I was expecting. This ladder isn't as easy to adjust as the Little Giant infomercial would suggest. It comes with much nicer castings for use in scaffolding mode than the knock-off available at home depot. Not clear to me if there are any other differences. I also have been very happy with the stability of the outside wider scaffolding (when the ladder is broken apart into two samll A-frames)."
5,Great Ladder for Great Price,"I was initially considering the Little Giant, but the $400 price tag is too much in my opinion for something you may use a handful of times throughout the year, unless you work in construction or something. For regular homeowners the Werner MT-22 should be more than sufficient. I received mine the other day and after some getting used to, the ladder works like a charm. BE WARNED...the ladder is heavy, but when you are up as high as this ladder goes you don't want something flimsy do you? It does fold down to a manageable size to move around however. Also remember to wear gloves using this ladder for safety reasons and to keep your hands clean. I don't consider this ladder a cheap knockoff, but a great ladder from a solid company.I paid $155 for it through Amazon and the LG costs approx. $400. I saved nearly $250 with the Werner. All in all, i still wish i could afford the LG, but the MADE IN AMERICA price tag outweighs my PAID IN AMERICA salary!"
5,Buy this!,"WOW! This Ladder is awesome, and so far its pretty darn sturdy. I bought this for a all around multi use ladder and for the price, I am shocked at how well this thing holds up. It's made with strong metal, and locks into place a variety of different positions. The only downside it that its heavy. But surly a good deal and worth its weight."
5,my first ladder purchase ever,"i have not had the need to ever purchase a ladder in over 50 yrs until now. As a female whose experience with ladders has been only a step stool i was kinda worried i would not be able to lift this ladder or figure out the mechanics of it. I ordered it on a friday night , it arrived on monday evening. i read the instructions in 5 minutes and put it up and used it to change a battery in the ever beeping low battery indicator on the fire alarm on a cathedral ceiling. Now I have a ladder and i am very happy with the delivery and the ease of using the ladder."
4,Good compact ladder,"This ladder is compact for its size - a good feature. I wish that the rungs on the ladder were a bit more flat so you could get a better grip with your foot, but it's still a good ladder. It's handy that you can move this ladder around and use it at different heights. It's not that heavy either, but still is sturdy. I think it's a good buy for the money."
1,multi-ladder,"wasn't clear that it couldn't be used as 2 separate ladders. Also, it is heavier than expected. the instructions for us are also not clear."
3,Good ladder but heavy,All of these multi function ladders are very versatile and compact for storage but come with a draw back. They are heavy. Given that it is extremely stable compared to standard ladders. Does take the place of multiple ladders. Bought it because I needed a ladder that could be used on stairs.Good ladder but if going to use it every day you will get a work out.
3,Versatile and compact for storage but heavy (42 lbs) to use,"I bought this ladder as my other 6-ft step ladder was not long enough for many uses. This ladder is very compact for storage and is very versatile in terms of various heights and angles. However, be cautioned that it is extremely heavy for a ladder. I am a healthy man in my 40's and I found it inconvenient to move it around and use it due to its weight. Unfortunately one has to deal with all the weight even if using as a step-ladder (about 8-9 feet). Overall, I bought it because I liked the concept but now don't really like to use it due to this concern. I wish they would come up with a better design to reduce the weight without any compromises."
3,Hard to Handle at First -Great as a stepladder and to Store,"Takes some getting used to-you basically fight gravity manuevering this thing. It stores great and is an extra steady step ladder, but unless you are 6 ft tall it is hard to adjust and position as an extension ladder."
5,Good Ladder!,"Great ladder. Very solid with good workmanship. I'm 65 and I have trouble working with my fingers due to arthritis. I was concerned that the latches would be hard for me to manage, but they work very smoothly and take little effort to set the ladder to the length and configuration needed. Highly recommended!"
5,Love the ladder,Great ladder and sturdy ! I actually bought the little giant ladder at Costco and returned it because it felt unstable. Once I purchased the Warner ladder and received it in 3 days it felt so sturdy compared to the little giant .. I rather have quality and sturdiness then having a lite ladder
4,Works well but usefulness limited by weight,"I bought this because I needed a ladder with a greater reach than the 8-foot fiberglass step ladder I was using. I indeed got the reach I was looking for, but found the ladder to be so heavy that I long for the fiberglass one I gave away when the job does not require the extra reach.Outside of the weight, the ladder mechanism works well, and you feel safe using it, as it is quite sturdy/wobble free."
4,Good step ladder. Heavy and hard to handle extension ladder.,This ladder is great for the step ladder function. However it is very heavy to move around. Other than it being very heavy it is a great ladder and comes in handy because it becomes a very tall step ladder that can be accessed from both sides. As far as using it as an extension ladder it is heavy to move and really hard to get it upright.
2,Not so great,"This ladder is suppose to be the last ladder you buy...A Frame Ladder:Works well as an A frame ladder. It's sturdier than one sided A frame ladder and you have the option of extending the ladder.Extension Ladder:You can't extend the ladder while leaning against a building like a typical extension ladder. You must lay it out on your lawn and then lift it up. This is a close to impossible if your by your self. Rather cumbersome.Scaffold:I wouldn't trust these joints. These joints just slide in and are not secured.After buying this ladder, I bought an real extension ladder. To make a scaffold, I use this ladder and another A frame ladder. I would consider this 3 in 1 ladder a 1.5 ladder. It an extendable A frame ladder at best."
1,Jack of all Master of one,"However clever this ladder is, it is not. For example as an extension ladder it performs poorly. It's major flaw is you can not raise it like an extension ladder. There is no rope to pull it up, so you have to lay it down and extend it then raise it back up. By the way, 50 pounds is not much when compacted, but at 17 feet it weighs much more. The best use of this ladder is for replacing the lamp in the stairwell. As a step ladder it works, but the steps are only 2 inches deep as compared to a regular step ladder where the steps are 3 inches deep. This is much easier on your feet. The bottom line is: Buy this ladder if you need to replace lamps in stairwells or you have small storage, it does store quite small.BTW: I am selling my ladder for cheep at the local garage sale ;-)Tim"
3,The picture is wrong,"Do not get me wrong.The ladder itself is a terrific ladder, versatile and easy to maneuver.It is not the lightest of ladders if that is a concern. But it beats buying several different fiberglass ladders to do the same thing.My problem is with the picture. When buying things on-line, since you can not touch the item, one relies on the picture shown.I purchased the MT-17 for a customer based on the picture. However when I received the ladder, I discovered that the ladder pictured was the MT-21.Fortunately the customer was satisfied with the shorter ladder, saving me the hassle, time and expense of returning and exchanging the ladder."
3,"Decent ladder for money, Made in China and it shows.",The ladder is well designed for its intended use. The packaging is reasonable and the shipping time and cost is good.I found some of the the rivets to be lose and one in particular has fallen off. The one that fell off is not on a critical element but I have noticed that some rivets are more solidly fastened than others.
2,Poorly built ladder - and cheaper at Home Depot,"This was bought through Amazon as gift for me. It arrived as expected and in ""perfect"" condition. Unfortunately, the very first day I used it on a roofing project, one of the rivets that connects one of the stabilizing cross-arms snapped off for no reason. I stopped using it immediately and went back to my old extension ladder. I will return it for a replacement and see if the second one is of better quality/craftsmanship. (BTW... you can buy this at Home Depot for $159.00, but you will have to pay the tax and transport the ladder back home - it's REALLY heavy.)"
5,Air Conditioning Saleman's Dream Ladder,I too purchased this ladder at Costco for just under $100. I am in commercial air conditioning sales that requires a ladder from time to time to get on to roofs (extension ladder) as well as into ceilings (step ladder). One small problem with having conventional ladders; I drive a '99 Buick LaSabre. This ladder is perfect! It just fits across my back seat and provides me with the versatility of having all of these easily adjustable ladders in one conveniant package. In fact today I used it in both the 7 foot step ladder as well as the fully extension mode at the same site. It is very well made and easy to adjust. This ladder is perfect me.
5,Well worth the money,"We use a Little-Giant ladder in our fire department. I wanted one for home use, but was not willing to pay what they were getting for a Little Giant. I chose the Warner ladder because they are one of the largest ladder manufacturers, and make a good product. I was not disappointed. It's every bit as good, and a lot less expensive. Warning, ladders of this type are very heavy which is what makes them so sturdy and universal"
4,Versitile Verticals,Nice ladder. Gets me up. Gets me down. Bought it for exterior upkeep but find it useful in the house and orchard.
3,Telescoping MultiLadder,"The ladder is durable but very heavy. The step ladder is great to use and the double sided feature is a plus. All the adjustable heights are super for many projects around the house however when using the full extension of the ladder it is too heavy for 1 person to put into place. Unlike other extension ladders that have a rope to assist raising it and allow you to place the ladder where it belongs and then extend it, the Telescoping MultiLadder must be extended prior to placing it. Once fully extended the weight of the ladder is just too heavy and very difficult to maneuver."
4,Great ladder,"I just received this new ladder. It feels great, heavy duty it seems. It was very easy to configure it to the desired height and to engage the locking mechanisms of the ladder. When climbing it feels very stable until you reach one step below the ""maximum safe climbing"". This ladder has a maximum of 8 climbable (safe) steps when used in a step ladder configuration. But I feel the 8th step to be less stable. It does not feel as secure.So far, my only complaint is that the steps are too thin. Your really need a hard sole shoe to climb this ladder. The with of the steps is about 1""."
5,"Great Ladder, Great Price","This ladder is easy to adjust, has a sturdy frame and can be transported in my mini van. I have seen famous brand ladders advertised on TV for a lot more money and this ladder does the same things as the more well known, as seen on TV, ladders. This was a great find for me and my small business."
5,Great ladder,Easy to handle and fits in my trunk. Love it . Arrived quickly. It was great to use this for Christmas decorating.
4,Absolutely Amazing!,"What an unbelievable deal! I got an estimate from my local ace store on the same ladder for $[...] with shipping. Ladder came assembled with a comprehensive owners manual showing all the different configurations the ladder can be changed into. This holds me (260#) and my brother-in-law (175#) together with no problems.This is a heavy ladder so it requires 2 people to move it and set it up. Also, This ladder is tall! Got it all the way to the top eave of my house with room to spare.I only gave it four stars because the rungs are a bit narrow width-wise, but overall it is a great and sturdy ladder. Did I mention it is considerably cheaper than the Little Giant? I would definitely by this product again with confidence."
4,works great,"I think this ladder works great. Extremely versatile, not too, too heavy, and easy, stable locking mechanisms. Able to be manipulated with just one person fairly easily."
5,Well worth it,"I've been interested in this type of ladder for a number of years, saw a demonstration of Costco's version, but never had any real excuse to buy one - until I had to paint the stairway and forgot how I managed to do it last time around. I had set up some type of scaffold, but didn't have a satisfactory solution this time, so instead of beating my brains out - and for less than what some people blow at the casinos in less than a minute - I decided to get this one from Amazon. It cost less than in the big box stores and got here in good shape two days after I ordered. It was a breeze to set up - and yes, you do have to be careful about handling it when extending the sections - and made a tough job very easy. Great ladder. Extremely well made and at an affordable price. Absolutely Fabulous! AB FAB!"
4,Tall Compact Ladder,"Well built solid ladder in a compact design. Be aware that when fully extended (as ladder), it becomes very difficult to handle as you will have on average 18-ft of ladder beyond your grasp (when lifting from the ground into position). Two people can manipulate it easier."
5,Great Ladder very stable,"I have an older Werner ladder that is the typical width (about 15inches) and even with a stabilizer bar at the bottom it made me nervous.This ladder can not only go higher but I feel very stable when I'm at the top.I've only used it as a step ladder to reach the ceiling in my house (14' 6"" high) and I'm able to do that with ease, I'm 5'9"". I can touch my head to the ceiling now. I had tried the MT-22 for this but found I was about 10"" short of the peak on the ceiling for the extra $ this ladder was worth it.I also like how each side can adjust by 1 foot independent of each other. My other ladders hinged at the sections and was very limiting for how you can use it. This ladder makes positioning it on stairs much easier and in my opinion safer."
4,Great ladder,"What an incredible Deal of the day!Ladder works great. Remember this is a 22 foot extension ladder so it is fairly heavy. It is intuitive and easy to operate, however because it is fairly large and heavy it took a little thinking of how to open/close, and extend/retract; that is to say where to stand and how to hold the ladder to make it quick and easy to operate it.The only thing that seemed a little odd is how you connect the two removable extension pieces to make the second small ladder/scaffold. These two extension pieces are hooked together with the extension locks. This works just fine, I guess I was just expecting something more complicated."
3,Great ladder IF you only have one,"This is a great ladder if you only are going to buy one ladder, and use it once every month or two. It is versatile, and strong with a 1A rating.I gave it only three stars because it's heavy; at thirty five pounds its ten pounds heaver than the 13' little giant. And weight it a big issue if you're lugging a ladder around often with one hand as your holding something in the other. Another problem is the steps are narrow and uncomfortable if you're on a ladder a lot. Plus there's no top shelf to place tools, like on a normal stepladder.The real positive for this ladder is its ability to be placed on stairs, which no other ladder can do. And that's the reason I bought this ladder.I've used this ladder now for a couple of years and find it to be very stable, it doesn't walk away like normal step ladders.Also the ability to go up or down either side and stradle the thing are features I've learned to enjoy."
5,Perfect for Small Spaces,"This is a perfect ladder for those needing reach from small spaces. Many buildings have attic access in closets, or above stairwells, where it is difficult to position a normal ladder. It is easy to get this ladder in and setup without tearing up walls, setting up staging, or having to move a lot of junk. Another benefit to its compact size is that it will fit in the back of my little GMC Jimmy. With the price of fuel today, it's nice to not need my ton diesel pickup to haul ladders around to estimate small jobs.As others have mentioned, this little workhorse is a bit heavy, but it is heavy-duty (commercially rated) equipment. The average homeowner doesn't need to buy tools rated to this standard."
4,Good ladder at a great price.,This ladder is very well built and is useful in many applications around the house. Only down side is that it is very heavy. Keep a short lighter one around for small jobs.
3,Toolman,"I purchased this ladder for the capability to use it in a tall stairway, and for the use with scafolding. I have the same looking scafolding as in the picture on the sale page, however the ladder rails are 1/4"" too narrow, so it won't work. The extra braces for setting up the scafolding with the ladder part that separates from the main ladder won't stay in the groove of the rail. They're not made very well to fit where they should, and I shouldn't have to modify them to make it work. On a positive note the ladder is useful otherwise."
4,"werner,multiladder-22'","have not used it yet, it's our rain season. looks tke same as ""little giant"" but at half the price. it'l get a workout this spring, am thourally satisfied"
1,Be Advised,I had this ladder for a couple of years snapped in half while i was 16 ft in the airfell on my back to a concrete slabBroke my back ribs shoulder do not consider just price do not risk your life on this
1,cheaper at home depot,Haven't really used this ladder yet because I am not up to the painting stage of my home redo.Looks to be exactly what I require for the job.After going to Home Depot I found this exact ladder for 168.00 and this was not a sale price. Amazon does not do price match so looks like I'm stuck for 41.00.Next time I'll do a little more homework
1,Much too flexible,"Quivers like a trampoline while climbing or descending. Very disturbing. As others have said, there are dangers and difficulties extending it when using it in ""Extension"" mode. Heavy. I would not have bought it had I used it first and can not recommend it. I wish I had got a simple extension instead. Does NOT convert to two scaffold bases, that is an outright lie."
1,Werner ladder,The description for this ladder is a little deceiving - stating it is a 17' - when the picture shows an A frame.
1,Not Amazing Ladder,"Using as an extention ladder, you need two persons to operate. When the upper portion of the ladder is coming down, watch your fingers. It is painful and I will never want to do that again. It is too heavy to carry around. The Little Giant leg leveler, $29.99, did not work on this ladder. You have to buy their Werner leg leveler, over $100, to fit. To install, you have to drill holes into the ladder. Otherwise, it is a good ladder to have at home."
5,Great ladder,"I wanted a ladder that gave me the versatility of the Little Giant, but without the high $$$. I'll admit, this ladder is a little bit heavy and could be slightly difficult for some to lug around, but other than the weight, it's a great ladder. It's very sturdy and high quality. Everyone who has come by my house and seen the ladder has remarked on how it's exactly what they need as well. I think I should get some kind of commission from Werner! I would recommend this to anyone."
2,I should have done more research,"When I received it it was left outside when no one was home ,lucky no one took it.And one of the latches that holds the ladder from moving has the plastic latch cracked.I also found it hard to operate.I also found it cheaper locally days after I bought this one.I would have been better off buying a 17 ' extension ladder."
4,Handy Homeowner's Ladder,"This is a great and very versatile ladder at a reasonable price. Our old wooden ladder finally disintegrated, so I shopped around looking for a better replacement. The only criticism I have is that it's a bit heavy. Shortly after arrival, my husband cleaned out the gutters."
5,Great Tool - Good price,"Roof work, tree-trimming, siding repair. This little guy did it all. Just over 2 months of intense summer work and I am still very, very happy that I went with this one.A word of caution, as with all ladders, watch your fingers and arms."
4,Good Ladder,"Sturdy ladder performs as advertised for a reasonable price. Easy to adjust. Maybe consider buying a tray for the top of it, though..."
5,It does it all,"This ladder is the perfect height, the perfect step ladder and anything else that you could possibly use it for....and it's light and easy to use at a great price"
4,Excellent ladder-not too heavy,This was the first ladder I ever bought and I think it's flat out great. It's 'unfolding' design make it universal in length and height. Easy to open and close...I recommend silicone spray on the tracks to free it up even more.Not sure why people complain about the weight...its a 22 foot METAL ladder not a step stool(!) I'm an average sized guy and I have no problem putting it over my shoulder and walking it across the yard.
4,Good unit,"Unit is heavy, making it harder to move around, but is very sturdy and meets all other expectations. I would recommend this unit to anyone needing a versatile ladder."
5,Great all purpose ladder,I replaced my old 16 ft. ladder and 6 ft. step ladder with this. Luckily I got it on sale before the price went up but even at the current price its a good deal. So many configurations and it only took me about 5 minutes to figure out how the change it into the various positions. I love that it can be a 9 ft. step ladder. The ladder is not too heavy at about 45 pounds and can be carried easily by someone of average strength. Should last a long time. Not sure why anyone would spend 200 more for the little giant when this seems like essentially the same ladder.
5,great ladder,i would recomend this for any one its great for in home or out side use we have had a smaller one for years and its still in great shape
5,Best ladder we have.,"This is our new favorite ladder. So sturdy... so much sturdier than any of those wooden ""A"" frames we used to have. I don't feel at all nervous on this one. You can use it as an ""A"" frame or as an extension ladder. It is quite versatile. I also like that it folds to a relatively small size for storage in your garage. It's sort of heavy to lug around compared to the old wooden style ladder or even some aluminum ladders but... it's just so worth it because of it's stability and it's ability to transform into different styles of ladder."
4,Love the Ladder,"Love the Ladder, Not the price. $60 less at my local home center.Should of would of could of's don't count."
4,A GOOD CLIMB,"Have been a homeowner for many years now.Have only owned a 6' step ladder.The time finally came for the need of an extension ladder.Decided to go for the best bang for the buck.I purchased the Werner Multi-Ladder after doing some reserch comparing quality,functionality, and price.This ladder is easy to handle in regard to setting it up for any of the ladder types needed.I have used it several times by myself and have felt safe and comfortable.So far I am happy to recommend this ladder."
4,Werner MT-13 300-Pound Telescoping Ladder,So far I have found this ladder completely satisfactory and equivalent to the very similar Gorilla(TM) ladder that I had with my previous company. The only complaint that I have (and I think this is a very minor one) is that the hinge has more play in it than the Gorilla (TM). It telescopes more smoothly than my previous ladder which always seemed to catch at one point when telescoping. I can very definitely recommend this product.
4,"Good, but a bit heavy","The ladder is a bit heavy for easily moving here and there (upstairs, outside, etc.) as I had hoped to do. Before I purchased it, I tried to find a lighter-weight version but did not find one. I really wanted the functionality offered but in a lighter version (since I don't need the 300 lb rating). I don't use it as often as I would if it was lighter in weight.Other than being a bit too heavy, the actual functionality of the unit is very nice. I am now able to reach places (like our curved stairway) that I could never reach before. The ability to raise one side while keeping the other side the same height makes it wonderful for slopes. The wide bottom gives it great stability. It is easy to adjust and very flexible.I would definitely recommend this unit to others."
3,Good Product,A bit heavy and shaky in full extension but other than that good product. I would recommend this product to anyone
3,"Great tall ladder, for those high reaches","Since the ladder reaches waaay up there, it is heavy. When the ladder is fully stretched, standing on its just two legs and resting against the wall, it does get scary. Maybe because I don't climb such heights on ladders everyday, I was uncomfortable and did not have a solid sense of safety. I felt that it was a bit wobbly. If I had to do it again, I would buy an extension ladder, not the folding type."
3,Just ok,"Heavy, not what I expected, only 5 ft tall, would not buy it again, would want one lighter and more flexible"
4,Good Ladder for the Price,"This ladder is very easy to use and pretty light to carry. I just wish it was a couple feet bigger. When I thought thirteen feet I thoght that would be plenty to reach my gutters, I forgot about the hill but then it still was tall enough for me to get on the roof."
4,ladder,"The ladder does everything that I need, The step ladder part is great for the thing I need too do. The fully extended straight ladder is a little shakey but I also weight 260LB.Over all is every thing I need.Compact so it fits in my truck. The ladder is a bit heavy but a good all around ladder"
5,Ultimate ladder,My best friend introduced me to The Little Giant ladder which he had for the last few years. I researched and found the ladder pattent had expired and others were doing it now. The best and closest to little giant ladder was this one. In my opinion it's exactly the same. This ladder rocks and it's more than 100 bucks cheaper than LG ladder . Awesome stuff.
4,Great ladder,"If you're looking for a multi-purpose ladder that can get you anywhere, this is it. The only drawback is that it is pretty heavy. It's still managable on your own in the ""A"" frame position... but, you definitely need two people for the extension ladder position (or you'll have to extend the ladder in a very unsafe way). But, I would recommend this ladder or the MT-22 (if you don't need a lot of height)... the other MT series ladders that are smaller just aren't worth the price."
4,Werner Multi-Ladder,"The Werner Multi-Ladder servers the purpose, which I was looking for in a ladder. It allows me to have the convenience of multiple step ladders and extension ladders in one package. The MT-22 allows me to easily reach the ceilings of my 9', 10' and 12' ceilings in the house. It is sturdy and well buiit. The only caution is that it is quite heavy compared to a single aluminum step ladder. An older customer may find it too heavy to move around."
5,Best Ladder Ever,"The 22' ladder made easy for my Christmas lights hanging this year. It's so simple to extend and fold the ladder as if I am doing magic. It's actually dummy proof. I felt secure when stepping on it. Its locking device is very secure and easy to operate simply pull the hinge out, set the position, and done. The 22' length enables me to clime up the roof easy and I was able to fix the leak before the rain come and the saving already pay for the ladder. Because it is very strong, it's not light to carry compare to the 6' ladder I have. But there's no trade off for its multiple functions. It's a great investment."
4,Werner 22 foot,Nothing to add over other reviews. I have had this ladder for some time. It is a bit on the heavy side but then again it is very sturdy. It folds into a compact size and while it take more time than some ladders to get set up it replaces many of them. I keep a small four foot for quick indoor jobs but the 6 foot and 13 foot ladders went away and are placed by this one. I too saw the Little Giant Ladder on TV but did not want to pay the premium they charge for it. This is a very good option. Buy the height you need and not the largest one unless you need it as the design does add weight but makes it versatile and sturdy.
4,Good deal,"Yes, it is heavy but it feels very safe. You don't feel wobbly and for someone with two bad knees and hips I felt safe climbing same. I wish the steps itself were wider, but a good pair of sturdy sneakers helps.Also the price was excellent in comparison to the little giant."
5,Great ladder,"Basically this is the same as a ""little giant"" ladder at roughly half the price.Amazon's price is inline with what I have seen in the big box home improvement stores but it would not have been easy for me to get a ladder home in either one of my sedans. The super saver shipping made this a sure fire deal what would put this great ladder on my doorstep for the same price as the home improvement stores without trying to figure out how to get it home."
3,On The Heavy Side,"This is a well made ladder, very sturdy. However, if one is going to turn it into an extension of any appreciable length one better get some help to stand it up. This thing is a monster to try to handle yourself. I needed a 26ft ladder to do some work on my house, I couldn't stand it up, this thing was just too heavy and unwieldy. I borrowed my neighbors extension ladder. Don't let anyone fool you, this thing is not as easy to use as a regular extension ladder and a heck of alot heavier. Hope I can move it at my garage sale next year."
4,ladder is awesome,I bought this ladder to have for my business. But I ended up bringing it home to do some painting on vaulted walls. Wow I felt very secure and safe being home alone to do this project. Only down side is it is quite heavy and a bit cumbersome to set up. But worth the effort.
3,Great ladder but very heavy,"This is a first rate quality ladder that can be configured for all kinds of situations and it works great. However, I don't use it as much as I thought I would because it is really heavy for a ladder. I only use it when I have another person handy to help me get it set up."
5,Great Ladder,"This a great and verstile ladder. It adjusts easily and is very sturdy feeling while on it. Price and shipping was very good, highly recommend for the DIY homeowner and professional user."
4,The Good and the Bad,"The Good:1. It's small & relatively easy to store2. It's safe & sturdy, I feel comfortable on the ladderThe Bad:1. It's heavy (I bought the 17'). It's not so heavy when you first pick it up but when it's extended it can be difficult to easily move around.2. It's hard to use in small places, if you need to extend it you need plenty of floor space in the same area, you can't easily move it when it's extended.3. The black end caps will mark up walls, put an old towel over the end caps but that can be a clumsy operation. If you do get marks on the wall use one of those stain erase sponges.My conclusion:A regular extension ladder is much easier to use but this ladder does have more functions. Don't be in a rush, think before you climb & have a helper if possible."
4,Love this ladder,"First, it's long enough for me to get to the top of the Walsh for painting. It is light enough for me to easily move. And it is short enough to fit in the bed of our truck."
5,latter,Sturdy latter. A brand I trust. recommend to everybody. Tall enough to reach just about everything you need to get to safely.
3,A BIT HEAVY,"It will take two people to comfortably and safely maneuver this to the work area. Also, extra hands are most helpful to open and adjust this to the desired setting. It really is heavier than anticipated."
4,"Works great, but is really heavy","I think I should have ordered the the 17' instead of the 22'. The 22' is just too heavy for me to lug around .. it's hard to maneuver and get up steps. I'm probably average size, and I'm guessing this is built for handymen or construction people with a bit more bulk. At the time the 17' and 22' were both $164, so I figured why not?When it's in standard configuration with both ladders combined, it provides a lot of support and I feel 'stable' standing on it. When they are separated, the steps are a little smaller but it still works. The picture shows scaffold mode, which makes it seem like it comes with the scaffold, but it doesn't. It's pretty easy to increase and decrease the height."
5,Werner Ladder REBATE offer at Lowes!,"Lowes/Werner Ladder REBATE offer!!! - After MUCH reading, shopping, looking, studying & comparing ladders I purchased the WERNER MT-22 ladder at Lowes. I think the Gorilla & LG & Werner ladders are comparable, BUT I liked the 2 rivets attaching the rungs instead of the plastic clips like the LG & Gorilla have. It's a little heavy yes, but SOLID as a rock! I love it... Now for the GOOD news! --- Lowes/Werner has a REBATE offer going on NOW until 7/10/2005. Buy a Werner ladder & get either a $25. or a $50. REBATE = Lowes Gift Card. I got the MT-22 ladder & a $10. Werner ladder accessory & got a $50.oo REBATE! (Lowes Gift Card) Total for the MT-22 ladder & accy. was only $158.oo plus tax! To good an offer to pass up! I went back in Lowes yesterday & they only had (1) MT-22 left! Get it while you can! :-)"
4,Good Ladder,It is a good ladder that can be used for many functions around the house. The quality is excellent. It is on the heavy and bulky side so it is not for a dainty person. It is something you take out for big jobs and not really a replacement for a good 6 ft. step ladder.
1,Werner ladders - easy to break,I've had a Werner attic ladder for 4 years... the ladder leg hinge broke. I've used the ladder a total of 12 times and I'm under the weight limit for the ladder. The company's response... buy a new $300 ladder and pay $200 for someone to install it. BAD COMPANY
4,ladder,Great for around the house with our vaulted ceilings and for getting to trees and top of house.
4,Strong But Not For The Weak,"An excellent multi purpose ladder, exceptionally strong. and fairly easy to maneuver into position; but the MT-26 is quite heavy and not for those that cannot handle 50 lbs. !! A well consrtucted ladder that should last for years and offer peace of mind 10' in the air !!"
1,liar!,Ladder is not 17 feet if u go to the werner website it says only exstends to 14ft 8 inches. Don't be fooled like i was!
1,Heavy and not easy to use.,I give it 2 stars because it's way heavier than a regular ladder which you just open and use. This one require more steps to set it up to use. This is 1 of the worst item that I have purchased and felt regret. Stay away from this because the step required to set it up to use can snap your finger if you are not careful.
5,Much bigger (and prettier) than I expected.,"I purchased this as a gift and thought that it would probably only fit well into a planter but I was wrong...the butterfly is as big as your hand and is a beautiful bronze color. While the glow in the dark effect is a little on the weak side, the beautiful blue/green swirling color of the ball more than makes up for it. I look forward to seeing this in my friend's garden for years to come."
2,Does not live up to product description,"While the butterfly stake is pretty, we are very disappointed that it does not live up to the product description which says that it glows in the dark, our main reason for making the purchase. We placed the stake in the sunniest part of our garden, which has sun all morning and day long, and it does not glow at all. We also purchased the dragonfly stake, and it unfortunately does not glow in the dark either."
2,Me!,"I received 2 stakes without the ornament. When I purchased the item I thought it would be much larger than what was received. I have seen these at other stores, was disappointed, intend to return."
4,authentic potrayel about the partition,"Must see for the people whose parents/ grandparents had to live through the horrors of partition in 1947.Although the movie is based on a fictional novel of the same name, the storyline is great and the acting is amazing !"
3,good,easy installation. excellent size. high quality material. needed a place big enough to carry. I would recommend. quality and price ratio is good.
2,Too expensive,"Bought this one instead of the off brand alternatives, and it was really no better. Hard plastic, doesn't fold back. Works fine but not worth the cost."
3,Expensive piece of plastic,Does what it is suppose to.......Price is a joke. Canon should include it with the lense. Jack up the price to cover the additional cost. At least customers would not feel they were being fleeced.
4,Good Product,"Well made original equipment product, fits perfectly. Only critisism is that it is way over priced, as are most OEM products. Several (but not all) of the aftermarket 3rd. party products are of equal quality - just be careful in what you chose to buy."
2,"It should come with the lens.. besides, it leaves a shadow on the corners","I does what it is supposed to do, but:1) Leaves a shadow on the corners at 17mm.. It's a shame that Canon makes this with this problem.. Is that a design problem?? I think so..2) You buy a lens that costs about US$ 600.00 and then you have to spend more US$ 30 on the hood.. what a shame. It should come with the lens.In spite of working well, because of the two issues above, not more than 2 stars for it."
3,Good Protection for Lens,Ideal for lens protection and unwanted creeping in of light. Though a tad bit over-priced.
4,Good lens hood with one limitation,"This lens hood does what it's supposed to do, but if you are using a 40D with the built in flash, it will cast a shadow on your subject at about 28mm and within roughly 7 feet."
2,Why to Buy?,"Functions fine, sometimes will leave a shadow. Irritated that Canon does not include with a camera but makes you buy a $30 piece of plastic."
2,Hoodie,Product discription misleading in that this lens hood would not fit lens as decribed. The generaly material of the lens appears well made and potentially would hold up to a variety of conditions however the locking mechanism needs to be significantly improved.
3,Decent Lens Hood,"How much can you say about a lens hood? I gave it 3 stars because it's a little clumsy to put on and off. Otherwise, it does the job."
3,"Maybe it works, but stores funny -- also, overpriced!","I've honestly yet to use this in a scenario where it may be needed, but I can say that the ""storage"" option where you flip it and store it on the lens sucks -- can barely work the zoom with it on like that!Given the high price (as far as chunks of extruded plastic go), it seems it may be better to just use your hand or had for the same effect -- after all, they both store quite conveniently!On the good side, this did not catch on fire or kill my baby. So... I guess it's got THAT going for it. Also, it did not explode when I touched it."
3,Good quality but over priced.,No complaints about product . But it is just a single piece of molded plastic that probably has a factory cost of around $1. Three instead of 5 star rating due to cost/value.
3,Too expensive!,"Canon's pricing on this lens shade reminds me of inkjet printers: they practically give you the printer, then skin you alive with ink costs. Don't get me wrong, the ""tulip"" shade works fine (although it throws a shadow on imges when you use the pop-up flash), but it should cost a fraction of what they charge. I'd guess they cost less than two bucks to make, if that. It's nothing but formed plastic. I don't like giving Canon a bad review because, otherwise, they make world-class products. So I'd give this lens shade five stars for use, but one star for pricing, an overall 3."
4,Should have been included with lens.,"This lens hood is (of course) just right for the lens, but it's a shame that Canon squeezes a little extra revenue by selling accessories that ought to be included with expensive products."
4,A great piece with one disadvantage.,"The construction of this item is great; it's Japanese made so you can tell that the quality built is outstanding. What I didn't care for too much was the fact that there is vignetting at the very wide angle (at 17mm end). I use it on a Canon 7D, maybe on full frame it won't be as bad, though theoretically it'd be worse. Other than that, it seems like it's an item that can potentially hold well for years.PS: the vignetting issue is the only reason I gave it a 4-star, because it's VERY minimal."
5,Works as described,"There are not much to say here. It fits as it is supposed to, and for the price, I am very satisfied."
5,Great Lens Hood,"My lens hood arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. It easily attaches to my Canon digital camera. After researching the importance of using a lens hood with a digital camera, I decided to purchase one soon afterwards. Amazon provided all the information that I needed in order to find the right one for my camera. It is well made and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
3,"Not Official Canon, No Felt Batting","This lens hood fits and appears to do it's job for the most part, but it is not made by Canon. In the picture it looks like a Canon model and does not have the word ""for"" before ""Canon"" but the item I received is definitely not made by Canon and does have ""for"" before ""Canon"" on it.If you're looking for an official Canon hood (one with felt batting on the inside) to eliminate stray light when taking shots this isn't the one that you'd want. If you don't mind it having a slightly reflective interior that won't stop as much stray light, then this may be the right hood for you as it's not very expensive.It works better than not having a hood at all, but not as good as the official Canon hood."
3,WAY too big for my Canon Rebel T3i,"Looks like a decent tool made of decently strong materials, but I'm new to DSLR and thought it would fit my Rebel T3i... however its WAY too big!"
5,As Advertized,Easily snaps in place and does the job. Considerably less expensive than the local retail outlet - and delivery was quick as well.
3,Didn't Fit my Canon,Seemed like a good quality part but unfortuantely did not fit my Camera a Canon T3I DSLR camera. Return and credit was super easy and only lower rating do to wrong size.
4,Canon Lens Hood EW73B,"Nice Quality, but overpriced. Does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens, and reducing glare in some situations."
5,Balance the Light,This hood is just what you need to keep unwanted stray light out of your shots. I goes on easy and comes off just as easy. The only thing I found bad was leaving on the lens makes it a little tough to get the lens cap off.
2,no room for captions,This was not what I expected. It just holds pictures - there is no room to add a caption. Very disappointed.
5,'DET Live! Vol. 2,"Come on ... who am I kidding, there's only one reason I have this really rare double disc set of exclusive acoustic and live performances that are totally unique to this disc, produced for radio station WDET FM 102.9 out of Detroit, and that's because there's a Luna track, ""Superfreaky Memories,"" on it. And of course, if there's a unique or rare track from Galaxie 500, Luna, or Dean & Britta floating around out there, then I've just gotta have it.BUT and there's always a BUT, the rest of this double disc is really good as well, featuring some of the best of the best, and a sweet collection of artists who were new to the scene back in 2000, and have since become legends in the years that've passed. The set makes for a great mix, and may just spark you to venture into the world of a few artists you may never have heard of.Review by Jenell Kesler"
2,Not much more than a temp indicator,"I'm a weather nut and love to track wind speeds, rainfall, temps, humidity, etc. It does a nice job with temp and humidity; but that's about all. The rain gauge was fussy from the start, but stopped working altogether within about 3 months. I didn't get a quick response from customer service, but when I did they wanted me to jump through some pretty big hoops before they would even talk to me about replacing the rain gauge. I decided it wasn't worth it and scrapped that. The wind meter isn't instant, it takes readings every minute or so, it's like getting a snapshot. The software works, but not all that well; there were certain things I couldn't get to work right. Overall I'm not happy with this unit and will someday replace it with a truly professional weather station. For now I get my temp and humidity which is actually pretty accurate."
2,Data base errors,"The 2315 weather station is not the best deal in town. If you are trying to keep a history of the weather. The data base is in a compressed format and if there is an error, you have to start a new history file losing all your data. I do not know of a data base that does not get errors in the data. All data bases have some way to repair or delete bad entries except this one. Contacted customer service and they said there is no ability to delete/repair the bad records. So after looking at all the other reviews on this product I can not recommend anyone purchase this unit."
2,A good product,"The system works very well and after a tornadic storm hit our area in Alabama, the wind sensor failed and they replaced it.Don Coats"
1,Poor customer service,I am happy with the weather station but very unsatisfied with the customer service. I have e-mailed them 3 time with a question and they have never replied.
4,A bargain for the price,"The unit is not dead accurate on wind speed, but it responds to a 5 mph breeze. I have been downloading the data to my computer. That is an excellant feature. It works well and it is cheap. I thought the instructions should say more about mounting the rain guage. The screws are inaccessable without dismantling the mechanism. Overall, a real buy!NOTE: Oct2006 it is still working perfectly on original alkaline batteries. Still very satisfied."
3,Should not be called Professional....,"I think its an alright unit for the money. Here are the cons; 1) Needs batteries at least once a month in the outdoor transmitter. 2)Does not detect wind in real time. 3)After replacing outdoor batteries, master unit needs to be re-setup entirely, no memory was so ever. 3)Indoor units buffer fills quickly resulting in no more readings to the included software.Pros; 1)cool software and it'll record a history, I found 1 reading per 1/2 was the most the buffer can handle. 2)Easy install. 3)high quality indoor unit, looks very nice.Professional, definately not. Adequate for the hobbist, absolutely!"
2,don't be fooled!,"this thing is a pretty good station if you just like to see what the temp. is outside, but it's not good if you have to use it every day like I do. The wind sensor doesn't work and the rain sensor is kinda iffy on accuracy. I wouldn't recomend it."
1,Not worth it,"I bought the weather station but I have a few problems as explained below:1. The outdoor temp sensor is inacurate, over reads by 5-7 Deg C.2. Indoor temp over reads by 3-4 deg C.3. The outdoor humidity sensor is highly inacurate, way out.4. I have yet to get another devise to check the acurracy of the wind speed.5. At times the outdoor sensor switches itself off for a duration of 30 - 40 min for some unknown reasons, I cannot find out why.6. The power supply conector don't have a good contact to the main unit.They should make this things more accurate and reliable then just the good looks."
2,Amateurish,A rather amateurish production. Irritating camera techniques and annoying background music / sound effects. Nothing much interesting about it. Have seen better. Wasn't worth the price.
1,rubbish--shouldn't even have 1 star but you can't give none,"This is more than amateurish--there are random ""profound"" statements that are both garbage and incorrect. The ""rare access to the Apple Building, Abbey Road studios and Strawberry Fields"" include roof scenes (with exceptionally bad shots of the non-central London skyline), the exterior of the building, and the gate to the site of the playground of the orphans--make sense? Well that gives you a good idea of this DVD. If you are an obsessed Beatles fan, go ahead and buy it, but don't have any high expectations (the rare photos are often pretty bad, as is the press conference--""obscure and long unheard,"" yes, but hardly ""insightful""--footage at which nothing is said, oh, and if you like Ringo, he appears for all of 3 minutes at the end), otherwise give it a wide wide berth."
2,No flavor,"I normally buy my spices online - they are freshly ground or send whole for me to grind. I inadvertently forgot to order 5 spice. I use the one without pepper in it so there are limited options available when you run out and need it now. So I ordered this. It has very little flavor - I suspect it has been sitting around for awhile on a shelf. It'll do in a pinch but I use this specific seasoning a lot so next time will be ordering enough at Whole Spices to keep me going awhile. Be aware that ground spices usually only hold the flavor for six months, unless you are keeping it in the frig or freezer."
3,Meren Hits,"It has some good tracks and some others that should not have qualified as a hit. All in all a good CD, but not fantastic."
4,Top of line Merengue compilation series,"This series never dissapoints. Many good tracks here including the popular ""Cuando El Amor se Dana"" by Rikarena, ""Pegame tu vicio"" by Eddy Herrera, and the incomparible Serio Vargas with one of his best ""Dile"". Buy it, listen, dance, and explore other music by your favorite artists on this CD."
2,Fun to watch for its total lack of talent in front of or behind the camera,"The Mole People is one of those old sci-fi/horror movies that are fun to watch because of their ineptitude. MST3K did a good job with this particular roll of film when they were on the air. A group of archaeologists accidentally discover a race of people living underground. These people can't stand the light and when they see the scientist's flashlight they believe them to be Gods because they carry light in their cylinder. Only the high priest believes them to be mortal and he spends the movie trying to prove it to his king. The humans try to find a way out of the Mole People kingdom and cause a rebellion among a group of creatures they have enslaved to do their labor. It's all done very badly and with no action or suspense whatsoever. The script is stretched tight to make a full movie out of a twenty minute plot. The Mole People is not a well made movie, but can be fun to watch nonetheless."
3,"Good resource, but far from perfect","This is the whole Kind of Blue album, transcribed.I've (painstakingly) transcribed all the horn solos on So What, and I can safely say there are a lot of mistakes in the book. The Davis solo is accurate, being slower, I suppose, but the others have wrong notes and missing notes. Maybe not a tremendous amount, perhaps 5% of the notes or less, but still, when you pay the money for someone else to transcribe it ...But it is a good starting point for your own transcriptions, if nothing else. And maybe 95% accuracy is close enough for you."
1,Hal Leonard is a BAD JOKE!,"Over the last few years I've wasted too much money on Hal Leonard publications only to find them incomplete and full of errors. The people doing the transcriptions seem to be lazy and careless but not nearly so much as the so-called ""editors"" who let this amateurish work go into print. Better to sit down with the recording and sharpen your own ears through careful listening."
4,Cute Book,"We are a homeschooling family and we bought this book to have on hand. We are also currently raising our own flock of egg laying chickens so it has been fun to read books about chickens themselves. It taught us a thing or two and most importantly, the kids enjoyed the book."
4,Slightly Neurotic,"This video is very bright and kids love it, but it is a little nerve racking and I think is better suited for older kids...Ralph's ""rotten"" antics are confusing to the under 4 or 5 set...but really it is cute and full of action, so I give it a 4. But some parental guidance wouldn't be a bad thing."
4,War Pork...,"In terms of clip size and all that other stuff, i don't know either. But for the power, generally the ones with 4 AAA batteries go 180 FPS. This one probably goes 200+, and 4 AA roughly equals a NiCad battery so i think ill get me one of these also."
2,Somewhat Interesting,I found this book to be somewhat repetitive and contrived. I would not recommend it for anything more than waiting-room material
4,A review of The Grumpy Morning,"The Grumpy Morning is a fun book to read to youngsters. Filled with ryhming sentences, the text seems to roll of off your tongue. Young children will enjoy hearing about the noise and ruckus the farm animals create when they realize they have not been fed. This misfortune creates the mood for The Grumpy Morning. After travelling through the farm with each animal, the author takes you into the farmers bedroom, who seems to have slept through her morning ritual of feeding her animals. As she is awoke by the noise of the grumpy animals, she emerges with a smile on her face and proceeds to feed and love her animals.The story is told from the point of view of a barn owl, who cannot go to sleep because of all of the noise that morning. The final page of the book shows the owl in his nestm finally ready to go to sleep, now that his friends are fed, happy, and most importantly quiet."
4,Fun story for preschoolers,"I teach preschoolers and they like this book very much. They enjoy making the ""grumpy"" animal sounds (for instance I ask them how a cow would moo in a grumpy way) - they really get into it, making funny faces. We talk about how people get grumpy, too, and they love to talk about when their family members get grumpy! The pictures are cute and colorful. I definitely recommend this book for reading to young children."
3,Cell Phone Holder,"The cup could not hold my Blackberry and I cannot put a pen in the cup as the shifter shaft will hit the pen. However I still have the cup in the holder because it is great for small items that I need close to my fingertips. Like a small flashlight, change, and small rocks my son picks up. Don't laugh it happens all the time."
5,Tom Wolfe meets James Patterson,"""Buzz Monkey"" is an extraordinarily well crafted novel.It brought to mind Wolfe's ""A Man In Full""; drugs substitute for real estate but the social commentary on our age of greed and excess is there in equal measure. For pace and excitement Buzz Monkey is as un-put-downable as Patterson's ""Kiss the Girls"" for plot, characters and even its head-on no nonsense take on racism. But above all this is simply a fun read, and the reader can certainly forgive Sam Hill for occasionally wearing his erudition on his sleeve."
5,A delight from start to finish,"Read this book, you won't put it down. Buzz Monkey captured all of the elements of great writing. It was fast-paced and thoughtful. The language was tight and sometimes edgy, sometimes just funny. Some of the lines I've been repeating to friends.. The characters were people I would want to meet (as long as Benny the Blade was already my friend). One of the things I liked most was the author's subtle discussion of race in the South, all-the-while treating me to a great ride. Okay, bring on the next Top Kiernan and Benny the Blade adventure."
4,Living Buddhism for the West,Intro on the long side but other wise a very compelling read for Westerners interested in Buddhism. A must read.
3,A glimpse back in time of the 1950s era South Pacific,"I happened upon this book by Willard Price, while browsing through a Friends of the Library Sale, and thought it might be interesting as a time capsule of life in the South Pacific from the 1950s. I was not disappointed.Certainly much has changed in the intervening years - but there is an enjoyable quality to the dry humor that enlivens Price's writing. The profiles of both locals and fellow travelers that he meets add additional layers to the travelogue narrative that add to the reader's pleasure."
1,One of the Worst Games I Have Ever Seen,"I bought the first Nicktoons Racing game in December last year. I figured that this one would be the same style, just with different characters. Only when I started the game, I found out I was very wrong. The music sounded very cheap, the graphics were also horrible, and the game is living proof that the budget was very small. There are only four places you can go to: Bikini Bottom, Retroville, Amity Park, and Dimmsdale. There are only eight characters, too, and until you win in a world with the character from there, there are four people you can race with. I only had to ""play"" the game for five minutes to decide if it was a piece of junk. I now regret ever thinking about getting this game in the first place. Of course, it's hard to write a bad review on something you've worked so hard on, but it's easy to when you haven't."
4,Ancestors found,"I purchased this book at the suggestion of a distant cousin. As it turns out it provides substantial insights into events directly impacting 4 of my ancestors. The political, cultural and religious events leading to their emmigration from Saxony to St. Louis are thoroughly documented in this book making it a must read for persons researching their family history if their ancestors were part of that particular emmigration. The events leading to their decision are explained in some detail which helps to personalize history. It is lengthy but it a good read."
5,Great for exploring family history!,"I bought this because I have several ancestors who are mentioned in this book. It has been very useful for me in my geneology work. It is also well-written and easy enough to read but I wouldn't call it a ""fun"" novel to sit down and enjoy. It's mainly history and well-worth the price for anyone who is researching their family history."
1,"Oh No, Mr. Borge !!","Even a die-hard Borge fan such as I, must wonder why Mr. Borge did this...very boring, very slow.There is none of the classic Borge wit, or sparkle, which can brighten even the most drab of stories.This DVD would be ideal for one purpose, and one purpose alone...the cure for insomnia...(with profound apologies, to the Master, Victor Borge)."
1,Victor Borge Tells Hans Christian Anderson Stories(VHS),"1ST ISSUES, HE DOESN'T SPEAK CLEAR ENGLISH, SO IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYNG. 2ND THE CARTOON PICTURE AND COLOR IS VERY POOR."
5,I love these!,"Not the best quality of knives but they are a great addition to any ""funk"" kitchen. I've had them for years and have received millions of compliments on their awesomeness :)"
5,Conversation Starter,"I bought this item for my mother as a Christmas gift. She saw it in a store in Italy on a trip with my grandmother, but the store was closed. I had found it on thinkgeek.com and used my universal wishlist to find it on amazon, since i did not know the name of it.The knife holder is amazing. My mom loves it. It will always get a reaction and start a conversation. Lionel, the family's go-to-guy for everything, is afraid of it. I guess he thinks it is some sort of voodoo talisman. Ha! Everyone comments on the knife holder when visiting my mom's kitchen. She is so proud of her new gift.I personally like the easy set-up and the knife sheaths. The knife sheaths are great because they protect the knives and no one will accidentally get hurt."
1,Returned,"I've wanted one of these for a long. When I finally purchased this one and pulled it out of the box I couldn't believe how damaged the red plastic was. From scratches all over, to cracks around the base. Sent it back the same day I got it."
4,Nice conversation piece,"I bought this set as a unique conversation piece. We had recently remodled a kitchen, and had a spot to fill on a bare counter. I had seen the product once in a specialty store. I will probably never actually use any of the knives, but they seem to be of pretty good quality. The holder itself is made of plastic, with a large base to keep it sturdy. It also seems to be made to last, even with daily use.For what I purchased the product for, I am very satisfied."
4,Great Outlet for a Psychopath,"Despite a slightly misleading title for this product, I'm a fan.I was expecting the holder to be something other than plastic, but it does have a weighted bottom and the knife slots are magnetic, meaning the knives are secured... coupled with the blades being partially covered while allowing the blades to air dry, it's a great design.As for the knives themselves, they are a decent steel, and come reasonably sharp. I've been using them regularly for a couple months now, and the edges have held. Not bad for $70.But that's not why you should buy this product. There's something deeply satisfying about stabbing a miniature man in the face with a paring knife. It goes in so smooth, and just feels... right....not that I encourage violence."
4,not to shabby,"The set looks amazing, but the plastic seems a bit cheap. I had thought the plastic would be solid, and a bit more heavy.Regardless, it was money well spent and I highly suggest it"
1,Violence,"Hey, where's the one with the knives sticking in a woman? I'm just curious because if there was one you know Amazon would not be carrying it and all sorts of groups would be screaming violence against women.This product is horrid."
5,"Great, but one small issue...",This knife set is awesome. I just wish it didn't feel so cheap. The abdomen knife will not go in all the way. It jams and trying to make it fit just scratched the thing all up.
3,Voodoo knife block,The purchased item arrived with damage to the back of the item and one knife did not fit into the assigned area. There was also a lengthy delivery time.
2,NOT GOOD!,"The product idea/design are good but the quiality is very poor. The knifes just OK and the plastic holder seems very fragile. In my opinion, it's not worth the money they are asking."
4,The holder is the thing,"This is a wonderful piece of modern design. Iconic and hilarious. The holder is made of hard plastic. I wish it were made of something like shiny vinyl on the outside, though. I think it'd be more protected against falls if it were. The knives, in my opinion, aren't as great as the other reviewers are saying. Mine have already started to get rust stains in some places so the ""stainless"" in stainless steel isn't quite up to snuff. They keep their edge as well as an average supermarket knife would. I haven't taken mine to a knife sharpener yet to see how well they'll take a refinishing.However, the point of this thing is the holder. And that is completely worth it. It always grabs attention in the kitchen. Even the construction guys working on our renovation laughed. If you're looking for a serious voodoo toy, this isn't it. The knives do not go in an out of the sheath holes so easily that you'd actually want to play with it."
1,Cheap junk,"I received this as a gift, and I never return gifts. But I returned this knife set. The knives were junk and the plastic holder was flimsy. I couldn't see it lasting more than a few weeks. Although entirely not functional, it was funny to look at, but that's not what I need in a knife set."
3,Lively and dull at the same time,"I love this product and it's a great conversation piece when people come over. It cracks me up when I look at it. However, the knives are quite dull and that's really disappointing. I'm willing to go buy similar, but sharper knives to use in that."
4,cool and useful!,"The only weird thing is the plastic bits that hold the knives in the back of the man, but otherwise it definitely gets a lot of attention. I think my friend who had this might have removed the plastic things, but I'm not sure.The knives are good quality, at least for a person who doesn't know the first thing about cooking... I followed someone's advice and I make sure to wash and dry them right after using, and they haven't shown any stains.It is pretty big, and lightweight like someone mentioned, but I have it up on a shelf next to the microwave, and it hasn't fallen of it's own accord. If it were accessible by cats I would probably be worried.Overall, I'm very happy with the item, I will probably buy a few for holiday presents."
5,The EX...5 Piece Knife Set with a twist!,I first saw this in a magazine at the Hair Salon I go to and it brought a smile to my face. Hilarious & I think people will get a kick out of this. This was gift to my daughter who loved it and said the knives are well made & the holder is a good size. Great conversation piece.
1,Canadians beware,"I would strongly advise Canadians not to purchase this item. Possession of one of these would be asking for a Human Rights Commission investigation. It may be funny and legal in the US, but not in Canada. Beware and play it safe."
4,Great Gift,"This item has not been opened by me as I bought it as a Christmas gift for my brother, so when he opens it I will know more about it. As far as the design and product idea goes it is great! I can't wait for him to see it."
2,DONT!,"I bought this Item years ago. Aesthetically, it was perfect, BUT it's too big for a small kitchen... the plastic was thin and the body was hollow. just not worth the money.This was the first item I have ever returned online."
2,Cool concept buuuuuuuuuttttt...,I guess I should have read the description closer. The holder is plastic and looks kind of cheap. The knives (that I didn't necessarily need) are nothing special. This would have been amazing had the holder been ceramic (or the likes) and you had the option to not order the knives.
