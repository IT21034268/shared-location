2,"Hey, I'm Generic","ZzZzZzZzZTired, boring, generic emo-pop with a hardcore twist. Yeah, it's been done to death, and it wasn't even that great the first time around.Most of these new ""myspace"" bands couldn't craft one memorable song if their life depended on it, and sullivan are no exception. While Tooth and Nail are busy cashing in on the christian emo craze, plenty of good, solid rock bands are going undiscovered, which pisses me off.Not Recommended"
2,what a disapointment......,"yeah, this band bummed me out.. when i listened to samples at the store, they reminded me of dashboard confessional + underoath which was cool... until i heard about 3 or 4 of their songs. they start to sound the same after a while, i got bored with the cd by the time i hit the last song (which is the title track and i didnt like it....) so if you would like an emo band that sounds like everyone else... sullivan is your best bet....."
4,Good but Not Good Enough,"Don't get me wrong, this is a quality product. I just wish there were more aquarium blu rays available with more and different fish. The aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans has a Fantastic large aquarium with Fantastic large fish that would make, in my opinion, a truly Fantastic Blu Ray disc. The fasination is not only in colorful fish in high def but imagine really big sand tigers, groupers, drums, hammerheads, ect., swimming by in high definition, for hours on end. I for one, would love it. I think many others would too."
2,A disappointment.,"I though this DVD was quite boring. Put in my player upon receipt, but found the aquaria were not very exciting. There are only 3 different scenes on the DVD, of which 2 are dark. Also the fish lacked colors and the whole thing was just much less than expected.What you see on the DVD cover is probably the best frame on the DVD.Waisted my money as I looked at it for 5 minutes and will never play it again."
1,Deceiving description on disc cover,Nothing special about the quality of video and sound. No extra features or audio tracks...Does not worth it!
5,Chill out in Hi-Def,"I bought this for a friend after my wife liked this company's Bollyrobics DVD. If you want something to show off your new HDTV and sound system during parties, you can't do better than this.It's a great buy as you can watch it over and over and it never gets boring -- you'll have hours of chilled-out fun watching the fish do their thing. Each has their own unique personality and they seem to play little games with each other. It's pretty amazing...Lots of fun and looks great -- either for a party of if you just want to chill out after a long day."
1,Not Worth the Money...any money,"Just a video camera placed on a tripod in front of the glass of a local aquarium. Only average video quality, poor composition and production. If you want something more than a screen saver get Visions of the Sea Explorations by HD Scape."
5,best thing to entertain your flat screen ...,"when we have guest over I put the aquarium on - it does not disturb, but at the same time entertains the otherwise big, black hole in the living room ... the flat screen. Incredible quality - I fully recommend this - you will never get tired of it."
2,Nothing Special!!!,Gets boring after about 2 minutes. Its nice if you want to pretend to have a fishtank!!
4,Eminence Basslite Speaker,The speaker sounds great and is very lightweight for the punch it packs. Pleased with my purchase so far (using for a 60W Behringer practice amp).
5,BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN YEARS!!!!,"This book truly touched me on a level that no book has ever been able to. I can COMPLETELY relate to SOOOO many of the poems. I am warmed by the authors ability to relate to so many different situations. And INSPIRED by her strength to get her stories out there and ""IN YOUR FACE."" This book helped me understand a new perspective on life situations as I'm sure it will help many others. Thank you for writing such a wonderful book!!!!"
5,Thank You,"On time delivery, well packaged, product in the shape advertised, an overall flawless purchase.Recommend Book to anyone trying to see what living really means"
5,These are the bomb,"I loved these shoes. I have such a small foot that sometimes I can't get the Doc Marten's I love and I am reduced to groveling in children's departments. Well, I found the oxfords of my dreams in a kids 3 which is equivalent to a womans 5 and it isn't as bulky and heavy as some Docs can be when made for adults. They look great with jeans and with slacks and they will probably outlive me and the entire planet - the way Docs make their shoes. I only wish they would make their mens style available to women and start all their sizing down to 5. Don't they know women buy more often than men do? All those great styles for men sit and gather dust when women like me with a size 5 shoes would be buying them off the shelf if they would make them available. Also Amazons UK store has lots better styles in Docs than in America and most of them will only ship within the UK. Bumm-ah."
2,If he didn't do it,"Schulman is good fiction writer and, in this book, an uneven logician. It's bad if he believes his thesis...perhaps even worse if he's playing devil's advocate at this length just as an exercise in contrarianism. A woman was murdered and many of the friends and family of the murder victim are still around."
3,If you have a wild imagination......,"The book was an okay read but you really had to stretch your imagination. I believe some of the facts Mr Shulman dug up are more than coincidence, but I just don't buy it. If you've read all the other books for thier point of view, this is probably worth a read."
2,More hype!,"Mr. Shuman's theory was interesting, but a bit hard to swallow. Without any solid facts to back it up its just more hype. What he took 300 pages to write he could have said in 10. Most of the book was about patting hiself on the back for being such a smart guy."
1,The worst book ever written on O.J. Simpson,"I reckon I have read nearly every book written on Simpson and in my humble opinion this is the worst ever.....based on no foundation whatsoever...its that bad...the author has one theory and he will not change that opinion....even Simpson totally ignores the author and his theory which shows how bad the book is!!!1 I feel so cross that I wasted money on such a totally biased book based on the totally, unfounded opinion of an author who pretends to be famous. He comes up with no evidence to support his stupid, totally unfounded statements to try and become a serious, investigative author...he fails totally....do NOT buy...a total waste of money and your time"
2,"Nice, but missing a bracket","I like this towel ring, but it was missing the bracket to install it. We bought it a few months before we'd be able to install it, and therefore couldn't return it since it was past the acceptable date for returns. Now my husband is trying to ""rig"" something to install this."
4,bow case,"I love this product but for the price, a pool cue stick case will get the job done at a fraction of the price if all you're doing is bringing in a bow or two for repair. Now of course if you have a $7500 cello bow like my brother and a soft case for traveling in the car, this is a no brainer... BTW I have several Bobelock cases for my violins, love them all!"
2,Ok product bad handling,"The price was right on this product but the handling was pretty poor. it arrived in an oversized box with NO packing material what so ever. The box had been banged pretty well but the stuff inside survived. When I first went to use it I found that the tip for the blower was missing. I called B&D; who were quite responsive (after I had to go get many numbers off the unit), they are sending the parts I need to make it work.All in all I'd say for the price it was a good deal but B&D; could save themselves some money by doing things right the first time."
1,Who do you think you're kidding,I just saw the price of this item listed as a GREAT SALE item by Amazon.This blower/vac sells everywhere for $59.00 or so brand new!!!So whats the big deal?Don't let Amazon think you're getting a great deal.
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this movie by mistake, I meant to get silent house. this movie makes no sense. it should have been called girl with a flashlight. and I didn't know it's in Spanish laungage so I watched it in fast forward, and it took about 15 min and I was still bored and mad that I got this movie. it's a good movie if your going to take a nap."
1,mad !,Thank you: I was not happy on the movie i don't like reading sub titles and it is in spanish i don't speek spanish but you did ship fast.
2,Terrible movie,Idk but i had the impression this was suppose to been a haunted movie not sum woman that is completely nuts it wasnt anything i expected but if u want to buy it and see for yourself than do it i wudnt advise it
1,Girl with the Messy House.,"i am now suppressed to fine this file currently in AMC Theaters. It was shot in one take, but may have been filmed by a first time camera man. The film editing was very choppy. The story was simple. Girl is in a house with the electric off, so no lights, except for all the portable camp lanterns she continually drops. The doors are locked and windows boarded up. Plus trash every place. Also her father is missing. Well there you have it, the whole film.Don't waist your money on this film, nor time."
3,magical and ominous -- disappointing,"As a family is travelling by car to visit relatives, a heavy snowstorm forces them to stop in a shabby motel on Christmas Eve. The older family members grimly accept the disappointment of the delay, the baby is happily oblivious, but the young boy worries about missing Santa Claus. Mother reassures him that ""Santa always finds a way,"" and in the middle of the night Santa comes for a magical visit! The illustrations of the snowy, starry night, wisps of frosty smoke, the friendly reindeer and Santa are indeed touched with magic. The hyper-realistic style of the other illustrations shows the grown-ups looking very gloomy and casts an ominous pall over the story that is never developed nor clarified. The story line is very thin. The heartwarming message that Christmas enchantment can be found even in shabby surroundings never really comes through."
4,On Christmas Eve -- picture book,This is a beautifully illustrated Christmas story. Perfect as a pre-Christmas gift to a younger brother or sister. Celebrates the magic of believing!!
4,"Palm IIIx User in Dallas, TX","I bought the Incase Palmtop Case(red)for my Palm IIIx the day I bought my PDA. I have been very pleased with the quality of the case. Good construction, heavy-duty zipper, 3 pockets to hold credit cards, driver's license, etc. The PDA is secured in the case with a piece of Velcro. I particularly liked the red color as I feel it will call attention to itself if left lying around. Good protection, though I wouldn't expect this case to be of much protection if the unit is dropped. I find this case fits comfortably in a windbreaker pocket. All things considered, I am very pleased with this product."
1,Ugh! Get the black case!,"I got this nifty palmtop and I was happy. Then i ordered this case. I got it and it was just about the worst thing I think I have ever put my eyes on. It is less appealing than Jabba the Hutt. I quickly went out and picked up the black case, which I recommend you get before you get this horrid thing."
3,Vintage Peabo.,"A good buy. This CD is a great addition to your collection, if you're a Peabo fan. This album contains a few previously unreleased tracks, that I thought were very good."
1,Don't waste your time nor money,"As this was given to me as a gift, I can't complain about the price, but however much it costs, it's too much for this piece of fluff. As a BallyK fan you're much better off just watching re-runs of the show than watching a handful of the actors gush what it was like to film this in the town of Avoca. It's hackneyed and without merit. The 'interviews' sound as though they were filmed in the food court of a mall. And the 'bonus' interviews at the end of the piece actually define the words deja vu as they're just regurgitations of what you just got through watching! Everyone involved in making this piece of effluvium should be ashamed of themselves!"
1,On The Ballykissangel Trail,"I would love to write a good review for this DVD, I was waiting for this one to complete my set of the series, but unfortunately I got my copy and it wouldn't play on my DVD player even though other DVD's had no problem. A second DVD was received and it too would not play.I have been very disappointed as I believe the Mfg. was to blame for flawed DVD's"
1,Dissappointing,"From the very first episode, I was totally entranced with this show. I never missed an episode and now have it on dvd. However, ""On the Ballykissangel Trail"" is very poorly made and omits quite a bit of information and scenery that would have made it great. Fortunately, I did not buy it separately; it's an extra on one of the Series 2 dvd's."
1,Rocker Displeasure,"I love the denim and red. The rocker is very well built and my 1 1/2 year old grandson loves sitting in it so he can hear the bang. However, I am very very disappointed that this is not a true rocker. It has a small small section in the middle that rocks and then it becomes straight and just bangs on the floor. I have hardwood floors and I have so many indentations on the floor where it bangs. I thought that my grandson would be able to rock in it just like he does my recliner and the rocker I had as a child and my children had. Nooooooooo such luck. I would not purchase this product again at any price Disappointed customer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Dangerous Chair,"At first we were pleased with this chair. It is cute and seemingly sturdy. However, the fabric started separating from the seam on the back of the chair revealing the metal bracing. Tonight, my husband sliced his finger really badly on this metal. I am so thankful that it wasn't my little one that was hurt. This chair is going in the dumpster immediately. Please be warned."
3,Second or third times the charm?,"Ordered the chair in the chocolate brown color. Received it, but the ottoman looked as if it had been sitting in the sun too long and was half faded to a rust color as well as part of the arm on the chair. Sent the pair back, upon receiving the second one had the similar issue but it was less obvious. About the size of a softball on the ottoman is the same rust color but decided to keep it anyway. Wish I had exchanged a third time but being as it's not as obvious as the first I didn't bother. I recommend the brown as it matched better with our decor, and the pink one that several of our friends have seems to show dirt quite obviously. As far as the 'chenille' fabric description goes, I'd say a cheap brown terrycloth is much closer to true. Chair sheds alot, but is manageable and I'm assuming after it gets enough wear and tear it will diminish. Would buy again, considering the above - as I found this chair on other sites for double the price."
1,not worth the $,Thank God I did not pay full price for this chair...It has little ability to rock and the surface is stained easily and frays easily...Not worth the money and I purchased it on sale.
4,It's as cute as the pictureI,"This is definitely the cutest little girls chair. It really is as cute as the picture. Besides it being a bit pricey, everything else is great. My daughter loves it and I guess that's all that matters. I'd recommend it."
2,Dissatisfied,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the Rocker and Ottoman. One of the feet on the Ottoman has a large crack running through it. It looks as if the manufacturer tried to paint over it, but it is very noticable. The back of the rocker has a rip in the material and it is coming apart at the seam. You can see the foam underneath. It is a very cute chair, but the quality just isn't there."
3,"Super Cute, But Not So Durable","This chair is super cute! My daughter loved it and played in/on it often. The chair is made of a solid wood frame, and particle board seat, covered in foam and soft chenile fabric in a soft pink color. The result is a sturdy feeling, solid chair, but soft to sit on and cozy. Keep in mind, however, that the seat under the fabric and foam is particle board so don't let your kids stand on it as I did or they may break right through...as our child did while standing on the seat."
1,Beware It is Tiny.,"Don't be fooled by the pic with the toddler girl in the chair (blue shirt yellow pants), she is not a normal sized child or the chair in the picture is much larger then the chair you receive, which by the way they also shipped to me in the wrong color. Sooo disappointed."
1,Dangerous,This chair is dangerous. There is a thin metal brace on the back intended to hold the chair together that comes separated from the ends on the bottom corners. It effectively turns in to a razor blade sticking out of the back of the chair after a while.
2,Beware! Milk stains this material and it does NOT come out!!,"My daughter spilled some drops of milk on the chair and it left these lovely white marks. I automatically thought, ok, it's just milk, it won't stain, yet nothing that I tried got the stain out. In other words, it's really not cleanable. Once it gets soiled you're out of luck. I ended up giving it away. Don't get me wrong, it's a very sturdy and well made chair & ottoman (although one of the red buttons on the front fell off), it's just made of an upholstery that you cannot clean. Not so great for kids, especially toddlers who have a bottle or sippy cup. It's small, I wouldn't recommend it for any child above the age of 3. It rocks a little bit, not too much, but just to give them movement. My daughter loved it."
2,Fun while it lasts,"My 3-year-old loved this chair when he got it for his birthday but so did his older brothers. The internals are constructed of plywood and a soft pine, so it just didn't hold up in a household with four boys.Overall, it looks very nice, but the construction and materials are shabby for the price."
5,BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!!!,"This book was interesting, entertaining, and very informative in the most hilarious manner! I laughed, I cried, I redid my bathroom! I recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a laugh or needs to repair a household. I love this author. I hope he writes many more books in the future!"
5,Works Great!,Used this to check the pressure for an 1994 Camry after engine overhaul. All I can say is that it works! Includes multiple fitments. This tool is pretty sturdy and worth the money if you need a Pressure check for your transmission. Hope this helps! Thanks!
4,work out,"I was really excited to use this DVD system. I have not followed the diet, but I do the workouts. They are hard, but effective as you can mix and match workouts to match the time you have available. Some of the beginner workouts were hard and there was a lot of bouncing (jjacks, etc) that I my nursing breasts could not handle. The bouncing workouts were hard on my chest as well as my weakened bladder muscles (sorry if that is tmi!) from labor/delivery."
2,Exactly what the title states,"Deadly Brew is one of a series of books by Seymour Lecker, which I hope is a pseudonym. Contained within is simply a list, probably pinched from an OSHA guide, of reactive liquid chemicals that may explode when mixed. Period. Persons wanting a how-to guide with step - by -step instructions for collecting, assembling and employing a binary chemical Improvised Explosive Device will be sorely, sorely disappointed. If this book is representative of Mr. Lecker's other work, you would be well - advised to think hard before shelling out any serious money for any copy in any condition."
4,Amor loco por el Mex!,"Been listening to SPM since around Hustle Town with Mary-Go-Round being my favorite song of 1998 up until 2000 when I first heard Wiggy. The video had a lot of info I never knew about the Coy family. I would actually suggest this to true fans. The video quality isn't good, audio sometimes sucks... It's definitely an independently made documentary made by the people they are documenting with probably a video camera from 1972. No disrespect, I love the independent feel of it."
2,Mattress Cover,"Wasn't so happy with this product, ended up putting a plastic cover over the mattress cover. Although it keeps themattress dry...I need to wash it after my child has a night time accident - defeating my purpose, as using a plasticcover, I can use Clorex wipes to disinfect the cover and avoid having to wash it each time there is an accident asI have to do with this cover."
3,"Comfort fit, but poor protection area for longer legs","Would be a fine knee guard for someone shorter in the legs.I'm 6ft, so the guard was an inch and a half short on top and bottom.They were in-expensive, so I just gave them to a friend. A good guard but beware of the sizing..."
4,The granddaughter loved it,A cute and cuddlier puppy what more can a little girl or boy want. Wears well and warning it will evoke a lot of giggles.
3,nice front - lame tail,"As a long-time fancier of Siberian huskies, I'm always looking for nice stuffies of the breed. This one has a nice head but the tail is really lame. It looks like a white lab tail with long hair on one side only. NOT a Siberian tail! Position this one so only the front/head shows (wink)."
2,#LE750R Factory-Reconditioned,"Factory-Reconditioned Black & Decker 2-1/4 HP Edge Hog Electric Lawn Edger #LE750R... This is my first refurbish product, I don't think I will buy online another Factory-Reconditioned again (may be in store which I can see it condition). Not sure how long it will last but it's look beat up and a front wheel not straight. It's might be worth under $25.00 on the one that I got. Better to buy it brand new."
2,Not so happy receipt of unit,"I received my purchase and when I opened the box the unit came with the shaft in two pieces to be bolted together. However the AC cord in the shaft was ripped in half by poor packaging. Rather than return it, I labored to get the cords out and spliced them back together. Amazon gave me a small credit for doing this, and the unit works wonderfully. Watch out for poor packaging and rough delivery."
5,It really works,"The first time you use it, if it's been awhile since you have edged, do not expect it to glide through with ease (it had been several years since I edged my lawn). You will have to spend sometime working with it and going over places several times. You will probably have to use a shovel as well to get the grass totally removed. Once you do get the edge made, the up keep is easy. I prefer this edger over the gas powered kind for my use, which is a small home without a large yard. It has plenty of power and is very easy to handle. I was a little weary about it being reconditioned. It did come with some scrapes and cosmetic blemishes, which it's going to get these anyhow, so it doesn't matter. These didn't bother the function at all. All-in-all, I am pleased with my purchase and how well it preforms."
5,Happy,Great price! Does everything as advertised and more. I especially liked the easy clean out. Go for reconditioned if possible---who cares about a few scraches.
4,Reconditioned? My wallet doesn't care.,"My Reconditioned edger came with a scuff on the top of the main housing and that's the only thing that told me it wasn't new. All the rest of the product was packaged as new. I'm not sure why anyone would buy new instead? I mean, after I used it the first time and it cut through that Tennessee red clay it was pretty dirty. My point is: it's a outdoor piece of equipment that does a dirty job - why would it be important to be new looking if it just works?The motor is very powerful. I think if I let it cut through my concrete driveway it probably could. It was fun seeing the sparks fly out as it chewed through some of the rocks mixed in with clay around my driveway.I'm impressed overall for the price."
3,Decent,"This is a decent product, especially for the price. The one problem is the nut that holds the blade keeps coming loose, so I constantly have to tighten it. Otherwise, it works fine and digs in pretty deep, since I have St. Augustine grass in Florida, which is thick.I would suggest if you are on a budget and don't mind the long cord you have to use. If you can afford it though, go with a gas model for bigger lawns."
2,Lots of duds!,"About 1/4 of the glowsticks did not glow, or would only glow in a couple splotches! I was using them properly... I made sure on the ones that weren't glowing completely that they were cracked all the way up the tube, and I shook them vigorously to make sure the fluid was moved around. Some of the other sticks glowed completely upon starting, but within 1 hour were only lit in splotches.None the less, they were fun, and cheap."
5,Vital research source,What a vital research source this has been. Everything from an interview with Antoine Izmery (assassinated by military attaches in 1993) to Top Secret FOIA reports. I recommend this to anyone researching the 1991-1994 junta period in Haiti and the first coup against Aristide.
2,Where's the music?,I loved the musical when it first came out. I looked forward to the film release. I can't say how disappointed I was in the result. Why do directors so often think they can make a better story than the author intended?
3,irma La Douce,I got the movie because i had watch it a while back and like it but when itry to watch it on my i pad it kee going back to the start half way through i am not happy
1,Sent European Copy,"They sent European copy of Ir,a La Douce. My US CD player will not display it, needless to say I am very disapointed"
1,Received for Christmas: Region 2 DVD,"So, my boyfriend knows that I have been looking to buy this movie for some time, so he purchased it for Christmas. I opened it today to see if it worked, and when I placed it in my DVD player, I received a 'Playback Error' message. Since I live in the United States (Region 1 concerning DVD players), this disc is not compatible with any of my players. It is made for compatibility in other countries. No where when purchasing was he told that this disc was not made for Region 1."
2,Irma la flop,"This is one of my least favorite Jack Lemmon movies. The plot was slow, the jokes weren't funny. I don't know, this just didn't do it for me. It didn't seem characteristic of Billy Wilder's usual witty style."
1,Very disappointed,"This is one of Shirley's least appealing movies. She looks great, like she always does, but the plot is very thin, the jokes are lame, and the movie is more than predictable. Lou Jacobi does a great job as the bartender, but he can't carry this thing, and Shirley hasn't enough of a part to make much of a difference. It falls to Jack Lemmon to redeem the effort, and although he starts off strong, he ultimately drops the ball. In addition, the DVD is ridiculously expensive. Save your money for something more worthwhile."
2,So dissapointed didn't worked in my machine.,It wasn't compatible with my dvd machine only for computer version. Be careful. The instructions when I bought it weren't very clear and I got confused. Must fix that.
4,Pointer Sisters CD contains some rare treasures,"The well-known songs on this CD are available in a number of places, but this compilation also contains a few that are otherwise available only on cassette or vinyl. Of special interest to me -- and the reason I purchased the CD -- was the Sisters' cover of ""Echoes of Love."" I fell in love with their version in the over 25 years ago and am glad to be able to play it again."
3,Not As Good As I Thought,This book wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be or as good as some of the reviews make it sound. I felt like this author tried to make a story of it but he didn't have enough factual evidence and background about what happened to truly make it interesting. I felt his writing style dragged on and he was repetitive. He rambled a lot at the end of the book and flipped around to the different players in the Confederacy without really getting anywhere. Just wasn't what I thought the book was going to be or should be.
5,A Keeper,I have over 250 books on the War Between the States in my personal library and I think this is the best read since Robertson's biography on Stonewall.
3,An Honorable Effort,"Mr. Davis has written an engaging account of the last days of the Confederate government. For the many readers whose knowledge of the civil war ends with Lee's surrender at Appomattox, this volume will prove especially interesting. Parts of the story (especially Breckinridge's travels thru Florida) would make a pretty good movie and give you a sense for what the country was like when Florida was almost the frontier.My only real complaint about Mr. Davis' latest book is the length. I often had the feeling reading it that Mr. Davis was intent on showing off just how much research he did for this project... so we get journal entry after journal entry of how dashing, distinguished, etc that Breckinridge was. The reality is that you probably could have left at least 100 pages out of this book and not diminished the story in the process. Despite that objection though, this book is still worth a read."
2,"No Benzali, No Murder One","I remember originally watching season one and thinking ""this is the most inspired television ever written."" It was also perfectly cast. Daniel Benzali in Season One is pure magic as Ted Hoffman, as is the ever-perfect Stanley Tucci. Season One is like a perfectly choreographed ballet. Season two just couldn't pull it off. At the time, many of us abandoned ship the minute Daniel Benzali was ""replaced."" Buy Season One and forget Season two. It is indeed, forgettable."
1,CRACK,"Knowing how delicate Palms are, I bought this for my new IIIxe. The leather belt clip types just don't offer ANY drop protection and I thought this thing would. Boy was I wrong! Dropped it less than 2 feet and discovered the corners aren't protected at all, now I'm looking at a $100 screen replacement. I'm throwing this thing away and buying rhinoskin."
1,Warrior (yawn) Yoga,"Ever flipped through the TV stations and found one of those local cable channels showing a yoga class? Yep, that's what this is very much like!"
3,Not Particularly Accessible,A book written late in Crowley's life (if memory serves) cryptic essays on several Magickal emotions. Some will be accessible to non-magicians. Some will not. (Some may not make sense to anybody.)
5,muy buenos arreglos..sobre los originales,"como digo en el titulo la musica de estos arreglos, mas modernizada en algunos casos...y no en otros esta muy bien."
3,Stupid velcro,"Although I find the case useful, the velcro provided gets in the way. In order to secure my Jornada in the case, I had to attach the velcro circles. Now it stays still in the case, but the velcro causes problems with the docking station. I've had to remove the velcro just to sync the Jornada."
1,Flimsy with sharp spiral binding edges,"The metal spine is not attached to the book. I guess that's so it can ""flip back"". But the edges are sharp, and it is broken looking due to clumsy design. The top split open practically the second I touched it, revealing the cardboard inside. Not well made. Would not buy again."
2,"Skip these, they break!","I give this product a single star for its idea, and another star for the idea working relatively well. That said, I have 4 of these notebooks (2x1.5"", 2x1"") and every single one is now destroyed and will not hold papers. I bought them exactly one year ago for my semester at school. Each one has at least one ring that is warped and will not close anymore. Skip these, they are definitely not worth the novelty."
1,Zero Voltage,I bought the batteries because I thought the price was right but they were totally dead! I good price for dead batteries is no deal.
2,"Darling, but doesn't work!","This fish is a cute as can be, but its little teeth don't cut the dental floss! You have to use scissors, or if you use two hands, take one to hold the floss in place and the other to saw the floss across the bottom tooth. Too bad because I love him!"
5,very Soulful,"this is just another reason why 70's soul was so Beautiful&Special. you could truly feel the love from the stage to the Audience. I want to say RIP to all he Greats who have since passed since this special aired. the music,feeling&overall Warmth was felt during this special."
5,Good Music,"This guy has taken country music by storm. He mixes country with a little southern rock and wow, what we have after that is unbelievable. The first single How 'Bout You is a very ggod lead off single and a good song. The second single Two Pink Lines is also very good. It mixes country and rock together. This song is about a boy and a girl who think they are going to have a baby while waiting on a pregnancy test so he thinks of how life would be with a baby. Comes out that she is not pregnant. This is country music at its best. Worth the money to get this CD."
5,Don't skip this chance,"Guys....this is a must have. I got hooked on one of his songs and came looking for more. There is not a bad somg on this album. Lots of fun Gary Allen like songs, with a hint or two of George Strait and Randy Travis mixed together.Anyhow....get all of the songs, don't get one and kick yourself when you love it and want more."
5,Really Good Even After Repeated Listening,"I am not a professed music expert, but this is one of the best CDs I have bought in years. I have listened to it many times with small breaks in between and it just doesn't get old. The Christian undertone from an ""every guy"" perspective is a refreshing change to the ""me, me, me"" attitude of many popular people. It's worth it for country fans. =-)"
5,Excellent!,Eric Church is consistently such a great artist. I already had his second & third albums and decided that I needed the first one as well. I like almost every single song on all three CDs!
3,Sinners like me is a good song but...,"I'm a big fan of country music; I buy a lot of country albums year in year out, and listen to more online. When I write reviews, I'm usually very generous in giving out ratings. With this album, the most generous I can get is to give a 3.5 rating. Eric Church's work is indeed honest, his voice sounds sincere, but his songs are nothing we haven't heard before; in other words, they're full of overused cliches. The problem I see with some country albums nowadays, especially from newcomers is there's one or 2 pretty strong tracks, they entitle the album after its strongest track, throw in 8 or 9 more songs to fill an EP then there you go: Another album from another one-hit-wonder.If you're a ""completist"" like me, go out and get this but for those out looking for a good introduction to country music, skip this, there are tons of other good choices."
3,Good,"Not bad, bigger fan of his latest 2 CDs. Has a couple songs on there that have been on the radio."
1,i have not recived yet this item,"dear sirs, i did not recived the cd of eric church title sinners like me,puchase was made las 8 dec it is almost 1 month and nothing have yet arrived.I want my cd please, as this it suppose to be a present for christmas.Thank u"
4,Strange courses from all over the world,"I enjoyed the book. I sort of read it one course at a time (about 5 minutes). The first part is a golf version of the 7 peaks or whatever the mountain climbers call it. These courses are featured. It is 8 courses and range from hottest to coldest to highest to lowest, hardest, etc. Some of them are a hoot.Then the book turns to take a look at courses that are unique for some particular feature. I would judge the photography to be a little less quality compared to some of the course books I have but the book held my interst. I got a used copy for something like $4.00 total. I consider it a good deal."
1,defective book,"I should be reimbursed for shipping because the book was warped, pages wavy and I returned it."
3,OK....if you really liked Outlaw Star,"In my opinion, this game was not that original. It was basically Outlaw star with a few new add ons, not recommended. Save your money"
3,NOT COOOLER as the second game and lacks excitement!!!!,"Pros:* COOOL and FAST new combo fights. The Grandia battle system is still the best!!!* BEAUTIFUL and realistic graphics.* To many CG cinematics and the animation is SUPERB!* Good voice acting.* The characters desing is like anime.* Good intro with cool female rock music.* You can fly an airplane to get to the stages instead of just jumping into the map like in the prequels.* Touching story and sequences.Cons:* The powers are NOT AWESOME AND COOL as in Grandia 2.* You don't get TO excited by the sequences and the story like in Grandia 1.* The characters don't follow you when you are walking (they get inside you).* The characters desing is NOT SOOO COOL as in Grandia 2.* The music is not that good.* It doesn't have to much fun like in Grandia 1.P.S: At least this game is MUCH better than that STUPID, HORRIBLE and DISSAPOINTIG game called Grandia X!!! If you want a better version of Grandia X then you should buy this game.Adios."
2,"Good Battle system, very bland game","Having picked up this title on, essentially, the understanding that it has the same, highly entertaining battle system as Grandia II, it's safe to say I wasn't disappointed on that count. It even embellishes and adds a couple of nice touches.Unfortunately, that's pretty much where the fun stops. Mediocre voice acting, bland characters, a small world and a story that's difficult to care about all combine to form a thoroughly lackluster title.But still a better buy than FFX."
2,meh,"Not up to par with what you would expect for a Square Enix game. Looks okay, kinda boring. Story is so-so. Looks okay. Soundtrack is unmemorable.Does what all video games are supposed to do - waste time. However, with this game I was aware that I was wasting time.The only way I would recommend this game is if you've played through all the games at home multiple times, there's nothing else available to purchase, and you have extra money you don't mind spending on the game."
2,Soars and Crashes,"I guess I grew up between playing the second installment and this, because whatever fun can be gained from the battle system is immediately marred by mediocre voice acting and an insultingly simple story riddled with what could be the most plot holes I have ever seen in a single game."
4,A good piece of RPG if you like Grandia 2,"The game plot seems rather straight on from the beginning after taking off in the plane but the story has it's quirks here and there but it's nothing breaking or anything. It should give the player anywhere from 40 to 45 hours spanning over both discs.The combat system is nearly identical to Grandia 2's but the addition of aerial attacks which can deal a great deal of damage to enemies and the attacks can be chained (one after another), which is rather helpful against strong enemies or bosses.Graphics are an upgrade from G2 just about everywhere, some of the cutscenes, both CG and in-game really show some emotion on the characters such as tears falling down their faces to emotionless laughter.Voice acting is very good among all the characters as well, just as good as Grandia 2 did.Grandia 3 in my opinion, is worth buying if you enjoyed Grandia 2."
4,Great Game/Idea But Mediocre Graphics,"This is probably one of the funnest RPGs I've played in awhile, it's much more interactive with battles and exploration (ie you can actual move on the battle screen and avoid enemies when in exploration mode). The only draw backs are the lack of stunning graphics that most of us have become used to with the Final Fantasy series.This game does have some high points though, the story line is fun and is based in a slightly modern world (they have airplanes for Pete's sake!)but it still plays into the fantasy of idea of swords, magic, and special moves.Over all, the two draw backs of this game are the lack of graphics, (they're decent, but it can get annoying when the character lines get blurry) and the over-dramtic voice acting. If you can get past these two things, you will have an extremly fun, if not interesting, experience."
5,Pure Joy,"This CD has become one of my very favorite. I wasn't sure how well I liked it at first because it was different from anything I had heard before.For one thing it is all in Hebrew except for a few lines.At first I thought that it sounded ethnic or folksy.Now I just love it. Most of the melodies are extremely joyful and evoke a strong desire to dance with them. The lyrics are either from the Bible or from Jewish writings that are based on the Bible.I found myself longing to hear this music more and more. For anyone who has a desire toward God, or Israel I would recommend trying this CD. Also Eitan Masuri is just great singing Chassidic music."
5,Great shock/wrong application,"I have purchased Monroe before through Amazon and they work great. I anticipated the same this time but when I went to install, the strut would not fit. After researching with a local Dealership, I discovered that my car, 2000 Mazda Protege, had a mid year change in this application. The part search service on Amazon does not know this(which is determined by the VIN.) SO BEWARE. I did return to Amazon for a complete and full refund, including the postage. I do appreciate that, though it was still a hassle and I have yet to repair car. But make sure of the application BEFORE ordering."
1,Made my hair dry and brittle,"I purchased this based on the reviews I read and was expecting a great replacement to Pantene. What I got was a product that dried my hair out making it feel like straw and smelled horrible. In spite of only using a quarter of the shampoo, I threw this out.In all honestly I could not and would not recommend this product."
4,Silver gray hair brightner,this shampoo works really well in removing yellow from gray hair as long as you leave it on for 5 minutes or so. I did find that it leaves your hair squeeky clean. However a hair conditioner should follow to prevent dryness
4,Fine shampoo,"Fine shampoo - seems to be taking the ""yellow"" out of my graying hair so that it shines nicely. I think I should have purchased the conditioner as well. Shampoo is with a nice smell."
5,Best Shampoo for gray hair,I had been looking for something for my gray hair for quite awhile after Pantene stopped making their Silver Expressions and stumbled upon this product and thought I'd give it a try. I am so pleased with it. It brightens the gray and makes it shine. It has a nice smell too. I love it!!
1,Did not work for me,"I've tried the shampoo twice now and I do not like it. It did make my hair a little shinier, but did not remove the brass from my dyed blonde hair. Also, it made my hair so tangled after I towel-dried it that when I tried to brush through it parts of my hair broke off. It also did not moisturize at all, but left my hair more coarse and dry than before. I tried it because it's cheaper than Shimmer Lights, but I guess you get what you pay for. I just purchased the Shimmer Lights shampoo in hopes of some better results."
5,Inexpensive and good,"jhirmack silver brightening shampoo is cheap and good. I think that makes it a great value. When Panteene decided to drop Silver Expressions, I gave this a try. Works great. Does away with the yellowing and gives me back my silver hair."
1,Formula changed,I've used this brand for many years. The new formula is watery and has changed my hair color to a yellowish shade. Another great product down the tubes.
3,"Ok, I guess.",Haven't used it yet but does not have a bad smell like the condition had. I will not purchase again.
5,Jhirmack Silver Brightening Shampoo,This product is great. Really neutralies the yellowing. Hair is very manageable and shows the different shades of silver/grey with lots of shine. I'm glad I switch products. I also get great compliments from total strangers on how healthy and beautiful my hair is for being it's natural color.
4,Good Value,"This product works as well as most of the other silver shampoos I've tried. It is definitely better than any of the John Frieda stuff. It doesn't have a dramatic result, but it works pretty well. I will probably buy it again for the value, but if I am willing to spend more I'll go to my Shikai purple shampoo."
4,Great nostalgia,"Loved seeing all these people in their younger days. It is nice to remember Kenny Rogers as a break-through artist and not the plastic persona he became. The only reason I did not rate this a 5 star is the video quality--but hey, it is what it was back then: we watched a lot of blurry TV."
5,Fond Memories revived,"We are so used to the yearly Doo-Wop, etc. Reunion shows that come out on PBS, that we sort of forget what these artistes were like when they were just out, and fresh, and their music touched our hearts, or moved our feet. That's why it's so nice to have a DVD like this. Many of these types of shows, like Rollin' Down The River, were Summer replacements. This was a Summer Replacement for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, even down to using the same theater. We are used to hearing only portions of these performances, and so what a thrill to be able to see the entire performance. What's missing are the comedy sketches, which often weren't that funny, and so are hardly missed. More!"
3,A Nice Collection of Classic Performances,"As it says on the cover, the selections are from the ""Rollin' On The River"" TV series, and while the selections are good, I disagree with the statement on the back cover that they are beautifully restored. I think it has the same sound and video quality of the TV show and needs more restoration."
5,rock never sounded so good,"this dvd takes one back to some of the best performances ever and mickey jones really knows rock. Jim croce, tina turner, al green are just a few who really put in dynamite performances. If you dont have this, get it"
2,Agreeing with other poor ratings,"We bought this to go with the matching bedding. It didn't take long for the wood to start to give out and the mesh bag has become torn. All this is just from holding laundry. It's cute, but not very functional."
2,very cheaply made,I agree with the person before me. I received this as a gift and registered for it because I loved the design and wanted it to match the rest of the nursery decor. The frame is very cheaply made. It's worse than plywood. It's unfinished and lightweight. I have serious doubts about whether it's going to hold any real laundry. Too bad they don't make a wicker basket hamper in this design.
1,"Great idea, cute fabric, but...","I purchased the Lambs & Ivy Hamper as a baby shower gift from the recipients on-line gift registry. Cute fabric and matching bedding to go with the hamper. Problem I ran into though, was that the box the hamper was shipped in was the same original box the hamper would be in if purchased from a store. The box was thin and not suited for shipping. The box had been damaged as if something had speared the box, leaving a hole in the fabric of the hamper. I called the company to report the damage and was told that the item was no longer available and I could keep it or return it for a full refund. I liked the product but was disappointed in the company selling the product.Lambs & Ivy Sports USA Hamper"
1,100% Absolute bad stinky Cheese,"I'm pretty picky with my ""so bad it's good"" type of flicks but if your not then this one is right up your alley. Wes Craven's ""Swamp Thing"" was a childhood favorite of mine but it definitely belongs back there somewhere in my childhood memories. Simply defines the cheesey B action/monster flicks of the 80's(a stupid groaning monster,a bogus storyline,a rambo head band,some bad acting,nonsensical explosions & a great baloob shot)truly one of Wes Craven's worst films to date. When you watch this flick you can't help but to be shocked that this is made by the same man that just a few years later gives us one of the greatest horror films of all time in ""A Nightmare On Elm St""."
1,A BUST,"Well, Adrienne Barbeau has a nice set of bazooms, but that's about the only thing worth looking at in this silly nonsense that might entertain a few ten year olds. I had thought that maybe with an actor the stature of Louis Jourdan, A.B., and directed by Wes Craven, that maybe it would have at least something to recommend it. Afraid not."
1,"I laughed, I cried, I threw it away, and I damned it to Hell","I saw this movie at a local video shop and laughed uncontrollably at the cover and storyline. I purchased Swamp Thing thinking it'd pack a rather hilarious punch. I cried once the movie was over because only then did I realize I wasted my 4 dollars. Thank God it was that price because I didn't hesitate to throw it in the trash. I thought about taking it to a church to have it drenched in Holy Water and ask the priest to damn that movie to Hell. The movie, unfortunately, wasn't worth the effort."
2,Two Versions of Swamp Thing,"[...]The new release, with the red titling is a true PG release and does not contain the nude scenes.A Quote From Another Web-site:""In the right frame of mind, Swamp Thing is very enjoyable. It's currently causing a stir stateside as Blockbuster have had to recall every copy of the DVD because despite the PG rating, the film contains two sequences of nudity that had previously been excised from the film. These sequences are not necessary, but it is arguably better to have them rather than not. Nudity and PG ratings are not a happy marriage in the states, and so the DVD has been recalled until MGM decides what to do about it. Therefore, the DVD is a hot item, perhaps undeservedly so.""[...]"
4,Adrienne show off her Barbeau's,"This film is based on a well know comic book character.Lab accidents do happen. Doctor Alec Holland (Ray Wise) can attest to this. Of course this is the standard don't mess around with nature movie that is overlapped with a greedy bad guy Dr. Anton Arcane (Louis Jourdan). I think Louis gets a kick out of playing bad guys; he gets so enthusiastic. Alec gets all swampy and still gets the girl, Alice Cable (Adrienne Barbeau). He better hope she is not a vegetarian.Bottom line is when you reach into the medicine cabinet be sure you know what you are taking and do not get the plant food.Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"
4,Cheese,I bought this movie for a friend who is into cheesey eighties movies and he loved it. The crazy creatures in this movie are hokey enough to laugh at but at the same time believable enough to not totally nullify the action. If you like cultish movies from the eighties you can't go wrong with this classic.
4,Classic,"I have watched it a dozen times through the years and still enjoy it every time. Definitely worth a watch for some good cheap B movie entertainment,"
3,Rare Edition With AB's Bare Boobies,"Legendary director Wes Craven brings you this rare and bare edition. Was pulled from store shelves after mom complained to her local Blockbuster. Many fake copies exist so make sure bar code is correct, Region 1, and has PG rating (view cover art for this version). A new edition coming out August 23, 05. This edition lacks the 2 minutes of nudity."
3,Still Holds Up! perhaps like old tape....but it's holding nonetheless!,"I hated this movie as a kid. Even then I could smell cheese. But the older I've gotten, the more of a Swamp Thing fan I've become. I found this one on DVD the other day, and as a laugh, bought it.I'm impressed.Just try it. It's not as bad as you remember. So by that rationale...are movies getting worse?"
3,Much beauty in the swamps,"Cable is working in the swamps, and she doesn't like it ,but she learns to."
2,Don't Confuse This Edition With The Pulled One,"The prior edition that was pulled from shelves has the topless scene of AB. So if your a fan of hers you may want to pony up for the banned copy. If you think this will drive your copies value down in price (if you own the original copy) think again. For whatever reason when a new edition comes out that deletes prior edition's content the value for the original edition goes up.That said, this is a typical B movie from the 80's. If your not into rare copies and don't care about the deleted scene, this is your chance to get a copy cheap."
3,Which copy should you buy?,"Just to get it out of the way, Swamp Thing is okay. However, it did spawn the much better sequel Return Of The Swamp Thing in all its campy goodness.But, there are 2 distinct versions out there. If you want the US version, then buy the RED title cover. It is also 91 minutes. If you're looking for the added nudity version, then buy the GREEN title cover. The run time for the green version is 93 minutes. Then again, it makes more sense that the less butchered version is 2 minutes longer.Plain English: RED = Less nekkid, GREEN = more nekkid. Get it?"
2,Comic Book,"Adapted from the DC comic of the same name and directed by Wes Craven, you get to see cleavage throughout. It takes place in the Florida Everglades. Don't waste your time on this unless you're a diehard comic movie/book fan."
2,slow moving thru the mud,"Ali Davis' Amazon review well sums up this movie except that it wasn't all that fun in my opinion. Campy, yes, funny, no. B-rated gimmicks and special affects are apropos to these kinds of films, but for a Wes Craven flick??? Maybe it's not meant to be sophisticated, but it's pretty lacking in the clever department as well. I did enjoy seeing some of these actors of a quarter century ago in their younger years of work. But I can think of other B-movies that go with a bowl of popcorn on a Friday night much better."
4,A unique Mix of Horror and Superhero movies,"Dr Alec Holland (Ray Wise) and Goverment Agent Alice Cable (Adrienne Barbeau) Are Working on a Formula that could end world hunger ! But Evil Scientist, Anton Arcane(Louis Jourdan) Tries to steal it and mutates Holland into a half man-half plant superhero Swamp Thing (Dick Durock).I found it was pretty good but the Arcane Mutant look kin'da fake but had a great script and some pretty good actor's.A Decent Comic Book Movie."
4,"He could have done better, but it was real good.","I thought that Scream, Jennifer, Scream, was an excellent book. I thought R.l. Stine could have improved on the suspence, instead of dragging along. I really liked the ending, but I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it yet. I gave it 4 stars!"
1,Can You Say Dumb?,"I was really disappointed in R.L. Stine this time. I usually LOVE his books, but this time I hated it. I thought the ending was the worst part. And th plot couldn't get any dumber. I think this book was a total waste of my money, but if you like really, really, really, etc. stupid books you will definitley like this book."
4,It was good but too predictable,When I was finish with this book I found that it wasn't R.L.'s best. A mystery is suppose to keep you guessing until the end. But the reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 3 is because the end threw me off a little because I wasn't expecting that to happen. Overall it's good.
1,A Travesty,"Anyone who knows and respects Dickens as a wonderful author should avoid this work. I cannot speak for Alleyn's other works, but ""A Far Better Rest"" is nothing but a cheap parody of ""A Tale of Two Cities."" This book was painful for me to read as Sydney Carton is, in my opinion, one of the best characters ever created, and this book butchers him. Every other page I found myself wondering if Alleyn had ever even read Dickens for anything more than a vague timeline of the book's events. If you love ""A Tale of Two Cities"" don't bother with this one, it's not worth it."
5,"In A Word..""Outstanding!""","Absolutely wonderful reading. Susanne Alleyn's style brings you accurately into the world of the French revolution even deeper than Dickens' Two Cities.. The story is fresh and alive.Her story is one into which you can sink you teeth. Its beefy and deep. Even for those who are not necessarily into historic novels or romance A Far Better Rest offers excellent reading. Outstanding work by a first time novelists!ONE WARNING: Be sure you are comfortable, with your favorite beverage and munchies near by. Once you pick it up and start reading you won't want to put it down!Five stars or two thumbs up on thumbs-up on this one. You'll love it!"
2,really?,"I got ""The Goddess Rules"" on an audiobook and just loved it. . . it was funny and romantic. Unfortunately, this book isn't nearly as good. I had no sympathy or empathy for the main character and there were no real plot twists except for the protagonist's deficient character."
3,"It is, but it isn't","I'm one of those mid-twenty somethings who is really into the Bridget Jones style of books. This was not up to par with Bridget Jones. Usually a voracious reader, I kept picking up this book and setting it down again to read something else. Amy's childish antics grated on my nerves after awhile, and the whole thing was uncommonly predictible it fell completely short of my expectations."
3,Get it at the library.,"I'm kind of sorry I bought this book. It entertained me for a couple of days and was a quick, fluffy read, but I have no need to actually own it. The characters were mostly one-dimensional, which was annoying enough, but the author used a narrative device that was clearly intended to be clever but just succeeded in being irritating. She had this very cloying way of breaking off and speaking directly to the reader, as though she and the reader are just really smart girlfriends discussing Amy and Orlando's behavior -- at one or two points I wanted to throw the book through the wall. But, much as I hate to admit it, I found Love: A User's Guide to be amusing and engaging, despite it all."
2,Definitely not Bridget but an okay interim read,"I was looking for something to get me out of my post-Bridget slump and this wasn't really it. The main character is someone you WON'T feel sympathy for at all (in fact, you'll wonder why the ""hero,"" Orlando Rock, has feelings for her at all!), kind of like Ally McBeal, you'll want to slap her around a bit. And then there is this strange, totally non-consistent, omniscient narrator thing that pops in at the weirdest moments. It just doesn't work. But if you're post Bridget and looking for something to keep you busy in the meantime, this is okay."
1,save your money,"I should be sorry to say this, but I'm not: this is a HORRIBLE book. The style of writing was extremely hard to understand, and I had an easier time reading one of my economics textbooks than trying to read this. Not many books can give you a headache after trying to decipher a single page...and not succeeding. I even tried flipping through to see if the story got better, but it didn't at all. Aside from the writing style, the main character wasn't someone you *wanted* to read about. She just wasn't likable at all. I couldn't even finish one chapter before wanting to hurl it into the nearest trashcan, and that's saying a lot, considering I read pretty much everything. You're better off reading *Milkrun* or *Burning the Map* anything but this book."
5,"finally, a fun and romantic book !","This was a wonderful book, I would recomend it to anyone looking for a sweet book that just brings you up. Once you get into this book, which doesn't take long, you absolutely can't put it down! You will get so caught up in the sweet and exciting romance of Orlando and Amy, you'll wish it was happening to you. It isn't one of those dissappointing books that gets you all happy and then drops you off a cliff, it is sweet and ends just the way you want it to. This book sweetens up life and reminds you of the good times you know you've had. This book was great! A quick read too!"
3,Good if you like romance novels,"I am not a fan of love stories and romance novels, which this turned out to be. Call me cynical, but I much prefer reading about women who are WORSE off than I am. A happy ending is fine after a book full of anguish, but a book about some woman leading a fantasy life, falling in love with a wonderful man who actually loves her back: BOR - RING. But, to give credit where it is do, if you do like fantasy romance novels, then you might enjoy this book. It definitely had some very funny moments and was fairly well written (as well written as these types of novels tend to be)."
4,Fluffy and fun romance for the Cosmo girl in you,"This novel is like ""Notting Hill"" with genders reversed -- and with a leading lady who is actually appealing (unlike Julia Roberts). The author's asides, like a hipper-than-thou Greek chorus, were cute, and amusing and valid observations about life are sprinkled throughout. The cleverness and archness can almost be too much at times, so it's best not to read in one sitting. A dash of Joan Collins, a large helping of Bridget Jones, a sprinkle of Katie Fforde, mixed together with the Cosmo ""I can have it all"" sensibility."
2,A Guide for who?,"This was NOT the book I had hoped it would be. What an egotistical and self-indulgent person Amy turned out to be. She was dippy and conceited, and I had no sympathy for her whatsoever. And what was that weird narrator thing going on throughout the whole book? I felt like I was watching The Wonder Years, albeit a very, very BAD rendition. The one positive thing I will say about this book? Uh....hmmmmm....well, can't think of anything.... Okay, to be fair, despite the fact that the characters were less than appealing, the book was a total fantasy, so unlike real life, and that would quite possibly be some other reader's cup o' tea. Just not mine."
2,Secondary Characters more interesting,"The problem with many chicklit heroines is that in the need to make these characters light and entertaining, authors have made them a little too one-dimensional. The girls often come out as pre-pubescent girls who never grow up. The hero deserved better and so did the reader. The most interesting characters were the secondary characters,especially Lucinda. She is the only reason this book rated two stars Lastly the writing style was--for lack of a better term--weird. Reading it was a chore. I felt like a middle school teacher grading a less than mediocre paper. Save your money and don't even borrow it."
5,I couldn't put this book down !!!!!,"I had read a review of this book in one of the women's magazines and decided to order it. I was having a particularly bad day when the book arrived, but that quickly changed. It is light reading and highly entertaining (I was laughing out loud the whole time!) -- I couldn't put it down until I was finished. I can't wait for the next book by this author!"
2,Pass this one up...,"There is much better stuff to read - heck even better chick lit out there! This was not even mildly amusing and the protagonist is downright annoying. With the volume of books in this genre, it won't be difficult to find something more interesting."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"If the description on the back of the book would have matched what was inside of the book, I might have liked it. The back of the book describes a breasy light hearted romantic comdey. Unfortunately the book is nothing like the back description, and because of it I did not like this book. I wanted to read this book because it looked funny and at the moment I'm addicted to Brigdet Jones type books. Well, this book is not funny or comprehensive. I had no idea what was going on most of the time and I found Amy, the main character, not likable at all. So like I said save your time and money and get a better book."
5,"Not as good as Ms. Jones, but equally entertaining.","So she isn't ""Bridget Jones."" But who is? This book is a wonderful read for any woman who has at one time or another said to herself, ""If I was in the right place at the right time, I could snag Nicholas Cage."" It is for any woman who loves to fantasize about having a beautiful, strong, wonderful man (who just happens to be a famous actor) sweep them off of her feet and tell her that he loves her for her. I would recommend this book to anyone who liked the ""Bridget Jones"" books. The heroine is quirky and fun, yet insecure at times, which I am sure is a lot like any other woman. I was able to relate to her thoughts and though I am not dating a handsome actor type, I'd like to believe that I could if I wanted to."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....,"I don't want anyone else to make the mistake I did and purchase this book. It sounded funny and quirky, but this was one of the VERY few books that I gave up on reading. I made it to the fourth chapter and couldn't take anymore. The biggest problem with the book was that it sped from one idea/thought/etc. to another without any transitions or indication of a changed subject. It was like reading a stream of consciousness book without the finely crafted hallmarks of that style. Save your bucks...buy Jemima J. instead!"
4,Entertaining Quick Read,"This book was a great little ""quickie"" while I was between other novels. Do not expect it to be Sex and the City and you Bridget Jones fans will probably be let down. But it was far more realistic than I would like to admit. Ahhh...the naive mistakes people make when fame knocks on the door. Trust me...it can happen! (unfortunately) Don't look at the book to be bigger than it is, and you'll enjoy it as I did."
1,don't bother,"I liked ""Bridget Jones,"" loved ""Watermelon,"" but found this book to be utterly insipid."
1,I'm So Sorry,"I bought this book hoping it would be light and entertaining. Getting through it was extremely difficult, if not impossible. The narration of the story was childlike and the characters were as attractive as unwanted chin hairs. Three fourths of the way in, I had to put the book away. I checked out the end in a final attempt to see if the book had any redeemable qualities but it was so predictable I was disappointed. Perhaps if the story had some better twists and the narration style revamped, the book would have been a bigger hit. Borrow this book from a library before buying it. I felt so tired getting through it."
3,Light and quite funny,"A little hard to believe really. Try's to capture the Helen Feilding thing but a bit too fairy tale for my liking.I liked her flat monters, truely horrible and I wish they would have shown up more, as other than that it was a bit bland character wize. Predictable, from about the second page, of course her sordid sessions with the photographer would catch up with her. Sad her lesbian liason didnt create a stir also, in fact I don't know why she put that bit in at all, it was as though she was going to bring it in at some point, but forgot about it.Her writing style was good in parts, the star crossed lovers tale, using a Shakesperian tone,was cute, and a highlight. But apart from that, this is Mills and Boon stuff and nothing to get too excited about."
4,book review,"Book was in ""ok"" condition. Not like new like it said, but neither was it in bad condition. I was not dissapointed however, the book was sent immidiatly."
5,Diva of Divas,"Acting was superb in the Aida Act III. Not overdone nor exagerated. Ms. Price and others acted according to the words sung and I thought was amazing. An actress and a great singer all rolled into one. What a combination!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm piggybacking another rater because I agree. It was great to see and hear her magnificent voice near the beginning, the middle and near the end. If only more videos were made of her earlier performances; for example, Aida with Grace Bumbry (I have the vinyl). Is there a video?Yes the Cossi Fan Tutti was a little rough but one can still tell the voice was there. No one is in their best voice always on any song (no matter the age).The reception she received was magnificent and I wished I could have been part of the French audience.I wish her well!!!!!!!"
3,"To Bibb, or Not to Bibb!","Please be advised, check your water faucet type and size before purchasing. It will work best if you have a Vaccum breaker installed on the faucet bib. If your faucet collar is small in size then this product might not be useful and can be unscrewed off the faucet with the lock in place."
1,Do not purchase,Who designs an outdoor lock that rusts!?! Locks rusted big time after 2 weeks so badly and I had to force the key into the lock and apply a lot of turning force to open. Not worth buying.DO NOT BUY
1,Faucet seal not universal,I couldnt get this cover to fit and lock around my faucet. Its metal so it doesnt have much give. We.nt to lowes and bought a better lproduct for cheaper with easier returns
2,Not that great,I had a chance to look at 2 bars the Silver Zinc 1500 pound bar and the 1000 pound Black Oxide I wasn't very impressed First of all they are not 28.5 Millimeters but they are 30 millimeters ... The finish on the bars was ok ... but they don't spin very well.... The power rings look like suicide grooves ....I would recommend the Cap OB-86B ... This is a much better bar for the money
3,"Decent Quality, but Better Options for the Price.","This bar is a decent value for the price- especially when you consider the warranty. Champion barbell claims that all of their Olympic bars are 28.5mm in diameter but that is not the case. These bars are 30-32mm in diameter,and are great for the slower lift but not ideal for those looking to practice Olympic weightlifting movements. The machining is not precise on the sleeves and they rattle quite a bit more than my other bars. For this price, you are much better off purchasing the CAP OB-86B."
2,Not as good as Orville Redenbacher's,"I ordered a case of these since it seems the Orville Redenbacher's popcorn cakes are discontinued or at least in declining production. These cakes have the same look, texture and taste almost the same as a regular rice (not popcorn)cake. Products like this are dime a dozen and had I known they were almost the same thing as everyone else's rice cakes, I would not have ordered this. What to do when your favorite product cannot be found and seems to not be duplicated by anyone else? Such a simple, delicious idea, don't know why other companies don't make them."
2,"Cute, but Uncomfortable","These shoes are really cute but they are so uncomfortable. The material is really hard, so there is no give and they squish your little. I wish I would have chosen something else."
1,Horrid Kindle Formatting,"I cannot read this book until it has been formatted so that there is not a 20 space indentation in every paragraph and line breaks all over. The formatting is so bad that it almost looks centered.It was far too distracting to be legible.A shame, since it got a couple of good reviews from the paperback version.I will put up with a lot in a freebie, you won't see me complaining about formatting in many other reviews. I couldn't get past the second page of this one.I'll give it another shot if I get a corrected copy."
4,A Good Starting Point,"One of the 8 ways of raising power in a circle is with the use of ""herbs, incense, drugs, and alcohol"". Very few practitioners explore this possibility as it has it's dangers. Even fewer books actually talk about their use. This is a good starting point for folks who wish to explore that method of raising power, and to do it SAFELY. A must have for any good worting witch."
2,Assorted Colors ?,"My order arrived with 5 black and 1 blue. I guess that is technically an assortment, but it is disappointing when you want to use the croakies to help distinguish different pairs of glasses that look similar."
5,"Superlative ""close reading"" of a Brobdingnagian symphony.","This truly is a work deserving of all the above accolades. I can only hope that more of Mahler's symphonies will receive the loving and careful attention that this one has. The commentators are excellent: touching upon the oscillating post-big-bang universe represented early on in the work, to Mahler's influences from children's poetry to Schopenhauer and the Nietzschean rejection of the aforesaid's pessimism, to his personal life, and more. It is a compliment both to the viewers intelligence and heart and to the subject's genius. Thank you to all involved in creating this masterful work."
3,Its Script Bests Its Visuals,"The script of this piece is good, making this a potentially wonderful radio program. It explains the original thematic program of Mahler's 3rd and its historical, philosophical background more than it explains the symphony in musical terms. Nor does the documentary make much reference to other Mahler works or to other composers--but this history is solidly educational.The visual production of the piece is less sophisticated; many garish, contemporary pictures of landscape or sky chosen to accompany the music resemble screen-saver art, and transitions between these images are often abrupt. When time lapsed images of mountain streams (making them appear to flow with cotton candy) illustrate Mahler's ""nature,"" the disjunction between the sublime music and theculture of the motel can jostle even a viewer playfully attuned to Mahler's syntheses of high and low."
1,Be warned!,"I bought this on the basis of the various glowing reviews it received here. This is terrible. The documentary is glib, over-sentimentalised and downright embarrassing a lot of the time. The photography is bad too. The performance, far from being as fine as some would have you believe, is certainly a student one: playing is very, very ordinary and the conducting dull and lifeless. My old Supraphon recording with Neumann is a billion times better than this in every way."
5,What beautiful gardens and how wonderfully explained,"As a jewelry maker I very much appreciate beautiful design and the gardens in this book are so beautifully designed. But what I really admire is how wonderfully the often complex principles of design behind the creation of each of these gardens is expressed. The author, Keith Davitt doesn't just show us beautiful gardens with lovely structural elements and truly inspired planting arrangements, he explains in clear language a pleasure to read, how and why each of the elements in the designs work. Not only is he a master at designing and building gardens, he is a wonderful writer and I would venture to say, a deep and clear thinker as well. This book is a gift to garden designers everywhere."
2,Useless,"I was looking for a book to provide some inspiration. This just doesn't cut it. All the ideas are basically the same theme of too much vegetation and old world stone work.If you have a truly small space, you'll want to use it efficiently. This book guides you to crowd it with stuff rather than open it up smartly.Get John Brooks book instead."
5,Excellent Book for the Urban Small Garden,"I've searched in bookstores for appropriate books for a very small garden, to no avail. This book gives outstanding ideas for making a small space seem larger as well as more inviting. Of particular interest are the summaries (based upon the material reviewing each garden) as well as the ""before"" pictures that accompany the article (giving hope to those with bleak bare spaces). Also, there are drawings that show the overall concept for each garden, which provides a context for the individual photographs.Highly recommended."
5,Tutu's Reconciliation Theology,"The author, a prominent Episcopalian African-American theologian,was in residence with and understudied Desmond Tutu during the years that ended apartheid in South Africa and brought in Nelson Mandela as President. He was, therefore, in a unique position to learn the underlying philosophy and theology that led to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, a major reason for the peaceful transition to full democracy and the avoidance of the blood bath that many had expected."
4,"Me, and not the book.","Book arrived quickly. It was well packaged and in pristine condition. The contents of the book are as described, however, a bit too dry for my reading style. I love listening to Bishop Tutu speak, but not so much reading him. Best read in a book group with discussions to go with the reading."
2,Other Critter Books Are Better,"I am a fan of the Little Critter Series for my two year old. However, I'm not a fan of this particular book. Little Critter just says ""I'm sorry"" after everything he does wrong and it isn't until the very last page in the book that the reader learns the lesson: ""Saying your sorry just isn't good enough. You have to be more careful."" To me, this lesson comes much too late.Instead of this buying this book, take a look at some of my Little Critter favorites: Good For Me and You, All By Myself, The New Baby, Just Me and My Dad, Just a Snowman, Just a New Neighbor and Me Too."
5,If It Meets Your Needs It Is An Excellent Bag,"I bought the smaller version a couple of years ago and was very satisfied with it - perfect for carry on luggage, but I needed a bigger version for weekend train trips to carry a change of clothes, etc. Good, strong construction, loads of pockets, good protection for the camera, and it looks like I can hang a Camelbak reservoir in a slot at the back. Looking forward to giving that a try. Quality looks good (unlike my Camelbak where the top handle on it came adrift after 2 months!)"
1,New and improved -- with chemicals!,"Has anyone in the history of man ever looked at a Q-Tip and wondered, ""Are these fresh? What's the expiration date on the package...?""No.Now we have these chemically treated Q-Tips that we're to put in our ears. Absurd. Chemicals in the ear orifice.Could you get cancer from the chemicals now on this Q-Tip?Can't say ""no."""
3,no carpet pics?,"OK, I get the fact the ""in"" to Central Asia was the theme of carpet making and trade. It worked on that level to some extent but when he described various differing carpet making techniques and styles, I'd liked to have had a visual.That being said there is plenty of fodder here on the current geopolitical situation in that part of the world that makes for interesting reading. I just felt it was all over the map. Sometimes it was fascinating when he got into the history, both distant past and recent, of Afghanistan and the other -stans and Iran. He lost me with his conversations with refugees as they sort of all blurred together and I never got any sense of who was who. What they were saying was interesting but I just felt this book needed a better editor, that's all."
1,Packaging,"Very dissapointed with the packaging of this item. Arrived completely broken and didn't have any sign that was ""FRAGILE"" neither the right protection around each of the cristal flutes."
3,"Cristal D'Arques Longchamp Gold Flute, Set of 4","product was great - as described, in great condition - packaging could have been better - but it did arrive safely -"
4,steamy soap,We purchased this movie because my wife had read and liked the novel years ago and because we recently learned that the soundtrack and score was written by Antonio Carlos Jobim.The movie is O.K. - and the score is outstanding!
4,Worth the Money,"I got this set for 15 bucks at a local store cause I wanted to start fortune telling. It was worth the money, it comes with a little palm reading book that tells you the basics, a full set of tarot cards and a booklet that tells you what they mean and a very nice, durable (and pretty) cardbord box with little indents to store it all in. I got the set for lack of anything better around I thought ""hey a tarot cards a tarot card,"" later I learned I was wrong, you're suposed to pick a set that calls to you. After seeing a few sets of cards, I like this one the best, it's not the most detailed (The backgrounds are black) but the colors are bright and vivid, really lively and the art style is very fun. It suits me well, however if you want to get really good at reading I sugest you buy another book, ""The Illustrated Guide to the Tarot"" by Naomi Ozaniec is helping me out a lot (though I haven't finished it yet)..."
1,never received,"I have now waited over 2 months for this book and still have not received it, can you please refund my money!!!"
2,Looks pretty...but,"I bought this saw about a year and a half ago thinking it would save on rental fees. The table is warped which makes it impossible to get two pieces from one. The weight of the ""waste side causes it to drop and snap the tile. Leaving a rather large piece of scrap. Mk said no problem and a new table arrives only to be warped. In order to finish this job I'm back at the rental center. ""Made In The U.S.A."" Where is the quality control??? Idon't know if Mk is aware of the fact that this make both me and the MK Company look pretty bad in the eyes of my customers. But I do have to admit that the red color of the tool is pretty. I'll find someone to unload this on and will be looking at the imports very quickly. I'm losing time, money and not to mention wasting material."
5,Turbo or Bust!,"I absolutely love this product!! The turbo is the best. I can dry my hair in 1/2 the time I use to. I have thin hair so it never took long, and now it's even faster. I'm one who doesn't spend a lot of time in the morning getting ready for work as I love to sleep in and this dryer has made it even better for me! I do recommend this dryer!"
5,"Seekers of Truth, take a peek here","This has been one of the most inspirational and challenging books on spiritual philosophy I have ever read. With brilliant insight, Eugene Whitworth uses drama to explore his academic analysis of 9 major world mystical traditions and proposes a convincing unified theory of Truth and the soul's journey to Self-realization. WARNING: Christians may find this book offensive."
1,G2400HH by Karcher - may not be new.,"I received my first unit with some gas in the tank, some oil all over the inside of the box and a bad feeling that this was someones elses return. The replacement came the same way! I received a nice E Mail that the units are tested before shipping, this may be true, but if so they are also assembling the handles and then taking them apart as well. MIght be OK for a reconditioned unit, but I have yet to receive a new one."
5,If You Can Find A Copy Of This Cult Classic - BUY IT!!!,"This is the ultimate cult classic. It is very hard to find this DVD...but if you do...BUY IT! True horror fans will love this flick...the story of a truly insane maniac out to kill his family and anyone who stands in his way. It is rated NC-17 because the gore is extreme...totally extreme...JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT!!! LOL!!! I'm not sure as to why this gem is a pin in a haystack, but perhaps the extreme nature of true horror has scared distributors from moving this along. It will give you nightmares. Trust me. BUY IT!!!"
3,A bit of everything,"This book has a bit of everything. There is a section about wood, another of tools, a section about techniques and a section with projects. This book is like an abridged version of ""The Compete Book of Woodworking"" which has twice as many pages, is twice as thick and has twice as many projects."
1,Cheap rubber and doesn't Fit,"I recently lost my rubber piece from my phillips in ear earphones, and instead of buying a new pair i bought this set. It came a few days later and i came to realize, the rubber was cheaply made and very flimsy. It didn't fit in my ears as it kept dropping out because the rubber isn't sturdy enough to hold. Can't complain much cause its already such a cheap price, but if you want a better quality rubber ear piece, don't get these."
4,Great bud covers,"These are great replacement covers. unfortunately, they do not fit my phillips ear phones. I think they're for more the ""L"" style kind. Ya know, the ones that dangle out of your hear.. but if I did have that kind. they would work great!"
2,lol,This is junk lol I've bought these replacement earbuds for my soon to arrive Monoprice MEP-933. But for the price I shouldn't say much. Nuff Said.~Sunny
2,not that great,the smallest ear buds replacements do not fit the sony earbuds right and of cheaper quality than the orignal buds.
2,Just not the same....,"These earbuds had to be modified significantly to fit my Philips HN060 noise canceling ear buds.Modification aside, while the shape and size is similar to my original buds, the materials used are far inferior.These are stiffer and less comfortable, and seems to fit less snugly."
2,"Poor fit in ear, bad material","These replacements fit my Sennheiser CX300 earbuds fine, but they do a lousy job of fitting properly and sealing in my ear. The material is much stiffer than the original Sennheiser items, resulting in a very poor seal in the ear. As a result I lose a significant amount of base and the buds are constantly falling out of my ears during runs. I've tried the medium and large sleeves -- neither set works well.I wouldn't buy them again."
1,BEWARE SHIPPING & HANDLING,shipping & handling not like amazon... they'll ding you 4.98 PER ITEM. Amazon should censor them for such practices. see other reviews w same problem. Amazon products: GREAT. 3rd party provider products: BEWARE!
1,utter total garbage,I purchased these for my Shure 488.460 not only do they not fit but they are flimsy cheap rubber. They will not fit this model and they fit wierd in my ear and do not protect against sound like the standard ones. BEWARE
3,Not what I expected,"I have two pairs of Phillips noise cancelling ear bud headsets, both are discontinued so when I needed replacement bud covers it was extremely hard to find. The vendor advertises these buds for Phillips so I felt rather lucky, unfortunately they were not for my headsets. When I put them in they get stuck in my ear and I have to pull them out each time I take the headsets off. Not bad replacements just annoying; figured I'm still getting off easy since I don't have to buy new headsets."
1,Wrong item,"They sent me a kodak camera battery, aside from that I gave them one star because it got to my house on time."
4,Good replacement buds,My Sennheiser CX 300S earbuds had gotten pretty nasty and torn up so I decided to shell out the $4.50 for these babies.- I'm a pretty big guy but maybe I have small ear canals so only the smallest ones fit.- Overall I feel the quality and comfort is comparable to the originals I had.I wouldn't give these 5 stars because I can't imagine wearing the bigger earbuds and feel they could have cut down on cost a bit by just letting me purchase the one size that fits.Would by again if/when I need replacements. Recommended.
3,Disappointed,"I was very happy initially when I put these on my Sony earbuds, that is until I put them in my ears. I am very disappointed with this item. While they do fit tightly on the earbuds, they do not fit in my ears properly. The original Sony earbuds fit well and were a different silicone material than these are. These have a matte like finish that do not go into my ears like they should and as a result make the earbuds less noise cancelling. I find that I have to adjust them often and clean them everytime I put them in my ears because they collect earwax quickly. I would not purchase this product again. The price is outstanding, but not if they are not functional. I feel as if I threw money away."
5,replacement earbuds for sony,"These replacement earbuds fit well on my old sony earbuds that would always lose the rubber buds. I've had the sony's for quite awhile. I think they are the old mdr 51's, with one cord short and one cord long from the bifurcation in the wire. Too soon to know if these will fall off as easily, but at the price, it doesn't matter. The vendor, Generic, sent them quickly."
2,Magnet too strong for small electronics,This is a very nice set for working on cheep toys but DO NOT use this to repair iphones. The magnet can damage small electronics.
3,Diplomatic Courier,"Cesar Romero plays a diplomatic courier who makes a dangerous visit to a foreign city in each of these 4 black & white episodes. Titles are ""Geneva,"" ""Rome,"" ""Tangiers"" and ""Turkey.""Note that although this is identified as Volume 1, the manufacturer never released a Volume 2."
3,Front Page Training Video,"I'm a little disappointed in the quality of the video, especially detail work on-screen. It frequently has the characteristics of a home video camera being used to make a tape for a friend (slightly out of focus, grainy). The instructor is obviously very comfortable with the material but somewhat monotonous."
3,Out of date. Here is an alternative recommendation.,"I am the author/publisher. This reference was useful 15 years ago, but today it is out-of-date and out of print. -- Instead, if you want a current reference, I recommend the book by Donald Pipkin, ""Halting the Hacker: A Practical Guide to Computer Security (With CD-ROM)."" Pipkin's book is available here on Amazon.com. Also, check Amazon for Computer Security titles specific to your needs in networking, firewalls, identity theft or other aspects of security."
4,"great movie, not just for kids","I really enjoyed this movie, enough that I bought the DVD. My ""kids"" are in college, and they liked it, too. The special features were interesting, and the short feature was fun. My only complaint: Considering the upcharge for the 2 disc set, I would have expected a few more extras on the second disc."
5,A great family-friendly movie,"We were unable to see Megamind in the theater (my youngest son wouldn't dream of sitting still that long) so my oldest son literally jumped up and down when he saw Megamind on the counter. Both of my boys thoroughly enjoyed Megamind and neither of them moved the entire time the movie was playing. I just love when a movie captivates them like Megamind did. And the laughs.. I just love it! The following day, they watched the new action comedy Megamind: The Button of Doom with just as much attention. I just love how much action they pack into those little cartoons. Some of you may have seen Megamind: The Button of Doom on Nickelodeon recently too! My children watched it again when it aired. :)If you love comedy, and even if you don't have kids, you have got to see this movie. Megamind is hilarious, moving, and just outright fun. I love the star cast as well, especially Will Ferrel. He just gets me! My favorite part was when Minion was in the little pond at the end."
5,All new meaning to being a superhero,"Bought the movie because:a) Great trailerb) Don't get to the theaters, muchc) The kids asked for itd) FullHDI just watched the movie with the kids and we all enjoyed it very much. The action, comedy and animation were superb. I especially liked the way, it managed to fool me during the final battle and kept me guessing as to who was who in the fight. It was very inspiring especially when the message is - it is nice to be naughty but it is great to do right. There is also another message - live to your fullest potential, no matter what the odds are."
2,Terrible,"I love animated movies and was particularly interested in this one due to the high profile actors, but is was extremely disappointing to the point of giving me a headache.The story is a good one, but it never really gels enough for anyone to care. Finally, the viewer never buys into pulling for any of the characters. This is a major flaw. Who cares which characters make a surprise comeback as you didn't care when they left in the beginning. Plus, was Megamind that terrible to begin with? Maybe, but you had to search for clues to find out if you cared or not. Again, great story line but poorly developed."
1,NOT 3-D!,"I think it's HIGHLY DECEPTIVE for Amazon (not to mention the commercial I just saw) NOT to put, in BIG GIANT LETTERS....THIS IS NOT THE 3-D VERSION YOU SAW IN THEATERS!!! WHY even BUY it?! Also, quite a few other reviewers RAVE about the, NOT INCLUDED, 3-D in their reviews. BE MORE HONEST AMAZON!"
5,Megamind is an awesome adventure!,This movie is amazing. It's a great adventure and one of the best movies of 2010. One of my favorite movies that I have ever watched and the combo pack features two amazing movies. Very great deal!
5,Megamind Blu-ray/DVD Combo,"An awesome movie from beginning to end, Megamind is great for children and adults. The characters were funny and entertaining. Definitely an interesting take on the classic hero/villian relationship. I just wish this Two Disc Combo included a digital copy."
5,Honestly don't know why this film doesn't appeal to folks more than it does,"Animation has gotten so very expressive . I saw this for the second time this evening (the first was theatrically) . It's awesome on Blu-ray with the subtitles on . I think this film will gain a very solid following on home video . Perhaps not . I really love it though . i feel all the various talents involved came together extremely well and had a totally unique take on fairly weary (for me) super hero expectations . Lots of laughs , fun and quite singular ."
4,FUN MOVIE,This movie is so much fun. I believe the purchase was as much for me as it was my daughters. It is a good movie with entertainment for children and adults.
3,megamind review,"I had not seen this in a movie theater and I was really excited when it finally came out and I was able to buy it. However, I was disappointed of the plot. The evil Megamind character and his fish-assistant were great, but the city hero was just too typical:handsome, vain and selfish.I would give the plot 2 stars.The characters (Megamind and his assistant) 5 stars and the rest of the characters 2 stars.The plot I would give just 1 star because right from the beginning it was just like the Superman -story: the child from a distant planet is sent away to the earth, falls in love with a news reporter girl, has trouble telling about his love to her.With the Megamind character the screenwriters could have done a much more interesting and twining plot than this straight forward copy of a superman story."
3,DVD skips,"Love this movie. Saw in theaters. My daughter used her money to purchase this DVD. It skips. Very disappointed. Otherwise, would rate movie 5 stars."
3,Can be boring.,"Comment: Even though this was supposed to be a 3D ""event"", there is no Blu-ray 3D available to order at this time (02/2011). Being an adult I only buy these ""cartoons"" to experience the 3D. I found this movie to be... around the middle, boring. That is not to say it is a bad movie... but rather it is technically quite good. So are all the rest that have come before. So I must say that without the ""bang"" of the 3D effect... it is just another cartoon using the same old tried and true formula. Ho-hum."
3,Okay rating,"This is a blind buy for the family. I just watched this last night with my three kids ages 5 and 2 years old. My two year olds watched it half way then bailed (understandable based upon their age) but my son and I watched thru the entire thing. It is a pretty good movie. The storyline and humor is just okay, nothing really special. The casts are funny and great. IMO, it didn't bring the real humor of Will Ferrel. Probably I'm used to his adult comedy humor so this being a kids flick is definitely toned down. Brad Pitt is only there in the beginning and a little bit towards the en (oops, spoiler alert there). Had I watched it first in the theatre, I may have a second thought on buying it. Regardless, I'm not dissapointed, just content."
3,Mega minds,Bought movie because I expected it to be the same as it was in the theater with the 3D scenes. It is not. Amazon's description is misleading. I invited my grandkids over to watch a 3D movie..very disappointing .
2,unfair use of 3D versions,I'm not happy how they hold out the 3D version for promo sales of 3D TVs. I like the movie but really wanted the 3D version included with this pack.
4,MegaFun,"I wasn't too thrilled about going to see this with my daughter, but I'm glad I did. Will Ferrell lends his crazy sense of humor to this movie and between him and David Cross (Minion), the back and forth with them was great. With an all star cast of comedians, great animation and amazing picture on Blu ray, this is a must have. My kids love it for the silly humor and I must say, so do I."
5,A movie I don't mind watching with my toddler over and over...,"I never wanted to see this movie when it came out but one day we got it ""On Demand"" from our cable company for free so I put it on for my toddler...and he loved it. He watched it all the time until they removed it so now we own it. I know he doesn't care but I enjoy it much more with Blue Ray quality."
4,nice movie,I like this movie. I watched with my 4 year daughter but it was a bit too long for her. Also I have a Samsung Blue Ray player that it did not play it. Had to use DVD.
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES!,When I saw this movie it instantly became one of my favorites! Will Ferrel is one of my all-time favorite actors and he brings a great dimension to his character! The humor is GREAT!!! I couldn't stop laughing... I absolutely love this movie. I just wish it came with a digital copy!
4,Watchout for Zone 2 Idiosyncracy,"My previous receiver didn't have a zone 2 setting but allowed the rear 7.1 speakers to be rechanneled as the front speakers whose volume was controlled together with the 5.1 speakers. I used this for my remote speakers in my kitchen adjacent to the family room. The Onkyo receiver has a zone two setting which allows you to set up a second set of front speakers that can even have a separate input source and has a separate volume control. However, the input source must be analog! So those of us using HDMI or optical inputs for our DVD and cable must us another unused source e.g.,VCR) for the analog inputs and then set the zone 2 input to that source. You may run out of input sources quickly! Otherwise this unit works great! Warmer than others but not bothersome."
4,Smooth Onkyo Sounds,"I purchased this receiver to replace my Onkyo TX-SR700. I am very pleased with the 605, another outstanding product from Onkyo. The main reason I replaced my 700 was for the new surround formats. Toshibas new HD-A30 carries these formats via HDMI. The sounds are as great as the images on the screen! This is a nice receiver for mid-sized rooms (my room is 12x20). I would recommend the Onkyo 705 or 805 for larger rooms, as this receiver lacks a power punch. Other than that, I would give this one five stars. Onkyo makes a great receiver, I highly recommend anyone looking for a new one should try any one of Onkyos' new line."
4,Excellent HDMI capable AV receiver,"The receiver is easy to setup and sounds great. The receiver has a handy onscreen programming capability and comes with a microphone that can be used for automatic speaker calibration. You'll still have to tweak the sound settings after the auto setup, but it will get you closer faster than you could otherwise, especially if you're a novice. This unit could do with some more inputs (There are only 2 HDMI in, and 3 Component Video Input slots), but with some creative input juggling you can connect a fair number of components as the receiver allows you to assign which input goes to which component. The receiver does put out a fair amount of heat, so be sure to place it in a well-ventilated location. Also, you will lose the video for a few seconds when switching inputs or when switching video resolutions on the same input, but I don't see that as a big negative."
2,Mine was partially DOA,"I suspect that this is a super good value when it works. Mine had a dead channel and I therefor couldn't get through the Audissey setup, much less enjoy the features.Amazon service was superb. My RMA was processed very quickly and the return and refund process was totally painless."
4,Excellent value,I have used Onkyo TXSR605 for about three weeks now. I believe it is an excellent value for the money spent. I have not tested the HDMI (1.3) switching capabilities yet.
5,The Best receiver in the market for the money - go fo it,"This is the best HDMI receiver you could buy for the money.I did extensive research in buying a receiver and finally decided on this.the decesion making points were1.Performance 5-Stars2.Quality 5-Stars3.Cost 5-StarsI got this couple of months ago and waited to write the review. I am so impressed with this reciver.I am using with the following configurationPolk 6750 - Center , Back LR, Surround LR, SUBPolk R50 pair - Front LRPhilips 14 gauage cable.The total cost for me to set up was under $800 (including Receives and Speakers)Recently I upgraded my TV to 42"" 1080p the receiver worked excellent.Bottom line is with this receiver you can easly set up an excellent home theater and go for it."
5,works great,Product works great. Some difficulty in setup due to menus. Produces sound very well and handles hdmi magnificently. Nice job Onkyo. Highly recommended.
4,Terrific sound with HDMI 1.3a,"Have this for 6 months now and sounds wonderful with my Mirage Nanostat speakers and 5year old Onkyo subwoofer with both movies and concerts.---Update 9/11/08 with my new 52in Sony LCD TV:However, when I play a DVD movie that's in 4:3 through the Onkyo, the output to my Sony 52in KD52V4100 HDTV via HDMI connection, the picture looks squished vertically (with black bands on top and bottom of screen) so people look fat. When I play a 4:3 movie format from the DVD directly to the TV (without going through the Onkyo), the people look fine."
4,I would like one more input,"Overall, you just can't beat this for the money. I would like to see one more hdmi input for future expansion...Get this and a good set of polk surround speakers and a dayton sub and you will have a $3000 dollar sound for under a grand"
5,Onkyo 605,Onkyo TX-SR605S 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver (Silver)I had this up and running in very little time. I could not be more pleased with the sound quality and features. I just realised that my tone/bass settings were at 0. My other systems had to be maxed on tone/bass for them to sound decent. The audio is very crisp and clear.Only complaint is that the speaker connectors are bunched close and it was hard to connect the wires. Looked like the 705/805 fixed this.
4,Good for money,"I am satisfied with my new Onkyo receiver, it eats up all inputs and gives one HDMI output. My TV is now hanging with only one cable. Sound distribution is good but the only complain is I have to go about 60 volume level when I watch a movie. Over all it is good bet for the price I paid."
4,Great Receiver for the money,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this receiver, but having great success with Onkyo receivers in the past, it was more of which model to buy. I considered this, and getting last years 674 model at a closeout price. While the 674 had an extra HDMI port, what really sold me on this one was the HD sound capability which leads me to believe I will be able to use this one for a couple of years. It's biggest benefit over my old receiver is the ability to plug multiple items into the receiver and use the HDMI upconverting to transfer the signal to the TV without having to switch TV inputs. I have it hooked up with 5.1 surround and used the Audessey to calibrate the speakers and the sound is really great. It works great with my ""old"" HDTV as well as my HD Tivo and it is a great upgrade over my old Onkyo from 7 years ago. I would definitely recommend this receiver to my friends"
4,Great Receiver,"This is a great receiver. My set up is as follows:Sony XBR2 televisionPolk Audio RM6750 5.1 speakersDISH Network HD DVR VIP622Philips VCR/DVD PlayerI have HDMI connection from satellite receiver to Onkyo receiver for video and optical cable for audio. I've connected by DVD player via component video to the Onkyo and audio via digital coaxial.The setup was pretty straight forward even though this was my first surround sound system. The automatic speaker calibration program worked great. I have only one complaint and that is that I have to crank up the volume (to about 45 or 50) in order to get decent sound. This may have something to do with my set up but I also cannot always get voices to be loud without having background music loud.Overall, I'm very satisfied and would recommend this receiver."
4,"Great ""bang for the buck!""","The Onkyo TX-SR605 is the least expensive receiver on the market at this time that supports all next-generation audio codecs; even able to decode Dobly TrueHD & DTS-HD Master Audio received via HDMI.HDMI upconversion is terrific and works as advertised... just don't confuse up-conversion with upscaling which can only be accessed through a hidden menu and doesn't... well... work.Aesthetically, the case/chassis is attractive but without the up-market feel of Pioneer Elite or Yamaha receivers. The OSD is better than some, but feels unsophisticated overall.If you have the funds, I would recommend springing for the TX-SR805, but if you are on a budget then do consider this receiver."
5,Great Receiver -- Especially for the price,"I bought the SR605 about a month ago, and I've been very pleased with the ease of setup, functionality, and overall sound quality. The setup is intuitive, and I didn't even find it necessary to use the manual. My setup is as follows:1) DirecTV - HDMI in to HDMI out2) Xbox 360 - Component in to HDMI out3) Mac Mini - HDMI in (DVI to HDMI cable) to HDMI out -- still using RCA for audio here, but will upgrade to a mini toslink to sp/dif cable soon. I wish there was some way to get the audio on the HDMI cable, but if it's possible, I haven't figured out how to do it yet.Using this setup, the only complaint I have is that the video switching takes a few seconds to switch, but that's a very minor complaint. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this receiver."
4,Very Good Product,"I have owned Onkyo products in the past(amps, pre-amps, receivers, etc). They seem to last forever. This Onkyo entry is all that it appears to be. It reproduces sound--all HD formats--flawlessly. It has two HDMI inputs, and one HDMI output to the TV. There is no picture degradation. It can be set up in less than 30 minutes. The remote can be programmed by the Harmony Remote series. I wish only that it was a little more powerful (perhaps 110 watts per channel instead of 90). Still, the sound, even at lower volumes, is crisp and clean."
4,onkyo tx-sr605,"Great value for a full-featured digital receiver. Not high end sound but damn good for small change. Amazon was great to do biz with.... first one shipped fast but UPS ""lost"" it and delivered to wrong apt. Amazon quickly sent another which arrived promptly no problem."
1,Not as anticipated,"I returned this for the following reasons: 1 - Only this only one out there that downscales 1080i signal from component source to 720p. 2 - Low sound. 3- I cannot tell which speakers are active in any given listening mode, I thought there is a way to tell this somewhere in the setup, nada. 4 - Cannot output 5.1 PCM to 7.1 channels."
3,Didn't love the sound quality,"This unit is capable of doing a ton of connections and has a good deal of control. But, I don't care for the sound quality that much. It is missingsome nice round bass response and overall sounds a little flat to my ears. You can adjust the eq section, but it moves in 2db increments and there is no mid range control on the front panel tone adjustment. If you aren't using a sub woofer and want great sound, I would consider something else. I am being critical here, but I did prefer the Harmon Kardon that I replaced this with -as far as quality of sound goes, and it makes me wish I returned this unit to Amazon."
4,Does a great job for 99.9% of people,"I am a guy who is really into gadgets and gizmos. I also appreciate quality electronics and good value. This receiver is probably the best value you will find although I wish it had a few more HDMI inputs. Everything else does exactly as it says it does.OK, here is a comment of 0.1% of people out there, the amp in this - while adequate - has trouble producing midrange and there is the slightest interference from the transformer. You will have to really be an audiophile to notice any of this - and then probably only with fairly high end speakers. I only noticed it with headphones.Oh, and don't forget that this thing is HUGE. Make sure to measure twice, order once."
4,Onkyo SR605,"Onkyo SR605 is a quality receiver for the price. I highly recommend it for those people who don't want to spend a lot for a receiver, but want high quality sound. It can be a little difficult hooking up the connections if you are putting the receiver in a cabinet."
3,Sounds great but it runs hot!,"Great features for a receiver in this price point. Surround modes sound good and the HDMI switching capability is excellent.Occasionally I have some strange video issues where the picture (regardless of source)will start jumping around the screen and the only way to fix it is to turn the receiver off and on again.My only complaint after owning this for a few months is that it gets hot! I mean really hot, if it's been on for any length of time you can't touch the top of the receiver with your bare hands. If you have good air flow in your entertainment center then i say go with this unit, if however you have a closed off area or plan on putting other devices on top of the receiver then i would look at other options.Good value for the money"
4,good deal,"this is a good price for my first receiver,i compere all item.i still like this one,when it open for a while,it will be a little hot"
3,"Great sound, but the video processing stinks","I bought this for my newly purchased KEF KHT2005.2 speakers. Hooked everything up, and started the setup. It was fairly easy to set up. I'd never did this before, and I didn't even have to read the instructions. I had two HD sources hooked to it via the HDMI ports, with one HDMI out going to my TV. The sound was outstanding! Crystal clear. But, the video processing wasn't good. It made my HD-DVD's look soft on the edges, and my DirecTV that outputs at 420p look like a movie a bought off iTunes. It wasn't good. I'm taking it back to get something without the video processing. Don't need to pay for something I'm not going to use."
5,Still the best bang for the buck HDMI receiver,"Compared with the coming wave of HDMI v1.3 receivers, this Onkyo not only beats the market with a head start but also beats them with value. I noticed that a number of upcoming/recently shipping budget HDMI v1.3 receivers lack important advanced audio decoding capabilities such as DTS-HD and Dolby THD. Even used as a pre-amp alone the SR605 still offers incredible value for its features.However, buyer should be aware that there are no currently shipping players that can stream DTS-MA or D-THD signals (but should be coming soon) and it is not known if these features are working correctly at this moment. In addition, cooling is important for SR605 onwers as these receiver do run warmer than other brands."
1,Poor Build Quality,"The HDMI 2 input did not work from the beginning. Onkyo's service department had me reset the amp, which fixed HDMI 2 for a few days. Now it's in the shop for warranty work.This experience makes me wonder what else doesn't work. Will 7.1 work when if I buy an extra pair of speakers? How about zone 2 ouput or component inputs? I have not tried these out, but I'll definitely need to see what else is broken.If you buy one of these, test *everything* thoroughly before the retailers exchange grace period expires! Don't assume that the HDMI connections will work down the road when you are ready to upgrade."
2,Disappointed,"I am generally satisfied with the operation of the receiver. (I have not tested its HDMI capabilities though.) But it exhibits a problem that I have not read about in any reviews. The problem is that after it is on for a time (say, approximately 30 minutes) at a volume level of 40, or so, it shuts down (and the standby light continually flashes) when the volume is changed by at least 2 increments, increase or decrease. This occurs even without any wires (speakers and other component) connected to it. I have talked to Onkyo technical service a couple of times. Their diagnosis was that its protection circuitry was malfunctioning. They recommended that I take/send it back to the dealer that I bought it from for exchange, or refund."
4,satisfied,"After reading other reviews of this product I decided to buy it in hopes of being satisfied with it's performance. I should have been more skeptical. I spent five hours setting this receiver up. The ""Audessey"" set-up didn't work after several tries. So I gave up and manually set up the speakers. After one week the receiver started picking up the infrared signal from my cable box remote. Every time I changed a TV channel the surround mode on the receiver changed too. What the heck!! Needless to say, It's back in the box on it's way back to the store.Updated:After sending the first receiver back for issues described above, it turns out the cable box was the culprit, not the receiver.Actually, the receiver has been a solid performer since I bought it. Good value for the money!"
5,Going Strong after 4 years,"Great product that has provided quality sound for over 4 years. As other reviews have stated, the product does get warm, but I have it in a fairly open area so it has never been a problem. Great price with all the needed features at the time of purchase. Wish it did have a couple more hdmi in ports."
3,Onkyo receiver,"This receiver worked well initially, easy set up, good quality sound through my B&W; speaker system. Was a little dissappointed that it only had 2 In HDMI, and 1 out.Now after about 2 years I started to get static when changing channels with Cable remote. Changed cable box and HDMI cord(actually sent HDMI cord back to monster, got a new one but still had the same problem). About 2.5 years out the #2 HDMI port gave out completely, so had to use 5 wire?composite for cable in.Very frustrating.Onkyo TX-SR605 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black)"
2,"I thought it was great, until it started to fall apart","This model had it all - all the features you could want. I posted a glowing review back in 2007 when I bought it. Well, I just sold its dead carcass on eBay for $55 (July, 2011). First the subwoofer output died, then the right channel started dying randomly, then the sound would cut out entirely, and finally it would just turn itself off randomly. It had nothing to do with volume or temperature as far as I could tell. The problems got much worse shortly after the warranty expired until it would sometimes turn on and sometimes not. It seems like they tried to pack too many goodies in for the price."
4,Great sound and great features!,I received this shipment faster than expected. The receiver performs really well and it has all the features that I wanted. I connected them to Polk audio R50 and CSi3 speakers and the sound quality is really awesome.I really wish that it was a little more integrated with the PC though in this day and age. I use my PC to play downloaded shows and I had to purchase a SPDIF USB audio dongle to get it to decode Dolby and the like.
1,steer clear of this nightmare!,"Amazing features at this price point, however the unit has known HDMI problems that must be addressed. It's not compatible with alot of other products because of the HDMI ver 1.3 and the HDCP and there isn't a solution other then just run a HDMI from DVD to TV and a Fiber optic from DVD to RCVR. The setup is OK but Yamaha is much easier and user friendly. Bottom line is sound is good, the features are useless using HDMI. That's why we went to HDMI isn't it ? 1 cord for A&V. Buy the Yamaha HTR 6060 or 6090 or RX-v 1800 and plug and play the way it's suppose to be."
2,weak power,tyhis thing over heats and barely can power a decent speaker set such as NHT's dont get onkyo unless 110x7
1,No Picture,This is my first Onkyo product. I spent a long time undoing all the wires from my existing receiver and setting up this Onkyo. When I finally got everything all set up I wasn't able to get a picture from the HDMI output. I contacted Onkyo and they said that as long as I had a HDMI cable running from the HDMI out on the receiver to the HDMI in on my TV there was no reason I shouldn't be able to get the onscreen setup menu. Since I was no the receiver was likely defective. I returned the unit to Amazon for a refund without any problems. First impressions are very important to me. When a solid state product arrives without any signs of packaging damage or wear and it doesn't work right out of the box I get concerned about that companies quality standards.
4,Nice reciever with a few flaws,"I purchased this reciever because of the price point and the features it offered. There is no other reciever in this price range that has analog video conversion to HDMI. It took some calls to Tech Support to get my XBox 360 working via the HDMI input. I had to re-set the reciever in order to get it to work even though I followed the directions perfectly. I later found out that running the Audessey setup caused my HDMI from my XBox to stop working again and had to reset the reciever and then manually adjust the speaker settings based off of what the Aydessey had setup previously. Other than that, a great reciever for the money if you can overcome the little nuances."
1,Junk,"I got one of these a while back. I don't have any complains with video or sound when it works. The problem is it rarely works.Everything started out great. Then I would be watching something and there would be a pop and the sound would completely cut out. I could usually change the input and it would come back on. Sometimes I'd have to power down and back up, or unplug it and it would start working again. Unfortunately I believed this was related to the input so I didn't really do anything about it.As the time progressed the problem became more frequent, and at this point it's stopped functioning all together. Mine was already out of warranty before I even started looking into doing something about it so shame on me, although it doesn't sound like the warranty support is any good anyway.I'd stay away from this product if I were you. :-/"
2,Very HOT unit....,"After lots of research, and some great reviews here on Amazon and the AVS Forum, I decided upon the Onkyo 605 receiver. It has run perfectly and sounded great, however, this thing is so hot, it almost makes you worry about it being a fire hazard.Just the other day I opened my entertainment unit to watch a movie. My Onkyo was on standby, and even on standby, you could literally have fried an egg on this thing. I'm assuming that it has protection circuitry that cuts the unit off in the even of overheating, but as hot as it was, it would have to be melting the metal to hit this limit. I was also concerned with teh Blu-ray player that I had on the next shelf up, as the shelf itself was scorching.I now just unplug the unit when not in use, but I think that I'm going to be replacing with a much cooler Denon. Maybe I don't have enough ventilation in my cabinet, but my old Kenwood never got even close to being this hot in the same cabinet."
4,Connection to Octigon Switch,I am using this unit with a Tivo and a Octigon 3X8 switch all on HDMI. I could not get the HDMI output to my TV to work with the switch however it worked great connected to the TIVO. I connected the Onkyo HDMI input to my switch and the connected the TV also directly to the switch. That worked great (good thing I only have 7 TVs).
3,Good for Lower end Unit,The component switching sux. Has good sound though.Sometimes the Unit switches off for no reason. Sound setup isvery easy.
4,"Great For Decorating, But Not For Painting","There was not much to do with the painting of murals included in this book at all. The title is rather misleading. If, however, you are interested in beautiful illusions in sculpture and decorating, this would be the perfect place."
2,Skip this one,"I consider Willcock's Carols For Christmas CD one of the finest ever recorded, and I even own the companion book from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. So, why not a DVD of a performance tied into the same material?Alas, the video is not even high quality for the standards of the time. Some of the songs don't even have the video and audio synchronized. So, stick to CD recordings of David Willcocks plus anyone, but I can't recommend the DVD here."
4,Elmo Vest 3T-4T,Product was in great condition but ran a little bigger in size than a 4T. It was wearable and well worth it for one day of great trick or treating and partying for a three year old.
5,Back Home,"Bill Mauldin shows a remarkable clarity and insight not only in his cartoons but also in his written commentary on them. He shows high regard for the soldiers' well being and compassion for what they (and he) endured. He highlights their readjustment problems, especially in regard to the lack of appreciation from apparently quite a few civilians as to the sacrifices the soldiers made in the war."
4,well balanced practical information,"it provides a range of simple yet effective routines and actions. It also covers on diet recommendations. Overall very simple information, but practical for a novice."
3,Nothing too special,"It's a small book, like fit into the back pocket of your jeans and you may not notice small.However, its got some good exercises that you can get, by looking online.I rate it 3 stars, because I often go to places where I have no internet, and this is good for me to take with me."
1,Very poor book. I recommend a yoga program.,This book was a waste of money. I bought a Bodylastics Resistance band set and a 3 dvd yoga for beginners set and they are much better for not having a gym membership or gym equipment at home.
3,Old School,"This book was OK but nothing that a person with any knowledge of body weight exercise wouldn't already know. The exercises were all basic pushups pullups situps and body weight squats that included some variations of each exercise. It also had some plyo. type exercises and stretching advice, but again, nothing that most seasoned fitness people wouldn't already know to some degree. I purchased the book hoping that it would include some hard endurance type workouts but that was not the case. There is workouts included but just not what I was looking for, but for someone else they might be great.Overall, if you're looking for a book that provides some body weight exercises to get yourself in shape this book will work for you, however you may have to up the intensity of the workouts depending on what kind of shape you are in presently."
2,"Some nice pictures of tiles, but . . .",I was disappointed that the book contains only one picture of the mosque's interior -- and only a partial one at that.
4,GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE $,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT, ONLY PROBLEM IS ALSO A GREAT THING... THE BATTERY IS BUILT IN, YOU CHARGE IT BY YOUR COMPUTER, BUT IT ALSO DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG... PICK YOUR POISON! LIKE IT ALOT, HOLD LOTS OF SONGS!"
1,Useless,I contacted this company a week ago. I have not received a response. This MP3 player will not download into my computer. We are running Windows XP which is listed as compatable. It is obviously not.
3,I agree....,I totally agree. These stickers do not stay where you put them. I use them to put prices on existing paper labels. I have to use scotch tape to keep the Avery stichers where they belong.
3,Good for very temporary use,"Although the product is an excellent idea its reliability to stay stuck for more than one week when placed on the spine of a book, with various types of covers, is spotty at best."
4,Very basic but durable,I bought this as a gift for my husband. My husband is very hard on clothes but this shirt held up for almost 4 years. Very basic.
2,"Reprint, Canadian History","This is a reprint produced by Kessinger Publications. The pages are copied py something similar to Xerox. The cover is generic, having only title and author and Kessinger advertisments. The map on page one and everything after page 183 is missing (apparently this means only the last two or three pages).As for content, the book is a memoir of an Anglican minister on western Hudson Bay from about 1800-1900, and is therefore of interest mainly to local historians. Since it is one of the large number of personal memoirs produced during the age of high imperialism the general reader might benefit by reading three or four of them to be reminded of how much we have gained - and lost."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Haynes Johnson’s latest work takes you into the nineties. A decade where the market soared and technology boomed. A decade when scandal seemed to be on everyone’s mind and on everyone’s TV.A good portion of this book involves Clinton and his escapades. Other portions talk about technology and its affect on everything from the sciences, where the genome is being mapped, to the Internet, and its web over the country. The popularity of scandal TV and reality TV get quite a bit of mention also. From the O.J. debacle to the Monica story. Is it the dumbing down of the media for the public or the other way around?Johnson has summarized the nineties fairly well. This brief history covers quite a bit of territory and is written in a concise and readable way.If you’ve kept up with the times, you won’t learn anything new here, but it will bring back some either good or bad memories."
2,Dvorak never think of an Animal named Internet,"Just think off an expert that proudly claimed as speculative fortune teller who knows a little bit about DOS and Edlin, then after talking alot of the future of computing but never mention one word about the Internet. Stupid"
5,Great Job!!,"Wow! I am really impressed with this book. I particularly like that the exclusives are mixed in with the regular line stuff, so you see all of the bears grouped together. And I love the fact that they included the really old stuff that a lot of us collectors didn't even know about before visiting Boyds Bear Country. I have been collecting for 7 years. I also buy a lot of Boyds off eBay, so I really appreciate the realistic secondary market values that this book provides. I highly recommend this book to anyone who collects Boyds Bears!"
3,Boyds Tracker,"With over 400 bears, in my collection, this book is ok. It needs to have all the pictures in alpha order to include the camera shy critters. It does include all the exclusives, which helps from bouncing back and forth. A better ""Current Price"" for value, instead of a range, would be helpful. I loved the pawnotes. I also bought the CD verision and probably would not buy that again unless they greatly improve the software. I guess overall it's better than nothing."
4,Plush Collectors,"I really like the Boyds Tracker for Plush Animals, and can't wait for the Resin one. I really like how this book contains both early pieces and current ones. In the CheckerBee publishing book, there was a place at the bottom of each page to record both the edition number and the price paid for each piece of my collection. If this book had that feature, as far as I'm concerned, it would be perfect! (That's why 4 stars instead of 5)"
4,Plush Animal Details,"This book is invaluable not only for experienced collectors, but also for the beginners and even pre-beginners. It is very detailed, with abbreviations for series and exclusive series, and states how the publisher gets the listings, and the publisher's history. The changes in styles and variations of the plush pieces over the years, fun facts, `rumors', and interesting tidbits, are described. There is a Paw Notes section at the end of the book that has information on particular pieces. The main `text' of the book, of course, is listings of decoys, bears, and critters. Each listing has a clear, colorful picture with name, ID/number, size/height, retirement year if retired, if it is not retired, states `current', and value/price. It also mentions specifics like `old face' etc. An avid collector may be all too familiar with specific characteristics, but this book is extremely helpful to the newcomer to get familiarize with the plush animals in great detail."
3,Not QUITE like the Checkerbee books,"I sent this book back, because I was looking for a VALUE guide that was more recent than the Checkerbee one I have (2001) Checkerbee no longer makes them and I thought this one was similar. It was good for IDENTIFYING the various animals, but did not have current values for a lot of them. Sad day."
2,Very Limited,From the information I thought there would be a few other types of bears in the book for comparison but the book was very limited. It contained only Boyd's bears and I guess that was not at all what I was looking for. I look for a cross section of bears.
4,Great for Deryni fans,"It is hard to accept that Katherine Kurtz introduced readers to the Deryni universe over thirty years ago because of how fresh and current the DERYNI TALES' stories remain. Though the octet of tales from other authors besides Ms. Kurtz comes from Deryni Archives: the Magazine, they retain their excitement and offer proof to how robust the mythos remains. Ms. Kurtz provides an engaging new story to add to the overall strength of the collection. DERYNI TALES is clearly for long time friends who have already fallen under the charm of the series. New readers are better suited to start with the novels for fuller understanding though this collection provides a well written taste of Deryni.Harriet Klausner"
5,Fan Fiction at its Best!,"In Deryni Tales, Katherine Kurtz has pulled together 8 of the best fan-written stories dealing with her Deryni universe. The stories are not only well worth reading, but showcaes the talent and devotion of these Deryni fans. There is also a story by Kurtz herself in the volume, reason alone for having the book, but all of the stories are more than worthwhile reads. If you have read the Deryni series and enjoyed it, you owe it to yourself to read these additional Tales."
4,Deryni Tales from the Deryni Archives,"A fine collection of some of the best offerings from the Deryni Fan community. These tales, originally published in the Magazine _Deryni Archives_, have now been polished and re-worked into a fine fan anthology. Ms. Kurtz also presents a new short tale of her own in this volume.Among this collection are some wonderful tales from author's I sincerely hope to see in print again soon. Lohr Miller's _Lover to Shadows_, a piece about Charissa's private life, is worth the price alone. Frankly I cannot praise this piece too highly.Arilan the Talmud Student, addresses the subject of Jews in Gwynedd. A thought provoking and well written tale.I could go on and on, but simply put there is not a tale in this volume not worth reading. If only to see how the universe is envisioned, or perhaps more aptly put, expanded upon by a group of very fine writers.I can but hope that one day a Volume II will be published."
2,Like Reading About Driving From Boston to New Hampshire?,"The hero does a lot of driving back and forth in the course of the book and just how interesting can you make that? The PI's client, the wife with the missing hubby, seems a lot less upset about the whole thing than our hero. he trys to dive deep into the mystery without much support from her. The hero also needlessly withholds information from the police that would assist in their investigations. None of his cooperation would cross the line on client confidentially. It wasn't an awful book but it dragged and there wasn't much of a payback at the end for all that mundane story telling."
2,Disappointed,"I had been excited when I ordered the helmet because I had been looking for a blue helmet that would fit my small head. I had tried on a black XXS in this same helmet in my local bike shop, so I was sure this helmet would fit. Instead, it was HUGE when I put it on, at least 2 sizes larger than a XXS even though there was a tag inside saying it was a XXS. I contacted the seller and told him what happened. He made me pay for both his shipping costs and mine when I sent it back, I lost about half the cost of the helmet in this deal when the problem was not something I had done or could control. I wanted the helmet, but I wanted one that would fit. I had hoped the seller would check the helmet size and realize I was speaking the truth, but it was not to be. I was disappointed in both the sizing of the helmet and the seller in this purchase."
4,a great book,i liked this book because it kept me interested in the plot at all times. It is one of the better books I have read
4,Excellent but not essential,"4 Satin is another great release from Mogwai. ""Superheroes of BMX"" is one of the more rocking tracks they have put out, while ""Now You're Taken"" is possibly their most beautiful song. Aidan from Arab Strap contributes haunting words and the music is top notch. ""Stereo D"" is very unimpressive, though, eight minutes of lurching without any progress. The unlisted 11 minute closer is noisy but intriguing. In many ways, this is a good introduction to the many facets of Mogwai, although Young Team is still better for newcomers."
4,Mogwai-4Satin,"This is a very good album. I thought ""My Father, My King"" was a better E.P. but this is still worth having. Such a beautiful band."
3,For Mogwai Fans Only,"I own the 3 track version of this EP. ""Superheroes of BMX"" and ""Now You're Taken"" are both very good tracks. Stereodee starts out nicely for the first three minutes but then turns into 10 minutes of noise which is in all honestly simply annoying. Unless you're very artsy, you won't appreciate it either. If you're just starting out with this band, Young Team and Come on Die Young are better choices as is their latest EP."
1,very poor quality,"I don't think Very Good condition is a good label -- only about 3 minutes of each track could be imported, and with skips throughout. Waste of money."
5,Great choice,"Just what I needed for my ""short"" wife. Compact, sturdy and Rubbermaid quality. Great price."
2,"Rubbermaid 4209 EZ Step Folding Stool, 2-Step, Metallic Cylinder","I am not very happy with the way it arrived. It was missing one of its rubber feet, and I am afraid it will scratch my wood floors so I do not use it at all."
5,Rubbermaid Folding Step Stool,"I purchased the Rubbermaid 4209 EZ Step Folding Stool to keep in my walk-in closet. The shelves in the closet are too high for me to reach so I decided this stool would be the perfect solution and I was right. Its very slim size when folded up allows me to stand it out of the way in the closet and yet at easy access when needed. It is extremely sturdy and holds a pretty hefty weight limit, too. I love this stool."
4,good step,"Rubber Made step stool is a first class product and works great when a quick pick me up is needed -- That's a pun, son. Anyhow it is a quality product as you would expect from this Co."
2,Not for Everybody,"I was hoping for something that would be appropriate for a slightly arthritic woman who weighs 250 pounds (well below the 300 pound limit listed for this stool.)When she stepped on the first step of the stool, the feet splayed ever so slightly. In addition, the first step is too narrow to provide secure footing. No doubt this is a good buy for lighter, more agile people, but not good for people who are fit enough to climb a step stool, but need it to be very sturdy & ample."
1,CAUTION,"I had really liked my EZ Step Folding stool until a recent incident has prompted me to caution its users. My husband was standing on the stool when it came apart in 3 pieces and caused him to fall and suffer serious injury. His injury did require surgery and a long period of rehab, and we feel that this caution is needed for others using this product."
1,Avoid it!!,I purchased one of these from a home center (blue not orange). I used it get access to a storage room in my house about 24 inches above the basement floor. Last night while carrying my christmas tree stand I stepped on it and it broke into at least 20 pieces. I ended up on the floor. This is junk and you should avoid it. You are much better off with a metal version.
4,Nice little stool!,"This stool is very handy! Quite big and taller than I expected, but once I got used to it, I realized that I like it much better than the one step folding stool. Glad I bought it!"
5,A boost when we need one...,"We love our step-stool. Believe it or not, we take it along in our horse trailer everywhere we go. It's light, but sturdy and gives us the boost we need to get on our tall horses."
3,Not what I expected,"This step ladder is presented as ""slim."" which was my major consideration, because I wanted it to be kept handy in a small space near my work are. It's not so slim, especially because a step sticks out beyond the profile when its folded, and therefore it takes up more room than I would have expected. For most purposes I find it easier to pull out my old reliable metal stool."
4,very sturdy step stool,"This stool is a handy height and feels very secure underfoot. It folds to a compact upright size, but is just a little bit tricky remembering where to fold it at."
5,good folding stool at a great price,"The weight, size, and height of this stool are perfect for around the house usage. It opens and folds very easily. It stands on its own legs when folded, thus you don't need a wall to lean it against when not in use."
2,Not looking good.,I was disappointed when I received this step. This looks rather inelegant and much bigger than I had expected. I cannot understand why the reviews are so high??
5,The best dessert book! A working mom's dream!!!,"I just love this cookbook! The recipes are SO easy and the results are outstanding. I am in charge of desserts for all family get togethers and I'm also a working mom. This can sometimes get a little hairy! But I turn to this book time after time and find something easy to make. And EVERYONE raves about my baking! It's not me, it's this book! I've ordered four more becuase my family keeps borrowing mine. Everyone is getting one for Christmas this year - so keep your hands off mine, MOM!"
5,The Best!,We have seen every season and own them all. CSI Miami is one of our favorites. David Carruso is great as H. Like the whole cast.
1,CSI Miami,According to the info on this season posted they have 1 disc and it is only 43 mins thats why i have not ordered it yet.
3,"Interesting interviews, poor editing","The book features very interesting stories of South African women, but suffers from a lack of editing. The author continually interrupts each story to provide interpretation and background, which breaks the flow. Although the author's commentaries are needed, they could have been added at the end, to allow each woman tell her story uninterrupted. There are also so many stories featured, its hard for the reader to separate one from the other. The author also uses the apartheid-era race classifications to separate the book into sections, which is useful in some sense but its simplistic: its not that that easy to make a ""cross section"" of all women in South Africa."
3,Little Red Riding Hood Revisited,"This was a very good book. I liked the Little Red Riding Hood twist to it. The Heroine, Molly is a sweet, giving, innocent, loving girl who meets up with the Wolf(thats his name) while walking to her grandmother's house. Wolf is a man who has lived the past 7 years being ridiculed and shunned by stangers and even his so called friends. He is determined not to love Molly. Not even to need her. He marries her with the intention of just bedding her and then leaving and going back to his life in NYC, but somewhere along the way Molly gets under his skin. He suddenly finds that he does need her and takes her along with him to NY. They have many obstacles to over come before they can find the love that they both need to survive. I enjoyed this book and will probably by more of Linda Jones's books."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"This is the first novel that I have read by the author, and it will be the last. Linda Jones needs to work on her writing skills. The book had potential, unfortunatly the weak dialogue and plot resulted in me putting the book down without finishing it. I wouldn't recommend buying."
1,Junk,"I bought two of these nailers, the first one leaked air out of the trigger the first time I attached an air hose. I returned it and bought another. It worked great for about a week. Then it started to jam every other nail load. It started to leak air. I finally got so mad I threw it off the roof in to a dumpster. Piece of garbage, buy a Senco, or hitachi."
1,Don't buy this gun....,"Day 1...gun misfires and frequently jams. Later in day gun fails to fire at all. Day 2 Return gun purchased on Day 1. New gun fires but jambs frequently. Unjamming of gun annoying and not tool free.Until Dewalt gets its act together, purchase a tried and true Hitachi which is what i did on Day 3."
3,Jams hard to clear,"Several carpenters have used this on jobsite, all encountered frequent jams. Nails double feed. Half hour with needle nose, screwdriver, old sawzall blade, to clear. Good framing tool but depth adjust not fine enough for decking over PT. Either above surface or punches too deep. I would spend the extra and get gun with tool free clearance mechanism.Keep your hammer handy if you buy this model."
4,DEWALT D5184,"Bought this product a few weeks ago- thinking of getting one for more uses. Have been using to build a deck in a machine shed. Worked just fine for a day or two, then thought I blew an O-ring in the trigger (leaking air). Turns out my compressor valve stuck to a point that it wouldn't recharge, causing the gun to act strange. I think it's a great gun, but I don't care for the plastic collated nails that need to be used in conjunction. To me they feel more brittle and break apart easier than paper-locked clipped heads. The gun will let you know if you need more air. It won't put one in, or one all the way. I also don't care for how the dry-fire lockout still contains at least 8 nails. They could fix that. Other than that, I think it's a nice gun. DeWalt has always been good to me, and has yet to let me down."
3,Failed on second day of marginal use,"Screening in a porch and bought this to build new pillars and such. I probably drove less than 50 nails when a seal blew out.... Lowes was good enough to swap it out. I'll update if it makes it past the next 50 nails.Most of my tools are Dewalt, so I'm biased toward Dewalt. I wish this was more inline with their other product."
3,Poor packaging,"This product is fantastic at first vhowever, the more you use, not so much. Every time you open bottle, the ingredients get exposed and make them less effective. Wield be a great product if packaged in a airtight container"
3,Blaxice,"I very talented young man who in this age of pre-packaged, radio-formatted stars is faced with not knowing which demographic to target. Should he play up the smooth balladeer and be another face in the crowd, or try his hand as the loveable street-wise hustler hanging with his homeys and risk being the summer flava-of-the month? Although his ballads are definitely a strenght, especially ""Beautiful You"", his squeaky clean image makes ""The Way We Roll"" and ""OOOH WHEE"" almost comical.Not knowing which way to turn Braxton tries to hit all corners of the musical map, missing more times than hitting. This shotgun approach makes this effort sound like he won a talent contest and got a chance to cut a demo as the grand prize. Maybe he should have turned to his cousin,Toni (yes THAT Toni Braxton) for help."
5,Great for SD Cards (half the size of the label),"I bought this for labeling a collection of SD Cards, so I can keep all my videos and archives organized. The ACTUAL size of an SD card label is 1""; by 0.75"". This covers half of that, but it still works. Also it is small enough to label keys and other things that size. I'd imagine you could use these for pill containers or prices for yard sales, or any number of things.This size is better for SD Cards:http://www.amazon.com/Avery-Self-Adhesive-Removable-Labels-05428/dp/B00007M5GV/ref=pd_sbs_op_6"
1,wont hold up,"I thought MK was a trusted name in the tile industry...but this bit did not last. I used it wet and had good results drilling a few holes and that's it. Should really last longer, drilled less that 10 holes before becoming trash."
3,"Future Farce, but not as bad as some might think! If not taken seriously... (pls. read on)","Not as bad as the REALLY low budget andprofane sequel, Future Zone, which, sorryto say, sucks! Robert Tessier is great inhere (and surprisingly in Matuszak's OneMan Force as well) and the lovely DawnWildsmith is a fox! She's also very goodw/ Dave in Armed Response and especiallyin Warlords! Martial Law is better though.For the price for VHS copies of this now,it's well worth it! Pick Up On It! - R.A.S"
2,More fiction than fact,This book was disappointing due to the lack of using factual names and places. The very short book dealt with one battle and had the most emphasis on the main character's relationship with a female news coorspondant.
2,wrong size,"Dummy over here impulsively bought it for his .17hmr only to realize its designed for a .17 centerfire.The product is perfect, just not for me."
2,A regrettably 'Lite' treatment of an important issue,"When I checked this out of my library, I was looking forward to an insightful read of a really critical topic for our time. What I found instead was a very fluffy book, long on statements, short on facts and real insights. Taking a good look at the references shows one of the problems - many of the references are from newspapers and magazines, not journals or analytical works. I can almost imagine the author sorting out a shoebox of clippings while outlining the chapters.If you want something with some real substance to it, you'll have to look elsewhere. I don't think it's an accident that the author's picture doesn't appear on the book jacket."
3,tire a part,an other book by the same author----tire a part--also a film with terrence stamp-has a better plotthe end of a masterpiece of revenge is not a masterpiecealbert
2,wrong product description!,"the kit as described ......""This kit includes a sturdy plastic Z-Clip, refillable personal fuel canister, a 6-flint dispenser, and a 4 oz. can of Zippo Premium Lighter Fluid. The personal fuel canister will hold enough fuel for a fill up on the go, and the Z-Clip attaches to a belt, bag, or car visor to carry lighter securely. Add any full size lighter for a deluxe presentation.""!!!!THIS KIT ONLY INCLUDES 4oz LIGHTER FLUID AND FLINTS!!!!the fluid and flints are of course fine...but the product description is not correct."
1,USED,I was very disapointed when I opened this item. It looked really used and its not even silver anymore. The inside of the case was full of dust. This is not a NEW item.
3,Interesting snapshot of Depression era rural America,"Predictable and a bit formulaic, a little slow to get into but a read that doesn't make your brain wrinkle up. At times the action flow is a little discontinuous and some story line elements require a leap of faith for moving ahead."
2,Too Simple,"The story was too basic and predictable. It was hard to get into, I found myself skimming rather than being able to get into it in depth...."
2,not my type,After starting the story and struggling through the first part of this book I lost interest in it and decided that its not for me. Thats not saying it wont be good for ohers.
2,Simplistic Soap Opera,"One man's ""saga"" is another person's ""soap opera"". for me, this was a soap opera. Worse, it was a simplistic one. The ""tension"" was never taut and every problem was faced with a prayer. At times, especially the end, it seemed to be a book most fitting for Sunday School.The plot is a basic love story in a coal town. Smith is a former miner, drinker and brawler. Of course, he really has a heart of gold, which is brought out by the beautiful young widow who comes from a family of gold. This is a Harlequin without the label.There is a good mine rescue sequence that, unfortunately is offset by a horrendous courtroom scene. Television courtrooms are more realistic.There are a lot of family sagas out there - try any of them before this one. HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY is a better one also set in coal town."
3,Not bad,Cute story about what it was like back in the coal mining days. Liked the hero and heroine of story
4,Turn Back Time,"What a delightful historical Christian fiction romance story. The depression era, dangers in the coal mines, life in the hills of Kentucky were all dealt with in a way that pulled you into the story and kept your attention all the way through."
5,the 80s music,"the music on the cd really took me back to the ""big hair days it was a fun time the music and the styles back then and thats my favorite time anyway ! that was a time when the music was worth listening to and you can understand the words ! I remember seeing the video on mtv way back! I often wish that the radio stations would play more of the music from the 80s and maybe even the early 70s. the cd was very good I would recomend anyone who is really into the 80s music to buy this cd and it will certainly take you back to a fun time!"
2,Not for me,I'm a new AutoCAD user. This was one of two books I purchased.This wasn't a good to use to get started learning AutoCAD but may come of use in the future.
4,CAD 06 QR,This book was deeply informative and easy to use. I can find any command just by knowing my ABC's.
5,Masterpiece!,"What a beautiful-looking hockey jersey with one of the world's wonders of the world(Statue of Liberty) on the chest.The only small thing to nit-pick: Because the logo is so well-detailed, it can turn into a lint-magnet around the edges and because the jersey is dark blue, it can be visible up-close. Take care of your jersey and may be even buy a lint brush."
2,Darker than anticipated,"Bought for, and watched with, my ""I love all things Irish"" girlfriend. We both concluded the picture was fairly dark, amusing at times, and utimately unsatisfying as the director manipulates the viewer with the surprise ending. The interconnected storyline was very contrived, good guys (Colin Meaney) as nasty as the bad (Colin Farrell.) If its clever enough one can watch a movie mostly about losers but this film simply wasn't that clever."
4,Packable tool kit for your Vrod,I ordered this after a friend turned up with a kit for his Beemer that I liked and thought a smart idea. The tool kit is specific to a VRod in having metric and english tools. All tools appear to be of reasonable quality and should last for their intended use as a backup set (this is not a mechanics grade kit but the tools are quaranteed for life and better then the normal cheap quality tools out there). These tools are smaller then full size but just right for packing. I am adding a Leatherman to round out this kit but it seems otherwise complete and at ~$50 it beats pulling tools out of my regular tool box to take with me.I haven't had a chance to use them yet and hope to keep it that way but a must have for longer trips.My Two Cents!-Scott
4,Great scanner,Wonderful scanner - I like being able to save space by having it lean vertically. My only quip is that I wish the powercord came out of the back of the scanner rather than the front - it makes standing it up a bit awkward since you still need to lie it flat when scanning thicker objects. Very fast startup with little/no warmup time.
3,"Good scanner, lousy software","Canon has never released a Universal/Intel binary of their Mac OS X driver. The UI is cheap. If they fixed the software, this would be a great product."
1,Only trouble.,"Got this scanner lured by slim design and good price. I bought it over year ago - well it didn't work on my previous laptop - usb did not provide enough power to make it work.Then I got new computer - this time power is o.k, but drivers from provided software was defective, so it took me a lot of work to find online working one.So then finally I did try to scan and guess what - I can not scan anything as it fail to calibrate itself every time.It is piece of junk! I waisted my money ( as I kept it too long to be returned in hope it will work on newest laptop) and time.Look for something else, forget Canon."
2,A Lemon of A Scanner,"A fast, powerful OCR scanner is what I had hoped for, but instead got a slow scanner with presumed OCR technology that doesn't work well. Furthermore, the scanner software that comes with the scanner is terrible, and has a poor working interface. I do not recommend this scanner. Look elsewhere.Update: Finally had to sell the scanner because proper drivers were not made for it. While the company does have them for Mac OS 10.5, they didn't work properly."
2,Not for your film negatives!,If you are planning to scan film strips (it does not even work with mounted slides) this is certanly NOT the scanner. It crops the image and you will expend the rest of your life moving the back light one frame per scan.
5,"Amazing scanner, compact but powerfull","Excelent product, quick, simple use, and with years of use granted.If you are looking for a complete scanner, this is your best choice.You will not regret."
1,Warning!!!,Twice on the web page for this item it states that you CAN backup 'slides'. You CANNOT!!! It only does flat 'film' strips/negatives.We will be regretably returning this.
2,This was a bit of a let down,"Scans photographs OK, but there are blurry areas on other images, around the edges. I've been using scanners for many years, was tempted by the slim design...just didn't work out."
5,Canon scanner is amazing,"My objective is to scan in my most precious photos over the past 50 years (and much older photos from my parents) that I have in hard copy and negatives for backup and to use in memoirs. If you place the photos on the scanner with separations between them, each one is scanned as an individual .jpg file and the quality is incredible when I reprint them. I have not tried all the features, but am looking forward to scanning negatives as well. Great product, and so easy to install and use."
2,Not what I expected,"You get what you pay for. Flimsy and rubbery plastic. Deforms easily, Does not ride high enough for my tastes."
5,Great Range Holster,"Got this holster in the other day for my Gen 4 Glock 19. Brought it out to the range last night and it works great. Its a little tight right now, my friend that has one said it will loosen up some with time and still have good retention. Great deal for the money and worth getting if you want something to use at the range."
2,Review of Glock 30 holster,I returned this item because it will not fit a Glock Model 30 as advertised. Too small for the Glock frame.
1,Very Disappointed !,"Before I bought this, so called, holster, all the reviews were positive except one. Well the one negative reviewer was correct in his evaluation. Plenty of Re-tension... but the weapon can not be drawn without two hands. Also, there is no way to break-in this holster. Take your $15.00 and apply it to a better holster... don't make the same mistake that I made."
4,Great holster for the price.,"Good little holster. I use it for both my G26 and G19. Very tight to the body. Cant is a little more vertical than most holsters. (not tilted butt-forward as much as other holsters I've used) My only complaint is that retention is a little on the tight side. Takes a pretty good pull to unholster. Hard to beat for the price, though. Haven't worn my leather Galco holster since getting this one."
4,"Very, very pleased. Fantastic holster.","This holster works very well for OWB carry. It has good retention and keeps your Glock ""tight"" against your hip. The design completely covers and protects the trigger housing. I almost always use a hybrid IWB holster for concealed carry, but when the conditions and circumstances allow, this is a perfect holster for carrying under a suit coat or jacket. While some may view this as a ""cheap"" holster due to its price, I do not. This is a high quality accessory for your Glock. I give it an enthusiastic recommendation."
2,Wouldn't stay tight on my toe and broke,"At first this toe ring seemed sturdy, but once I started wearing it, it kept loosening up. I had to keep squeezing it tight so it wouldn't fall off, and finally it just broke in half. I only got to wear it for less than two months. Would definitely not buy anything from this brand again."
3,Softboiled crime Texas style.,"Murder by Deception by D.R. Meredith opens with the discovery of a murdered corpse in a wheatfield on the outskirts of Amarillo, Texas. The remainder of the book concerns itself with putting together clues to identify ""whodunit"". Unfortunately, the overly contrived plot makes the book's credibility essentially zero.The limited appeal of Murder by Deception derives exclusively from the personalities of the four main investigators. Lawyer John Lloyd Branson and his adoring protege Lydia Fairchild. And homicide detective Ed Schroder and his reluctant assistant Sgt. Larry Jenner. The mystery itself offers little to spark reader interest.This is a novel of softboiled crime, often referred to as a ""cozy"". A very average read, possibly of interest to fans of the genre. Would not recommend going out of one's way to obtain a copy."
1,Two strikes and you are out,"I ordered the 10-pack. Got the 1-pack. Submitted a claim and was assured that a real 10-pack was on its way. Got yet another 1-pack. Submitted a yet another claim. This time Amazon said this probably ain't going to be fixed, so they reimbursed me. I really wanted the 10-pack."
5,Fantastic!,"This is a fascinating study, and should be read by all who want to see how globalization affects the home and the family."
5,Wish he'd publish another,"I've seen some of his other works posted on the web, and he needs to publish another book!A great collection showcasing his style, from intricate dollhouses suspended in nature, to cascades and showers of rainbow elements, to stony vines, this is a great book. Again, I've seen other pieces of his on the web which add a new dimention to his volume of work--so he hopefully will publish again!"
4,Bliss,"""Samba Blim"" was the follow up to A&Ms release of ""We and the Sea"" and it is really nice to see it out on CD.This is a more accesable and generally lighter set than its predecessor but that should not be considered a criticism. This is about as nice as Bossa Nova gets. Beautiful music with substance and a lot of heart.The reason I only gave this four stars is because my experience with ""Samba Blim"" is limited to the LP. One of the LPs virtues was the tasteful recording job done by Rudy Van Gelder. Occasionally high end re-mastering can result in overly bright CDs.Even so, the worse that could happen is that you will have to thottle back the treble a little bit. Highly recommended."
1,not worthy of Janet Dailey,"I have really enjoyed Janet Dailey's category romances, the romance build-up, the wonderful, strong heroes---but this book was a letdown. Brock Canfield comes across immediately as a sleaze, kissing and fondling our witless heroine, Stephanie, moments after meeting her, while his girlfriend is in the next room! He treats his girlfriend with contempt, which should give Stephanie a clue as to how he'd treat her eventually. Stephanie lets him know at once she'd do anything for him, and all this after just one day together. He paws Stephanie on the dance floor while his girlfriend is sitting in a booth right there. Yet Stephanie questions nothing. All she wants is Brock. It is incomprehensible why he is interested in her, other than as a challenge to get a virgin into bed. This book is not romantic at all. How can it be when it's not possible to have any respect for the hero or heroine?"
5,Information about book - not 'review',"Can her devoted love conque his fierce independence?? Brock Canfield is a fiery, self-willed man, determined to have his own way. Stephanie too is determiend - to have Brock. His staunch independence hurts her. He wants to travel, to move from one glamorous city to the next, and to have his woman waiting when he picks up the phone. She wants a settled home and a loving husband who does not disappear to distant lands whenever business calls. She loves him - but can she accept his terms??"
2,Substandard shaver!,"I previously owned two electric razors, a Braun Synchro and a Panasonic procurve (with the higher rpm motor-8000 series).I thought that any Panasonic would compare to the one I have right now (which is a great razor). Unfortunately, I was wrong.This razor is pretty rough on the skin. I always feel like I've rubbed my face with sandpaper after using it. I don't get this feeling with my Braun or my other Panasonic. I can only assume it is because the motor on this razor is not as fast as my previous Panasonic razor. I recommend instead buying the faster motor Panasonic, with speeds of 12,000 rpms or something close to that. This razor is a disappointment. Don't expect this to serve any purpose other than an occaisonal touch up shave in your car."
2,it's okay,"I guess my expectations were too high. I don't have much of a beard but my facial hair is very course. This doesn't come anywhere near a razor and, not that I expected it to equal a razor but there is no upside to the convenience."
2,No Worldwide voltage conversion,"The product description: Worldwide voltage conversion.But actually it has a 110v adapter only. If I knew it, I should't have bought it. Do you know how to complain it to Amazon?"
3,DISAPPOINTED PANASONIC LOYAL CUSTOMER,"The reviewed shaver is my fourth Panasonic in a row. I had always bought a better one than the previous, except in this case. In every aspect it has disappointed me:- Quite noisy- Shave is not as close unless you last much longer- Battery charge lasts much shorter- Low battery indicator does not work unless you switch off and turn on again, and you will only do this when you actually feel from noise and shave that battery is almost out!! Result: time-waste waiting for a little charge. Hideous!- Charger is bulky and heavy- Does not work with 220V- Poor ergonomical designI am seriously thinking on returning to Philips/Norelco or Remington, both of which I owned previously."
1,Do not use this filter on a Honda Ruckus/Metro,"It doesnt seal properly, use a K&N HA-0502. Its miss marketed by a lot of sellers as a suitable replacement."
1,Do not buy!,"If you are purchasing this for your mower, do NOT buy! This will cause damage to your carb and then you are out some real money. There is a reason the manufacturers use the blue foam to seal this to the carb. This one has a hard plastic around it that DOES NOT SEAL! Smaller particles will get into the carb and destroy it. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
1,A REALLY STUPID BOOK,just the whole thing about this Anna character and her own little ridiculous language got on my nerves -it is foolish and corny and stupid..The book moves so agonizingly slow!
1,This so didn't work for me.,"It ended up being more a romance than a mystery, and the mother's reaction was completely unbelievable. It was all a bit melodramatic and the only thing about which I cared was getting to the end of the book. I'd take a pass on this one."
1,Ugg. Crap,"Don't waste your time with this one. I found the premise of the book to be so laughable, it hurt when I realized I wasted my hard earned money. There is nothing deep or methodical about this story, in fact it seemed pieced together at the last minute. You can practically guess where the plot will take you, and ultimately disappointed when it does just what you expected. The motives of the main characters are confusing and often they will go to great lengths to achieve something for no other reason than it seems significant for the story. Pass on this one."
4,Whitefriars Glass,"A perfect reference for the collector with alot of colour photographs. The book tends to concentrate on the later range of glassware from Whitefriars, particularly during the Baxter era. This comes as no surprise since the book was written for the Manchester City Arts Gallery exhibition of Whitefriars glass and there was a great deal of collaboration between the books authors and the late Geoffrey Baxter. The book is quoted as a reference on alot of EBay auctions of Whitefriars glass."
3,POST IT NOTES,I THOUGHT THEY WERE BIGGER THEN WHAT I ORDERED BUT ITS OK EVERYONE NEEDS SOME LITTLE ONES FROM NOW AND THEN.....BUT FAST DELIVERY >.
1,Tiny,Remember to check the measurements when you buy something. I thought they were going to be regular size post its and they turned out t be the tiny ones. They were almost 6 bucks a piece that is why I didn't pay attention to the size. Cost way to much.
4,Good product,"This stickies definitely are helpful, in my case I was looking exactly for this size so I have not complains about that. The colors are very nice as well."
4,Easy everyday notes,"When I'm at work I like to use these post it notes since people always give me phone numbers and names to write down. They're just so convenient. I can place them anywhere that I'll easily remember thanks to the adhesive back edge. The new springs colors are nice too, and nice change from the standard boring old yellow notes I'm used to.My biggest issue with these though is the adhesive. They're always too weak, so I need a small piece of tape to attach it to my computer monitor, desk, etc. Another minor issue is the bend it creates when ripping a sheet off. The top sticky rim seems to bend upward due to the motion you use when pulling the note off.They're still handy, and I'll keep using them. I do recommend them!"
2,Should be called post-it minis,"I know this is my fault - I did not read the description closely enough - but these are really small Post-Its. When it said ""original cube"", I didn't bother to pay attention to the dimensions. But these are not the ""normal"" sized Post-Its. So, even though it is described clearly... If you want a regular cube of Post-Its - don't buy this."
1,Horrible Drill,"This is the worst drill I have ever owned, been Framing / Contracting for a very long time, 10+ years, and this is the worst drill ive ever seen.Works fine in SDS mode, but when you change the chuck to drill ""normal"" wood and holes, this drill just has no power. The changeable chuck slips constantly and cannot use medium to large bits, the drill stalls out and you hear the slipping sound. Been into local dewalt repair shop twice, and they cant do a thing with it.DO NOT BUY"
3,Similar to another book,"T he designs are conglomerates of pieces of other doilies and don't lay flat very well. I have used the correct size hook and cotton, but find two of them designed incorrectly."
4,Tiltall Tripod Review,"Far better than the cheap plastic tripods on the market. Does not have any instructions but was easy to figure out. Try out one in person before deciding (as I always suggest). It holds my XTI + Heavy len + Flash, and battery grip just fine.You have to be used to the twist mechanism for tightening and untightening the legs. All in all it is solid. For around 100 dollars you cannot beat it (you have to spend a lot more to get anything more solid).I love the ability to tilt without worrying that it will topple over. And you can take it onto a hill and still set it up with the vast adjustability in the legs."
3,dr.scholls,I always order the size 6.5 and it fits me but in this kind of shoes didn`t fit i don`t know why but still good :)
3,When glamour and practicality - Recommended,"...P>CHILD OF HER DREAMS presents an interesting hero and heroine who are total opposites, which thereby places them at cross-purposes. Geena's life after death experience adds an extraordinary element to the novel. While the subsequent tension between characters maintains the reader's interest, the momentum of the tale unfortunately peters out during the second half of the novel, allowing the ending to fall a bit flat. I found myself feeling a bit impatient that she settles for so little after proving her abilities. Nevertheless, I confess to admiring a heroine who swallows her pride to seek a GED while also working hard to overcome a potential eating disorder, which makes reading CHILD OF HER DREAMS a worthwhile read. CHILD OF HER DREAMS comes recommended."
4,Learning about Probate,The book seems to be very good and could have been very useful had I received it on time.
5,It fits perfectly in our old slide out drawer,This replacement wastebasket fits perfectly in our 11 year old slide out trash can drawer. We looked all over town for a replacement and couldn't find anything close to the right size. This one feels sturdy and we are happy with it.
5,Fits perfect,The plastic bins fit perfectly into space I have. It is a pull out garbage area with two bins. Nice and sturdy.
5,Super,This is just what I was looking for as Rubbermaid seems to have stopped manufacturing and selling the original unit I was using.
5,Replacement pull out garbage containers,My kitchen built-ins hold 2 containers that drop in through wood cutouts from above. The original baskets had no markings but they are identical to the 30 quart white baskets I got here. I haven't found these anywhere else.
5,replacement trash cans,"I have a slide out trashcan holder unit in my kitchen. It is 12+ years old and the trash cans had finally cracked and were falling apart. I had purchased many trashcans that I thought would fit but NOTHING worked, then one day I found this review stating that she had had her trashcan unit over 11 years and was also having nothing but trouble finding replacements. I AM SO EXCITED TO SAY THAT THESE FIT PERFECT AND LOOK JUST LIKE THE ONES I HAD.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006NNLBG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,Kitchen Waste Basket,Needed a replacement for an under-counter trash bin - this was the perfect size and works great. No issues and it seems fairly durable.
3,"Not a great fit, but cute.","This was an XL costume, but it wasn't big enough to fit my Akita - the ""shoes"" were inches above his actual feet. The material is thin and flimsy. However, it is super cute on!!"
5,Romantic beyond belief.,"An astonishing collection of classics from the Absolute master of mood music.This music is not for those with weak bladders,so romantic it will make you fall in love again and again.Highly recommended especially for the audiophile with state of the art audio systems and of course all lovers."
2,Disappointing Earl Klugh CD,"This was my second Earl Klugh CD purchase and I was hoping for some more beautiful acoustic guitar music. What a disappointment, however. All the songs sound the same, have the same tempo, and you can barely make out Earl's playing from all the other instruments, etc. Save your money."
2,WARNING!,"The most dramatic event of the entire work has been CUT from this version.I can only assume that since this was performed at the Vatican, officials there would not allow what happens in the work's most dramatic moment to take place, leaving the rest of the work confusing and less meaningful.With no mention of the cut accompanying the disc, this is an incomplete version and should be avoided."
3,Great production but DVD flawed,"I ordered this because our local symphony recently performed it, but the diction of most of the singers was bad and you couldn't understand a lot of it. The singers on this DVD were wonderful and you could understand pretty much every word. However, there was a flaw on this DVD, so I will need to return it for a replacement."
2,MASS in Japan,"There is a DVD avaiable from JAPAN of the entire performance albeit performed in Japan (I mean overseas in the country), but the orch and performers are very good, dif from the original for obvious reasons, I want to say it is HMV in Japan but I must check my records for this, I think you can also find it on the Bernstein site and the Kennedy site, I found this about a year or so ago, the original Kennedy performance is hung up in litigations between I think SONY, Kennedy and the family, although the family wants it released."
4,"Mass, Leonhard Bersntein","The original recording, that was conduced by Bersntein is bettter than this ."
1,Sub par,"I am a huge fan of Mass. I have been since 1972 or so. I saw the 1973 BBC/PBS broadcast of the European premiere which was incredible. I saw the 10th anniversary production broadcast live from the Kennedy Center on PBS. It was good, but not as good as the 1973 broadcast. This production doesn't compare. It is a concert production so there is very little staging. The soloists do a fine job with the singing, but for the most part, I have seen more believable acting at my local high school. The classical chorus in the background is small and weak. The climatic scene where the Celebrant hurls down the communion chalice and wafer and removes his vestments and dances on the alter has been emasculated. This is a poor production in most aspects.Give us the first two video productions on DVD instead of this poorly staged and acted concert production."
3,Very Disappointed in the Surround Sound,"I have followed the Mass from its beginning. I was fortunate to experience it at the JFK Center on opening night, the second opening attended by Lenny with the former First Lady and also at the Pope Paul VI auditorium. It is a masterpiece and timeless. The Surround Sound does not begin until the Credo. Am I the only one that has this problem or do I have a defective DVD.Does anyone know of another DVD of The Mass? I watch it weekly and Lenny has the insight to see the Catholic Church as it is.What an experience.Thanks ofr any help with questions I ask."
4,"Toned-Down Version, But Pleasing","Those who may have seen MASS live at the Kennedy Center,or who remember PBS's 1981 broadcast of that lavish production, will be in for a surprise with this production performed at the Paul VI Hall of Audiences at Vatican City. The set is minimal, there are no marching bands, no lavish banners, and yet this production of Leonard Bernstein's MASS is still quite a pleasure to watch and listen to. The singers are more than competent, and what the show lacks in scenery and props, it more than makes up for in ""heart."" This is a nice MASS."
3,Gilmour Duster,"Gilmour D1 1-Pound-Capacity Dry Application Garden DusterThis unit does dust but...1. The extension tube falls off easily, finally left it off.2. Controlling the amount of dust is hard. The pump puts out enough air, but the amount of dust depends on what angle you hold it and the amount of powder in the tank.3. Easy to use, refills easily."
2,Not so great!,Works better without the defuser attachment. Attachment causes chunky uneven spreading of powers. Worked much better after taking the long defuser off. Does help to conserve product.
1,Useless and worthless,"This duster sometimes dispenses a modest amount of dust, while at other times it will only shoot out a very tiny, tiny puff of powder. Constant shaking of the unit helps a little bit, but this Gilmour Garden Duster is much-to-much work to use, so I went back to using the Seven-5's canister itself; ten times easier!"
3,Usable,This will get your powder where you need it to go. Wish that the extension would stay on better. It will fall off as you are applying.
5,great product!!,A guick and easy way to spray a powder on your garden. I used it to spray DE for insect control on peppers and tomatoes. works like a charm.
1,Did I get a dud?,Not sure if my contraption is broken or what but it does not spray a fine mist of dust at all. When I first push the plunger a huge shot of powder blob comes out and the rest of the push i get nothing at all. The dust does fly everywhere but I expected that. I could create more of a fine dusting with my hands.
3,Simple and easy to use.,Good item for the price. Wand end falls off occassionally if not shoved on tight enough but not a real problem. Terrible squeak that I think I can correct by just a little oil on the shaft of the pump. It does the job for my small garden.
2,Not for DE,Do not use this product with diatomaceous earth (DE). It will grind the insides outand then the pump will not work. It is a good tool for other uses.
4,Performs as expected,"This product works pretty much as it is described, and is a good value for the price. I used it to spray sulphur powder on a nectarine tree, and it worked just fine - you do get a workout from pumping it though ! I did not give it 5 stars because, as someone else mentioned, it squeaks loudly when you pump it. That becomes annoying after a while. If that could be resolved, it would earn the 5th star."
1,Might as well send your money to me,"This thing is, to put it politely, excrement. Crappy threads on the reservoir get worn and gummed up after a few fillings of DE, it clogs, one pump it puts out barely enough powder to be usable and the next pump it dumps out great clots of powder. An abject waste of time, money and diatomaceous earth."
1,Useless,"This worked great for about 15 minutes, but then started spraying out the back of the unit. Don't waste your money on this!"
1,Attachment and 4 inch Tube inside keeps falling off,"Glad to hear many of you like this product but it does not work well for me. Attachment keeps falling off when I pump it and the inside attachment (the 4 inch tube) that connects to the applicator nozzle keeps falling off when I pump the duster so that huge clumps come flying out. I then have to open the top up, find the tube, and re-insert the tube back in the applicator and it will work a short time before falling off again and sending out huge clumps again. It would have been much better if this tube was SCREWED into the canister rather than PUSHED into it. Maybe like some of the others who posted here, I just received a bad one. Glad it is working well for others using it."
1,Why is this not available as an audiobook?,Is it not ridiculous and ironical that a book about the great man who invented the braille system is not available as an audiobook that can be appreciated and can be inspiring by blind people all over the world?
1,Old movie....it shows,"Nostalgia aside..God they actually made poor movies when compared to today.So, if you are into outdated technology, moviemaking and effects...watch this."
2,thumbs down,"It's a bit much asking us to buy a video for the orchestration and costumes. I didn't pay much attention to the costumes, but as it happens, I found the orchestration rather syrupy. (Newman tries hard to turn ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" into ""The Street Where You Leave"" and fails. The movie would be better off if he didn't try so hard.) In any case, a musical in which ""it's the music that counts"" is a musical in which the principals have voices and actually sing their songs. Lowe's work is slaughtered here. Some points of (possible) interest: Lancelot's songs are dubbed in (by someone other than Franco Nero); Guenevere's songs are not: Redgrave sings them--sort of. Arthur never calls Guenevere ""Ginny""; he calls her ""Jenny"". (Those who have read the book--""The Once and Future King""--know this. Those who have not read the book ought to.)"
4,There once was never a Camelot like this,"Joshua Logan dreadfully directed this film for full impact on the snooze-o-meter. The picture wavers in tone, but it does have skillful bits of genius tucked in among his labored directorial blunders. This is very uncharacteristic filmmaking from Logan. Richard Harris' King Arthur is terribly acted and unfathomable in the first half, but he achieves some effective moments later in the film. The movie is somewhat saved by a good performance by David Hemmings and the screen presence of Franco Nero. It's a film you really wanted to like but you are just not able to. It's a shame."
3,Flawed but enjoyable version,"This is a very well done version of the Arthurian legends, and despite the fact that it has bad choreograhy, DESPITE the fact Franco Nero's acting is sub Ed Wood, and DESPITE the fact it IS a little long, it STILL has quite a few good moments, and as a whole is a good film for the family."
5,What can I say,Best musical ever. Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave are fantastic. Amazon did a great job getting it to me promptly.
1,Love the film/Hate the packaging,"I had been waiting for the bluray release of this beautifully visualized interpretation of the classic stage musical from the first moment I began collecting a bluray library. I was very disappointed with the inflated pricing of this cardboard picture book packaging. Wait another month and get the same bluray disc for a fraction of the cost. This ""collectable"" release does nothing but take up twice the shelf space of a standard bluray case. Trust me. If you love a stylized romantic fairy tale, you will watch this fantasy again and again, but once you've realized the insignificance of the pointless book sleeve, you won't give it's content a second thought. Save your money and live the dream!"
2,"Slow, Weak","If you are among those enchanted by everything relating to the legends of King Arthur, you will no doubt enjoy this screen adaptation of the famous stage play. The rest, however, will find little enjoy in this rather slow and frequently pretentious film which consistently implies more than it ever delivers. A remarkable cast is largely wasted, the famous score is performed with the smallest modicum of acceptable skill, and the story itself moves at the pace of drug-addicted turtle."
4,Blu-ray Review: 'Camelot' 45th Anniversary Edition,"The ""Camelot"" 45th Anniversary Blu-ray is a must-own for musical enthusiasts and classic film fans. Its clean and striking picture partnered with a bombastic 5.1 surround mix is an experience you won't want to miss. The performances are stellar; the costumes are exceptionally detailed; and the sets are realistic and immense. The addition of the special features makes this a worthy addition to anyone's Blu-ray collection."
2,Great Musical - Bad Adaptation,"THE REASON I AM REVIEWING THIS IS BECAUSE IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY AMAZON TO ME AND IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT RECOMMENDED BUT HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM.I had listened to the Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Robert Goulet cast album and loved the score. I finally got a chance to see the film and it was unbearable.I would say that it is the cast - most have never been in a musical and never have done a musical again. But I saw Richard Harris do it on stage and he was brilliant.I have to put the blame on director Joshua Logan. Logan was one of the greats of Broadway and Hollywood but at times he got caught up in the luxury of the movie (look at South Pacific). And this film is overly luxuriant.If you are a fan of the show then try and find the Showtime production of the Richard Harris stage production. This was a beautiful filming of a stage show."
3,a somewhat disappointing,In most of the beginning of this reproduction the lip sinc was off. This was a disappoinment because it took away from the songs and speaking.
3,Camelot,"O.K. for a special edition, nothing extra. was expecting a little more hooray. Have seen Camelot many times and enjoy most of them"
5,One of my favorite movies,"Love the movie, love the music, love the story. I'm glad it was issued in Blu-ray, so I can see it again in all it's glory."
5,Great movie!,I have seen this movie in every decade of my life. My opinion of the characters varies accordingly but my opinion of the movie never varies - I love it!
2,It was just Okay,"At first viewing this movie is alright. My bit of advice would be make sure you never listen to the broadway cast recording of Camelot if you want to like this movie. Julie Andrews voice is so superior to Redgrave's it is not even funny. Julie should have been the Queen. At least they asked her to be. I loved the way she declined and since she wouldn't perform this show fell through. I hated the way the director says that there was no one else better than Vanessa for the Queen. He must have been in denial that Julie said ""No."" Julie clearly would have been the better choice. I also think the storyline is slightly terrible. I have always had mixed feelings about the King Arthur legends. I hate how the Queen falls for Lancelot, he is the most self-absorbed snot that ever lived. THe singing isn't wonderful and I would highly recommend the broadway casts version to the movie. Julie is the greatist and no one can ever live up to her."
1,Camelot special edition,"I ordered this item on october 10th. Finally received it december 15th, but cannot play it because it can be played only in North America, wheras I live in The Netherlands, Europe.The website gives possibilities for returning only, but not about complaints. I am very disappointed about Amazon's services."
1,AWFUL!!!!,"Awful, awful, awful. Overacting run amok in a silly, unnecessary movie. The worst part was that it looked like a lot of effort went into this film and how horrible was the effort. What a waste of time. AWFUL."
1,DO NOT BUY CAMELOT DVD FROM DVD LEGACY,"I ordered Camelot (special edition) from DVD Legacy on November 24, 2008. My credit card was charged on November 25, 2008. It is now December 30,2008 and I have not received the DVD. I've sent several e-mails and all I get is ""it's been shipped"". This experience ruined my Christmas. The DVD was a grab bag gift for my office party. It was most embarrassing to show up without the requested gift. I am so disgusted with Amazon and DVD Legacy."
3,Blu-ray Quality Good - Not Great,"The quality of this new blu-ray transfer of ""Camelot"" is good, but not great. It's perhaps the old grainy film stock that was used back in the 60's, but it didn't translate to blu-ray as well as I had hoped. It certainly is tons better than the ""My Fair Lady"" fiasco by CBS (which could have been stunning had they used the 70mm restored print master). The dark scenes are the worst, but the other, lighter scenes, look very good. Wish it could have been digitally restored and they had cleaned up some of the annoying artifacts that show up so noticeably on blu-ray. Still, if you like this movie, you will be happy to have this ""new"" blu-ray release in your collection. The program book included in this release is great. The soundtrack is a plus, too. It looks and sounds far better than the DVD."
5,The most wonderful rendition of King Arthur ever!,"I absolutely fell in love with this movie from the very first song! Guenivere (Redgrave) is very convincing, as are Aurthur (Harris) and Lancelot. Harris is amazing as Authur. One feels all of his pain, his hopes, his confusion. King Pellinore, Aurthers good friend, is a welcome comady relief. My favorite line? ""How can you get a fair decision from people so impartial?"" from Pellinore. The songs are generally very lively, although there are a few beautiful love songs. The costumes and scenery were amazing! (Keep an eye out for the guys with lots of dark eyeshadow, and remember, everyone in the movie has blue eyes.) The first time I saw this movie it climbed the list to one of my favorites. Camelot is a true classic, a must-have for broadway lovers, a must-see for anyone who has ever dreamed an impossible dream!"
5,great old movie,I have liked this movie for years. I really like the setting and the costumes. filmed with all the seasons of the year
2,Camelot (Region 2),Notice the Region 2. I didnt. Now I realize that the DVD will not play in standard players in the United States.Be smarter than I was.
3,MISSING LINES,"ALTHOUGH I LOVE THIS MOVIE, I WAS VERY IRRITATED AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THE DIALOGUE WAS MISSING...ONLY THE MUSIC WAS THERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS WENT ON. I PUT IN THE VIDEO INSTEAD."
2,Legendary Musical Falls Flat,"This is a magnificent musical. It SHOULD HAVE been made with Julie Andrews, Richard Harris and Robert Goulet. Vanessa Redgrave looks wonderful, but her character seems depressed most of the time and the woman can't sing a note to save her life. Franco Nero was handsome, but looks Italian, not English... fortunately they found a very English voice to dub his songs. The other problem with this film, which bothered me when I first saw it was that it has the most cardboard looking stage sets for some scenes I have ever seen, and worse, the cameras move about exposing the painted backdrops even more. I do believe in the late 60s when this movie came out they had cameras that could be transported to real locations. My hope is that this beautiful musical will eventually be re-made with a SINGING cast using real outdoor locations.... please!!"
2,What a Disappointment!,"I recently picked up a VHS copy of this at a local thrift store for almost nothing. Having never seen it, I was looking forward to an exciting 3-hour musical. What a disappointment! Virtually the entire film lacked consistency and cohesiveness. Though some of the musical numbers were quite good, the acting on the part of Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave was unimpressive. Overall, the film was very labored and there was little to connect one scene to another. If you want a truly excellent rendition of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, get a copy of the 1997 film, First Knight starring Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond. The acting is first rate and the film is filled with action and does not drag along like Camelot does. Overall, I was not at all impressed by this film, especially when comparing it to the musicals of Rodgers & Hammerstein or My Fair Lady."
5,No Title,"Come on Amazon, give us a break. If you make it so difficult to review each item purchased I do not know why I should bother. Suffice to say that 'Camelot' is one of my favourite musicals and I therefore enjoy watching it. What more can I say?"
5,fabulous,I had forgotten this classic. It is worth the watch. It is another version of the legend. The music is great.
4,Camelot many years later,"I saw this movie in the theatre in the late 1960's. I also saw Richard Harris perform it on stage in the 1980's, I think. The story is one of my favorites - the idealism of King Arthur, the land of nobility, the eternal triangle of Arthur, Guenevere, and Lancelot, and the music of Lerner and Loewe. I was pleased with the look and the sound of this video. The picture is bright, the colors are good. Certainly, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a positive spin on the story of King Arthur and the Round Table."
3,OK,"Franco Nero's performance is a bit on the stilted side, but Redgrave and Harris give fine performances in this fine musical"
5,All-time favorite,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! Between the wonderful actors, the story line, the music (especially), this is an wonderful classic....none better!!"
3,Remberance,"I first saw this movie years ago when it was in the theaters. It was at a sad time in my life and watching it now brought back lots of memories I would like to forget. I think the movie is too long and has too much singing or music, but of course it was a broadway musical. I did enjoy seeing the young Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave."
2,BAD PACKAGING,"The case in which the DVD is enclosed was falling apart when delevered. VERY cheap packaging! Not at all ""collectors"" quality. I will need to purchase a new case and try to put the printed paper into a new case, thus ruining any potential ""collector"" status."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!,"This item is defective!!!!!! ................ I see other reviews that say the same thing. There is no dialog sound!!! ... You hear only the music. There are no voices!!!DEFECTIVE!!! DEFECTIVE!!!!!VERY, VERY, VERY UNHAPPY !!!!!!!!"
5,Perfect gift!,"I bought this for my Aunt for her birthday last month, and she absolutely adores it! She watches it at least once a week :)"
5,Movie lover!,"Camelot (Special Edition).....Well what can I say, I loved it, The music was beautiful. The only draw back was I wish it was in full screen. But I thought it was done beautifully."
5,a must have,"The story of King Arthur has been told so many, many times but, none so well as in this version on Camelot. Truly a classic for all ages."
3,Unbelievable Customer Service,"Had a problem with the first computer sent out, co. bent over backwards to take care of us. Returned and shipped twice at no cost to me. Very unexpected in today's times."
2,describe like new,"I received a laptop that was described as like new, the laptop was physically dirty, had many scratches on the screen and body, and came with a dead battery. The decscription and technichal details said that it came with 512 RAM and a dvd drive but came with 256 RAM and a CD drive. when i wrote to him about it, he told me that i should have read his comments to find those details. He should have written the correct details in the description in the first place."
1,Wrong product received and completely dissastified,"I receive a Dell Latitude D600 instead of the Dell Latitude C640. Majority of the times it will not boot up - it just start the booting process and stop. Due to this problem, I have to reformat the hard drive with Windows XP but the problem continues. I would say this Dell Latitude D600 that I receive is a junk. My first Laptop that I purchase from Amazon is still working excellent, I am using it to send this review. I also purchase two more laptop from Amazon, after the first purchase and they are working excellent. However this last purchase is a disaster."
2,Ehhhh......,"This product started working really well, but then... JUST RUINED MY SKIN! I felt like it was a waste because it only made a difference for the first week and then.. nothing. I don't know how each indicidal will feel when they try this but personally I did not think it was that effective."
5,Excellent BBQ,This unit was a pleasure to build. The BBQ is made extremely well and I'm sure it will last for years. Cooks very evenly...no hot spots that I have found yet.
3,a little disappointed,"i purchased the grill and it took the full time indicated plus a day or two to receive. The grill has 2 problems as I see it. When the 3 burners are wide open the grill does not get over 550. My old 2 burner got to 600 easily. The other problem is I bought a smoker box and when put on the hottest part of the grill, it didn't get hot enough to produce smoke. Not happy so far."
3,A reasonable substitute,"This Telephoto Mirror Lens is light and handy, affordable and easy to carry. It fits my Olympus 420 well. I can make the shootings by using Manual or Aperture Prioity modes for exposure and Manual mode for focusing. One disadvantage of this lens is it is difficult to get sharp pictures, even for still objects. The F/8 is preset so the depth of field is very narrow. Besides, mirror lens may not be as sharp as regular lens. In short, it is good if you only need to take 500MM pictures once a while. It is not a good alternatives for those who always take pictures with long telephoto lens, not to say for professionals."
5,Awesome!,"I heard of this lens from a friend of mine who said they work great, but it can take time. I have been working with this lens for a little while now and I absolutely love it! It's awesome! It takes a little while to figure out (a few days, tops) but once you get it, you will be amazed at what can be done with it! I can snap a photo 10 feet from me or a block down the road! The attachment they send with it worked perfectly. It was not loose or ill fitting. Working with flashes and different settings in your camera really helps! I would definitely recommend this to anyone! I have the Olympus E-420 and it worked fine with mine!"
3,Olympus Lens,"I purchased this item for my camera, but when I received it it didnt work very well with my system. It may have just been a fluke, but I returned it and the return process was easy. Its a great deal if it works with your system."
5,Just as advertised!,I wanted to label my SpiceStack and new spice jars but I didn't want those gummy labels that are impossible to remove. So I searched and found these. They are perfect. I quickly downloaded the template from avery.com and started to work. They are self-adhesive and remove easily. This package will last me a very long time. I have found other things around the house that I can quickly put a quick label on. I think these would be great to label travel bottles.
3,Dry but academically appropriate,"I read this book as to get a simple foundation/understanding of the U.S. Supreme Court and their historical trends covering the major issues talked about in society today. It is dry, typical book you would read before or during law school but would not recommend it for someone not interested in pursuing law."
2,Broad overview with no strong thesis,"Tushnet knows his subject, The Supreme Court, extremely well. No doubt about that. I did not like the way the book was put together and found it hard to follow what Tushnet's ideas were that he was trying to get across. Although he's very knowledgeable , I don't think this is a book that adds a lot of value or knowledge to the subject: specifically the Renquist Court. I think many other books on the court and individual essays on it's members would be better and more easily accessible to the layman."
5,Easy to make and fun craft for kids,"This is such a cute craft to do with little girls or older girls cause its fun. Takes no heating beyond hot tap water, which melts the lip gloss then you can portion it out, add flavor and color and put into cute little containers which you then have stickers to decorate. A fun, fast and easy play time. And surprise, the lip gloss is really really good.!!"
3,Needs more lip balm flavor!,"My daughter recieved this as a gift. It didn't come with the stickers which was dissapointing. The lip balm is a bit messy, as I expected. It would be a lot better if there was more flavoring. Also it says to divide the wax into 5 equal parts. The pots are sooooo tiny not even 1/5th of the wax fits in there. That was a mess until I figured out that it was way to much."
3,lip balm,"It is messy because of the petroleum jelly. The flavors were not the best or more flavorful. I had to take the tops off the bottles because they wouldn't drip out and stick tooth picks inside them to pull the flavors out (amost like if they were dried up). Overall, she enjoyed making them."
1,Very Messy Product,"My daughter is 10 has wanted this product for a long time and I finally got it for her for Christmas, but we were both disappointed in how messy it was! For her birthday this past year we made lip gloss out of vaseline and food flavorings and that way was a lot cheaper and less messy. The ingredients they use in the base balm are very hard to get off of everything, including the kitchen sink! I wouldn't recommend. Sorry!"
2,Ooey Gooey Headache,"Yes, ditto with the other reviewer who describes the vaseline consistency. My daughter does not want to apply it to her lips, as she says it is greasy and yucky. (And she LOVES lip balm.) While making it, the stuff would not wash off my or my daughter's hands. So, we ended up just rubbing it into our skin. I know, gross. The squeeze out flavoring does not squeeze out of the pinhole-sized nozzle opening, as it is thick syrup. I had to pry off the nozzle and use a chopstick to draw it out. My daughter loved doing that with the chopstick and then mixing up the colors/flavors and later decorating the containers with stickers. So because she enjoyed a few steps in the process, I give it 2 stars instead of 1. But, it was REALLY messy and a challenge for adults, not to mention kids."
2,Better Option!,I was going to purchase this for my Daughters Spa Theme Birthday. (She is 7) Thankfully we read some of the reviews and after talking to some people that used similar kits I decided against buying it.I did however have to think quickly and get some lip balm and I found the website bulkapothecary.com (spelling may be wrong? ) They sold already filled and flavored (unlabeled) lip balm in any flavor for .21 I just got address labels from staples and had the girls create their own label with markers. They loved it! And the lip balm was wonderful! Hope this helps!!
1,Caused Allergic Reactions!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS ALLERGIC REACTIONSMy granddaughter received this as a 9 th birthday gift. She made one for her me , after having it on for a few minutes my lips started to itch and burn so I removed it. Her aunt had tried some of the gloss and her lips went numb. I have never had any previous reaction with any kind of makeup, but It makes me seriously cautious about buying this for children . My granddaughter will NOT be using this kit. Too bad it was a neat concept."
1,JUNK,"messy, flavorless and not particularly fun. the containers get so gooey that my daughter couldn't even decorate them. I would not recommend it."
1,"Fun kit, but smells horrible!","My daughter was so excited to play with this kit, and really enjoyed setting up and mixing everything. Unfortunately, the lip balm base smells and tastes exactly like motor oil - and no amount of flavoring could cover it up. Her plan was to make lip balm for each of her friends, but the kit got thrown in the trash after the first experiment. Disappointing result for an expensive product."
1,Terrible,"Trying to make the lip gloss was a terrible experience! The wax used to make the gloss is disgusting. It takes forever to get if off skin or anything else you get it on. Sadly, the whole present ended up in the trash."
1,Poorly designed product,"My daughter is a crafter, so we have completed an endless amount of kits . This one was the most disappointing by far. Really not much of a project to begin with. The outcome is a sticky unpleasent mess. My daughter who is pretty easy going and loves lip gloss, wanted no part of this finished product. Also as a kicker the little bag to store the glosses in is too small. It took a lot of effort on my part to get them in bag. No fun for her at all."
3,science for girls,I bought this for my 6 year old. She liked it at first but Mom did most of the work. Better for older girls if you want them to be able to create their own gloss. Colors are weak.
2,Way too messy for the end result!,"This project is a big mess! It was fun at first for my daughter to stick the stickers on the containers, dump colors into the Vaseline-like goo, and make a gooey mess. Then, her hands got too greasy to operate correctly and it became annoying. The end result is stinky and barely colorful goo that's too hard to actually contain in the greasy tiny containers. The process was messy and annoying for both of us and we're throwing away the finished lip balm."
4,Mema's Observations,"I think it's a brilliant idea. I have a granddaughter who is very much into protecting her lips with balm. She's also bright and creative. She made lip balm for all of us at xmas and then put the box away...I think permanently. Perhaps she's a little too old for this or perhaps she's bored easily, but at that price it was great fun."
2,Not as much fun as I thought,"I bought this for my granddaughter (who is 10) as an activity we could do together. I usually like Creativity for Kids products, but this is not their best idea. Making the lip balm does not take much time nor any real skill. When finished, the lip balm was pretty unattractive. When you are looking for some creativity for your kids, keep looking."
1,messy disappointment,"I bought this kit for my daughter and her friends to use at her birthday party. What a mess it was. There were 5 girls, and the last 2 to take a turn with it didn't even bother with it. Not nearly as fun and neat as we thought it would be. A definite waste of money."
2,"Fun, but messy","Fun idea and not too hard to do, but end product doesn't work very well and the whole thing is pretty sticky/messy.Did this for my daughters 8th birthday party and would NOT recommend it"
1,Ew,"I wish I had read the reviews. This product was difficult to use - you could hardly scrape the goo into the tiny measuring cup. And using warm water to ""melt"" the mess? All that happened was we swirled it around until the colors mixed and managed to smear most of it into the container. It didn't harden after that so it was like putting glue on your lips. So Gross. Clean up was a disaster. My tip - use paper towels instead of soap and water. I hope I didn't clog my drain.The containers and stickers are cute but the bag was too small for all five. We will keep them and make our own lip balm from beeswax and coconut oil instead of the junk used in this kit."
1,Horrible Lip Balm Product,"This is the worst product! It was a disaster to clean up and not so easy to mix either. Directions say to clean with soap and water....Not even Dawn Detergent will break up this mess. We had to use Go-Jo Grease Cleaner to scrub things down including us to break up the palmate product that is used! On another note, my daughter decided to put some of this in her hair one day...Lord knows why! We tried clarifying shampoo, Dawn Detergent, Corn Starch being rubbed in then brushed out then shampooed again, a gentle hair stripper from our hair stylist and nothing would take this mess out of her hair! I called the company directly and they said ""oh just use soap and water"". Yeah that doesn't work! I explained everything to them and the advice they gave was useless. I called my brother in law the chemist in the family who reminded me to use the Go-Jo or a Green based chemical cleaner lightly on her hair and that finally worked. Good luck if you get this product!"
1,Not all it claims,"This gun claims to have low recoil-totally false! My husband bought this gun for me because of the low weight and recoil advertisement, and well after using it for 2 days I could not bend my wrist or grab anything. This gun needs so much force to use the trigger and the recoil is so severe it is unusable. My husband also used it for a day and agreed, and after being in construction for 8 yrs he could not stand it. He has used Porter Cable and Paslode and would never recommend a Dewalt to anyone. In fact he bought me a Paslode today to replace the Dewalt. Horrible gun and be prepared to miss work days due to wrist pain!"
1,If only the nails went all the way in,"Although it seems lighter than any other framer I've used for some reason I can't get the gun to shoot the naile all the way through the wood. There always seems to be a 1/4"" to an 1"" of the nail hanging out. I'm a big DeWalt Fan, any tool I can buy from them I do. I wish I went with the standard Bostich or even and enemy... Porter Cable!"
5,FABULOUS food!,"I started feeding my cat Sammy Snacks a couple months ago, and since then he has had more energy, has an INCREDIBLY soft coat, sheds less, and his poo doesn't smell as bad as with the old food! He wakes me up every morning so he can have his Sammy Snacks for breakfast. We love it!"
3,Mixed feelings on Terminal City,"Though ""Terminal City"" is described as ""imaginative and fun"" on the back of the box by Entertainment Weekly. I have mixed feelings. (BTW, I don't know why Entertainment Weekly would find a woman scared out of her mind and dying of breast cancer imaginative and fun).The concept was good and the acting excellent. It is just that some of the scenes just didn't feel right.At the beginning of the series, our lead actress is at a golf course, wearing a ludicrous outfit of a skirt and gloves. The outfit alone was bad enough but then she hits golf balls into other peoples homes (breaking windows) because of her diagnosis.In another scene she is driving up the road and showing her breast to her daughter as she drives. Just unrealistic.However, as mentioned the concept of a reality series built around her illness is good. And it kept my attention.Not as good as Weeds or Six Feet Under but still an interesting show."
1,THIS IS NOT FLEUR DE SEL BUT COARSE GRAY SALT!,"I searched Amazon for Le Paludier Fleur de Sel, and this item appeared as if it was the Fleur de Sel in a larger quantity. It was not Fleur de Sel at all. This is grey salt. Further, the salt wasn't even fine grind; it was coarse grind.Worse than the item itself was the terribly slow shipping speed. I ordered the item November 15, well in time for Thanksgiving. The item did not even arrive until the day following Thanksgiving.This order has been a complete and thorough disappointment."
4,A unique Star Wars figure,"I love the idea behind this. It's so seldom that we see anything regarding Ralph McQuarrie's concept art for the original Star Wars. These figures are a great representation of what might have been. However, I'm not so crazy about Boba - he's essentially a white Boba Fett, which isn't as interesting as the final green armor he wears in the movies.The figure itself is highly posable and has great detail."
2,KIND OF A SNORE FOR SUCH AN INTERESTING TOPIC,I was really looking forward to this look at one of the leading figures in Negro League history. But the writing is exceedingly dull - the author seems to have read a lot of Frank Deford and believed he was a legitimate writer. The book just turns into yet another sports-bio celebration. Yawn!
5,"Great, uplifting read.","I really enjoyed this book. Buck O'Neil's warmth comes right through. It's full of humorous anecdotes about various players in the Negro leagues, and while Buck makes no claim that the players didn't suffer discrimination, he has plenty of wonderful stories of staying and playing in black-run establishments, many of whom didn't survive integration of society.It's a very interesting look back at a league that truly was part of America, the (as Ken Burns put it) shadow America. Highly recommended."
2,"Nott lost the plot...Simply ""Memoirs"".","Although Nott's first book was interesting from the point of view of glimpses of Gurdjieff in action, this book is mainly his life memoirs and has little to do with Gurdjieff. He does a lot of name dropping but doesn't really say anything. He also criticizes Ouspensky again and again which becomes quite tedious: Gurdjieff actually had to interupt Nott when he was on another ""negative Ouspensky spree"". Strange for a man who blows his own trumpet frequently about his time and ""success"" with Gurdjieff.I was dissapointed with this book mainly because of the authors' negative view of the much greater Ouspensky, and also to see how much he had lost the plot over the years - he wrote this book in 1968, nearly 20 years after Gurdjieff's death.There are a couple of interesting memories but the whole book could be narrowed down to a few pages for them."
5,Marvelous Fan,"I've owned a number of fans. This is by far the most versatile. It can be pointed straight up to give the effect of a ceiling fan, a position I often use during sleep to provide a little air movement and white noise. Or it can be straight ahead or an angle in between. Most often I put it in the window to blow air in and on at least two occasions it's fallen out onto the floor without damage. It's just a very solid fan and I'm intending to buy a second one for even more air flow on those days when blowing in outside air can avoid the use of the A/C."
3,Where are the maps?,Richard Riehn has written a great book that is rendered almost unreadable by the complete lack of maps. His book features very detailed descriptions of troop movements and I was unable to fully appreciate and follow his obviously well researched book. It will always continue to amaze me why many authors fail to put maps in their books to allow the reader to follow the troop movements. I don't think I should have to have my world atlas on my lap while I read a book. Maybe future editions will add maps?
5,Haunting,"This is one of those albums that I bought and almost discarded on first listen - I'd heard Joseph Arthur sing 'In the Sun' accoustically on MTV, and thought it was worth investing in on the strength of that alone.There is so much going on in this record, both on the surface and below, that it takes a while to take it all in. The production is superb - lots of interesting sounds that add to the great moodiness of the songs - at times the backing music seems at odds with the songs, then, after a few more listens, it all makes sense. Personal highlights include 'Exhausted', which is a noisy rant with a great melody hidden within; 'History', which has superb lyrics and builds to an emotional climax; and 'Speed of Light', a gorgeous heart-broken ballad that ends the set.There are two or three songs which I still can't fathom, but that leaves nine or ten superb songs, and these days that's better than 99% of albums."
5,One of the better song writers of our time...,"He is getting more and more notoriety as his career progresses, and it is well deserved. Take the first song on the album alone and break it down...and you'll find brilliant writing and soul-searching.He maintains a sense of dignity throughout the album and you never get the impression that he is forcing any of this. You really believe that he's wandering like the rest of us.""And trying to find anything, you can feel...that you can believe in..."" speaks volumes of the human existence for most of us."
2,"In the trash it goes, it goes...","This is a nauseating disk. The songs about lost loves aresaccharic and cloying. It's distressing enough to know someone couldwrite this drivel but it is outright disturbing knowing it was recorded. If considering a purchase of the disk, I would wait for the poetry book that will inevitably follow. At least you can draw funny moustaches on the illustrations."
5,If you're sick of all the teen cheese on the radio....,"try this beautiful album. Arthur has never seemed to pay attention to musical trends; he doesn't write catchy jingles; he's not buffed; he doesn't sport any cool tattoos. At least none that I've seen. What he does do is create some of the most powerful, haunting songs I've heard. If he lives long enough, I think people will sling his name around with people like Leonard Cohen, Patti Smith, and Ben Harper. This album puts JA in that league. (Don't trust the audio samples on the page here-- they sound awful).I caught his live show in LA last week, which confirmed my impression: there's nothing fluffy about Arthur, nothing impressive but the music (and his art, esp. his painted guitars), and the music is all that matters.This is a gorgeous album, up there with Jeff Buckley's Grace and the Flaming Lips the Soft Bulletin."
5,A writer pure to poetry.,"Amazing Lyrics that illustrate images as you drift in his emotional music, mostly acoustic guitar accompanied by various instruments,that constantly reminds you of you. Very hook oriented. Get prepared to sing along and well into when the album has stopped its ride. You will wake up with these songs in your head, as if the clock radio had been playing them in your half-sleep.""Your history becomes your gravity"", Joseph Arthur.Not recommended for tough-guys."
2,"""Chemical"" charms, most of rest falls short...","Hearing ""Chemical"" on the radio gave me great hopes for this album, but I was quite disappointed. This may clearly be a personal issue, but the mode of my disappointment came in the form of Arthur's seemingly banal lyrics. Because the music is sparse, the vocals and lyrics are highlighted, and in listening to the album for the first time I found myself easily completing Arthur's couplets without having heard them. This could be a sign of my deep connection with the artist, but I think not. However, ""Chemical"" remains a great song and a good intro to this artist. If I perhaps was too sensitive while listening to this album, give it a try for yourself, but be forewarned."
2,"Bad tire, makes great boots.",This is the tire that came with my bacchetta strada. Both tires fell apart around the 1000 mile mark with the side walls just flaking off. I cut one of the tires up and made some really nice boots out of it for future flats on my continental tires. Two stars since it does make nice boots.
1,WRONG ITEM SENT,"I ordered two Kenda Kaliente TIRES. Received two Kenda INNER TUBES. Although, they had a LABEL saying they WERE Kenda Kaliente tires. Can't pull the wool over my eyes, I KNOW what a tire looks like! Had to spend an hour with Amazon customer service to fix this, as I was only sent ONE tire the second time.(I HOPE its a TIRE!) Should have gone to local bike shop and paid retail."
5,My phone has more storage now! Yippie!!!,This product is great! Plus I love the fact that it has its own adapter so transferring to my desktop is made easier considering I didn't bother to get a cable. Now I can hold more media files on my fone. Yay!!!!
3,Required For the Sony Ericsson w580i Phones,"When I dropped nearly $270 for my Sony Ericsson w580i phone, I was not happy that I had to spend another $20 plus for this teensy memory chip. They don't tell you that you can't store songs or pictures on your phone without it, so you're stuck. It works fine and it is so small (and kind of tricky to put in your phone) that it won't accidentally pop out. It works - that's all and 2 gb is plenty."
5,Works like it should,"When I got the card, I popped it into my Sony Ericsson Walkman phone, and it worked without a hitch. 2 more GB instantly."
4,A LITTLE LATE,I would have given the product a 5 but I received the item after Christmas day so it was a late Christmas present.
3,Ok but not 100% satisfied with Sony!,"I purchaced this memory card after my other one died that I had in my Sony Ericsson Cell Phone! I had about 438 pic's and video on the memory card that I lost cause the card failed!! I was taking pic's of a ski resort on a beautifull sunny day with snow covered mountains! The camera didn't indicate that the card was full...as I was taking pic's the picture didn't stay on the camera as it ussually does to wait for me to indicate what I wanted to do with the picture before taking another, save it, delete it,email it, etc. It did this 3 times then it just stopped reading the card!! Many pic's & video lost!!! The card wouldn't read anymore!! I recomend stay with products that use SD memory cards, they work with many different devices!!! Sony is exclusive, only works with Sony products!"
3,The open Bible,"the Bible was well represented. clearly stating facts and was accurate in every detail. I was happy with the purchase, will watch fior other books from amazon."
2,This was far more detailed than I wanted,This made me realize that there are many holes in my knowledge of my family's history. Obviously this made me uncomfortable. There is no one able to fill in the blanks for me. I thought there would be spaces for pictures and that it would be focused on my generation. I plan to return it.
4,Treasured Keepsake,"I purchased this book as gifts for some first time Grandmothers that I know. It's a wonderful book that prompts the writer to share stories of themselves, their parents, child and grandchild. I have something similiar from my Grandma. She gave it to me when I was in my 20's and it is a treasure for me. Great for people that have a family history they would like to share so that it doesn't get lost with time. Easy to fill out because it is not something that needs to be completed immediately, you can write stories as they come to you or as a new family memory happens. Every page has a ""prompt"" for the family history/information or story. I gave it 4 stars because I was under the impression when I ordered it that there would be room for family recipes and I didn't see an area for that when I looked through it. I will order it again."
5,Very useful but a lot of work,"With a spread out family and a few divorces and remarriages we can barely keep straight who is who! This book is perfect for families of multiple grandparents who want to share their side of the family with your new addition. We are expecting our first and got these for my two sets of parents and my wife's family. Hopefully one day our child will appreciate all the effort that goes into having this book filled out. While it can be tedious, think of it as a gift for the baby."
5,Urans,"Urans One of the 9 planets is shaped like an Easter Egg and never stops spinning,it is also very dark on the planet.It has giant craters. Jupiter is very large and has about 16 to 20 moons,one of them is a frozen dark moon,another one is covered with gas and rocks. All of them seem to be very unlivable Mars is called the red planet,and has volcanos but they are all driedup and don't europet any more."
5,Excellent value warehouse deal.,For about $12 you couldn't go wrong. Arrived quickly and blows hot air....what more could one want? So much better than e-bay!
2,Not so fantastic...,"I got this hair dryer in Fall of 2006. It worked great at first, but after about two and a half months of using it 2-3 times a week, the dryer lost most of its power. Instead of taking 5-10 minutes to dry my hair, it took at least 20, and even then my hair wasn't completely dried. Skip this hairdryer, find something better."
5,It's a hair dryer. It works.,I bought this item because it was cheap and it had a cool setting. I'm very pleased with this hair dryer. Now if only I could be pleased with my Hair... :)
4,Small and light hair dryer,"I bought this as a primary hair dryer. My hair is thin but I have lots of it. It goes to a little below my chin and almost to my shoulders. I needed a replacement dryer after my previous one died, but I am on this cost-savings mission and so I wanted to get one for as little money as possible. Therefore, I went on Amazon and did a search for dryers with 4+ star ratings and then sorted by price. This was the cheapest of the 4 star rating at the time of my search, which was maybe a few months ago. I like this dryer. It does what it advertises. It is light weight and has dual settings. You can make it blow cool or hot. I have found though that it does take longer to dry my hair with this dryer than with more expensive ones. So, while I do like this dryer, I think I would prefer a more expensive high powered model when my hair grows longer. For people with short hair or sparse hair or guys with crew cuts, I think this would be useful. For the price, this was very good."
2,Not what I'd expected,The soft pewter clasp design is such that the bracelet would easily come off your wrist. The two wolf heads shown in the picture are the only wolf figures. Cheaper in appearance in RL than it seems in the photo.
4,Comfy,I loved the bracelet. It's not as shiny as the picture but it is so light weight and easy to wear!
5,EXCELLENT VALUE,THESE ARE A EXCELLENT VALUE. AFTER A LOT OF SEARCHING LOCALLY AND ON THE INTERNET SINGLE 18 VOLT BATTERIES WERE RUNNING REAL CLOSE TO $80 DOLLARS. WHEN YOU CAN BUY TWO FOR $55 DOLLARS WHY SHOP ANYWHERE ELSE AND SPEND MORE FOR QENUINE 18 VOLT DEWALT BATTERIES.
5,I haven't read this book but i heard it was good.,I know that author neice and she said it was a good book and from the reveiws it looks good.
1,Great if you're looking for typos,"If you are a graduate student and your professor has assigned this book, I suggest that you implore him/her to do a search for another book ASAP. Concepts are poorly explained and worst of all, the book is filled with typos! In a subject that is already confusing enough as it is, incorrect equations and other errors are absolutely unacceptable."
1,"Horrible book, overprices,","my wife had to get this for a course at Northwestern.I have taken stats at 400/800 level course back in college. this book is horrible. I am struggling to understand why an instructor would use this book for a medical informatics course. looks like congress needs to investigate the text book racket going on. hundreds of dollars a stats book, wow."
2,"Good costumes, overacting, big stars getting a payday .","The highlight of this film is a fight scene between Marina Sirtis (Counselor Troi of Star Trek) and Faye Dunaway. Ms. Sirtis is topless throughout the scene. If you want to get the video for this reason then you will be happy. Otherwise forget it. Faye Dunaway puts in an acting performance, that if the movie was supposed to be funny, would be hilarious. Instead she just looks foolish. The costumes and scenery are quite lavish and besides Ms. Dunaway you will recognize the other actors. I think the producers were aiming high and probably spent a lot of money. The film just lacks umph."
3,Wicked acting! But a good story.,"Faye (overacting) Dunaway stars as Lady Skelton...a rich woman who must have something that someone else has...Money, a woman's fiancee'. She later turns into a robber on horseback to gain more wealth & meets Jackson...another robber & falls in love with him. She later betrays him when she finds him in bed with another woman (Marina Sirtis) Highlight of the film is the catfight between Sirtis & Dunaway WITH WHIPS! (whoa!) I must add there's a lot of ""naughty cheesecake"" displayed with some ""very interesting"" bedroom scenes. (Hence the ""R"" rating.)"
4,very enjoyable,This movie was intended to be tongue in cheek and not to be taken seriously. A lavish production with a good cast and Dunaway looks radiant. An interesting storyline keeps the action flowing in this highway robbery costume film. Too bad it`s not on DVD.
3,Brilliant Tony Banks soundtrack,"The best thing about this film is the soundtrack, written by Tony Banks (Genesis). Otherwise it is a dated bawdy romp."
5,Truth,This is a much needed message for the world today. In light of all that is happening in our world let us know the truth of the Scriptures as we are enlightened by the Holy Spirit. Thank you for revealing so much truth to those of us who wish to hear/read it.May Abba Father bless you and your future endeavors.
5,IF ONLY EVERYONE WOULD READ THIS BOOK,THIS BOOK WAS FANTASTIC = MY WORRIES AND HOPE WAS BROUGHT OUT IN THIS BOOK. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.WE NEED TO TURN BACK TO CHRIST AND LET GOD HEAL OUR NATION.
5,A Look Into Our Future,"American Prophecies is a must read for every American who has watched as a great society declined and wondered what's happening, why are we falling so fast and what can I do to stop this decline. My eyes are opened and my heart is set on what I must do. If only the rest of America could read this book and act before it's too late."
2,The American Prophecies,"This book has revealed that we can not just look back in the 1960 and say this world has really changed, we can see where the division of LIGHT and DARKNESS has been opposing each other since creation. The DARKNESS has always tried to cover the LIGHT and this is impossible. Mike Evans has shown us through history and truth given in God's Word, that we must be diligent in following God in His Word and Prayer. Thank You Mike for your vision and desire to write the truth. SL, Tennessee,USA"
5,American Prophecies Reveals Future,"The subject is current, important, and relevant. The book candidly reveals a relationship that promises blessings if continued, curses if not.The book is an important read and can change minds and explain events as few are able."
5,Why stand with Israel?,This book gives insight into the world stage we find ourselves playing on. A Christian perspective on the events and how Israel and America fit into God's plan as revealed in the Bible. A must read.
5,What more can be said,It's one of the most insightful books on the current conditions of the middle east. How it got this way and where we're headed is clearly seen in scripture for those who seek the truth. Mr. Evans has done a great job revealing some of the details to a message given long ago.
4,A 'must read',"This is a real wake up call. When these things are put into order, the pieces begin to form a clear picture that can not be denied."
5,The American Prophecies,"It is a good book - worthy of reading and passing along as a Christimas gift. It is interesting to note that books that are totally fictional and even insulting to a thinking person are listed as something worthwhile to read (as DaVinci Code) but not a book like this that shows what our future might well be - and soon. It will not hurt anyone to read this,The American Prophecies, and consider - it is better than fiction by far and very thought provoking."
5,Excellent,Is a wonderful overview of Islamic history and the history of Isreal's rebirth and the importance of God's promise to Abraham. It is frightening how blind we are as a nation Spiritually.
4,Israel a Lightening Rod,"Israel and the Jewish people have always been a lighening rod in the events of history. Why? why is such a tiny nation in a remote part of the world always in the center of history? Why has this small group of people had such an impact on science, art and finance? Why are they so consistantly hated by so much of the world? Could it be bacause God has chosen them to reflect his message to the world - to reveal himself to mankind?Today, Israel is once again on the front pages of history. How should America respond to this dynamic people today? Look inside ""American Prophecies"" and find out for yourself. Mike has laid it all out clearly for us."
5,"American Prophecies, A historical & Biblical Truth","I found this book to be a breath of fresh air!! As an Amercian Messianic Jew (also referred by some as a Hebrew Christian) I found it factual, historical & Biblically based. I have read many books on prophecy but, this is the 1st that tied historical, political& Biblical fact into data that I believe may ""open the eyes"" of even the secular reader who is searching for insight & answers to the ""state of the world today"". Israel has always been the #1 focus of Biblical prophecy & America has always appeared to ""be its watchtower"" I only hope & pray that people of all faiths will read it & come to understand G-d's revealing plan."
5,The American Prophecies: Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our ...,"I am happy to give Michael D. Evans a glowing review of his book, The American Prophecies. It is a comprehensive study of history so pertinent to understanding events and issues in the world today. Having all of this information compiled into one book is very enlightening as a guide to understand the progression of how we fit into history, God's plan, and the important players past and present. It is a must read!I have given two gift copies so far and will continue to promote this book."
1,Pure crank,"You have got to be kidding. This is unadultered extremist bible-bashing fantasy trash.This is incitement to hatred, intolerance and small-mindedness. You don't seriously believe this stuff do you? This guy would come to the same conclusions reading the phone directory."
1,This book is immoral,Why can't people be satisfied to read the Bible and see the great timeless principles that apply to ALL people in ALL times and in All circumstances?Why do people feel they need to interpret every current event from the evening news through some obsure biblical interpretive symbolic system?Can anyone see how a book like this takes the focus off of Jesus and places it on the 'hot' news of today which will soon be the old news of tomrrow?I'm saddened.
1,I smell a Rat,Scrolling through hundreds and hundreds of five star reviews for this book I started to get a very suspicious feeling. The majority of five star reviews are very short and impersonal sounding. They sound like blurbs on ads. If you click on the names of the people who wrote the reviews then you'll find that this is the only review that most of the people have done. There's something very fishy going on here.
2,"Review of ""The American Prophesies.""","I was disappointed with this book. While the documentation is well done, the ultimate premise is tenuous, and left me unsatisfied."
1,More fundamentalist tripe,"Mike Evans, the author of this book, is a bit concerned. He writes, ""The American Prophecies has been in stores less than 48 hours, and we are receiving an organized wave of attacks against the book. Obviously, there are large numbers of people who hate Israel and the Word of God. They are trying to destroy the rating of the book in the hope that the book will die."" As with a great many fundamentalists, Dr. Evans sees the world in extremely stark, black and white pigments. Because some dare to criticize his book, he erroneously deduces that these people ""hate Israel and the word of God"". This moronic, us-versus-them mentality tells you everything you need to know: save your money and don't support this guy's hate-filled drivel."
5,The Holy Bible and America,Captivating reading for both Christians and the biblically inquisitive. I believe even those who claim to be atheist may find the relationship between ancient prophesies and contemporary events to be of interest.
5,American Prophecies,"It is typical that this world would seek to silence anyone who would seek to open the eyes of the blind people of this once free nation, who once enjoyed Gods abundant blessings and grace. Satan is the great deceiver and seeks to devour everyone. In 1 Corinthians 1:18 is is written: For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. We hold to the faith and the hope of Christ's return for His bride and pray that we continue to run the good race while it is still ""light"" for ""darkness"" is quickly approaching and covering our land. I recommend this book to all who want to know what is in store for this nation and all of those who still continue to refuse to acknowledge that Christ is the son of God and the only hope that you have while you are in this world. Decide today whom you will serve... for tomorrow may be too late!"
5,My husband got his hands on this book before I could read it,"And he has been in rapture with this book. I asked him to write what he thought about it...and he is what he penned: ""When we hear truth, our inner being responds and mine did to this book. This book is not comforting but is extremely important because it is historically accurate & prophetically compelling. The present day world is dangerous & in order for us to survive the growing threats of terrorism, we have to recognize its source. Michael Evans defines our enemies & clearly explains how we can prosper as a nation & achieve lasting peace personally."""
5,American Prophecies; Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our Nations F,"I enjoyed reading Michael D. Evans book,and at times I couldn't put it down. Mr. Evans presents some very amazing facts about our nation and the choices we have made in the past. If you are a praying person or like history this is a must read book. L.M."
5,A message that is needed in America,"I am grateful for Mike Evans and his dedication to speak the truth in print that others can know.It is my prayer that every law maker in Washington would read"" The American Prophecies"" and humbly take heed to the truth that is revealed in its pages.May the Lord truly bless America.Rev. Brackett"
5,My Interest In Prophecy Related To End Times,"Many Ministers Prophecies have crossed my desk, resulting in my reading and comparing them to actual scriptures. I find""American Prophecies"" to be very accurate in following these Scriptures. It is well written, historical, thoughtful and interesting. I recommend this book to everyone. Read it and pray that God will reveal the meaning to you."
5,Excellent!!,"People can bash this book all they want, but it doesn't discourage us that KNOW the Word of God and that it is truth. The outrage over the popularity of this book confirms what we believe, the Enemy is always working to discredit and keep the truth hidden. A must read!!"
1,Should have read the new Harry Potter book,"Trust me, I can't stand Bush, but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Which is why I picked up a copy of this book to see the other side of the coin and get a glimpse into the mindset of our leader. If he is devoted to this, I think I just saw the hamster jump off the wheel. This is a grade A pile of nonsense, speculation, religious ranting and raving with very little actual context to back up any of his claims. A monkey can take the bible and make it read any way he wants it too, that's not a problem, what is a problem is when some two-bit hack takes it and starts feeding it any which way he wants.I found it funny how he convienantly threw in 9-11, as if he was such an expert on the matter. If Evans had any credility, don't you think he would have made these assertions PRIOR to 9-11. ""Ah yeah, I'm an expert on Jesus,"" Anyone 2 AD. I mean, stop wasting valuable resources like paper on this garbage and read something that matters."
3,Ancient Works,"I see a lot of possibilities in this work, but I need futherstudy and research and discernment to set each claim in orderbefore I can give the book full support. It does make one thinkupon reading the book, and I do not condemn the work, nor can Iproclaim the work as the full truth at this stage. I do commendone to fully read the book before rendering an opinion."
1,Evans tacitly endorses the Quran?,"There's something rather strange about this book...Michael Evans presents the Ishmael = Arabs idea. The problem with that is that this idea is NOT found in the Bible. Where is it found? Hold on to your hat people. It comes from Arab mythology...including the Quran. Given that, Evans is tacitly accepting those two sources as divinely inspired :) It's not very often you see a Christian unknowingly endorsing Islam...and then receiving tons of praise for it.I suggest that anyone even remotely interested in this subject look this up for themselves if they don't believe me. They will not find even one passage in the Bible stating that Ishmael is the progenitor of the Arabs. (Look VERY carefully into those claims) Indeed, the Internet is chock full of conservative Christian sites rebutting this Islamic claim! Given that, I'm astonished that this book is receiving so much praise."
1,American HATE: A Return to the Dark Ages,"This book and countless screeds like it are just plain bad for your soul.In the immortal words of Jon Stewart, ""Stop. You're hurting America."" Not to mention the rest of the world. Not to mention our species' very existence.For an fascinating, sane, wry take on the sickness and sadness of contemporary Christian eschatology, check out Gershom Gorenberg's wonderful book, ""The End of Days."" Here's a link to its amazon.com page:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195152050/qid=1125953642/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-0458767-8239015?v=glance&s;=books"
5,hooray!!! for the American prophecies book.,"I totally agree with the thinking behind this book written by Mr.Evans...A servant cannot serve two masters,God and Satan;Nor can a servant of God be against Israel, for they are his chosen people,and the apple of his eye, and Satan's plan is destroy them; as he has tried to in the past.This book written by Mr. Evans is a must read for the christians of the world,it puts the plight of the Jews in it's proper perspective...... this one get's an ""A""Michael K. Bentley"
5,The Truth,Mike brings out the truth about what's going on in the middle east and America. This will give you the truth compared to what is in the liberal media. Read with enjoyment
5,a must read,what a revelation!!! every man woman and teenager should read this book. Keep an open mind and look to see just how in control of this world the Living God still is.
4,Review of American Prophecies,"Mike Evans book,""American Prophecies,Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our Nations Future"" is a well-research book about end-times prophecies. Mr. Evans is very careful not to use scripture out of context. This book is fascinating and easy to read. I recommend it to every student of Bible prophecy.Betty S. Cochran"
5,Something to think about,"If you truly understand prophecy in the context of the Bible as a whole, this book sizes up America pretty accurately..."
5,"The american Prophecies, A MUST read for the truth","In reading ""The american Prophecies"", I find it gives me insight of current events, and shows me the importance of standing for the Jewish Nation and our Christian Heritage."
5,Thank God for The American Prohpecies,I asked God to help me understand what is going on in the Middle East and He led me to this book. I thank God and Mike Evans for all the Scriptures and information he has generously given to me in this book. I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!
5,Take your head out of the sand:(,"If you think terrorism is not real and that it has not been told to us over the years, read the book and read the Bible. I have known this all along. I read the Bible. This book on the Prophecies is well worth the read. Mike Evans knows what he is talking about. Just give it a read."
5,Great Insight,The American Prophesies offer great insight into our current world politcal scene-it takes great courage to write about the Biblical accounts of the coming of the Messiah in this day and age-especially when those out of touch with the Bible consistently attack any mention of Christ centered writing about the end times-God has said it and it will be so-Great reading for those interested in our future and what the Lord God says about it.
1,History for the Lobotomized,"I'm so stunned I can barely speak. The text is nothing less than a call for all-out war against the Muslim world, based on spurious interpretations of so-called Biblical prophecy intertwined meaninglessly with ultra-right-wing views of American history. It's worse than nonsense, as it plays on the extreme political and cultural tensions of our current era, seeking to motivate already unstable fundamentalist Christians toward a goal that would be disastrous for our great nation. The author is careless at best to take this course; it's likely that he is of the utterly insane Dispensationalist stripe that actually wants to hasten the ""end of the world"" by engaging America in a nuclear conflict. Only those whose repulsive, twisted worldview includes precipitating global war in the service of their tribal god-image should bother to read this; it reads like a mirror image of an al-Qaeda polemic against the West, and should be treated with the same level of contempt and horror."
5,Only for those interested in the Preservation of America,"After reading the book, one is left with the distinct impression that our nation has gone down the wrong road for more than 50 years. We've accepted murder of the pre-born on demand, promiscuity in children as young as 8 or 9, and have turned our backs on Israel. We will be judged more harshly on the last item than the former two. When a known terrorist is welcomed to the White House as a ""freedom fighter"" and diplomat, God must shed a million tears. Unless we want our nation to be subjected to further social decay and terrorist attacks, we need to change this NOW!"
4,"America's role in Israel's past, present and future","Michael D. Evans is a Biblical scholar and longtime student of Jewish history. He writes a Biblically backed case for recommending that the United States stay an active friend of Israel or suffer the consequences. In our politically correct society, his views may be ridiculed; yet they ring true. As one who prays for our nation, I was glad to be informed of how to pray with regard to Israel and the Mid-East and our involvement."
5,The American Prophecies,I am a Pastor and this book held me spellbound. What a insightful and refreshing book on Biblical prophecy. It is a must for anyone who wants to understand our world and our future. This book will be available to our entire congregation.Mark EnglishFirst Assmebly of God
1,More American Bashing,"In spite of everything good about this book it is ruined by statements like this one referring to American presidents and finally Americans in general:""---in other words, if they had acted on prophecy instead of disregarding it --it could well have saved the lives of the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust, as well as the lives of those persecuted in Russia and elsewhere in the world. America's inaction during this time is as responsible for the Holocaust as the silence of the German church in the 1930s and 1940s.""Michel D. EvansThe American PropheciesPages 60-61So there you have it, the real villain of the Holocaust is the USA. Mr. Evans has sold his last book to me."
1,Too Biased to be Relevant,"I enjoy books about prophecy as well as biblical studies, so I delved into this book eagerly only to be horrified at the author's blatant hatred and prejudice against the Arabs. This book has a clear agenda and it is decidedly not a Christiam one - no mention here of loving thy neighbor or forgiving thine enemies. The author makes comments like ""they hate us simply because they hate us"" which make it hard for me to believe that he has spent any significant amount of time of time in the Middle East."
1,Fundamentalist tripe with simplistic answers,"I have never seen the Bible so deeply misconstrued and the underimportance of prophecy so emphasized. Good exegesis, much history and a large dollop of thought would go a long way toward this book's most necessary accessory - a good rewrite.Perhaps some fair and balanced reporting might help!However, I smell a series. Don't waste your money!"
1,The DaVinci Code,The DaVinci Code is a work of fiction with an ungodly premise that is being accepted by many as fact!
5,Must Read,"This is a very powerful and informative book. If you can't already see that God's plan is rushing to completion, read this book and take another look at the news."
5,The American Prophecies,"I am amazed at how the true History of Israel has been presented. I wonder if the critics have bothered to really reseach what Mike has written. Why are people so afraid of the truth. We who claim to be real Christians (which means we are new creations) all have a testimony as to what Christ Jesus has done in our lives, and it is real and tangible. Truth is the only thing that will set a person free. Darkness is covering the eyes of many and they don't see the truth of this most informative and enlightening book. Please Lord let people see the truth. Thanks Mike, God knows!!!"
5,"The American Prophecies, by Michael D. Evans","In my opinion every American, no, every Christian needs to read this book. The need for our country to align itself with Isreal is unmistakable. Michael Evans takes the events of today and puts them into the proper perspective. This book has made a profound impact on me and I know it will for whoever is blessed with the opportunity to read it. -RS. Newbrough"
1,The Davinci Code,"While as interesting as it was, it is entirely false, and full of crap. The historical significance of it was astonishingly fake, and every one knows the truth. Want a good book, try the bible."
5,"America, Get Your Act Together!","I am well aware of the New Age religion(s) and the damage they are doing to Christianity. This book really explains a lot of things, most definitely the book of Revelation. The Jews are still the promised people of God, and Islam is a dangerous cult. America could experience another 9-11 if she doesn't get her act together. The King is coming....soon! Will we be ready? Look at all the signs of the end times that are happening right now.Can we really be certain that all the hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean this year are not a warning from God Almighty? His wrath will strike all those who do not believe His Word, the Holy Bible. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords is coming again, and we must be ready. America has a place in prophecy; she must defend the nation of Israel. To do otherwise will surely invoke the wrath of God. Events are taking place; now is the time. Now is the day of salvation. America, get ready! Your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is coming back...SOON!"
5,Lovers of Truth and Seekers of Knowledge,"American Prophecies is not a book you can just sit down and read without being moved to check it out in the Bible. Our society is so used to being spoon fed, and fed only feel-good mush, that many of us will find it uncomfortable and a little difficult to grasp. But Truth is Truth no matter who denies it......so read it for yourself, and discuss it with those who are open-minded enough to really delve into the contents."
3,Not as advertised,"The book was advertised to be ""new"" and the packing slip also said this book was ""new"". However, the book was definitely not ""new""."
5,Excellent Book,"this book is great, I opened it just to see how it was written before I realized it I had read 15 pages. It is written so clearly and concisely that it absorbs you. It takes the Bible and History(real history not PC stuff) together and makes them understandable. We really should remember how we treat Isreal will determine what will happen to this country. We need to elect leaders who understand this also"
5,Needed for Today's Generation,I feel this book should be required reading for all high school and college age youth as well as all adults. This book tells of what God says about America. Israel and the end times which are fast approaching
5,Well done and needed,"True to its name, it speaks to our situation(s) here in America and it lines up to what the scriptures say."
3,American Prophecies,"While I doubt that God would agree with everything Mr. Evans has written [as regards some details, Irwin Baxter might be more accurate], his assessments are not as ill-founded as some conclusions his detractors have reached, one of them being that God is incapable of using anger (much less wrath) as an expression of love. The Bible, understood properly, is far more accurate than popular secular outlook gives it credit for. Indeed, more accurate than that particular outlook, in that the Bible's Author is neither ignorant nor brainwashed."
1,A must-read for all Americans,The American Prophecies is the best Christian book I have ever read. It opened my eyes to the need for the United States to support the nation of Israel as well as all Jewish people all over the world. The Jew is dear to the heart of God and all peoples should respect them.
3,The American Prophecies a good book,I liked reading this book but there is one other possible way the the US and England are in prophecies. I was covered in Gensis to Ephream and Manasisa by Jacob when he first came to see Josephs son's.
5,Know the truth or sleep in darkness.,"This author certainly has done his research and has had the courage to document the truth, the bottom line truth of the anti-semitism that fuels most of the heartless and cruel rage of the terrorist mentality. History speaks to those who will listen.Though its frightening to realize how we as a nation have ""mortgaged our soul"" in dependency on oil provided by terrorist harboring nations, this book does give much hope to those who will be open to listen to and act on the TRUTH. The history of the world as we know it has been revised by too many ""historians"" with their own agendas that exclude the God of Israel and the world."
5,The American Prophecies,This is such an informative book and anyone who believes the Bible is the word of God must see how the prophecies are certain. We need to wake up in America.
3,The American Prophecy,This was a very well prepared document and should be well received by the Christian community. It was hard to putdown. Well done Michael.
5,Michael Evans is right on target.,"We haven't the right to claim ""Christian nationhood"" here in the United States of America (""My Kingdom is not of this world,...but now my kingdom is from another place,"" Words of Jesus at John 18:36), but we have certainly had Christian presidents forming our legacy as a nation. Some (most?), were not professed Christians at all. God alone is the judge of ones' right or wrong standing before His throne, in the end. Christian nation? We have no such right. But, whether or not we acknowledge Him, God swears to be the One who alone sets up kings and governments over men.Michael Evans has done a splendid job of presenting our place as a nation in worldwide events. I highly recommend his book.Sharon SullivanAuthor-in-waiting, ""Fully Recovered Catholic"""
5,Michael Evans' work is one inspired by God!,I believe that God has laid on Mr. Evans a burden to enlighten the world of the promises of His Word - God's prophecies have come to light in the past and will continue in the future. Wake Up America!!
5,This book is about raw Truth,"The Truth in this book is based on prophecies from long ago, events of today (including some events being prophecy fulfilled), and how the two combined ( prophecies & events) will mold our future according to God's Will. -- Raw Truth is hard for many to accept, especially in this case if the Holy Spirit is not present in the reader's life. Yes, the book is controversial, but I believe it was written for this time in history by a heart dedicated to the cause of God's Glory for His people Israel and the gentiles grafted into that olive branch. 9/11 WAS A WAKE UP CALL FROM HELL. THIS BOOK IS A WAKE UP CALL FROM GOD. Peace / Shalom."
5,Godly Inspired,I am thankful that there are still men of God preaching and teaching the Word of God and revealing truth in Scripture. Thank you Mike Evans.
5,Awesome,"This book is one of the most informative I have ever read. It's about time someone brought to the forefront that our nation was created with principles and morals set forth by the bible. In today's times of division in our country, we need to be reminded that you can't pick and choose what part of our constitution you adhere to and what parts you don't. While freedom of speech is one of our many rights, let's not forget that ONE NATION UNDER GOD was the main premise and should remain that way. This book reminds us of that and many other key factors that could and will impact our future as a nation as well as our destiny with our Lord."
5,The American Ppophecies,Iloved this Book it's easy to see how it's been researhed tofind all the facts very enlightening Clarity in a World ofconfusion Best book I've read in a long time very much of aneye-opener need more books to make see the times we're inThank YouDavid P Showers
4,"Compelling, thought-provoking, well-articulated book","The author(s) make for a great case, clearly and well defining the prophecies as laid out in scripture. Biblical information is pulled correctly (within context), and biblical prophecy is intelligently and articulately discussed. Well written book, definately worth a few bucks for you to read."
5,Outstanding,"This book gives details, and information, that is generally not available through normal history books. Mike Evans documents everything, and the lack of action by American leaders for the last 150 years is stunning. Highly recommended."
1,when are you going to wake up?,"I cannot believe in the reviews I read here... You Americans can be real fascists when you want... some of you apparently believe in one kind of god that fits only in primitive societies... try to understand, world is bigger than your country (a great and beautiful country, I have to say, full of great values)."
1,Are you people off your rockers!?!?,"How can anyone believe this pile of monkey dung??Are we as Americans so naive, that we will believe this nonsense.I for one hope not. For if we are, then we truly are doomed. Not to become extinct but to become mindless zombies who will believe anything that is thrown in front of us."
2,Must Read,This is a MUST read for believers and unbelievers alike. Those who are unbelivers need to hear God's truth. It is my prayer that this book will open their hearts and minds to the reality of what God has promised.
5,Makes You Think,"Coming from an ""average"" Christian who does not have a lot of knowledge on the history of the Middle East, this is a very enlightening book and a must-read for anyone concerned about the future of our nation.Mike Evans writes very directly, and is unapologetic about his opinion on this issue, but given the criticality of this issue, I found this style of writing to be justified. Regardless of the strength of your religious beliefs, this book truly makes you think. Thanks to this book, I find myself researching more and more into the foundation that our great nation was built upon, and the seriousness of where are actions are taking us."
5,The American Prophecies: Ancient Scripture Reveal Our Nation,This book is a real revelation of what our future holds. It is hard to put it down!!!!!
5,A different view of America future,"Thrilling, mysterious, revealing, prophetic, inspiring, biblically supported, historically challenging, and intellectually provocative. I recommend this book for every American who wants to see the United States recovering its spiritual heritage and divine mission on earth. Now more than ever we need books that give us a biblically and prophetic perspective about America and its role in the world. This book can create a spiritual awakening and a sense of urgency to save this country from destruction."
5,American Prophecies in Bible prophecy,"American Prophecies is the best expose on the truth and vital information about today's Middle East, to date. Those who have too quickly dismissed this gift, written by Mike Evans, should be wise and look at the world around them---then admit something is badly amiss in man's relationship with man and man's inability to interpret the Bible and the Bible's warnings. Even as anti-semitism is again on the rise those who least care are the same one's attempting to challenge Mike Evan's book. Finally, we indeed live in a dangerous period and could quickly sink into war, disease, famine and death. We must examine our own blindness and seek to, individually, know and understand God's words concerning His people."
5,Reason prevails,"Finally someone has made a Biblically rational argument for current problems, all based upon strictly objective interpretations of the Bible. The more you read, the more the author's arguments are strengthened, revealing its truths, and accuracies."
5,God Means What He Says,"Mr. Evans gives a very scholarly view of exactly what God is saying in the Bible prophecy. There is really not much room for argument unless one does not believe that the Bible is truly the Word of God. God has said what He meant and He meant what He said. He has made it very clear that whoever blesses Israel He will bless and whoever curses Israel He will curse. Whether we like it or not, He makes the rules and if America turns her back on Israel look out! Everyone who reads this book with an open mind and honesty will see the truth of it."
5,The American Prophecies,"I don't even have to read this book to recommend it. Mike Evans is one of the most discerning leaders in America. He understands how important it is for the United States to always stand with Israel, because to do so is to stand with God.Those who do oppose Israel oppose God's program and will be judged."
4,be Prepared,There is a great need for books that include scripture to reinforce their views. I appreciate the honesty and knowledge that is set forth.Thank you for your work.
5,"Awsome, Fantastic!",This book changed the way I look at my life the lives or others and the way I see the future. Wonderful.
1,Inaccurate,"Though the DC is entertaining, it is so inaccurate as to true history.This book, in a subtle way depicted as fact, however, it is an attempt at revisionist history. It is dangerous to elicit revisionist history. Some readers will not check authentic original texts."
1,Please stop the hatred,The American Prophecies is full of distortions of God's Holy Word and outright lies about Palestinians. Terrorism is wrong - period- but the majority of Palestinians are simply trying to get through the day just like you and me. Evan's books completely disregard the fact that there are Palestinian Christians who are suffering terribly under Isreali illegal occupation. Would Jesus support the torture and murder of the people He Himself converted to follow Him? Please pray for the writer and followers of this Christian Zionist heresy.
4,A Valid view. Keep an open mind.,"In spite of what the unknowing say, there is every reason to believe the events laid out here. If you do not think the Bible is accurate, you are reading somebody else's mail. This is not the forum to argue the various belief systems. This book puts forth a view that many, many people hold. Read it with an open mind and make up your own mind.The same people who hold the DaVinci Code as true, would probably choke on this. Learn where we came from and where we may be going."
5,Finally a book that tells the truth.,The American Prophecies gives guidance and hope for the future of America.There have been so many recent books that have re-written history to suit the author and in many cases totally lied.I recommend this for people who care about the future of our country and would like some positive answers.D. Wilson
5,American Prophecy Insight,Very insightful book - helped me understand so many issues normally surrounded by confusion and lies
5,American Prophecies,"What a book! A must read! The godless have no clue thus fear truth. Truth in their future. Remember, ""every knee WILL bow and every tongue WILL confess"". This book just brings fear and rebellion from non believers because it's in line with the scriptures of the Bible - The infallible Word of God!"
5,Gratitude for Truth,"Growing up in a family which honored and read the Bible, I have heard this ""truth"" since a small child. I KNOW that God is in control, and His plan will be fulfilled, whatever the human mind and voice can imagine and deceive others with...this book gives me a peace and hope that many are listening to that inner voice of truth and responding."
5,The American Prophecies,I found this book to be extremely informative. I had no idea that our country and Israel were so closely related. It helps me to understand the present strife in the mid-east.
5,Where we are Headed,Watch out America. Follow the word of God and believe in Him. This book is a must read. This book will open your eyes to what is in store if we don't wake up.
1,The Religious Right At Its Worst,"Evans is crazy. No, we do not have to militarily support Israel and kill all Muslims. What is he trying to do, start World War III?????? It sounds like Evans is in a hurry to start Armageddon right away.Evans does not worship Jesus. Jesus is a pacifist. Evans does not even know Jesus. Evans is just a deluded, deranged, sick man."
5,Best at Linking Prophecy and History,"Mike Evans has done a wonderful job coupling American history with Biblical prophecy. Again and again, the Bible truth, of blessings upon those who bless Israel and curses upon those who curse Israel are shown through historical events.Never seen a more readable approach to history. Never dull or boring. A must read for all interested in America's future and the end-times."
5,Excellent,"One of the most relevant books on Bible Prophecy relating to America's present and future in world events. A very exciting, revealing, and challenging book every Christian should read."
5,The American Prophecies:Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our Natio,"There is no doubt that non believers will scoff at this work. The information closely parallels Bibical Prophecy in its simplest form. The book is well written, and should cause allreaders to reflect on the possibilities of world events foretold from the ancients. Having read some of the reviews, I get a minute understanding of what Paul must have suffered and experienced while proclaiming the teachings of Jesus. Acts Chapter 28 verses 26-28 affirms as much regarding non-believers"
5,Freedom and democracy,"An interesting interpretation of the history. Using biblical references, the author shows the undisputable ties between the largest democracy in the America and its little sister in the Middle East. Should the USA submit to terrorists like so many other european wanna-be-great states did and turn its back on Israel? You read the book and decide for yourself."
5,"Wish I could give it 1,000 stars !","Biblically accurate and right-on according to the Scriptures. Literally is the way God meant us to interpret the Bible unless otherwise noted IN the Bible. Anyone with eyes to see knows that current events are unfolding according to Biblical prophecy, to the letter ! God is gracious to let His servants know what's going to happen before it happens, and Mike Evans is right to utilize God's prophecies as tools to warn our nation and the world of what's coming, as we are supposed to do as watchmen on the wall. Go for it, Mike, and God be with you !"
5,The most interesting and powerfull book in this days ....,"The most interesting and powerfull book in this days ....after the Bible, of course.I congratulate its author, Mike Evans, by its value in saying what America and the world need to listening. For some razon the enemies of the gospel are so angry with this servant of God.Sincerely,Dr. A. VallejoECC"
5,The American Prophecies,Michael Evans has done an excellent job of telling it like it is in relation to what the scriptures say about the United States and our prophetic involvement with Israel!
5,Thank you,"Amazon review.Thank you to all you closed minded bigots who are anti anything God . I had not even thought of reading this book until I saw how your hatred and anger came out about it. Now I will purchase and read this book. Thank you again for showing me that it is something that angers all you narrow minded people who have the audacity to say there is no God. By making that kind of adamant statement you try to put you're self on a par with God. Unless you are God, how can you know there is no God.Keep up the good work of pointing thinking people to read whatever it is that you hate.Bill"
5,Accolades for The American Prophecies,"Dear Michael Evans,I have read your book cover to cover three times. It is the most insightful and informative book you have written, and I thank you for your obedience to the Holy Spirit in giving it to those of us who appreciate all the effort and research that brought this work to fruition. God has anointed it and it is powerful. Keep writing, Michael, we need you.Rev. J. Krempel"
5,The American Prophecies: ancient scriptures reveal our natio,"I truely agree with this book and hope that many Americans will read it. If America does not wake up to repentance and turn their hearts back to God, we will be under the judgment of God and His wrath if worse than Sept 11 or any terrorist attack,."
5,American Prophecies,"It is not politically correct in the Western Intellectual World to connect current events with biblical prophecy. But there is a compelling connectedness. The descendants of Ishmael and Esau did not decide to hate Israel and America because of our ""adventures."" I believe that the American recognition of Israel did not ""just happen."" As General Marshall advised Pres. Truman, recognizing Israel would be a major mistake. We acted consistent with prophecy. Mr. Evans does us a service by putting this awareness before the public. I believe that many of our internal problems might be solved if we treated this awareness with respect."
1,#1 BOOK,"""FREELY YOU HAVE RECIEVED...FREELY YOU SHOULD GIVE""....JESUSI COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY THIS BOOK...PARENTS COULDN'T EITHER...WHAT GIVES????ANYWAY......."
5,The American Prophecies: Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our Natio,Awesome book - most informative. Every politician and citizen should read this book.
5,#1,"The best I have read yet about the on-going conflict in the middle east and America's relationship to the players and events. Clearly we are on dangerous ground. Clarifying, enlightening and (depending on your position),encouraging. Everyone should read it, Secularists, Christians, Jews or Muslims."
5,Unbelievers have Caused Prophecies to Come to Pass.,"I find Biblical prophecies, and sincere attempts at making them relate to today's events very fascinating reading. If we go into ancient history and start comparing old testament prophecies with actual events, the miraculous nature of the bible cannot be denied by an honest person. Only time will tell how Mr. Evansexplanations will work out in exact events. Concerning Israel, I can only say to the doubters, the prophecies concerning the fate of those who try to destroy, ""the apple of God's eye"", are really frightening to say the least."
4,The Truth Can Hurt,"I can't say that I agree totally with the whole book. However, I do agree that Israel should not be divided. The Bible strictly warns against this. True Christians are not haters as some would argue. We hate only what God hates, SIN! He's instructed us to use compassion and to suffer for His name when necessary; as anyone would do for any cause. At the same time, we also realize we have rights as American citizens and strive to live peaceably with ALL men with as much as lies in us. Thank God He is compassionate and forgiving or no one would have a chance."
5,The truth shall set you free,tHIS IS AN OUTSTANDING PIECE OF LITERATURE. WELL WRITTEN AND ORGANIZED AND ABOVE ALL......HONEST AND TRUTHFUL!!!
3,Could Mike Evans Be a Mordern Day Prophetic Man,"Just a reply to the critic that calls Mike Evans an Enemy of Isreal. When we look at things politically, we always come down on the ""right"" of things. Is it because righteousness for a christian is about right doing? I challenge the letter writer to review what he's been saying. No man that is an enemy to a nation or another human will be will be willing to lay down his life and finances to do what God tells him for a nation many people world wide actually hate. He is a man close to God as he is consistant with his obeying God, going to Isreal to tell them what God has said. Isreal is obviously no different to bible days they ridicule the prophets and do what they want to do until God allows something to happen before they turn to him."
5,American Prophecies,This is a very important book for everyone to read. Michael Evans has an amazing insight into the dire threat posed to us all because of a fundamentalist fanaticism which has its birth in the Middle East.I am highly recommending it to friends.
5,Much Needed Truth!!!,It's time we take our heads out of the sand and look straight into the eyes of the truth. Michael Evans has done just that for us in The American Prophecies. People who are confused about why terrorism is a part of our world today will find the answers to their questions in this book. Read this book and you WILL understand what is behind the spirit of the terrorists and you WILL have clarity as to where you stand in it all.
4,The American Prophecies,"I'm glad You included some of the history in your book. People need to know from where these terorists come from, and their activities. They need to know the Muslim teaching as well, that we could be prepared for their attack inside America. We are not secure as many people think. We need to approach God in our prayers to support Israel and to pray for salvation of people. That's why we're still here. Too bad that Mike does'nt include in his book, that American government is using terrorism to advance their Globalist agenda! Thanks Mike for an Excellent book"
1,Pure fiction,"This author is delusional. But he won't listen to a Christian. His only authority is satan. The two of them will be good company for each other. Mr. Evans is not interested in facts, only his brand of fiction. Stick to the facts."
1,I smell a rat as well,"I'm all for good, religious material but this looks like a PR job from the author. I got an email from the Jerusalem Prayer Team saying that they are ""asking God for 400 reviews on Amazon to build a firewall against the New Age God-haters."" I wonder if it is to build a firewall against the ""God-haters"" or is it to boost sales? Amazon should look into this. If the author is inflating the reviews then he should be punished. God doesn't like liars Michael! Bad boy, bad boy. ""smacks on the nose with a rolled up newspaper."""
1,More religious gloom and doom,"Yet another dark, BORING ""interpretation"" of the Bible and ""the end times."" If God truly wants us to know our fate, this critic believes he would send a true prophet and not yet another fundamentalist minister spouting the same message we've heard from other False Prophets through the last two millennia since Christ left us. Christians could read ""Left Behind"" and get the same basic message. Read the Bible instead of this and get the TRUE word of God."
1,Disgusting,The glowing reviews for this book are obviously fake and their ratings even more so. This is disgusting. Somebody at Amazon must do something about this.
3,Abominable binder,"This product is good at first but the double thickness fabric that is held by the velcro, separates after a few weeks of use.This causes the 'held' end to curl outward, making it difficult to hide under clothes"
5,A Great Starting Point to learn about Opera,"I picked up this book to use as a resource for an independent study course I was taking on the History of Classical Music and Opera. Turns out this book was amazing. It is a great starting point for those that may not know a lot about Opera. For those that know a bit about Opera, this offers quite a few new bits of information. Not only do you learn the basic definitions of opera, but you also get a bit of history and how opera has evolved through time. However, this book does not come with a CD so I recommend looking at Opera videos and songs through iTunes or YouTube or from your own collection."
1,Unreliable,"Question the analytical ability of an author who, in recommending the Sills recording of ""Julius Caesar,"" thinks that the Italian text is sung in English. More to the point, ignore a critic who clearly doesn't listen to the recordings he evaluates."
5,Recipients Loved It!,The basket arrived promptly and the recipients said they really enjoyed the contents.The arrangement was very pretty and the food was tasty. I plan to order this item again.
4,Nice Gift Basket,We have ordered this gift basket twice now for two different Presidents that had a heart attack and bypass heart surgery. They were well received and we will continue to order this basket in the future.
2,shipping,"We are extremely unhappy with the shipping of this product. no card and no two day delivery as promised.I ordered this product as a sympathy gift for family out of state. A tuesday delivery was expected, but the basket only was received on saturday. And there was no card. They didnt even know where it came from... how disappointing. Amazon, you dropped the ball on this one.They said the basket itself was beautiful."
3,Undecided,"I'm not sure what to think of this book. At no more than 60 pages it's little more than a short story, a teaser. It didn't wholeheartedly engage me, suck me into the characters' world, I was able to get up and leave it without a quam. One might put this down to the 'short story' factor, an intricate, twisting plot, which would have kept glued to my seat would have been a little much for 60 pages worth of story.All of that said, the story did not make me scoff, neither did it cause me to slap palm to forehead and groan aloud in tolerant disgust (as with so many other vampire and romance books). This is a book I would well consider *killing* for to see it in a larger, expanded version, giving greater life to the characters and challenging the reader with a plot that actually makes them think.And right now, what I think, is that I might just lay money down for the next instalment, if for no other reason than to cease being undecided."
5,Impossible to put down!,"I started reading this book on a Saturday afternoon and, regretfully, put it down when I couldn't stay awake any longer. The author draws you into the story so completely that all else is forgotten. The characters seem like people you know and the plot is captivating. I was very impressed. There actually are clues to the ending, unlike other mysteries I've read. Although it's difficult, you CAN figure this one out if you recognize the clues. That made it more fun for me, to solve the mystery along with Detective Kierzek. You just have to read it, period."
5,a mystery not to be missed,"After reading the authors first novel,""In the Shadows of the Moonglade"", I've eagerly awaited his next book. ""Deception"" is well worth the wait. A beautifully written and gripping mystery, I was quickly drawn into the plot and the lives of the characters, especially that of Detective Kierzek, an excellent cop and truly decent man. I hope to see more of him in future books. This is a story that will keep readers hanging on, guessing and gasping, 'til the last page."
3,It kept me glued to my chair to the very end,"Riveting, with a constant, excited impetus pulling you from one chapter to the next. If you think you can usually figure out a mystery novels twists and turns, you're going to be challenged and pleasantly surprised. No cardboard cutout characters here. Everyone is most believable, credible,and dealing with a series of perflexing circumstances surrounding the death of a married, socially prominent, sucessful artist, who is involved in an extramartial affair. I greatly enjoyed this author's first book, ""In the Shadows of the Moonglade"" and looked forward to his subsequent book to see of he could at least equal his previous work. Well, he has not only equalled it, he has surpassed it and proven that he's an author to taken seriously."
1,Not worth the effort to pick it up,"BRILLIANT? Where did that come from? It honestly makes me wonder if all the reviews here were done by friends or the author himself. I have to say that I struggled through this book after having read a GREAT book, Jonathan Kellerman's BILLY STRAIGHT. To me, this book was a wrong turn down a reading DEAD END. Okay, to be fair, I must explain that 1) the characters were cardboard cutouts, 2) the suspense did not show up at all, and 3) the writer's mastery of good descriptive words is non-existent. I wish this book would have come with a warning label for amature writing."
5,Love this Book!,"This is a great, informative book! I have almost worn it out! Author is ""spot on"" with his information and it has helped us a great deal in choosing our campsites."
1,NOT A GERBER,This is a good knife and descent quality but it is not a Gerber. Amazon should know better then to lie to customers.
1,One star too many...,I am so frustated! This is NOT a Gerber! My wife bought it for a Christmas gift and was so excited as she knows that Gerber makes quality tools. Had I been buying it I would have seen that it was nothing more than a cheap knock-off. This is made in CHINA. Need I say more? This is false advertisement using Gerber's good name and reputation to sell cheap ****! I am going to see if there is a way to report this to Amazon. DO NOT BUY!I gave it one star because the computer will not allow me to give it less. It's plainly one star too many.
1,Name is Misleading.. Not a Gerber!,"Haven't used the tool yet, but as soon as I received the item I noticed it was not a Gerber. Gerber is a name brand Version! This is a Chinese Knock Off."
1,Misleading name,"I bought two of these knives as gifts, because of the misleading ""Gerber"" title. They are actually Chinese-made Superknife brand. I am returning them immediately for a refund."
3,Average quality,"The tool its self actually has a nice feel to it, feels solid. the rubberized handles are comfortable in the hands, definitely doesn't feel like they're going to slip. I wouldn't use them for heavy duty work, but for something quick I'm sure it'd be just fine. My only disappointment was the included screw/hex bits. it comes with an adapter that attaches to the phillips head screwdriver flip out on the handle, the bits then fit into the adaptor. They cheaped out and put in a little magnet encased in cheap plastic inside the metal adapter which barely can hold itself on to the screwdriver head and the bit at the same time. So if youre considering the value of having the extra bits don't as they're not really useful. Compare it as just multi-tool to multi-tool and buy appropriately. Gramps loves it though just for the tool and the case it comes with that fits on his belt."
3,SuperKnife,"The Gerber Superknife is a very functional multitool that allows me to get the job done. I completely disassembled a garbage disposal the other day without needing any other tools. It is a bit large which made it difficult to fit in the tight places underneath the sink. Also its a tad heavy, but for the price it is pretty sweet. Also the bit set that it comes with is phenomenal."
1,Not a Gerber,"Not sure how this can be continued to be listed as a Gerber, when it isn't. Packaging/Branding gave no indication that this product was a Gerber."
5,The Woven Path- a great pick!,"The suspense, mystery, and wonder in this book are those which will thrill all. Dangerous spies, talking toys, a boy who is tangled up with destiny, souls, spirits, and demons all come together in this marvelous read. Who has been commiting all these crimes? How does Germany know the exact night to attack? How did Neil get thrown into the past, together with a talking toy? Who are the three women? An intriguing read-one which will not be forgotten soon."
3,Bought it for a friend.,I didn't really read it. I bought it for a friend and leafed through some of it. It may have not been right timing for me but my friend likes it.
1,Terrible Quality,"These Shoes are beautiful and soft as a glove, i only could wear the 4 times, they just fell apart on my feet.I have already repair the 4 times, so i have been paying more to the shoemaker than what the shoes cost me."
4,slow starter--good finisher,"I thought Megamind was a super slow starter. I almost turned it off--but my kids had said it was such a wonderful flick, and the reviews were good. So I persevered. It had a nice finish--quite enjoyable. I only wish they would have moved the beginning along faster in order to get to the ""good stuff."""
5,Love love love,We absolutely LOVED this movie... it was by far one of the funniest movies we have seen and everyone in my family can watch it over and over PLUS the sound track was AWESOME. This movie is tons of fun and laughs.... i was soooo happy to buy this movie!!!!!
2,"I'm sure the movie is great, but the quality was horrible.","I didn't give this a bad rating because of the movie itself. It looked like a pretty good one, and was looking forward to watching it as a family. However, the quality of Amazon's movie rental services through our Playstation 3 has really gone downhill. We used to rent movies all the time through Amazon, but not anymore. We couldn't get through 2 minutes of the movie without it buffering or pausing and saying it wouldn't work. I would say it was our internet connection, but we haven't changed plans, and we are still able to play movies and shows very well through Netflix. I am disappointed that I paid money to rent Megamind but never got to watch it!"
2,Lack of features,"this movie it seems like from germany or France, it does not come with features like subtitles options and languages,Carlos"
5,Gift,This is ment to be a gift. I know that the person receiving this gift will be very happy with it.
2,No wonder I don't remember this movie,"Dull, dull, dull. Boring. Me, my wife and my 5 year old all started doing something else about halfway through."
4,Fun for all,We love this movie along with our 5 & 2 yr old boys. We reinterate that it doesn't pay to be bad and it can be very lonely even if you have everything you ever wanted.
3,Not for me.,"It was okay, but kinda boring and very long and drawn out. Tried to put the usual good versus bad in it, but they also seemed to try and build on beginning to much. About half way through I switched to another movie."
2,"Will Ferrel and Tina Fey are good, but not riveting",Ummmm disappointing. The script does not grab you. Although unique it's a sleeper. Will and Tina are the only thing that got us half way through. It's not good :(
5,Cant get enough!,"This is an awesome movie, great for the adults too! my girls love watching this over and over! it's one of the best!!"
5,Very Funny,"With a great cast and remarkable animation, this movie was hilarious. The eye movements of the characters had me laughing as much as the dialogue. Great movie!"
5,Megamind,It is the greatest movie I've ever seen. It is funny has plenty of action and just a splash of romance.I loved it!
3,Loved the concept but the execution is flawed,Megamind is a fun and silly experience. This is pure fun and I love the concept of what happens when the super villain actually wins. The downfall is that it can lead to a labored and boring plot which lacks focus and can seem tedious and boring. The great flaw in this movie is that it is too mopey and doesn't have the wry humor of a Toy Story or makes us see more about our self like Wall-E does. Megamind ranks more like a half baked romantic comedy then a wired over the topI also think this movie could have benefited more from Will Ferrall's edgy brand of humor. He was so muted here as to be almost invisible. The obtuseness of Megamind was funny for a while but it went dry very quickly. I think this is a cute movie but I have to say I think it could have been funnier.
3,This movie has one fatal flaw!,"Megamind (Single-Disc Edition)I love animation and cant wait for new ones to check out! I really want to like them all.Megamind, I found, has great animation, but forgot one very important factor that any goodanimation always delivers; You have to like the characters; and there was nothing reallylikeable about any of these characters!The main superhero is all about ego. The woman reporter is a cardboard cliche. The villianthat Megamind creates is a total jerk. Megamind's minion can only be described as weird,-and the homage to ""Robot Monster"" doesn't work. That leaves Megamind himself to relate to,-and I cant! At the end of the movie, he is still totally egotistical and self indulgent.All of the plot twists did not help to warm up to him and his changes of heart seem superfluous.I doubt I will ever watch this movie again because I just don't care about the characters. I findthat I watch ""Despicable Me"" over and over because it delivers everywhere Megamind fails."
3,"ok, could have been great",As a married man without kids I love this genre. With the voice talent and original premise this movie could have been up there with the Incredibles but instead it stumbles along with awkward pacing and little to no laughs.I found myself amused and laughed out loud a small handful of times but there were only two moments in the entire film that really got us all laughing.This feels like the newest Alice in Wonderland in that it has all the ingredients of an instant classic yet somehow it fails to grab you and will be quickly forgotten.
2,Disappointed,Did not like this movie at all. Just didn't have the pizazz of other cartoons. Was far more juvenile than expected. Awful story line.
3,Wouldn't give it a second thought,Once it's over it's forgettable. This movie didn't have the humor we were expecting or characters that were endearing. It's just ok if you want to see it but if we hadn't seen it we would not have missed anything.
3,"Great movie, cheap packaging","Our 12 year old loves the movie, but the packaging is done on the cheap side -- no liner notes, although there is a tab for it, and the movie dvd has only the title printed on it in silver."
2,Did not make the cut,"Just did not seem to capture my children or me. Some of the music was a lousy pick. It could have really been good, but they must have let warped minds in to put it together. Very easy to forget about it once you have made it through it. Maybe they should have watched Tangled to find out what a good movie for the family is."
2,Not as clever as I'd hoped,"I was disappointed in this film. Because I loved Monsters and Aliens and Despicable Me, I expected better of this one."
2,Droll Drivel,"Cute graphics, but not even entertaining to a 12 year old. I just couldn't get though it either. Lacking any type of recognizable humor. Since humor is subjective, I'm sure that there is a select group that will find this absolutely hilarious, but not a group that you would want as neighbors."
5,S.M.J's review,"I must admit i'm 39 years old, and i love this movie. I have no problem watching it with my three year old however many times as he wants to watch it. I know megamind is supposed to be the bad guy but i was rooting for him from the beginning. I found megamind to be the most likable character in the movie in fact i find him completely loveable. This was a very funny movie with a great message and amazing music."
5,I loved this movie,"Everything from the animation to the plot to the moral behind the story - it was all great. Funny, touching, cute, I would have liked to have seen this more than once at the theaters. It was my favorite kids' movie of the year, hands down."
5,Great Movie for Family,We love this movie; I have girls ages 5 and 8. I think it is well done and also witty enough to keep the adults entertained. Saw it in the theater and then wanted it to watch at home.
3,meh,I'm a will ferrell fan and this was OK but not one of his best. Could take it or leave it. Would rather have seen it on tv rather than having paid for it.
5,Love it,Great shape. This movie is hilarious. I recommend it for anyone - adult or child. Will Farrell does a great job being a dorky villain.
5,Megamind digital copy,This product was available with instant delivery and can be downloaded to a diffferent device. Megamind is a very funny movie.
5,MEGAMIND,"Read great reviews about the movie and wasn't disappointed. Recommended viewing for all ages, great in 3D would love to enjoy other similar movies."
5,Awesome Movie,A great movie to own and watch over and over again. Because of the fact that this movie is funny from start to finish and fun for the whole family.
4,Funny,"I'll keep this short, but my family really enjoyed Megamind. The characters were pretty cool, the story pretty funny, and the concept fairly novel. Your kids will enjoy it, and so will your adults. If anything was out of place or subpar, it was Jonah Hill's character, but i think that was an intentional decision by the producers."
2,Thankful it works..,"I'm happy that it came so fast, but the box looks like it got in a fight with a dog or thrown around a lot and the DVD...I'm happy it works but I can honestly find better quality at a swap meat, it had soo many scratches on it, some pretty deep btw, that I was worried it would work.This was NOT worth the $10 i paid for. But I thankfully know a place were they can get rid of scratches for a fair price, but I honestly should have to do that for ""Condition: Used - Very Good"" don't lie to your customers..."
4,Good Engaging Story,Good to watch on a plane. The story was different and it kept my interest the entire time. Excellent animation as well.
3,A little disapointed.,This movie start real slow. I almost got up to go to something else and let the kids watch it. It did pick up and was ok by the end but it is not something I think we would buy to watch again and again.
4,A fun and very funny film,"One of the best animated films of the year, it looks great, is romantic, has good action and it's very funny."
5,We loved it!,This is a great movie and teachable moment for children in regard to who can save the day! Love it.
4,Hilarious,"Will Farrell's movies are generally not family-friendly, but Elf and this one are VERY FUNNY and SAFE for the entire family. Voice talents are great throughout (Ferrell is superb), plot is unique, as are the characters. We laugh all the way through this one even after seeing it 4 times. My kids (16 and 13) quote it often."
4,Excellent story,"This film was made many years ago. The production techniques are dated but the story is excellent. It is a portrayal of the times of the inquisition. The characters are well done. The message is pertinent today for various reasons. First, the Gospel is never out of date. Second, the dominance of an authoritative religion (in this case the Roman Catholic Church) over a country warns us today about the dangers of Muslim Sharia law gaining prominance in the USA."
4,Loved it....,"Hadn't seen this movie in several years so decided to watch again. Glad I did, really enjoyed it. Definitely was a good choice for today. Remains in my list of 'go-to' movies when not sure what to watch."
4,I've always like this movie,I had not seen it for a few years and decided to watch it again. I think I was a teenager when I first saw the move and it was still good as an adult. Nice story about the love of two sisters who are best friends and would do anything for each other.
4,THE BAD GIRL,"this one is about two girls who at science develop some kind of stuff. They take it home with them and as a joke they put some of it in the mouth of a dead frog, to their surprise it comes to life again. Now they accidentally hit a girl and put the stuff in her mouth too, of course she comes back to life too but maybe they should've thought twice before doing that. Story was really well written, the idea seemed kind of stupid to me at first but it turned out to be a real frightening story and it made you feel like you were there with them. It also had a very good ending."
5,Great Ending!,"This book is about two best friends who really dont like science but once Jan, Dawn's friend mixes some chemicals and makes a formula that brings dead things to life science doesnt seem so bad after all"
4,Girl Power,"This book is about two teens, Jan and Dawn, and their rival, Cindy. Jan mixes up some chemicals, and makes a potion. Then , it brings things from the dead back to life! First, a frog, a dog, and then a human. It is a good book of how a girl copes with a psycho killer on the loose."
2,The Bad Girl is a Pretty Bad Book!,"Fear Street has always held me captive with it's tales of normal teenagers mixed up in terrifying situations.I never thought I would dislike a Fear Street story, but I really am NOT KEEN on this one.I can almost believe in the tales of ghosts and psychos.But this one is just ridiculous.I couldn't wait for it to be over.It is about 2 teen girls who discover the formula to bring living beings back to life.The person or animal who was previously dead is now a monster and eventually explodes!!!!!!If this had been my first experience of Fear Street I would never have read the other books!It's kind of suspenseful but mostly not the one I would recommend."
5,"Great Book, GO Get It.","This book was one of the most surprising books I've read. It was a page-turner. The ending left me with my jaw hanging. If you like surprises and suspense, read this book."
3,Hmmmm...,"I ordered 3 different styles of these inexpensive, silver, moon/star rings. They are cute, but they turned my finger greenish the first time i wore them. I never had this happen with Sterling, so i'm not sure what to feel about them. They're still cute rings."
3,Great for practice and beginners.,"This is a great scarf if you're a beginner like me. I didn't want to invest in a $40 scarf at the time, so this was the perfect substitute. It definitely gets the job done. The material is a bit delicate, so be careful not to tear or scratch it."
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited when I ordered this... that is until I opened the box. I ordered size XS. Not only was it short, the sleeves were short too, and it was very boxy like a man's jacket. Not suited for a slim woman's body. It had a small hole and no tags attached leading me to believe it was possibly used or previously returned. The jacket looked cheap which just goes to show that you get what you pay for. I sent it back immediately."
3,Not for me,"First this jacket is very well made. However this jacket is not for me. I had to return because of the weight, and the jacket is really made for a person that is flat chested also I am short and this jacket came above my waist. When a jacket is labled as short it always fits to my waist but in this case it is as advertised."
5,Always loved Bernie,"Bernstein is a ""classic"" composer, conductor, and musician. The, and other seriesw of him, completes my collection. Interesting: he was as big in life as he is in death."
5,Bernstein at his best!,Nobody makes a better introduction to the world of music than Leonard Bernstein! Only english language and subtitles.
3,"Fairly general, a good start for undergraduate level","As a finite element software developer, I find this book is so designed that it is relatively easy to understand by any level of graduate student. The first few chapters on 1-dimensional finite element equation formulation is the best I have ever seen so far in the ""sea"" of finite element text. Other than that, the overall content of the book is rather ""light"". It should be read by all users who use finite element."
5,Shadows-she falls into your dreams,"Asrai is:Margriet Mol - VocalsMartin Kooy - BassManon van der Hidde - Synth - ViolinKarin Mol - DrumsRik Janssen - GuitarI always enjoy Asrai's music. The vocals, synthesizers, and lyrics create a heavy and intense mood to each song. Margriet Mol has a powerful voice.She reminds me just a little of Doro Pesch (from Warlock, another one of my favorite classic 80's vocalists). Each song on Touch Of the Dark is good.Restless, Touch in the Dark,Tower, and Shadows are stand out songs. Tower is a mesmerizing ballad.This is a five star product"
4,Pretty good CD.,"I had heard Asrai about 6 months ago, and was unfortunately turned off by them at first because the vocals in their first song were a bit pitchy and didnt sound too great over the computer. Just a few days ago, I came across the CD for only 3 dollars! So I figured I'd give it another chance being that it was only three dollars. I found out my first impression was definitely wrong. The CD is really great and ended up being better than the other CD I purchased along with it!! The singer's vocals also are a lot better sounding in the other songs, so it isnt a problem if you are dreading what I said earlier. Great CD overall."
3,Sounds like,This is an awesome combo. I'd say Tori Amos like vocal stylings coupled with rockin' metal
4,Very versatile and great color in the room,"I bought 2 of these ottomans after seeing a friend who had some similar ones she bought at another store for $50 each. She needed some versatile furniture that was somewhat soft and safe for her baby. We have a baby who is learning to pull up on things and she had bonked her head a couple of times on the coffee table. These were great! They are firm foam cubes that can be used as ottomans, TV trays, or push them together for an impromptu coffee table. We ended up ordering 2 more. For this price they can't be beat, and the free ground shipping was awesome! My only compaint is that they are a very lightweight so they tip easily. But for $24.99 what can you expect? Cleanup is also a breeze. We just wipe them down with a damp cloth and let them air dry. We make a little half circle out of them and let my daughter cruise around the living room with no worries of falling and getting a knot on her head."
2,Beech paddles,"The product is well made, but the paddles are somewhat small. However returning it to the company has been quite a hassle."
4,great fun,"i've been doing this workout for a couple months. i like that it's only 30 minutes for 2 miles worth of walking. after a month, i turned off the sound and use my own music/headset, that way, i never get bored."
5,A great 30-minute workout,"I've tried a few of Leslie's workouts, and so far this one is my favorite (I also own her Walk/Jog CD, which is great, and I've rented a couple of her other videos through my local library). This video involves the use of hand weights in intervals, so I get some strength training at the same time as my aerobic workout. I also like that Leslie's workouts are easy to follow and don't involve a lot of complicated moves. This workout is easy to understand and follow and can be adjusted to different intensity levels (by using larger/smaller movements and by using larger/smaller weights) to meet my own individual exercise needs."
2,didn't work out for me,"the people are annoying in the video. I felt like weights were added on too swiftly, and they are used too much for this to be a walking video. Ugh."
1,Leslie Sanson DVD never received,I never received the DVD I ordered over a month ago. Amazon did give me a refund.
4,Excellent workout!,"I love this workout, as long as I can do more listening than watching! My first video was the original walk away the pounds and I loved the background people. On this one, they are not cheery, they are boring, and look like thier time is totally being wasted. Since I am still in the need of losing about 35 more lbs, I can ignore them for now. Sandy is entertaining to watch though if you need a good laugh."
4,"Watch your knees, please!","I have been a fan of Leslie's for years, and she has helped me stay in decent shape for the amount of time I'm willing to put into it. Every Winter, when I start feeling like a big slug, I order another one of her routines! This year I decided to add strength training to my walk, and this work-out is a winner. The only problem I feel I must warn other Boomers about is the strain it may put on your knees. The weight training intervals are made up entirely of squats and lunges. Normally, I only have occasional minor knee pain, but I can only make it half way through the strength segments of the workout before I'm afraid it will do some damage, and have to finish it walking in place while I do the weights. I'm going to stick with it, and try to ""work through it"", as they say, but I don't recommend it to anyone who already has knee issues. Squats and lunges are not your friends! Keep on walking!"
5,Outstanding,"All of Leslie's programs are so easy to do, yet challenging enough to where you do work up a sweat. I have several of her DVds and I mix up what I do dependng on how I feel each day. And yes, I've seen results. My legs are stronger, I see more defiition in my middle and best of all, the scale has gone down. If you combine this program with a solid diet, you'll lose weight -- I lose on average 1.5 to 2 lbs. per week by combining this program 3x a week with a good diet."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting.,"I have had this DVD before, but this one was somewhat different. I don't know if there are two DVDs with the same name."
3,A good way to get into fitness,"Lesley Sansone's DVDs are a good way to get someone who has not done any fitness for some time off their bum and moving. I found her a little ""saccharine"" and the work outs not challenging enough for me - but I've had friends lose loads of inches and even some weight from consistent use."
4,work those legs!,"This is a great quick workout. It's 3-minute intervals of cardio and muscle work. I counted 160 squats in this video so it's a great leg workout! I started with 3-lb weights and increased to 5-lb weights, but I think it's a good workout without any weights at all. I recommend it!"
3,First Walk away the pounds Workout I didn't like,"I have worked my way through a few of Leslies workouts and I am pretty happy.I have walk and Kick, walk and Job, 1 mile, 2 mile workoutsSo I bought walk strong because I wanted to work on strength training. This was OK. I am heavier and it bothered me that all of the leg work was lunges (not sure what the alternatives were, but wasn't happy). I ended up doing mostly just the arms and then the walking work out. I don't feel like I got the same level of work out as any of the other work outs.I have been using weight during the one mile walk and I love that.Anway, thought I needed to show a different point of view."
5,She nails it again!,"I love this video. It is only 30 minutes, which is more than enough to avoid getting bored or overworked. The choreography is very easy to follow, but you definitely get a work out in all areas of your body (You will feel it the next day) and work up a nice sweat. I love doing her videos on rainy days when I can't get outside or when I don't have enough time to go to the gym. I have purchased so many other videos that are so difficult to follow, which is why I love Leslie's videos."
2,The Jamboree,"I enjoy Vicki Lawrence, but the creators should have stuck to the orignal cast. The original Sister Mary Paul was very, very, funny. Sister Mary Regina's ""cameo"" appearance just wasn't enough. Though all the actors and actresses were great, they could never ""fill the shoes"" of the original cast. If you are a Nunsense fan, I don't advise purchasing ""Jamboree"", as it was a real disappointment, compared with Nunsense 1 and 2."
3,nunsense 3,we did not care for this movie. tha dvd was ok the change of story line and actors would not hold a candle to the first two.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,We LOVE Nunsense I and II and looked forward to watching this DVD. Worse spent 90 minutes of my life. The original cast is far more talented and funny. Don't waste your money or time on this DVD.
2,unreliable seller,"I ordered this product from Amazon. I'm from the Philippines, so I had it delivered to my relative and she shipped it to me. I thought I ordered the complete set as it states. I was dismayed that this set that I bought does not include the shower valve. How can you sell this without the shower valve. Even if I saved $27, now I have to spend $82 more to order the shower valve."
4,Awesome quick reference,"I have been using webex for training my students online, but always used only basic functionalites. I always thought myself as smart enough for what I need to do online. One of my friend was reading it and I just skimmed through. Found interesting and bought a copy. Trust me...""Reading this dummies book will make you an expert in webex""."
1,"Typical ""for Dummies"" Pap","I purchased this book because I was scheduled to do online training through WebEx. This book was absolutely no help at all. It essentially gave a brief exposure to the WebEx system and interface and then filled the rest of the pages with a bunch of nothing.This is typical of every ""for Dummies"" book I have seen. My recommendation for anyone planning on using WebEx as a trainer or a student: Don't waste your time or money on this book. You'll do far better downloading WebEx' online training resources.The only reason I bought this book was that it is the only book on WebEx I could find. I just wish someone had warned me not to waste my money as I am warning you."
2,This book is REALLY for dummies,"Webex is a fantastic tool, to be sure. But this book is a waste of time. The online learning tools at webex.com are a lot better that this book. It reads more like an ad for the product that a useful reference guide. The product is so easy to use that this book is really unnecessary.Now, if you REALLY are a dummy, this book might be helpful to you in some ways (so I gave it 2 stars). But I'd recommend you use the online tutorials at Webex, or join one of their online live meetings."
5,Very Resourceful Book,"Kanagy's ""Living Abroad in Japan"" covers just about everything you need to know to do just that and is generally geared towards those interested in staying for a longer period than just a week's vacation.Kanagy covers a brief introduction to the country before laying out such topics as VISA explanations, taxes, finding a place to live, transportation, and what to expect in daily life. It also includes several sections devoted to specific regions and an extensive list of contact information for everything from real estate offices to healthcare providers to internet service providers.While the book was published in 2004, much of the information is still accurate and applicable. For example, Kanagy uses 1 dollar = 110 yen to estimate costs and, as of writing this review, her estimate is not far from the present 1:120."
4,Luminous Impressions of the Great Masters,"A fascinating study of the careers of some of the most celebrated artists of all-time and the daring impressionistic style they pioneered. Any fan of these great artists, and there certainly are lots of them, would be entertained by this informative documentary which peels back the layers of these luminaries to explore what made them such magnificent artists. I highly recommend this to any art-lover."
3,Get on with it....,"The best sequence in this video is prior to the band's playing of The Cage. Phil is being silly and foolish with the crowd when someone yells out loud ""PLAY THE BLOODY CAGE"". This guy must have been as frustrated as I was hearing all the sappy stuff waiting to hear The Cage. They finally play it and it does not disappoint- this is the best version of this song live. It is hard to believe it is the same band that does the other sappy stuff. That's All !"
4,Good supplementary text for introductory statistics course,"This book allows the reader to access the data analysis power of Microsoft Excel 97. It covers all of the functions located in the Data Analysis add-in for Excel (Tools Menu). Examples are explicit, step-by-step, and business related. Little previous knowledge of Excel required- there are 2 chapters dealing with the basics of using the program. This is not a stand-alone text, however, and should accompany a comprehensive introductory statistics text for those with no previous statistics experience."
5,Good teaching of formulas in excel,"I got the book several years ago with a 3 1/2 floppy disk. Its a goo d book on how to use formulas and handle data with excel, very practical and concise. Should be updated."
4,Data Analysis Using Excel,"This textbook is very good for those students and the like to get a better understanding of rules and techniques of data analysis using excel in the easiest way possible. Although the book offers just the basics, it does teach you how to go from there to the advanced analysis."
3,I'm not a big anthology fan.....,"...however, I am a huge fan of both Susan Johnson and Stephanie Laurens, so I figured I'd give this book a try. Insomuch as a story of this length can be captivating, then these stories were. They were all very well written and packed with a lot of spice. If you need a book to read in shorts spurts, as is the case on vacation on the beach....then this book is perfect. I do not read much in the way of contempary romance, so I had not been exposed to either Dee Holms or Eilene Wilks before this book, but I liked their style and stories as well. The book is definitely worth reading, though I still prefer to read the full length novels."
3,Not for beginners,"I disagree with the editorial review's claim that no experience is required. While it is good at explaining the pros and cons of various types of welding equipment, it is mostly a craft project book. Setting up an oxy-acetylene torch with was a little intimidating for me,and this book was not helpful for that."
1,It does not hold up to the title,This book is not even close to be what the title suggests. There are just a few pages devoted to a very basic review of the various methods of welding. The rest of the book is about building projects based on welding techniques that are not explained in the book.
1,Welding for Arts and Crafts,I was very dissatisfied with this book. I was expecting a book that explained the idea of and how to do Arts and Crafts by welding. It gave very little information about which welder might be best and then a bunch of old outdated projects. I found this book mostly usless.
2,Not worth $30,"I picked up this book as a present for my brother, who has made some simple lawn art (dogs, frogs etc) while learning to weld. I wasn't expecting instructions (which this book doesn't really provide), but rather inspiration/concepts to checkout. So, I was quite disappointed when I opened the package and saw a small magazine style ""book"". The pictures are very poor - they are black and white with really terrible shading, so you cannot see hardly any detail. When I say poor, I mean you can see the individual pixels on the pictures without even looking close.While this book may have value if it is priced more appropriate to the printing quality, $10 or less, it doesn't have enough information to justify the $30 price tag."
2,Dazed and Confused,"The book had a lot of ideas for garden art, which I enjoyed, but each project uses a different welding technique and different types of welding tools. A person would have to invest a lot of money into all these various tools in order to build the pieces of garden art the book suggests. Which is highly inpractical. So even though I enjoyed seeing the garden art, it would be impossible to construct it the way the author suggests, unless a person had an entire shop of welding tools to use."
5,What fun!,"I ran into this CD on my library website and ordered it. What a treasure! My [...] year old dd absolutely loves this CD. Jill Trinka really captures the essence and charm of American folk music. In the process, she really hooks kids. John Feierabend is a wonderful educator. I would love to be in his class. This CD is first rate."
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!,"This ""book"" is just a reprint (actually, it looks like a poor Xerox of a newspaper item, miniaturized) of a book from 1860, and each page contains a single column of print, so small (I would estimate about 8 point) and blurred that it would be almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass, and would still be difficult. Each page contains the central type, appearing as a newspaper column, in the center of the page, with large white spacing all around the page. It cannot be described without seeing it, and I've already rewrapped it for return and do not want to unwrap it just to take a picture to enclose with this review. As you might imagine, I did not read it (I couldn't); I just flipped through it, gasped, and immediately went to my browser to print a return label before I accidentally threw away the box it came in.However, if you're a masochist ..."
1,Selective Skepticism?,"I never fail to be fascinated by the ease with which people of traditional religious faiths manifest Hypocracy. Ms. Lindskoog is obviously such a person. Her book on frauds and ""malarkey"" might have been believable if she wasn't Judeo-Christocentric and previously employed by a Seminary. You can't attack ""fraud and malarkey,"" when you yourself are a believer in things which cannot be proven by Science. If you live in a glass house, you shouldn't throw stones."
1,do not buy,"I cut the radio up to listen to my music. After 2 min something in back of the sysetem blew up! and started smoking...The whole system shut down and made a loud buzzing noise, and the system would not cut back on. Now on top of all of that my damn CDs is stuck inside this radio system. I had to break the damn syetem in half in order to get my cds out! You get what you pay for."
4,very helpful for my daughter who is learning to hold her pencil,"I was getting a bit frustrated trying to teach my daughter (age 5) the proper pencil hold. She was getting frustrated, too, to the point that she didn't want to draw or write anymore. These triangular pencils really helped!!! Try them!!"
3,"Make use of failure, since it's inevitable anyway!","We get to know ourselves through our failures as well as our successes, and these learning experiences can be honored rather than avoided with shame. Chapters cover the failure of love, happiness, success, philosophy, plans, security, meaning, enlightenment, ego, God, and death, and even the ""failure"" of failure if one doesn't fail ""consciously"" and productively incorporate the lessons of unsatisfactory experiences. These experiences, the author believes, throw you back on yourself and God (or Truth).David Whyte's essays cover much of the same ground more thoughtfully and elegantly (see ""The Heart Aroused,"" for example). ""The Way of Failure"" is fairly repetitive and one-note in comparison, but the idea that we will all fail along the way and that we can make use of it is a good one to remember in our consumerist, ego-driven society."
2,Cute idea but not functional,You carry all your items on your belt . After use you put the items back in the belt. The belt gets greesy and dirty and its hard to clean.
4,Give it a chance,"It took me a few tries to get into this book - for some reason the beginning is written in cringe-worthy flowery prose, littered with stilted similes.Once the author gets down to the business of story-telling, though, this book became one I couldn't put down. The characters are engaging, the dialogue is believable, and the details are really convincing. The plot isn't terribly complicated, although there are a few surprises, but overall the book is well-done and entertaining, if you can just get through the first couple of chapters."
4,Great book but a bit slow.,"This is a really great book. I picked it up at a flea market because the cover said ""For fans of Robin McKinley"", which I am. The world ""First Truth"" is set with strongly defined cultures, the characters are extremely well developed, and I love the little kestrel side kick. (Sometimes I wanted to yell at Alissa for being so stubborn and foolish. Thank goodness Strell is there to balance her out.) I gave the book 4 stars because it had the potential to be more exciting in the action department. I mean, it even has mysterious raku in it! (I'll won't say what a raku is; I'll let it be a surprise.) Honestly, it's book length but really felt like the pace of the plot was supposed to pick up then it never did then it suddenly ended mid-story. I immediately ordered rest of the series on Amazon. I can't wait for my used books to arrive. I want to know what happens next!"
5,Most wonderful,"Finished of the fourth book of a series today (in German).I love Fantasy novels, especially the good ones.I don't know how these are in original.But when the translation's already great, the original can only be better.One day, when amazon is nice to us again, I will order them in English.I will not write a review with detailed information about what's going on in the story. I bet a gazillion people already did that.I just tell you that much: I loved it and it's a very different Fantasy story from what we usually get to read."
5,one of the best,"I went into a bookstore one day looking for new fantasy to read, and I saw a table set up with the first two books of this series. I had Dawn Cook to sign them, and that was my main reason for buying them at the time. Later, I started reading First Truth and realized I loved it. The characters come alive and there are so many intracacies that come together in each consecutive book. The first book introduces Lyssa's dilemma of having two potential love interests: Strell and Lodesh. The choice carries on through all four books, and you find it hard to choose a side as to which you hope she picks in the end. This is a great book, and I recommend this book along with the other three in the Truth set."
2,Mostly junk,"You've got 20 year olds acting like 14 year olds, an insane albino, and a dragon who can't be bothered. Unforgettable only because you can't believe the author took what could have been a great idea and wrecked it so badly."
1,1st truth,"unable to give a review due to the fact that I never recieved the book. I finally got my money back from the vendor. If the book is anything like like whatever else this author has written, then I'm sure it is wonderful....I am planning on ordering it again from another vendor."
1,Flimsy Toering,I was really excited to get this ring. I have been wanting a celtic toering that wasn't cheap looking for a long time. I had it on for one day and it broke in half. I spent way too much money for a toering to break that easily. Very disappointed.
4,4 STARS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THEIR CAREER,"I'VE LOVED THE OFFSPRING SINCE DAY ONE AND THE SONGS HERE ARE GREAT. BUT LIKE MOST PEOPLE, IT'S THE SONGS NOT ON HERE THAT ARE MY FAVORITES. I HATE OVERPLAYED SINGLES. ANYWAY, I REALLY HOPE THAT NOW EPITAPH WILL COME OUT WITH A GREATEST HITS OF THE FIRST HALF OF THEIR CAREER. IGNITION, I THOUGHT, WAS THEIR GREATEST RECORD. AND YOU WILL GET MORE GOOD STUFF FROM SMASH. SO GET THIS IF YOUR A NEW COMER, IF YOUR NOT, IGNITION AND IXNAY WILL DO YOU FINE."
5,I could have made my own...,"I only got this CD for the new song. Dont you just hate that, I could have made my own greatest hits cd with some extra songs I like on there but no, you have to buy the whole CD just for 1 damn song!"
1,Dualdisc sucks! Don't buy the dualdisc version!,"This Offspring album is great, lots of great music. But I unknowingly bought the dualdisc version and when I tried to play it in my 101-disc CD player at home, it locked up the player and the carousel won't even move! What a nighmare!"
1,CD side doesn't play,The Dual Disc idea is awesome except the cd side doesn't conform to normal cd standards and there fore doesn't work in any of my cd players except 1. However the DVD side works just fine. What a waste. I can't even put this CD on my Mp3 player for snowboarding. Oh well I guess I will have to illegally download the songs that I payed for so that I can listen to them.
1,bad,"this cd for some reason has horrible sound, something isnt right about this cd, quality is crap...do not buy. Product is possible fraud, i turned cd in to an expert to find out."
3,Obviously missing some songs,"I gave it 3 stars for being too short (songs average 2:15) and missing some radio/video songs like other reviewers said ('I Choose'-personal favorite performed by one of my bands, and 'Meaning of life' and they should of added 'Mota' for being a greatest HIT). All these bad reviews should go to there website and maybe they'll eventually release a bigger compilation or box set. New song is good but sounds rehashed. Only good for casual fans. diehard fans buy version w/ dvd."
5,Este album no me podia faltar.,Tengo todos los albumes de The Offspring y no me podia quedar sin la mejor compilacion de exitos y menos en esta presentacion dual-disc. Suena espectacular en mi teatro casero. Les recomiendo colocarlo en el dvd player con teatro casero y audio 5.1 sencillamente espectacular. Me revivio todos los momentos del pasado concierto de offspring en Bogota Colombia el 29 de octubre de 2004.
4,Cuando se esta arriba nadie se acuerda de los de abajo.,"en realidad pienso que es un gran cd recopilatorio pero considero que faltaron piesas como Jennifer Lost the War, Kill the President, Out on Patrol, I'll Be Waiting, Session, Kick Him When He's Down, Dirty Magic, No Hero, Forever and a Day, lo que me hace pensar que hubieron problemas entre las casas disqueras, lastima que por cuestiones legales un cd que pensé que iba hacer uno de los mejores recopilatorios, se haya quedado en un bueno y no excelente como adjetivo."
3,Where are the classics?,"Ok I know this is supposed to be their ""greatest hits"" so I can understand why they would leave off stuff from the self titled album...But for godsakes where the hell is Kick him when hes down, Dirty Magic, I choose, Pay the man, the total immortal cover and DUI.....To me thats great offspring, so do your self a favor and just buy ignition, smash, ixnay n americana n skip this, frankly anything after americana isnt really worth listening to.."
2,For RADIO Offspring fans ONLY!,"All these songs are from the radio. Now I got into The Offspring by listening to ""Why Don't You Get a Job?"" but once I started my Offspring CD collection I noticed that all the songs on the album were much better than what I heard on the radio. Like on the CD ""Americana"", I got sick of ""Why Don't You Get a Job?"" after listening to songs like ""She's Got Issues"", ""Feelings"", and especially ""Staring at the Sun"".In conclusion, i really feel that these are the wrong songs that portray The Offspring. I reccomend just getting CD's by the Offspring and Pass on this one. If you are a new fan to The Offspring then buy this but to the true fans you know what I'm talking about."
4,Super Decent! 4.5,"I got really into the Offspring over the summer and quick had to have a collection of their highlights. On this it delivered. This CD lived up to my expectations and I really do love it but for hardcore fans in need of a true definative collection, I can definately see how it's just not enough...anyway for the casual fan whose recently become obsessed, buy it. It probably has what you're looking for and more."
5,THIS CD ROCKS !!!,"This CD is not exactly a perfect comiplation, but it does come close. It does have all that hits that really matter except for Smash It Up (from the Batman Forever soundtrack) and Totalimmortal (from the Me, Myself & Irene soundtrack). I feel the edited radio versions of Why Don't You Get A Job and Original Prankster would have made much better additions to this collection than the uncensored album versions. You will hear a hidden bonus track after (Can't Get My)Head Aorund You. It's a great track. Why wasn't this track included as a second new track; that's what I want to know.Flaws aside, this really is a great CD. You have all the hits on one CD. Any CD with Self Esteem is a great CD!"
5,wow,If you like the offspring buy this album. All of their best songs are on it and it comes in dual disk which has a dvd too
4,...,"i dont care what others say, a greatest hits cd is the way to go; u can almost not go wrong with it. the offspring brings back my high school years."
4,Buy the Dualdisc!,"Bit surprised that an earlier reviewer said there was no difference between the CD and DVD sides of the Dualdisc.....The DVD contains a great set of 5.1 mixes of the songs. Hadn't bought an Offspring album since SMASH, but found I knew most tracks from the radio. GREAT IN SURROUND SOUND!"
4,Sehr gut!!!,"Hello guys, I gotta do this shop with amazon 'cause here in Colombia, SONY just bring the audio version and like I am an Offspring's fan I had to import this one. I am happy; It has so cool musik, and I missed ""She's got issues"" & ""Million miles away"" 'cause those ones are ""greatest hits"" too.I recomend u guys this cd, but not only for the musik, because if u have all the offspring's cds, well obviously u got all theirs songs (except the new one ""can't repeat""). The DVD side is so good too, and I thing that's the reason to buy this one DUAL DISC...Good bye! ¡Hasta luego pues!"
3,Hammerhead,This would have been a perfect hits album IF they added HAMMERHEAD!!!!!!!!!I cannot believe this song is not in it considering it was very mainstream song.
1,offspring,"im a verry big fan of the offspring and this albem gots a lot of great hits. but im very disapointed the music cd wont play in my cars cd player but plays fine in my home player, and the box says dual disk cd/dvd videos the dvd disk doesent have any videos on it it just plays their songs and shows a picture of the album that song was on. i was looking forward to seeing the video. if y like wasting your money on crap than by this album but y whould be better of buying some of their other great albums."
2,Crap!,I know their songs and I know which are the ones that are good and not. Haven't heard this album and I don't even tend to do so since the track listing sucks.Not a good greatest hits I'm afraid. Alot missing. So sad.
1,How do I become an Offspring fan?,"I tried banging my head against concrete and sniffing glue and noxious fumes to kill off the parts of my brain that was aware of bands like The Clash, The Sex Pistols, The Damned, and The Jam, but it still didn't work. What other ""punk"" bands do I need to destroy all memories of in order to finally appreciate The Offspring?"
5,Includes:,"""INCLUDES:* Chapter Lesson Plans that provide teaching strategies and activities* Correlation of all program resources[from the book of the front cover]"
4,Great Little Toe Ring...,I loved this toe ring. It was very comfortable to wear. I am using terms in the past tense because mine broke. That is mostly my fault because I can't sleep in mine. I had to take it on and off each day. This material is so soft and pliable that it easily broke. But if you plan to wear this all the time. I highly recommend this product. You will love it.
4,a small but expansive introduction to his work. great buy.,"i'll let the pics speak for themselves, other than to say this is some of the most original, moving and gruesome work i've ever seen - sometimes all three at once. if you're easily offended and/or expecting ""erotic"" nude photos, stick to the suicide girls. this is more like the work of dave mckean or bill sienkiewicz than that of avedon or elliott erwitt...but that's just my opinion (and they're both great; just not as bizzare.)"
4,Freaky Book,"This book is kind of freaky. I purchased it for the reason that it is freaky. I got it because I was born after the eras of carnival sideshows. It has a lot of disturbing images... well to most people I assume. This guy probably could have taken those pictures of aborted fetuses that people stand with on the corner. Yeah grotesque like that. One photograph is of a dead horse hoisted above someone with a huge erection next to their head. Keep an open mind if you want to get this book. As a side the photographic technique is excellent.Excellent gift for the goth high school girl. Or just to freak someone out, including yourself."
4,Terrific nostalgia,"I really enjoyed these two Edgar Bergen television specials from the 50's. Though technically only average as a ventriloquist, he is the funniest one ever. I'm a sucker for this kind of nostalgia, and I was not disappointed in these two shows. I'd love to see more.My only complaint is that the vendor put his logo on the bottom left of the screen -- not just initially or once in a while but for the entire duration."
3,ESSENTIAL DICTIONARY OF ORCHESTRATION,"Unless you are a genius, you could not possibly remember all that was taught in orchestration class. I had an instructor that said: knowledge is not the ability to know everything; knowledge is the ability to be able to find everything (in the literature). ESSENTIAL DICTIONARy... is one of those books in the literature."
5,"So small, but so huge!","The power of knowing the idiomatic properties of the entire Western orchestra, and then some... all located in a convenient spot in your pants!This is a powerful tool in any composers arsenal."
4,Easy to find the information you need,"This book is a great quick reference for anyone who composes music. Includes info on just about every instrument you can think of. Each listing has all the essential facts about the instrument, including written range, sounding range, and special characteristics. Well worth the six bucks."
5,A splendid addition to the kitchen cookbook shelf.,"In The Co-Op Cookbook, Rosemary Fifield (Education Director at the Co-op Food Stores in Hanover and Lebanon, New Hampshire) provides the health and budget conscious kitchen cook a compendium of tips for planning ahead, hints on using a kitchen more efficiently, directions for preparing and using fresh ingredients, ideas for substituting ingredients (including seasonal produce and grains), and an informative introduction to the principles of cooperative ownership. From Grampa's Saturday Night Kale, Asian Spicy Rice, and Sicilian Spirals, to Apple Harvest Chicken, Tarragon Surimi, and Cold Turkey Salad, Highly recommended for any family kitchen cookbook collection, The Co-Op Cookbook showcases recipes taken from traditional cuisines featuring Italian, Asian, and Mexican influences, adapted to please even the most discriminating palate. Virtually all of these mouth-watering main-dish recipes can be prepared in 30 minutes or less!"
3,Terrific addition to your kitchen,"The oil bottle is lovely with nice lines and a good stopper. Originally I though the plates were too small, but they are actually perfect. I keep the bottle beside the stove and use it daily. It has a great flow for the oil and the stopper is secure so you don't get oil dripping all over. Cleaning it is easier than I thought it would be. I had given this a three star rating when I first received it but I would give it five now. The system won't let me increase my rating though!"
4,Great for turning your computer in to a stereo,"I wanted something to improve the sound quality of music played off of my laptop and so I started searching for some 2.1 speakers. Found these on a great bargain at xpbargains.com from Office Depot.I have them set up in our TV ""room"" where they sit on either side of the TV and about 5 ft. from the computer. It is a great set up. Gives listening to music from the computer a stereo feel. One thing that would make it better is if the cords between the sub and the computer input were longer. It is just a 6 ft. cord and so I can't really stretch it much further.These are not THX certified and the satellite speakers are pretty small so the sound is okay, not great. But it can fill our large studio appartment, no problem.If the price is right, and it was for me (though 78 from Amazon seems little high) I recommend these whole heartedly. They take your computer to a whole new level."
1,Speakers broke after only one year!,We got these speakers as part of our new Dell system we purchased a little over a year ago. A few weeks ago we heard a crackle in the speakers and now they no longer work at all. I've read other reviews elsewhere concerning the same problem and apparently Creative won't recognize the pattern. Beware!
5,Reach for the sky.,"I first saw this film in London as a teenager in 1956. Douglas Bader's dogged determination to overcome his disability was an inspiration to me. Kenneth Moore did an outstanding job of portraying this gutsy Brit who never gave up, and served his country admirably in the time of her greatest need. Imagine, flying Spitfire and Hurricane fighters with two artificial legs. I have searched for this film for years, and I can't express my excitement when I found it on the Amazon website. Bader became a legend in his own time, and richly deserves the renewed recognition of his achievements that the reissue of this film brings."
3,"Great movie, poor picture quality......","While it's great to have this movie on DVD finally and in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, the picture quality suffers from being overly processed (scrubbed clean of grain and scratches) that has resulted in a cartoonish appearance in many scenes (not just the back projection scenes) and motion blurring (especially when there are sudden changes of direction) that is most distracting. This is a great film that deserves much better treatment.I suppose I'll have to wait years for a Blu-ray edition for a significant improvement. I hope VCI gives that project to Tiffany Beseau-Clayton as she did such marvelous work on VCI's A Christmas Carol, that Blu-ray is highly recommended."
4,reach for the sky,excellent movie story of douglas bader who despite the loss of both legs in an accident became a flying ace in the royal air force during the battle of britain. too bad it is not available to be playable in the united states.
1,REACH FOR THE SKY DVD,I returned this DVD to Amazon because it would not play. Amazon quickly sent areplacement but that DVD did not play. My guess is that there is a problem with the entirelot of this film. FYI this is the first and only DVD that I have purchased from Amazon thatwould not play out of hundreds purchased. Suggest you don't buy it.
4,"Reach for the Sky, is a great movie!","Kenneth More is great as "" never say die"" Douglas Bader! I'm a WWII history buff and have read extensively about flying Aces. Bader's story is one of courage and preservence. This is a Must See for those who love the genre."
3,Reach for the Sky,"Reach For The Sky is an uplifting story; which refreshingly has a basis in fact. It's good to present some stories inwhich the hero was a real person. The film provides the standard British staunch pride in country and strength of character. I think our younger people would do well to honor the moral fibre which this man presents. The story moves at a good pace and the film is in very good condition. All in all, a movie of value and a human being to be proud of having had amoungst us if only for a short time in the past."
2,Not my PAL,"I saw this movie on TCM a few weeks ago and wanted my own copy. What I got was a not so well made PAL (Phased Alternate Line)--what they use in Europe, conversion to NTSC (National Television Standards Committee)--what we use in the U.S.& Canada. Since this was a film originally I expected a film transfer to NTSC. That's not what I got. Why does this matter? The resolution is not crisp and when the camera pans left or right the video stutters. I played this in a new Blu-ray player. They shouldn't be able to market this as a factory original if it's simply a not so well made PAL conversion. There are conversions that would not suffer from these kinds of artifacts."
3,"It works, but not like I hoped for",I have seen other catalytic heaters that were extremely quiet when operating but didn't put out the BTUs that this one did. I hoped that this would be just as quiet. I have a Mr. Heater that puts out more heat but is noisy that works great for ice fishing and was hoping that this would do the trick for me when deer hunting. It seems to fall into the spot between the quiet but not warm enough heater and the noisy but warm one. It isn't quite hot enough for the ice fishing shack and is too noisy for hunting with a bow in Dec. around here. I don't see anything that is wrong with the heater but it just isn't what I was looking for.
3,Looks good but trying to conctact the manufacturer about strange corrosions in the back,"Haven't get a chance to try it yet but it looks fine from the outside. However, there were some white corrosions in the back of the unit. Trying to contact the manufacture to get a replacement before using."
2,To Small,"This heater is very small, I have to place it right at my feet to feel anything. Should have gotten a bigger one."
2,Space heater>,"I was very disappointed in this heater. I bought it to keep my van warm,or at least keep the chill off. The only thing the heater heated was the heater itself. Unless you sat right near it you could'nt feel any heat coming from it. Even a few feet away you could still see steam coming from your mouth. Even after being lit and running for a few hours,very little heat could be detected in the van.Save your money on this one."
4,Brinkmann Portable Heater,I purchased the heater for a hunting blind. At 23 Degrees it worked great and in a 4'X4' blind i used it on low. After initial burn there was not any smell. I would buy it again.It would be better if it had a striker on it to light it.
2,Be Prepared,"The Brinkmann Portable Space Heater I puchased from Amazon.Com is not a very useful product. I purchased this product as my son wished to go on his first deer hunt with me. The heater did not fully ignite (whole face should be red, not portions of it) I ran the heater in our large Teepee style tent. When my fellow hunters arrived the next morning, they woke me up and got us out of the tent as the smell of propane was heavy in the tent. My son and I had headaches for hours after getting into fresh air. Upon inspection, it was found the face was not fully igniting allowing unburnt propane to enter our air. On the positive side, the heater did put out some heat allowing my son to warm his hands and feet. I will not be using this particular product again. To add to the product, the built in thermometer did not work. Spend the extra money and purchase a buddy heater. My hunt buddies had one which put out more heat, worked wonderfully, and did not cause headaches or nausia."
4,Nice little heater,"Nice little heater, great to use on a cool night although it takes a while to warm up a 22 foot motor home. It would work better in a small celf contained camper, say 10 to 14 foot.. Wish it had a self igniter, kind of dangerous to light with a match or long propane lighter,"
3,Read description carefully!!,If you are looking for a cable to go between your PC/laptop and your LCD TV...(VGA>Component)....****this is likely not the product for you****. That is what I was looking for...but I didn't read all the details. Most computers don't have the ability to output a component signal. Would not work with my PC (dell) and LCD TV (vizio).If you're using this cable w/ a projector...it will apparently work. Cable construction appears to be very good.
3,Doesn't work with LCD,"I tried to connect a tv receiver to my LCD monitor and it did not work. Apparently, the connections are very specific, so you need to know exactly what the cable is being used for."
2,"Looks nice, but didn't work for me","I tried hooking this up with a newer LCD tv as well as an old CRT TV. I checked the cable type and the inputs on the TVs to make sure they were matched correctly. However, the LCD could not get a signal, and the CRT only got a very distorted signal. Not sure what the problem is--my laptop, my software settings, or the cable. Whatever the case, it didn't work. Oh well."
4,Great Little Switch,"I take this on trips and it really helps. I can get myself and co-workers connected with no problems. No more fighting over a limited number of ports. I've had it around 7 months (purchased March '11).Another reviewer mentioned the plug protruding a bit from the box. I agree; it could be a better, more solid connection, but it works.Note: Amazon put this review under the wrong product; should be...5 PORTS MINI NETWORKING SWITCH"
2,"Lots of beautiful color pictures, but not much else","For each of the 9 ba gua sectors, she lists what to do with each type of room. I excitedly opened the book and began thumbing through it. Let's see, Self-knowledge, my office ... wait - there's no office listed. Ok, let's try Intimate Relationship, Dining Room ... ""have fun with it."" I wonder what she means? Ok - Creative Offspring, kitchen ... ""use all four burners on your stove, even if it is only to boil water."" Huh? Ok then - Health, bathroom ... ""large mirror and upward sconce lighting above the sink."" Ok, the bathroom advice is a little weak, but at least it means something. Hopefully you get the idea. I really wanted to like it, but bottom line is that it's not all that helpful."
2,"Attractive ideas, marginal feng shui content","As a feng shui practitioner-in-training, I take all feng shui manuals and books with a grain of salt. In other words, don't believe everything you read. That's not to say Stasney's book doesn't contain some interesting concepts. If you're looking for some fresh interior design ideas, by all means read and enjoy this book. The photos are attractive, and the book itself is well ordered and thoughtfully written. On the other hand, if you're serious about authentic, traditional feng shui -- meaning real, honest-to-goodness theory and application -- start somewhere else, and pick this book up later as a study to test your knowledge and eye for authenticity. Stasney authorizes liberal use of intuition in your interior design. Which is fine ... but just remember that feng shui is a science, not solely a mere feeling or preference. As with all feng shui books, consider this just book just one of many layers in your living-space analysis."
5,Silence Falling On My Storm,"I listen to Marina Raye's Snow Falling on Silence every day during my commute to and from work. The soothing energy of this music both relaxes as well as energizes me. It is as if the peaceful, blissful energy of this music speaks to my very soul. This CD is one I won't be without. It is more than simply music, it is a healing touch."
5,What a hidden treasure!!,"As a professional in the world and lifestyle of massage, Marina's CDs are a well used tool for the trade. As a person living in the real world these CDs are a tonic for the soul! Soothing, peaceful and stress reducing her CDs will improve your down time."
5,Great Battles of World War II: Battle of Britain,"I bought the other two DVD's to complete my set, which I thought were above average documentaries. I spend much of my time reading and watching documentaries from the Civil War to present. I found these DVD's captivating and interesting. For the price that they cost, they are worth the purchase!"
2,"Only get if you like ""cabaret/Broadway"" ""Jazz""",She has nice voice (and looks great too on cover) but one has to wonder if she had money given this is piano and voice and only 4 tunes.Again if you like Broadway/crossover sound this is worth cheap price of admission but I'd really like to hear this woman with a trio/quartet doing standard material.She has the voice for it just need a band and producer.Do not pay more than buck or two here (I got mine for to cents plus the $3 s/h).Chazz
4,This book really helps you.,I took the AP United States History test last year and I used the Princeton Review book to help me study. They give you good tips and they give you a good review of the many elements of U.S history. They also give you a sample test and explanations for the answers. I wish they included more than one sample test though. This book was really helpful and I earned a 4 on my AP test. This book is worth buying and studying from.
5,Magnifico!!,"This is one of those rare and perfect books, where the writing and the images all come together in utter harmony.Osborne is a master at blending the history of the region with the ambience of the land itself.A book that will certainly make you add Urbino to your list of must-see places in Italy."
2,"Clean cut, but not straight","Blade cuts clean, but it is so thin it tends to curve during the cut. The other blades we have had didn't do this, and I'm certain we will not buy this blade again. If you are cutting a great deal of small, 6 x 6"" tiles or smaller, this is good, but not for 12 x 12 or larger."
3,"Thin kerf blades take less power and cut faster, but deflect more...","And this is no exception. This blade is adequate for certain applications but does tend to wander during cutting due to its thin kerf. It is a well made blade, but not rigid enough for most precise tile work, in my opinion."
4,"Clean cuts, even with porcelain","I use this blade on my small Felker wet saw. It is a clean cutting, cool running blade. Very thin profile as well. Don't have a lot of linear feet on it as of yet, but assume I will have to 'dress it' with cement block after cutting more porcelain-we'll see. Not cheap, but worth it if you are picky about how clean your edges turn out. Haven't used on glass or ceramic yet, but should cut fine-literally."
1,Diamond Hot Dog 10 in. tile blade,"I found that the blad was too thin and did not always cut straight. I chose a little thicker blade that works much better. I have a friend that loves the 7 in. Hot Dog blade. Being only 7 inches, it doesn't bend like the 10 inch."
2,Don't like it,"This blade does not cut 12x12 or larger tiles straight. It flexes way too much for my liking and that obviously has something to do with cutting straight. It is also not possible to shave 1/16"" or less off due to severe blade flex, it just makes a mess of the tile. This is the thinnest kerf blade I own. I now assume it cuts faster with low powered saws but it's not a blade I would buy again as my saw has plenty of power and cuts straight with most all other blades."
5,Beautiful book,I bought this for my dragon-loving four year old. It is beautifully illustrated and a fun story. Highly recommend.
5,This book is fantastic!,"We bought this book some years ago for our oldest son. He still loves looking through it, his brother adores it, and even our 2 year old little girl loves it :) The pictures are fantastic, and there is humor :)"
4,Great book for kids,"Where's the Dragon is a fun book for boys AND girls...the embossed pages make it fun to read, and finding the dragons provides activity as you go along."
5,Wonderfully illustrated,This is a good story with great illustrations. Parts of the story are very funny for young readers. There are alot of hidden dragon images and at the end of the story the reader gets to go back and search for dragons. This is a great way to practice counting with children.
3,"Goal, Motivation & Conflict","This book is useful guide for the novice writer, but I can't recommend it for anyone else. Also, I didn't pay the exorbitant price listed. Shop around."
4,"Excellent book, but very expensive.","I would have given this book five stars, except that you have to take out a mortgage to buy it. I was lucky to find a used copy at a slight savings. Still, this book contains advice for writers that I haven't found in any other book, and the author illustrates her points with familiar examples."
1,"Cheap, Terrible, & Expensive.","I'm an expert paint-by-number painter. This kit is horrible! The template looks nothing like the original art, the colors are all primary colors, its pretty much a cheesy kids's quality paint by number kit. Rose Art should be ashamed to put out such a trashy kit. Note to Rose Art: Please put a picture of the finished art on the COVER, and not an original work by the author, its a cheap, misleading marketing ploy to get us to purchase this low-quality kit. 1 star. Disappointing."
3,"Music Videos, NOT CONCERT FOOTAGE",The previous reviewer is incorrect in referencing concert footage for this videotape. This has the 6 music videos relating to the Invisible Touch album. Total running time is 33 minutes. No concert footage of their classic era music.
5,"A very good occasion to see ""old fashion"" Genesis...","The concert featured in this video is generally very good, with Phil playing quite a bit of drums, and not showing off, as he tends to do sometimes. The lights effects are jaw-droppingly impressive, the sound excellent, and the final with Drum duet/Dance on a volcano/Los endos is excellent, despite not being at the level of the Seconds Out albul level. A must."
2,Surprisingly weak drum & bass/jungle compilation,"Sporting roni size, lemon d, and dj krust. This turns out to be, althought not bad, slightly dissapointing. The start-up track, Saturday by roni size, is cool but seems old and raw and definitely not up to par with songs found on new forms. Other tracks by other artists aren't much better either. But all in all its ok, and has cool ragga from more rockers."
3,"Shoddy, shoddy discs...","What, are these like half burned or something? One disc out of every season doesn't want to play. Other than that, I love it."
4,Pleased with Purchase / original price too high,"The original price looks like a bad joke but I am very pleased with what I got for around...Especially the fact that you can take the dinnerware from the freezer into the oven is great. Not that I always need to do this, but it is convenient to be able to place the plate directly into the oven."
1,Pourquois?,"The great triumvirate of ballet composers, in chronological order are Delibes, Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky. Here we have a wonderful orchestral performance of a Delibes masterpiece conducted by Kent Nagano.Beyond the opportunity to listen to Delibes'score, this production proves its indestructability. I don't necessarily believe that choreographers cannot choreograph known music to their whim........ provided it works. In this case very little does. There is hardly any dancing.... even of the modern variety.... The conceit of a dream sequence showing multiple Coppelias all in red with blonde wigs, some of them in travesti, could have been fun if they were given something interesting to do or to dance. There is neither wit nor arresting movement to this longish sequence. Amazingly, this production has toured all over the world. I don't see it, hence I do not recommend it. If you buy it close your eyes and listen to the music."
4,Great marriage of film and dance,"This innovative little jewel creates a mesmerizing glimpse of the potential for film and dance collaborations. Yes, the story line of Coppelia takes a few bruises, and the dancing is not tutus and pointe shoes, but it is fantastically satisfying storytelling with wonderful dancing. The concept is fresh and the execution is crisp, so what's not to like? As in Zeffirelli's opera films, the use of film creates unique opportunities to stretch the story and to fill in details that are simply not possible during a live stage performance. This film is definitely worth the price, if only to see the potential of dance performance stretched in a marvellously creative manner. We need more dances like this to give new life to the great old warhorse ballets - Bravo!!"
4,Didn't suit my needs,"This is a pretty nice phone. Has a nice lighted keypad and good tone. My problem stemmed from needing to use a headset with it and I could not find a headset that did not amplify my own voice to an uncomfortable degree. In addition, to answer the phone, you simply remove it from the base instead of pressing a ""talk"" button. This takes a little getting used to as hitting the ""talk"" button will turn the phone off and you lose the call. I found Customer Service at ClearSounds to be very helpful although I wasn't able to solve my problem. I only needed the phone in order to hear one friend who has a very soft voice which is difficult for me to hear. The ClearSounds phone does deliver ""Clear Sound""."
1,I would rather sit on the toilet and eat beef jerkey,Im really 22 i didnt feel like singing in. If i was locked in a cell with this game a psp and a box of matches i would burn the game it is horrible and i suggest dont buy it and save a match.
1,Worst B-Ball Game Ever Made (And I've Played Em' All),"I don't know why sony would allow the release of a game this bad. The whole reason I play video games is for entertainment purposes, you know have some fun and release some stress. This game is not fun and only causes stress I can't believe a game this bad was released on psp. You can never make a shot and no matter what team you play against it seem like they make every 3 they take. the only entetaining feature is a side mini game where you can play dodgeball. This game also supports infrastructure for online gameplay I thought maybe that would work out a little bit better, I was wrong it freezes up so much I almost took my psp and played dodgeball with a brickwall. So if you are looking for a decent basketball game for the psp stay away from NBA 06. Its a waist of money a waist of time the game developers should be ashamed with themselves."
5,Facinating account from the past to the present.,"It's amazing that Golway put so much information in such a little space, complete with pictures of all his subjects. An excellent account of Irish history through the personalities that made it. Most of the book covers the 19th and 20th centuries but most of the changes took place in that era. I thought I knew everything about Ireland but I was sure wrong. This book also reads like a novel which makes it even better. I can't wait to read his book on John Devoy."
3,Good overview,"Golway's summary of 1,000 years of Irish history provides a very good overview of the highlights of Irish history. It is a great introduction for someone just starting their study of Ireland's rich history. For those who have delved into the history already, it is an enjoyable read. Golway just skims the surface, though. The collection is far from complete in any of the eras it covers."
4,Untangled a lot of my confusion....,I have long been interested in Irish history but could never quite grasp the centuries of convoluted struggle with Great Britain. This book was invaluable in deepening my understanding of some of the bigger events and figures and I happened to read it shortly before viewing the film The Wind That Shakes The Barley so that I was able to enjoy it with greater sympathy and understanding.Good supplements to this are How The Irish Saved Civilization by Thomas Cahill and Ireland:A Novel by Frank Delaney.
4,Recorder and Friends,"As I write this I am reminded of the two star review of a roasted beet recipe on Epicurious by a woman who confessed she didn't like beets. Well I don't like the high pitch of soprano recorder, and there is a lot of it here. Clearly the players are vertuosi, but the music except for some interesting and at times startling effects I found to be boring and at times aurally painful. Those familiar with the group may know and enjoy the arrangements. Try one before you buy them all -- unless you're wild about recorder. There is a very spirited -- for me over the top -- version of Folie d'Espagne."
5,New York New York,"The more things change, the more they say the same. The best clips on this 2 dvd set are the scenes from the underbelly and ghettos of new york. They make a pretty convincing case for the argument that the problems of crime, unemployment and high rent in New York has been with us for nearly 100 years and not likely to change too. It's interesting to think that even before drugs became popular the same sorts of problems existed.It makes me understand why people moved to the suburbs."
3,Not a good fit,I ordered these jeans due to the fact that it is hard to find this type of pants/jeans in the department stores as I am a true size 4. Most misses departments start at size 6 in a regular or med. length. I was suprised to get these and they fit more like a size 6 petite. I had to send them back. They are nice pants but watch the sizing.
2,Underwhelming Customer Support,"I purchased another VisionTek video card (model 5564) just 8 months ago, and I have to say that I'm not terribly pleased with the company's committment to customers. When I installed Microsoft Flight Simulator, it wouldn't detect my video card; so like any well-trained consumer, I went to VisionTek's site to download the latest drivers. But lo and behold! VisionTek's site offers no drivers or support for any model prior to the 9100, when they switched from Nvidia chips to ATI chips. The support that _is_ available is sketchy at best--two FAQs and a forum, where strangely, there's no place to post questions on any earlier product either. When I wrote their customer service organization for help, the advice I received was a one-line response suggesting I update the drivers. Thanks, VisionTek. Before you purchase this, or any, VisionTek product, make sure you check their website and find out more about their ongoing support."
4,This ones for you - PCI Version,I recently installed this card on a rebuilt Compaq for my friend. The Compaq had integrated video on the mother board and no AGP slots. He wanted it set up to play Sims 2 which requires a direct x 9.0 compatible card. I'm happy with the card because it was quick and easy to install and plays Sims 2 with no problem despite the fact the computer is only a Celeron III 800. If your looking for a nice video card that's not going to break the bank this ones for you.
3,design and art in B&W,"A great deal of information, focused on individuals and their contributions to the Bauhaus. ALL pages are in black and white, which is always a great disappointment when reading about art, design or architecture. Considering this production shortcoming, the book is overpriced. Its written content, very useful and thorough."
3,A decent overview of eating disorders,"As an eating disorder counselor, I've worked with over two thousand women with eating disorders at an inpatient treatment facility. This book gives a good overview of what an eating disorder is, what it can do to a life, and the great changes that come with recovery. But it is just that, an overview. Because the stories are short, they cannot paint a deep picture of who these people (in the book) are, or the true self-destructive nature of eating disorders. This book is inspiring in that you will read about several people who have made significant changes in their lives for the better, but you will not come away with a particularly deep understanding of the diseases. This is a good book to read if you are hopeless about your own eating disorder, but not if you want to learn about eating disorders overall."
5,"""Interesting and Educational""","""Appetite for Life"" is one of the most interesting books that I have read on the subject of eating disorders. Reading about seven people and their experiences made the problem much more understandable than just a regular how-to book. I like how the author combines these stories and examples from her therapy practice. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about eating disorders."
5,Majestic,"""A Dream Of Blue"" and ""Kate"" are vast epics, comparable in length to ""Antarctica"", but with far more structure and variation. They start simple but gradually twist and tangle into huge complex structures of sound, with Windy's voice adding subliminal, indecipherable hints throughout. As with ""Antarctica"", I found the title to be very indicative of the music -- these pieces are dreams, and they leave you confused and disoriented. Then you play the CD again and it all comes back..."
1,left a green ring around my finger,"I thought this was a absolutely cute ring when I took it out of the package, I was later disappointed when I took it off and noticed the green ring left on my skin, I can't wear anything but sterling silver so I question if this ring is real or not..still a cute ring but I can't wear it"
3,Elephant Ring,"This ring is really cute!! The price is excellent! My only problem with this ring is that it catches on everything. Towels, sweaters, jean pockets, etc. Of course, I wear it anyway, but you must be careful you don't damage other things!!"
3,Good offline reference,Would be nice to have more examples.------------------Cheers.LordAlex Leonwww.lordalex.org
5,A Sweet Little Book,"This is a sweet little book that I read to my daughter when she was a small child and she loved it. It's about sweet little animal families in the forest. Their words of love are reasurring to any small child and they will ask that it be read to them many, many times. I recommend this book to any mother with small children. She will love it almost as much as they do."
4,Loved this book but wondering where the daddy raccoon is....,"I love Margaret Wise Brown's writings for children. I nearly always choose THE MOON SHINES DOWN to give as a baby shower gift.This is the first time however that I have read WAIT TILL THE MOON IS FULL ~ and I was surprised that through out the book, there is never any mention of a daddy raccoon taking part in what baby raccoon wants to know. I personally would have preferred that the entire family take part ~ daddy, mommy, & child. Still, it is a cute book with excellent illustrations but no daddy. For that reason alone, I wouldn't ever buy it and give it as a gift. And that's nothing against single parents....I've been one myself....but I prefer to share stories that include a daddy & a mommy."
2,Not nearly as good as I'd hoped,"Our family loves Margaret Wise Brown and we also love raccoons, as we sometimes do wildlife rehab and work with raccoon babies. Our son's favorite book is Little Fur Family, so we thought surely this would be a hit as well. Unfortunately the book drags on and on, nothing at all happening until the very end when the little raccoon finally gets the okay to go outside to play. That's it. My book-loving son was pushing this one away a few pages in, and I wanted to do the same. So much buildup for a fizzle at the end, and it's not even as if real raccoon babies would wait for a full moon to go out anyway! This book was surprisingly dull. Imagine an entire book full of ""wait, you can't go outside yet"" page after page, then finally, ""okay, now you can go out."" There you have it. Definitely lacks the magical charm and sweetness of Little Fur Family."
5,A wonderful childhood memory to pass on,"I have been looking for a copy of this book for years. While visiting my brother recently I discovered that he had the copy that we read over and over again when we were children. It's in poor shape, a testimony to the use it received. He wouldn't part with it, so I am so pleased to find it available again. I'm sure my 2-year old grandson will enjoy this sweet and gentle story as much as I did."
5,Great End to a Great Trilogy,"If you love knights, handsome men, and witty humor, then I believe you will enjoy this book and it's entire series. The last book in the ""The Lady Series"", I found, was a great ending. I would love if Ms. Stratton continued this series!However, if you are particular about historical facts and writing errors, then you probably won't enjoy this book. I admit, there aren't a couple of errors--there are quite a few--but it wasn't enough to bother me to put down the book.I believe that some of the reviews left in regards to this book were very harsh! I love cute romances, and I especially love handsome knights in shining armor. If you do too, then please give this series a chance!If you enjoyed the movies A Knight's Tale or Ever After, then I highly recommend this series to you!"
5,The best in the Series,"I loved Lady Knight and Lady Seer, and this 3rd book certainly didn't disappoint! Of course, being the third book has its advantages because you already know the characters. But seriously, if you like medieval adventures, and this one takes you to France as well as England, you will love this book."
5,a great looking book,"I've only tried one of the recipes so far and it was good, but the additional value of the book is the way it looks, the illustrations are really charming and the design, flawless. It would make a prefect gift."
5,Southernly Sweet,"First of all, the the illustrations are nice. That always makes me like a cook-book more for some reason. The baking tips, and how they are organized is really nice too.This cookbook has it all when it comes to Southern snacks. From Peach Ice cream, to cream puffs to candies, and more. She captures the true Southern spirit. The story telling is nice, and there are some unique and interesting recipe's here too- like Fig Cake, and Shoofly pie."
2,"cuts easily, but is too thin and bends","I had purchased this blade to cut porcelain tile for a bathroom. It created nice, smooth cuts, but the blade was so thin it had a tendency to bend and would not make a straight cut! In the end, I cannot recommend this blade since it's thin-ness causes it to bend, and ultimately messes up the cuts."
1,Blade was unusable,"I saw the other reviews and bought this blade to cut travertine tile. While the blade I received was not visibly damaged, it certainly did not cut as expected. The first strange thing I noticed was that the width of the cut was substantially wider than the saw blade which is, I assume, due to the slots cut into the blade. The width of the cut, while disappointing, was not a major issue however. The real issue was that at the end of the cut, the blade consistently left an 1/8"" little knob of tile on one side. This made the blade unusable. I ended up going to a local tile supply store and found a truly continuous rim blade and replaced this blade with it."
5,Smooth like Butter,"I have the 10"" version of this blade and it is amazing.The cuts are as smooth as the normal sides of the tiles and there is no break out or splintering what-so-ever.This is one of the better blades that I have come across and I am now sticking to it exclusively.I have been cutting thick porcelan (sp) tile and it was wearing out blades fairly quick for being diamond blades. The blade would get dull and the tile would heat up and it would cause the very end of the cuts to snap off roughly and it did not look very good. When I got the MK Diamond Hot Dog it made life easier and the cuts are much cleaner. Plus the feed rate is increased and the amount of force used to pull the blade through the tile is minimal.Truely one of the best blades I have ever seen."
5,Worked well!,"I was not sure if I need Metra 99-6505 or this one. This one has much less parts but I figured out it's just what I wanted. (In addition, this one stated that it's good for the stereos with detachable panels.)Worked perfectly for me.Helpful installation notes:[...]"
4,Fits neat and nice,An easy install that went smoothly as I followed directions. This has a texture to the plastic that fits well with my car's interior.
3,Hurry Less,More God oriented then I had thought. It had been recoomeded by a friend who really liked it. It was used but in excellent shape.
2,Below average. Not suggested,"I had read Joyce Meyer's ""21 ways to finding peace and happiness"" right before this. I gave that a five star and placed it in my listmania list. That definitely affected my judgement of this, which I think, is quite inferior in all aspects. In case you believe in Christ and want to read something to improve your living/peace of mind etc like what most self help books attempt, please give this a pass. The one mentioned above and Rick Warren's ""God's answers to life's difficult questions"" are much better."
5,Beautiful Cruel Land,The author's recollections of her childhood are quite vivid. When I finished the book I ony wished she had continued her memories into several more books
1,"Beautiful,Cruel and Tedious","This was a choice for my book club. I wouldn't have red it otherwise. I found the book repetitious and quite tedious in thememoirs of an 84 year old woman discussing her early childhood growing up on the border of Arizona and Mexico where she spendsher time as a 5 and 6 year old from 1909 to 1911. It is hard to belive that as a 5 year old girl she was out herding cattle androunding up wild horses by herself.The descriptions of the landscape in the southern part of Arizona were well written. But, I would have liked to know more aboutwhat happened in the author's life beyond those two years of childhood. Luckily for me The person leading the discussion has researchedthis information. I would only recommend reading this book if you are truly interesed in the Southwest in the early 1900s and wantto do more research on the author."
4,Great for Acne Skin,This product is the only product that I found can moisturize my acne prone skin. It moisturized my face all day long. It works perfectly under makeup too. I just wish they have bigger bottle and it has a pump. I also wish the shipping cost would be less expensive too!
2,strategy not quite working,"I have entered strategy in the system, but seems like that most of them not quite accurate. Any help?"
5,Great Secretariat book,I loved the price being used. Actually loved the used and old feel of this book. Wasn't sure if I would enjoy so I decided to try the used price. I loved the book and even more a special hardback copy.
3,more of the same,the author appears to have done her homework. the book is tedious in parts and in some instances does not present a very flattering picture of somone who after four decades is immensely popular with his fans. i am sure fans.. who have followed his career may find that there are certain things that are better left unsaid. i think some of his fans will take a great interest in being able to have a current biography
4,Is there anybody out there................?,"Brilliantly written ......... but still much to learn about this seemingly quietly overprotected superstar.So , what about his 'behind the scenes' lifestyle?First hand knowledge through a friend , brings to light his 'dangerous liasons'and 'playing with fire' , so to speak.Are there any girls out there whom have had personal one on one experiences with him?We'd love to hear about it.More needs to be written about this ""Knight in shining"".......A rather enigmatic personality who seems to get away with everything....?How does he do it?"
3,The real truth behind the man,"Have read all the books, stories, coverage etc. on Tom Jones and still yet have to add to that.I have had a personal, Close - up and personal experience with him that affected my whole life (possibly for the better) and am looking for a ghostwriter to write my story.It has never been told and might give a new light on him and his life. Serious ghostwriters can e-mail at:nydiamond31@hotmail.com"
2,DOES THE JOB?,"THIS DOES THE JOB , BUT IT IS A CHEAP PLASTIC UNIT WITH FLIMSEY PARTS AND TAKES ZERO ABUSE. NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT HOLDING YOUR STEREO. A TIP, BUY YOUR DASH ADAPTER KIT FROM CRUTCHFIELD."
4,Adorable,My daughter picked out this costume for Halloween. She looked adoraoble in this costume (she is 3). The quality is so so (as with any childrens costumes these days) but we received several compliments on this costume. Very cute!
4,Pretty cool,I like the product because it held up very well. My daughter had to wear it at three separate occasions during the Halloween festivities and each time it looked like new.
4,Adorable!,"The costume is as pictured. It is of a lower grade quality material than I would have liked, but I just layered real clothes and tights underneath and it worked fine for trick or treating."
4,"Cute, good value, but not perfect","I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She's 36 inches tall and weighs 30 pounds. She usually wears a size 2T. I bought the size medium and it fit okay, with plenty of room to spare. It would probably fit a child sized 3T a little better. I will need to do some minor alterations due to the size at the collar (far too baggy) and poor workmanship in one of the seams.Overall, it's a very cute costume. I love the little bow on the skeleton - perfect for my little pirate girl! However, the boot covers leave a lot to be desired. They look very odd on her. We may skip those when she wears the costume.I don't think it is a very durable costume, but for $15, it's pretty decent."
4,Pirate costume is precious.,I bought this pirate costume for my three year old. She wanted to be a pirate for Halloween and I thought this costume looked really cute. It's not the most durable (fabric is thin) but I was just looking for the one to two time wear. I think it will work really well. The top is nice because it ties in the back so you don't have to worry about it hanging to loose. My daughter wears a size 4 to 5 so I bought a large (4-6). It's just right.
2,cute by way too small,"I have a almost 5 yr old and the costume was too small it says 4-6 but truly it is a size 4, the issue really is not the costume but rather the stockings, they do not stretch and showed the white part on top, I put underwear on top of it to try to hold it in place but it is strange because again does not stretch at all. I will probably keep it because the price is good and we are going on a Disney cruise so she will use it once for pirate night, planning to put something else beneath. My sister in law tried on her 6 yr old who is so skinny and not too tall and same issue."
1,For kids or not?,"Is this game for anyone? Way to go sony development. Hmm. We have to ship a hockey game when the psp comes out. Let's just half finish this piece of hooey, and tack gretsky's name on it. This game is complete trash. I would be embarassed if I were Sony. Camera is terrible, game is slow, controls are terrible.Bottom line: Is it fun? No. Will I keep it? Some poor sap already won it from me on Ebay. Is it for Kids? If you are training your child to find the worst videogames in the history of mankind. Can you smell the stench of rushed first generation games?"
2,This is bad!,This is the worst hockey game ive ever played. Im a fan of hockey and this was an embarrasment. The framerate was flawed and the computer opponents can beat you with ease on the easiest setting. Of about 10 games i won 2 of them.This game had so much potential. It just messed up.
5,A rocking trip through outerspace!,"This is a fun album in the best tradition of concept/rock operas from Tommy to American Idiot. It's a little bit goofier than those, but totally benefits from Clawjob's sense of humor. The songs are so good you'll catch yourself singing them without even realizing it. Don't miss it!"
3,Dzien Dobry,This is a fun and quick way to pick up some Polish. I used it for a trip to Poland and felt less disoriented than I would have without it. Too bad it's out of print. Alas.Do Widzenia
1,I wound't advise anyone to read this book,"I wound't advise anyone to read (the less so to buy) this book. I don't mean any offence, but the book is poorly written, with no sense of structure or narrative construction. You have always the impression that what you are reading is nothing other than a boring pile of big, big words, scattered around in a most artless fashion. The book's extreme verbosity cannot cover for its obvious lack of style.There are people who never stop talking about themselves, but then fancy the idea that they are also writers, that could be a dissaster.L Oprescu"
2,"Its nice enough but it is not creole,","I got this book expecting my gumbo's, roux, piquante's, bisques and king cakes, but no it interprets creole as Caribbean food! Even the back blurb says 'authentic traditional and modern recipes from the sun drenched islands in the Caribbean'!There are a lot of recipes in here I would never associate with creole, such as callaloo, jerk seasoning, pepperpot, conch and lots of food with papaya and mango. Why this was not called caribbean cooking I will never know. In fact there is not one classic creole recipe in the whole book! however it does dedicate 14 pages to jerk and different jerk rubs which is great.Its a shame as creole books are hard to come by and this apple press series of 'cooking' books are surprisingly good with nice pictures and easy recipes. But this one did dissapoint. 2 stars purely for some nice tasting recipes."
2,Streatches to a giant bag!,It feels soft and looks great ... until you put it on and take off. It streatched to a massive size and looked like an old baggy hand me down. I returned it.
4,Nice read,"This was a very interesting look at Tahitian culture and their primitive belief systems. It is probably comparable to many other cultures that rely on superstition, rather than education, to help them navigate through the perils of life.While I think Vaite is a great writer, her main character actually annoyed me with her level of ignorance. I wanted to yell at her, and shake her, and teach her!! She was just that real, which shows the author really defined her character.Fun read..."
3,Cute beach book....,"I picked this book up because I went to Tahiti for my honeymoon earlier this year, and thought it would be interesting to read a novel written by a native Tahitian. (Perhaps I was also longing for an escape back to the islands.) Frangipani is a story of a mother-daughter relationship and provides a glance into island living throughout the tale. Materena is the mother whose daughter, Leilani, is a constant challenge to her. Materena is set in her ways and Leilani doesn't hesitate to question Materena's ways, her decisions in life, and her future goals. The main drama of the story arises when Leilani falls in love with a dentist. The story, while charming, moves very slowly; there's not much to the plot. It's not the greatest book I've ever read but it is a cute, easy read. It would make a good beach book. Pack a bag with Frangipani, a swimsuit, and sun screen and head to Tahiti."
5,Just what I needed,"I love Nancy's humorous style, combined with her wisdom and wonderful perspective. I just keep reading my copy over and over. Many great Bible verses quoted throughout which help encourage the reader."
1,Wrong book....,"Ordered the solutions manual from the company and got a nineteenth century romance novel instead... Sure, it was a good read. But it isn't going to help me out much this semester..."
4,Mathematics,"This book was great, got it really fast and has saved me a lot of money. Was my first experience on amazon and it was great."
1,NORTEL MERIDIAN M2250 CONSOLE,"We purchased the console as a replacement. The console did not work. When we called the tech they did not want to help because they were leaving for the day. The tech said ""We don't test those before we send them."" So, according to the tech they are sending products out that they have no idea whether the products are working. I was completely dissatisfied and returned the product."
4,rare information on Mormon's 1846 and the War with Mexico,"this book tells a Story of a battalion formed following the bloody and illegal expulsion of the Mormons from Missouri, and how they fought in the New war with Mexico in hopes of finding a new Land of Zion. Interesting in its Mormon saga in our American heritage. True to history and true to life"
4,It was good,This movie was really good does anyone know who sings the song bounce in the opening credits.
2,Mala calidad,"Mi esposo es fanatico de Trespatines y se lo compré para el Dia del Padre. Que desilusión. La grabación es malísima. Se corta, brinca, se tranca, en total no pudimos verla. No boten el dinero, no vale el precio."
5,Worked Very Well,"Used this blade while laying about 600 SF of tile. Cut nicely, much better than the blade that came with the saw. A must have I believe for porcelain tile. Nice thin cuts."
5,MK Diamond Hot-Dog Porcelain cutting blade,"Excellent, Exceptional, Great, Terrific.This blade is absolutely wonderful.I destroyed 5 carbide and 1 diamond scroll saw blades trying to cut a 9 inch cicle divided between 2 porcelain tiles.Having run out of scroll saw blades, I cut many slots in the tiles, at different angles until I removed enoughof the tile to fit where it was needed.I also cut about 200 porcelain tiles. the blade is showing signs of getting dull, but still cutting well.If you've worked with ceramic but not porcelain tiles, you REALLY NEED this blade.I would buy these blades again in a heartbeat.I need to find out if they also make wood cutting blades."
2,Not that great of a blade...,"I don't know why, but I tried this blade on porcelain, and it just did not make clean cuts! It actually cut worst than the stock Husky blade! Not sure if it was just a bad blade from the start. Maybe someone has any ideas why? It just did not make clean cuts and I did not feel confident using it. I really thought it was going to be a great blade!"
5,MK Diamond Hot Dog 7inch,"Nice blade, maybe a bit overkill for a DIY on a small job. Worth it if you've got > 500sqft to do. I used it for 500sqft of Porcelain tile and another 250sqft of travertine. The porcelain as expected it cut through like butter, but it did just as good of job on the travertine w/ no chipping.It was installed in a Husky 7"" Wet saw w/ stand (THD-950)"
4,Good Saw for Porcelain,"I'm glad I ordered this blade at the same time I received my MK-170 from MK Diamond. My entire bath remodel is in porcelain, and this blade cut almost like butter. My only disappointments are the price (high) and where made (Korea). I bought it from MK Diamond thinking that it was made by their firm in Calif. It was shipped out of a vendor warehouse in Illinois. It doesn't have an arrow indicating how it should be installed. If you put it on your saw with the print facing you as it's installed, you should be okay. The company is a little thin on any instructions or information about the blade. Overall, a good blade, though a tad on the expensive side."
5,Works Well - Decent Price,"The price through Amazon was reasonable for the performance of this blade. Worked as advertised. Cut Travertine and ceramic like going through butter, with no chipped edges. I have used pricier blades that worked as well, but why spend extra when you don't have to? Can't speak of longevity yet ... only did one room with it.UPDATE: Have cut through a ton of tile with this thing. Blade life is at least as good as pricier blades. Good blade - good price."
4,Avalanche history,"The book details the 1910 avalanche near Stevens Pass, Washington (state) which caused the largest loss of life so far from an avalanche in America, when a passenger train was swept off the tracks into a ravine. It also looks at a 1910 forest fire in Idaho and Montana. The writer interviewed survivors and others with first-hand knowledge, and pored through court documents to find witness statements. That perspective is fascinating to me. However, the writer (Ruby El Holt) has difficulty translating all that into believable dialog. But, I bought it for the facts of the incidents, not the fictional conversations, so I'm happy. The condition of the used book is just as the seller described, and actually much better than I expected, so again I'm happy. I'd recommend the book for people with an interest in avalanches, railroad history, or just life in the 1910's."
4,Southern romance,"Susan Lucci puts out all her southern hospitality in this movie, but is she a murderess? New Orleans police investigate and actor Lee Horsley must be the one to find out if she is really is a sweet southern belle or if should he resist her charms. Plot has a nice twist and keeps your interest if you like this genre."
4,Kids and Money Mean Danger Without Proper Guidance,"As the author of a book about parenting, I found this book an essential read for parents of young children. Schools don't teach kids about money, so it is up to parents to do so. A book like this, filled with ideas to help your kids understand how money works, why it doesn't grow on trees and that money comes with effort is a good start to the lessons to make them money savvy. A worthwhile addition to any parent's library."
4,Independent and low-budget but something comes across....,"I saw this movie at a local filmmaker's showcase screening in Oakland a few years ago. While it is very low-budget (the director was at the screening and said they had around $10,000), it is also a thoughtful character study that shines a bit of light on the humanity vs. fame debate, and has tense moments and a few good performances (and a few, well, not-so). The writing is fresh, and if you can handle the low-budget, this one may make you think a little... Why do we make celebrities out of people that do horrible things? And do those people know that before they do those things?"
2,Maybe I recieved a bad batch?,"I've been drumming for quite sometime now, primarily playing shows a few times a month. I would consider myself a hard-hitting player. I've had GREAT luck with Aquarian kick drum heads in the past, I like the Super-Kick line as they give a great tone and feel so I decided to upgrade to the SKII22. I recieved the head, installed it and enjoyed two practices with it before the inner muffling ring fell off completely and the kick sounds horrible. I think next time I'm going to stick with the original SKI22."
3,"Nice, but...",I liked the Evans EMAD drum head a bit better. The Aquarian was a bit too muted for me.
4,Stacking Toy,"You stack these 5 cubes by lining up the triangles. It is a good problem solving toy because you have to figure out how to position each so it lines up and stacks correctly. Each also has its own little activity, so that's another demention of play. These hold my 17-month-old's attention, and I do think they have plenty to offer. I recommend them."
2,Stacking Cubes,My 14 month old refuses to play with them. I guess they aren't interesting enough for him.
4,Wonderful Shoes,I love the way they look and they are reasonably comfortable. They are well sewn and well designed. My only complaint is that they are a bit heavy for a boat shoe. A little over built I guess. I expected a lighter shoe.
4,simple but classy,"I replaced my old dinner plates with these. I like the contemporary, unpretentious, clean look, and (of course!) the brand name. Goes well with most serving pieces."
3,He's no Data,"I found this book to have a fascinating concept that fell short of expectation. Except for Little Miss and Sir, Andrew's family never developed well as we sped through generations. I thought it remarkable how NDR become increasingly more manipulative as he became more ""human."" Interesting worldview. I wonder why the authors' hadn't explored a marriage for Andrew to see just how he handled the real world..."
5,My favorite by Asimov,"I'm a huge fan of Isaac Asimov and I've read his classic Foundation trilogy countless times, but this was my favorite. This book has things to say not just about hard SF but about the human condition as well."
3,The original is better,"Not a bad novel, but I found the original Asimov much more compelling. This book seems longer solely for the sake of being longer. The original story is available in several compilations, such as The Complete Robot."
5,Ultra-different,"tom jenkinson has done it again. on 'ultravisitor', like his other releases, he combines jazzy abstraction with drill'n'bass type beats on the opening track. the next three tracks are beautifully crafted solos on the bass and/or guitar. the next track '50 cycles', is a somewhat of a glitch-hop track with a uk mc sputtering some rhymes you cant really make out. the next track 'menelec', is a typical but mind blowing drill'n'bass breakdown. another track that really stand out to me is 'steinbolt' which sounds like a live performance of hard beats, tweaked out dark synth stabs, and distorted bass progessing into an electronic noise overdrive, and then slows back down to a steady pace then stops. most of the other tracks after that are live performances and solos. overall, if you are a true squarepusher fan, this album will not dissapoint. if you are just starting to get into SP i would reccomend 'hard normal daddy' or 'go plastic!'. both which are of the original squarepusher sound."
3,Borrowed emulations,"3 1/2Although perhaps offering the creative beat driller's most impressive overview to date, somehow this ultra-long concoction ranging from typically-brain-drillingly electro spazz-outs to Steve Hackett-esque instrumental prowess seems to borrow and bloat too much from past technique in able to rise as a whole piece."
4,"Not my favorite Squarepusher album, but not disappointing","I have just been introduced to Squarepusher, and I have mixed opinions about some of Squarepusher's music. Some of his previous albums I seem to really like, and there are several tracks in this album that I have come to love like Iambic 9 Poetry. But then there are some that I don't enjoy listening to, such as Steinbult. Ultravisitor is an interesting mix of drum n' bass songs and techno that somg may love, but some may hate. If you're into electronica or drum n' bass, you should check this album out.Ultravisitor- 8/10I Fulcrum- 9/10Iambic 9 Poetry- 10/10Andrei- 10/1050 Cycles- 7/10Menelec- 8/10C-Town Smash- 6/10Steinbolt- 5/10An Arched Pathway- 6/10Telluric Piece- 7/10District Line II- 8/10Circlewave- 9/10Tetra-Sync- 6/10Tommib Help Buss- 9/10Every Day I Love- 9.5/10"
5,Simply learn - then earn,"You can find 100 books on this subject, but Steve Sullivan makes the common sense process of selling enjoyable to read and easy to learn. It is amazing how uncommon the common sense approach is. Learn the forgotten process of ""personalizing the relationship with the customer""...and make the sale. Bottom line - Alot of bang for the buck!"
1,Selling Made Simple,"I am a sales trainer and consultant and most of my clients are big multi-national corporations. I believe this is one of the worst sales know-how books I have read in a long time. There is no coherant sales processes or concepts in this book. Just whole bunch of war stories and random tips. The content was so disorganized, I stopped reading it about half-way through...."
2,Colonialism.,"Loti was a professional seaman. When his ship is moored in Nagasaki, he contacts a matrimonial agent for a 'temporary marriage' with a young Japanese girl, Madame Chrysanthème.The novel narrates his sexual (?), and in any case loveless, relationship with the girl as if Loti is keeping a diary, very anecdotally.Loti has not the slightest interest in the Japanese soul. This work has absolutely no psychological content. Loti looks as a real colonialist disdainful and amused upon Japan and the Japanese.If this novel would have been written today, it would certainly be called racist.But it gives a good picture of Nagasaki at the end of the 19th century.To be read as a document about the relationship between the East and the West in the 19th century and about the arrogant mentality in the West at that time."
3,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS,"Many people claim that this is a good introduction to Wittgenstein's later thought but I have found it quite difficult to follow (even though it PRECEDED Philosophical Investigations.) I would start with Wittgenstein's ON CERTAINTY, ironically his ""last"" work."
5,Changed my life,"If I can recall the one book that influenced my thoughts, even my life, more than any other, it would have to be Wittgenstein's Blue Book. It is THE reason to ever learn how to read!"
4,Mayfair & Jackson Pie Dish,"Since my husband is a pie junky I thought I'd purchase this deeper dish. It's not perfectly round, mine is slightly off, but being somewhat of a perfectionist I couldn't help noticing the flaw, no one else will probably ever notice. (lol)It's also great for soups, salads, cobblers, costadas and meat dishes.Let your imagination run wild. Took off a star for the flaw.Worth every penny tho'!"
2,"""CD Cover Wrong""","I am wanting to know why the photo says other CD Albums: The Complete Collection with Connie Scott with Forever Young, Hold On & Christmas in Your Heart and not the photo of Heartbeat & SpiritMover?Also do you have the lyrics (words) with the CD's?Thanks."
2,"Like Reading Roget's Thesaurus, But With Lots of Sex","In ""Total Surrender,"" Cheryl Holt attempts to join the growing movement of women writing intelligent and romantic erotica for other women. Unfortunately, that boat has sailed without her this time. Holt's idea of writing an intelligent story seems to consist mainly of filling her prose with as many ""big words"" as she can find, even if they often make little or no sense in the context, or when a smaller, much more common word would have been the better choice. Yes, this book is very steamy, but the heroine is a dolt, the hero is a cad, and the prose is very purple, so unless your idea of great erotica is the ""Letters to Penthouse,"" you should pass on this one. Cheryl Holt's first book, ""Love Lessons,"" was better."
2,Boring! A big let down,Well I was excited to read this story. I had enjoyed LOVE LESSONS so much that I started this one right away. I was very disappointed in the story. It lacked the emotion of the other book. This one was just sex and not much else. I didn't like Michael and he didn't improve any along the way. Sarah was a bit more likeable especially towards the end. I like finding out what had happened to James and Abigail from the first story. I wish I could have liked this more. The sex scenes are hot but I wouldn't call them love scenes. This book will not be read again by me.
2,Less 'sex' please and more romance!,"I am by no means prudish and enjoy a romance (in whatever form, i.e. historical, thriller, etc.) with sex scenes as long as they move the plot along and/or are important for the characters' development. This, I feel, can not be argued for this book. The sex is tawdry (note: sex not making love) and dare I say it, made me feel icky; the reason is that it's not romantic or special and just plain dull. I felt that once I'd read one scene that I'd read them all - and there were more than a few. As for the plot, it's standard historical romance fare - tortured hero meets spinster and forms a 'relationship', a misunderstanding develops that separates the two lovers and all is resolved in the standard happy ending. There is no panache or real originality in the writing of this, and the author's style of writing is not attractive. All in all, I won't be buying another of Cheryl Holt's books - this was my first and last experience of her writing."
2,Disappointing!,"I have previously read Cheryl Holt's Love Lessons and enjoyed it tremendously. It was romantic as well as very erotic. I cannot say the same about Total Surrender. There was something missing in this book. It never really captured my interest and it took me weeks(!) to complete this novel.I will think twice about buying her books, simply because they are very repititive."
3,NOT A MUST READ,"The story started off well, then when downhill fast. I did not feel that enough was written about the couple getting to know each other and too much of it was left to the imagination. I just never had any strong feelings about this couple at all. The hero was not very likable and it was not believable that this woman would fall in love with him."
1,1.5 stars,"This plot line had me very annoyed. It's almost a given in romance novel-especially Regencies/historicals, that the hero acts in an asinine way towards to heroine. Usually we expect that the said hero sees the error of his ways, and seeks out the heroine asking for forgiveness. Or maybe he doesnt seek her out, but when he does realise he acted like an a$$, he either begs forgiveness, makes some speech, does SOMETHING...ANYTHING to show REMORSE.Cheryl Holt decided to not have that in her novel (how provincial, she may have though).It really bothered me that for 6 months the heroine was scared wondering how she could eat/live because she was sent away and had no income, and the hero was so caught up in himself he didn't try to find out if she needed aid. And when they did meet up, it was all about sex- or sexual congress as Holt would have called it.All in all, ineffectual hero and silly plot."
3,Disappointing,"I enjoyed Holt's Love Lessons, but Total Surrender frankly bored me. The main characters were not fully fleshed out and never really came to life for me; neither seemed to have much depth to his/her character. The story itself didn't really engage me and seemed almost like an afterthought to link the erotic scenes."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"Ah, where do I begin? There were so many, many things that were wrong with this book. Both the hero and heroine were largely unsympathetic characters. Mind you, I have nothing against unsympathetic characters--if they make sense. Michael Stevens and Sarah Compton did not, nor did any of their actions. I was vastly disappointed with this book--Michael was such an interesting character in Love Lessons. In this one, he was nothing like he was depicted to be earlier. To compound this flawed characterization, the storyline was bland and the repetitiveness of the author's word choice irritating. This was a total waste of time."
2,"Great sex, little else","In sum, this tale serves as little more than a frame around a bunch of interesting sexual encounters between a spinster and a rake. Neither come across as particularly appealing or sympathetic characters. I was, in fact, sympathetic to the heroine until she was unjustly accused of scheming to manipulate the hero into matrimony...and then she started to burble happily about it to him at the wedding, when it should have been glaringly obvious to the woman, shown until this point as highly perceptive and intelligent, that her new husband was furious, had just been trapped and tricked, and he plainly thought she was in league with the villain who had put him in this situation. There was no logic to her euphoria, which just made her look as much a user as her villainous brother. Indeed, the heroine is actually very manipulative and pushy in this book, and I didn't much care as to her fate."
2,"Half steamy sex, half ... wait there IS no other half","Yes, the sex was steamy. But there was no relationship between the two main characters. They spent more time talking to themselves in their heads than they did to each other. Sarah, apparently, is extremely good at reading body language, as this is how she learned all about Michael. Michael only needed to know that he lusted after Sarah. Michael's relationship with family friend Pamela was better developed. What a disappointment!"
4,This was 1st Cheryl Holt novel I've read,"I really enjoyed this novel. The one thing that kept it from being a 5 star in my book is that she spent so much time writing out the charactgers thoughts, that after a while I found myself getting bored. Also I really didn't think that a marriage would work in reality with these two and when she decides to bring them back together, they fall right in with each other again even after all the pain that was felt in their 6 months apart. I also wish the author let us know what happened to Pamela. I mean if Sarah was willing to forgive her husband she should have forgiven Pamela. Well they were just my observations and I must say that by page 317 I would not have forgiven Michael, but that doesn't make a good romance novel. I know that this doesn't sound like I liked the book, but I really did enjoy it. I just wanted to point out some parts that I found took away from a 5 star rating."
1,NOT VERY HAPPY !!!!!!,"I HAVE NOT YET USED THIS TILE CUTTER AS THE....CUTTING KIT..... DID NOT ARRIVE WITH IT..SO HERE I AM WAITING FOR THE CUTTING KIT..I HAVE NOT EVEN PUT THE TILE CUTTER TOGETHER,WHATS THE POINT !!! SO AS YOU CAN GUESS.I AM NOT VERY HAPPY. B WAUGAMAN"
5,Great bag,I really liked this back. My cat pee'd in it the other day so I bought a Mizuno Vintage beacuse it was a little bit bigger inside. But I actually prefer the G2 it looks better.
5,Worked great.,The kit had all the parts for a variety of installations and a handy manual the showed what to do for many different vehicles.
4,Great kit for EQ installations.,Installed this kit with a Clarion head unit and EQ some minor dash filing was required but looked great when done.
3,DID NOT WORK FOR WHAT IT WAS CALLED FOR,PRODUCT SAID IT WORKED FOR MY TRUCK AND WHEN RECEIVED IT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL. very pleased with sender but not for the actual product
4,Soulful Longing,"The music in this soundtrack is so fitting for the pace of this beautiful but sad love story told to us at a slow easy going pace. My favorite tract being Yumeji's Theme evokes deep emotions from within. Each time it plays in the movie there is no need for words as every glance, motion and thoughts are made known though left unsaid. In a time when movies only include the latest pop music for the sake of profit making this soundtrack rises above all as one which is fitting for the story it unfolds."
5,LOVE-SICK INTOXICATION BLUES,"A reviewer below mentions listening to the first track hundreds of times. Make that two of us. An absolutely mesmerizing soundtrack to accompany an absolutely mesmerizing film. (Apart from Umebayashi Shigeru's lilting and erotic first track, do not miss Michael Galasso's Angor Wat theme -- pure sadness at its beautiful best.)"
5,A great soundtrack for a lover of WKW films,"I loved the film, so I love the soundtrack, which brings back memories of the film. WKW uses period music to evoke the emotions and feel of the time period of the film."
4,Excellent soundtrack,"This is the soundtrack of a recent movie by Wong Kar-Wai, Hong Kong art house director. Anyone who enjoyed the movie will remember the music in the movie too. I was striken by the music when watching the movie. It is so nostalgic, and blue..."
4,Practical Advice and Powerful Reminders,"I found the book readable and extremely practical. Success isall about action, often simple or relatively easy actions, butin the end we must get off the bench, get in the game and getstuff done. Charles Marcus does a magnificent job of providingall three of the ""missing pieces"" - inspiration, motivation, andmost important of all, clarity about how to get started.If you want something revolutionary (don't we love anything thatis ""new and improved?"") this isn't it. Marcus simply lays outa practical, powerful plan for doing the things we all knowwe need to do to clarify our goals, develop effective actionsteps, and then get going. Buy and read this book, but moreimportanty, plan to keep it on your desk and read it againand again as a gentle and helpful reminder to do what youknow you ""should"" be doing. It's fun, it's helpful, it willmake a difference. Highly recommended!"
4,Great educational toy!,"My 3 yr-old got this for Christmas, and he really enjoys it. He already knows his letter sounds, and we thought this would help him with the corresponding letter names and starting to form words for pre-reading skills. He really likes using the toy, although it is most effective when we sit and have one-on-one time with him while he uses it, so we can help him stay focused - a tough task for any 3 year old! It is also great to take in the car, as it is just the right size to hold in their lap. We wanted to encourage him in his interest of letters and reading but still keep it fun, and this toy helps! We also purchased the next toy Sizzle makes (Get Ready to Read Activity System for ages 4-7), so that as soon as he is ready we can get that out - it is even more interactive."
4,A nice save for the series,"Picking up literally where the first book (Hardwired) left off, the author manages to tell twice the story in half the pages. The action is well paced, expertly described and easy to read without being overly-simple. Character development is smooth and natural. Taken by itself, It's no masterpiece, but I'm glad to give it a place on my bookshelf. Taken by comparison to the first book, it's on par with a lost work of Tolkien, or a good Michael Crichton story. If you're looking into reading this series, this book makes forcing your way through the first book worthwhile in order to get the whole picture."
1,mislabeled,The image designated is not the book in which was sent to me. I was dissapointed because I really wanted to read what was pictured. Oh well.
3,Madden or 2K?,"First let me say I have always played the 2k football games, now sadly they are not available thanks to EA buying the rights to everything!!! So what choice do you have other then madden? The graphics are good but the play calling is pretty bad, hard format and all of the buttons are completely opposite of every football games i've ever played. All in all its not a bad game, but if I had my choice I wouldnt own it.Also My son and I always play on the same team when we play 2k games, sadly madden will not allow you to do that unless there are more than 2 players, he is very dissapointed, so we just play 2k5 on the ps2"
3,A step in the wrong direction...,"Boring commentary by radio broadcaster. No Madden or Michaels anymore. Convoluded and confusing menu navigation. Horrible soundtrack. Gameplay is fun however, and the highlight stick makes it seem more ""hands on."" The button configurations have become extremely advanced and have a hell of a learning curve to get used to. The buttons deviate from previous Maddens, making you have to break old habbits of button-pushing and learn these new configurations. Wonderful hall of fame archives with highlight reels from many Hall of Famers. The main concern is that Madden is no longer calling the game. I can't get over this fact and it is a sign of bad things to come, since now it looks like it is Madden in name only. He actually made the game interesting and comical, and it really sucks not having Madden's commentary. I really hope they bring Madden and Michaels back in '08, or I probably won't buy it again."
4,Safe Steps,"These really are a good idea and work better than you would think. The concept is that there is a small amt of give in the mat so your weight cracks the ice. I stapled one set directly on the wood steps from my deck. My only complaint is that they are not very heavy, so on stairs where they are not tacked down, they WILL blow away."
5,Best Backpack Ever!,"This backpack has already lasted through 1 1/2 school years with my teen son. That is an absolute miracle! It is still in great shape, except where he is dragging it on the floor and ground it is getting a little scuffed up on the bottom. He carries all of his highschool textbooks etc. so he doesn't have to use his locker. It is extremely heavy with all of that in it and I know that is not good for his back but that is his choice. He has truly tested this bag. The straps are nice and cushioned and all of the zippers are working and in good shape. This bag cost us a little more but was well worth it especially when you consider that we used it for 2 school years."
5,Sturdy and exceptionally equipped backpack,"I can see why this backpack is Amazon's number one seller -- it is roomy, sturdy, and has lots of pockets and space for not only a laptop, but anything else you might want to carry.The extra padding makes it extremely comfortable to carry on your back.I've shopped for a pack for weeks in NYC and have not found anything nearly approaching this quality for the price. A real bargain, and I can't wait to use it every day, when I walk, and ride my bike or scooter.Also, I recommend LuggageGuru -- they had the best price, and their customer service was outstanding. They found a pack in the color I wanted and swapped it out for the one ordered online. Even the shipping and tax was less than Macy's (who did not have the color I wanted in stock)."
5,Quality,"I usually buy from L.L. Bean because they have a lifetime replacement warranty on all their products and unsurpassed quality, however my fiancé bought this one and I love it! It is just as sturdy as the L.L. Bean ones (I've only had it for a year though and my L.L. Bean one held up for 15 years) It fits my Laptop 15.4 in, and tons of books or whatever else you need. There is a tiny zipper pocket on the top in between the two big pockets which is perfect for holding keys, wallet, i-Pod and sunglasses which is nice so they won't get crushed on the bottom of the bag.The straps are nice and cushioned so it won't hurt your shoulders. I have used it in the rain and I have never had a problem, however I suspect that if you were to take any school backpack into a downpour things are bound to get a little damp but not soaked. I love it so much I am buying another one."
3,"Nice,but...","The backpack is nice with a lot of room inside. However, there are 6 zippers for separate compartments which is way too much. I do wish that the back compartment could have taken over the next zippered space.It is also quite big. I'm 5'4 and I feel dwarfed by it.Overall, it is good quality and should last me awhile. My laptop fits in nicely too."
2,if they would have little more thought in compartments!!!,"I would have given this bag 4 star if following tiny things would not be so irritating-1) Cup holders- too small. I can still squeeze my regular size water bottle and a coffee cup. But do you want to maneuver it daily 5 times a day to get the bottle out and keep it back?????2) there are two main compartments- one compartment has only one sided zipper and its little small too;3) Another compartment does not open all the way only till half and then zipper is covered by cloth at the top so basically to get your stuff in and out you got to be really careful sometimes your stuff get stuck, sometimes the zipper :-(This bag is everyday struggle; I don't know what all these good reviews are about.Given the money it costs, I don't expect it to be a super duper bag but at least do the basic functions without annoying!!!"
2,WIsh I could like it,"I received this backpack for last Christmas (bought from Amazon). Its a nice backpack, except that the main compartment's zippers stick in 2 areas, making it a hassle to close. I was hoping that if I continued to use it the zippers would begin to loosen and flow more smoothly, however that has yet to happen. Other than this problem, I have no problems with the backpack, but like I said, the whole zipper thing is a pretty big annoyance."
4,Nice,"I like all the pockets. It is very durable, but would be better if I needed to put a laptop in my bag - which I don't. But it fits a few notebooks, folders, textbooks, and books. It only fits about half of my stuff for school, but that's more than my previous backpack! :)"
5,beautiful backpack,I like it very much. The color of the backpack can fit any clothes. There are multi-pockets.Value worth price!
4,Great pack,I bought this for global travel and haven't been disappointed. It has taken a good amount of abuse and is holding up well. The amount of zippers can get a little annoying but overall I've been very happy.
4,Great!,A little heavy but we're not carrying it far. Great zippers and a good price. I would recommend for laptop and etc.
4,Generally great,"This bag has been overall exactly what I expected. Larger than my old bag, but not overwhelming. Lots of pockets for organizing and an easy access laptop compartment. Overall at great product. Only downside is that one of the straps was a little bit torn when I got it. I think it will be fine, and I might patch it later, but it looks a bit like a weed whacker got a little too close to the side edge of one of the straps..."
4,Great Bag,"I love my bag. It's the right size for high school and all the compartmemts will help me organize my stuff. I had researched before buying a backpack and this was my favorite. The only thing is the zippers. Trying to shut the bag requires two hands: one to pull the zipper ad one to push the backpack lining in. Hence my four stars. But if you want a backpack with padding and a laptop pocket, this is for you."
4,great bag,"Lots of great pockets both large and small. tough construction except for one inside pocket, stitching got loose. Good zippers"
4,backpack,"It's really pretty BACKPACK, I like it.. One of my teacher said its really nice and colorful not like other students backpack:)"
1,Horrible.,"This company is terrible. The bag came in a different color then it was perceived in the picture, and the bag wasn't even big enough to carry my supplies. Not a great bag and recommend buying LL Bean products instead their bags are much bigger in carrying supplies."
2,Too heavy,"This review was written by my child who ordered and used the backpack:When I first got it every thing looked good it had enough space I liked the color. But when school started the backpack straps started rubbing my shoulder leaving red patches that hurt. The backpack with only my iPad, sketch pad, and charger made my back arch. Now my back is always arched back like a backbend position. The space is good. I have had the backpack for a year and it has rip marks on the front. The straps hurt and it weighs too much, the color is cute but my backpacks has rip marks. I would NOT recommend this backpack. I hope you find this reveiw helpful!:)"
5,Exactly what I wanted,As a petite woman most laptop bags look and feel huge on me. This backpack is the perfect size for my laptop and all my college books. It is comfortable during my long walks across campus and I never run out of pockets to put anything I may need. I love that it has two side pockets that hold bottled water and umbrellas. I would definetly reccomend this backpack. It seems very sturdy and that It will hold up for many years to come.
3,good but not as functional as I'd like,"I'd really hoped this was going to be an awesome bag. It is nice bag. the straps are comfortable and it's pretty easy to carry. however, it feels like there's no space. the barrier between the main compartments is just onelayer of thin fabric which means everything from the back compartment pushes into the front and vice vera. So whenever I want to take books out or put them in. I have to push all the other stuff out of my way. This is super annoying because I haul alot of books and will have the backpack jammed to capcity. To have to move everythign around just to slide one book back in is frustrating. One major reason, I got this pack was because I wanted to have the extra space of two main compartments. The space is there but it's not very functional. I like the bag but I find myself wondering if it was really worth it. It works but I wouldn't give it five stars."
2,Shoulder Strap Stitches Problem,"After less than 7 months of daily use to work, the stitches started to come off. I only carry a 14 inch laptop, a couple of folders with maybe 10 pages in them, pens and a laptop power cord. This is my second backpack from High Sierra and both had the same problems. I should have learned my lesson on the first one. But no. I'm now shopping for a different brand."
4,nice pack,"I ordered this to use for short trips and as a carry all for events, concerts etc. I have only used it a few times so far, but it seems like a well made, good size bag for the money. One of the zippers is a little hard to zip up all the way but I believe it sticks right at a crease made during shipping. I am going to wash it and see if this loosens things up. I am happy with the bag and would recommend it to others."
3,Zippers don't run well,"The materials used seem to be of good quality; however, the zippers, most likely due to the shape of the openings, don't run smoothly, which makes getting things in and out of the pack a pain, and if you find yourself in a hurry - frustrating. Less important is the design of the pockets, especially the smallest front pocket, which is not as practical as compared to other models from this manufacturer. We have two other High Sierra packs in our household (models without the laptop sleeve) which are considerably more thoughtfully designed and practical to use.Overall, had I been able to put my hands on this pack before purchase, I would not have bought it, because of the zippers. As it is, I'm keeping the pack, use it for its intended purpose, and then relegate it to some secondary use once I find a decent pack to replace it."
4,Looks good on first review,"As plenty of other reviewers have commented, this pack has plenty of pockets/pouches/zippers for anything you can think of. The shoulder straps are thin but transfer the weight well. Only complaint so far is that the zippers are a little tough, they don't open or close smoothly. Not sure if that will improve with use. Other than this issue it seems like a solid, quality pack. It's also not flashy so if you're a little older (no longer in school) you can wear it without looking like a student."
5,Great product,A great bag at low cost. Been using it for months now. The best school bag I have seen. Carries loads of my stuff including my 6 lbs laptop comfortably.
4,love it,"perfect for the college classes I'm taking that requires a lot of textbooks. t is a bit big for my petite body, but it gets the job done. I love it, otherwise!"
4,"Good backpack, minor annoyances","This backpack is big, durable, and comes in a great variety of colors. It fits very comfortably on my back. The only problem I really have with it is that a couple of the openings that you unzip have a lining that partially blocks that side. So even if you unzip it all the way, you have to reach up and around the lining to get into that pocket. Not a big deal, but can be annoying. Among other very minor annoyances is the existence of a tiny and very unnecessary pocket at the top of the bag, that just serves to confuse which zipper you are suppose to be using. Along the same lines, the back opening has two separate zippers for the same opening which seems very redundant and just adds to the zippers you have keep figuring out until you get used to it.But like I said these are very minor grievances and it is all in all a very good product."
5,Great quality backpack,"High Sierra is seriously, a well made product. It suits my needs and is very comfortable and durable. Stylish as well! There's a lot of storage available in it. Very well thought out design."
2,Disappointed,The first one I received feel apart at the seems after only 3 days of having it. Then I received a second one and the zipper tracks on 2 of the openings are hard to zip and unzip. I feel like anytime now the zippers are going to break.
5,This bag surprises me on a daily basis.,Amazing backpack. There are so many compartments that I secretly unlocked the door to Narnia by unzipping one of front pockets :D
3,bit heavybut functional,"Pros:Very comfortable (straps are nice, after slight adjustment the whole bag when loaded with laptop and books is comfortable to carry)Not too big.Seems durable (2 months of use)Lots of medium sized compartments (good and bad read below).Good value for moneyCons:Slightly heavy even when empty.Lots of compartments - perhaps too many big/medium compartments.No separation of laptop and main compartment - annyoing, have another backpack where the laptop compartment is separate, this bag has two separate zippers but leading to one compartment (didn't make sense) - and this one compartment isn't as convinient as two separate compartments.The zippers are stiff (smooth but stiff) not a big deal again annoying.Overall good backpack but annoying to use."
2,"Very attractive, but too poorly designed","Very attractive with lots of space, but not very functional (at least for me).Pros>Very attractive (I purchased the B/W plaid)>Very spacious>Very many pockets>Very protective laptop pocketCons>~2-3lb hard insert between back padding and laptop area really adds weight>Non removable buckle in main compartment gets in the way of everything and designed just so, that you cannot slide anything in the back (going to cut off if keeping it)>Most pockets are too deep for use with most small things you need pockets for (cellphones, ipods, pens, etc.)>Only accessible shallow pocket is made with really cheap non-reinforced polyester>VERY rough material used for shoulder/neck area, DO NOT WEAR WITH TANK-TOP (otherwise, expect serious rug burn where-ever there is contact"
4,Great bag,"Great bag, I can see the quality in the zipper. Love all the various compartments. I would given it five stars if the padding on the shoulder straps were a little bit more for comfort. It seems like that was the only area they went low end. But I would recommend it if your not a big comfort strap buyer."
3,Zipper problems,"This bag is very comfortable on the back and shoulders. It is not that roomy but has alot of compartments. I can only put my labtop, a text book and a binder in the bag, but the many compartments allows me to organized my phone, wallet and keys. It also has another compartment that I put my sandwich in and it wouldn't squish. The only really bad thing is the zippers don't zip as smoothly as any other zippers I have."
4,Under $50,"Great backpack, liked the feel of the fabric, felt better than comparable Jansport, has more space and pockets. Hold up well."
