5,Very Realistic.. Easy Read!,"The characters are easy to realate to. As you are reading you feel like you are really experiencing the events that happen. When you start reading it you can't set the book down. Then, when you finish reading it you feel like you have lost a good friend. It's a must read!"
4,Good Night Maman,"Good Night Maman is a historical fiction novel about a young girl fighting for her life in th German War. Young Karin Levi, travels through Venice, Italy and many other countries. While travelingshe finds a girl who tells her there is a ship leaving for America taking refugees. karin and her brother Marc, eventually arrie to the ship, as they et sail to America. Karin mees many boys and girls her age while visiting America.Norma Fox Mazer is an exquisit author that I would probably recommendfor children i grades 6-8. This bok contains good details to help you visualize the truths of all the lives taken, by the Nazi's in the German War. I like this book because, it is very exciting ad is quite an exciting and yet suspenseful tory, that i couldn't put down."
4,Loved the book,I first read this book when I was in the 7th grade for a book report....I'm now 21 and have been trying to remember the title of this book for so long because I loved it! It's such a good book because the characters are believable and you can feel their true emotions. read it!
5,good night maman,this book good night maman is one of the best books i have read i just can't keep my eye's off it!!! this book it about the holocoust and it is where they have to give up every thing they own and run and hide from the german soilders because they invated there country and said that jews were very different and that they weren't regular people and so they got limited from every thing the people who weren't jews could do!but everyone should give this book a chance because this is a book i can not take my eye's off of!
3,Book Report,This is a good book. I like the way it feels like its is true (in real life)!IT'S GREAT!
4,Good start,"Ready to read the second book. So far so good.Worth the money. Go ahead, buy it. Nice take on computers."
5,Grim realities of life and death on the battlefield,"Engagingly written by Don Meyer (a combat veteran of the Vietnam War), The Protected Will Never Know is a revealing memoir of the horrors of a grueling war that oppressed not only one's physical life, but also one's spirit. The grim realities of life and death on the battlefield are not abridged in this compelling firsthand testimony showcases in a collection of personal stories based on Meyer's ""in country"" time from 1969 to 1970. The Protected Will Never Know is a welcome contribution to the increasing library of Vietnam War combat biographies, military autobiographies, and battlefield memoirs."
5,Wonderful Movie,"I love this movie - yes, it is dubbed into English - Italian film - but it is well done and has tense moments - not for young people under 17 - but a must for people who love the old slow moving zombie movies.Larry V"
4,Zombi 2,"This is one of my favourite zombie films. I like how old rotten the zombies look. The gore effects was pretty good for it`stime. I think the music by another favourite composer of mine Fabio Frizzi is pretty good. I like the main theme.Picture quality: 4/5This looks very much improved compared to my old Anchor Bay DVD from 98. The colours, details, blood & gore looksmuch better now due to it being restored in 2K. There is 1 problem, though. The film grain. This has over use of DNR andproblems with noise which have mostly replaced the film grain. I think it looks too smooth and waxy in places. Poor decision touse so much DNR. At least it looks much better than my DVD.Audio quality: 4/5The English dub in: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 sounds pretty good compared to my DVD. Although, the music at timessounds a bit thin and hollow. Some good bass did i hear from the guns.Film: 4/5Overall: 4/5"
1,Zombie movie?,"You call this a Zombie movie? This movie stinks! I figured I'd better sit through this bomb, since I paid good money for it.Maybe my local pawn shop will give me a couple bucks for it."
5,Most used cookbook in my collection,"Love this book. I've had it for years now and I still go back to it for yummy, unique and healthy dishes, especially the salads."
5,Earth Shattering with a twist of Volcano!!,I love how the book starts out right where it begins unlike other series. Terry gives excellent personal background where it is soo good you almost despise the Sisters! There is nothing like this book and all the others by Terry it seems that no matter what Kahlan and Richard just can't be at peace. It seems that excellent wording is the key and terry is in another plane of exsitance
3,Mild Attachment,"I'm only mildly attached to this series. I'm enjoying it but I wouldn't miss it if I never read any further than this one. Finally in Stone of Tears I began to develop an attachment to some of the characters. Without that attachment, I have a difficult time engrossing myself in the tale. My hope is that I enjoy each additional one a little more than the last. I would love to love this long series."
4,Another wonderful read from a fantastic author,I loved Stone of Tears. The story is gripping and full of interesting twists and turns. Magic and swords... magic swords... and war. Let's not forget the war. Read it!
5,The best book in an exceptional series!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It took right off where Wizards First Rule ended, and continued to capture my attention. Total action from beginning to end, like the rest of the series! I thought this one was the best (so far) in the series because you really get to know the characters better in this, the second book. Terry Goodkind has made me a fan of Fantasy when I thought I never would be. I highly recommend this book, and even though each book is written to stand alone, I suggest you start at the beginning of the story of Richard, Kahlan, Zedd and the others in Wizards First Rule."
3,Too Dark and gloomy for a perfect read,"Although the plot was very well designed, and the characters very well fleshed out, something about the way goodkind writes seems to cast a pall over the whole book. Not a very enjoyable effect Although he hadn't been the cheeriest of authors in Wizard's First Rule, somehow he got worse. Still, if not easily downheartened by the general despair, it is a very good book to read. I finished it in one continuous span of reading, just watch out for how your feeling at the end!"
3,Fair to partly cloudy with scattered sunlight,I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this book.T. Goodkind lost the art of combining dialog withhorrifying violence with a purpose going toward an unforseenyet sensible outcome. His characters just went a little nuts.It seemed like the ending was disjointed and left alot of details out that needed to be there. I hope TG getsback on track with the finale.
2,MY GRADE: C minus to C.,A huge disappointment after the first novel. I got through about half of this novel (hundreds of pages) before I felt all the meandering of the main tale and the love story were making the tale bland. After my glowing review of his first book I reluctantly gave up on this one and the rest of the series. OVERALL GRADE: C minus to C; WHEN READ: 2001 (reviewed early April 2012).
3,Worth Reading,"Just finished reading Stone of Tears, and it is definitly middle of the pack. The books are well written, and are entertaining. However, the swiping of ideas from Brooks and Jordan are pretty common. Any reasonable person has to admit the book lacked originality. Darken Rahl being Richard's father was the worst(Luke, I am your father. Noooooo! Ben, no wait I mean Zedd, why didn't you tell me.) Overall, worth reading while you are in between other books."
4,Another Great book inthe sword of truth series,"Have you ever read a series where you can just tell that the author is making it up as he goes along? This is NOT one of those. The detail of the storyline is fantastic. The characters are full and the storyline is impeccably thought out. I love the nuances and the small curves in the storyline that oftentime become huge plot twists! These are weighty tomes at almost 1000 pages in paperback form, and I looked forward to every word. Thanks to Mr. Goodkind for fulfilling this reader's want for a full-bodied detail rich, but never tedious book"
3,Kindle Edition Needs Work,"The plot was good. My biggest problem is the constant misspellings. I am a good reader and read about one book per week. This book had a lot of ""that"" when they meant ""than"". Also there were a lot of mix ups between ""they"" and ""then"". As a good reader I substituted to keep the meaning, but a poor reader would get lost in the incorrect words. It looks like someone did a find and replace and replaced more words than they expected. Because of the constant wrong words I had to rate it a three. Maybe someone will fix it soon. Because the wrong words are actually words themselves, it won't word to do a spell check. It will take some proofreading."
4,Nice,"Condition was as stated and it arrived very quickly. I appreciate that it stated book #2 because I was having a hard time keeping track and other posts did not specify which book # within the series. I now have almost the entire series, thanks to amazon!"
2,Jordan without character or plot development,"Robert Jordan must be furious if he's read any of the Book of Truth series. It is astonishing how many similarities there are between Stone of Tears and Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Between the Aes Sedai and the Sisters of the Light. Between the Black Sedai and the Sisters of the Dark. Oh, I could go on, but why bother? Terry Goodkind's series just isn't worth the effort. Why? Because unlike Jordan, Goodkind has not told a real story. Instead of developing the plot, so that events that occur throughout the novel lead, inextricably, to the conclusion, Goodkind simply lays out events which finally and inexplicably run to the conclusion. Nor are the characters developed in the way that Jordan develops his, so that by the end of the second volume in the Wheel series, we understand who Rand, Mat, and the other characters are. Ultimately, Stone of Tears seemed amateurish and childish -- a not uncompelling story poorly told."
5,A Great Sequel,An easier to read and darker alternative from the wheel of time for someone looking for an epic fantasy series to bite into.
3,Don't want to pay for an UNEDITED kindle book.,"I have enjoyed the story line and creativity of the author, BUT I am VERY disappointed in the lack of editing. This kindle book is filled with hundreds, HUNDREDS, of spelling/editing errors. The editors, if they exist, don't know the difference between that and than, or affect and effect. I DO NOT WANT TO PAY FOR ANOTHER BOOK THAT IS NOT EDITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Nothing like Wizard's First Rule,"I like Goodkind, the next book after this is good and his first was top notch.This novel is about 500 pages of painful dreck, for example. Richard will go on for pages about how much he misses Kahlan and Kahlan will in turn do the same thing. I understand they are deeply in love but you don't need to beat that dead horse anymore, I got the first hundred times it was irritatingly mentioned.Secondly, the main problem of the novel is wrapped up in the last 50 pages."
1,"Damaged book labeled ""new""","Without question the worst seller I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I purchased three books each from a different seller. The first was an older book but was obviously never read or opened. The second was a very new print. This one however was printed the same time as the first but there was a book mark in it, the spine was worn, the back of the book was bent and some of the page corners where folded or dented. Did I mention the moisture damage? So I asked for an actual new one. Turns it was the only book she had. I was told to send the book back in the packages that she sent the book in. Unfortunately the package she sent it in was a plastic bag from Fedex and no other packaging. It could not be resealed and I did not want her to blame me for any of the damage so I had to ship it back myself. I was only refunded my original purchase and was not refunded the return shipping nor has she responded to my last email."
4,Can't Put Down,"Even though this book has a crazy amount of typos (kindle version) i could not put this book down. It was not as good as Wizards First Rule but it was pretty d*mn good. This book you meet the sisters of the light and the sisters of the dark and what I like most about the Terry Goodkind series is his books definitely take you to another world! This is a great and fun escape into the midlands. One thing I don't like about a lot of fantasy novels is they can be somewhat hard to read because the author is taking themselves too seriously or describing things so much you forget what is going on, you don't have to take ridiculous english classes to understand the writing in this series. And it makes it for a very fun and enjoyable read! i want to read this whole series!"
3,"Not great, but better than its predecessor","A much better piece of work than WFR. Much more focused. The dialogue is a bit weak, and the characters are somewhat inconsistent. Also, some of the sexual refernces are a bit adolescent. Furthermore, why would a woman over 100 years old behave like a young, teen-aged girl? Addtionally, some of the obstacles that the protagonist must surmount are overcome rather easily. If you thought the ending to book 1 was brief and anti-climatic, this was was even more so. Still, it was an ok read. Hopefully, book three will be even better."
5,A great read!!!,"You can not put this book down. I can't wait for more of his books come out. I loved it. If you know of a fifth book coming out, please e-mail me and tell me what you know."
4,Definitely worth the read!,"This book is definitely worth the read. There's enough action and subplots to satisfy just about anyone, and Richard and Kahlan were fleshed out more in this book. Since I don't have much time to sit back and enjoy a good read, I listen to unabridged audio books whereever possible. Dick Hill, the reader of this book, does a wonderful job of narrating the book with the appropriate pace to match the activity in the book, and a variety of voices to differentiate between the characters. I'm looking forward to reading the Blood of the Fold!"
4,Felt like a roller-coaster ride,"The longest part of a roller-coaster ride is the climb to the top. The majority of this book was the climb to the top. There was some good points. The part with Richard shooting with the mud people was interesting. The thng I didnt like about this book was when richard solved all of this problems in about 5 pages (not actually, that's the way it felt). But it was a pretty good sequel. I will still read the rest of the series."
1,Biggest mistake of my reading life,"I hated the first book. However, I was promised the second book was much better. I was lied to. The subpoena's are currently being served.All bad jokes aside, The story was a bit better. There were moments of the book I really enjoyed. Yet there were also points in the story that made me feel like putting my head in an oven. The main character's slow transformation into a giant baby kicks into high gear in this book. His feigned respect for other people's feelings and beliefs that he had in the first book is thrown right out the window in the sequel. Richard spends most of the book threatening to kill innocent people while claiming he was in the right. The ending of the book seemed improvised and rushed to say the least. There were several segments of the plot that weren't expanded on nor explained. Terry Goodkind seemed set on keeping the book under the 1000 page mark.Please. Don't read this book without having first put a dunce cap over your head."
1,Review of Kindle Edition,"The story is good. Just don't buy a Kindle version. The second and third books in the series, I have not read beyond that, are difficult to read because of simple, gross editing mistakes. Grammatical, spelling, punctuation and pagination errors throughout the book make it difficult to read and considerably less enjoyable despite a wonderful story. I love to read using a Kindle; I am just shocked at such a lack of quality control. I hope it is not a trend. So buy or borrow the books and enjoy a good story. Just don't get them on the Kindle."
1,Seriously I want a refund,I got Wizard's First Rule on Kindle and it was great. However this book is atrocious it appears to have been formatted by a 1st grader. I am very displeased I hope that amazon fixes it and gives a free update to people who bought this version. I am actually mad about it.
1,Terry Goodkind's stone of tears,"Oh dear, oh dear, where did it all go wrong Terry? What a pity,when the first book was quite good this book is just pure unfilteredcrude &@*!$. Terry plunders every cliche known to man and doesnt seem to have his own writing style. The way Kahlen and Richard kept apologising to each other at every available opportunity smacked to me of an author who can't write a decent line of dialog or of line wasting. Terry is deeply preoccupied with physical violence and uses it at every opportunity to shock the reader. The ending was the most contrived i've read in years! Terry conspires to forget about the plot for the whole book until the last 10 pages where he tries to squeeze it all in! It just doesn't work! Poor show Terry. END"
3,disappoint in quality of kindle version,"While the storyline continues to be very good, the number of bad grammar and spelling errors were quite distracting. By book four, this seems to be corrected to a large degree."
3,knight,"Now let me get this straight:1- Kaylen loves Richard.2- Richard hates wearing the Rada'Han to the point where he feels betrayed.3- Kaylen believes that without the Rada'Han, Richard will die so she makes him wear it and is told that if she does in fact love him, that she must go find Zed who may be able to help Richard's headaches without him wearing the collar.4- Kaylen believes that Richard MUST survive as he is the only one that can repair the veil.So, off Kaylen goes to find Zed..yet she goes off track to check out Ebinissia and takes over an army?Ah, what happened to the great pain and fear of her love? What happened to the fact that ONLY Richard can save the entire universe?"
2,Vulgar,"I liked the first book, but after getting 1/3 through this book i found i could not continue. The book was simply too vulgar. It started talking about 'getting your hand up girls skirts' and it simply turned me off. Not the kind of thing i want to read about in a book. I wish to read a good book, and save sex for the internet, not in my book."
5,Amaaazing,"Terry Goodkind is the GREATEST writter for all times, his novels are amazing, and every book from sowrd of the truth is better than the one before. it's simply AMAZING"
5,The series should never end!!!!!,"This book is da bom! When I read this sequel, I felt like my everyday life was plain boring and the life of Richard Rahl and Kahlan Amnell is LIFE!!! The most amazing part about the book was when Kahlan was ordering the army around. It is hard to imagine that women are treated the same way in the book as they were in the 50' and stuff. This book should get a prize or something better."
5,maybe my favorite Sword of truth novel,"very good book. its that simple. long and good i wish #7 and 8 had been this good-read other reviews of these books for longer thoughts about these books- ok i may go into some detail- very good book be cause this book is all creation- the whole book is furthering the plot of the series definetly worth reading- some people are turned of by books that are just under a thousand pages- don't be this book is worth the effort to read and you will enjoy it- if you don't enjoy it at least you don't know where i live... oh wait you do, well not my address at least... hahahahaha ok thats enough"
4,Awesome!!!,"This sequel was excellent. Sometimes a little drawn out , but a great adventure. Definitely worth the read! Hard to put down!"
4,Stone of Tears,"l like the book fine other than the spelling errors and the questions the charictors had that they already knew the answer to but for some reason didn't. For instance, could zed helpRichard instead of the sisters? He knew but somehow didn't. True Seeker? IDK"
4,Fun read. Though nothing mind blowing.,"A good fun read and follow up to Wizard First Rule.The story starts moving right out of the gate getting right to the action. It slows down a bit towards the middle and I found myself frustrated Witt some of the choices by the characters even though in the end they seemed to be reasoned.My only issue with the sorry was the ending seemed a bit rushed. Lost of time for development and creating a set of problems for out hero, Richard Rahl to solve. Then suddenly, with a couple of quick decisions they are solved and the story is as an end.Even with my issues, the characters and the setting remain interesting and I will continue to read the series."
2,"If you have read WOT, you already know the story.","Let me start off by saying this book is pretty decent in it's own right. However, I have to agree with Jim's list of similarities. There are just way too many parallels for me to reccommend this book. It wouldn't surprise me if Goodkind wrote this book using Robert Jordan's notes."
3,uhhhhhh..........does this go somewhere?,"OK book, but slow plot. Goodkind needs to get a thinking cap or something"
3,"An ok story, but not as good as the first","I am currently on the 4th book of the series, and up to this point I have to say that this is the worst. Not bad but not good either. When reading I kept wondering when we were going to get to the Stone and it's meaning. I was dissapointed in the amount of time it actually recieved. I hope this is only a fluke, and that the rest of the series will be as good as the first book."
4,"Ok, book worth the buy","A good book with well developed charactors, and impressive magic, and with good fights that you could follow along with. Bad things... The book builds to a grand ending and ends within a chapter or less."
2,"Lacks detail, not worth the money","I bought this book hoping that it would be as wonderful as the Jordan series from which this author borrows heavily. What is so disappointing is that this book is merely a detailed outline that the author has failed to embellish. What I got from Jordan's books, Kathryn Rusch's Fey series and George R. R. Martin's books were fully developed characters and plots. I was able to fully immerse myself in a new world and believe that world existed. Goodkind, while writing a good yarn, has failed to make the characters interesting, has failed to describe the countryside. I have no idea what sort of trees grow there, what the mountains look like, what clothing the people wear, what the native food tastes like. I am left with a one-dimensional story that while promising, should never have been released without the detail to make it come alive."
3,Enjoyable but certainly not original,"I actually found Goodwind's second book quite dark in places with the rape/torture repeated themes, however overall the book was quite enjoyable. The similarities with Robert Jordan's wheel of time extend into almost every area of the plot. right down to the Sisters of light being on an Island, the warder type cloak, the term 'novice' etc etc etc however the great thing about Goodkind is that he wraps up most of the loose ends by the end of his books. This means the books can be enjoyed on their own, being a story in themselves. Overall I've enjoyed reading the series so far and plan to continue reading them all."
5,"Move over Ali , Looks like Terry Goodkind is the greatest!!!","When I read thru WFR I became panic striken by the preveiw for SOT. I spent the whole night worrying ""Oh my God , Whats he going to do poor Kahlan !!!"". Thank the maker I bought SOT the next day and finished it in the week. I thought it lost some of the pace of the first novell but it was still very good book. Mr. Goodkind has a way of making you feel like your right there in the story"
3,A satisfactory sequel to Goodkind's first novel,"While Goodkind blew all other books of this genre out of the water with Wizard's First Rule, the second book in the series was not as stellar. It provides a certain satisfaction to readers who were left hanging after the first novel, and ups the stakes for Richard Rahl by threatening him with more minions of the ruler of the Underworld. This book is another page turner and well written, but a little disappointing after reading the first in the series. Let's put it this way: it doesn't leave you dying to read the third book."
4,"Better than his first book, but still totally unoriginal. .","This is a good book to read if, and only if you can find nothing else that looks interesting. I do believe this book was a little better than his first, but his story is so predictable--especially since I've already read most of it in other series written by better authors (Robert Jordan for example). Goodkind's characters still get on my nerves too. Especially Richard and Kahlan's annoying behavior. When real life people are in love, they are nowhere near as sappy as Goodkind makes those two characters. It makes me want to puke. But still, if you've already read all of Jordan or whoever is your favorite author's work, but have nothing else to read until their next story comes out, then this book works just fine as a time fille"
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!,"Goodkind is a fraud!!!! I read the first book and hated the first three quarters, then the last quarter caught my interest. I then decided to buy the next book, and was thoroughly dissapointed. The main character Richard is a Jesus like character that can do no wrong. He is the god of every tribe he comes into contact with, he is the main focus of every prophesy ever written, he can do just about everything better than everyone else in the book. The dialogue is also very childish. I really would like the time I spent reading this garbage BACK!!!!!"
1,They publish books that are this bad?,"This book was horrible. I'd say it's even worse than the first book, but that's pointless. Goodkind doesn't have a single original thing in this book-- characters, plot twists, bad guys. The violence is just too much to be believed, the writing is the worst I've ever read, and the plot... well, that is even worse than his previous novel. I'm still hitting myself over the head for making myself READ this."
1,"Yeah, you're right...","Goodkind is balderdash. Aside from not having anyideas of his own, he can't write fit for s**t.Nor can he plot, nor can be build characters. Some day, all these teenagers who love him will (hopefully) grow up and see how utterly stupid Goodkind's books are."
3,"Pretty good, but Book 1 was better","Stone of Tears, Terry Goodkind's 2nd installment in his Sword of Truth series, was a fairly good book although Wizard's First Rule was better. While Goodkind's writing style has matured quite a bit since his debut, Wizard's First Rule, he has sacrificed the constant action that made book 1 so exciting. The plot is deeper, but moves at a snails pace for most of the book. As many others have said before, it picks up dramatically towards the end, perhaps too much. The novel is highly inconsistent to this end. However the storyline still held my interest despite all these flaws. I found it to be a decent book worth your reading if you have nothing better to read at the time."
2,Abundant Typos,This is an excellent book. It is very well written and the story pulls you in. The only trouble with this book is that there are an overwhelming number of typos. Every single instance of 'than' is replaced with 'that'. Incorrect usage of a/an is common and extra or missing words are on almost every single page. It is incredibly jarring to be reading and encounter a few (1-5) typos per book. This is unacceptable. The only reason I gave two stars was because it is otherwise very well written.
1,Stole ideas from Robert Jordan,"TG blatantly stole from WOT. The example are legion. To begin with, there is the striking similarity between female wielders of power, the Aes Sedai and the Sisters of the Light. Plus, each has a dark, secret sect amongst them: Black Ajah vs. Sisters of the Dark. There is also the fact that male users of the power suffer and eventually die if they don't find ways to get their power under control. Add to this, Stone of Tear vs. Stone of Tears, the use of collars to subdue magic use, Caracarn vs. Caharan, sword forms used by blade wielders, ageless female users of the Power, etc. Oh, and don't forget Children of the Light vs. Blood of the Fold.It is actually patent and obvious when you look at publication dates that Goodkind ripped off many concepts and terms from Jordan, nearly whole cloth."
2,Not as good as the first,The story is not as well weaved and reads somewhat like a romance novel...where the last story left off with the hero more confident he is plunged for most of the book into tired whining about relationship issues. Instead of wasting time with the author should have connected all the sub-story lines together. I am undecided if I will read more in this series.
3,ehh well,"great story, nice plot, superb characters and wonderfully annoying typos. its seriously so annoying it takes away from the story. i dont think you are supposed start a new paragraph every line."
2,Stolen ideas still can't make the grade,"I have been a long time fan of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and also of Goodkind's 1st book in this series, Wizard's First Rule. Imagine my suprise when I picked up this novel expecting another smash hit and instead got Jordan re-runs! Every detail matches Jordan's books but with different names, especially the final sequence with the dark sisters-almost word for word with a specific part in the Wheel of Time books. I can't believe that there isn't a lawsuit in progress over this. I have never been so disappointed in my life. This series started out very strong and then this. What a waste of good talent. People...read Robert Jordan-at least his characters are powerful, beautifully written and ORIGINAL."
1,Garbage and 1/2,Guess old Terry didn't learn his lessonwith the first book: he can't write as wellas a monkey could in his position. He really needs some grammar and style courses.
3,Who edited this mess???,I really like the author Terry Goodking's style but Amazon should really be ashamed to sell a book with so many typos & editing mistakes. Somebody should get their shit togeather and hire a decent editor and/or proofreader. Any review that gives this mess five stars has to be a paid review.
5,Great Book,"Terry Goodkind definitely kept me engaged the whole time. I loved the first book and so rushed into this, but I cannot say that I was disappointed!"
2,What happened to proof reading?,"The story was fantastic I liked the first book of the series, but it is a very hard read when the, they, them, or a, am, an are mixed up in the writing of the story. At times I would have to read a sentence 2 or 3 times to get the point. I do hope there is a rewrite of this book in the future it has a good story."
3,"better than I could do, at any rate","Not a bad read. As other reviewers have said, it is a bit long and boring at times. Tighter editing would have solved that problem. The book could have been half the size and much better. Good bits: Well drawn characters who become almost real to one. I could see them all in my mind, and I too was moved to tears sometimes. Bad bits: Sloppy editing leaves too much slush in the story. And the violence. Please! Way too much, and sooo unnecessary. I have got an imagination, and don't need it all spelt out."
1,This was awful!,"I'm sorry but this book left little to be read. There was no suspense in the book at all because they kept talking about the ""prophecies"" and you knew exactly what was going to happen. There are a few scenerios that are extremely sick in theme and should have been left out. also, Richard and Kalan should have starred in a Harlequin Romance after this was written."
1,Stupid is as stupid writes,"Don't waste time on Goodkind--read everything else hecopies from: Jordan, Eddings, Lucas, Brooks."
2,Publisher errors in Kindle Format destroys a great series of books.,"I own the paper back books of the entire Sword of Truth series and beyond. The books are absolutely some of my favorites. That is the BOOKS and not the kindle issue. Error after Error after Error. Spelling mistakes and mistakes in wrong words used greatly annoys me, seeing that these errors happen several times per page. It disrupts the flow of reading. These errors were not made in the paper back books, they were made during the conversion to Kindle. Whomever proof read before publishing obviously was not interested in there job."
3,Good adventure but a bit too much rape,The sexual undertones get to be annoying. Some parts would have been much better without them. A woman would never ride a horse nude into battle in the winter.
3,No indents on Kindle version,"I have not yet finished the book. But im about one hundred pages, and there are no indents. Its not too bad when your reading, but its kind of hard find your place if you get distracted or stop, and sometimes in dialog intense parts, you lose track of who is talking."
1,Birds of a Feather...,"The only thing more saddening than Goodkind's abysmal writing style, unrealistic and childish world and stereotypical characters seems to be the apparent legions of fans who proclaim him as the best thing since sliced bread (which, I suppose, would be correct if that is your perspective. Sigh. I just hope no other publishers will put forth similar drivel to cash in on the indiscriminate market of escapist pulp fantasy."
4,A little Heavy on the Torture Descriptions,"While the story remains intriguing, the lengthy detail of torture was a little much for me - and I'm not usually one to shy away from violence. Ended up skimming and then skipping a couple of torture scenes because I had the picture 20 pages before the description stopped."
3,Plot to remember,Another great plot that is must read. It not one best of the 13 terry goodkind novels but still is good read. The story is just after the first novel wizard 1st rule. In the novel Richard life well take a twist that he fight against and the people forced him into the life. In the course of the novel Richard while become rise another position that destiny has given him. Of course you will learn more of the wizard rules and goodkind morals while meeting another member of Richard family. The excitement continues with every page flip.
4,not g-rated,"I started reading the ""Sword of Truth"" series after watching ""The Legend of the Seeker"" on TV. The series was PG, maybe PG13 for some episodes. The books are R. Great story, great characters, easy to pick up and not put down, but very graphic brutality, gore, and rape. A few cursewords also. I just wanted to make this clear for any parents ;)"
4,Great Follow Up to Wizard's First Rule,"This was a great follow up to the first book and all of the characters I fell in love with were back in this follow up. What I like about the books in this series is there is the master plot that goes across all of the books, while each book on its own is a great read alone."
4,good but it wasnt as good as the first,"This book was very good, but not a great like wizard's first rule. It had a very good story line but the ending was to quick. all in all it was definatly worth reading"
3,Good - but not quite as gripping as Wizard's First Rule,Goodkind should have spent substantialy more time on the ending since it concludes hastily without any of the rich detail he is renowned for. Good - but could have been better.
1,More of the Same,"Book 2 of The Sword of Truth follows squarely in the footsteps of the first. If you loved the first book, you'll probably love this one. If, like me, you thought that the first one was a generic heroic fantasy pastiche with lots of pointless cruelty thrown in, you'll despise this one too.The sad thing is that Goodkind has a fair amount of talent at jerking reactions out of people. I kept reading because I *did* become involved with the characters, and I kept hoping the overall narrative structure would go someplace interesting.Word to the wise: It doesn't."
2,Energizer...,"After a great book like Wizard's First Rule, Terry Goodkind disappoints with this 1000 page flop. It seems that Goodkind stretched the novel to it's limits with about 700 pages. He beat around the bush with lots of bull with them going here and there, and not actually doing what was important. Kahlan was especially disappointing. When in need of figuring how to fix the viel, saving 5000 men means nothing when the world is at stake. I was sorrily upset with this 980 page book. I expected something more than maybe 250 pages of useful writing."
1,I expected better.,This book was boring. The first few chapters kept my attention but soon I was getting tired of reading Richard and Khalan cry again and again. in fact it was rather annoying. All they seemed to do was whine which made me wonder what they were. Powerful heroes of this story plot or helpless children who feel the need to moan about everything from spilled water to death. I expected MUCH more from this book but it just turned out to be a very big dissappointment. I don't even bother to read any of Goodkind's novels anymore.
1,I could not bear to finish this one....,"I really enjoyed the first volume in this series. There were one or two places where I winced at the obvious ""borrowing"" of characters and concepts from other fantasy series, but there was a lot of creativity there to counterbalance those minor lapses.I cannot say the same about this second volume. I was shocked at concept after concept that appeared to have been lifted directly from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, shifted slightly in context, then placed into Goodkind's storyline.Eventually I became too distracted by the large amounts of ""borrowed"" material to be able to enjoy the creative and original aspects of the story (which were less in evidence here than in the first volume), so I am sending this one off to the used book store -- unfinished."
1,Too Many Errors to Make an Enjoyable Read,"I have read the previous hard and soft copy reprinting(s) but have never been so embarassed for a publisher as during my time reading the kindle version of this novel. Nearly every page contains errors such as duplicate words (as as, to to, etc.) as well as errors such as I instead of it, or you instead of your. The proof reader should be shot (or at least look for a different line of work)."
1,I've read fanfiction with less errors...,"I would give the novel itself four stars. Not as good as Wizard's First Rule, but still quite decent.The kindle version, however, should get zero stars. The amount of errors in the book is just... laughable. I counted roughly FIFTY grammatical and spelling mistakes scattered around, along with an entire section completely out of place. Obviously, there was no proofreading done whatsoever. The frequency of such errors became distracting after a while, and I spent more time marking the mistakes than I did concentrating on the actual plot.Honestly, I have seen better care taken with fanfiction."
1,The Pain Continues in Book 2,"Stone of Tears continues where the first book left off. The style is pretty much the same, only (even) slower. I was hoping this would be better than the first, but it was even worse. If you liked the first book, then you will probably like this one too. Its just as amateurish as The Wizard's First Rule."
3,It's ok,"This book borrows just a little to heavily from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time debacle for my taste (even down to the smoothing of skirts, if you can believe that).On top of that, it's becoming a tad predictable, depending on how much of the genre you've read. The idea that it goes on for seven more books is a little frightening to me if this is the tone that's being set for the series this early.Again, depending on how much of the genre you've read, this is an enjoyable read if you're not expecting any ground-breaking ideas or direction, or a break in formula, and just looking for a fun book."
1,Goodkind = Nausea,"""Oh, I love you, Kahlan,"" - ""Oh, I love you, Richard!""Jeesh. Make me puke while you're at it, Terry. Thisbook was written mostly for horny teenagers and has little for the mature pallet."
1,...And I thought he might improve!,"I thought Goodkind might improve on his second book--but, ifanything, he's gotten worse: the storyline is even morepredictable than in the first, the characters have become the Lords of Cliche (as if they could have gotten any thinner), and the style is even more bloated and irrelevent. It's as if he sat down and TRIED to write a book with every contrived device any fantasy author has ever put down on the page--as is, without making them his own in any way. A real master of low-grade hackmanship."
1,Not worth anything,"I've purchased informative, worthwhile digital downloads from Amazone before, but this isn't one of them.This is totally worthless. I expected a review of Microsoft's CRM product. Instead, the ""article"" barely filled one browser screen, and was little more than a typical press release of new products in the pipeline.Don't bother!"
5,A truly great book.,"This is one of the few truly great Buddhist books ever published in English. It would be hard to improve upon, and there will be no need for anyone to try their hand at this again in the future unless the English language changes substantially. The subject matter is sublime, a large collection of the original sutra teachings of Buddha, and the translators are the best in their field, scholar-practitioners with a long history of producing the clearest writings in this difficult field. And simply as a book it is of the highest quality, with exceptional binding, quality paper and excellent typesetting. You can't go wrong here."
5,pristine,the realistic theravadan buddhism . this is a very big book and you cannot finish it in a month ...-to enjoy this book you must intuitivly understand the spirit of buddhism .mahayana buddhism has supermen complexthey run before learning to walk .before you begin trying save the world save yourself .
5,The Best Translation of Middle Length Discourses,"Once I see this book, I bought a few copies irregardless of the price! This book is a beautiful printout and appears in lucid modern english. In finding texts containing middle length discourses of Lord Buddha, besides this book we find the ones of Pali Text Society which is in old english language. This book is appealing to modern readership because of its better typeset and readable translation. I recommend it to anyone seriously in search of the original teachings of the Lord Buddha. This book is a very authentic and it is of high historical value. Meditators will not want to go without it."
4,How to Change the World-Great Foundation,"I personally believe this is a great book for any individual who is interested in the field of social entrepreneurship or for one who wants to learn more about this emerging field. Since the term social entrepreneurship is a fairly new topic, Bornstein provides a great foundation for those interested in the topic by giving detailed examples of real life success stories in the field. It was perfect for the individual, like myself, who wanted a solid foundation about non profits and how they emerged into successful entities. I would suggest it to anyone who believes that working or starting a non profit might be in their near future."
5,"Great mini-stories, case studies.","We read this as one of our books for the Harvard Extension school's Social Entrepreneurship class. It's a great book, very accessible with stories that travel a quick loop around the globe. While broad, it presents emotional and rationale reasons for how to change the world. It is worth your time. It shows how you can make a difference in a community even if you have nothing, e.g. no running water? no electricity? One young man's approach is not only resourceful, but he changes the way his community lives and now the whole country! (I also recommend reading Half the Sky, a wonderful, emotionally upsetting book about injustices in the world that people are trying to right: one singular person at a time -- it makes you jump up onto your feet because you can't sit there doing nothing, you have to do something, and fight back)."
2,Not really about changing the world,"This book has a great title, but somewhat lackluster content. The book is really not so much about changing the world, and more about one organization in particular. In addition to focusing on an organization, I find that the stories of the people *in* the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they've found who have made or are making a difference in the world. It's not necessarily bad-there are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you. It just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often."
3,"Info, Info, Info!","For anyone starting off in the social entrepreneurship field this book can serve as a good starting guideline. Here the author, Bornstein, presents various stories of individuals whose passions have led them to address varied social causes. The subjects presented are different and my personal favorite was, ""This country has to change"" by Javed Abidi, India: Disability rights. Mr. Abidi describes the social stigma associated with disabled individuals living in India and the work he has undertaken to change this. The numerous stories on various subjects ensure that individuals will see ""their"" cause addressed in one form or another."
5,good read,"This book was required for a macro social work class, but I have truly enjoyed reading it for its own sake! It is well done, with lots of interesting stories and great ideas for how macro change can be accomplished."
4,Excellent resource,"This is a book ""whose time has come""! (read book to understand why this is ironic) Our world is so desperate for change in so many ways. This book gives both the inspiration and the tools for those of us already working to make change become better leaders and advocates for our cause. This is a must-read for all social change advocates. I highly recommend this book and applaud all that Bill Drayton and the Ashoka Foundation are doing to sustain the many people on our planet who are driven to make it a better place."
2,Not the usual Grisham,"I loved The Painted House and A Time To Kill but those were fiction. About halfway through The Innocent Man, I started speed-reading and finished in about 20 minutes. Maybe real people are boring?"
3,Not the usual,"I have read most of John Grisham's books and this is so far the ONLY book which I didn't finish reading within 48 hours. I find it dragging and boring. I know it's non-fiction but it doesn't have to be written like this. It's a bit of a disappointment because I've been waiting for this new book. I am a loyal fan of John Grisham, I buy and collect his books. When I get hold of a Grisham book, I normally read his book within 48 hours and for days I think about it in my head. Well he is forgiven."
3,A sad story with no happy ending. And it's TRUE.,"While not a huge Grisham fan, I appreciate his work and have enjoyed some of his other work, most notably ""The Firm."" Therefore, I was happy to pick this one up, and looked forward to another well written legal tale. Somewhere along the way I actually missed that it was non-fiction, so for the better part of the book I just followed along and waited for the story to get going. It never really did, and overall it was a fairly depressing read. As a fiction work it would have been totally a wasted effort. But when I found out it was TRUE, the shocking brutality of a justice system gone wrong left me feeling ill, and that's a tribute to Grisham's talent. I didn't personally enjoy the book, but it opened my eyes and I'm glad I read it."
4,Some Justice was served,I sailed through the beginning and end but middle of the book was a bit slow. I was disappointed that Grishman let readers know the fate of Fritz and Williamson near the beginning so the story was a bit anticlimactic. However it is still a fascinating well written story. I have not been able to develop a definitive opinion on the death penalty until now. It opened my eyes to some of the injustices of the legal system. Like everyone else I knew it was flawed but The Innocent Man made those flaws really sink in.
1,Not a 5-legged dog!,"It's amazing how many people still today can be duped and will believe Grisham because he's Grisham, a novelist, not an investigative reporter. If you call a 'dog's tail a leg, it doesn't make it a 5-legged dog; and, if you call it non-fiction, it doesn't make it non-fiction'. It may be non-fiction couched in many lies to help support a certain agenda, eg., anti-death penalty or to sell books...or an historical novel. One thing is certain: this is a one-sided novel. Do yourself a favor and take a look at the DA, Bill Peterson's, website for another, more credible view!"
1,Stick to Fiction,"After the number of novels Grisham has written, many people (like me) will buy this book based purely on the author. Grisham has traded on his name to promote a non-fiction long drawn out encyclopedia type series of facts about a truly sorry tale.If you are buying this based on Grisham's past work expecting a fast paced intriguing story...DONT...it's not even close."
1,His worst book by far,"I have read all of Grisham's books, and am a big fan. This by far is his worst book. Although you could tell he spent a lot of time researching for this book, it is SO BORING. The detail he goes into is excruciating. You can easily read 10 pages and 1) feel like you read 50 and 2) realized you could have easily just skipped those pages. Stick with his other stuff because it's really good, but don't waste your time on this one."
2,Not Good for a Marathon,"I listened to this book while running a marathon in Prague. It was funny because according to my time splits, I could tell when I was trying to listen to this book on CD. My times were slower! I don't know if I was trying to concentrate on the book or what, but I just couldn't get myself involved and lost in the storyline. I am yet to finish the book completely. I hope the energy picks up!"
1,E. Beaudry,"This is by far the worst Grisham! I am so disappointed, that I am not sure what to say. It was a total waste of money. I purchase all books on full length audio, which is a lot more expensive then hardcover. I am in the future going to read the reviews before purchasing anything he writes."
2,Never assume!,"I'm a rabid Grisham fan, which is the only excuse I have for the fact that I grabbed this book off the shelf without even reading the cover notes. Surely that counts as a compliment, doesn't it?Having said that, this book did nothing for me. I got about a third of the way through it, then skipped ahead to the last two chapters. I've convinced I missed nothing important. I can find no fault with Mr. Grisham's handling of the subject matter, although it does seem a bit long-winded, and as always, his writing is impeccable (which is why I gave the book 2 stars). I'm just not a fan of non-fiction, even if it written by my favorite author.I take full responsibility for my lack of attention; it won't happen again!"
1,dull,The most excruciatingly dull grisham book and the first I just can't finish. I tried over and over to get engaged in the story and the amount of boring detail just killed my interest. Don't buy this book and if you get it for free don't read it. Too many more interesting options.
2,This is NOT Grisham's best work!,I've read most of Grisham's work and am having trouble finishing this one. Maybe because it's supposed to be true. I'm a Grisham fan but I may give up on this one because the photo section tells you how it ends.
1,Not a legitimate non-fiction book,"While the topic of this book is worthy of being exposed to the public, Grisham's writing is clearly biased to put the investigation and prosecution of the Innocent Man in the worst possible light. His writing is full of his, or other's opinions, and he does not just stick to the facts. It is obvious that he has attempted to sensationalize the event, rather than just honestly report the events and the facts of the case. There is no bibliography to record his sources and the reader has to just take his word for it regarding where he got his information. This is not how this subject should have been reported, nor is it the approach that should be taken when writing non-fiction. My impression of the book is that Grisham is trying harder to make a political statement regarding law enforcement than trying to write an actual, legitmate, non-fiction book."
2,SNORE!!!,"This book was so unbelievably boring that I had to struggle to get through it. It just went on and on, blah, blah, blah! The main character in the book was so unlikeable that I didn't even really care whether or not he was wrongfully accused. The only one I felt sorry for was his sister who seemed to suffer the most. Don't buy this book. It's really lousy. If you want a good true crime book try ""Small Sacrifices"" by Ann Rule, which is superb."
5,Page turning account of an injustice,"Excellent, but sobering account of an innocent person spending a long time in prison, something that is probably not all that unusual and is a good argument against the death penalty."
3,The Innocent Man,It was ok. Not one of my favorite book written by John Grisham. Dont know if I would recommend it to anyone.
3,The innocent man by John Grisham,I suppose its OK. I accidentally downloaded it to my kindle. I had the paperback originally and never got through it. I don't know why this book failed to hold my interest. Maybe its because there is no real mystery. You know from the beginning the subject is innocent and you don't care because he's not very likable. Not what I would expect from John Grisham.
3,"Condemn the subject, not the author",I think Grisham did the best he could with the sad characters that he had to work with. He could have come down a lot harder on the lies told by the D.A. and the arresting law that interrogated the suspects. I din't find his fact filled work any more tedious than Ann Rule that writes true crime stories also. How can you dress up the depressing facts?
4,Good Book...Bad Publisher Decision,"Overall this was a very good read. It really opened my eyes to the injustice many men and women go through. It isn't a page turner like many of Grisham's novels, but I enjoyed reading it. Although, I was very confused on why the publisher chose to put pictures in the very middle of the book giving away the ending!! If you choose to read this book and don't already know the story, skip the photos until you finish the read."
5,The Innocent Man - Should it become Required Reading?,"This book is fantastic. It reads easily like a fiction novel, but you are always aware that these events are true. That knowledge makes the suspense and twists and turns that much more thrilling.I highly recommend this book for those on both sides of the Death Penalty and believe it should become required reading in law schools. How can our legal system go so wrong with a defendant who was so ill? How could a man who was arguably at the pinnacle of every boys dream-come-true in America's Pastime - baseball- drop so far?At the very least, this is definitely a good legal thriller."
4,New territory for Grisham,"Already a Grisham reader, I was intrigued by the fact that this one is not fictional. Even Grisham could not have come up with the bizarre set of circumstances that landed this unfortunate man in jail for so long for a murder he did not commit."
4,Really grows on you....,"I am probably one of the few that did not know this was a non fiction book when I first got it. It starts slow, but picks up and I couldn't wait to finish it.....The story is essentially sad, how could this happen in todays world....? It makes you think. Kudos to Grisham for taking on this project and hopefully making thousands of people aware of the injustice going on around our country....."
4,A true story that is stranger than fiction.,"John Grisham changed courses with his writing and wrote this true account with as much style and fascination as any of his books. Grisham's page-turning style grips the reader from beginning to end and leaves the reader ""drained"" from having pulled so hard for his leading character. Worth the read."
5,Gripping story,"This book is a gripping, slow-burn, experience. If you want fast cars and glamorous characters, stick to Grisham fiction. This is a well structured book and the author leads you through the complex and intertwining stories with skill. Those unmoved by the experiences of these victims must have a heart of stone. The overwhelming sense of ""that could happen to me"" permeates the book."
2,Boring,"While I kmow this was a true story, this book was boring and just a bunch of facts. I just read a case file and wasted time...."
2,Who Done It?,"I found this book boring and repetitive, unlike Grisham's fictional works. Near the very beginning I concluded that DebbieCarter's killer was Glen Gore. Of course, my method of prosecution might not hold up in a formal courtroom procedure. If anyone other than John Grisham had submitted this manuscript for publication, it would have been rejected."
5,Truly Grisham's most significant book,"An amazing investigation into criminal justice as business and its effect on individuals as targeted ""products."" I pray that this story is not typical -- I pray that it simply doesn't happen again."
4,Not really an aberration,"As time passes and DNA and other testing gets better, the number of innocents will rise. One day we may know how many of the executed were innocent. Prisons, like the ones described in this book, are enough to drive people mad. Isn't that punishment enough?"
2,The innocent man,"This book made me so angry, I couldn't finish it. I also found it to be a bit dull. Maybe I'm just not a true crime reader."
2,2 stars for the story not the writer,"I am disappointed that John Grisham did not do justice with the plot because the story in and of itself is amazing. It was dull, boring and I ended up putting the book down halfway through (which I hate doing).I wouldn't recommend this book. Period."
3,slow moving,"I was excited to read Grisham's first non-fiction book, but found the work slow and tedious. I also think the book gave away too much too soon, adding to the drudgery. Still, good research went into the story which highligted yet another example of how our justice system can leap to conclusions that ruin the lives of innocent people, while allowing guilty parties to remain free to commit more heinous crimes."
3,Capotesque,"Grisham has such talent, though I think he did his readers a big disservice. As I read the first few chapters, I felt like he was hurried in the presentation of all the players, as a result, I had a bit of trouble following the relationships I had to reread passages.I think Grisham copied the style of Capote from ""In Cold Blood"" another book I didn't enjoy.I love Grisham, I think he is very talented. He certainly didn't need to take tips from another author's style.I hope that his next book flows with more cadence. His editor should have been more involved in revisions."
3,Not Grisham's best,"I am, absolutely, a big Grisham fan, but this is not his best work. It had to be done as nonfiction though, because no one would have believed the awful railroading of innocent men in a novel."
3,John Grisham The Innocent Man,"I have read almost all of John Grisham book and could put them down. The Innocent Man was ok, some parts where boring"
1,Atypical for grisham,"Although in the past I have found John Grisham's work to be highly entertaining, this effort is an anomaly. The subject matter is somewhat interesting, but the writing itself is so boring as to be almost a rote description of the sequence of events. I truly had to struggle to get through the book, and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Grisham fan,I mostly love John Grisham's books but there is only one word Ican say about The Innocent Man BORING
1,Too Slow!,"I normally love John Grisham's books, but this one was too slow for me. I didn't finish it and then made the mistake of rebuying it again at the airport thinking I had never read it because it had made no impact on me."
1,Boring,"John Grisham has written masterful novels in the past, but this surely is not one of them. I looked forward to reading this, being it was a Grisham story, but was sorely disappointed. Don't believe all the hype on the cover, it's an utterly boring read. Half-way through, I skipped to the end. This will definitely be one for the used bookstore pile...."
1,Fit For A Magazine Article,"I was very dissappointed with this book. It was only out of my enjoying previous books by Grisham that I even read as far as I did. About 175 pages into it, reading every word as I do, I could not do it any longer; it was just too boring. I just read a few paragraphs through the last half and looked at the pictures, which was the best part of the book. Yes this story is very sad, but you could have put it in a magazine article. There was too much writing on Ron Williamson's depression, caused by him not making the ""Big Leagues"" and his use of drugs and alcohol to fight that depression.I was really mislead by the reviews and hype on this one. When I'm into a good book I pick it up every chance I get and keep reading; with this story I found myself turning on the TV and I even found the news more interesting."
1,"Paid for a hardcover, got a paperback...","I bought a new hardcover John Grisham book from this company, a week later I get a used paperback copy. Are you kidding me? I didnt know that determining whether a book was a paperback or hardcover was so confusing. I reccomend that you go to the next company to purchase whatever book, these people are obviously idiots."
4,Great Change of Pace,"This book was a great change of pace from Grisham's regular fictional courtroom thrillers. Because it was a true stroy, it was shocking. I guess my only frustration was the lack of dialog amongst the characters, but it was understandable considering the author was not present for any of the action. I suppose had there been any, it would have been an artistic liberty, and tainted the book. Overall, it was a worthwhile purchase."
3,Drawn out story...,"I must admit that I did enjoy reading this book, but mostly only because I wanted to get to the end. More than half the book is about the background of the two defendents which to me was twice as long as it could have been. The trial didn't even start until after the midway point of the book. Grisham himself stated that he was captivated by Ron Williamson's story because if his background in law. Eventhough my opinion was that the story was longer than it could or should have been, I would still recommend this to anyone who is a fan of stories about murders, the legal system, and/or injustice."
5,Great CD,I normally like to read my books and not listen to them read by someone else. This was my first audio book and I enjoyed it very much; so much that I am purchacing more audio books.
4,Not Typical Grisham,"First, I strongly encourage readers to not look at the pictures with their telling captions prior to reading the book or while reading the book. The pictures are in the middle of the book, and the captions gave away much of what was going to happen further in the book.Sad, depressing and maddening story that Grisham does a great job relating to the readers. It's definitely NOT your typical John Grisham book, but he does the story justice with his attention to details and obvious in-dept research.Worth reading...for sure."
4,Scary that it's a true story!,"Shows the ineptness of police; very good read though. First non-fiction of Grisham's I've read - enjoyed it. The bumbling and wrong turns are, I think, the norm rather than the exception of law enforcement - Duh!"
2,Too Tedious,"Grisham goes into such detail and development of each character the book becomes too tedious. Add to that, the dark and depressing plot, it was hard to keep plowing through the book. Whereas I have enjoyed Grisham's other books, this one was hard to keep reading. I only hope that the corrupt legal system that is core to the book is not wide spread.JAK"
5,What justice system?,"If you have any faith in our justice system, you won't after reading this book. It is sad to think that tragedies such as this happen to so many innocent people because of corrupt law enforcement. By the end of this book you will be so enraged that you will want to drive straight to Ada, OK and confront those who were the cause of this great injustice.......who by the way still have their jobs!!!Grisham is a fantastic fiction writer but an even better non-fiction writer. Can't wait for the next one!"
1,Dateline: The Eternal Edition,"The story is truely compelling and the book needed to be written, but would have been better if it followed the format of ""Skipping Christmas,"" a small, quick read.Instead, we have an edition of Dateline that just never ends. If you purchase this book, go into it with the understanding that every couple of pages is like hitting a commercial break. First, you read what you already know. Then, you get a quick promo of what is to come. The problem is the end never seems to come. I can almost imaging Stone Phillips shaking his head around saying, ""More on that, when we come back.""Sorry, Mr. Grisham, but this is your worst book. And, please realize that such a review comes from someone who owns all first edition hardcovers of previous books and I've taken into consideration ""A Painted House,"" a book I was unable to finish due to severe bordom."
2,The Innocent Man,"Grisham had better stick to writing fiction. The story is there, most definitely, however the writing has turned me off. I'm getting through the book but it's a slooooooooow process."
1,Boring,"This book was painfully boring. I felt like he documented every event of Ron Williams life, whether or not the events were important to the story or even interesting. The book could have been cut down by about two thirds."
3,What happened to John Grisham?,"Please bring back the real John Grisham. What is this? I feel like I just read a summary of a ""60 Minutes"" script. Okay, there is injustice in America. Imagine that! Is this the same guy who wrote ""The Partner""? I didn't see any redeeming value in the telling of this story. There isn't much relating to be done with any of the characters in this book. The book is written well, I guess, but the story is just not worth it. At the end, Grisham says he had so much research and testimony that he could have written much more. Thank goodness, someone with sense edited it out. The book was plenty long."
1,Below Par,"Just seeing the name Grisham led me to pre-order this book from Amazon so I'd have it in my home as soon as possible. When it arrived, I felt like a kid at Christmas, but was soon disappointed. I actually got halfway through the book before calling it quits and going right to the end. Although the story was well written, it dragged on and on, eventually losing my interest altogether. Boring would be a good word to use at this point. I was actually relieved to put it on the bookshelf and select something else to read.Maybe pre-ordering isn't the best option to use."
4,great book,"this is an excellent book, is a shame to think that only the poor are on death row, any1 can get away with a crime as long he /she has money, the justice system only apply depending how big is ur wallet"
2,Boring,"I admit, I was expecting a novelization complete with dialogue (fabricated), incidents (fictionalized), characters (real), and a plot (also real). This dry police report that goes on and on -- well, I just was unable to read it. I already had heard the facts and would just as soon be spared the depressing details.I'm sure this is a factual and comprehensive study of the case. If I'd known what to expect I would have approached it with a different attitude -- or more likely I would not have bought it."
2,Simply Not Impressed,"John Grisham's jump into nonfiction is boring and truly lacks the build-up generated in all of his other works. In all of his earlier work (The Partner, The Pelican Brief, even non-legal works such as The Bleachers, and A Painted House) there have been strong enough background details to keep me amused and in suspense to the point where I couldn't put the book down. However his recent work has been disappointing and has discouraged me from reading his books. Grisham's forte is in his legal thrillers. Leave the biographies to other writers"
3,Disappointing,"Read Rob Warden and David Protess' books ""A Promise of Justice"" and ""Gone in the Night"" instead. These books will make you quit your job, sell all your worldly goods and work night and day to abolish the death penalty."
3,Stick to fiction,"It is likely that John Grisham believed this case was so full of mistakes no one could make it up. But he cannot keep himself from commenting on the lousy work done by the police and the DA's office. There's no mystery to the plot because the author has already revealed what he thinks about the characters. Descriptions of the ""innocent man's"" behavior have to keep recycling because he never really changed that much.Frankly, I would rather read Grisham's fiction, which is taut and memorable."
4,True mystery....,"I didn't realize it was a true story and at first was disappointed. However, John Grisham seldom disappoints me and I read the entire book very quickly."
2,laborious read,"In the Author's Note, Grisham writes that he could have written 5,000 pages. John, 306 were 250 too much.I enjoy Grisham's novels, but ""The Innocent Man"" was a laborious read. The repetition was amazing. Yes, we get it. The ""protagonist,"" Ron Williamson was an alcoholic, and drug addict, mentally unstable, etc. If Grisham wrote this once, he wrote it 50 times. The book would have had much greater impact had the story been told succinctly.This is the second ""true crime"" non-fiction book I read in 12 months (Douglas Preston's ""The Monster of Florence"" the other) and both centered on bumbling investigations into several murders. Both weren't so good.What happened to Williamson and Dennis Fritz, the other ""innocent man,"" was appalling no doubt. The hell they went through to prove their innocence was excrutiating. But as Grisham repeated the fact over and over, I just got to the point where I didn't care."
2,The Innocent Man,"I am quite disappointed by this book. To be honest i find it boring and did not finish the book. I read about 2/3 and moved to the conclusion. This is not a novel, more like a court document written in a more animated style. I have been a fan of the author for years. This did not deliver to my expectation."
3,"Simply ""OK""","This book is straight-forward non-fiction. If you can stay focused, it will pay off for the few. The book is a new venue for Mr. Grisham, and I applaud his attempt. The details can be off-putting and drag on (and on, and on). The characters are unsympathetic, and hard to ""feel sympathy for"". However, if you like a ""based on a true story"" you should enjoy this. I though it was ok, but not noteworthy overall."
5,GREAT READ,Grisham does it again- a GREAT READ. I would recommend this title to any Law and Order junkie.
4,Scary Non-Fiction,"I picked up ""The Innocent Man"" not realizing that it is non-fiction. This is a poignant and important story that I appreciate his telling.I do have a general comment that applies to Grisham's most recent works. Does anyone remember James Michener's ""Hawaii"" and how wonderful and fresh that novel was at the early part of his career? I believe that Grisham has moved into the ""I don't really have to try any more"" in the same way that I feel Michener did.Grisham's move to non-fiction could be important and I want to say -""Please give the real your best efforts now as you did the imaginary when you began your career as a novelist."""
3,Victim of Small-Town Injustice,"I have been an avid reader of Grisham's fiction for years and eagerly look forward to each of his new contributions to the legal genre.This true story did not engage me as much as Grisham's fictional tales. Exhaustively researched and told in exacting detail, the book is a revealing and somewhat horrifying tale of the ineptitude of the police department and legal system that sent an innocent man to prison and basically destroyed his life. However, I never could really develop much sympathy for the victim with all of his flaws and addiction issues.I did enjoy the legal detail relating to the trials, appeals, etc. which display Grisham's joint talent for comprehending and explaining legal processes.The book is bound with 8 pages of photos inserted into the center which should be labelled as ""plot spoilers"" so that you can skip the photos until you have finished reading the book. A glance through the photos reveals the outcome of the story."
5,John Grisham's The Innocent Man,"Great story! I'm glad Grisham wrote a true story, giving details that are interesting and a lot to learn. A great read/listen!"
1,"It's more like a long artical for a magazin, then a Book","This is not a real book. It is a long detailed story about something that happened. Very boring. It is not a typical Grishem book. It is more like a long exhausting magazin artical. You will find an everage of 15 names in each page. In some, I was counting 28. Now think about it, a page full of names. It get realy confusing some times.I hardly made it to page 200, and from then on, just flip quickly through the pages, to get the general Idea of what will happen.Sham... Sham.. Sham. Glad to see that 17 other people gave only a single point to the book.I have the feeling that the book was Co-Writen, by others for Grishem. Co-Writers, that made the veriuos investigation, and their reports, were added to the book, almost as is."
1,I Couldn't Finish It,"I tried to listen to this book on CD. Unfortunately, it was an abridged version. I usually love John Grisham, but I couldn't even finish this. It was like listening to a boring history book with endless dates and events. I wanted to get involved in the plight of the defendants, but just gave up after 2 of the 5 discs. I didn't even know that it was a true story until I looked at the reviews on this page. Perhaps this book would appeal to some lawyer types who love legal proceedings and courtroom details, but not to this 60 year old grandmother."
1,Ignorance and Innocence,"This was a disappointing read because I have come to admire and enjoy the suspenseful work of John Grisham. However, there is no suspense or thrills as mentioned in the interview above. It was written with no creativity or passion for the injustice in the small town. The news accounts by journalists were written with more life than this story.True stories CAN be told with much more passion. Check out: EXIT TO FREEDOM by Calvin C. Johnson, Jr.; IN COLD BLOOD by Truman Capote; LEFT TO TELL by Immaculee Ilibagiza; A MIGHTY HEART by Marianne Pearl and other true stories... whether about crime or not."
1,Grisham should stick with fiction.,"I have read all of Grisham's books. Some better than others, but all were enjoyable. The Innocent Man is one of the very few books that I could not finish. Not only is it boringly repetitive, but halfway through the book there are several pictures of the subjects. The pictures reveal the outcome of an upcoming trial. That's when I quit, though I had struggled to get that far. Sorry, but I could not possibly recommend this book. Grisham has failed with this one. I doubt I will bother to buy another of his books."
1,Disappointed in this one...,"Well, first off a warning. If you are buying this thinking that it looks like another John Grisham novel, it isn't.This is a non-fiction account of rape and murder in which the wrong people were convicted. It is relatively interesting, but long, drawn-out and NOT a fiction novel.I was open-minded when I realized that I had gotten a non-fiction book instead of a fictional novel - thinking that Grisham might have written the non-fiction in his usual style. But it really isn't. I found it dry and difficult to stay interested in after a while and eventually gave up on it.In short, be aware of what you are getting. You may love this if you want to read a non-fiction book of an account of rape and murder in a small town several decades ago, but you will be disappointed if you are expecting another Firm or Rainmaker."
1,BORING,"The Innocent Man was one of the worst books I've ever read by John Grisham. I was open minded when The Painted house was written even though it wasn't a legal thriller. In Grisham's book The Innocent Man you know from the beginning based on the title, the tone of the story and even the book jacket left little doubt as to how the story was going to end. Grisham did not do a good job of connecting the reader with the characters of in the story. I personally will not jump to purchase the next novel.I'm hoping Grisham will use his imagination next. The best part of the book is knowing I'm done. This book will find it's way to my circular file.Sincerely,Karen Lee"

3,I don't like to read fiction today,"I must tell you two trues.At first this is a good fiction book.At second, I must tell you that I loved to read fiction, until I became an adult.Today I am 37 years old and I don't like to read fiction, even when there's a good fiction book , such as this.If you want to read a good fiction, this book can be, a good choice.Page 254:""It was a good way to get hurt, and Dennis vowed that he would never forget to be afraid."""
1,In a word---terrible,"As an avid John Grisham fan I have been waiting for another release. For the first time since discovering him, I had to force myself to read this redundant and grating book. It's obvious from the beginning how the story will end but to add insult to injury the narration is tacky and monotonous.I am deeply disappointed."
1,"What a waste of time, waste of a man, waste of a book","I would call myself a life-long reader or Grisham, and I thoroughly HATED this book. I did not have any sympathy for the main character considering his alcohol and drug abuse, arrogance, inability to deal with rejection from the Major Leagues, rape charges, and other police activity connected to this awful human being. Unfortunately, John Grisham has let his love of baseball, and those connected to it, block his view of how much this man does not need to be remembered. There must me hundreds of other ""innocent men"" who deserve 368 pages written about them. Simply being the highest baseball draft pick from Oklahoma is not a reason to write about someone. This guy and this book were not worth it."
2,"Dark, slow, and disappointing for Grisham work.","Most of Grisham's novels create strong protagonists and feature rich dialogue. This recent installment, however, does neither. Dialogue is practically nonexistent. The main character is a substance-abusing minor league dropout, whose long mental deterioration while imprisoned (for a murder he didn't commit) is the central story.I wonder if Grisham based this on a true story, which might explain why most of the book is a timeline of events with an overpopulated cast of largely unadmirable characters."
1,GARBAGE,This book reads like a police report. Grisham must be rolling over in his grave. It would be very interesting to see who is making money from this trash.
3,So-so,"One of Grisham's few non-fiction pieces. It is the well written story about a local baseball hero who hangs with the wrong crowd, is mentally challenged and ends up on death row for a murder he didn't commit. Years later, he was exonerated when DNA evidence was first used to prove innocence or guilt. Unfortunately, Grisham uses his writings to propagate his opinions regarding ending the use of the death penalty."
3,Really bad example of injustice,"Interesting, because I think it is the only non-fiction Grisham has written. In his usual ""can't put it down style"", but because of the continuous unjust decisions made by authorities and the poor mental health of the subject it becomes a little difficult to follow. It is scary in that it deals with police action that is not only unjust, but downright self-serving and completely untruthful. A young man who could have become a useful and producing citizen is lost completely because of his inability to deal with reality and small town people who were more interested in conviction for a horrible killing than finding the real killer."
5,The Innocent Man,"No matter what style John Grisham chooses for his books, they are all great.This has all the things you want in a story. There is love, betrayal, mystery and legal wheelings and dealings.I read this book in 2 days. It just keeps flowing one page to the next and you realized you are lost in the story and are reluctant to wait til the next day to see 'what happened next'I have passed this book along to two others to read and they also loved it. Some 'true crime' type books are the most enthralling.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a story of a true crime, injustice and the good guys v the bad guys. As participants and onlookers we should all pay attention to the criminal justice system.Enjoy"
4,The Innocent Man,"While a huge John Grisham fan, I was a bit disappointed in Grisham's personal slant to this story. While the wrongly convicted Williamson and Fritz evoke a great empathy and disgust with the judicial process in this instance, and while this is nothing short of a travesty of justice, Grisham's personal views on the death penalty came forth in what was at times editorializing, his comments sarcastic and somewhat sneering of prosecutors, law enforcement, and the judicial process as a whole, and although well-deserved in this instance, I felt he was giving an opinion more than relating the facts alone, not something I expected in a nonfiction piece. I would have preferred a presentation of the admittedly horrendous facts and come to my own conclusions on the judicial system, the death penalty, and the wrongfully convicted."
5,Great book!,I find all Grisham's books hard to put down. He is an amazing author. I hope he continues entertaining the world.
2,Not What I Expected,"I'm about a quarter of the way through this book and I'm forcing myself to keep reading in hopes that it will get better.Starts off very slow, reads like a boring documentary. Not the John Grisham I expected"
2,Tedious Reading,It was tedious to read with the author going over the same ground from endless viewpoints. Grisham seemed to be just filling up pages with repetitions instead of having a great plot.
2,Not enough action for me.,I like some of John Grisham's books and I guess I expect each book to be as good as the one I just read. The Innocent Man moved much too slowly for my likes.
2,Too long,"It seemed to have a lot of ""filler"" and I was glad to finish it. Where is the good old Grisham gone?"
3,A mediocre book about a fascinating case,"I'll admit it: I had never read a John Grisham book before. Thrillers are not my cup of tea, although I read The Da Vinci Code, and thought it was entertaining. Still, when I heard about this fascinating case -a man who gets sentenced to die for a crime he didn't commit, as the evidence clearly proves--I thought that an author who's made a fortune writing thrillers would deliver a fascinating, fast-paced book. Boy, was I wrong.The first part of the book is slow, slow, sloooow. I had to force myself to keep reading. The pace picks up eventually, and the case indeed is fascinating. In the hands of a good author, this could have been an extraordinary book, but Grisham only delivers a mediocre one. I didn't expect John Grisham to be Tolstoy, but neither did I expect that his writing would be so dry and boring."
5,The Innocent Man,"Great story but was expecting something different from John Grisham so a disapointment in that sense. Sounded like an Ann Rule book. I know authors like to stretch themselves and try different things, but when I pick up a book from an author, I go for the known style. I have many Grisham books but I won't be keeping this one."
2,Wish I had not bought it,"I was very disappointed in this story, about 100 pages too long, the details were repetitive and I had to struggle to keep reading. Had it not been a John Grisham, I would have given up about a third of the way through it but I kept thinking it must get better.Next time I will check his book out at the library first. I gave this one away a few minutes after completing it. Big sigh of relief that I was done with it!"
4,Not His Best,"I'm not going to write a plot summary since others on Amazon have already did that. I enjoyed this book but expected more from Mr. Grisham. It was an interesting case that he could have did so much more. I got tired of his constant writing about Ron's mental illness but not going into it. If you are going to mention it that many times then you would think you would explore it deeper. I wish he would have used more court transcripts and transcripts of his interviews with the different subjects of this story. I really did enjoy it but felt that Grisham could have explored it more concisely in parts but dug deeper in other areas. However it is a good book, just not a great one."
2,"This is no ""Helter Skelter""","The story Grisham chooses to tell is certainly one tale which needs to be told, but it ain't no Helter Skelter! A Vince Bugliosi could make so much more of it than our legal thriller writer, who should stick to popular fiction for the masses.The writing style is simplistic, choppy and sometimes grammatically incorrect. Although fast-paced and cohesive, the bias evident by Grisham destroys the pathos of the Innocent Man and stirs a yearning in the reader to hear the ""other side"" of the story, from the cops' perspective."
2,Ugh!,"Having read all (or at least most) of Mr. Grishams previous books I was anticipating a good read. Instead I was treated to a confusing mix of characters and locations thrown at me in a more or less random fashion. You, the reader, must work hard to keep track of who is who and how they relate to which murder at which time or place. Too much work! I stopped at the halfway mark because it was giving me headache.Of course the publisher fails to mention it's non-fiction anywhere on the cover and even though it does say it inside the sleeve (at the top) most readers, like me, just read the description which of course fails to mention this fact. They are, of course, banking on previous novels to sell this one and don't mind a little trickery to do it. The bookstore put it in the fiction section, natch.Save your money and buy something else, anything else actually because this book is the pits in my opinion."
1,Unhappy!,"I've enjoyed reading almost all of John Grisham's books. However, the switch to non-fiction was not a good one. The book was very dry and I had little desire to continue reading, other than my hope that it would get better. The story itself was very serious and deserves to be told. But if you're looking for a good John Grisham story, skip this one."
3,Not his best,This was not John Grisham at his best. A very good thriller but still a bit under par from what we expect from the master of suspense. 3.5 stars
2,The Innocent Man,Did not like this Grisham book. He rambles on and on about each character without developing much of a story!
2,Not the Best of Grisham,"Typically when I read a Grisham novel, it is tough to put the book down--unfortunately this is not the case with The Innocent Man. It is like reading a history textbook for me, and I had a real tough time finishing this work. It was boring."
2,Very Dissapointing,This book reads like a 300 page newspaper article. It is a real - very tragic story about a wrong accusation which ruins a life but this book drags on forever and I actually had to flip over ca. 40 pages because I couldnt take more dry facts anymore that only lead to something that you already know because : there are photos in there which tell you the whole thing before you even start reading. It is shocking how in such recent past or even still the justice system here lacks of professionality and things like this happen - but this book is too dry to enjoy.
3,20/20 special report by John Grisham!,"First I would like to state this novel is nothing like any of his previous novels. Nothing like the Last Juror, which I loved, nor is it like the Painted House nor Skipping Christmas.I really liked ALL of his previous novels that I've read. This one is good too, but, it's a documentary journal. Maybe if you are a detective, you may enjoy this book more than I. In a way, the story is interesting. It makes me feel like as if I am reading ABC News' 20/20: How myriads of fumbling nonsensical yet so very true episode of one town's mistake in trying to put stressed out justice in front of rhyme and reason.I would recommend this book to anyone who is 18 or older who've graduated from high school - to expect what can happen and to learn to deal with zealous law officers - to be an educated citizen to halt any repeats of such embarrassing practice of authority."
4,Highly Recomended,"Another great book by Grisham. Even though he's writing non fiction this time around he still manages to write in the same style Grisham fans enjoy. I've always enjoyed the way he describes a setting: small town feel, laid back people, slow moving days.One small complaint, the book includes photos very early on. If you don't know any details of the main character and hearing this story for the firs time without knowing how it ends, avoid looking at those pics. They kinda tell the story at a high level. I went into the story not knowing a thing about the guy or how it ends for him. After reading the captions below the pics about 1/4 through the book I did know how it goes"
2,Not as engaging as the fictional work,"I have read many other pieces by Grisham and enjoyed all. Admittedly, the prior works were fiction. The works were spell binding, informative,enlightening. This particular work did not measure up to what I have come to see and welcome from Grisham. It conveyed important history and succeeded in having troubling history and messages about our judicial system and the travesty for these innocent men resonate loudly.However, this book was lengthy, plodding and predictable. It might very well have been a more compelling and impactful piece (and message) if it had been half the length."
4,The Innocent Man,"This is a very good book, however, it is not the usual type of book that you would expect from John Grisham. It is a true story of an innocent man being sent to prison (on death row) for a crime he did not commit. The book had a great amount of investigation to make sure the facts were correct and it was very interesting although some times it was a little hard to keep up with who was who. I really liked the part at the end of the book where pictures were posted so you could see the faces of the people you had been reading about. It might have been helpful to have these pictures throughout the book when the characters appeared. But all in all, I would have to say that I really enjoyed reading this book."
4,tbax,"great. Kept me reading until all hours. Being raised in the a small town in the south, it really was a true repersentation of what goes on."
2,The innocent Man,"I have read most of his novels, enjoyed all. The InnocentMan,was a tough read due to the recapping throughout.No author can please everyone. I hav ordered his next book."
3,Interesting story. Not much of a novel.,I am 2/3 through the book. I normally really like John Grisham books but this one has been dull. The fact that it is a true story is the only interesting part and what keeps me going on it. There are way too many names to remember. It can get confusing at times. Grisham does a great job describing each person but it seems so rushed to describe the person that it is difficult to get attached to their emotions. It would seem appropriate to read The Dreams of Ada before reading this book. It makes a lot of reference to it.
1,I couldn't even read past the first few chapters - ugh!,"I bought Ann Rule's new book and this one by Grisham, thinking that I'd be set for holiday reading. I was terribly disappointed with this book and could barely make it past a few chapters before throwing it in the garbage. What a waste of money!I believe that true crime stories can only be written by a select few - and one of those authors is Ann Rule. Any book by her is worth reading.Janet in Florida"
1,One Of The Worst....,"This has got to be one of the worst non-fiction books I've ever read. I haven't read Grisham's fiction books, but I think he should stick to what he knows how to do best.This book was really confusing...jumping from character to character. It read like a fact sheet, and didn't really present anything new as far as the accused being innocent but being found guilty anyway. The Freedom Project shows that, which ultimately freed this man.Sorry, Grisham..."
2,Disappointed,John should stick to what he knows. I have enjoyed his fiction and eagerly awaited his next. But this work was not his usual best.
2,Not good . . .,"At best this is a very poorly organized documentary. Early into the book I wondered if this was truly a work of John Grisham or merely a collection of facts, loosely thrown together in afterthought-like chronological order, baring his endorsement."
2,Justice is hard to find - This book was hard to read,"Honestly, I am very disappointed in this Grisham book. I am an avid reader of John Grisham - have read all his books, and I am having a hard time finishing it. If it wasn't John Grisham, I would have closed it for good at this point. I am halfway through it - and had to get online to see what I am missing.I will keep reading it - I applaud Mr. Grisham for taking on this disgrace of our justice system, but this book is not your typical page turner as his previous books."
1,the end,"Another anti death penalty book by Grisham.How many is that now? Either Grisham starts writing those great books he wrote years ago,or he goes into politics. I am fed up W/Grisham throwing his OBVIOUS left leaning politics in his books.After reading ALL his books I now consider this one to be THE END. Grisham I can get my political news from TV, or newspapers I dont want them in bestsellers.THE END."
2,Stick to fiction,"Boring. You know who did the crime in the first few pages. While I initially was interested in the massive coverup and found the characters compelling, after a while I started not caring. The level of incompetence was distressing; but Grisham's writing was not as good as in fiction. I usually cannot put Grisham down, his writing flows so well. I was easily able to put this one away. Scimmed through to the end."
1,Painful to read!,"I initially saw this story in Vanity Fair several months ago and enjoyed the article. When a friend loaned me the book I gladly excepted it thinking that the book would surely be as good as the Vanity Fair article -- wrong! I made myself finish the book just I could say that I had read it. It was excruciatingly painful. If you are a fast reader, like things in order and quickly told -- don't waste your time!"
2,A very good book ruined,"I was reading this book and enjoying it. In the middle of the book, there are a few pages of photographs of different stages of the suspect/defendant's life. The captions next to the photos give away the story. How stupid was that. The captions ruined this book for me. Why finish it, I already know the outcome. Very disappointing."
3,"Better editing would have helped, but important book","I know Grisham is famous for entertaining novels and I love true-crime stories (many of which are not entertaining) so I looked forward to this book. I was disappointed by the style (I think crisper editing would have kept all the elements of the story pulled together more neatly), but I was not disappointed by the story. And I'm glad Grisham wrote this because he has so many loyal readers, ensuring that the terrifying reality of how easily any one of us can become a victim of the state will dawn on a greater number of people."
4,Grisham delivers with nonfiction,"As you probably know, The Innocent Man tells the story of Ron Williamson, and how he was arrested and charged with a murder he did not commit. He was later sent to death row for the murder, due to a failed system. The story is truly tragic and unfair, but it is this unfairness that draws the reader in. Amazingly, Williamson is not the only person charged in the rural Oklahoma county with a crime that he didn't commit, and Grisham's book brings to light how several bad players including police and appointed defense attourneys can fail people, especially the poor. Unfair trials do exist, and people are wrongly convicted, although I have to say Grisham's book opened my eyes to just how this can occur. I found this book tragic, yet extremely interesting. He does an excellent job of writing nonfiction and letting the reader get to know the background and personalities of those involved with Williamson's case. I could not put the book down and read it in just two days!"
3,Not my favorite,"I have read all books written by Grisham and thoroughly enjoyed most of them. I ordered this one simply because of the author. I was expecting a novel, and was disappointed because this book more closely resembles a history textbook."
4,a frightening portrait of the justice system,"As a Grisham fan I own every book he wrote. The Innocent Man was slower to grab and hold me, but after a few chapters it became a page turner. It even affected my previous views of the death penalty. This book brought home to me how spine chilling a trip through the court systems can be. John Grisham did a fantastic job, again."
3,"Grisham's ""The Innocent Man""","I think John Grisham did an excellent job with a very difficult subject. I prefer his non-fiction books, perhaps because I don't want to admit that there are such injustices in our court system. It's a rather unforgettable book to read."
2,Too long and drawn out,"I really like John Grisham's other books, and I expected ths nonfiction book to be different but was disappointed. It appears that Grisham is trying to do a book similar to In Cold Blood, but the topic here is just not as interesting. It is quite long and actually boring until the last fifth or so of the book, but it takes perseverence to get to that point. I think a shorter format would have helped."
3,Disappointing,"I typically am a big Grisham fan, but not this time. For me, this book has been a slow and plodding read. If you are looking for drama and excitement, this book won't deliver. Yes, it tells an important story. If that's the type of novel you want to lose yourself in, have at it. However, stories of sloppy and/or corrupt law enforcement hardly make for ""can't put it down"" reading. If this is the direction Grisham is taking with his future novels, I'll pass and look elsewhere for my dose of great legal drama."
2,Not My Favorite,"I am a big fan of John Grisham books and I have purchased and read them all. This was not my favorite by far.I found the story to drone on and on and take forever to make its point. The main character is not a very interesting man and I found that I didn't really care about him (which is quite sad since this is a true story). Grisham did not make me feel sorry for this ""innocent man"". I hope the author's next book is fiction!"
3,THE INNOCENT MAN,"AS A FAN OF GRISHAM'S FICTION I APPROACHED THIS NON FICTION WITH SOME HESITANCY. EVEN THE STAUNCHEST SUPPORTER OF THE POLICE WILL BE OUTRAGED AT THIS TRUE BOTCHED INVESTIGATION AND SUBSEQUENT PROSECUTION.THIS BOOK DOES NOT HAVE SAME FAST PACE AND EVEN SENSE OF URGENCY OF GRISHAM'S NOVELS SO IF YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR READING PLEASURE PASS IT. IF YOU HAVE A HIGHTENED SENSE OF SOCIAL AWARENESS AND LIKE TO LOOK BEYOND THE SAMENESS PRESENTED BY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA THEN YOU WILL APPRECIATE THIS DISTURBING ACCOUNT OF A MURDER FOLLOWED BY CARELESS, UNCARING AND INCOMPETENT POLICE WORK AND PROSECUTION."
4,Eye Opening!,"Although a bit redundant when talking about Ron Willaimson's mental condition, I thought the book was extreamly well researched and well written. Actually, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars for Grisham's first work of non fiction. He certainly developed the characters well and I thought the sisters, Annette and Renee had moved in with me. As in other John Grisham books, he shared with us how to know the Lord. And this is a case where the prayers of the sisters and the late mother were answered. He certainly detailed the incompetance and non caring attitude of locals in the State Court System of Oklahoma, specifically in Pontotoc county. Bad language to them! On the other hand the Federal Court System, specifically U. S. Magistrate Jim Payne, his staff and U. S.District Judge Seay are to be commended in their dillegence and saving the life of Ron Williamson. The book should be a must read for folks serving in law enforcement positions and in the court systems across the US."
3,The Innocent man,This book is quite an important piece of work as it is about justice or the lack of it in the American South. But be patient because it takes for ever to gain reading momentum
5,Unbelievable,"The Innocent Man is unbelievable. We know these things happen and innocent people are convicted, but the fact that the police, the prosecutors and the courts, could let it happen at so many stages of these cases, without query, is unbelievable. I had to keep reminding myself that this was fact and not some badly constructed 'C' class piece of fiction. I couldn't put it down."
3,Non Fiction,"When I started reading the book I did not realize it was a non fiction work. As I got into it, I looked more closely at the book itself to learn that it was non fiction. While the book is very well written, I found the story very frustrating and disturbing. My rating is based more on the injustices chronicled in the book than in the writing."
4,The Shortcoming of the Justice System,"John Grisham tells a true story that shows how our justice system can truly fail.The case of Ron Williamson shows us how Ada police and detectives ignored overwhelming evidence and placed Ron William in jail for the murder of Denise Haraway, one which he did not commit.I am disappointed that Grisham will not make any more adventures into non-fiction, because this was a very interesting and eye-opening read."
2,Dissappointed!!!,"I love John and I constantly rave about how interesting his books are. Not this one. I have to say, this is his first book that I thought was just flat out boring. I read half of the book but just couldn't take it anymore and had to move on. I love baseball and the story still didn't grab me. I hope this was just a bump in the road for John. I am going to try his new book ""The Appeal"" and see if he got his swager back. I think he was trying something a little different writing about a true story. I think he should stick to fiction, that is where his skillz are. I can't recommend anyone buying this book. Borrow it from a friend if you just have to read it."
4,great read,I have never read John Grisham's books because I always read non-fiction. This is a great read. I am going to read other books by this author! Anyone should read this book it is very informative and scary to think innocent people are on deathrow.
5,Everyone should read this,"I can't say I loved this book simply because it's a true story and so very heartbreaking... had this been fiction, I would have loved the book. Why 5 stars? I did sail through it and was appalled to say the least. It's a story that needed to be told in all forms available. Yes, it was on all the morning shows and some talk shows, but I did not hear or see anything about this prior to Grisham's account, so kudos to John for getting it all down on paper.Tragic. Enlightening. Heartbreaking. Appalling. Bittersweet.Shame on those who had a part in the years of wrongfully accusing, and eventually convicting real people, with real families who were subjected to such horrid treatment. What an injustice to the victims and their families as well."
1,Did not like the book. Would like to get a refund.,Have stopped reading the book. To much negativiity in the book. would like to return the book and get a refund. Not like the other Grisham books I have read.
3,Very scary truth!,"Dragged a bit but was true to Grisham style. While I like his fiction better, his recounting of what happened, and happens, to innocent people is really mind-boggling. Thank goodness for the Innocence Project and its ilk."
3,Great Story - Tedious Writing,I listed to the unabridged audio version of this book. Between the pedantic writing style and the narrator's monotonous voice it is a wonder anyone could make it through the 12 hours of this audio book. I didn't.The story is compelling if you can get past the two major faults I already mentioned.
1,dry and tedious,"Please don't assume you are getting the regular John Grisham novel. If you like true crime, it MIGHT be ok, but still it rambles on and on and repeats things until you just can't stand it. I read ALOT and this is the first book in a LOOOONG time that I didn't bother to finish. I wadded through almost half and realized it just wasn't getting any better. Choose something else !"
1,Threw it away....,"I was disgusted with the poor writing, awkward telling of the 'story', and just about everything else. I literally threw it in the trash."
1,the innocent man,"The truth, unfortunately, was very boring. Why the author is so surprised to uncover injustice when stories about prisoner releases because of new DNA evidence abound. Overall the repetition of the hearings etc. were tedious and boring. Expect more from Grisham and if i could get a refund of 11.99 cdn I would return it."
1,Simply Terrible,"Grisham has been on a decline for a while. I do hope that this is the bottom. It's just plain boring. My extended family has now gone to buying one copy and sharing it. We all miss the old Grisham. Painted House was ""different"", but ok. Skipping Christmas was awful. This is worse. Very hard to just get through it."
1,A waste of talent...a waste of my money,"I could not wait to pick up the new Grisham book and bought it the day it came out. Unfortunately, this one time, I was completely let down. While I enjoy non-fiction and thought Grisham would do a killer job, I was bored. For once, it took me a week to finish a book, instead of a day when I do nothing but read his new book. If you are looking for a good read, this is not the book. If you are looking for something to put you to sleep, by all means, buy the book.I'm looking forward to the next book and am hoping its back to non-fiction."
2,"Compelling, but not a Grisham best effort.",This documentary is not one of John Grisham's best works. At times the book was hard to follow however he did make his point in the end. I think Grisham's talent is writing fiction and he should stick with that.
1,reads like a newspaper,wow this is one of the worst books i've ever read...comparing it to capotes 'in cold blood' makes this attempt at writing look like childsplay...there is no imagination in this stale tale......save your hard earned cash and sit this one out!!!
1,ABSOLUTE RUBBISH,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM GRISHAM . SECOND RATE JOURNALISM AT ITS BEST .JUNIOR REPORTERS COULD DO BETTER!!!!!WHOEVER RATED THIS AS A BEST SELLER SHOULD BE FIRED!!!!!
1,This Book Is Boring,I'm a Grisham fan. I read everything he writes. Typically I buy his books the day they come out.The Innocent Man is his first non-fiction book.I hope it's his last.This book is major league boring.Can I return a book to Amazon because it's boring?Grisham's book will be great for curing sleeping problems around the world because your eyes will close as you go through boring page after page.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
1,BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY!!!,WHAT AN INCREDIBLY BORING BOOK! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DON'T THINK I'LL BUY ANY MORE GRISHAM BOOKS AGAIN.
2,overrated!,"The first few chapters started out good....and it then went downhill from there. This book was hard to follow, often boring and attempted to make an obvious point that didn't quite ""hit home."" I felt like I was reading a college freshman's position paper on the death penalty. STICK TO FICTION, GRISHAM!"
1,BORING!!! How can I possibly listen to any more,"I am at the end of the 2nd CD, and this book gets more boring by the minute...please someone tell me it gets better!!!The litnay of dates and names is endless, in 1978 this...in 1981 this...in 1988... and on and on....the lack of dialog and colorful descriptions is so disappointing.Mr Grisham, what happened? I have loved your previous books! Where are you hiding your talent?"
2,Ann Rule Revisted,"I am definitely not a Grisham fan. I think his fiction is written in formula form due to his publishing so many books so quickly (much like - shudder - Danielle Steele). I decided to read this book, however, because I found the premise to be interesting and a sad reflection on what can happen in the criminal justice system. I couldn't make my way through the morass of details without becoming frustrated/bored, so I mostly skimmed it. I had no high expectations of Grisham, and he didn't surprise me. Ann Rule writes about true crime in a much more engaging way. I don't understand quite how this book made it to any best seller lists. It is not worth the time I spent reading."
1,A book that sucks with a capital S,I started out hoping for something intriguing. The back blurb led me to believe I was in for a treat and what started out great soon descended into one long boring drone. At times I had to force myself to pick it up again. Can't put my finger on what it was. Perhaps it was Grisham's need to constantly hammer home what a great guy Ron was (he should have trusted the readers to come to their own conclusions). Or perhaps it was all the erroneous boring day to day activities that Grisham constantly subjected me to. A lot of it felt like filler and I began to wonder if this story really fit the novel word count. Somewhere here is an interesting story but the author's style is too heavy handed to pull it off successfully.
2,"I am a JG fan, but.....","I am a big John Grisham fan. When I heard he had a new book out I went to my local library to secure a copy. I am glad I did not invest $30.00+ to buy this book. Although it is thought-provoking, it is not what I want from JG. If I want to read about ""true crime"", I generally turn to the writings of Ann Rule. I will continue to read Grisham's books, but I trust he will get back to the fictional fast-paced style I have come to know and love."
2,Grisham should stick to fiction,"My title sums it up. I just couldn't get into this book. The innocent man is such a reprehensible character that I have not been able to sympathize with his plight. He may be innocent of the murder, but this is one guy who didn't need a book written about him."
5,Compelling. Concise.,"I could not put this book down. Its concise, clear and compelling because it reminds you not to put too much faith in those in power. The criminal justice system in our country is the best the world has to offer, but thanks to Mr. Grisham for reminding us that it can go awry, and usually to those who need it the most."
3,Dissapointment,This is not up to the standard you have come to expect from Grisham.Some of the book seems to repeat itself. Its a real shame a town in theU.S. would be so blind to justice and would convict mentally ill personsbased on such weak evidence.
5,Excellent expose,"I agree with other reviewers that describe this book as both ""compelling,"" and ""depressing,"" but would add ""inspiring"" in the sense that there are some (few) who stepped forward to right this terrible wrong! I am certain that there are others in America today in a similar situations and hang on to a thread of hope. Nevertheless, Grisham tells the story in his previous 'page turner' style and, despite his last few efforts, is back!"
2,disappointing,"Although I am a Grisham fan, I was really disappointed in this novel. It moved incredibly slowly, and read more like a case note than a novel. I didn't care about the characters, and just couldn't get into the book. Sorry, John, this just wasn't one of your best efforts."
4,Gift for Husband,My husband had asked for this book for a holiday or birthday gift. He really seemed to enjoy it. Yay!
1,The Innocent Man,This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. I tried to get through this book but it was very difficult. I finally skipped about 100 pages so I could get to the end. I get that he was trying to show how incompetent the prosecutors and police were but it took to many pages to do it.
3,Fascinating story,A true story of the violation of law by those who are supposed to enforce it. The characters are repulsive and it's a little too long so that as a reader I lost interest. Still it's well enough written that I was moved to Google the main character and validate that it was a true story.
4,Why are you defending this guy?,This is the first time I have ever seen the author write like a reporter. I think he really felt something for the guy who was truly too screwed up to care for himself. More personal than usual.
4,Very disturbing but thoroughly engaging,"I picked this book up at the library and didn't realize it was non-fiction until I started reading it. I have read all of Grisham's novels, and while this book wasn't as smooth a read, I was impressed by the level of detail and the enormous amount of research that went into writing it.What remains with me after reading this book is how close Williamson came to being executed - only five days. How many other innocent men haven't been as fortunate? I also wondered about how the juries were able to decided guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence was underwhelming at best.Injustice can happen to anyone, it seems. Scary."
3,Sad truth.,Amazing that this is true. It was written like a newspaper article. I would have enjoyed it more as a novel.
5,John Grisham's first Non-fiction...,~The Innocent Man~I Really Enjoyed reading Grisham's first Non-fiction Novel. the story Really makes you think just what kind of justice system we have! it's Amazing to think How many INNOCENT people are in prison? and on Death row? and are put to death? that TURNS out to be Innocent!! Sad Very Sad!!!
5,The innocent man,"Purchased for my Kindle, thought I had read every book Grisham had written but missed this one over the past fewyears, was a wonderful book that kept me spell bound for entire time."
5,Grisham should write more non fiction,I read almost every page of this book with a knot in my stomach. Excellently researched and written. I would read a grocery shopping list if it was written by Grisham.
4,"Slow at first, but gains momentum","I had a hard time making it through the first 100 pages of this book. I actually didn't know it was nonfiction (received as a gift and just starting reading -- I didn't read the blurbs). I really didn't like John Grisham's writing style -- it came across as a list of facts.But once I started feeling for the main character, Ron, I had a hard time putting the book down. I began fighting for him inside, and got pretty wrapped up in the story.*Spoiler*In the end, it was a pretty sad story. Even though he was free, the damage had been done. He finished his life as best he could. And of course, he never received true justice (even though he got $$$)."
3,"Great story, dry writing...","This is an important story that needed to be told. Those that weren't entertained...well, life isn't all entertainment. This was highly educational. But Grisham's writing leaves much to be desired. He mentioned The Dreams of Ada often in the book, so I picked it up. If you want to read someone who knows how to write non-fiction, read Robert Mayer. I have not finished the book yet, but it grabbed me immediately. The Innocent Man didn't."
3,I guess it is good,"I have actually only read until half of chapter two right now. The first chapter at least is very good I was totally hoocked in, and then... the second chapter, well it tells you some background info and at least for me is really slow and monotonous, still good nonetheless. I m stuck in it so far, but I'll persevere through it, it looks like it will be good.Also, it is not so much of narrative as I thought it would be but more like... don't know how to say it is a third person narrative that whatever the name is doesnt know what what goes on besides the facts. there you go, they are all facts. but good, I think..."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I have read other John Grisham books and have really enjoyed them. However, this work of non-fiction did not live up to my expectations. It was very enlightening, seeing how an innocent person of little means can be convicted on information not based in reality. The second half of the book held my interest much more than the first half. Most of the book was a detailed account of the the main character's life and subsequently the case. At times it was a little slow. I congratulate Mr. Grisham on a story that needed to be told. Unfortunately, there are many more like this one."
2,Un-inspiring,"I have read all of Grisham's books and was looking forward to this one, however, unlike his past works, I have a hard time wanting to pick this book up and finish it. I've had it months now and just have no interest in how it ends. His past works have been ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" readings, this may be a true story, but it does not keep you spell bound nor interested enough to ""not put it down""."
1,NOT one of his best books...,"Long, Drawn Out, Repetitive, Irritating & BORING...more about statistics of the real crime than his writing...NOT one of his best books...in fact, in my personal opinion, it was a FLOP!"
4,A Fascinating and Horrifying Story,"While this isn't one of John Grisham's best literary attempts, the story is fascinating. I read the book in one sitting. It's a perfect example of how our justice system can go totally wrong, with horrifying results."
2,Stick With Fiction,"Having read each of Grishams novels, and been happy with most of them.....even pleasently surprised by those not set in a courtroom...it was with some trepidation that I picked up his first forray into non-fiction, The Innocent Man. Overall, I was not impressed, and found myself quite dissapointed.Grisham is a wonderful story teller. Perhaps not the most poetic, but his characters and storylines have always entertained me. All of which is absent in this book.I found it to be little more than a regurgitation of the facts, with a rather thick bias. Gone is any hint of wit, or even the slightest sense of his humor.Anyone on the fence regarding the death penalty might benefit from its pages, but aside from that, I'd recomend you wait out his next novel."
2,The Innocent Man,"John Grisham should stick to fiction! I have read all of his books so far but this is the weakest. Even though I am an Okie, and it is in my state it was too much to do about nothing."
2,boring...,"Stick with Grisham's fiction. It wasn't until after halfway through this one when things got interesting. Very well researched, but too much filler to make a good read."
2,Where's the heart and soul?,"I'll be brief. Grisham writes action-packed novels which are fairly interesting and readable, but his foray into true-crime should stop here. The premise for Innocent Man is undoubtedly thought-provoking, a classic example of perverted (in)justice, but Grisham is not the man for the job. I had to stop at 150 pages because I was bored to death--it read like a dragging newspaper article, a recitation of events without the heart and soul that makes the story come alive. Say what you will about Ann Rule or Jack Olsen--they can make the players jump off the page and keep you riveted to the end."
5,INCREDIBLE ACCOUNT OF AN INNOCENT MAN'S JOURNEY,"It doesn't matter, fiction or non-fiction(as this one is), John Grisham is going to keep you interested. This is a well-written account of a horrendous miscarriage of justice! This is an incredible narration of an innocent man's conviction of a terrible crime! You won't be able to put the book down until you have read the last word."
3,Not what I had expected.,"Book arrived in a timely manner and in the condition described. I was dissappointed in the content of the book. It was frankly sad, but boring, and frustrating watching how the justice system can be manipulated to the extent it was in this book. I didn't even finish it."
3,Good Book,"It was a good book. Perhaps not as exciting as some of Mr. Grisham's other books, but worth reading nevertheless. Give it a try."
3,Doesn't Flow quite like some of his Fiction,"Grisham writes a good book, but I think I like his fiction better. Perhaps because this is based on fact and he couldn't create the scene flow to be as consistent as fiction since life doesn't always follow a smooth pattern. I also feel that there was a little too much proselytizing to have the author's view on what occurred. The author seldom intrudes in his fiction even though they're his characters formed from his belief system; the spectrum tends to be broader. He wasn't there to experience what all the players were dealing with and there's certainly a general condemnation of those involved. Right or wrong, 'just doing my job' is certainly an easy escape of responsibility, but at the same time, when you must make a decision based on the only information you have before you, you shouldn't necessarily be vilified. Hindsight is always 20-20; in fiction, that's fine, but in real life, it tends to sound heavy handed from an experienced novelist."
5,Best Grisham book out of 14 I've read,"I've read 14 of JG's books and The Innnocent Man is the best so far - and it's a well researched true story. I read JG books in between serious books bc they are such easy, fun and mindless reads but usually have weak disappointing endings. The Innocent Man Eye is gripping /eye opening and it will make you admire JG for writing this and the Innocence Project / Barry Scheck."
5,An Innocent Man by John Grisham,Amazing research and depiction given by John Grisham. Really makes you wonder how many innocent men and women have been convicted of crimes they didn't commit. Great read!!!
3,Quick Review,"A legal thriller from John Grisham with a twist -- this one is true. In the early 1980s, in the small town of Ada, Oklahoma a young cocktail waitress is brutally raped and murdered in her apartment. Right from the start, the local police force suspected Ron Williamson, a former local baseball hero who became a transient. With barely circumstantial evidence, however, the prosecutor was able to convict Ron and have him sentenced to death.Frightening look at what can happen when a perfect storm of corrupt law enforcement, ineffective defense lawyers and indifferent legal and medical systems combine against an innocent individual. With evidence so clearly lacking, I was left wondering how it was even possible for travesty of not only a guilty verdict, but also a failed appeal, to occur. Part of me wonders if Grisham didn't sugarcoat and gloss over the complete story."
5,GREAT BOOK!,This review is being typed on behalf of my 9 year old daughter! She says very informative and a great book for a Pokemon lover!
4,the great pokemon book,"I have many books that have old cards and not current info. but this book as I all all the all the cards ,I say this is the best pokemon price book ever!"
5,Best Psychic TV,"Unless your a raver, this is the best Psychic TV album to get. As a fan of things stranger and more challenging I would rank this alongside Throbbing Gristle as the best work Genesis-P-Orridge has ever done. The album is a sound scape of ambient noise, rituals, chants and some of the best gentle and mystical pop/folk songs you'll ever hear. Yes, pop/folk from Genesis-P-Orridge, so you know it's going to be weird, haunting and creepy. There are also strange spoken word tracks by Genesis and Monte Cazaza... oh, yeah, and David Tibet of Current 93 plays bones and bells and stuff... There's nothing too esoteric to get about this album, ignore that review. If something puzzles you on here then it's just a mystery to be enjoyed... You don't have to understand everything in life, do you? In fact, wouldn't you say the unknown enriches your life? Sure it does... Now, get this album."
4,Great storage!,I've had metro shelving for years. This was just as easy to assemble as metro. Holds alot of clothes. I only wish it was acouple inches taller to handle longer jackets. I actually purchased a 2nd set because my husband wanted a set for himself. Plus the cover hides everything that we have stored inside.
4,Very sturdy but...,"This type of material is definitely sturdy enough for loads of clothes. I'm really happy it does the job but I don't like the way the two hanging rods are hung too low. All my clothes end up sitting on the shelves on the bottom. Otherwise, it is a great buy and I am sure it will last for years."
4,Perfect solution,"My 19 year old daughter's clothes outgrew her closet and dresser, and were about a foot deep all over her floor. I looked at a lot of free-standing closets, and was worried about this one because it sounded too good to be true for $99. It arrived fast, was easy for one petite person to put together, and is unbelievably solid and well built. It has tons of space, and the shelves are tall enough to hold stacked plastic drawers. Compares favorably with the much more expensive wire shelving from the Container Store.I should give it 5 stars, but the dark grey cover is really ugly, so I'm giving it 4."
3,"great closet, but way way way overpriced","this is a great place to store my closet overflow. it's sturdy, easy to assemble and attractive. however, it is ridiculously overpriced. i saw almost the exact same unit at target three weeks after i ordered this for a THIRD of the price (39.99). lets just say i had a huge case of buyers remorse. take it from me and try to find this piece some place else."
3,construction is good; color is ugly,"The construction is steel, so it is solid. I made one long clothes rack on the left (with a short hat rack on top) instead of the two racks that are too short for any actual clothes. Save yourself some time and aggravation - do not attempt to set this up without a level. There is no other way to keep track of where the plastic shelf holders should be placed.I wasn't looking for anything fancy, and I'm certainly no design maven, but the grey color is hideous for the bedroom. I was hoping for tan or off white or something. I guess I should have read the fine print, but I never imagined that a wardrobe would be such an industrial color. It would be fine for the garage, but very off-putting for the house."
5,The best CD for everyone in your house,I have purchased the original Golden Slumbers CD for myself and 2 other friends who have new babies. We all love it. The music is great and you can listen to it over and over and not get tired of it. My son is 8 months old and he listens to it every night since he was born to get him ready for bed. I have placed an order for Father's Love and I know I will enjoy it just from listening to it online. I would highly recommend both cds to anyone. You will enjoy them!
4,A must have for little boys and little girls,"Absolutely beautiful songs and incredible singers. Worth every penny I spent on it, as my son, husband and I all love to listen to it as we fall asleep at night. Be aware, however, that two songs talk about the death of a father, which some kids might find traumatic to listen to at night."
5,fathers love,"I was given this cd when my son was born. I was told it would help relax him and enable him to sleep better. I swear it did! But, I still listen to this Cd myself 4 years later. I find it so realaxing. I have given many a copy as gifts....."
4,Rare coverage of VSS!,"If you are stuck using Microsoft's code control tool, this book may give you some practical info on branching, pinning, and all that other VSS garbage. I researched a bunch of CM books and this was the only one that detailed VSS branching."
2,Not a bad place to start...,"Overall, not bad information about SCM taken as a whole. Spends a bit too much time on Builds, which vary too much between development tools and such - would have been better off cutting back on that, and leaving it to a different book. The Source Control aspects were lacking. I was really looking for good information on branching strategies, and how best to use things like promotion states, and that information was almost completely non-existent.If you haven't really started doing any work or research with SCM, this book is a decent start. But the reality is, you could probably find the same information in a few hours of reading articles you find via search engine."
5,Great book from a new perspective,I had the opportunity to read this book last week. After hearing all the new of the war - It was refreshing to read it from a soilders perspective. You get to know JB as he writes / emails his letters home from his start in basic training to his involvement in the war.
5,Read it today,"Mr. Hogan's book gives us a perspective on the war quite different than the one the ""unbiased"" press wants us to have. A great read from a new author, sad, funny and poginant. A must read!"
4,The quest for the best,I became interested in this book through the works of Joseph Campbell who often made reference to it. It is a tough read at times because of the style but is worth the effort if you want to find out more about the personal adventure and the possibilities of a living (creating) a genuine life.
5,"Parsival, English tranlation","An ecellent way to meet this kind of literature (I did read it also in the original mediaeval German text), in a more understandeble version!"
5,The Finest Translation,"Helen Mustard and Charles Passage's translation is the finest version of this book. The text reads very well and contains a good many memorable lines that just don't show up in the other versions.If you're ready to study source material on the mysterious subject of the Grail, this is the version you want on your shelf."
1,Tedious,"I am required to read this book as part of completing a college bachelor degree program, and I must say it is one of the driest books I have ever read.The points that Mr. Montgomery makes are tediously constructed, leaving the reader feel more confused about topics. This style of intellectualistic prose is nearly unreadable, and generally bloated.Reference upon reference are stacked to make points, contructing a maze that few scholars could (or would want to) backcheck for accurary.If you do not have to read this book, stay away. There are better, more concise apologetic books on the market. This book did not improve my depth of understanding on any topic the author covered. It added nothing to my knowledge base. And for that reason, 1 star."
2,Wouldn't stay on,"Very comfortable to wear, but the sleeve kept slipping off my pinky toe. I was disappointed, but maybe I just have really skinny pinkies?"
1,"These did not work for me, however I found a solution that did","My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters. These toe sleeves did not work for me. They slipped off the toe, they were not comfortable. After trying it for about a week I threw them out.I found a better solution that works for me. I use BodyGlideBodyglide Advanced Technical Formula - .45 ozto put between my toes. They now glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don't have any blisters.This saved me a lot of pain, I wish I knew of it earlier. I hope this solution will help someone else with a similar problem.Ali Julia review"
2,Visco Gel Little Toe Sleeves,"The little toe sleeves fit very poorly, if at all, and do not provide any protection for the toe. They also come off very easily if you are wearing socks."
5,Great surface,"I have an extra wide ironing board and the cover that came with it was so thin. This cover makes a great surface to iron on, almost make me want to iron!"
2,"Can they learn, do they iron?","Too small, has a seam around the edge that moves and ends up in the middle of your shirt. Is too thin, shirt ends up with a Chicken wire design ironed into it."
2,Ironing Board Cover wrong size,"The ironing board cover did not fit my board. I called the company to have it returned and the woman was professional and helpful on the phone; however, when we took the package to the post office they did not accept it for return. I followed the directions given my the woman on the phone, and the end result was pay additional shipping to have it returned. I guess it will go into a garage sale some day. Always measure first is my advice."
2,inaccurate description of product,"Product indicated certain measurements,however actual product was smaller than indicated measurements.It was not usable and we are still waiting for a refund."
2,Wrong size,Unfortunately this cover is the wrong size. I needed the cover for the professional ironing board.
5,rowenta ironing board,went all over looking for this particular ironing board...i mean all over....went on line....saw in in minutes on amazon....It was at my house in days. great
1,Not what I expected,"It isn't so much the product was bad but it wasn't the correct shape for my ironing board - to return it - well, they make it SO difficult that it isn't worth it - which is what they want you to think. It was more costly and time consuming to deal with the company than it was worth. I would never order from them again."
3,FESTIVAL OF POPULAR SONGS,I have not received this music album yet but looking forward to it I am sure there will be some lovely tunes there to play JOYCE R.
5,TOP SHELF,This used music book came to me in almost mint condition. Although 30 years old it is perfect. As far as the music is concerned these are very playable arrangements for the Adult Intermediate pianist. The collection provides many hours of pleasure and enjoyment.
5,Excellent book!!!,"I bought and received this book about a month ago. I had been using the Gonzalez book for quite some time. It's quite poor compared to this book. This handbook is so accessible and complete, it's all I'm using in my work now. It's very much like a textbook and handbook and how-to book all rolled in one. I work for Microsoft in the digital video area and I'm using it daily. Kudos!!"
3,almost good,"this book is so poorly edited, it's distracting. the ending, I don't know, maybe the deadline snuck up but it almost seems like another writer stuck paragraphs here and there. much more disjointed than the bad editing seen earlier in the book. there is some fun stuff, some sections are compelling; quite readable for an inexpensive, Joan Collins book from the 80's."
1,Will this purchase ever come??????????,Well here we are March the 2nd and I still don't have my product. I was given a partial credit because I originally ordered this product on January 25th and I was told 9 days ago that I my light on Friday but no!!!!! This has been the worse experience I have ever had ordering online. Amazon should really do something about it.
4,run strong,Purchased the book because of Kevin Beck. Funny guy and a great runner. He had a blog for a couple of months and every post made me laugh out loud. The book is good too.
3,"Attractive, but openings are too big for standard toothbrushes.","I had been hesitant to purchase this toothbrush/tumbler holder because the manufacturer-provided image made the satin nickel finish look more like a matte aluminum. I was pleasantly surprised to see the actual finish is a true satin nickel. It doesn't come with a tumbler but I guess that should be easy enough to get. The holder comes with mounting plate, screws, and anchors included- all which remain concealed after mounting.Unfortunately, I will be returning this holder. The problem for me is that the toothbrush openings are too large to hold standard toothbrushes. I use an Oral-B Indicator Toothbrush and it falls right through. The measurement of each opening is 1.5cm width & 2.5cm length. I know there are larger/bulkier toothbrushes out there, none of which I use or like. Too bad, because it's a nice-looking holder...it just doesn't work for me and may not for you either if you use a standard-sized toothbrush."
2,Does not fit Nokia Lumia 900,"While this is a very cute and nice looking case, it does not fit the Nokia Lumia 900 as advertised!!! It took me about 10 minutes to shove the Lumia in there, at which point it was impossible to get out. Do not get for this phone! For another smaller phone (it fits by boyfriend's iPhone quite nicely) this seems like a nice case."
3,Nice Collection of Songs,"This would have to be Toto's second best album after ""Toto IV."" The song writing is pretty good and so is the production. It's quite a bit better than the previous album ""Fahrenheit."" A little heavier. ""Anna"" and ""These Chains"" are the best songs. Good album."
5,Incredible playing and songwriting,"The late, great Jeff Porcaro was the best rock/pop drummer who's ever lived. All the musicians are top-notch here, but it's Jeff who stands out. Check out how TASTY he plays on this entire disc--especially the cuts ""These Chains"", ""Mushanga"", and ""Pamela"". No one else has ever set up such monster grooves, nor will they. Jeff is sorely missed by fans of great drumming."
4,"If I were you, I'd buy this CD","Toto is one of those bands that can really knock you out. Like a lot of people, my collection of their music started with the popular (classic) Toto IV. While it's often tough to follow what was such a great album, I think the Seventh One comes pretty close. Being a musician myself, I'm very impressed with their songwriting, musicianship, use of harmony and the production value of this album. Their playing makes perfect sense. I also believe that Lukather's guitar playing is right up with the best. If you're already familiar with the band or just getting to know them, you'd do well to start with Toto IV and The Seventh One."
2,A very average album,"As a fan of this band's previous music,I was very disappointed at this 7th album for there is nothing on it to equal the band's previous classic ballads.There is nothing to equal classic songs like ""99"" or ""Georgy Porgy"" on this very average album,just some derivative and largely mediocre attemtps at songs. Save your money or buy the old albums instead."
5,"Complex arrangements for a ""pop"" album","Listen to the first track ""Pamela"" and you'll know what I'm talking about. The arrangements on this album are so sophisticated it's a crime it didn't share in the praise Toto IV had. Listen to the drum pattern of Mushanga -- or the phrase trading throughout Pamela. No wonder these guys were (are) in such high demand for session work."
4,Better format - many repeat recipes,"This new book is more professionally done than his previous book, but many of the recipies are duplicates from the original book. If you don't have the old book, buy this one. If you already have the old book, don't bother with this one."
2,What they don't say...,This is good dye (I think.) But its expensive. They don't tell you that only dyes up to 1/2 lb of fabric per packet. Keep that in mind when you order it.
5,Great For Peachbloow Collectors,Very extensive descriptions and pictures. Great information. Wouldve liked to have more price lists. Overall a great book for collectors.
2,"It works, but...","This is a nice little unit that does the job, but has some odd quirks. The text-to-speech engine is generally good but will sometimes hilariously mangle street names. Not just long complicated ones like you'd expect, but relatively mundane names as well. The list of Points of Interest is incomplete - some major chains of restaurants simply don't exist to it, yet tiny hole-in-the-wall establishments are constantly found. The British voice sounds much nicer to my ears than the default American one, but for some reason will not read street names at all. And so on - nothing deal breaking, just odd and mystifying.Yet for all that its pathfinding seems excellent, it's very accurate and I have no major complaints. It's good at the essentials, but once you get past that the extras are almost bafflingly quirky. I would only recommend this unit to those who find an unbeatable deal and are fully aware of its oddities."
2,Train people,I bought this for my nephew since he is so into trains and has a huge train set. Very overpriced item if you ask me.
1,Overrated,Frankie Bones has always been overrated and this album proves it. This album was outdated before its release.
3,Applaudes to author Reichman & Cris Alexander(Photographer),"2/25/02 The book will not support the notion that ""lean is mean'(however hard it tries to) nor that a fat woman should feel complimented when ""the taxi driver"" says he wishes his wife were as 'jolly' as the 'stouter versions' who ride in his cab are...but it will support the proof that Ms Reichman 'looks thinner' than she said she was(many good photographs with hats that suit her well), and that she has authored a book that was pleasant reading with several pages devoted to itemized beauty tips!"
5,Good purchase,"Item came quick and exactly what I expected. I will most likely order again, if I need a similar item."
5,"Seventy years old, but still highly relevant today","Written on the eve of World War II, this is a thoughtful, well-researched account of the forces which transformed the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire into the nation states of the Middle East which now exist. It focuses particularly on the promises which the British made to the Arab peoples and on which the latter had relied in deciding to join the fight against the Turks in World War I, in the expectation that success would lead to their independence--promises that were cynical at the time made and ignored in the peace negotiations. Anyone who still thinks the problems in the Middle East began with the creation of Israel in 1948 would profit by reading this book and getting a longer view of the issues which are still with us today."
2,Paperback version missing maps,"I've ordered the paperback version for $35.95 and this version seems to be missing some important pieces.Namely, the maps. Of the 6 maps, only 2 are present, the other 4 are missing.I contacted Amazon.COM and they sent a replacement paperback. It too was missing the same maps.Must I spend an extra $100 to get the Hardcover edition just for 4 freaking maps?I wonder if Amazon's entire lot they received from the publisher is defective in this manner.Amazon needs to do better quality control and check the books they receive to make sure that they aren't missing vital information.That is why I gave it 2 stars. Had it contained all the items in the hardcover edition (which the previous reviews were based), then it would gave gotten 4.5 or 5 stars."
5,Beethove: Complete String Quintets,Obscure and wonderful Beethoven. What a delight to listen to. Beautiful recording in Surround Sound. The playing is exciting and a real breath of fresh air. You really need to find this recording IF YOU CAN . . . its a keeper.
4,BIRTH OF A NATION blu-ray version,"GREAT RESTORATION on to B/R and good clear transfer. Sound and picture is the best it will get and I'm so pleased that this film has been given the full treatment.Looks great. As for the story and length, well I thought that many scenes could have been made shorter to keep the film moving at a good pace and this could have made the film easier to sit through. A bit like DANCING WITH WOLVES which was first released at 3 hours then 4 but 3 and a half would have been easier watching and still cover the full story.How people could sit through 193 min back then beats me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you like to see a great transfer of this film."
1,Looks Homemade,"""Birth of a Nation"" may be a great film, but this copy is of the poorest quality. Let me clarify that I'm referring to the DVD who's cover image is of a Confederate flag with the silhouette of a soldier on a horse holding a battle flag. I purchased it because of the ""Remastered Edition"" tag, but buyer beware! It's linked to customer reviews of other editions (e.g., KINO), but that's not what you'll receive. If this thing was remastered, it was done on an inexpensive home computer. I should have been wary of opening it, as the DVD cover was printed on an inkjet computer. Trust me, there are many better pressings available."
1,Racist trash!,This is not a cinematic masterpiece. This is racist trash. The fact that this got rave reviews when it came out in 1915 showed the sick psyche prevailing during those times. Griffith's name will always be associated with this celluloid infamy. No amount of artistc whitewashing or reasoning will remove the fact that this is the epitome of racism in films. It makes you sick as a human being watching this perversity.
1,I liked Intolerance better...,"Ugggh! On top of being dated and boring, this movie is so RACIST! Intolerance wasn't so fun either, but I liked it's theme better. D.W. Griffith films are not my favorites anyway, but I watched this out of curiosity and all I could say when it ended was UGGGH! ""Birth"" was stupid, and some of the ideas in it were outlandish. If you want to see a good Griffith film watch Intolerance. D.W. Griffith created the birth of a nightmare."
2,Wasted opportunity,"May 1, 2002This DVD is a wasted opportunity. The transfer is okay,but the uninteresting documentary included included hereis compiled and narrated by an unknown historian with themost droning, lifeless intonation since ""Mr. Ed."" There islittle else in the way of extras.The most seminal and controversial Amwerican film evermade has been snuck out the back door."
4,not for the politically correct,"I bought this movie about ten years ago and found it to be entertaining for a silent movie.It's the story of two families(one Southern and the other Northern)and how the War Between The States affected them. Althought melodramatic and sappy in some spots,I think the over all gest of the movie was pretty accurate. That being that the yankees came,they saw,they conquered.And not being satistfied they sought revenge,using the newly freed slaves to do it. (To the reviewers that denounce this film for it's glorification of the Ku Klux Klan,remember this was not the klan of today.It was about the only vehicle Southern Whites had at the time to end the terroristic activities of the predominantly Negro ""Union Leagues"" and their Carpetbagger leaders.) If you want to see the closest thing to historical accuracy in a fictional story about the War and Reconstruction,watch this movie.If you feel more comfortable with politically correct fantasies I suggest you go watch ""Roots""."
2,"Historically Important, but a lousy movie","Griffith is a historically important director, having invented much of the grammar of cinema, which this film showcases. BOAN was the most popular, profitable, and influential film of its time. As such, it deserves to be seen. But the movie itself is racist propaganda that celebrates the Ku Klux Klan as noble and heroic, castigates blacks as bloodthirsty rapists out to ravage white women, and pleads for white supremacy. The story is over-the-top cornball melodrama, the acting is ludicrously hammy. Suitable for film buffs and cultural historians. Others will find it alternately ridiculous and boring."
1,The DVD doesn't work,I played this DVD when I got it and there was about 20-30 minutes of it that wouldn't play. So I returned it and got another one. It was broken in the exact same place. So I returned it and got a refund. I ordered the same film from another manufacturer also through Amazon.com. It was more expensive but that one worked fine.I am very satisfied with the return policy of Amazon. They make it very to return things (they give you a shipping label to print) and they will exchange or refund returns very promptly.
5,Revisionist History,"This film is a technological marvel, given the state of the art in 1915. While hanging the narrative on historical fact, D. W. Griffith attempts to make the Ku Klux Klan the sympathetic hero figure in the piece. The atrocities committed during the reconstruction period following the war between states are undeniable, but the emergence of the Klan served only to exacerbate the reprehensible acts of the occupation government. Viewed from a historical stance however, Birth Of A Nation is a wonderful time capsule illustrating the viewpoint of at least one unreconstructed rebel film maker. Any student of the so called ""Civil War"" would benefit from this unabashedly southern sympathizing tale as remnants of the mind set expressed by the film maker exist even to this day."
3,One of the most important films,"Unfortunately, this was one of the most important films in history. Every High School should show it as part of Black History month. I am a white man who was raised in the South during the racial strife of the 50's and 60's. The story in this film represents what the white people in the South believed was true. This film was a nightmare to whites that were afraid of the blacks. This movie put back racial equality back to nearly the slave days. It was an awful event when it was released. You should try to understand that people believe it and it had a terrible impact on our country."
3,Political Satire in a Post Civil War Nation,"This Classic movie was the result of the post American Civil War. A reverse political satire of the racist theme of Plessy vs Ferguson the ""One Drop"" rule. A must have for history buffs of American History, or those studing Civil Rights."
2,This is Blu-ray??,"Ok-I know this is a really old movie and a classic as such, but I was expecting, on a Blu-ray disc, a much cleaner movie, and by that I mean there was so much dirt and scratches on the didc it looked like no one many any attempt to clean it up. I have seen many regular DVD's where a much better attempt was made on cleaning the disc up.If they weren't planning on doing a better job, why put in on Blu-ray in the first place?? A real disappointment"
2,"2 Stars for the Film's Techical Gifts, 0 for the Story","Don't rent, buy, or even watch this film just because it's on the AFI's top 100 list. This film is racist, racist, racist! Hearing it was a classic, I watched it, and, no lie, I really tried to like it. But the Klan glorfication on this film is something I cannot overlook. The fact that the majority of the black people is this film are actually white, and dyed, doesn't at all help this. No wonder this film is still used as a recruitment piece for the KKK! But another thing in this film that cannot be overlooked, is the vast majority of technical achievements. I think it is the only thing that keeps this film from my utter reviewing wrath. Buy it for the technical contributions, but, hopefully, for nothing else."
1,"For study, not entertainment.","It is true that this film was a great leap foward in the technical development of motion pictures. However, D. W. Griffith was too smart a man to NOT know what the story was about (based on ""The Clansman"", hello). Critics who like the film either already decided that it was a cinema classic before they saw it or are in some way racist themselves. The film is not subtle in how it poorly portrays blacks, and the birth of the Ku Klux Klan is not an unfortunate footnote to the story, it's the Finale! It can't even be said to be a reflection of the time in which it was made because it met with protests when it was released (this at a time when blacks were still second class citizens!). Griffith was a wizard with a camera and the film may be looked at for that, but only that."
2,not as great as i was expecting,"I've heard a lot about Griffith's movie as being an important one in film history. So I watched it. First of all, this movie is extremely racist. Even taking in the time that Griffith lived and the setting of the Civil War, the racism still was over the top. And the movie was dull, though it did get slightly better as it went on. So what you have here is three hours of a boring movie that is extremely racist. I'm just not sure what to make of it."
1,Biased Perspective,"What can one say about this perplexing film? Technically significant and even a landmark achievement on one hand; hopelessly biased and unredeeming on the other. After weighing the pros and cons, I settled on the cons. The film will and can never change its unconstructive perspective, which to my mind cancels out its technical achievements. One of the most unfortunate films to be placed on any best-films list."
2,This is the SHORT version,"This film was one of the assigned viewings for a History of Film class. The professor specified the 180 minute version and specifically described the ending as being important to a complete analysis of the work. My bad for not checking the specifics for this edition, but be forewarned: if you want the full version, this is NOT it. This version ends with Liberation. Several other key scenes appear to have been edited out."
1,Remastered?,"I'm not sure what ""remastered""means in this case but this DVD is of very poor quality. After ordering the DVD the movie was broadcast on TV and the quality was vastly superior. Perhaps quality controls are needed to assess how products are described."
4,The All-Time Classic is back in Blu-Ray,"This very powerful, and controversial film, looks gorgoeous on the Blu-Ray format.This impressive three-disc set is the best version of this film to date.One can hardly believe that this film is over 95 years old.Looking better than ever, this classic film comes along with some great special features to satisfy the film historians.Fans of classic cinema should not miss out on this one.Be aware that this one is usually hard to get.This porduct is viewable here:The Birth of a Nation - Special Edition [Blu-ray].- G.M.I."
3,significant insights into a mindset,"i wondered how many people had actually seen this movie all the way through? it's a compelling telling of a tale.... a black and white version of history (triple entendre) and is at least honest in it's candidness of a perception of american history that underpins the (political) philosophy of many, yet today. we can caricature the clan, but it's theme still lives on, and if we dig a little we will find the pervasiveness of it's extent 'back in the day', as late as the 1920's and their march in washington d.c. i would liken this acceptance/popularity/lack of critique to ford's, charles lindberg's and others alignment with nazism.watch it for it's historical place in movie making, for its lifting up the curtain of those times and also for its relevance to today."
2,Birth of a Nation (1915),"This film truly demonstrates Griffith's genius as a director, producer and editor. He manages to tell an epic of a story with bold camera work, clever cuts and balanced pacing. He includes historical interpretation, adventure and romance. It's unfortunate that he possessed such a twisted morality. The first half, which concerns the civil war, is very watchable, but second part portrays blacks as either ignorant or evil (mostly played by whites in blackface) and features the Klu Klux Klan as righteous heroes."
4,The Birth of a Nation,"D. W. Griffith's silent film based on The Clansman by Thomas Dixon. Graphics tell the story. Two families, the Stonemans from the north and the Camerons from South Carolina, have their friendship destroyed by the Civil War. Lillian Gish is Elsie Stoneman. Scenes proceed from Civil War battles to the Lincoln assassination to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. There were 625,000 casualties in the Civil War, and this is essentially an anti-war film. Modern critics like Roger Ebert miss the point. Griffith's title refers to the birth of the United States, heretofore a loose confederation of former colonies, not to the birth of the KKK. A graphic near the end reads, ""Dare we dream of a golden day when the brutal War shall rule no more."""
4,Powerful use of film as propaganda,"I saw this film as a little boy and still have nightmares! Any one who majors in rhetoric should see this film because in that sense it is powerful. However, I don't think children should watch it for the exact same reason. If you appreciate the film for its storytellig merits, the scene of the Ku Klux Klan coming in to save the day is both breathtaking and enough to scare the living daylights out of you. See also ""Triumph of the Will."""
3,Cinematically Good,"People thought I was crazy when I bought this DVD mainly because of the cover artwork. I had to explain to them that this is a Ku Klux Klan propaganda film, but that also it's one of the first epic films ever made.I watched Birth of a Nation in a film class I took in college, and even though I was appalled and disturbed by the content, I had to look at the film from the perspective that, cinematically, it's a good film, especially since it's a silent film. You just have to look beyond the content, as hard as that may seem, to see the real beauty of it: the filmmaking."
1,The Birth of a Nation DVD review,The dvd was defective and froze after a few minutes. We tried starting it several times and it froze at the same spot.
3,"It really drives home how brutal war really is, expecially this one.","The brutal action is horrific, and I suspect that it is an accurate pro trail of what really happened. There is not a lot of explanations of what is going on. The battles were famous battles and I am sure that a history buff, who would know the situations involved, would really enjoy this film. For the most part I was historically lost as to what was going on in the big picture. I am sure that a scholar of the Civil War would be fascinated by it. If you do not already know that war is HELL, you will after you watch this film."
1,Boring Film.,"This film, lauded as a classic, is absolutely boring. It's worth seeing only for the advances in film making that have been made since 1915. I found it very difficult to sympathize with any of the characters in the movie. A 3 hour waste of time. Don't see this movie for a good storyline. See it only for a reminder of how far the entertainment industry has come since 1915."
3,People Need to Use Their Heads,"Listen folks, just because you watch a film about the forming of the KKK does not make you a racist. In fact, those who are willing to watch the film instead of bashing the film are the smart ones. You can never learn if you never see the mistakes of the past. People need to consider that in this day and age we don't have the time to be mud slinging each other about watching a film! That is what it is, a film; pure and simple. By watching you can gain a more accepting aspect on people and their behaviors, not everyone is a peace loving person. Some make poor decisions and end up going towards hate, to prevent this you need to learn to better yourself as a person. This goes for films on the Nazis as well."
1,America will rot because of its unwillingness to evolve,"YOU PEOPLE THAT LOVE THIS CRAP OF A MOVIE ARE THE SAME AH THAT WILL B & MOAN ABOUT RAP MUSIC AND CLAIM IT SHOULD BE BANNED ........ONLY IN AMERICA ARE PEOPLE SO STUPID ......... One if the worst movie to ever exist. More time should of been spent thinking about what was being made here for all of eternity, the director later discribed this movie as his biggest mistake, Which he tried to make ammends with in his next film . there's more important movies out there that should be remastered not this.This movie will always be a symbol of intolerance in America, and the reason this country will die a slow death.YOUR ONLY AS STRONG AS YOUR WEAKEST PART""S (the 1 percent of the countrys wealth prove that).......THE SAYIN GOES WHEN YOU CANT WIN AN ARGUMENT CORRECT THEIR GRAMMER INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
3,Disturbingly powerful,"I can't ignore the technical and artistic advances that were made in this film, but it is also the most difficult movie I've ever sat through. I was so very angry and repulsed by Griffith's vision for two reasons: 1) his vision itself was repulsive, and 2) Griffith had packaged it too skillfully for it to be overlooked."
2,"Historically important, but . . .","I am always amused whenever critics attempt to praise this film. They have to add a proviso that they cannot approve of Griffith's disgusting attitude toward blacks (whom he would have called ""negroes"" or worse), and his outrageous portrayal of the KKK as the saviors and preservers of the good and the pure. The film was supposed to have been titled ""The Clansman,"" after the ludicrous book that inspired Griffith to make The Birth of a Nation. I wonder how many of this film's praises have been sung by African-Americans? I happen to be one of the whitest men in America, and yet I believe this film should be universally reviled - not banned but despised."
4,Film Mking History,D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation is an epic telling of the Civil War. In terms of a vision of the scope that film could take Griffith was a notable master. On the other hand he was a racist who protrays his views throughout this movie. As a historical piece this movie is great but extremely dated.
1,Not worth it,"Don't waste your money even if it is a ""classic"", the quality is not the best. Get it from a friend or library."
5,Sensational,This is a great album. Full of all his greatest hits past and present. You get to hear the wide variety and vast talent of Farnham. A must have in any CD collection. Congratulations on a great career John Farnham!
3,John is THE voice,"I love John Farnham. No other singer has ever touched me as he has. His music is guaranteed to make me happy. I adore his voice and love everything he sings. However, there have been a couple of not so good songs (""I've been so lonely"" was a really strange and painful song, thank god he didn't release it as a single), but there are none on this collection.Only the well known songs are on here, plus the bonus of ""We Will Rock You"". I will always be a Johnny fan and will go to every concert (but I don't like Tom Jones so I'm staying away from the Tom & John one), but all fans probably have all these songs already. I didn't buy this album, but purchased the one bonus song online. However, the DVD of this collection is a MUST have for all John fans. I give the CD 3/5, but the DVD 5/5."
3,So So,"Frankly, I had bought this item for the sake of one song ONLY ""You're the voice"" which I absolutely love. I had hoped the other songs would be almost as good - at least 20% of them. However I was disappointed probably because I am not very familiar with John's music in general. I could have opted with less expensive single disc collections containing ""You're the voice""."
1,CD,"It was not what I thought. I wanted Running Away by Midnight Hour.I have never heard of this person. The details on this advertising ismisleading and it did not give enough information on this item.It took forever to receive, I am throwing it away."
3,amazing songwriter,"If you happened to pick up his solo ep ""blister and burned"" i would probably skip this. those are the best songs. the others feel like filler.kinda sad to say, since i loved twothirtyeight...but everything chris has done after has been lacking the magic his old band had."
4,Fast&Speedy,Very pleased with the amount of time it took to process payment and ship order.Received my book sooner than expected and I enjoyed reading it!!Thanks for the Awesome Customer Service.
2,It's not all that it seems,"The style of writing is not committed, it doesn't sound factual, one way or the other. There are many blacks who, because of their features and white skin passed for white and became successful. People have handed down stories for centuries about family members who left to cross over as white; some of it is actually fact. What Rogers ""writes down"" about the men in this book, isn't with clarity, there isn't definitive supporting documentation that's ""clean""; some of the information can be traced, some cannot be validated. I have no doubt that one or two of these men were actually Black. There still remains not enough information that clearly supports Rogers' collection of information."
3,Is There More?,"Though I enjoyed reading the information published in the book, it left me wanting to learn more. I wish it had more substance, more in depth."
1,Not a book...,This was only a pamphlet and didn't give true discovered information about the five black presidents. This type of information can not be taught in black history classes because it only hints around information that may or may not be factual. Maybe one day real evidence will be revealed.
5,Kindle,"I also got this in the Kindle version. It looks fine on iPad. Only certain pages seem as they were scanned--the pages with the vertical kanji/hiragana; I don't read Japanese, but it appears readable in any case."
4,"Generally good overview, but missing details","We found the book to be a good start for planning our New Orleans trip, and once there, a good reference for addresses, phone numbers, and basic services. It falls short on some of the details, such as not even mentioning Tipitina's or some other well-known places that we found recommended in other sources (yes, I know it isn't totally comprehensive, and maybe it's just a little out of date). The reviews and advice were right on. We used several walking tours we got from out travel agent, as well as a review in an American Airlines magazine as a guide, and between the three of them we had a great vacation. Also, NO is quite spread out, so an index or something by area (French Quarter, Garden District, Metairie, etc.) would have been very helpful."
5,Awsome Stroller,"I Got this Stroller Specifically for a Trip to Disneyland for my Son who just turned 4. I needed a Stroller for him to Fit in he's 43"" Tall and 45 lbs. This stroller is rated to 61 Lbs, and the Seat was decent enough for him, He even took a 2 1/2 hour nap in it with the seat reclined! This Stroller Performed for about 17 Hrs Straight with a Very wiggly 4 yr old Boy. This Stroller is 43"" High and was great for all of us in our party, I'm the Shortest at 5'8""! Got many Envious Looks from Tall parents who were pushing there umbrella Strollers with bent backs and Fingertips!! I'm Positive We'll use this same stroller for Disneyland Next year Too!! and everywhere Else in between. Exellent Stroller for Older Babies :)"
2,Sub-standard,"For the first 4-5 months it worked well, but then the foot strap broke, making it very inconvenient for the child to travel; after prolonged use of the stroller, even the wheels become very stiff."
5,Not your typical regency!,"A beautifully written romance! Shows how women who were abused by their husbands got little support from the law and society during the period. The decriptions of the heroine and how she reacts to, and deals with her abused condition were moving as well. Credit must also be given Dunstan, whom Fairchild has made a wonderfully perceptive and caring character. This is Regency romance at its best!"
3,Don't bother buying this book,"It's a good book but it has been revised and updated under the title ""Storey's Guide to Raising Sheep."" I didn't know this - bought the Storey's Guide, but sheep breeders kept recommending this one. So I bought it too, and then learned that it's simply the previous version of the Storey's Guide. So buy the newer one."
3,A Good Beginner Book,"Raising Sheep The Modern Way is a good book, but since it was written in 1989, show techniques, and market industry requirements are a bit outdated. It is a good book for the beginning shepherd, but not the advanced showman."
1,I expected MUCH more...,"As a traditional klezmer enthusiast still within the ""youth culture demographic,"" I had really hoped I would find the music of Socalled and Solomon more exciting. As a lover of electronic music, I'd hoped to at least hear some ground-breaking sampling and rhythm techniques. Neither was delivered. The term ""hip hop"" seems to have been tacked on for no other reason than to hook a trendy audience, but it's nothing new. The choice and technique in the sampling is rather cliche, and reminds me of music that was actually new around 1991. Not a compliment to, it's quite a desecration of klezmer music, in my opinion. If you respect the genre and want to see it treated well, pick up the Klezmatics (and yes, I realize at least two of its members are featured on this album) or Di Naye Kapelye. ..."
1,stupid ignorant design,"We bought this and the electric cord that comes out is only a few inches long and on top. Can't use without an extension cord which would look really stupid if used indoors in our living room. What a peiece of crap. One of the worse products ever purchased. Throwing it in trash, will never buy a Stinger brand product ever again as long as I live. Totally stupid design."
4,mosquitos beware,"This review is for the 80 watt model, but wanted to post what i found about these.I dont know why all these web sites are sayin ""bug zappers dont kill mosquitos""....my wife kept telling me her parents had one that worked well. I just bought one and in 30-60 minutes I had killed 200 bugs, about 45% asian mosquitos, 45% black(local) mosquitos, and 10% other bugs. After the first hour I'm impressed and don't understand why people say these dont attract them. Next im going to try the octenol and then the lurex to see if it helps, even though it did fine without either. I'm in east texas where we have both types of mosquitos. One word of knowledge, the mosquitos do stop flying when the temperature drops to 60 degrees. GET ONE, IT WORKS!"
2,Crappy product,This is not worth a dollar. Worked for a little over a month & quit. On top of that Amazon would not pay for shipping & they charged me a restocking fee for a defective product. By the time it was all said & done I ended up paying about $28.00 for a product I didn't keep or could use.
3,Pile of Junk,I am an idiot...the first one lasted 15 months and so I figured for the price I would buy the same one again. Brok inside 1.5 months. Big pile of crap!
3,Ok,Mosquitos still biting. I wish it worked better. Kills a bunch of things except mosquitoes. Which is the reason I purchased in the first place.
1,"Lasts longer than the flies, not that much longer","In common with many of the other reviewers it all starts out with a crackle. The perverse counting of how many flies get baked in the first few minutes of operation is kinda fun till you forget it's there.Sadly in under 21 days of use it's dead and no longer energizes the grid looks like this is either fundamentally flawed as a design or QC is lacking.Addendum.The second one that replaced this one burnt out, not only that it melted the top exposing the live wires. This company is not just making poor products but demonstrable dangerous ones."
1,All Stinger Insect Killers-Terrible,"I have bought and returned 1/2 and 1 acre Stinger bug zappers from Costco 4 times now in the past 3 years. Thank God I was buying from Costco as Stinger products are worthless. Light attracts them but zappers don't work. Some worked for a week and others didn't zap at all. I don't know why Costco carries such a terrible product. I kept thinking, maybe these were a bad batch and I will finally get a good product. Not so, do not buy these products."
1,Doesn't zap bugs,"I tried the 1/2 acre and 1 acre versions. The light attracts tons of bugs, but the grids rarely zap one. The bugs fly around in there like crazy. I put a white plastic bucket under each one. After 2 hours there was only a handful of dead bugs in each bucket, even though there were clouds of bugs flying into each unit."
1,Not impressed at all!,"I recently bought the Stinger UV15. It worked well for one month! In that month I followed the recommendations for cleaning it and keeping it clear of dead bugs. Well just shy one month and the grid has completely failed so it attracts the bugs, but doesn't kill them. This product is not worth the money!"
1,Save your money!,"I purchased one and it lasted about 3 months; light still worked but did not kill any bugs attracted to it. Stinger replaced it under warranty-this time it lasted one month-same problem. Stinger replaced it again under warranty and the third one lasted 1 1/2 months, again same problem.Will not go to the trouble to get it replaced again-will buy a Flowtron which I had used 5 or 6 years ago and which lasted for 2-3 years."
1,Electric grid does not last,I bought this product from home depot. Electric grid the first time lasted 4 weeks. I did all the necessary trouble shooting and no solution. I return it to home depot and got a brand new one fresh out the box. This time it only lasted two weeks. You got to be kidding me. I got stung by mosquito the whole summer. Either this product is really really bad or the bugs in my back yard sabotage it. I should of read other people comments on this before I bought it because I am not the only one experiencing this. I am buying different type of zapper with better rating. for get this ultra crappy thing.
1,Piece of trash,"Don't waste your time or your money. These work great, for about 30 days. Then they fail. I just threw away my third one, and am going to replace it with something that has a better customer review rating."
1,Flowtron Wins / Stinger Fails Over And Over,"In my area the only brand of bug zapper that any storefront sold was Stinger. Each and every one of these bug zappers has failed in 1 year or less. Some burn out with the bulb still working but not zapping any longer. The others have failed where the ballast fails and even a new bulb (at $20) obviously won't work. Of course you don't know it's the ballast until you fork out the $20 for a new bulb and find out the zapper is shot. Save yourself the grief and stay away from the Stinger brand all together. Go with the Flowtron and you'll be a much happier person. Flowtron zappers actually work, don't plug up like the Stinger brand, and when the light quits working its almost certainly just the bulb and not the entire zapper that needs replacing."
1,The negative reviews are correct,"I bought this at Lowes before I found the negative reviews here. I should have taken it back before I even opened the box, but I thought it might last long enough to kill off the nest of yellowjackets in the outside wall of my house.The stinger would clog with yellowjackets everyday and I had to clean it out and rehang it early in the morning before they started swarming again. After about 6 days, the plastic around the bottom of the grid was so charred that it because almost impossible to prevent it from arcing constantly. No amount of cleaning did any good. At that point the chintzy transformer in the unit burnt-out. It's now total garbage. Score - Yellowjackets: 1 - Mexican-made Stinger: 0.Round two is coming. I just ordered the AMERICAN MADE Flowtron 40watt unit. It should be here is a few days. The factory website sells a re-certified version for basically the same price as I paid for the Stinger. Will update review at the conclusion of round two."
2,short life,"We have had this bug zapper less than 3 months, and bulb is burned out. Not happy.....those replacement bulbs are not cheap!"
1,junk - zero stars,"Bought 2 of these units at Lowe's. After about 2 weeks the bulb on one died and I bought a new bulb. Worked for about a week and then that bulb died too. This one is just hanging there waiting for me to replace it.The other unit was hung in the garage. Didn't see or hear any bugs killed by it and then after about a month the bulb went out and I never bothered to change it. Then some months later, I looked up to see the unit was missing. The top of the unit was still there, hanging on the chain. It was chained up properly but the whole bottom just fell off.Honestly, the gooey fly strips did/do a better job.One word review - GARBAGE"
1,POS,"Worked one day, bulb needs a good wack to get started, left a pile of live bugs underneath it since the zapper part stop zapping. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good product if you want to attract bugs so the multiply and produce more."
1,Worthless,Don't waste your money. You're better off swatting bugs with a fly swatter -- plus the one I bought didn't even last one year.
2,Product doesnt last very long,"I am on my second unit in a 60 day period, the first unit went up in about 22 days.I sent back the first unit and Amazon sent me another free of charge, now the new unit has quit also, I am returning it to amazon which now will cost me more money because, the Stinger is 35 days old and I will have to pay a penalty for returning it after 30 days. I can say I don't want another Stinger because neither one really worked any how.Doug from ocean city md"
3,Short cord,I have no idea if this worked. The description does not include information about the fact that the cord is about 6 inches long and it must be kepp away from water. It did not work for us being close to a pool....
3,Does what its suppose to,"This is our second one, the first one lasted 4 or 5 years before giving out.It does make a difference on what colored bulb you use though, the bulb that comes with it works much better than an after market one. And yes you do have to use an air gun or other means to clear the grid because it does tend to get clogged after a night of use. Other than that it does what its supposed to."
4,Awesome if you have attactant!,"I have had this for about a year now, it works great for all insects, but it will only zap mosquitoes with the octenol attractant.The zapper is full of mosquitoes everyday. i just go shake all the dead bugs out. Keeping me and my kids sanity!"
2,Barely Adaquate,"I used this device in my back yard and while it did zap insects, the high voltage circuit burnt out. I didn't realize that once the high-voltage is gone the bug zapper is simply a bug-attractor. I give this two stars because I have had worse experiences with these devices (including one that died in less than 4 weeks)."
1,another cheap product... don't buy,"I live out in the country.. and have a lot of bug problems.. I purchased it at walmart and spent an extra $3 to get the one year warranty.... the best investment ever... The first bug zapper died in 3 days... took it back, and exchanged it for a new one... this one lasted 3 weeks before it died... and took it back for a complete refund... including my $3 warranty.... overall it's a good design, and killed a lot of bugs... but it's cheap and will break very soon"
1,Nothing but trouble!,I have bought 3 over a 2 year period. The all failed due to defective starters. They do not self clean like the flowtrons and are always clogging.
1,Piece of JUNK!,"Do NOT buy this item! I have never felt the need to write a bad review on a product... The first one I got-the electric grid stopped working after a couple days. I took it back and exchanged for a second and the bulb burned out after about a month, replaced the bulb (half as must as a whole new unit) and then the electric grid on this one went out soon after. I never left it out in a strom. This product is junk!"
1,Daily Cleaning A Hassle,"I bought the Stinger this past June to replace a 15-year old bug light that finally gave up (that one got hung up in the spring, plugged in, and left alone until it was stored for winter, and never had the bulb replaced). Due to the design of the grids, the Stinger is constantly clogged ... I have had to add taking it down and cleaning it to my daily morning routine. The bulb burned out after 42 nights ... I unplug the unit every morning. Right now I'm debating as to if I buy a replacement bulb, or find a different, more substantial bug light."
1,Buy Flowtron Instead,"I agree with the other reviewer, buy Flowtron instead. My Flowtron 40C lasted 20 years with the same bulb and never had a clogging problem with bugs. For the same price, the Flowtron 40D is a much better buy."
2,More irratating than the bugs,"On my second one now...Not that I liked it much the first time, just that it is the only brand they sell in the local store here. I will say that while it worked, it worked...I mean, it killed some bugs! These, however, are my problems with it: Bulbs burn out fast! Like after four to six months...And the replacement bulbs are almost as much as I paid for the whole unit! The thing gets jammed up with bugs and there is no easy way to clean it. Finally, it doesn't appear to be very weatherproof. The first one died after a storm and the one I have now has just died. I think I am buying a different brand on here...One that works for more than a few months!"
1,if I could give zero stars.........,.....i would. I tried two units and perhaps killed less than ten bugs.My neighbor bought the larger unit and he no longers even bothers to plug it in anymore.Dont even think about buying this product.
1,Grid Bar Wires Keeps Burning Out,"This model is a redesign of the older one that had the wire grid that constantly clogged up. The grid was replaced with vertical bars that enabled the zapped bugs to not clog so they could fall through the unit. Now the really bad news. The new design uses two thin wires insulated with clear plastic that easily burn. If one moth hits the newly designed grid bars where the wires connect them, the unit is shot because the wire will burn through. I'm on my second unit in 30 days. I'm returning the second one today and giving up on this model. If you contact the manufacturer, you can pay to ship it back and they'll send you a replacement in 4 weeks. It's much easier to return it to the store."
2,Great while it worked,"I bought two of these at a Walmart three years ago and one lasted only one season then just crapped out. Got it replaced free cause I lied about how long I had it then the second one crapped out also...was not able to get that one replaced. The first one finally gave out as well. They worked so good when they worked but both went out on me. And it was not the bulb...tried replacing the bulb but finally had to go with a different brand that did not cover as much area though...we have a BIG yard..The old ones last for years, what's up here?"
1,worst ever,"I went through 3 of these things over a three month period. I couldn't get one of them to work more than a few days. In my opinion, this product made a better bug house than a bug zapper. I just got tired of returning the product last year and will look for a different brand this year."
1,Waste of Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My wife & I live in the country w/ many insects. So, I bought 2 Stingers. First the bulbs that attrack insects burned-out. Replacement bulbs turned-out to be very expensive; even at major discount centers (and don't last any longer). Then, after one season, the plastic casing of the electronic ""zapper"" mechanism literally fell apart. Last night, at the beginning of this bug season, the other Stinger died, although I'm not sure why. Now, I have two expensive, partially used bulbs and zero Stingers, if anyone knows anyone interested in their lousy bulbs. Phooey!"
4,bug zapper,"i've had to blow out dead bugs three times already, aint had it for a month and half.i added an outdoor timer to save money, or i would have given 5 stars."
1,Bad Buy,Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this dud. The darn thing only lasted one month before it died.
4,Really Kills'em Dead,"We live out in the woods. Mine works so well I had to take my air compressor and blow the dead bugs out after just 3 days. I even came up with the idea of cutting out a few of the plastic slats to let the bigger bugs in but you really don't have to go that far. Boy does it ever cook'em! I think next time I might opt out for the 80 Watt model. Can't get enough of that ""sizzle"" noise! Guuuuuzzzzzt!"
1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! PRODUCT IS A DUD, WARRANTY ONLY IF YOU PAY!","This product worked well, while it was working. 'While it was working' being the big caveat. The unit broke after only 3 months. To get a warranty replacement, I have to pay to ship it back to TN, which will cost more than it cost to purchase the unit. And that was after spending 30 minutes waiting to speak with someone at customer service (never did get anyone) and then waiting 3 weeks for someone to answer my emails! Of course, it broke, just outside the window to return it to Home Depot, what a sly business plan Kaz has going.I say avoid the KAZ brands at all cost! Or, if it really is your only bug zapping option, be prepared to buy a new one every 3 months and fill up your local landfill with the old ones.I would give 0 stars if I could."
1,Short Lifespan,"It worked for 3 months, now the grid is dead. No voltage between the grids. the grid is clean (have to blow it out regularly- canned air works). The bulb that came with it burned out in about 30 days. Not recommended."
2,"Too Short, Too Narrow","This is a good, but not great, work. For a more thorough investigation of this topic, read ""The Decline and Fall of the British Empire"" by Brendon."
4,Good Buy,"Condition was largely as described, though there was some underlining (though a ruler was used) in the earlier pages. Overall I am happy with the purchase and the shipment was extremely quick!"
2,Not so tuff,"After one hour with my eleven year old dog, her birthday present of her tuff ball was not so tuff. It did last for an hour though and the peanut butter flavor was a huge bonus. I'm glad we got them on sale though! She killed it."
2,"Not so ""tuff"" balls","Well, I gave this ball to my 15 pound pug. Within minutes, it was full of holes. Not a solid ball. Splits in half and comes apart. Would not recommend this for anything more than short play sessions."
2,Not for super chewers,My dog can destroy these balls in 30 seconds or less. Great to play catch with but cant allow him to have it unless he is bringing it right back to me. I recommend you stick with good tennis balls.
5,4 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: Now let me start off by saying I'm a tennis ball aficionado. I can entertain myself for hours playing soccer, trowing the ball for myself, bouncing it off peoples feet so they don't even know they are playing, etc. But tennis balls tend to fray and Dad doesn't like it when I start pulling off the felt. Plus with enough time I can split a tennis ball wide open. So the wonderful folks over at Petsport came through again, and sent me some Tuff Balls! Word around the dog park is they have a 4 inch model too. I need to get my huge paws on one of those!Conclusion: Tuff Balls are industrial strength, extra thick, non-toxic, and colorfast! If your puppy love tennis balls as much as I do, I would highly recommend trying Tuff Balls! I've been chewing on mine for days and except for the dog hair that's stuck on it, it's just like new."
5,The Door of everything,"This little book is a real treasure, its powerful statements speak for themselves! To get into the right frame of mind (spiritually), it is best to read the book over and over again so the message can penetrate the deeper levels of being.The Door of Everything clearly indicates that the life force or God is within everything, and that this force is with us all the time, whether we are aware of it or not, makes no difference.This book should be in every home, for one can find in it inspiration, hope and guidance for almost every situation in life.Ruby Nelson makes the reader aware of the need to change their outdated ways of thinking and doing, if they seriously want to awaken the Christ within. This awakening will only happen when we manage to distanciate ourselves from the noise of every day life and retreat into the stillness of the heart.Hans Liszikam, author of ""The God Code in the Seven"""
5,So Very Enlightening,"This book helped me years ago better come to terms of what was happening to me. I am a Psychic Medium that began seeing things as a young child. This book answered the questions that I had, it fed and awakened me. I read it over ten times and plan on reading it for the rest of my life. It is a fabulous read.Laura Lyn author ofHealing with the Angel Rays: Simply Ask and Believe[...]"
5,A so so Caillou,"I'm not sure if this Caillou has the puppets in between,but for some reason this isn't as interesting as someof the other. If you like Caillou then give it a try."
1,Quality,"The movie itself is very good, but the quality of the record is extremely low, beyond acceptable."
2,Not one of Astaire's best,"As the reviewers of the other versions of this DVD have said, this is not one of Astaire's better movies. Neither the dancing or the music are memorable."
1,"Sloppy book, lots of errors","I was disappointed in this book. I stopped using this book early on in my preparations because I kept finding typos as well as factual mistakes. The content is very brief, which is okay, but it is hard enough studying for the MCAT without worrying whether or not the material I am memorizing is correct or not. I really don't recommend this book."
4,Bongwater's Kramer's Debut Triple Album,"The first Shimmy-Disc with any meaningful musical contribution by Kramer, after the break up of Bongwater. The psychadelic production that has defined the noise new jersey/new york/nit sound, is mixed nicely with some of Kramer's more sincere attempts at the pop song. Kramer's best solo effort."
5,ADHD Book: Living Right Now!,"I only wish this book was available for me when my daughter was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome back when she was 12. By the time ADHD was diagnosed she was 19 and we had gone through many years of disruption and blame. I will recommend this book to family and friends.Carol Goldberg Maeder, Mother"
4,"Beetle Bailey, the professional goldbrick","Beetle Bailey is the most intellectual of lazy people, spending as much time and effort in getting out of work as he would if he simply did the work. The cartoons pit him in a constant battle with Sergeant Snorkle and together with the supporting cast they make up Camp Swampy. The strip is a lampoon of military life, where the food is bad and served by a hairy man with a cigarette always dangling from his lips. Superior officers are sometimes twits more interested in demonstrating their superior rank than in showing that they deserve the opportunity to command.One of the simplest comic strips ever created, Walker has managed to keep the Beetle Bailey strip active and interesting for decades. It was one of my favorites when I was a child and that opinion has never changed."
4,A fine collection of Beetle,"""Take Ten"" is a good collection of older Beetle Bailey cartoons for those who love the strip."
5,just say the word: amazing,"The new album from Josh Kelley is an adventure of music. It feels like colour in your life and has the power to create a fantastic temper. The lyrics are great and it really makes fun to listen to it. However if you liked his last album ""Almost Honest"" you will love his new one as well because the mood it tells is even happier. It's a great new album and I just have to say the word: amazing!"
3,The writing doesn't *seem* bad....,"The writing doesn't *seem* bad....but there's definitely something missing here. There are lots of details and interesting stories, and some self-reflection. But in the end, I just don't get it. The connections, the analysis, the context just isn't enough to make this story captivating to a person who hasn't had this sort of experience. Which would be most of us. Perhaps after 30 years as a yogi, the author no longer hs much connection to the boy who left home and moved to India and became naked. But in order to understand his story, we need to be able to understand who that boy was and how he changed. Though the surface story is here, the true inner depth seems gone, maybe erased through spiritual practice or ganja, or maybe just not clarified through careful enough writing. It's hard to put my finger on what's missing in this book, but something just isn't there."
4,Interesting...,"Rampuri succeeds here in doing what so many spiritual teachers have not been able to accomplish finding the words and images to convey that we all cannot escape the play of the universe in an unfolding story orchestrated by the gods above. As characters in the divine drama, we make mistakes but keep persevering as we try to do good and open our hearts to others.This is a very inspiring work on a subject that deserves more exploration. Rampuri has given us much to think about with his rich reservoir of fresh images. His advice is simple and sound: ""God is living His secret life through you. Take a moment to contemplate, feel, and taste this delicious truth. Take a lifetime to live it and celebrate it."" I saw him speak inBend and was amazed to see a Caucasian man sitting among ash covered sadhus, who revered him with as much respect as each other. The video of initiations gives us a rare peek into their lives that should be shown on PBS, not at a yoga center."
3,Some true parts!,This version of Jacob is okay. I find it difficult to actually find bible story that are exactly like the bible. Although it is Hollywood's version there is still some true parts to the story telling.
4,Good movie,"Jacob- Was a good movie and it went along with the bible as to most of the events that took place, there was some congecture which is somewhat expected as the scripture does not give a lot of the information for filling in the blanks for a movie."
4,Depicts the Events of the Bible,I love bible movies and this depicts the event of Jacob in the bible. There might be some scenes that were added because we are not exactly sure how it unfold in the bible. I recommend this DVD along with other bible collections
4,A Good Story,"This is a true love story and one that I think is very imporant for anyone who's ever had to work hard for love. Jacob is the son of Isaac, but was born just a few seconds too late. He has a twin brother whom he ends up have to betray, along with is father, in order to get the inheritance her mother feels should belong to him.This movie, made for TV, does the story real justice. It tells the love story of Jacob and Leah and shows that true love conquerors all and is willing to work hard. I think that's a lesson missing in many modern relationships. Real love takes work!It's also a story of forgiveness and mercy because Esau, Jacob's brother, eventually forgives him for what he did to him.Modine plays a very good Jacob and I felt he connected with the character. I also felt the supporting cast was very good also. The costumes and setting helped to move this story along without being distracting.Good family film too."
2,Cussing in a Bible Movie,"Loved some of the other titles by the same company but we were extremely disappointed to hear Esau cussing 3 different times in the movie! We easily could have understood his anger without the profanity. Some creative liberties were taken as well, but they didn't harm the Biblical account too harshly. A few scenes weren't how the Bible depicted it but no doctine was damaged by the changes presented. It was basically the language. The wrestling scene was poorly done and Esau's reaction to Jacob's return wasn't presented 100% Biblical but no harm there. The best feature was the representation of the family dinamics between the sons and their parents... especially Jacob's actions at the coersion of his mother, but the language prevents me from sharing it freely with my children or other church members."
4,A faithful and education retelling of the narrative,"The film is a faithful retelling of the story of Jacob (played by Matthew Modine) the Patriarch of Israel, and begins with Jacob's wayward brother Esau (Sean Bean), selling his birthright for a bowl of pottage. And Jacob's trickery of Esau out of his blessing by their father Isaac (Joss Ackland) at the urgings of his wise mother Rebecca (played with panache by Irene Papas)The film really picks up after Jacob has fled to Haran and the tender story of his love for Rachel (heer beauty and intelligence shown magnificently by the pretty Lara Flynn Boyle) and his relationship with his other wife Leah (Juliet Aubrey) who he learns to love too, not blaming her for the deceit of their father Laban (Giancarlo Giannini) the deceiver.Ends with Jacob's apparent reconciliation with ESau,and the crossing of him and his wives and ten children back into the Promised Land.Fairly engaging but not gripping-a faithful and education retelling of the narrative."
3,Not as good as Joseph or Abraham . . ..,"I love Joseph and Abraham was great, but Jacob wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was ok, but Joseph and Abraham had much better storylines. The biblical story was so action-packed and it just seemed like they could have done a better job."
3,Jacob,"If not for being the story of a servant of God, I would have given this film a much lower rating. Although I love Matthew Modine as an actor, I feel that the character Jacob was casted poorly. I am ashamed to say that his was perhaps the best casted character in the film. The sets were poorly constructed and the acting left something to be desired. I felt that this telling of the story of Jacob was hastily done and the key events held none of the profound quality that they should have. Many of the choices the director made in depicting certain scenes were almost so weak that it made me feel that there was nothing significantly special about Jacob. If I hadn't already read and was familiar with the story of Jacob, my watching of this film would have left me uninterested in learning more about the man."
1,X rated Bible story ???,"I agree with the other reviewers regarding Esau using profanity time and time again. Hollywood just can not pass up an opportunity to defile the word of God. Like a few others, my copy went into the trash before any visitors noticed I was in possession of it."
1,Not worth it...,Why did they have to put all of the cussing in a Bible story? There's no way this could be shown to children.
2,I expect erotism and I get porn scenes,"This movie is a hoax.I expect to see a good erotic drama with Laura Gemser,and I get porn scenes..."
1,EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA,"THE DVD HAS A VERY POOR RECORDING,YOU CAN'T HEAR THE AUDIO BECAUSE IT CONTINUE TO BREAK AND THE PICTURE FREEZES . I HAVE A RETURN TAG FOR THE FRIST ONE THAT WASN'T PLAYING .I JUST WANT TO NOTIFIED YOU THAT I AM GOING TO RETURN BOTH DVD. I WILL SUGGEST THAT NEXT ONE WILL BE TESTED AND MAKE SURE IS PLAYING VERY WELL IN VIDEO AND AUDIO. THANK YOU."
5,The Best,"This has to be one of the best exploitation films ever made, completely going beyond all sense of taste and decorum. Joe D'Amato does a brilliant job in showing us some of the most deprived and hard-core sequences in film history.The bit where the girl is masterbating the horse is an absolute classic. You literally can't believe what you're seeing!Definitely a collector's item in every sense and no doubt soon to be withdrawn/banned, get this while you still can - especially with the excellent extras on the disc.You might be disgusted, but you won't be disappointed!"
2,Don't believe the box!,"I purchased this for my 4 year old son after reading on the box that it's compatible with Windows XP. My son picked it out himself and was very excited to get home and play it. He enjoyed the games very much, but my husband became so irritated having to fix the computer every time these games screwed it up that he banned them from the computer. I no longer had the receipt. What a waste of money. I even tried running them as compatible by changing the settings...Windows XP wasn't even LISTED. But they listed it on the box?! Thanks a lot, Disney, for letting me and my son down horribly. I am now very leary when it comes to buying software from them."
2,Okay as games go,"This game is okay as games go. It is a little advanced for my 3yo to play alone. We also had lots of trouble installing it. I finally learned that with these types of programs on XP I have to just run the play.exe file. There is not a lot of variety in the activities, but the pictures are cute, and My 3yo can answer most of the activities and we can play the game together until she learns better mouse skills."
5,THE CAV WAY!,"Sergeant Christophers' book is an intriguing account of the daily life of the Cavalrymen in Vietnam. The author touches a nerve,with a distinctive voice, as he vividly conveys the intensity of combat and how what he and his men were pushed to accomplish on a regular basis,was quite unique. Rons level of observation and intimidation were only to be outdone by his capabilities. A deep affection for him is imminent. A great book that gives the reader an in-your-face peek at the inside."
5,Parables of the Forest,"Almost twenty years ago a fellow pastor gave me a dozen or so copies of Pamela Reeve's excellent little book, ""Parables of the Forest."" In the years following I have carefully rationed my hoard; not handing them out in bulk or at every funeral, but here and there, selectively, when the grief seemed to hit one of God's redeemed children the hardest. The post-reading response has always been profoundly gratifying. God has spoken clearly and powerfully through this book to those who were shaken to their core by death, renewing them to faith and hope.I have only four left. Sunday I will part with another one and pray that our gracious Redeemer will once again do His healing work in a shredded heart."
4,marcasite ring,"A very pretty sparkly ring. I would like it to have been just a tad smaller, but a good value overall."
4,Got a New Hat,"Worked as expected. I followed the directions to the letter, and it worked great! I dyed my hat that had gotten bleach-stained, and it turned out great! I rinsed thoroughly, and have not had any lingering dye issues. After almost a month, the hat still looks great!Piece of advice: don't skimp on rubber/latex gloves. Get longer gloves that go up your forearm."
1,dyed didnt work,It didnt work for my black jacket so i will prefer to buy something different brand. i spend about 24 hours.to get it dry
1,waste of time and money,"i used one packet for one 100% cotton t-shirt and followed the instructions. it died my finger black after 2 minutes exposure (hole in glove) but it barely made 5% difference to a cotton tee after an hour's exposure. my shirt is still grey. proof even more how weak it is, the white labels are still white. and now my tee smells like dye. maybe if i spent $100 on 20 packets for one t-shirt it would have worked how i wanted it to."
3,Dye,"See, this makes me mad. You want me to review this product but I haven't used it yet. Haven't had time. Been too busy composing reviews for Amazon."
1,Useless,"This dye was incapable of turning two white cotton T-shirts black. I mean, seriously? What a terrible product! I followed the directions, using warm water, salt, stirring for 15 minutes and then again for 45 minutes; rinsing in cold; washing the clothes again ... and my white T-shirt is now a pathetic pale gray. Woohoo.Not just a waste of money, but a huge waste of time, and two splotchy gray shirts!Do NOT recommend!!!"
4,Worked great,"I bought this to dye a scarf i had my fav color pink, to match my hat and gloves. The instructions were simple and the color came out beautifully. The only problem is the color came out much lighter than expected. Its a soft baby pink, not a deep pink as described."
1,Dylon Navy Dye,"This dye does not work!! I used 2 packs to put some life back into 4 pairs of little boy's size 4T pants that were navy and just a little faded. They came out greyish blue, like a cadet blue!! Will never use again. I will stick to RIT next time! Used 1 bottle of RIT and pants came out so Navy they look black when wet!"
5,A must read for any student of history.,"An exceptonally well written and researched account of a shameful chapter of the Vietnam war. It is a fast-paced and gripping read, even when covering points of military and international law that are obscure to the layman. Gary Solis does a masterful job, perhaps as only a combat veteran can, of setting forth the moral choices that sometimes face men during war, and the conflicting ethical forces effecting those who had to deal with this horrible tragedy. Ultimately, I came away depressed because so many involved in the Son Thang incident and its aftermath made morally wrong decisions and choices when the correct courses of action appeared clear from the outset."
4,My Second Fossil,"I had a Fossil before this, and I got a good deal on that one too. This one was a better deal, and it's a smooth looking watch, especially for the price."
1,Terrible service,"After a lengthy wait for the item to arrive, the seller then admitted it was out of stock and that I wouldn't be receiving it."
5,Anson Y.'s book review. HK.< CAN I? >,"Abby's having a "" HOORAY IT'S SUMMER PARTY "" for the whole fifth grade, boys ,the cool girls and everthing. But as soon as she hand out the invitations, she started to worry about what people will think. Will they like the food and drinks? And this question is what Abby worried most: Will they think her bedroom was boring?Then Abby decided it was a perfect time to give her room a makeover! Until the last minute, will she finish in time for the party?P.S. Do people actually paint their rooms because they're worry about what people think? I wonder who."
5,EXCELLENT,"Abbey wants to throw a big party for summer! Then Ms. Bunder asks the class to write a report about their rooms and Abbey realizes how boring her room is. So she turns her room into a Palace of Purple and throws a big party, too!"
4,Colors,"For anyone looking to purchase a black and grey car seat, look at the second picture for this item. You'll notice that the manufacturer needs more megapixels for their digi cam."
2,Sucks! do not buy!,"First of all, the crotch buckle is too close to the crotch, not enough room for my large son. It needs to be further towards the front. Right now, my son is 31.5 months old (2.5yrs for those of you who are too lazy to figure it out) and 37"" and 37lbs, and the straps push down on his thighs and the buckle pushes into his crotch. The straps are too small and I can no longer strap him in with the harness. Luckily i can use it as a belt positioning booster soon.It's also a pain in the butt to take apart to clean.The only good thing about it is the cushioning and softness of the material, it is good for napping in on long car trips."
3,Stupid Buckle,"This is an ok carseat...not as good as it looks in the pictures. Be ware if you order from amazon. The company who sells it will not take a return if the box is open- it does not matter if you used it or not...don't open the box if you want to return it. Also, the worst feature, that I did not see explained anywhere is that the buckle is a puzzle buckle...very difficult to buckle a child in who does not cooperate!! I would go with another seat if I were you!"
3,Not so good for mid-size cars,"This car seat would not fit properly in my Chevy Malibu - a standard mid-size car. My husband and I tried everything possible to make it fit. Sadly, I had to return it."
5,Great seat!!!!!,I have heard so much about this seat is bad. I have a 7 month old & she loves it. I have a SUV & the seat fits perfect. All convertible seats are big. This one is narrow at the base though. The rep at Babies R US told me this seat is selling the best right now. All you have to do is read the book and be patient. It is not hard to install. So many people complain about the metal rod. Use a pair of pliers & screwdriver & the rod comes out fine. After all do you want something that will fall apart or that a 2 yr old can get out. This will last. The seat cover is easy to remove. Overall the best. My daughter & I love this seat!!!!!
2,This seat looks good at first,"We went with this car seat because our little girl is the last of our 5 children and we didn't want to have to get her another seat down the road. Boy did we screw up. First of all it is a great price and it looks so comfy but it is extremely huge for being in a normal car, my husband has a LeSabre and it takes up two seat spaces when we use it in there, also the middle buckle can be adjusted if you take the whole base apart which is not the easiest thing in the world. We are taking it back to go with our initial pick of the Triuph DXL it is just like it just doesnt' go to 100lbs but it is alot smaller base wise to fit it in any car. Yes we will need another car seat after she reaches 40lbs but my 3 yr old still isn't 40lbs so I am not too worried about moving her that soon since she is only 7 months old. Boosters range in price of 20 to 40 dollars I will live with that instead of the aggrivation."
1,Looks Great in and Out of Box But....,Extremely hard to understand instructions and does not fit in a 2004 Subaru OutBack wagon properly with or without base.Brought in by the local Police station to have the safety officer look at it and he even tried to install it and said it was not a very safe seat.Lots of safety issues with it.Seat leans to far back and extra straps in the back of seat just dangle.Manufacture says to tuck extra strap under seat while using the seat in the rear facing position.Not a very good idea belts are still loose and floppy.Not a very good buy.
1,Most Dreadful,"I own this book selection, I am most interested on Works written about relations between Middle Eastern Countries and the Western World. I myself am from the Middle East and find interest in that type of work. I believe that the author shows a biased opinion in the book. The author sounds pessimistic about the United States in relation to North Africa but does not back up the info provided with Intelligible expanations on the point of reference. I was not Content reading this book, therefore I did not enjoy it."
1,I read this one.,"I read this book for a term project I was writing about the Middle East. I found this book to be dry, dull, and I lost interest after reading a just a few chapters. Most of the work looks like it was cut and pasted from ideas of other authors on the region. I have found other books listed that cost efficiently and will give you better information without all the dry and useless rhetoric."
1,Bias and Anti anything that is not keen with his ideologies,"I took a class with Professor Layachi and HE WAS TERRIBLE!!!!! He displays anti semitic ideals and believes that it is ok for Palestinians to kill innocent Israelis. I am not saying that Israelis or Palestinians are bad or good... he should simply keep his personal views outside of class (and he should do the same with his books). BTW when he would grade our papers he DESTROYED all of our papers and would write that we should go back to kindergarten... well, Layachi guess you are the one who does not have a clue on how to write a book... before criticizing learn how to write"
4,European racing fans shouldn't miss this one,"Although the production and storyline are pure Hollywood 50's melodrama, it's definitely worth at least one viewing if you're an enthusiast of F1 and sports car racing in the 50's in Europe. The cars are all real - Ferrari, Maserati, Mercedes et al - and the track action is genuine, although with a lot more rear-screen filler shots than you would see later in the 60s. Shooting was done at several classic circuits including Monaco, Nurburgring, the Mille Miglia, Spa, and a climactic race at the great old highway circuit at Reims, France. There are in-car shots, though not many, including a shot going through Eau Rouge at Spa that was duplicated by Frankenheimer in ""Grand Prix"" 11 years later."
4,Great period videography,"Wonderful period racing film of the golden years of GT and Formula 1 racing. Kirk Douglas does a great job as a wreckless driver willing to do anything to succeed in motorsport. Only flaw is typical 50s romance interest. Please, please, create a DVD version.The Racers and Grand Prix remain notibly absent from the DVD format.James Taylor"
2,Disappointed,"By reading this book, I was hoping to get a better knowledge of how the FBI works. That included how the FBI interacts with local police forces as well as international countries about major cases.Kessler's case examples were boring. There was nothing suspenseful or interesting in the stories he chose to analyze. Perhaps he would have been better off saving more time to analyze Hoover's FBI as well as post Hoover FBI. It would have given the reader a more in-depth understanding and appreciation for how much it's improved and how we should be proud of the FBI."
4,Interesting read,"I am impressed with ""The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency."" Kessler explains the workings of the FBI in great detail. He stays on track most of the time, although rambles now and then. His story is very intersting."
1,Big Scoop on Petty Stuff,"I read the whole book even though it appeared early on that Kessler is a stooge for the FBI. If you want to know about Session's wife FBI pass or the fact that his assistant flashed her FBI badge at a state trooper to talk her way out of a ticket or how she failed to properly register her car in Virginia to avoid state income tax, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.If you want to know about the abuses of Hoover or Waco, forget it. Ruby Ridge is not even mentioned.I bought this book based on the Amazon recommendations. They are usually good. This is the first book that I have read that has prompted me to post a review. Any review that says this book is good must have been written by a FBI agent. DONT BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,Average But Fair,"This is another around the world in 8 days tour of an American institution by Kessler. The author is presenting a book that is billed as basically an overview of the FBI as it is today with some history through in to give it some background and a few real life cases peppered through out the book for spice. The author has always done a good job in these large overview books and he has maintained that level here.He has been working with contacts from this agency for years so there is some interesting inside info that will be new to the reader, but a lot of the really interesting stuff has been spelled out in an number of other books or TV programs. The book is a well written and constructed story with a good road map though the years and departments. The reader does not get lost in a jumble of department abbreviations. A good overview book that is probably what most readers are looking for."
4,Good intro but does not include the dark side of the agency,"there is scarce mention of the Cointelpro program, or of some of the seamier sides to the agency as has come out over the past 6 years in the James ""Whitey"" Bulger case. there is something scary about this agency and its ability to surreptitously monitor us with little oversight. This book does a good job of showing the training and background of the agency and no doubt there are many fine people in the agency. However, it does not discuss how working in the agency affects its employees and i suspect there are more than a few stresses on the home life of people who work for it. It is also apparent that the agency is highly controlled and that field agents and the like might have a lot of restrictions in truly seeking justice. And the intrusiveness into one's personal life by the agency is something that cannot be understated."
1,Edition has technical problem (missing pages),"# Paperback: 336 pages# Publisher: Aristophanes Press (March 15, 2007)# Language: English# ISBN-10: 1406710997# ISBN-13: 978-1406710991I got this edition but pages from 13 to 30 unfortunately are not included. As you see this edition has 336 pages but original has more than 350. Anyway, Radhakrishnan is great author and i had very good refund experience with Amazon also. Try to buy some other edition.Sincerely, Mathi"
3,Alternative Arrangements,May be a interesting choice for those bored with traditional melodies and arrangements. Not a sing-a-long due to variations. Mix keeps your hand on the volume control.
5,Wonderful Sounds of Christmas!!,"I was delighted with John Francis Wade's c.d., Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The expertly trained voices of the tabernacle choir ring out loud with the wonderful sounds of Christmas. This c.d. is a wonderful addition for any music lover's collection! Thank you for this gift."
2,Superb choral sound but....,"the words, melodies, arrangements, all have been changed. The first track is a traditional choral arrangement but after that it goes down hill quickly. Other than the always magnificent sound of the full choir and organ this album is a disappointment.Really, if you are looking for traditional sounding Christmas music this totally misses the mark. I've been involved in choral music for more than 30 years and I've never heard so many questionable arrangements in one album. Echoing another review, if you want to edit Christ out of Christmas the title should read ""The Mormon Tabernacles Tribute to the Traditional Winter Solstice Holiday"". The Brooklyn Tabernacle Christmas albums are always not traditional Christmas music but they will lift high your spirit with their souring sound.If you really want this album, look on eBay I'll be selling my copy for $1-2."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","This was a good theory to revolve a movie around (I won't spoil it here), and after the first 15 minutes and learning the plot I had high hopes. Regrettably the movie fell victim to poor dialogue, wooden performances, and odd camera work."
3,Gary Cole!,"As in any movie with Gary Cole, this one has a lot of potential. It's a movie that maybe could soft play the drama more, but you can't blame the filmmaker for the compromises they might have made."
3,STARTS OUT AS AN INTERESTING SATIRE AND TURNS INTO A ROM/COM?!,"'The Joneses' is one of those films that starts with a pretty interesting idea, but then goes for a more typical romantic comedy angle. It's a shame because I think there is a lot to be said about our society and how commercialism has taken over our country. I give it 3 stars for trying, but it's more like 2 1/2 stars. If this film had stayed focused, it would have had a much deeper impact."
2,Goofy and Improbable -,"The story is built around an artificial family whose members are unrelated and employed to boost local sales of sponsored products. They do so, but also cause unintended consequences - eg. the suicide of a neighbor trying to boost his wife's affections by buying her the suggested gifts, the car-wreck injury of the gay son's girl-friend in a DWI resulting from partying with a sponsor's product, etc. Meanwhile, 'Mr. Jones' is frustrated that his 'wife' (the unit's boss) maintains a purely professional relationship with him. Until the end, when they leave the company and go off to live happily ever after as a real couple."
4,Darkish comedy worth a look,"The story revolves around the perfect family. David Duchovny and Demi Moore are the perfect parents and Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth are the perfect high school kids (even if they look like they just graduated from college). All is not what it seems however. They are really paid employees of a subversive marketing company whose ""job"" is to sell high end products ranging from beauty supplies to Audi automobiles. In this town everybody drives an Audi. Some critics thought the movie wasn't dark enough. Evidently, infidelity, outing a gay kid and a suicide aren't dark enough. Others thought the ""Hollywood"" ending was too much. Still, I really liked it. Good acting, an interesting premise and a surprising movie."
2,Such unfulfilled promise,"Seemingly a commentary on consumerism, this offbeat film only occasionally hits its mark. Not biting enough to offer any new insight or angle, it makes you long for the movie it could have been. The people-matter-more-than-things moral of the story is heavy handed and the ending seems illogical and tacked-on. Good to see Demi back, though, and Amber Heard once again shows why she's always working - and ""this close"" to being a household name."
3,The perfect family,"When I watched ""The Joneses"" I did not have high expectations, because it had a limited release into theaters, which sometimes means the movie is not very good. However, ""The Joneses"" was entertaining and enjoyable.""The Joneses"" is about a bunch of marketers who pretend to be the perfect family that has all the latest items. Steve Jones (Duchovny) plays the part of a very successful business man who has a great family, house and items. While his wife Kate Jones (Moore) dresses in head to toe in the latest designer cloths. Steve and Kate's kids play the role of being the most talked about kids at school. They have the latest cell phones, cloths, and accessories.While the overall and execution of ""The Joneses"" is not the best, it's the acting that saves this film. Both David Duchovny and Demi Moore have great chemistry as they play husband and wife."
2,Coulda Been Bettah,"This movie wants to be better than it is and that's not the fault of the actors. They do a fine job with what they're given, but unfortunately, they've been given the equivalent of what the ""weenie"" of the movie is: A market-driven plot that wants to be all things to all people and ends up being none of them. It wants to be a comedy, but the queasiness of the ""friendly sales pitches"" denies that, and it wants to be a sex romp, but the flatly drawn character of the sex bomb young girl doesn't make it, it wants to be a ""tolerance for gays"" film, but that goes nowhere fast, and it wants to be a ""see what consumerism will do to you"" film, but, sadly, even that comes off as grafted on at the last minute. (Although the underwater shot is creepily effective--don't worry, no spoiler here)You won't hate it, but you'll come away thinking: ""Jeez. Is this really what Demi and Duchovny are slated for? These halfbaked concept films? Sigh."""
4,Thought Provoking,"A thought-provoking film with both obvious and subtle implications for American consumer culture. The ending is unfortunate, but quite consistent with Hollywood endings."
1,Yuck!,"Those poor actors, I mean they're famous aren't they? They have some semblance of talent, don't they? Apparently the people who wrote and directed were able to completely squash any of that under their 'let's make a movie that we think will sell about people who sell' idea.My sympathies to David Duchovny, Demi Moore and Lauren Bacall."
1,Painful,"This movie is slow and predictable. It is not funny, it is not much of anything. It was painful to sit through it.The money that these stars made for this, they should donate to charity."
3,Disappointing,"This is one of Ms. Deveraux's earlier books and while it does demonstrate her potential, I would not recommend reading it. The beginning was engrossing and then it starts to fall apart. You're cursing the hero and the heroine and trying to keep track of all the new and ""cliffhanger"" characters that are randomly thrown in every few pages, and after a while it's like....who cares anymore? I didn't."
2,Great disappointment !,"After reading Judes Sweet liar, which is a wonderfull book,I bought Counterfeit lady. I am sorry to say, that I regret that now. After promising start book turned out to be very borring. Reading 150 pages about two people who gave up and now feel sorry for themselves is not my idea of having a good time. I do not recommend this book. But if you want to read one of the best romances ever, read Judes Sweet liar. You will not regret it."
2,Impossibly boring,"This book starts out in an interesting fashion. Unfortunately, it quickly becomes a mire of dysfunctional people caught up in unbelievable situations. While the story line could have some potential, and the historical line should be interesting and exciting, it does not come together to be a good evening read."
2,Nice book ... but not Jude's best,"I am a big fan of Jude Deveraux, but unfortunately this book did not live up to my expectations, it started off wonderful and I really felt captivated by the refugee Noblewoman Nicole and had been reduce to working for a snobby english woman, but frankly after having that man threat her so horrible all those times I just wanted to reach in the book and slap her silly! I was routing for Wes to get her in the end! Now that would of been a twist!Not Jude's best work but its still worth reading"
2,Blah Blah Blah,"I genreally like Ms. Deveraux's work and picked up Counterfeit Lady expecteing another sucess. The book started off pretty good and I began to like Nicole, however it droned on and on, never really picking up, Clay treated Nicole horriably and she still loves him etc. It was painful to read because I just wanted Nicole to see the light and get over the egocentric Clay. And then there was Bianca who seemed to be trying to be a minor charcter but failed because she took up too much of the plot. The love between the two main charcters was so phony, and I kept reading it because I had hope it would pick up, however I was let down with the incrediably random and easy way out ending. I came to like Clay's friend Wes more than Clay himself. The book had good parts where Nicole shows her strength as a proud woman, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the wasted space."
1,I was so disappointed with this book,"I haven't finished this book yet, but I find it so annoying that I want to warn other readers to avoid it. The characters are not believable; they are all too often clumsily portrayed in broad strokes of black and white. The depiction of Bianca is an insult to all overweight women. Apparently her weight is indicative of her villainy. (...) Nicole is too sweet and virtuous to be true, not to mention being something of a doormat. And if she is part of the former French aristocracy, how is it that she knows the recipes for so many complex dishes? Aristocrats didn't cook for themselves; they had servants. There are so many other holes in the plot that they distract from the storyline. If you're considering purchasing this book, please don't waste your money. If you want to read a really entertaining romance, try ""The Thin Woman"" by Dorothy Cannell."
4,Why the bad reviews?,"I'd originally skipped over this one, even though I was trying to read all of Deveraux's books in order, due to negative reviews. I liked it and wished I'd read it before reading Lost Lady and River lady as it introduces characters from those books. Lots of great sex.My only complain is that there is no excuse for continuously harping on how fat the ""villian"" is, no matter how much of a b1tch you make her out to be. Seriously, we know she's a glutton and overweight, but I couldn't stand to read the word fat one more time."
2,Not her best work.....,"I love Jude Deveraux, however this one is missing the usual Deveraux flair. The main characters were weak and confusing, the heros' friend was stronger and much more likable than the weak-willed, wimpy, main character- and the plot almost predicitable, this is the first book of Jude Deveraux's that I WAS able to put down."
3,What is happening with Jude???,"If you want to read a Jude Deveraux novel try ""Knight in Shining Armor"", ""Wishes"", or ""Remembrance"", or any of her other books. DO NOT READ THIS ONE. I love escape literature, but the dialog and the actions of the two main characters are so unbeliveable that I just wanted the book to end as soon as possible. The characters are annoying and I could not find anyone to cheer for."
2,Kidnapped--Married,"Jude Deveraux's COUNTERFEIT LADY is the slowest of the James River series. Something is missing, it doesn't have the sparkle of the previous books.Nicole Courtlalain is kidnapped by mistake and married by proxy to Clayton Armstrong. He is expecting an English lady, but he got a French refugee.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
5,Is a great read!! Loved it!,"I've never read Jude before, but this was a promising first time!! You feel for the characters, and the love scenes were so erotic! You get to love the characters and laugh when they joke, cheer when the overcome, rage when they're set back. It was very easy to get into. I would buy this book again, (if I lost my copy), just to make sure it's there to dig into again."
4,Wonderfully written,"This is probably my favorite out of all the books that Jude Deveraux has written. I was drawn to the heroine but not so much to the hero. While I was reading, I kept wondering at Clay's stupidity where he had this incredible once in a life opportunity to be with a woman who loved him at the depth that Nicole did. It was obvious that Nicole loved him from the beginning but Clay in response did not appreciate her as say his best friend and everyone else. And his dog in the manger attitude annoyed me to no end. But thankfully, he came back to his senses at the end although he almost lost Nicole."
2,TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON BIANCA'S WEIGHT,"I thought this book was a DISSAPOINTMENT.NEVERMIND the predictable and at times boring plot, Ms. Deveraux doesn't seem to know any other way to describe Bianca other than ""fat"", ""plump"", ""swollen"", ""so fat when she sits, she can't get up"", ""her eyes were lost in her fat swollen face""...etc. I don't know how many different ways Jude Deveraux feels the need to describe Bianca as overweight or how many different characters needed to tell her so. Wherever the name Bianca was, there was an insult to her weight and she eventually took on name ""The Fat Woman"". It was unneccessary and took over the whole story. Instead of spending so much time on describing how repulsive Bianca was because of her weight, Ms. Deveraux should have been developing a stronger, more meaningful plot with likable characters."
2,"Thin is good, fat is evil?","I found myself speed reading most of the time. It started off quite well and I thought that I would enjoy it. But there was no sparkle between the 2 main characters. There is no depth to the characters. There isn't the essence of either humour or a heart wrenching love story. I found it annoying that so much emphasis was put on Bianca's weight, as though it made her a more evil character."
2,"Boring, Unbelieveable and not Jude Devereaux's Best","Many other readers have written reviews so this will be short. I found Clayton to be just plain stupid, weak, and an all around jerk. Although I know this is just a story it's totally unbelieveable. I just could not believe that a rich supposedly smart man could fall to Bianca's blackmail, especially at this particular time period. Bianca is hateful and mean. Nicole is too good to be true. I love Jude Devereaux's books, but I hated this one."
2,Nothing new here - much better books available,"This book is basic and lacking anything new - perhaps becauseit is more than 12 years old. I picked it up at a library, and wasthankful that I didn't pay for it myself.Don't you just hate when you pay for a book that doesn't tell you anything and is basically out-of-date. I read the other comments about this book and was awed at their comment. I guess it's the old saying ""To each his own"". END"
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"Even though it's 10 years old, it's a great book. The book explains everything regarding relational DB design in a step by step, thorough, and pratical manner. It reads very well and is not bogged down with theory. The sections describing logical modeling make Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobsen (the three amigos) look like they were behind the times when they came out with their stuff regarding OOD. I can't believe this book is as old as it is."
5,Clear distinction between ERM and the relational Model,"This book teaches a product independant step by step approach to design a relational database. The autors clearly differentiate between data modeling (ERM) and Relational Database Design. Even if the book is older than 10 years, it is very helpful to design databases with current products like Oracle 9i, DB2 V8 etc."
3,Good base for a DB worker,"Database design has taken so many leaps since this book was written, but the concepts you'll find in this book are still very sound. As a beginning data modeler you would gain a lot from these pages."
2,Needs more Steinman,"When you listen to this for the first time you'll know when Steinman's work kicks in without looking at the liner notes. At track 3, Steinman's exaggerated lyric and music kick in and for a minute you'll remember what is fun about the Bat Out of Hell series. Meatloaf sings well throughout, but only on the Steinman cuts do you find that ridiculous mix of faux operatic vocals and outrageous orchestration that made both he and Meatloaf famous. The rest is just a pastiche of the work that came before (but I do think the Dianae Warren contribution ""Cry Over Me"" works well for Meat) and pales in comparison. If you want to hear some more Steinman/Meatloaf this might be your last opportunity so take the good with the bad and skip over the other cuts."
2,Ego kills!,"So after all the crap Loaf went through to get this made, the lawsuits etc, it ends up being a big flop (very very low sales and off the charts in a few weeks)! He decides to make the CD without Steinman, who is the songwriter, producer, and genius behind Meat Loafs entire career (The first two Bat albums). With all it's slick production, and even using the Steinman written songs, this CD is a pale imitation of the first two. It doesnt sound the same at all. None of the Steinman songs sung by Meat Loaf on his own have ever sounded the same. The CD sounds over dramatic, like a rock opera but it isnt appealing. I heard it 3-4 times and was through. I cant play it anymore, it's boring! I still play the original Bat CD and Part II for many years now without getting tired of them. Now that Loaf has blown it, there will never be another Bat Out Of Hell CD, and his career will be forever glorified on the success of the first two Steinman productions which remain masterpieces!"
1,no more meatloaf PLEASE.,"After his little 15 minutes of fame in the 70's this tired OLD crow releases yet another 'bat out of hell"" series, I think the majority is over it buddy, I never liked you anyway, let alone your performance in the RHPC, can't you come up with another title to a cd besides bat out of hell, talk about a no talent troll, this indeed is one. this should be made into FREE frisbee's.no more ROTTEN meatloaf PLEASE."
5,Bat Out Of Hell III,Meatloaf has done it again pulled together a great album. There must be magic in that title.
4,Gets better with every listen,"It took several listenings for me to start enjoying this album, but once it catches hold of you it becomes addicting -- like the other 2 BOOH albums. Not quite as good as the other 2, but definitely worth listening to and owning."
2,No Comparison,"I tried, I really did. I tried so desperately to like this album. I listened to it again and again, but it just didn't click. Bat One is, in my opinion, one of the great albums of all time; I have listened to it since it came out in the 70s and have never grown tired of it. Bat Two was a bit weaker, yet still quite good. I looked very forward to this third installment, and my initial disappointment has not abated. After several months of attempting to like this album, I am sure it will likely never again be heard on my stereo. But, that being said, I will happily pull out Bat Two, and especially Bat One."
3,Two out of Three Ain't Bad...,"Bat and Bat II were inspirational. Those two albums carried me through college and long nights of studying for finals and writing papers. As for Bat III, it was ok. If Bat III had been my first exposure to Meatloaf I probably would not have become such a fan, it is not nearly as fine as the first two, but like I said, two out of three ain't bad..."
5,They're BACK!!!!,"If you are the kind of Meatloaf addict that wore out multiple copies of Bat I be prepared. Call in sick, turn off the cell phone, sound proof the walls and experience the magic the hooked you in the first place. Bat III offers all the passion, pain, and raw talent that made Bat I soar to the top of the charts. If you don't know who Meatloaf is, stagger out from under your rock, sit down and strap yourself in, cuz you are in for the ride of your life. This CD is not just straight fireworks, it's one grand finale after another. The drawback to this CD? It's impossible to choose a favorite cut-they're all that good. It's rock all grown up and just as good."
3,Ho Hum,"Sure, the blistering (well, not Todd Rundgren blistering) guitar solos are there. Sure, Meat sings his head off, he always does. If you loved Bat 1, you may like this. But to me, there just isn't enough fresh feel to this. In the case of Bats out of Hell, turns out the first cut was the deepest...."
1,Go To The Source,"I don't know that Bat Out Of Hell needed to be a trilogy. The original was perfection. Bombastic. Wagnerian. It has been described and analyzed and it still rocks. Now we've come to this. Overall, its.....nice. It has some Steinman cuts....but if you want to hear them done right, check out Pandora's Box 'Original Sin'. Then you'll understand why these versions pale.Steinman is the true star....his songs need only the right voice and production. You won't find that here. I'll always be a Meatloaf fan....too bad he didn't show up for this."
1,meat meat meat,hated this cd - i am a long time meatloaf fan but he should have retired after bat II- he cant do the gig anymore very sorry
1,if I could bestow a negative star rating...,"the Gospel according to MeatLoaf poses the question:""on what day did God create the ""Loaf""...and couldn't he have rested on that day also."""
1,Bat out of hell and into nursinghome,Booring and old fashion rock without the magic. Soundsto me like the rolling stones who are just feeding aclichee.
4,buena sorpresa,"Meat loaf presenta interpretaciones con la calidad de las letras, musica, instrumentación e interpretación sin igual"
4,a lot of music for a bargain price,"OK... first off... I like Bat I and II. But I won't gush over them. To me, Meatloaf has always had a lot of good songs, some great songs and a lot of filler and throw away songs. Bat III does away with the filler. There's no 45 Seconds of Ecstacy here (apologies to those of you who LIKE that mess). Even the oddball 1.5 minute song (Monstro) works very well as a segue into Land of Pigs. Yes- this is a long album. So what? I'd rather have 78 minutes that includes a few less than stellar tracks than 50 minutes of great songs... if the price is the same (and hey, I paid 10 bucks for Bat III!!!), at some point I will listen to the songs that aren't as exciting, and they often grow on me anyway. And there is some REALLY good music on this album. I bought it because I like a lot of Meatloaf and the price was good. It goes way above my expectations so it's all good. Even if you are a casual fan of Meatloaf- pick this one up. It's worth the money."
5,beautiful record,"meat loaf is one of my favourites player, and this one is a great album.of course the best ever is Bat Out Of Hell II"
2,"Sadly, not up to par.","I won't reiterate all the other reviews, or try to tell you the history of each song and track on this album. Let me just say that Jim Steinman's participation was sorely missed when they made this album. For one thing, I have the distinct sense that this was somehow meant to be a country album. (Just listen to the duets he does...told ya.) It's always been difficult for Meat Loaf to get into the groove when recording in the studio and this album is no exception. There's just very little pizzaz. If you want to hear many of the songs on this album done the RIGHT way, grab a copy of Steinman's/Pandora's Box's ""Original Sin"" and kick back. What a difference! BOH III is, in my opinion, more for completists and devoted fans."
4,BAT OUT OF HELL 3,"My first reaction was that I was disappointed. And this disappointment sort of justified me, being in the dark about the existence of this current CD. I just recently learned about it on Biography channel, when they featured Meatloaf. I own all of Meatloaf CDs, most are rated from okay to great. H-o-w-e-v-e-r, after listening to this CD several times, it finally draws out or stirs up the emotions of the previous 2 Bat of hell cd's. Of the 3 Bat out of hell cd's, this one is third best; and better then Meatloaf's other titled cd's. If you were to own only one of Meatloaf's cds this would not to be the number 1. But if you had a budget for 3 cd's, buying Bat out of hell 1, 2 and 3 would certainly be worth owning."
4,They Hijacked the Title in Court,"This is a really good Meat Loaf CD but it should not have been Bat Out of Hell 3, it does not live up to the name. It falls short of that creative spark that would make it a classic like the other 2 previous releases. I feel that it was hype to sell a few CDs that would not have sold normally, while I really like about 4 of the songs, if it was as good as 1 and 2 it would have had a flow and feel of them and songs that knocked you out the first time you heard them. Bat Out of Hell 1 was the first CD I ever bought and I thought I found rock and roll heaven, number 2 was slightly less but still awesome, this CD is just a good Meat Loaf CD that should have been released that way, it missed the mark to be Bat Out of Hell 3. I got to add that song number 4 (Bad for Good) is possibly one of the best rock songs I ever heard (of course you gotta love the way MeatLoaf does rock) , crank it up."
1,This album is a lemon and I want my money back,"I can't figure out why anyone gave this a good review. Bat out of Hell I and II have been on my top ten list for years. Listening to emotion, lyrics, and compositions in awe. The compositions in Bat of out Hell III are forced and contrived. Missing not only the emotion which draws one to Meatloaf but also the amazing compositions. As stated this album is a lemon and I want my money back."
2,the meatloaf spoiled!,"first let me say I have all of Meatloafs CDs, most replaced the records I have. That being said, this outing does NOT deserve to wear the Bat Out of Hell title. Meatloaf himself is still great, but this is the worst Meatloaf album I've heard. VERY few highlights on this one and none that I would speak of. This CD will remain on my shelf forever!"
2,Falls Short Of Hell,"I'm a Meatloaf fan (got the albums, read his autobiography, etc.), but this album was a disappointment to me. I found that only tracks 4, 8, and possibly 11 really deliver. Track 2 is supposed to be of some acclaim, but it just didnt' do it for me, and don't even get me started about track 12 which starts off magnificently and then just goes horribly wrong. This can't be a trilogy because a Bat Out Of Hell IV is now needed for Steinman and Meat to redeem themselves. Save your money on the album and just buy selected tracks from iTunes."
2,I really wanted to like this!,"I've been a fan of Meatloaf since the beginning and always thought he was before his time. Bat Out of Hell 1 was a masterpiece. Part 2, while not up to it's predecessor, had some acceptable tracks. This lastest entry is pure dreck with the exception of Meatloaf's duet of ""It's all coming back to me"". Very sad and dissapointing entry from a staple of Rock."
5,the grand finale,"Meat has delivered a 14 song monster of an album. Steinman or no Steinman, who cares? stop living in the past and evolve a little!,Meat sings his guts out and Marion Raven is hot!!! Buy the album, listen and shut the Hell up!!"
5,Another great one,"I was a bit afraid to buy this album after Rolling Stone gave it only two stars. But I'm listening to it now, and it's a classic. Well recorded, theatric music that we've come to expect from Meat Loaf. It gets better with every listening. Fans will love it."
1,Stinks,can t beleive Meatloaf took all those years to make this crap. didn t even like any tracts on the whole cd.
2,Bat is Burned Out,"By Bat Out of Hell 3, Meat Loaf's creative spark and energy is spent. Again recycling some Steinman songs as he did on Bat 2, Meat's versions pale in comparison to the originals. I do like this version of It's All Coming Back To Me Now but that's one of few highlights, and really that song was never great to begin with. If you like the original Bat Out Of Hell album, do not get more Meat Loaf albums get Jim Steinman's Bad For Good and Ellen Foley's Night Out, both which are masterpieces. Bat 3 just doesn't cut it, and hearing him butcher Jim's old songs can be painful. The lead off track is pretty good and has an obvious Nikki Sixx influence. It's really the only good track on this CD.Standout track: The Monster's Loose"
4,Review Bat out of hell 111,"This is a fantastic recording if anybody can combine opera rock and heavy metal it is Meatloaf The stand out tracks are Blind as a bat, Alive, If god could talk. In my opinion this is Better Then Bat out of hell 2 . It would be foolish to compare it to The original bat out of hell as that record was done 30 years ago !!! However it comes a close 2nd in quality"
4,meatloaf and steinman rule,"not as good as Bat I, but that would be hard to beat -- only about half the songs written by Steinman -- worth the wait tho -- has it really been over 25 years -- Meat sounds good as ever"
4,An Album for All Occasions,"I am not exactly a die-hard Meat Loaf fan. From his discography, I have just the three recordings from the ""Bat Out of Hell"" series, obviously including this one.I can tell that this is a great CD to enjoy. His collection of opera-rock tunes (like ""The Monster Is Loose"", ""Alive"", ""In the Land of the Pig, The Butcher is King"") blended with some soulful and touchy ballads (""It's All Coming Back to Me"", ""Cry Over Me"" and ""Seize the Night"") sounds very good and decent, a perfect choice for any type of mood, just like any of the previous albums from the ""Bat Out of Hell"" trilogy.Comparing this with his previous albums, one can realize that although the music and the production has changed a bit, the style and the intent was to keep the exact formula that made the previous editions to be so successful as they were."
2,Less than Impressed.,"Jim Steinman's abscence in the Producers chair shows.The songs, while full of Meatloafs strong voice, have no emotion behind them.nearly all the songs are covers of previous Steinman productions.the songs are too slow to keep the usual Meatloaf energy rolling over the listener, and as such, rather than feeling the music, you simply sit there hearing meatloaf sing.The duet aspect on Its All Coming Back To Me Now is great, but sadly suffers from the afore-mentioned problems.I'm terribly dissapointed, and this is the last Meatloaf album i will buy w/o hearing the songs first."
4,MORE LIKE HOUSE MUSIC,THIS CD IS MORE LIKE HOUSE. TRACKS 1-3 SUCK BUT THE REST ARE UNIQUE AND BASS POUNDING
3,Better than I expected,"This really wasn't too bad. This CD was solidly in the techno camp with a variety of different styles and sounds. The CD had some decent energy to it but I tend to like my techno just a little faster. If you like the kind of noisy, discordant techno that some people prefer, this might be the CD for you. The mixing is decent and the music definitely has some flow to it. Some of the tracks I especially liked were 2. Concentrate, 7. Schizerfest and 10. Hack AT&T"
1,No sé por qué siguen,"Después de la desilusión con el material ""prestado"" que presentó como propio el autor en el libro ""Los Siete Rayos"", no sé por qué siguen publicando el material de este señor. Que no me diga la gente de Editorial Giluz que no estaban enterados de esto!Quien quita que lo aquí presentado como propio del autor haya sido ""tomado prestado"" de otra fuente sin ser ésta revelada. La verdad es que no tengo tiempo para eso ni puedo recomendar un libro en tales condiciones."
5,Spot Remover that works,ChemDry works if used as required. The difficult stains in my Burber carpet have not been removed with other products. ChemDry is the first product that has easily lifted the stains.
4,sailor : Girls Girls Girls,"What a great 70's Band. I saw them live in Brussels in 1975. Great music, vocals and unique instruments. They were the most popular band in Germany in the 1970's. But what is the deal with Political Correctness??? Their anthem song ""Sailor"" has been completely censored by the record company, and totally compromised. Words changes and phrases altered to meet todays politicial correctness. We want to hear the original songs as they were written not some new correct version of these songs.They were important then, and they are important now. Can you imagine The Beatles changing the words to ""Revolution"" ?? I think not. Lets have the original tracks released. Sailor fans deserve as much."
2,one long advertisement for endless supplementation,"This book basically is one long justification for taking lots of supplements. I've been down this road, and at some point started to ask myself -- do the guys writing this have a reason to want you to buy supplements? Of course they do. Ironman is a muscle mag. Its revenues come from advertisements from the people who sell supplements. If Ironman starts dinging the idea that supplements work, its revenues dry up and it goes out of business. Are protein bars useful as a quick meal replacement? I think so. Does taking chromium lead to six pack abs? Please. Hit the gym hard, watch what you eat, and save your money."
2,good pictures,"This book wasn't great. I don't like the format of this book the way it was written by several different contributors. I don't feel it has any particular flow or direction. It touches of some supplements and on the macro and micronutrients but doesn't outline any particular diets for anything. If you want to read a little about effervescent creatine, a little about protein, a little about calcium, and a little about a few other topics then I guess this book would be for you but you can find way better information in other books or online. I don't recommend this book."
1,A rip off,"Oh well, even a ""Polyanna"" can't be delighted all the time. This was like a bad xerox copy of a bad xerox copy. When it seems someone's in it just to make a quick buck, what's there to trust? I was left unimpressed."
4,UnRealistic,"This book is very detailed and has tons of info about certain products and certain teqniques about applying makeup. But most girls don't where makeup like that because it looks phony and chessy so in conclusion, good info, chessy unrealistic photos."
3,shorts,"Shipping took about 2 weeks and I paid for expedited shipping. That was disappointing but the shorts are nice. Simple and not too long like most athletic shorts these days. I'm 5'10"" and they extend to just above my knees."
3,no lining,the quality is not what i expected. it doesnt even have a inside lining like most sport clothing does.
4,Mesh shorts,The shorts arrived in a timely manner considering it was close to Christmas!Shorts are good quality and comfortable.
5,Mens scrimmage mesh shorts,"These shorts had the expected fit, are comfortable, and hold up well in the washer. My advice is to NOT put them in the dryer, but rather, let them air dry; this particular material will last much longer if this approach is taken."
3,"Not bad, but not great...","This is a much better alternative to Cauliflower mash, but no where near the real thing. It was just very grainy feeling. Not as smooth as real mashed potatoes. But if you MUST stay away from the carbs of real mashed potatoes - there's no other choice that I know of."
1,GROSS,"Thses things taste Nothing like Mashed Potatoes. They Taste all chemically, and Gross. They were dry and even after adding more water, still tasted like crap. If Your Looking to get a MASHED Potatoe taste- you wont fnd it in this product. I took about 4 Bites, threw it away and threw whole package in trash. CHEMICAL TASTING SWILL!"
2,Nasty,"Bad taste, bad texture. Calling these ""just like mashed potatoes"" is like calling mashed cauliflower is ""just like mashed potatoes."" Not even close.The only way I ate these and made it tolerable was drowning them in gravy or sour cream. Gross.I gave them two stars because some people might find them acceptable, and while I couldn't stand them I was still able to choke them down rather than throw them away. I didn't have any qualms about tossing the leftovers though."
3,"Not bad, but not great","These things aren't instant mashed potatoes. They are kind of grainy and gritty, but if you close your eyes, you can almost trick yourself into forgetting what you aren't eating. The price on these things seems pretty high. Despite those two problems, this product is worth trying and seeing if you like it. I might buy this for next thanksgiving, but it is too expensive for daily eating (or at least it was too expensive at the time of this writing)."
4,good stuff!,These are actually not bad! Pretty tasty and easy to make. I would recommend for a healthy starch craving..all and all 8 out of 10
5,A Surprising First Book,"Goska is a writer possessed of (or maybe by) an enormous talent. She can be searing or funny or gentle, but her words are always compelling. This book sucked me in almost from the very beginning and it never turned me loose.Even when the material itself is painful or difficult, the book's an easy read because it's so arfully handled that you don't want to put it down. It is an astonishing, powerful work."
4,Simply helpful. Would recommend to any waterfowler.,A very helpful book for any waterfowler. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.
2,Waste of Money and Time,"The book lacked very much in any detail regarding the development, construction and utilization of Waterfowling Boats and Blinds. The book surved as a form of marketing for various suppliers of Duck Hunting Equipment. A true hunter would do better calling Bass Pro Shops or Cabellas."
3,The D.I.Y. Manual For Duckboats & Blinds,"This book is a welcome source of inspiration and ideas for the D.I.Y. waterfowl hunter. What it lacks in detail it more than makes up for in tips and handy facts to know. From blind building instructions to boat building and restoration, this book packs enough ""surface knowledge"" to inspire the reader to learn more (or contact some of the many manufactures that have advertisements in the book.) Overall, I would have to say this book is a must have for anyone who is serious about duckhunting or is planning to build their own duck boat. It doesn't lay everything out for you, but it does inspire you to want to know more. If you are an experienced do-it-yourselfer, you may just be able to fill in the missing pieces without further research. Regardless, you are sure to enjoy this book."
2,Good if you are new to waterfowling,"If you have been duck/goose hunting for a while don't waist your money, just read DU. If you are new to the sport and need to know how to get started and how to set up a boat and buy the right gear this book is a good start. You could learn just as much through DU, joining your local skeet/trap club and talking to the old timers, they seem to know it all and for the most part they do."
4,GREAT,Full of usefull tips that can't be found in any other book. If you hunt waterfowl you must have this book.
5,YeeeHaaaa!,"Our little guy loves this outfit. The quality is exceptional. To give you a reference, he's 2 1/2 years old, weighs 29 lbs. and it is just a little big on him. He doesn't care and neither does his spring horse. They're spending a lot more time on the range now that he is the Marshall of Deadwood. I'd recommend this outfit to anyone with a lttle wanna be ramrod Rowdy Yates."
1,A Picture book with no pictures,I ordered this book thinking that it would contain many pictures. I wanted to use this book for learning a minority language. But there were no pictures
5,A Sydney Drew Review,"This book was absolutely great! I've read the Vanishing Shadow and this one and think the haunted attic is way more engaging. Judy try's to solve the mystery of the ghost in the attic plus she deals with the problem of picking the wealthy girls ( Lois) as friends or the poor mill girls! Plus, the mystery of the house has a connection with Peters past. My favorite characters in this story have to be Judy Bolton because she's a great role model. And Irene ( the poor girl) because she is just plain sweet and musical! Read this book!"
5,Beginning Mandolin-Tom Bekeny,"I really enjoyed how Tom Bekeny takes his time to explain how to reallyget a solid start into Mandolin playing. Best of all, I liked thereference library in the bonus section of the DVD. This allows you tolearn the steps at your own pace without having to try to keep up withan instructor. There is a .pdf file in the dvd that you can access thatalso contains the tablature to the lessons in the DVD. you are alsogiven a password to go online and download and print the lessons. Tomcovers Bluegrass ""chop"" chords, McReynolds Crosspicking techniques,various scales and some Bluegrass songs like Old Joe Clark, Bile ThemCabbage Down, On and On and others."
2,Not Helpful,"I purchased this instructional dvd for one of my kid's. Was not that informative, we shelved this one and purchased another that was much more helpful."
1,Bored 4 yr old.,"Both programs lack any variation within the games. There is one task and one way to do it. There is far too much explanation for each game on the Winnie the Pooh game. My grandson who will spent hours, if allowed, on the computer was bored in minutes."
5,buying it up for the holidays,"all my friends need a copy of this for the holidays, it's a solid movie that i want to share and i don't say that often. good work to the director and the cast...awesome flick."
5,The director and stars can relate,I believe that you can't relate to a movie like this if you have not been thru a struggle yourself. Scarface is one of my fave films because of it's true portrayal. This does this genre justice for sure. And the actors are real not those hollywood creations.
5,Clark can definitely act a thug,"He really breathes this character. Very impressive acting ability, always been a fan of his music. Cheers to the director, I've shared this with many of my friends."
5,Emotional depth to this flick...,There's a real emotional depth to men who choose violence at every turn and even more of a twist when they choose to go legit. This is a mind f*** and it's truthful and raw in every sense of the word.
1,Piece of trash,Low budget nonsense. The acting is bad and script is worse. There is no plot. Do not waste your time.
1,King of the WORST,"The worst movie I've ever seen, made with a bunch of ROOKIES and those 5 stars reviews were made by themselves more likely, because the plot doesn't make sense and the spectator has no clue of whats going on in scenes that are poorly performed. Awful, don't waste your money in even renting like I did, thanks god that is was only $1.oo dollar in the red box, but, this movie is not worth it even that."
5,Great Classic,"I got this movie from Redbox just trying to find something to waste a couple hours. I had never heard of this movie and was just giving it a try. I was shocked because after watching it I can say it is a certified classic. You know its not a big box office production but its not bottom barrel low budget either. It has a couple of nice plot twists, good cinematography and good acting. I will buy this movie because it is good enough to watch over and over. I highly reccommend this movie. The bad review just didn't give it a chance. It's worth watching."
1,Ick.,"Not ""authentic"". Not ""belly dance music"". Stay away from this album. It has suckered in many novice dancers with its title. Save your money for something better."
2,Toxic Music Alert!,"Do not be misled by the title, this isn't a CD belly dancing. This is Turkish ""hillbilly"" music: mediocre to really bad 9/8 folkloric, which goes south fast!Don't waste your money unless you need a reason to get evicted, plan on torturing someone or want a target other than clay pidgeons to shoot at on the gun range!"
1,Sad...Sad....Sad :(,"This CD came in a set and I was hoping that it would be good, but is very monotonous and unuseable for a professional belly dance entertainer or instructor. :( :("
1,dont even think about it!!,"Because of the title I was suckered into this one, but I made the mistake of going for not only this one but also a CD called ""Nights in the Casbah""-Arabic Exotica which had a picture of a pretty belly dancer on the front. No need to stress that after I had heard the alleged ""authentic belly dancing"" music I was unhappy and could not even make it through a whole song, but when I realized that my second purchase ""Night in the Casbah"" had the same annoying singer I realized you pay for what you get. ... Steer clear and happy dancing~ Meleka"
2,Not very good for belly dancing,This is one of the first CDs I ever purchased after owning tons of belly dance cassette tapes. Was very disappointed. Just can't dance to it.
1,Cheap,The sound quality is bad bad bad. The chorus sounds like they are falling asleep. The music just sounds off. NOT for professional dancing!
4,An exciting book,"This book picked up on a similar experience that was experienced by America,the seizing of the American embassy. In the Icarus Agenda the embassy is seized by a bunch of rabid terrorists. A hero comes in the form of an American Congressman.He of course comes through. The interjection of the Isreali commandos makes this a further good read. Another conspiracy being hatched by the Vice- President and some of his followers adds another ring to the stort. The Congressman due to a leak of a mole is placed in immense danger. He manages to survive the attack of the terrorists and then line up for the Vice-Presidency after thr Vice- President dies. A very fast paced book with plenty of excitement. I wish that Ludlum would do a sequel. Read this book."
4,Pretty Typical Ludlum,"If you enjoy Robert Ludlum you will enjoy this book. There is plenty of action. Kendrick, the protagonist, takes on the bad guys by himself against the odds."
1,Really quite awful,"This novel is frustrating, insubstantial and very very improbable. A caucasian US Congressman dons dark makeup to pass for an Arab, infiltrates a terrorist organization in Oman, convinces them he is a fellow terrorist, and somehow foils their plot. All this despite his obvious non-native accent which isn't even mentioned by Robert Ludlum. He then keeps the entire caper a secret until one covert agent recognizes him from a photograph.The only interesting plot involves a secret star chamber-like organization scheming to select the next US President. Once again logic holds no sway in this universe because the secret organization is apparently risking their lives and reputations for entirely altruistic reasons, with no personal benefit expected or desired from the new administration.Please stay away unless you enjoy smacking your forehead with the palm of your hand every 20 pages."
4,OK...Where's the rest of the book?,"The book in general was spectacular, the story was drawn out just a little bit, but it was a great book. My only question: Where is the sequel?!?!?!? Once you read the book you will find that a sequel is necessary, but it doesn't exist, so no 5 out of 5 for Ludlum this time."
1,Worst book I've read to date,"I only give this book one star since I can't rate it at no stars. I have read several Ludlums in the past and have enjoyed his writing but after reading this book I'm sure I won't read any more Ludlum. Ludlum books frequently start slow and start moving after a few pages but the writing in this book is unbelivably dull. Although there were some parts where it looked as though the story was going to pick up the pace, he managed to quickly turn the story back to absolute drivel within a page or two. Apparently this book was a platform for him to bore the reader rigid with political ramblings. I suggest any other Ludlum but this one - Apocalypse Watch was my first Ludlum and I enjoyed it, a first rate, tense thriller. Best thing to do with this book is to prop up a table leg with it."
1,An utter dissapointment,"Having loved the Bourne series I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book, but it was almost painful to read. The story was boring, the language was pretentious and constantly mentions the various wars and skirmishes which, although relevant to the story in the broader sense, left me lost in all the details as I am not a Middle East expert, neither do I want to be. I could not get into the story and imagine the scenes. I was completely aware that I was reading a book, and not a good one at all times.Ludlum is trying too hard to write a good book and it's very contrived."
1,If this is the last Ludlum you have when you are stranded on an Island..,I am a fan of Ludlum and have liked a number of his books but this one is -1. too predictable not only on story line after the 1st book but also what the characters are going to say next.2. too long. Like other reviewers noted its supposed to be 3 books in one but it is really 2 books and that is 2 books too long.3. at the end I think he himself got bored of the book because the last operation is finished too easily and too quickly.4. the main characters can never die no matter how deadly is the disease or improbable the situation..This must have been the first review I wrote because I want others to avoid the mistake I made of starting this book. I finished the book only because I have never started one and left it midways but I was very close to letting go of that rule for this one..The Bourne series are definitely written at a different stage of his writing career.
5,it doesn't get much better than this,"Bongwater came about at the weong time, or maybe it was the perfect time and we are not ready for them yet. This is, I feel, their best effort, but really, you should go out and get everything they have done. This is music to listen to while staring at a wall, dancing on a table, or eating fresh fruit. In short: this is perfect music."
5,"Hey! What that swan be doing, huh? And why? Why?","This is the funnest album you will ever hear! I have all Bongwaters CD's as well as Magnuson's solo effort but this takes the cake! So invite the funnest friends you have, make a pitcher of margaritas and break out this CD. They'll love you for it."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"Crazy, crazy, crazy...fun, fun, funny folk meets artsy rock n' roll and some kind of experimental whoknowswhat!!!! Great album, female singer, great lyrics, lots of humour....buy this dudes!!"
5,Inspirational,"This book has helped me in my prayers for my own children as well as other children in my life. Sometimes I feel stuck and need a little inspiration and the prayers in ""Bless My Child"" have helped. The book contains many prayers for all stages of our children's lives from before birth to adulthood."
5,Great service and a great product,I ordered these to use on an old boat trailer I am rebuilding. They suit the job perfectly and won't rust. I recommend ordering the conbination offered for the fender brackets as advertised on Amazon for the right part.
1,Broken Promises,"Wasn't overly optimistic, but for the price if it didn't work, I wouldn't be disappointed.It didn't work and I wasn't disappointed."
1,Completely Unusable,"It appears that the authors lack experience in designing usable web interfaces and try to translate experience from software UI design. They draw conclusions like ""designing a site that users like and designing a site that they can use may be conflicting goals"" and ""In any case, we cannot depend on user satisfaction to indicate a usable web site.""The methodology behind the tests is good. The occlusions that the authors draw are down right ridiculous."
1,Poorly Written,"This book, while occasionally presenting useful information, was on the whole written very poorly. Many statements like ""We do not know what this means,"" littered the book with useless, inconclusive babble. The studies were purely linear in nature and provided no valid conclusions or insights into usability. It was almost as if the researchers were afraid to admit to drawing any conclusions from their findings. They also neglected to actually capture the content they were researching, the 1996 Olympic site for example, and could therefore not present pictures of the site when it went offline. Their painful admission of this fact only strengthened their lack of credibility. Read it if you'd like a good laugh."
5,Good Book,"Although this book will not appeal to anyone studying graphic design, it sure appealed to me. Basically it supported the fact that people don't care about your spinning, flashing, logo in the upper right hand corner. They care about content and usability. I'm a beginning a web page for my office. It will be for information extraction only. This study changes the way I think about user habits and preferences. If you are interested in creating an informative web site you should read this book. Don't listen to the folks who bash this book, they probably have degrees in Graphic Design....."
4,A short report on research-based Web usability studies,"The authors work for User Interface Engineering and this book documents the results of Web usability tests conducted in 1997 but the results are equally valid today. Rather than measuring the ""coolness"" of a site, this report rates the effectiveness of Web features in helping visitors find information on a site. This is particularly important in business-to-business sites where visitors are searching, not surfing. This book is very readable and gives quantitative data that should be of great interest to anyone building a Web site. A fast read, you should burn through the 150 pages in less than two well-spent hours."
3,Some Good Information; But By No Means Definitive,"Basically, the value of this book is that it is one of the only empirical studies of web site usability. It challenges the opinions of designers and pundits without offering any reasons why conventional wisdom may be right ot wrong.However, the book suffers from serious flaws. Granted, the $40 price reflects the number of people and hours involved in creating this book, it does not seem to offer the answers to justify it. Questions that should have been followed up on were left unanswered. Site designers were not consulted. Grammatical errors abound.However, the details of the tests ARE clearly delineated, although one would assume that would be covered in the beginning."
4,Good action packed book with different ending,The characters are the good guy and bad guy but in a spce setting. If you like adventure with a touch of sci-fi you'll enjoy this book. Not real heavy reading and the ending is a bit different from what I expected.
4,"A fun, quick read","OK, the story itself is now a little dated (among other things, the Soviet Union is still around), but aside from that this is a nice little brain-dead novel. Don't expect the kind of hard-SF extrapolation you'll find in most of Bova's other novels; rather, this one is more or less a James Bond movie in space, complete with over-the-top villians, femme fatales, and enough plot holes to fit an asteroid or two in. It's popcorn of the printed variety, not meant to make you think but just to have a good time. Read it on the beach."
3,Although a little dated in its politics this is still a good,"The story works with technology that is nearly possible today and may be reality in the not so distant future, it not a far fetched space opera nor a silly fantasy story. The story also deals with private enterprise challenging governments for domination of space which is a theme I enjoy. There is enough tech. adventure and intrigue to make for a good Ben Bova story."
1,EOS had no business sense publishing this.,"To put it bluntly, I was totally unable to ""suspend my disbelief"" in order to get past the first 3 chapters. This is a 15 year old SF book that just got published, in which the Soviet Empire has taken over. This book will only appeal to people that can tolerate alternate universe stories. The writing is so terribly formula that you can see the writers checklist, i.e. violence for attention grab, wet dream scene backup, dull filler, etc. I've read hundreds of SF novels good and bad. This is the first one I've quit reading and actually tossed in the trash. It's not good enough for the Walmart discount bin. It's no wonder it took 15 years to publish. EOS must have just wanted a big name."
1,Not worth reading.,"This is one of the most misogynistic pieces of tripe I've read in a good long while. Mediocre plot, very fun premise, but it's woven together like an afghan somebody let the dog chew on."
2,Dirk Pitt in Space,"Having just finished Mars, Return to Mars, Moonrise, and Moonwar, I was really looking forward to another excellent Bova tale. Unfortunately, this book left me very unsatisfied.I would like to say reading Privateers was like diving into a Clive Cussler novel, with Dan Randolph as Dirk Pitt, but that would not be entirely fair to Mr. Cussler. The action was nowhere near as intense, and the story was unbelievably predictable. This book was a VERY quick read.The only thing that preventing my giving it a 1-star rating was the fact that out of 5 books I've read or Mr. Bova's, this was the only dud."
5,Eyeopening Book,Great book to learn the other side of American History! Needs to be taught in school.
5,Brilliant.,This was the first Bright Eyes cd that I bought and I wasn't let down. I love how the cd booklet is in both Kanji(Japanese) and English. The extra money is worth it. All the art is awesome. And I have nothing else to say except to buy this cd.
2,WHY NO BLOTTERS??,"I'm very dissapointed in this book! After waiting 3 months beyond the original publish date, I find there are no blotter pages. I understand there will be no more blotters in future books, also. As I've been buying and selling blotters based on the Petretti's prices, I feel I cannot give this book a good rating. Also, why do we now have to jump all over the place to find the trays? They used to be simplified in one area."
1,Too Much HYPE !,"A lot of pictures. Prices that reflect nothing on reality. Not one Cleveland Electric Neon Clock. Not one American Time Clock. I have 3 originals hanging in front of me. Missing some of the major buttons. Typical collectors book. Pictures of everything that's out there, except the rare items you buy these books to find out about. Total dissapointment. I have stacks of collector books that have proven useless. There all written by the ""authority"" on the subject on hand. I think this explains the ... in collecting and the stacks of used books available. If you're going to make a ""Know It All"" book, than you better know at least %90. Monster let down."
4,"Wish it had more of the collectibles, but is better than most","I like the fact that the book shows so many color pictures. That is great! Unfortunately, as, with many of these types of books, it doesn't list many of the collectible coca cola items. The book could also be organised better. There are several different places to find clocks for example. If you go by the table of contents you might miss what you are looking for. When you go by the index you have to sift through different sections of the book looking for it. However, the back of the book was very helpful with the section on slogans for different years. It is a good book, but I wish it listed more of the collectibles or at least mentioned them. Still, I recently ordered a few other books on coke collectibles and this one seems to have more info than they did."
5,Petretti's Coca-Cola Collectibles Price Guide,I bought this book as a gift for my son. He tells me this is an awesome guide with so much information. He said it merits a very high recommendation.
5,Tops as a Coca-Cola reference!,"This volume is a super reference for a wide range of Coke collectibles. Has been upgraded with more color photographs and the prices reflect the current market. Lots of additional information helping novice and expert collectors know what is authentic and what is not. There are a number of Coke memorabilia reference books out there, but Petretti's is the most thorough and professionally done."
2,Didn't last very long,"I really liked this machine when I first started using it. Easy to put together, fairly sturdy. I have now owned/used it for about 1 year. It began to squeak (which wd-40 helped) and the handle bars began sliding down. I put a set screw in each arm to hold the handles in place. Then the squeak became really pronounced so I tried to take it apart to regrease. One of the orginal screws has rusted so that it cannot come out (despite being in my family room) and when I openned the flywheel case a large amount of rubber fell out. The drive belt is slowly being eaten away where it rubs on some of the mechanism. I also noticed that one of the handles is cracking.It may be that I am working the machine fairly hard, resistance 6 or 7 and over 50 rpm, but it seems like the machine should be able to handle that. Looking at some of the other reviews, I wonder if just got a lemon. But I am going to have to find a better machine."
1,OK Until Something Breaks,"This machine has been used moderately for about a year and a half. Right after the warranty ran out, it started making squeaking noises inside. I took the machine apart, reduced the tension on the flyweel and the squeak went a way. However, this did change the tension settings.THEN, the rod that holds the right foot arm broke. After examining the broken part, it was obvious that it was poorly designed and/or manufactured. It broke right through the weld. I called customer service and they were very helpful in getting a new part ordered FOR SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS PLUS SHIPPING!!!!! This is a cheap piece of steel with a rod welded on one end. Give me a break.This was a very inexpensive machine - you get what you pay for."
2,frame broke,welds around the frame broke after a couple months of use. Its right where the bottom and top tubes meet. I am about 200 pounds. Time to trash. I guess this has happened to others by reading otheer reviews.Other problems. squeeky and the handles slide down no matter how much you tighten the bolts.
2,Decent...,"The elliptical worked fine for the first two weeks. I was worried about the joints being bushings rather than bearings. It was fairly wobbly. At 2 weeks, the frame cracked at the base, and of course the machine was unusable at that point. I'm 155 pounds. I did get a 3 yr warranty. I'm taking the machine back and getting my money back from Walmart. I guess if you want something that will last, you probably have to dish out $600 or so. Keep reading the reviews!"
4,Excellent for the price you paid for,I think this Elliptical is excellent. I have this machine for 1yr and a half and no problems. I just have a question thought. Did anyone knows on the display in distance? Is this is in miles? meters? or kilometers? It's my only concern. I never figure it out.
3,Emphasis on PRIMER,"It is generally a very elementary book, and does not go into more advanced methods (for example, Sobol's low discrepancy series). It does give a number of very good examples of problems that can be tackled by Monte Carlo Methods. If you want a few pages on what Monte Carlo Methods can do,along with a little of bit decent theory, you may want to try this book. However, I am not sure that a person serious enough to spend the money on this book will be enlightened."
3,A good introduction to random number simulation.,"I enjoyed (and enjoying) this book. However, I gave it a three due to it being $54.00 for 100 pages. A little overpriced."
2,Proceed with Caution,"This is a fine enough introduction to Monte Carlo scenarios, but only for the highly technically proficient reader. The mathematics is quite sophisticated and probably out of reach for those who want to understand Monte Carlo methods rather than apply them. It is also a very thin book for a very high price."
4,An engrossing Medical Thriller,"Dr. Chovanes writes with a style and grace beyond the skill of most prescription writers. This book is intelligent, witty and provocative. His characters act heroically in extraordinary conditions, in ways both believable and sympathetic. Carefully drawn and approchable all, it is a credit to the doctor that a highly technical plot is so easily understood.I'd highly reccommend this book to anyone with a passing interest in medicine, mysteries or even in people. It is simply, an excellent read."
1,Aweful,It sucks don't but it the worst stupid movie ever it needs to be burned don't waste money the director should be punished
2,avoid this one,Paid good money for this unit.Worked for a while then either batteries went dead or switch broke. There is no apparent way to replace the batteries.Repeated attempts to contact manufacturer for guidance have met with no response.Avoid this one at all costs.
1,Screwed twice,"I was really looking forward to receiving this item.The one I got had been opened, crushed, and was missing the fiber optic piece and the batteries. I sent it back to Amazon for a new one. The replacement came, and it had also been opened, was missing the fiber optic piece, and had corroded batteries wedged into the light. Terrible.Some of the parts number on both boxes had been covered up with black marker. Maybe this is a warehouse problem. Beware."
5,This book was wholeheartely wrote. AWESOME book!,"Sheila Walsh, is just one of the women, of the Women of Faith tour I saw in Eat Rutherford, NJ in 1998, and really touch my soul. Her simple way and her friendly approach stirred at my soul, and made me motivated to do the Lord's work. I was very impressed with this book, and she really let us into her life with her personal troubles, and how she dealt with them. She taught me from this book never judge a book by the cover. Sometimes, it's on the inside that could be troubling you, and how to bring everything to the Lord. 5 star book!"
1,Honestly,"I would like to retract the review that I made earlier this evening. My review was honest and true, but I fear much too hard after thinking about it. If one person is helped by this book, then it will be THE ANSWER for them."
5,"At last, wonderful",I got this a while ago and like early purchasers got the wrong CD and as I live in the UK worried that I had wasted my money but my replacement copy complete with cool surprise arrived today and so I can my write my review and be pleasant.This is such a lovely album and to hear it in full surround is just a total joy so please invest/reinvest and get yourself a copy.
2,It's not that great,"I feel my money was wasted. I bought the CD/DVD based on the reviews here. I only liked a few songs ""Spider Bite"" and ""1000FT Hands"". The distorto drums were just annoying and what otherwise would have been OK music."
2,Slow moving and silly,"I wanted to watch a little vintage horror, and came across this moldy oldy. Basically there is a teenage girl who comes to stay with her grandma, who has converted her deceased husband's funeral home into a bed and breakfast. People turn up missing who have been a guests at grandma's place, and a local rookie cop is trying to unravel the mystery. The teenage girl is dating the rookie cop's brother, and they have their own investigation going on.Nothing much happens in this movie until the end, when there are some ungraphic gore effects and a mummified corpse. The transfer of this film is abyssmal. You can barely make out any details when it is dark.Overall, boring and with a ridiculous ending. Avoid."
1,I never got it,It was supposedly dilivered but I never got it what gives? I paid for it already so where is it?
3,LARGE IS small,"These are plain jane neoprene shorts; Nothing fancy about them. They are designed to make you HOT and to make you SWEAT. That said, I have no idea how they actually work as Valeo's sizing chart seems to be way off - these might fit a man with a 34 inch waist, but with my 39-40 inch waist, I can't even pull them up past my thighs. I just had to drop another 25 bucks and order an XL pair with two-day shipping.UPDATE: I'm down to around a 36-37 inch waist and the XL's just barely fit now."
2,I'll keep looking...,"I'm not quite sure just what body-type these shorts were meant for. Girth-wise, they were enormous; I'm about 6 feet tall and wander around the 300 lb. mark, not only could I easily slide these sorts on-zipped up no less- but after about three steps they had completely fallen off. There is simply not enough, or too much depending on your view, ""shorts"" there to keep themselves up. And the way they're proportioned!? They would really benefit from about six to nine more inches of height. I figured they'd cover my navel, not hardly. They barely cover my barely! That's pretty much why they fall off; if smaller sizes are proportioned the same even dropping a size or two wouldn't help."
3,"LARGE is actually ""EXTRA LARGE""","I ordered the Valeo Neoprene shorts in LARGE size. These were falling off of me and I have a 36-38"" waist. These shorts should be used for someone who is approximately waist size 42"" (should be sold as X-Large instead). I am too busy to return it, but I can't use it.For my size, 36-38"" waist, I should have ordered a Medium.I rated this 3-stars because they seem to be good shorts, but everyone must be aware that these are bigger than actual size you might expect."
3,Ordering By Size,"I ordered the size according to the ad. But when I received them the waist was too big. Other than the waist, the item was just as advertised"
3,Not bad,"These shorts are ok; I like using the waist sliming belt better. You do sweat alot when you use the shorts, so make sure you take another pair of clothes when you hit the gym."
1,Don't waste your money,"Out of the box, the smell made me sick. There is no true form, they are huge. I've purchased neoprene shorts before but nothing like this. They absolutely stick!"
3,Too big,These shorts run bigger than the sizing chart read. They are however well made and easy to clean. my waist measures 34-36 so I would recommend med.
3,Runs way large.,"I'm 200 pounds with a 35 inch waist. First I bought size large...too big. Sent them back for medium...still too big.The shorts seem O.K. but the sizing is way off. Strange though, most reviewers find the item too large but some find it too small.Very random. Don't waste your time on this one like I did."
2,Did not fit,The shorts I purchased were a small(women's) and they were extremely big on me. This product needs to come in a triple x small.
2,Poor design,"While the material and zipper seems to be just as good as any other Neoprene suit, the design of the waist line is absolutely HORRIBLE. There is no way to adjust the waist line, so these shorts simply slip off your buttocks by just walking around your room. Absolutely a waist of money. You might as well just purchase the entire body suit or simply just a neoprene shirt as these shorts are poorly designed."
1,do not fit,the size is really not well adapted ! too large on the belly but ok for the leg... can not use it !
1,sizing issue,"I bought these neoprene shorts to help keep me warm in the pool where I sometimes swim dogs. I also bought the Everlast Body Slimmer for the same reason [...]. I thought I would use both, just alternate between the two, but the fit of the Valeo was really weird. They fit in the hips pretty well, although they were a little roomy, but around the waist I might as well have been standing in a barrel. There is no contour from the hip to the waistline. I realize these are meant to help people lose weight, and I often have this same issue with jeans--I might have better luck with a size small, but instead I will buy a second pair of the Everlast because they fit perfectly. I also like that they come up higher so when I wear a vest over the top, there is overlap."
1,Sizing chart on this is ALL OFF,"These pants in large are huge and since they're stretch, should have gotten medium. The sizing chart is totally off which according I should be wearing extra-large, but got large and now need a medium... so be careful!"
2,Ill-Fitting & Won't Stay Up Neoprenes,"I should have taken the advice of the many other reviewers and kept my 10 bucks. These are SO ill-fitted! I had to sew darts at the waist in hopes that this would help them stay up... it doesn't because the waist is unfinished leaving no additional support to gather at the waist.Women, generally, have hips, and without a waist band, these are not going to stay up!The legs are also unfinished. They are straight cut, no hems!Unsatisfied with these I went out and bought ""Gold's Gym"" brand neoprene from Walmart for $9.77. They have a zipper and velcro at the waist... although they are for men and have a little pouch in the front where women don't need it, they are sold as a unisex item... not the best fit, but much better than these... and for the price (the next cheapest for a decent pair is $19.77).They look similar to these, except rather than a corded waist, there is a zipper & velcro on the right side of the shorts:[...]"
3,not what I expected,The pants had no waistline and so they wouldn't stay snug. They fit rather large for the size. I returned them and received a full refund.
4,These worked well.,I really liked the look of these there hard to find believe it or not and they have some that aren't as durable these worked nicely.
1,These are very poor quality.,"I purchased these as a replacement for some Joe Weider shorts I have had for many years that have started to wear out.I bought 3 pair of these shorts, worn 2 of them 1 time each, washed them, and they both came apart near the seam. The seams themselves did not come apart, but the actual fabric itself split in two like a 'run' in panty hose. The third pair is still inthe box and I have not worn it, but I figure that the same thing will happen with it as well.Also, one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg. The one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong.Like I said, very poor craftsmanship and materials."
3,XL is SMALL,"No idea how they work. This is my second pair now. I've blown a ton of money and can't use the Large I bought (about a man's 34 inch waist) or these XL's (about a man's 36 inch waist)...The sizing chart is way off. They seem like a decent pair of no-frills neoprene shorts though.UPDATE: I'm about a 36/37 now and can just squeeze into these. Not a bad pair of neoprene shorts, if you can find your right size."
3,Fit is to big,"The fit is like some of what others say. In the back it gaps enough to put your fist into. Great in the legs, but if they fill up with water (if you use for swimming) then I don't think they will stay on. I am a small/medium sized person who wanted these for cover-up and sun protection when in water. They would work fine if I was not going to be in public gym (because of gap) or swimming."
2,Very Poor,"Extremely poor sizing (they run enormous). Very shoddy construction, extremely low quality. Nothing about these shorts are good. I'm an athletic 240 lb male and the XL shorts could fit another person in them... I'm fairly certain that even if they did fit correctly around the waist the seems or zipper would fail if I attempted to squat."
2,Watch out for the size,"Wow, wasn't used to an XL being a 46 inch waist. Did sizing charts change overnight? Aside from that seems like a poor quality product.. no seams on the bottom cut or top cut, just open cell neoprene.Hope that helps."
5,Does the job!,"These neoprene pants are just the ticket if you wish to sweat off some pounds around the ol' posterior. They really make you sweat and, contrary to belief, I am not adding water weight back later when consuming liquids. They show these as unisex but I wish they made a separate set for women shaped a little more to the female figure. Otherwise the waist can gap while the posterior fits tight. Otherwise, I found these a great Amazon deal and glad I gave them a try."
3,Ok shorts,"I have worn these a few times and while they fit good at first. When Im working out or running with these on, they always seem to slip down my legs and I have nothing to cover the lower part of my stomach."
2,Too big,"I ordered this product in a large and it is suppose to fit 36-39 waist. It is way to big I checked and all the markings on the product and the box were large, so I don't wear it because it falls off of me and my waist is a 38."
2,"Very good sometimes, too electronic at others.","I was, overall, disappointed by this CD. There are many good reviews here, but they generally overpraise. Tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears. A major highlight is track 9, The Crab and the Egret, but interestingly, the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous Chinese percussion. Disappointingly, the CD is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment."
3,Relaxing but artificial,"I ran across this CD at a store and bought it without knowing too much about it. Unfortunately, I did not notice the ""synthesizer"" reference in the credits. I have nothing against synthesizers, but I was expecting authentic bamboo flute music, and this isn't really it. It's not really the same without period instruments."
5,Beautiful blend of traditional and modern Chinese music,"I have a tall stack of Chinese music CDs, including some I bought in China. But of them all, this is the best. Some tracks are pure traditional pieces. A few are modern with traditional overtones. They are funny, sweet and rousing by turns. And never, never boring. I LOVE this CD!"
3,"Good tunes, mediocre arrangment","I would say that most of the songs are of good potential, but there is just too much western and electronic instrumentation for me to honestly call it traditional/classical chinese music. I like the CD overall, some tracks are very moving, a few are so electronic they're annoying, but almost all have at least some ""foreign"" instrumentation. It isn't a bad cd, but I would call it ""easy listening"", and not ""classical chinese"".Fine for relaxing the car ride, but just like much of the dreadful so called ""celtic music"" flooding the market, this sounds like an alblum designed more for the incense burning crowd, and less for the ethnomusicologist."
4,Good bible book,The pictures that accompany with the bible verses are amazing. It helped guide me through the chapter easily. My students also like it because it's easy to understand and has a lot of color pictures.
5,Children's Bible,"This was a beautiful rendition of the Bible for Children. It was comprehensive, yet at a level that all children can enjoy. This was also an excellent deal, as opposed to other sites."
2,Much of the Bible is NOT actually printed....Revelations only 1 1/2 pages,"I purchased this book beleiving it would be a WONDERFUL First book for a New Christian. When I received it I was Happy with the Illustrations and it being a hard copy. Then I begam to go through it. This was where I SAW that the Book of Revelations is ONLY 1 1/2 pages. This is the ONE Book in the Bible where we are WARNED Not to ADD OR DELETE, YET Most of the Book is TOTALLY REMOVED. Because this is a person WHO Needs a Bible to get started, I kept it and have it to him, but I will be BYING the Full Version of the King James Version down the road so he can get the ENTIRE Book to read as well to his children."
3,Too Much Unity,"A note on the back of this book reads that it ""has been approved by an editorial board consisting of leaders from the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faiths"". Although this is meant as a selling point, it appears to be a precise description of what ails this otherwise promising book.- Overall coverage of the Bible is good, but I have not read each and every chapter to assess the accuracy of the translation. I assume compromises have been made to satisfy ""the board"". However, the language is clear and easy to understand.- Illustrations are good. I find the presence of maps a nice addition.- There are introductions to each chapter, and this would be okay, except for the obvious problem of interjecting doctrinal ideas that may not be compatible with your faith.This is easily a book that could be read and shown to children, but because of the syncretistic nature of the content, I would not recommend turning the book over to unattended youngsters."
2,"Offensive, racist, inaccurate","I bought this because it was recommended in a Catholic homeschooling book. I was initially impressed by the beautiful art in the Old Testament section. Imagine my shock when I discovered Jesus, a middle Eastern man, depicted with blond hair and blue eyes! Of course, no one of us has actually seen Jesus, but since he was born a Jew, it is highly unlikely that he had this coloring. The text is nothing remarkable. It is not particularly friendly to very young children. I found Today's English version of the Bible (American Bible Society) to be much more suitable for a child without unnecessarily ""dumbing down"" the message. I have a feeling that I will be selling this book to a second hand store pretty soon."
5,Children's Bible,"I purchased this bible to share the stories with my granddaughter. The pictures are vivid and stories written at a level appropriate for a grandmother to help explain the passage. My granddaughter is 3. If you are looking for a bible for children, I would recommend this one."
5,childrens bible,i had a bible like this when i was young and i still love it. that one is back at the home i grew up in so i had to buy one for my current home. the pics are vibrant and the stories are concise but retain the salient points as expressed by the original Word of God.
3,not what i expected,No complaints on delivery or packaging. I have a 5yr old an the book isn't friendly to her. I will keep the book for her as she gets older its just not what I expected mainly for a 5yr old.
1,Jesus is blond !,"Unlike the very misleading classic look of Jesus on the cover, all the depictions of Jesus in this Bible have Him as a tall, blond, Aryan type. Not exactly the image of Jesus I want my children to be left with. I was looking for a children's Bible that doesn't have a cartoons style to it, I regret selecting this one..."
2,Not as in described condition,"Book is covered in several different ""USED"" stickers, one on the spine, one on the front, FOUR on the back. Black markings on the spine, cover worn. Inside pages are in good condition, with light highlighting-- which was NOT mentioned on the description before purchase. Out of 10 books ordered from different companies, this one arrived last. Disappointed, and will not order from this company again."
4,James Robinson III rule at American Express.,"Although old, this is a thorough review of James Robinson's rule at American Express. Robinson was a consensus builder who sought to grow American Express by acquisition. However his poor strategy brought him to get out of cable too early, and the brokerage age when it was too late.His rule weakened American Express. What is prevalent throughout this book is the shark like atmosphere in American business, where one person is seeking to displace another. Some heavy hitters are in this book such as Sandy Weill, Lou Gerstner, and Cohen.This is a nice book about how an American icon company is badly run. It shows how and why American companies have not fared well in the international market. The caption on the cover of the book equates it with Barbarians at the Gates, and I think this book is as good as that. A nice thorough review of what went wrong at American Express."
3,A flawed vision of the future of spaceflight,"Rocketship X-M offers a very flawed vision of the future of spaceflight. Despite having some good actors (Lloyd Bridges, Hugh O'Brien, Noah Beery Jr.) the leaden script, comical ""scientific"" jargon, romantic subplot, post-atomic moralizing and amateur-night production values make for a slog. Most effective are Mars scenes shot in Death Valley through a red filter. ""High-tech"" exploratory equipment on Mars is assorted army surplus, plus two ice axes. Destination Moon, shot in the same year, has an infinitely superior grounding of accurate conjecture about the nature of spaceflight. Blame can be squarely placed on Kurt Neumann, the writer-director-producer, and his motivation of beating Destination Moon to the screen. The rushed nature of the enterprise shows. I give it 5 out of 10, which rounds up to 3 out of 5 in Amazon's rating system."
3,Fun Old Sci-Fi Relic,"This movie was delightful to watch. It was actually well done, considering the era it was made and the special effects/ budget constraints of making a B-movie back in those days.Lloyd Bridges' performance was very good along with a good supporting cast. The story was good and kept my attention most of the time. I won't say any more about the plot, but it was entertaining, especially since I don't recall ever having seen this movie before.If you like and appreciate old sci-fi movie gems from the 1950's, I think you could do a lot worse for the money than this one!"
3,Decent,"Rocketship X-M is a classic, but they get so much wrong scientifically that it's just stupid. I would recommend it to a lover of old sci-fi, but not really to anyone else."
4,Fun Sci-Fi,"I want to thank Image for a wonderful transfer. The sound and picture quality is wonderful on this DVD. The story has been told here so no need to go over it again. Very enjoyable story of the first rocket into space. I would add that the ""pinkish"" color used to ""colorize"" Mars looks very good, much better than the ""cinemagic"" used in the later movie, Angry Red Planet."
4,WE'RE OFF COURSE,"This film opens with a countdown and just keeps going after lift off. Short on science fact, but long on style and ideas, this is one of the better early ""first into space"" movies. It has a Jules Verne feel, a German work ethic pace, and keeps the surprises and the clique's coming - two of which were staples in these early type of movies: the sudden metor storm between the Earth and Moon and the ""we're off course"" stunt where the ship makes a U-Turn and heads for Mars or Venus (in this case it's Mars). But despite this, this is an entertaining film with a good cast and a surprise ending that is almost unheard of these days. ROCKETSHIP X-M is not for everybody, but if you are a collector and a sci-fi fan, than this is an excellent addition to any library."
3,A Simpler Time,"I bought this without ever viewing it previously.First we must realize the time period it was produced in and that it is after all science fiction. Yes it was hokey, but if weare a true follower of this classic genre we will want to see this one and the price is right. This 75 minute venture into theunexplored with Loyd Bridges and Hugh O'brien is worth the trip."
4,Cold War Morality Play,"This film was made about sixty years ago, early in the Cold War, when the atomic bomb was still relatively new.Admittedly, the technical details of the film's rocket ship are now a little funny, and the acting was not that great either. I think that the film makers were trying to warn the audience that there are no winners in the aftermath of a nuclear war. On the fictional Mars, the rocket's crew discovered what was left of an advanced Martian civilization that was destroyed by a nuclear war. So by showing what could happen on the fictional Mars as a result of a nuclear holocaust, the film makers gave warning that the same thing could happen on earth."
2,disappointing,"The DVD was in good shape. The disappointing comes into play when you watch the movie. Lloyd Bridges should have stayed underwater with Scuba gear. The plot was a real letdown even for ""B"" 50's scifi."
3,Rocketship X-M,"Of course I was a kid when I saw Rocketship X-M, nevertheless I am tired of the bad press I have heard over the years. I remember, even now, that I thought it must have had a limited budget. The special effects, I thought, were more than acceptable, even for the time period, and you can believe that I paid special attention to effects even at the age of thirteen. The one reason that I don't give it another star is because of the scene that showed a jacket rising slowly from the back of a chair long after gravity had become nonexistent. And I think I remember correctly when I say that none of the crew ever floated . . . for the duration of the trip."
2,This is what used to be called B grade folks,"The rocketship control room had some nice details, didn't have quite the cardboard look that some old movies and TV shows did.There's very little else to recommend this movie for, it's kind of insulting without even much 1950 science and worse scripting. Might have been good for a ten year old to waste a Saturday morning with but definitely not the best of the breed. Destination Moon, even Project Moonbase are better."
3,If you're an MST fan...,"The skewering of this movie made for one of the truly funniest episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (first show of the second season.) It put the whole flick in proper perspective, not least of which is the fact that if X-M is short for ""expedition moon,"" shouldn't it have been called Rocketship E-M?! Can't wait for THAT version to be on DVD!"
4,A FABULOUS MUSIC SCORE,"Ferde Grofe, certainly one of the best known American symphonic composers, was hired to write the music score for ROCKETSHIP X-M. He was paid $1500 to turn in what may be the best sci-fi score for the movies. When you watch the film, tune in to the heroic main title (which is repeated, in part, later), the ""weightless"" sound in certain scenes, the romantic theme for Floyd and Lisa, and the eerie sound as the crew discovers they are headed for Mars. After the landing, Grofe uses part of some music he wrote for his ""Symphony in Steel,"" and combines it with the use of the Theremin to create an unworldly sound indeed. On the trip back, the solar opera aspect of this movie is emphasized with the music setting the exact mood it should do for the tragedies encountered. This is a great score, worthy of re-recording in today's sound.And, if you want to hear another score Grofe wrote for the same studio (Lippert) in 1950, get a copy of THE RETURN OF JESSE JAMES, another worthy listen."
5,Their Best Yet,"Mechanical Wonders has got to OCS best album to date. Being given a US release means that hopefully a wider range of people will be able to benefit from this album. Mechanical WOnder contains tracks like Biggest Things, In My Field, Mechanical Wonder and the UK hit single Up On The Downside. If you have never been a fan of OCS then this will be the album to convert you"
5,Juxtaposition,"At first this album seemed ""Ehh"" to me. I listened to it a few times and sort of forgot about it. A few weeks ago I resurrected it, and I cannot stop listening to it. Damon & Naomi are the best."
1,EASY TO TIP OVER!!!,"We just bought this today for our 2 yr old daughter. It has great reviews, looks good...HOWEVER, our small daughter can pull the WHOLE thing across our hardwood floors. It is EASY to open the place where you put sand or water to weigh it down. We've already had major spills. AND she can climb the pole and tip the whole thing over.We are NOT happy. Our daughter loves the toy but I would NEVER leave her alone with this toy. EVER!!! If you have a strong and/or determined to climb toddler - do NOT get this toy!!!"
5,Zahn's Greatest Book,From start to end Zahn keeps you in mystery. Out of all the characters in the book the most innocent party in the book is actually the one enemy that could end the Chiss empire. Zahn knows Star Wars and he is the only person I will read when it comes to those books.
2,A Dissapointment,"The book had great potential but, as other reviewers have stated, Zahn left too many loose ends. With a few changes of names and places, the final 100 pages could have occurred in any Star Wars book. The story of what occurred on Outbound flight remains to be told."
3,OK but disappointed in loose ends,"I agree with some of the other reviewers around the loose ends side of things. There was so much build up about the 18 Jedi on board and what Luke could learn about them. Once the action got going, there was almost no discussion about learning what really happened after they got shot down. Why did the people on board fear them etc. Really surprised an author of Zahn's caliber let thing finish the way they did. What did Luke do with the Jedi adept (i.e. take them to Jedi Academy etc)? Way too many unfinished concepts."
4,great star wars whodunnit,"Intrigueing one off star wars book. Its great to read this one and then go read outbound flight, a prequel of sorts. Zahn is rarely better in these books."
3,An Entertaining Cookie-Cutter Romp,"I'm glad that ""Survivor's Quest"" was a library read. I was a big fan of Zahn's earlier Star Wars works, and was excited to see his name on the cover. Overall, it was an entertaining read but nothing to get excited about. Luke and Mara go on a cookie-cutter romp: A->B (fight, escape, solve puzzle); B->C (repeat). There are some cool elements, and a few revelations, but it's not up to the level of his earlier trilogy (hence my stingy 3 stars). It's definitely worth a rental, and is still superior to the latest movies (like that's saying much). I'm sure the die hard fans will really enjoy it."
2,Boring,This has to be one of the worst books ever written for the Star Wars Expanded Universe. The story doesn't seem suspenseful at all and is very slow. I gave up this one after the first 150 pages.This was a major disappointment especially coming from such a good writer as Zahn.
4,Better than the hand of thrawn,"Survivors Quest was much better than the hand of thrawn series by Zahn. Some parts were slightly predictable, but it was still a good read. Though the book doesn't quite enthrall the reader like Heir to the Force. All in all a good book."
5,Another success for Zahn,"I really enjoyed this book. I read the Hand of Thrawn duology right before this and with those events still fresh in mind it made this book that much better. It seems that when Zahn writes a Star Wars novel he is used to foreshadow coming novels. This one looks to be no different. I've yet to read The Joiner King, but it seems to be hinting toward it. The one thing is that I wish Zahn would not write a book that has to do with Thrawn however cool a character he is. Ofcourse his next book is Outbound Flight which deals with him also. Maybe someday. Any way this is a very good book that any fan should read."
5,Excellent Star Wars Adventure,"Survivor's Quest is a fine Star Wars adventure and makes a fine addition to the Star Wars expanded universe, which is now much improved since Del Rey have been given the contract for producing the Star Wars novels.Survivor's Quest has a mystery filled plot starring the newly married Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker. It contains a number of good and interesting twists aswell as plenty of Jedi action. Star Wars books are best when the writer and the reader approach it for what it is good entertainment. So if you want a Star Wars adventure that will keep you entertained over a couple of evenings then this is a good book for you."
4,Very interesting,"Luke Skywalker has a wife, also a Jedi Knight, and other alien characters are thrown into this timeless and highly successful space opera series. Written by Timothy Zahn, who has written other books in this series, proves why he is a Hugo Award holder. Buy and add this book to: ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Puppet Masters"", ""2001"", ""2010"", ""Rendezvous with Rama"", ""Ringworld"", all the ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" books, as well as books as new to the genre as ""Advent of the Corps"" and others."
1,Money for Nothing,"Wasn't I excited when I found out that Timothy Zahn would be writing a new Star Wars novel. Great I thought. One of my favourite authors writing for my favourite past time again. I devour Star Wars literature at an expensive rate. Also it was to be about the Outbound Flight Project. Another Great. How was my dissapointment after I read it. Not up to Zahn's usual high standards. What does this novel tell you. Nothing much except contardict a lot of established expanded universe information. The fact that nothing much is revealed is the big killer. All it is, is an excuse to forfill a contract. Living in Australia books are expensive. Paying $40 for a hardcover that wasnt any good is very frustrating. Like Planet of Twilight all over again. Zahn let himself down and he let down a lot of star wars fans. It wasn't a ""fantastic read"" or deserved the comment ""zahn is back"", no the comment that it really deserves is this. ""Lucasbooks and Timothy Zahn suck people in again with crap"""
5,i love timothy zahn!,"i love the way he writes, and the universe he develops. this book is awesome. the only problem is, when it ends, i am left wanting more. i really hope he continues his story with luke and mara, and the rest of the star wars 'verse."
2,Boring and predictable,I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... this one was predictable and dry.
2,OUTBOUND FLIGHT DID NOT CRASH ON NIRAUAN!,"This is definitely the least appealing of Zahn's full-length Star Wars books. But I said that in another review which I seem to have deleted.I'm beginning to think that certain reviewers may not be reading the books very thoroughly, to put it mildly. Why? As the title of this review states, OUTBOUND FLIGHT DID NOT CRASH ON NIRAUAN.It's just that the text material in the book jacket says that it did. No big deal... I guess some so-called ""editor"" has some problems with reading comprehension.From reading one review, it's like the reviewer only read the book jacket, while being compelled to put out a 5-star review. I don't see why anyone who actually read the book would think that Nirauan was the crash site. Nirauan was merely the site for the meeting between L&M; and the Chiss government.Nirauan's defining feature is a huge fortress in the shape of a hand. No crashed Outbound Flight dreadnaughts, sorry."
3,"okay, but not great","This is a pretty good book, but there are many plotlines that are left unresolved when the last page rolls around. I was left dissapointed, because I know that Zahn is a better writer than this!!Is there a sequel in the works?"
2,good premise that never went anywhere,"boring and disappointing. you think hmmm luke and mara and crew going to investigate the wreckage of outbound flight, sounds interesting right? well it didn't turn out that way. :("
4,My son just keeps on reading,"My son loves these books, he wasn't much of a reader till I got him a few of these. Now all he wants is more ;-)"
2,I barely made it out alive,"I have fond memories of the Heir to the Empire 3 books and couldnt remember why I stoped reading Zahn's work. I wanted a scifi book for a long flight and I picked up Zahns Survivor's Quest. Then I remembered why I stopped reading his work, this book, like all the others I read after Heir 3, are dull trodding titles that have none of the fun of the first 3. Save yourself the trouble and dont even bother getting it from the library.Even after this I still love the Heir to the Empire 3. If you have not read them yet you really should."
4,"Um, Get the timeline right...","In response to Page7's review on January 10th - This story takes place before the New Jedi Order, that's why no mention of the Yuuzhan Vong, ravaged Coruscant, etc. It's also not the first of a new series, but an extention on an old one (Hand of Thrawn duology: Vision of the Past and Specter of the Future). Anyone reading the reviews should know this so they don't get confused.All in all, Zhan has continued the saga of characters he created well. The question of why Thrawn destroyed Outbound Flight is even more murky by the end of this book, something that should be wrapped up neatly by the Outbound Flight book coming out in 2006. The book is paced much slower than his previous outings, but for me it kept the eerieness of the situation more alive.When it comes to the Star Wars Expanded Universe, Zhan is still king. We can only hope that his forthcoming offerings maintain the past expectations."
1,THIS IS NOT HAPPY AT ALL,If you like happy hardcore forget that you ever even saw this cd. Block it out of your memory. This cd is not happy harcore so dont waster your time or money on it. Also if there are any hardcore kids out there who have or know where to get the dreamscapes cd set with the slippmatt happt hardcore cd please email me I lost mine in a move and cant fid it anywhere.
2,"ok if u like trance, but doesn't really sound like happycore","this cd was a big disappointment to me, i was expecting some hardcore, and got trance instead i recommend the happy2bhardcore series by anabolic frolic"
3,"Where is the ""HAPPY HARDCORE""?","This CD is allrite, but it is far far away from HAPPY hardcore, it is more like trance/acid/harcore. There is no happy vibe here, it is more violent and trippy then ravy. If you are a heavy HAPPY HARCORE fan I would not recomend this CD. Otherwize it's an OK CD."
5,Great!,"I got this book, along with the others in this series, for my father who had read them when he was younger. He was thrilled when he received them."
4,My Friend Flicka conclusion,"Wonderful book, conclusion of Mary O'Hara trilogy that begins with MY FRIEND FLICKA and THUNDERHEAD.Ken finds a girlfriend, Carey. Thunderhead escapes from The Valley of Horses after poison grasses kill his band, and antagonizes ranchers in Southern Wyoming by stealing their mares to form a new band. Carey's thoroughbred horse is stolen by Thunderhead and the story continues ...I read this book as a young teen and it is as fresh and wonderful today as it was then. Anyone who loves horses will LOVE this series."
4,As charming and homey as a B& B Inn,"I also have enjoyed this cookbook. It includes a tasty variety of foods and more-often-than-not pretty simple preparations that are perfect to make for your own family and especially when you have weekend guests. You don't need to run a B&B to appreciate this book, but it may have you planning a stay in one when you read these hand-picked innkeepers' recipes. My favourite: Hacienda del Sol's Old Fashioned Porridge. It's not too sweet, but good enough for dessert! The little personal notes attached to each recipe make it seem like a treasured hand-me-down book with kitchen comments already scribbled in the margins."
4,MLA Style Guide...a great resource in most cases,"When I picked this book up I was simply looking for ways to cite internet resources. It turns out the people at MLA have got a lot more to offer. The book did a great job at showing the hows and whys of writing well. As for citations, a critical aspect of most research, the Guide gave a multitude of different types of sources and how to cite them, not only in the Works Cited but also in endnotes and footnotes. Perhaps my only complaint would be the repetition in seperate chapters on citation. It was not initially clear what the purpose of the repetition was. That said, I will use this book again and again as a perfect tool when writing my papers."
4,Needs to be read,"Written 12 years before Capital, here is the heart and soul of Capital. The edition I read has a fantastic introduction (and some minor updates) by Engels. Read it. It is completely accessible, modern and totally relevant to today's economy."
3,This autobiographical work is complex but eye opening.,"Maxine Hong Kingston's autobiography is a complex work that takes careful analyzation. To fully understand how she uses this piece to tell her story, one must examine several aspects of Chinese culture. It is an interesting work that requires thought."
2,This book is a mess,"I started reading this book today and I've only made it through two chapters and the only reason I read two is because I thought I should give the book another chance after reading the first chapter. I'm really not sure where the author is going with this book, it just doesn't seem to make sense to me. I felt he was not writing this book to tell the story of Lucas's life but in stead writing in literary confusion. It did not grab me at all. So I came here to see what other people thought of this book and I'm glad it wasn't just me. This book is a mess. Glad I got it from the library and didn't spend the $27 for it. There are other books that tell of the creative work and business of George Lucas."
3,myth versus translation,"I have just finished reading the italian version of this book. I can agree with some if the other reviws that some part are slow but overall the book is intriguing. I strongly advise that those in love with Lucas may be dissatisfied, in fact his image as a filmaker is fantastic, as a husband or friend less.If possible I would recommend the original english version because in my opinion the italian translation is very bad (please advise the author)"
3,Inaccurate But Still Good,"I am a big George Lucas fan and I found a few errors in this book. The one that really bothered me was that the author repeatedly stated that Jim Henson did the puppeteering and voice for Yoda. IT WAS FRANK OZ NOT JIM HENSON! That was soooo annoying! I kept wishing that the author was around so that I could just scream it in his face!Other than these small details, the book was pretty good. But still, I can't help but wonder what else was inaccurate that I just took as new information."
5,A good indoor workout,I was looking specifically for a Leslie Sansone walking DVD b/c I enjoy her on ExerciseTV. I like the versatility of the different walks and was pleased to find that when my husband did the 3 mile (he usually walks outside) it kicked his butt. The price was good (got free shipping when I ordered 2 more) and jumped right in when they came. It gives me somewhere to turn when Exercise TV fails to offer a walking program.
5,This lady is awesome!,We have been using these DVD's and my sister has lost almost 70 pounds using it and eating right. It low impact and WORKS! It doesn't require that you have an weird equipment either.
5,"Love it, it motivates me!","I have just gotten this, therefore, I am still doing the one mile walk. I really like it and it is not hard to do. No coordination required, which is a good thing :) I look forward to working my way up to the other levels of walking. I do intend to buy some weight balls and the stretchie band is included with the DVD's. Thanks!"
3,Leslie Sansone - walk awa the pounds Ultimate collection,Miles: 1:2: 3: excellent. doing the 4 mile it was disappointing to see that it was an old hash of an earlier video. The problem with the so called 4 mile express isn't really that. What do I mean: right towards the end of mile 3 the speed slows down far too quicly and the 4th mile drags out due to the slow pace. Those of us into real exercising want something that keeps the pace for the full 4 miles so I do the first 3 miles and then I switch to another 4 mile one and do miles 2 &3 as the pace is what I need.
3,No Band Included!,I was excited to start this but was saddened when no stretch band came with it. That was part of the reason I bought it this. I feel ripped off.
1,Walk Away Pounds Ultimate Collection,This is the second dvd that I ordered and it also has pauses in in it. That's the reason I sent the first one back and now this one also has these annoying pauses in each one. I am going to have to send this one back also. I am not happy with this tape.
1,not recommended at all,it doesnt even play on any dvd player/laptop i have tried. do not buy this expensive product its useless
2,I did not receive my resistance band,I received the dvd but I did not receive the resistance band that is suppose to come with it. I'm disappointed about that. It says that it the featured item with this video is the resistance band. If they send me my band my review will be higher.
1,Defective,"This DVD doesn't play on any DVD player in my house or on my laptop. I ordered it because of the good reviews it got, but I'm sending this back."
3,EXERCISE TAPE,"IT'S OKAY, SOMEWHAT BORING. I CAN'T STICK TO IT. I NEED SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE EXCITING. I THINK I'LL GO FOR THE DANCE ONES NEXT."
1,DVD is defective,"I have not seen the thing because when I put it in my dvd player, there was nothing. I put it in my computer and not only could I not see it, but I had to take my iMac in to have the dvd removed. Cost me $90! I'm annoyed. The only reason I'm giving the thing one star is that the program wouldn't let me advance without a star. Do you know what the Bronx Cheer is?"
3,walking program,I love this DVD and the exercise it gives me. However ...there are 4 different walking programs and the 2 mile walk has not worked since I purchased it. All other 3 walking programs work. That was a disappointment.
3,Good workout boring music,"Decent workout, but I really do not like the music. I really like the 4 mile walk though, I truly believe this is helping me out with my weight loss!"
4,exercise tape,"I had all the VCR tapes ---with the DVD version, I can use on my computer and take them with me when traveling...."
5,Perfect for people with mobility issues,"I was doing some research for a video to help supplement my diet. I had never heard of Leslie, but I decided to give her a shot based on the reviews. Am I glad I did. I am a 50 year old with arthritis in my knees and significant weight to lose, and this video is perfect. She shows you the moves clearly, and gives ample warning before changing movements. Best of all, she tells you what to do to modify a movement if it is beyond your ability right now, and has people in the group model those modifications. It comes with the stretch resistance band, but you will also use ""weighted balls"" which are just 1 lb hand weights. I didn't have the balls, but I found some 1 lb mini hand weights at the local sporting goods store that work just fine. I really like this routine, it's easy to pick up and Leslie is easier to follow and far less annoying than Denise Austin, whose video I bought at the same time."
5,Great walking at home,"This is a great program for walking at home. I put my Moby wrap on & can do it while holding the baby. Fast, simple & a great workout."
5,Easy to learn but effective!,"I loved this workout--it is easy, and yet you can feel your heart rate increase. There are no fancy steps, just basics to get you moving and burning those calories.I feel like this is a great addition to get me through the cold, dark winter nights when it is too icky out to walk.Many thanks Leslie!Update: I've been dropping about a pound a week from doing these about 5 days a week. They are just the ticket for me right now. I highly recommend these workouts!"
5,Low Impact but a truly a Workout,"I hadn't exercised since I had surgery in March 2008. In true couch potato style I could not get up to workout, everything seemed too difficult. I got this and started in right away on the 1 mile. After all I knew I could at least do that. It jump started my desire to workout again and got my heart pumping. I haven't lost any weight yet because my diet still doesn't match my workout attitude but I'll get to that very soon. I love working out with Leslie Sansone, her attitude is upbeat and it's all very cute. I highly recommend this workout for those that are obese, been sitting for a long time, or just trying to get back into working out. This is very doable."
5,Great DVD,"I love this DVD. Walking is a great part of any exercise routine because it's so much easier on your joints. The great thing about these workouts is that you can intensify it according to your own level. The workouts on their own are wonderful - Leslie is motivating without being annoying or pushy :-) But when you are ready, you can add more arm movements, small weights or even a step to vary the workout. I love that there are 4 different workouts on this one dvd so depending on my time availability, I always have a great workout ready for me.The moves are not complex at all; it's a very easy to follow routine that would be great for anyone."
5,Really like it!,"I have only done the 1 mile getting started but I already love it! I cant wait to do the 2 mile! Its a great workout for beginners...if I can do this dvd, so can you!"
2,Too Hard,"Much harder than it says it is. For someone just getting up and moving, too fast paced, toomany leg exercises, Discouraged me. I'd hate to see what the 2 mile is like."
4,Good Workout,"This product gives a good workout. If you think you can't sweat, or ""feel the burn"", just from walking, think again. As with any video, the music gets to you after a while, but the workout is worthwhile. This was actually recommended in my Weight Watchers meeting."
3,"Only wish it had a ""music only"" version","It's not bad, it's just not that great. Glad I didn't pay too much for it. I like the music only version such as these following three titles: Burn Body Fat; The Big Burn: 2 Miles of Intervals; and 3 Miles Slim & Sleek Walk & Pilates. I offer that to you because I've spent a few hours researching to find out which ones offer music only, in case that is what you are looking for too. Leslie Sansone is so sweet and I love her inspiration and guidance on proper alignment and technique. However, after doing the same walk a couple times, you just don't want to hear it everytime, and the gibber gabber with the other walkers can get a little irritating. But, don't get me wrong, I LOVE these walk at home DVD's! I've already lost weight, and I feel SO much better emotionally and physically! These workouts are so easy to do that I look forward to doing them almost everyday!"
5,Walking DVD,This product is awesome for the intermediate walker. I use this DVD at least once or twice a week with the other Leslie Sansone DVD's I have bought. She keeps you pumped and motivated throughtout the DVD. She tells you the next step that is coming up. The music on the 4 mile Super Challenge is very upbeat. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to walk indoors.
3,Good workout.,"The price for 4 workouts (with stretchie band included) is great. The workouts are okay. Not much to say given it is a walking dvd. It is what I expected, but do not care for the instructor. Rather trivial, but I find her voice and laughing too annoying to use this dvd often. Will be passing this on to my mother.Although clearly indicated, I missed it so please note that this dvd is in STANDARD format, NOT widescreen."
4,I like it so far!,"PROS - So far I have only done the first workout on this DVD and I really like it. The first workout is perfect for beginners...no complicated choreography, very little space required to do the workout, but it got my heart rate up and I feel it not just in my legs but in my upper body as well. I assume that the other workouts will be just as effective, and it's nice to get so many on a single DVD so I don't have to buy anything else as I progress!NEUTRAL - This comes with a stretchy band, but you don't use it in the first workout, so I have no idea how well it works yet.CON - Not conS because so far I only found one...in the first workout they use the ""walk away weighted balls"" which the description of the video didn't mention that you'd need. I have looked online even on Leslie's site and they no longer offer these, and I am not sure how much they weigh to get something comparable, so I just used some light hand weights that I had."
3,leslie snsone,"Don't buy this dvd if you already have the 1 mile,2 mile 3 mile and 4 mile dvds as this is just putting them all onto one dvd which is rather dissappointing.They are good workouts but if like me you already have them then it is a waste of money"
4,Great exercise DVD,I am enjoying this exercise DVD. It has 4 different exercise programs. Great walking DVD for winter time. I love it has different times/distance that I can choose depending on the time I have. I like the other walkers/exercisers adds interest to the program. Well worth the money.
5,Great as always!,"This was the first dvd from leslie sansone I ever bought I loved every minute of instead of the weight balls i used my own 2 pound free weights which were equally good too :)I feel inspired when I walk with her. When I do 1 mile, I end up doing 2 miles after for a total of 3 miles.Somedays I like to repeat the 4 mile walk twice. :) She is just amazing!"
5,Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds Ultimate Collection,"I just discovered walking videos and have tried three different instructors. Leslie is my favorite so far. She is personable and real. I like walking with her ""walking buddies,"" a collection of women who look like my friends. I really feel like I am walking with my own friends. It's nice that she includes a ""stretchie"" for toning. I highly recommend this dvd."
3,Good video,"A nice, easy walking video for people like me who are naturally lazy, but still need to get some exercise in every day."
4,OK,This is a good workout. It's a good beginner's video. It really gets your legs to burning. I just wish it had just as much emphasis on the arms or upper body as it did for the lower body.
5,Great product/ service,This was bought as a gift and my sister loved it. She has always been a medieval fan and this was perfect to add to her collection. Quick service and shipping.
1,Dazed and disappointed,"This listing has been corrected (for the most part) since I originally wrote my review that follows.This is an incorrect representation of this book. It has absolutely nothing to do with Pink Floyd or guitar music at all. It is a beginner's piano solo book. It happened to look like something that will be useful to someone else in my family, so for the price I will just keep it. It is not worth the trouble to return. The picture on Amazon representing the book as a Pink Floyd Anthology is INCORRECT. It is nothing of the kind. The vast majority of people looking at this book will have no use what-so-ever for what they actually get in the mail if they purchase it."
3,Not a great choicee,"I Love Cannon printers because they have individual color ink tanks. But OEM Ink Tanks can be expensive. I buy the compatible ones to use since they are cheaper. There is one drawback: sometimes the cartridges just don't work. You can put in a new cartridge and the printer will still say it is out of ink. OEM tanks work best (or you can contact Canon and get them replaced if they don't work). You take a risk with the compatibles, but for the price you pay for them, you can afford for one or two of them to not work; however, I've had more of a problem with this band than some of the others."
5,Affordable ink.,I have used these ink cartdges for years and have not had a problem. My wallet would like to take this opportunity to thank you for not having its contents fly out so fast that it can't be seen.
3,nice smell frustrated lighting,I was glad to get this but even though when lite the smell is nice it takes FOREVER to light. Also is somewhat smoke at end since it is charcol. I also think it doesn't burn down enough. It keeps its cone shape which i think hinders end burning.
1,Read The Fine Print,"Actually a review for #4 - instrumentals. I should have realized that with a K-tel product, I would get K-tel quality, that is to say: lack of same. This is a rip-off. Fifteen selections, only one is an original recording. The rest are really, really BAD re-recordings. If you look closely at the back, you'll see a tiny notice to this effect (that they are re-recordings, not that they are bad [heh,heh]). Read the fine print on any K-tel product. Better yet, do yourself a favor, and avoid buying any K-tel product in the first place!"
3,She......is dead?,"Beautifully done. However,it seems to be written in past tense as if the woman has passed away. Not a gift to give those among the living. Would make a great tribute in a slide presentation at a funeral."
5,Great for Gal Pals!,"This is a great gift for my girlfriends who are strong women and ""do it all!"" I don't give it on traditional present-giving occassions, but rather at times when my friends have been a great source of fun, comfort, or strength."
1,Not what I anticipated,Thought that this book would have more substance...didn't get the inspiration that I was anticipating from all the hype and recommendation.Do not recommend buying this one - borrow it first & save your money.
1,Disappointed.,"I am disappointed in the packaging of the two NEW ""She"" books that I purchased. It looks like the packager just finished some french fries and grabbed my order off the shelf and threw it in the box. It's too close to Christmas to return the items. I'll have to take a towel and dampen it with Windex and try to wipe the greasy finger prints off of the books. I would prefer that my new books arrive in new condition.Disappointed."
1,Pass on This One,"Rarely am I so moved or disappointed that I actually take the time to write a review. In this case, I was disappointed. This book was a gift to me, and, were it not for the personal photo touches and favorite cousin of mine who did the gifting and photo glueing on every page, I would say it was stupid. Very cheesy and worthy of eye roll after eye roll."
1,Pop drivel,This is typical pop drivel of the Oprah or Maya Angelou variety. Nothing of real substance in it. A bunch of trite aphorisms. If you have a Y chromosome you will hate it.
2,Not the Greatest,The video lacks any type of exciting workout experience. I couldn't recomment this video to any person looking for a good workout. Sorry.
2,"Good, but not good enough","I found the Idiot's guide to San Francisco to have good information on places to visit and things to see, but it could have been better if it included more accurate transportation information. My advice would be to scan this book in the store for a few clues on places to go, but save your money for a book that will better help you arrive at your destination."
4,Solid introduction for layperson or Students!,"This method of providing information, clearly reflects the knowledge gained from injuries (Dr Willis) has personally sustained and helps the reader identify, recognize and make decisions about how to recover from a variety of joint traumas. The specific nature of these injuries is presented clearly and briefly.*** 'Effective Orthopedic Rehab' is a solid introduction for the layperson, a young professional working with injured athletes or a freshman undergraduate at college studying athletic training or kinesiology."
2,Don't waste your money,"Followed the instructions to a T and never got it to stop dripping. The dog also knocked it down every single time I tried to use it, even with additional improvised measures."
2,useless,This thing drips continuously. It leaked the entire 0.5 gallon of water into my dog's crate. Don't waste your money on this.
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I threw this away after fiddling with it for an hour. First of all, it hangs in the crate with two provided wires which are flimsy, and do NOT hold the water bottle properly. I could not even get the wires to hold the bottle until I realized I had to adjust the wires myself! Even then the flimsy wires would do little to support the bottle, which was leaking the entire time and making a trememdous mess as my puppy jumped up and down in the newly formed puddles in his crate. Great idea, but POOOOOOOOOORLY executed design of the holder and ball which DOES NOT hold water in the bottle. It leaks everywhere. Totally disappointed. Whoever makes this POS owes me $20 to include shipping."
2,Not so good..,The seller of this product was very fast but as for the product itself...not so good. I got it because my when I first had my dog she was only a pup about two months old and did not know how to drink milk from a plate yet. Maybe it was just my dog but she absolutely refused to use. And the liquid would always leak out during unwanted moments.
2,leaks,"The ball inside is not heavy enough, which makes this product leak slowly. The attachment is flimsy and no match for my puppy, so it can't be used inside. According to directions, if you are going to use it for a chain link fence, you have to go to a hardware store to buy an additional piece. I plan to return this product."
3,Had problems with leaking,"Wanted this for my pup who stays in the crate for a few hours and wanted them to have water. When it arrived, it looks sturdy and looked like it would work well. I followed the directions that were supplied to the tee, hoping to avoid the problems that others had complained about. Didn't work properly, attached well to the metal crate, but had a constant drip. So much that in an hour there was more of a mess with a wet dog, than the convenience. I might as well put the bowl of water directly in the cage. Tried a few times to 'start over' letting it dry out and follow the instructions again.....it is sitting in the garage now wasting space (and my money) I wish they could come up with a better design."
1,Leaks like crazy,If you don't have this sitting exactly at the right angle it leaks! It doesn't matter if it's full to the top or 1/2 empty... it constantly drips!!!!
5,SUPER TIGHT ELECTRONIC AND DOWNBEAT,"This later album by Shantel is more sophisticated than club guerila or auto jumps and remixes, and i believe him to be one of the most finely tuned electronic artists on earth. Flowing melodies based upon latin and far eastern rythms make this album a joy to listen to. If you are put off at first, listen and listen again and you will become addicted. I first heard shantels' bass and several cars, from ""auto jumps and remixes"" on Kruder and Dorfmeisters DJ Kicks compilation, and have since purchased all of his albums without disappointment"
1,So disappointed,"I loved Shantel's Higher Than The Funk. I have pretty much played that album to death. So, when I came across the Great Delay, I was psyched. I didn't purchase it right away, but when I finally did, I chose the vinyl, thinking it would be a great record to have - I had only purchased Higher Than The Funk on CD. Boy was I disappointed! I tried to find at least one song that I could play, ie, listen to fully through without cutting it out because it was unappealing to my ears. So far nothing. I even went back saying no, maybe I wasn't listening. Still no luck. What a difference from Higher...I should've spent the money on another copy of Higher Than The Funk.Don't waste your money like I did."
1,Overpriced ?,"I would urge caution and price up the items individually - You will be able to save much money by buying them as seperates, even with the 50% off offer ! (Feb 2006)"
2,Way Overpriced,This Item is on the Gerber-tools.com website for $184.99. Its a great kit but not for this price. I would suggest going directly through Gerber or looking for a better price.
3,Nice but overpriced,This kit is great but costs a little too much. Gerber makes good quality items that will more than meet your needs. The problem I have with this kit is that everything in it when purchased separately would be around 75-100 dollars cheaper than the list price.(Depending upon the quality of tools you are looking for.) If you don't have time to find all these tools separately then go ahead and buy this. It's a descent selection of tools and will get the job done. Just know that you can make a better kit for less money.
3,All commonly available 1964 recordings,"[Based upon Amazon.com sample listening].Some fun remakes of his own hits from an earlier decade plus a new tune written by the co-writer of many of his '50s hits, John S. Marascalco, who along with the uncredited Harry Nillson, contributed the all-out rocker, ""Groovy Little Suzy"", to the mix. (If you love this song, check out the longer version on the ""Wild And Franticf Little Richard"" vinyl album on Modern records, from 1967).For longtime fans...this CD is of no use.One wonders why record labels do not seek out other presumptive ""Public Domain"" Little Richard cuts?"
5,A COMPLETE GUIDE 4TH. EDITION,EXCELLENT BOOK. THE VERY BEST FOR THE AMERICAN COLLECTOR. I NOW HAVE ALL (4) EDITIONS AND IT SURE HAS HELPED ME WITH MY COLLECTION. SIDNEY SELIGSON DID A FIND JOB AND I WANT TO COMMEND DARA FOR COMPLETING THE 4TH. EDITION. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL COLLECTORS.
3,"Well written, but thin","J. Cohen's writing is several cuts above the usual hack quality found in car books. Alas, he is awfully focused on Alpina, Hartge, etc., and skimps on info on the M models that are presumably the subject of the book! More detail on what, for instance, makes an E34 M5 different and special, or what are all the mods made to the E30 M3 that make it such a big deal, and how did it do in racing? None of this is addressed; rather, he spills a lot of ink on detailing every nuance of every Alpina product made in the last 30 years. If he wanted to write a history of Alpina, that's fine, but the cover, title, and description of the book leads one to believe that its principal focus is M and the products thereof.Nonetheless, the book is still several cuts above MBI's usually atrocious quality standards, and makes for an interesting evening of reading."
2,description,"Two volume set. Hardback,12 by 8-1/2, each one 256 pages.Publisher, The World Publishing Co.,,1945"
5,Amazing,The book came super fast and is in really good shape. The coolest cook book in a really long time
5,Found It!!!,"I remembered this book from when I was a first grader. I don't know what happened to my copy but I'm now a grown woman and I want a new copy! I don't even know how I remembered the name of the author, I had this book two decades ago! That's how good it is, folks! It is so creative in the way Dahl describes what the kids are cooking. The pencils? Brilliant! Wishing I would have gotten to make these things as a kid but my mom would have never let me. Going to try them now! Love, love, LOVE this book!"
5,Helps identify key points of a presentation on the screen.,Easy to adjust the size of the laser dot to draw attention to hightlight your point of the presentation.
1,"Good performance, dreadful quality","I got this on a whim used in a store, and while the performance seems good, the sound and picture quality are horrendous. This of a 2000 performance, but the quality seems like something from the 1950's. If you want to see a performance of this opera, be warned."
3,A Good Book,"Deep in the political season, this book makes for a good read. It is neither a complete history nor a complete pictorial of all the great campaigning photographs which abound. I was suprised by the iconic photographs not included. I wish I had leafed through this in the bookstore before buying. That said, it is a good book for any fan of political campaigns."
5,The essential Earl Klugh album!,"I must echo the other reviewers -- probably the best Earl Klugh album. One of his earlier albums (I was a heckuva lot younger when I bought it on vinyl!) but it's the one I never tire of listening to. ""Cry A Little While"" is the standout track for me. It's intricate, haunting, beautiful. The kind of melancholy music that makes you hurt, in a good way. Exquisite torture, especially if you're a guitar player, and you really wish you could play more like Earl. I have a number of Earl Klugh CD's, and frankly, some of his stuff borders on elevator music (sorry). Some of it is great, but as far as this album goes, don't miss it. It's Earl Klugh at his absolute best."
3,A knock off product,"I had once bought a similar product from the catalog Home Improvements that was better quality and had weights and not sand to weigh it down. The mesh is cheap quality as well. However, for the time until I can get the better product , it works to keep out bugs."
1,Not a good solution,"Not all the parts were in the box - it was missing two magnets in the middle. However, I put it up thinking that if it worked out, I'd just add a couple of magnets. It looked great when I first put it up. However, the magnets did not automatically close back on a regular basis. I found myself closing them all the time. Then, it got windy and the magnets were banging against the door when it was closed - not a great repetitive sound. To make things worse, as others have said, the sun melted the glue and it fell down. To sum things up: this screen was not a good solution for my deck door."
1,Waste of Money,"In my opinion, this product was a complete waste of money. The ""snaps or locks"" weren't magnetic, which is what I thought. They were velcro and did not stick to the doorframe or each other well. The mesh was horribly put together. It looked like an arts and craft project my daughter made at school. Very disappointed with it."
4,great screen product,"Worked like a charm. Hung the screen, cut a small hole in the bottom so my cats can get to out their play area without letting flying critters get in!"
3,It's alright....,"It was the perfect length and it was easy to install, but the glue on the velcro melted the first day it was up and it is not quite wide enough for the door. I think I am going to put more velcro on the sides and try a different glue for the velcro."
3,mesh screens,"they start coming apart too fast. screen starts seperating from itself.and velco doesn't stick together very good, if it's a windy day"
3,Made my own,"Because velcro cannot be trusted, I bought some fiberglass screen material, slit it up the center lengthwise and overlapped it. Then I sewed that onto a fabric ""tube"" so that I could slide it onto a spring rod to hang it. I also put a tube on each of the overlapped bottoms with a heavy rope inside for the weight. It's lasted for several years. It took a bit of time, but it works better than this product."
3,Mesh Screen,"Works as it is supposed to.Only problems are it snags easily, and weighted bottom sand shifts and has to be readjusted."
3,"Works well, but not in the sun","This product allowed me to open my door to get fresh air, without worrying about flies and mosquitoes coming in. It was easy to install and easy to get in and out of. And it is easy to remove as well. However, the sun dried up the glue holding the Velcro strips, and they fell off. I recommend using this product in a place where the sun is not beating down on it. Or else find a different way to keep the screen up in the sun."
2,Mediocre at best....,"Screen is okay as far as quality goes, unfortunately it's not wide enough to cover the whole door opening which means the bugs can still get in. Also the velcro adhesive is WORTHLESS, mine fell off within 2 days! I guess if you can nail it on it's okay but we can't since the frame is metal."
4,Quilt Classic,"482 illustrations of old patterns, black and white, of the nostalgic yesteryear, it is a delightful historical exercise in quilt making, old-fashioned work in the not-so-modern way. A person making her first quilt may have some difficulty, but it can be managed. Information on planning the quilt, calculating the number of blocks needed to fit a bed, pattern selection for a given room, and buying the materials are all here, explained in detail. This may not be the book for those who like only contemporary patterns. All in all, this is a classic!"
1,NOT the game I expected it to be.,"LEt's say this. I own the game JUSt4play which is also an interactive dvd game and I can't even compare this game to that game. Lucky lovers is pg13 game. There are no words like oral sex or even sex. (yea, they use lick and make love)Very very gay game. Lot of times they ask you to go to a kitchen and get some supplies like cream or something cold. Im sorry, but by the time this will happen your lover will completely lose interest in you. lolVery uninterested and boring. Lots of questions are a repeat, no levels, the whole games take like 10 min per game.If you really want to get excited and stay this way throughout Never buy this game. Get Just4Play instead or betterget BLISS games for couples which you can get online and pay like 30 dollars for it after a free trial."
4,Management of Data in Clinical Trials (Wiley Series in Proba,The authors gave an excellent overview af scientific skills used in the field of clinical research.
3,Not too bad,"Very warm and cozy. No problems withStatic. But, man they are made for anamazon(no pun intended) basketballsPlayer! The legs are so long, I have toHold them up when going up or downStairs so I don't trip. The feet are so bigIt's like Bozo the clown shoes. They shouldMake them separately in men and womensSizes so they get the leg length and footSize better. Was thinking of returning them,But the mfgr has a restocking and cleaningFee, so I kept them. BUT I WILL MOSTDEFINETLY SAY, when it's really reallyCold! I grab these and stay warm! They can'tBe beat for staying warm!"
2,This is not a How To book.,"I was not impressed with this book as it was not a developmental book. It did not provide the practice exercises that help you improve you abilities, which is what I was hoping for. If you like to read fiction novels this book would be a book for you, but if you want to learn to use you clairvoyant abilities....skip this novel."
2,clairvoyance,not what i expected. i thought it was going to give instructions about how one can become clairvoyance. its more like a history and what it is all about. May be others will like this kind of reading. so i am not condemning this book- just that it is not what i was expecting
4,Claivoyance,"This book was especially helpful in referring other texts that might be useful on the subject of clairvoyance. It's a bit elusive at times about how to develop a practice, but the writing style is mostly clear and enjoyable to read. The anecdotes told in this book also work well as a kind of measuring stick for one's own experiences."
3,pros and cons,"Clairvoyance by C.W. Leadbeater is, from my standpoint, a very hard to locate book. At around $28.00, this copy is also quite expensive. On Amazon there are several books that come up when searching for this one, usually with yellow covers, that only include about 18 pages, which is basically sold one chapter at a time. This version of the book is complete. however, for the price, I was expecting a higher quality of printing and packaging. The text on the pages isn't even typeset, or a ""fresh"" version - it is more like a xeroxed manuscript, with crooked letters, blurs, and toner spots. The binding and cover are flimsy at best. I guess what's really important are the words, and I mean, it IS the actual text of the book in its entirety, but if you have any taste for packaging or collectability, this will leave you disappointed. Looks aren't everything, but a $28.00 xerox in a bland cover is not what I expected."
1,Unsound Statistics,There are better-written and more mathematically sound papers available on the topics covered. Not recommended.
2,"Some good moments, but not enough","The great merit of Kiske was to avoid some metal cliches. But the result was so uneven that I did not like most of the album, even with Adrian Smith and Kai Hansen supplying great solos in some songs."
1,Horrifically Disturbing,"This movie is a twisting, turning adventure with an awful, shocking end. It left me feeling horrified and aghast. My recommendation is stay away! I feel as if this movie messed with my head and not in a good way. It has a message of letting go of hate, which is a beautiful message but I think it could have been portrayed in a more positive, less sickening manner!"
1,stay away from this convoluted and sick movie.,"this movie was such a disappointment. if this actually happened the twins this mother had would have genetic defects rivaled only by the Pharoahs of ancient Egypt. a sick and twisted, improbably tale of pure confusing nonsense. i'd give it a half-star but the rating system wont let me."
3,French Speakers Only!,This DVD DOES NOT HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLES! BUYER BEWARE! IF YOU'RE PERFECTLY LITERATE IN READING AND LISTENING TO FRENCH THEN YOU'LL BE IN FINE SHAPE TO VIEW THIS OUTSTANDING MOVIE.
5,Great Movie!!!!!!!!!!! Mad Im just viewing this for the first time,"Great movie! Up there with some of the best foreign films (Slum Dog, Ciy Of God, etc.) So glad i purchased."
4,Incendies,"More echoes of CITIZEN KANE: a daughter (later joined by her twin brother) travels to a Lebanon-like Middle Eastern country to crack her dead mother's Rosebud, which here takes the form of 2 letters to be delivered to a mystery father and brother. The puzzle's solution hinges on some ludicrous coincidences, but the surprise is emotional enough that it doesn't matter. The civil war flashbacks have a curiously intimate feel; the director wisely focuses on scenes of brutal aftermath rather than full-scale battles. The mix of anti-war polemic and family melodrama balances out nicely. 7/10"
3,Well Done And Some Serious Soap,"Well Done And Some Serious Soap. The twist, though over the top, exhibits well the monsters that war makes us."
2,Poor Transfer,"I bought this for The Rite of Spring, since as yet this is the only performance of that ballet on video. The storyline in this performance deviates from the original. Additionally, the transfer from the original is sloppy, and all rapid arm and leg movements dissolve into little squares. We'll have to wait for an adequate video of this famous ballet."
2,not a fan,not a fan of this product. They are hard to put on and it feels like my legs are being suffocated and my circulation cut off.
4,This Book is Great!,This book is one of my # 1 favourites but in some Places it quite sad.In the last book Lydie hurt herself and now I'm Glad she better.Gemma is definately a star.The books number 1 fan
3,Okay Read,"This book was okay could have been better. At times it even got on my nerves the way they kept mentioning how she's not the most beautiful woman he has ever met. The author made and irritating note to mention it several times. Another was how the people around him never ever defy him, whatever. I did enjoy the mystery that was the only thing that got this review 3 stars."
4,authenic alaska,"excellent rundown of what it is really like to be/to live in Alaska. Incisive writing with humor and insight. The land and the atmosphere of living in Alaska defy description, but in combining readings from different sources the McGinniss book should be included in one's library."
3,"An interesting read, but biased","This book was a fun read for me, since I am from Alaska. Indeed, many of his characterizations about the people here are accurate--this state is full of quirky characters looking to escape one thing or another in their lives! It was also interesting to read about the places he visited, since I have been lucky enough to visit many of them.However, I found his blatant bias against development and the oil industry disturbing. I found myself contstantly wanting to remind him that without those planes and automobiles, which require oil in one form or another, he never would have been able to visit all the places in Alaska he wrote about. The first oil was just going through the pipeline when he was here, yet he had already made up his mind that oil development was ""bad.""I hope Mr. McGinnis doesn't drive a car or heat his home with oil--ditto for all the other environmentalists that want to lock up Alaska."
1,"""Fiction"" at its WORST.","So McGinnis takes a few plane flights and is an expert on Alaska? What a joke. He also talks about a Moses Lake, Oregon! Moses Lake is in Washington, not Oregon. His poorly researched book and his foul language and racist attitude are OFFENSIVE. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Nasty language...waste of time.,"Save your money on this book and buy ""Looking for Alaska"" by Peter Jenkins instead. ""Going to Extremes"" was a total waste of my time. His non-stop foul language and embelished stories seems a front to sell books and cover up for the fact that he may not have even been there at all."
5,"Thank you, Joe!","I don't know anything about Alaska until I read this book. I have no idea whether it is accurate or not the way he described that remote area. But my heart was following him everywhere he went and every feeling he got. I chewed on every word, and was totally lost in the last episode when they found this beautiful meadow. I was speechless after I closed the book. I sat at the beach, and had it to myself again and again, that beautiful meadow, the peace, the harmony...Thank you, Joe!"
4,"Maybe the best of the whole ""Alaska Experience"" books","I really liked this book. McGinniss has a knack for inviting us along without being too ""reporterish"". Having spent quite a bit of time working in Alaska in the 1990's I came to recognise the odd, quirky, somewhat misfit type of individuals that populate this amazing place (The characters in the television program ""Northern Exposure"" weren't that exaggerated). McGinniss has captured this oddness without being judgmental. It's so matter-of-fact that the reader connects with McGinniss's experiences and ultimately finds the pull of Alaska, with it's unique population, almost irrestible. It is unavoidable that many readers will compare ""Going to Extremes"" with John McPhee's ""Coming into the Country"". While McPhee's book is good, he never seems to get the flavor of the whole ""Alaska"" the way that McGinniss does."
4,Good book on Alaskans,"I enjoyed this book. It doesn't tell you everything about Alaska, but it gives you a good feel for what Alaskans share in common. I have since traveled to Alaska and I think this book captured what I got out of our wonderful trip there. I remember meeting a lady in Wasila who told me how she was drawn to Alaska. She said that her brother from Anchorage sent her a picture showing the midnight sun. She arrived in Alaska in the winter and there was a blizzard and over 3 foot of snow. She said she just loved it and never went back to where she came from. Alaskans have a certain mindset that draws them there and it is rather unique and interesting. McGuiness is a good writer and does a good job of getting us to understand the Alaskan mentality."
2,Don't buy it!,"This is one awful CD! Contrary to its name, it's not serene at all! track one is an entire half hour of 'bubbly noises' and perpetual twangs of awful music! track two is a little better but not much. It features relaxing wind noises- and perpetual twangs of awful music!Generally,the 'enhanced with music' CD's aren't as good as the plain CD's. It's hard to imagine you're on top of a serene mountain,for example,when the guitar music is playing louder than the nature sounds!"
5,Fantastic for Relaxing,"I mislaid my original copy of this CD (which I bought around 2002 or 2003), so I was glad to finally replace it from this website. Fantastic quality and always creates an ambient mood no matter how agitated I'm feeling. It is (essentially) the sound of upland water and wind on the mountain top, but for me there isn't another relaxation CD that really matches it. It doesn't attempt to compose the sounds of nature, allowing them instead to speak for themselves. I was expecting to pay a higher price TBH, so I'm particularly pleased with this purchase."
3,Refund - non delivery,"I don't have much basis for a review. Apparently, the book was lost in the mail, and I was given a refund."
1,Ocean Blue color is PURPLE.,"I was making a costume for Halloween and drove far to get this stuff, as my local store was out of Rit. Waste of time. 2 packets added, and pure purple water. Turned everything purple. Not even a blueish purple, just plain purple. Back to the drawing board..."
5,Good war story,"A spy novel about a confederate widow who was very bitter because her husband was slain and felt guilty being a spy. Morris is a master at describing the girl's feelings. If you want a good historical civil war, this is it!"
1,GOOD DISC CLEANER,THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN ALCOHOL AND WATER.I HAVE TASTED IT AND COULD ADD IT TO MY COFFEE WITHOUT NOTICING.USED IT ON MY AFRICAN GREY IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCOURAGE FEATHER PLUCKING.IT DOES NOT SEEM TO PHASE HIM AT ALL.MAKES A GOOD SOLUTION FOR CLEANING DVDS HOWEVER.IF I AM MISSING SOMETHING HERE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO KNOW.MY NEIGHBOR OWNS A VERY LARGE PET STORE AND ALSO CONCURRED THAT IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE ON PARROTS.
3,"Good, but not good enough","Like all of Aubrey's stuff, this smells absolutly great! Unfortunatly, though, it doesn't really work for me. I've tried alot of other natural deodorants, and while this one hands DOWN smells the best, it doesn't really fight odor the best."
5,This deodorant rocks!!!!!!!!,"I just bought this yesterday at the local store and am so impressed. I smell great.. I have been looking and looking for something that would control odor and this one does it. I am moving away from all those parabans and god knows what else they use to natural products and I have to tell you that I am having a love affair with Aubrey organics, they are really creating some great produts.I hope they never stop making this deodorant among other things in their line."
3,Don't love the smell...,I just got this product in the mail and I'm not thrilled about the scent. I know the ingredients are all natural but it smells a bit like public bathroom disinfectant to me. I'm going to try to remedy this by adding some lavender essential oil to it but the smell of the product is pretty strong so I don't know if it will work. Still three stars because the product works fine in that it helps prevent and mask body odor.
2,Stinks badly and causes skin reaction (for me)...,"I was looking for an alternative to toxic deodorants, and decided to try Aubrey Organics -E Plus High C Roll On, per the suggestion of a sales clerk at a local natural supplement store. Made with (potentially) great ingredients like aloe leaf juice, grapefruit extract, lavender, and calamine and rose water, it sounded safe enough. What I didn't realize was how messy this would be, that it would smell awful and completely burn my skin (after shaving). It does work against bad BO (Body Odor), but, that is about all. I really wish I could give this a higher rating. It is just challenging to to find an effective deodorant made without aluminum, triclosan or other harsh ingredients.The search continues...."
1,Did not work at all,"This did not work at all for me. I might as well have been applying water to my armpits. Actually, that might have worked better. This stuff has a decent smell which is very mild. I wish it would have worked. If you're searching for a natural deodorant, Weleda spray deodorant and Queen Helene mint julep deodorant worked better for me. Another thing that works is applying Dr Bronner's liquid soap as a deodorant."
1,Doesn't really work and has an odd odor.,"I thought the scent of this was earthy and kind of nice...until I read the other reviewer that said it smells like bug spray. I hate to say it but they're right. It pretty much smells exactly like bug spray, which I guess isn't a noxious odor but it's not a fragrance one tends to seek out especially when you don't want to smell. It also didn't really work so by the end of the day I smelled like b.o. and bug spray. Really gross. I'm going to have to keep looking."
4,Not for me,"I tried this one because of the cute packaging, but I did not like this one much. The scent it a little harsh, and it's like liquid when you roll it on. If you like the scent, then it may work for you because the scent does last all day."
2,Wish it worked... but it doesn't,"I really wanted this to work, but unfortunately it didn't for me or my husband. We went back to using our Crystal Body Deodorant Roll-On, which is less expensive and works very well."
1,Ewww!,"Bought this for my husband, who is trying to stay away from all the chemicals in typical deodorants/antiperspirants.This may be all natural, but that's the unfortunate problem with this product along with others like it (ie Tom's of Maine).And doesn't do anything for wetness or odor. In fact, it stinks! Waste of money. Better to go without."
2,not strong enough,"I bought this hoping for good things. It worked great for three days and I thought I found THE product. However, by the fourth, I smelled something funky and realized it was me. I thought maybe I didn't put enough on or didn't shake it up enough, so I tried it for another few days. However, I just don't think this product works for me. I would say I smell like body odor masked with floral perfume. I think that it worked for the first few days I used it because I still had my old non-natural deodorant lingering on me."
5,Excellent natural deodorant,"This is the first natural deodorant I have ever purchased and I am very pleased with it. I am very happy that thanks to Aubrey Organics I could get rid of the toxic anti-perspirants/deodorants I had been previously using. My greatest concern was with the aluminum that most of these products contain (just read the label) as an anti-perspirant agent. The Aubrey deodorant is made from all-natural ingredients. It does not stop your skin from perspiring (which is one of the skin's natural processes), it only neutralizes the odor. The smell is very pleasant and gentle, but if you are used to the artificial aromas of most deodorants, you will definitely notice a difference. If you engage in heavy physical activity I recommend re-applying the deodorant every 3-4 hours.Overall, I am pleased with this product, and the peace of mind that I now have knowing I am no longer putting aluminum on my skin is wonderful."
2,doesn't work for me !,"I was looking to purchase a deodorant without all the toxic ingredents - that really works for my body.Aubrey's Organics hair conditioner work wonderfully. But this Deodorant didn't, it did not protect me at all. My daughter also tried it and didn't work for her neither... I'll keep searching........"
3,"It worked, but I still felt stinky just a little bc of aloe I guess","I like this product, but i got tired of having to re-apply it, and it drips. It is a great natural product though... The only thing is that depending on what I ate, I felt stinkier with this on, I think it may be the aloe that can smell a bit like onion which us gross. I now use the crystal rock, although I find myself having to find out how much water to rub on its top in order for it to work, and I also must reapply it.I now carry a little soap bar, wet and soap up a tissue, dry, and re-apply. It doesn't take much time if you're quick I guess, and I'm glad to have switched to natural products as much as I can both for myself, the workers who make these products, and for our environment.I guess, that depending on what you eat, and how much water you do or do not drink, you will be a bit stinky no matter what you put on- but it's not as bad as I think, I know (I hope : other's can't tell... ? ;)"
2,I'll keep looking,"I just received this product and have to say I'm disappointed. It smells like bug spray :( Definitely not what I had in mind. I was hoping it smelled like this chamomile/calendula diaper ointment I have that smells awesome. Unfortunately, the patchouli, calamine(like that pink crap you put on chicken pox), and the wood oils are winning this war. My husband told me I should wash it off. He was joking (kinda)we both agree the smell is not good. I normally don't wear deodorant because I don't have offensive body odor. I was just looking for something flowery to wear because natural perfume is really hard to find and outrageously expensive. Essential oil it is..."
2,smell is a big con,"It may be doing a good job with BO, but this stuff smells horrible. I don't understand all the good reviews. I threw out the bottle and took a shower immediately after first applying it. Trust me, go with something else."
2,Doesn't smell like pine to me,"I was disappointed with this deodorant. I live in Asia, and deodorant choices here are limited, so an herbal deodorant with pine scent sounded great. But it sure doesn't smell like pine to me. Even Pine-Sol bathroom cleaner has a more natural pine scent. This scent reminds me of some cheap deodorant some of the guys used to use in the locker room in high school. I can't believe how many people gave this product a high rating; I'll be more careful to read all of the negative reviews before I buy something from now on."
3,A bit too perfumey,"I bought it thinking it would smell somewhat manly, musky, tree smelling, lumberjack envisioning, but after my first day found myself constantly thinking, ""who's wearing the strong perfume,"" only to find I was sitting alone. At first spritz it has a bit more of a tree smell, but throughout the day smells more and more floral. In terms of staying dry, it did a much better job than Nature's Gate, which was useless, but not nearly as well as the synthetic stuff."
4,"Good, BUT..............","I just got this in Hong Kong. This is a very nice console compared to the other GameBoys. The best improvement is the backlighting.However, while everyone raves about the new rechargeable battery, I wish they had left the option of using normal batteries. When I go on vacation to the U.S. I will not be able to use my GameBoy (different currents and plugs). One of the pluses of handhelds is the ability to take them on trips and use them anywhere. So I feel that GameBoy has failed in planning for this.Does anyone know if the version sold in U.S. can be used in different countries?"
1,Don't bother!,"Actually, I really can't rate it because I never got the Nintento. After patiently waiting 5 weeks for it, I finally gave up and asked for a refund. The only good thing about it was Amazon gave me a refund within a week of me filing a complaint."
2,Best gameboy ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I asked my father to get me the sp for Christmas and he did! The sp is sooooooooooooooo cooool! It has a flip screen so your screen won't get messed up like my gameboy advanced ( Trust me. You don't want to see it's screen). And it has this cool light so you don't have to worry about your parents getting mad because you are playing in the dark. And it comes with this rechargeable batterry so you can play again and again. This gameboy is so cool. You have to get it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Greatest Invention Ever! By Maggie,"Ever since I played my friends Gameboy, I wanted one. I saved up money to buy it. Then for my birthday I unrapped a present and it was a Gameboy! I immideatly began playing it! It was soooo cool. The graphics are crystal clear. Perfesct size. Plus it's got really cool games you can buy. There are some games that you can't buy for Playststion, Xbox, or Gamecube. I love it. I definitly don't regret putting it on my birthday wish list!!!!!!"
3,Not bad.,"Pretty satisfied with this purchase. I wanted to buy this to relive some of my childhood years. Got a little bored with it after a while, but that was to be expected. Definitely a good purchase, though."
4,Not a terrible toy!,"This really cheered up my daughter. The DS is kind of the same to this I guess. Although, it does have a good design. So, I gave it 4 stars!"
2,Game Boy,"did not come with a charger and was not in ""good"" condition, more like fair condition.I had to buy a charger from e-bay and spent more than I wanted"
3,Gameboy SP,I got the SP and it was really dirty and covered with sticky crap everywhere on the screen that I'm still getting off. it works fine but I thought it would at least be semi clean and in nice condition....
5,Great for kids,We bought this for my son because he has a hard time focusing on anything for more then a minute and has a high stress level going into new places. So for his birthday we bought this. And it has been the best thing we have bought for him so far. It is with him everyday and night. Very sturdy and long battery life. The only thing I suggest is that it works with gameboy color games but the graphics don't match up to the Advance games so know that before you purchase games.
2,Another Bad Nintendo Making,"Yes, I do agree with the fact that this is better than the Game Boy Advance, but Nintendo has never been good when it comes to video games. The DS isn't much better than this because they all have flat graphics but what else can u expect? This was Ok, but when you have many games that you wasted money on for a piece of junk machine, you realize that this REALLY SUCKS!"
2,Bad Games................,It is great the only problem is that the games stink. The only games that were good were all the Mario games. I thing you should get this if you like Mario. My sister bought this 2 years ago and it is still in great shape. The other thing is that YOU SHOULD NOT GET A SONY PSP!!!!!!!!
1,NEVER RECEIVED ITEM / POOR COMMUNICATION,"Communication from seller was poor to non-existent. I never received the item (gameboy). The seller claimed the post office lost the item, but never supplied any tracking information whatsoever. When I emailed the seller to inquire about an equal replacement item, I did not get any reply."
2,Opening for head rest too large,"I often put a regular towel over my seat after running and thought this would be great. But, the opening for the headrest is huge, so it pulls forward and slides down the leather seat, leaving a large uncovered area below the head rest. If this had velcro at the top to close it with some adjustment, it would have been great.The weight of the towel is a little light which I guess is OK for this application.I still use it but it could have been better."
4,Wonderful!!!,"A truly wonderfully made film, mostly accurate to scripture and brilliantly acted. Joseph's brothers are the stars here in their own right but Paul Mecurio is in fine form as well."
5,Joseph,"Ah, my favorite Bible story. After watching this and seeing how well produced it was, I can only say that I watch it ast lease twice a month."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"I liked this movie, except one scene where Potipher's wife is seducing Joseph, and he has a hard time resisting at first, whereas, Biblically, I think he was stronger than that. I REALLY like the actor playing Potipher. Because of the scene mentioned, I am hesitant to allow my younger children to view it. But, other than that, it was done excellently."
3,"""One scene away from perfect""","Had it not been for the unnecessary(sexually charge scene of ""Joseph's bath time"" this movie would have remain a perfectly beautiful, classic family movie for christians.Why should we be forced to view something that is not needed for the plot to be engrossing and tolerate the overabundant abuse of moral ethics even in christian movie making? I believe we deserve better, and it would be more beneficial for the industry if we could trust them to leave the ""garbage"" out!There are still people like me that prefer clean entertaiment, and would have purchase several copies of this movie for gifts had it not been for this totally unnecessary scene."
4,Joseph,"I thought that this film was really good, i just wish they had made it sutible for children by cutting out a few things and putting some clothes on the egyptian women. I really liked the end, it was so good, best part in the entire movie and worth buying just for that. This movie made the story so real especialy when Joseph's brothers throught him in the pit, it makes you realize just how hard it was for him, that his own family would betray him. And to the person that said that Joseph's brothers didn't like him because he was a proud arrogant tattle tale that is so un-true. His brother's hated him because he obeyed their father and because Jacob loved Joseph more than them. Joseph was ALWAYS faithful and obeyed God. He was sold into Egypt not because he needed to be straightened out, but because God had a plan to save all the land from famine including Joseph's family."
4,"Great beginning, great ending","This four hour video looks a the familiar ""Joseph"" story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists. First, it just jumps into the Egyptian setting. Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say ""brava"" to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests. Finally, the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale. However, my ""four star"" rating refers to the ""flashback"" section of the film. Yes, why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it? It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the ""B"" grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden."
5,"Joseph, the Dreamer",This is an incredible telling of the story of Joseph and the roller coaster ride on which he rode. One of many Biblical Old Testament stories made by Turner Films and this is of very high quality. Not the wooden-like acting which is not uncommon in Biblical story telling in some past films. This is first-class and definitely worth 5 stars.
5,"Confusing at First, But Worth It","This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph, the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.Joseph is the favored son of his father, a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery, he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first, it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well."
5,joseph,"My God, i have never seen the story of Joseph in this light. I had no idea how commited, humble and faithful Joseph was in the bible. What watching this movie did for me is to reevalute my life and it caused me togo higher in intergrity at work, school and everywhere in my life and in addition, it made me realise how much everything i did was mediocre and how much i needed to live a life of excellence in everything that i did. It showed me that God is always faithful and that he is a rewarder of those who deligently seek him. Joseph suffered for like 13 years, but he spent the rest of his 70 something years in complete abundance in God. This movie has really been a blessing and i encourage everyone to get a copy of it. Believe me your life will never be the same."
4,Wonderful Story,"This was one of the best movie from a Old Testament Biblical story. The only problem with this is the nude scene when ""Joseph"" was nude in the water. I think this could have been left out and the story would had been perfect."
5,Bringing the Bible to life!!,"This is by far my most favorite of the ""Bible Collection"" movies. It is done very well, and yes there are a few scenes that get a little steamy, the movie should be reviewed by parents before deciding to let the kids view it without being ready to hit the fast forward button.As far as I can tell it is biblically accurate and really brings to life this great old story.You will see and understand this story in a whole new light after viewing this masterpiece.I have seen this film many many times and the ending still gets me wiping away the tears from my eyes.This is truly a great movie and you will not be disappointed!"
5,Joseph,Joseph is amazing story to read and watch. A person with the lord's help goes through trail. goes from a lowely shepard boy to the second highest person in Egypt.
1,Nakedness not necessary!,"The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary. Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie. I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene. This should be rated PG 13 at least."
1,"If you are looking for a Christian family movie, this isn't","I am very disapointed with how accepting we as Christians have become, after seeing nudity in a story that we should be able to trust, (in front of my wife and children as well), I turned it off. Even though I am sure this was part of the culture in this time,I know in my heart that the Lord would not want this publically viewed. The producer could have easily led the viewer to realize woman were being protrayed this way without showing anything. My family and I, were offended."
1,Joseph's story is inaccurate,This video was culturally inaccurate. It could have been great. The Elizabethian accents were ridculous as well as the pale egyptians. I was sorely disappointed in this films portrayal of Israels and the Egyptians....by the way I believe the Africans were darker than Leslie Ann Warren.
4,Nicely done depiction of the story of Joseph,"This telling of the story of Joseph in the TNT Bible Collection is very good. Although certain liberties were taken with the account as fleshed out in the Bible, these did not impact the overall telling of the story in keeping with what the Bible reveals. The use of Joseph telling of his early history with his brothers and how he came to be a slave in Egypt was done as a flashback, which actually enhanced the dramatic telling of the story. Very nicely done and mostly true to the Bible account."
5,Highly recommend this CD,"I have had the pleasure of meeting The Vogues when I lived in Palm Bay, Florida. I brought along my old LP and a couple 45's that they were happy to autograph. I am very pleased with this Cd, The Best of The Vogues"". If you liked their songs too, this CD is a must."
3,Just okay...,"It was an ok film, but was one of those films that show so much of what the film is about, and what happens... that by the time you see it in the theater, you feel as if you have already seen it. No surprises... Dull."
1,WEAK REMAKE OF A CLASSIC FILM,"This film is a cheap remake of the classic 1962 thriller. There are certain scenes they try to steal, "" My name is Eujineau""(sp?)in the train scene originally acted by Janet Leigh. Using the same phone # as in the original so they would have something in common with the good one. Manchurian Corporation replacing Manchurian China does not work. This film is chocked full of bad acting, a bad script, and a non-sensical plot. Skip this one. Not worth your time nor trouble."
2,Creative Bankruptcy,"Hollywood continues to grind out unnecessary remakes of classic films. The latest victim is the 1962 Cold War masterpiece, ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Director Jonathan Demme's 2004 rehash squanders an excellent cast (Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber and Meryl Streep) while moving at a snail's pace. What's next - a Technicolor version of ""Citizen Kane""?"
1,Should have been great -- isn't,"First, be aware that after paying $20 for this, Paramount expects you to sit thru 5 commercials before you can get at the movie. This situation is getting out of control. Its arrogance in the supreme that should not be tolerated.This should have been a great movie. The original was great and they had that example to follow. The thrill and suspense are built into the script. This movie is lousy. One of the producers/directors discusses how the blurred background behind the actors was to achieve a ""dream-like"" perspective to the scene. He was proud of that ""artistic license"" but projecting the point of the movie was less important. The movie ends with the business tycoons only disappointed, not punished. Are there more brainwashed people left? Are they thinking of a sequel? Yes, and they should forget it.One star for the actors. They did a great job in a difficult movie. Don't buy."
2,"Remake of ""Candidate"" undone","Despite a great cast headed by Denzil Washington,Meryl Streep & Jon Voight, this remake is extremely disappointing. Washington is excellent but changing the plot and making the chief character to be a politician drains the film of whatever suspense and tension the original did have. Demme is no John Frankenheimer, his direction is competent but plodding and I found myself waiting for this film to end rather than being tied up in knots as I did with the original. Washington may be a better actor than Sinatra yet the original contains proof that Frank was a fine film actor (also check out ""Man with the Golden Arm"" to verify this!)and he delivers. Rent the original and give this one a pass."
1,Great movie..really well done..Too bad the market place here has no oversight.BLURAY IS 178:1 NOT 235:1 AMAZON HAS THIS WRONG,BLURAY IS 178:1 NOT 235:1 AMAZON HAS THIS WRONGGreat movie..one of the few remakes that I feel really worked as was worth it.Unfortunately I purchased from the flea market place for a like new and got a case and cover art that looks like someone has played soccer with it in a dirty field.The case is scratch all over..the cover art is warped and stained with G-d knows what..I honestly am going to wipe the whole thing with alcohol..It's DISGUSTING.The market place is a gamble..I bat around 70%..the 30% is so far from the description that is it cannot be an oversight.It has to be intentional..Buy from the market place at your own risk..If you haven't got burned yet..YOU WILL
2,Lost opportunity,"What a shame. the new version needn't have tried to ""copy"" the original but why, oh, why did they strip the story of it's emotional impact. Raymond's hatred of his mother was watered down to nothing. Raymond's relationship with Jocelyn was mimized to the point where her demise was more of an afterthought. The current version lacked humor. Ben's patriotism was eliminated. the antagonist was sketchy and indistinct. the character of Raymond's stepfather was eliminated. The emotional core of the story is a tragedy with echoes of Hamlet from which Condon obviously lifted part of his premise. Demme seemed to end scenes 30 seconds to early, just when the characters were about to develop. None of the character's developed, particularly Raymond. Enough said. At least the new version has drawn peoiple to the old version, a true classic"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:As far as remakes of beloved films go this one isn't too bad, with good performances by Streep and Schrieber and a reasonably successful updating of the original's premise; however, the ending is such an uninteresting copout that the film as a whole is just barely not worth recommending."
5,Amazing!,I love this movie. It is suspenseful and kind of creepy to think that our government could do such a thing (as you will find out once you watch the movie). It kept my attention and I just wanted to know what would happen next. I really enjoyed it and felt that it should be a part of my small DVD collection.
4,I loved it.,"This was a great movie with an interesting plot. It was difficult for me to follow at times, but that may just be me. I really enjoyed this movie. It was powerful and it easily kept my attention. I strongly encourage you to rent it or at least watch it before you buy it, if you plan to. Although it can be perfect for some people but terrible for others, I think it would be an amazing film to add to your collection."
2,I bought the hype.....,"I definitely bought the hype of this movie and was let down. I am a big Denzel fan, so I just had to rent this movie. Well Denzel does his part, but the storyline/plot was a joke to me. It made sense but it just wasn't good enough for great actors like Denzel and Meryl Streep. Towards the middle it all starts to get long winded and boring. I know that this isn't an action movie but I thought it was supposed to be a suspense type thriller or something like that. There wasn't much suspense for me; I could see almost everything coming a mile away, especially the cheap and corny ending where I was hoping to be rewarded for sitting through all the speeches about whatever. Anyway, if you like Denzel and Meryl Streep, then you won't be dissapointed because they act very well as always. However, if you like a good plot and storyline and suspense, then look elsewhere."
3,Strange,"The plot was terribly convoluted and some of the characters were not developed well at all. This was not Denzel's best performance. Somehow, the story did keep me interested for most of the movie. I started getting bored towards the end. Overall, it's a pretty bizarre movie that was OK. Some scenes were unnecessarily violent too. I probably could have found better use of those 2 hours of my life I spent watching this movie."
2,Had Potential,"I was disappointed. Meryl Streep was the star of this one, she really didn't need the supporting actors. They could have done a lot with this movie which had my attention in the beginning, but once I figured out what was going on (35 minutes into it) it became boring and predictable. I agree with another reviewer, Denzel did what he could with what was given to him, his pitiful character was sad to watch. They could have done more with Kimberly Elyse as well.The movie wasn't horrible, it's just one that I won't watch again or recommmend."
2,Save Time,"Save yourself 2 hours of your time--watch the '62 version with Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey. Angela Lansbury is delicious as the manipulative mother!Every single character in this re-make is stiff, wooden and can't act their way out of a paper bag!"
1,Over-the-top boring drivel...,"Don't be fooled by the big name actors involved in this project. They must have needed money for rent.This movie claimed to be ""suspenseful"". It had about as much suspense as 4 back to back episodes of ""Meet the press"".Yawn. I had to keep checking the display to see how much time was left in this DVD, as I couldn't believe it hadn't picked up speed.The convoluted plot was so abstract that by the time it started making sense, who cares?Overrated by a mile, I felt ripped off just renting this bomb and wasting 2 hours of precious life on it.Don't we have enough corruption in real-life politics for any of this to truly be interesting?Kind of surprising from a director like this who has created worthwhile endeavors on more than one occasion."
3,What's with the trailers???,The worst thing about the DVD are the interminable trailers at the beginning that the disc doesn't allow you to skip through. Totally maddening that you have to sit through this drivel before you are allowed to get to the actual movie you paid for. This must be stopped.
1,Reputation as worst movie ever well-deserved,One of simply the worst movies of its generation-- a total disaster from beginning to end. All-star cast does not save this mess.
1,meh.,"Another Hollywood remake far inferior to the original. Meryl Streep was lustrous. If you like small, but very cool actors' performances, this is excellent for her performance and, to some extent, Liev Schreiber's. Denzel is Denzel ... yet again. A star, yes; a good actor? maybe."
3,Not bad remake with a partial good Washington.........,"Denzel Washington (Training Day, Man On Fire) gets a case of paranoia in this updated remake of the 1960's classic, the one with Blue Eyes in it. Anyway, so Washington was saved in Gulf War supposedly he thinks by candidate Liev Schreiber (Scream Trilogy, Kate & Leopold) who is running for vice president. Schreiber's mother is played by Meryl Streep (upcoming Prime with Uma Thurman, The Hours) who gives a good performance here as she fools everyone around her, giving speeches and so on. So, Washington becomes really paranoid, asking questions, figuring things out and making sense of it if it's real or not. Not bad remake delivers some weird things with a partially good Denzel Washington....towards the end he wears off. Schreiber is real good in this as well. Also starring Jon Voight (National Treasure, Midnight Cowboy) and Kimberly Elise (John Q., Set It Off)."
3,The Oedipal Candidate....,"...the creepy Shaw son here reminded me of Anthony Perkins' performance of Norman Bates and while I generally dig Meryl Streeps' scene chewing, her acting here only whets your appetite for classic Streep overreaching like in Postcards from the Edge or more recently Angels in America...I mean to say, the director and editor don't allow the viewer to revel in Senator Shaw's maliciousness--hence Streep's fine acting--for too long before the story is quickedited along. Denzel does a good job as the soldier whose memory of a certain event during the Gulf War haunts him in unforgettable dreams. I was not pleased at how the thriller came to a close. My problem is that the last 10 minutes lets down the suspense and tension cleverly built up in the earlier three-quarters of this version the film. But if you've seen the original, you will appreciate this remake and you will appreciate casting Streep as the power starved Mother (although her scenes seem too short)...."
4,Another Denzel Hit,"Seems like Denzel Washington just can't miss, even with a remake. Just as exciting as the original with Gregory Peck and the mechanics of the brainwashing are done in a more believable fashion."
3,complicated,"Like the original, complicated requiring close attention to follow. Some slow parts, boffo ending worth the effort. Not for casual viewing."
2,Not impressed,"This movie is about a mega-corporation with special talents in mind control and manipulation of memories, that decides to apply those talents to gain control of the White House. Their target is the photogenic son turned war hero of a prominent US Senator who fits the role of the perfect political candidate. By implanting mechanical devices in his brain, Manchurian Global is able to take control of the young man for whatever purpose they need.The premise is intriguing, and I can see where it would be very appealing to some, especially the ""black helicopter"" crowd. But I think more could have been done with this. Compared to the original, it falls way short. Denzell Washington was brilliant as always, although this was not his best performance, and Meryl Streep was easy to despise in light of today's current political environment.I was interested enough to watch the entire movie, but wouldn't watch it again. And if you haven't seen either one, I would recommend the original."
4,A psychological thriller!,"Excellent performances by Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, and Liev Schreiber.Mind control is the order of the day and these orders have Denzel and Liev in their clutches.Powerful men and Meryl Streep, a Hillary Clinton look-a-like in the film, want the presidency by any means necessary. If they have to commit murder to secure the highest office in the land--so be it.But Washington is waking up; he's beginning to realize that something's wrong. What is it?Of course no one believes Washington's incredible tales of mind control. So it's up to him to save the civilized world from political anarchist.Can he get the authorities to listen to him in time?Watch this film and find out!"
2,Not all that interesting,"I never saw the original movie so I have nothing to compare this one to, but taken on its own merits, it isn't a thrill ride like the box promised when I rented it. In fact, it's rather dull and monotonous. Too many times you knew what was going to happen next thus taking away any suspense. I found the idea to be kind of a dopy one to begin with but it could have been pulled off and wasn't. To me, a good cast was wasted on this one."
1,Pathetic,Denzel Washington deserves the Pullet Surprise for his half-baked performance in this piece of road kill.Now Frank Sinatra in the original version: There was a man who could play a dufus whole-heartedly. Go for that instead.
3,Good try - but the original is the best,"The Manchurian Candidate gets a facelift and the anti-communism is transformed into anti-terrorism and Desert Storm.Good earnest stuff from Johnathan Demme, but it just does not cut it when placed against the original version. There is too more gore and too many silly story lines for the whole thing to work.On its own terms, the film works as a solid thriller, but the director is Johnathan Demme who is in the top class of thriller directors. We deserved better.Meryl Streep, as Senator Mother, gives it everything and she may have carried the film, but it simply has too much baggage of its predecessor and no about of clever reworking or updating can shake it loose.At the end of the day it is not a patch on the original."
3,"Very exciting, with some twists.","Of course, I don't usually watch these types of action movies, but I knew that anything Ms. Streep is in must be quality, and I was right. Yes, I did like this movie, although, I remember reading the novel, years ago, and they really changed the story around in this version. Everyone has to keep up with the times, I suppose. The most entertaining things are the plot twists at the end, where you don't really know what's going to happen next -- and Mr. Washington does keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie is definately for the younger crowd. I will reserve anymore judgement to them. I'm sure they will enjoy it more than I."
4,Not great but good,"This Manchurian Candidate if compared to the original is average. However it might not be fair to compare the two even though they share the same title; the original is a classic among classics and even though the stories follow the same outline they deal seperately with the issues of their times. Even so, the new version has good entertainment value and a great deal of suspense. The acting performances are very good from the entire cast particularly Streep as the evil scheming biotch and the movie is also shot well. The director does a good job in several scenes of zooming in on the actors' faces which really captures the state of the character or situation in a subtle way and adds to the feel of the movie. Big fans of the original may be disappointed in the new version yet others (kids) might find the new version more appealing cuz of the more modern storyline. Overall pretty good."
2,Angela Lansbury...game over,"I never quite understood what exactly was happening in this film. It followed the original movie's story closely, but the changes made seemed focus-group inspired. Manchurian Global wants their own man in the White House? Well Haliburton's got their own man in the White House and no one had to put a microchip in Dick Cheney's head! The premise falls short of reality. The original mixed a sence of paranoia with black humor very well. It was told in black and white in more ways than one. This remake is far to murky and vague to generate any real sence of danger or dread.And finally, Meryl Streep is a fine actress, but Angela Lansbury's performance in the original is legendary. Streep doesn't even come close in comparison. Lansbury is one of the greatest movie villains ever. Her ""exit"" from the film is one of the most powerful screen images ever."
1,"Steering is the deal breaker, don't waste your money","It seemed like such a good idea at the time. We already had the bike trailer, instead of buying a jogging stroller, just get the kit to convert our bike trailer. Bad idea!This thing drives me crazy because it doesn't steer, it's a rigid 3rd wheel. It works fine if all you do is run straight, but who does that? Even a seemingly straight route usually has subtle turns. There are only 2 ways to steer: drag the front wheel, or push down on the handle to lift the front wheel up and pivot on the back 2 wheels. Sorry, but I really don't like having to expel half my workout energy every few feet to lift up the stroller.They need to put a pivot hinge of some sort on this. Without it, it's pretty much worthless to a jogger. Oh, and the brake is a joke. It would have been more usable to retrofit a brake to the back wheels, not the front."
1,Defective product.,"After a period of use and turned off, the unit will turn on with Blue LED but the screen will be blank and unusable. The unit will only be functional after being disconnected from the power source and cooled off for at least 30 minutes. Have asked return it to the DVS company."
4,great nav system,excellent product fast and very accurate very easy to use and with the huge screen you dont have to squint to see whats on the screen
2,Bolan clone,"It's pleasant enough to listen to but is a T-Rex/Marc Bolan rip-off. I have a hard time listening to any band that claims someone elses ideas and feelings as their own. Why not just listen to some early t-rex? It's alot better, it's original, and it isn't simply someone stealing another persons ideas and style. Anyway most of the songs sound kind of the same. If these guys ever do do anything original they actually might be worth a listen."
1,WARNING! Not a Good Experience.,"I purchased 5 thermocouples listed as ""Honeywell #cq100a-1021 18"" Thermocouple"" and received 3 24"" and 3 30"" ALL of which had been previously opened, damaged, were missing parts, and poorly taped up. A couple even showed signs of use.....maybe the broken thermocouple returned to the store after a new one installed??? Either way I order 5 18"" and didn't receive a SINGLE 18"" and since the listing said NOTHING about used, damaged, opened, or parts missing products I rightfully assumed I was buying new product.The good news is they promptly refunded my money without any problems. Obviously they had had this problem before and were not surprised by my complaint. They did comment that they thought that is what I wanted..........NO, if I wanted 24"" or 30"" thermocouples that is what I would have ordered!! Overall a complete waste of my time and energy dealing with an incompetent and/or unethical seller. One star because ZERO is not an option."
5,As advertised!,"It is a thermocouple! And you will appreciate having this on hand at 9:30 pm on a Friday night when it is -20 out. I didn't have one when that happened, had to wait until HD opened Saturday morning. Now I have two of these sitting next to the furnace."
5,"Honeywell #CQ100A-1021 18"" Thermocouple",Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.Product as described...
3,Problems with shipping,"Like another reviewer, my order arrived with dented, leaking bottles. I think they need to be individually bubble wrapped for safe transport. Excellent product otherwise."
3,"Great product, but beware of shipping it!","We love this product - have purchased it at the local co-op many times. When I saw it on Amazon for a great price, I jumped to order it! I'm not sure I'd order it from Amazon again, though - the box arrived drenched in leaking laundry detergent. All four bottles had opened and leaked during shipping, causing a huge mess. Another review reported a similar problem, and I chose to ignore it - but the review was right, the single corrugated box just doesn't hold up for shipping a product like this."
1,problem container--cracks and leaks!,"the product itself, is fine. the container is unexceptable.. it is so fragile it will crack if not placed on a completely flat surface and handled like glass. we had two of our four bottles crack on the bottom in less than a month from purchase. all the contents leaked out made a terrible mess in our storage room. what a waste! we need eco friendly products for our grey water system and we live in a very remote place and buy in quantity. we can not afford to order this product again if it is not storable and is so poorly packaged."
5,I don't know how I lived without it,"This detergent has never failed to get out a stain and it smells amazing! It has a very light lavendar scent that is unobtrusive but will leave you wondering, what smells so good? I also love it because it is environmentally friendly and, when purchased through amazon.com, comparably priced to traditional detergents."
5,"Clean, fresh and relaxing","This detergent is gentle on the environment, but tough on stains. I've been pleasantly surprised and impressed with its cleaning power and how the it leaves the relaxing scent of lavendar on my clothes. I see no reason to ever buy another detergent other than Seventh Generation. My detergent arrived unopened. None were leaking. It was very convenient to have it delivered right to my doorstep."
3,Got What I Ordered,"The internal components in my last one obeyed entropy and fell apart, so I ordered this one. It eventually broke in the same way, but honestly it didn't do anything it said it wouldn't"
4,Crate Footswitch,"I purchaced a Crate 120/212 amp, the clean channel was flakey, when switching to the other channels using the switch on the amp, it would not switch back to the clean channel. I purchased this switch, and it fixed the issue, i now use the foot switch instead of the amp switch.It works perfect, A+."
3,Works better than the amp it is mated with!,"Brand new in the box, this footswitch was mated to my Crate Acoustic amp. It worked great right up to the point that the DSP effects board died so now it is completely useless.Not the fault of the footswitch, just lousy crate amplification strikes again! (This is the second DSP board in that amp in 3 weeks, I give up)."
5,Hooked at the get-go,This was by far the best fiction book I'd read for a long time. I was hooked from the very beginning. Don't get this book without the other three; you won't want to wait!
4,Great for keeping things put,"As with the entire quick grip products the features that should entice you to buy and use the Quick-Grip 5906ADV 6"" Advantage Power Clamp are the ease of adjustment and the fact that it won't mar even the softest of wood yet still provide ample force for your project. The screw adjustments make it easier to make fine adjustments on the pressure. People with low hand strength or hand pain can use the trigger ratchet used for the adjustment with ease. It only requires a firm squeeze just over the pressure used for scissors."
3,"Not earth shattering, but an easy, peaceful read","It drove me crazy that the author kept talking to me (dear one, my fellow sister, etc) but it's just a style thing, I guess. She makes lots of assumptions and as I am not of her faith (obviously by my disagreement with some of the things she says about a man's role to his wife), I would have preferred more background or references for her assumptions- especially those that deal with the culture of the time.Good, easy read, but like the title- not earth shattering or life changing for me."
5,Inspirational guide to living as a women of God,"Elizabeth George inspires me as a women, helping me to understand God's intention for my life to live for Him. I found this book to be a great guideline for my future walk in Him."
1,Don't judge a book by it's rating,"After reading all the glowing reviews of this book I was compelled to not only purchase it for myself, but 10 other copies for the women in my book club. It was a unanimous decision that we were all sorely disappointed. The first quarter or so was very promising and held our interest, but about halfway through we began to wonder if this woman ever slept or spent time with her family. Not only were we discouraged and left feeling inadequate, but after 20-something chapters I didn't feel like I really wanted to be a Proverbs 31 woman at all. Since reading this book I've gone on to read Captivating by John and Staci Eldredge -- now that is a book that truly makes you feel beautiful in God's eyes. If that is what you are looking for, as I was when I read Elizabeth George's title, then I recommend you find a different book."
4,"GREAT JOB, ANNE MAZER!","This book was good, but not the best in the series. This one is about how, sadly, Jessica goes to Oregon to visit her father and Abby finds out that she is now a new person. Plus, she has agreed to help Jessica by doing one of her jobs for her while she is gone. But things go wrong when Abby forgets about it one day. AND, it seems like Abby is losing her friends, but Casey and Mason always seem to be her friends. Will Abby be reunited with the REAl Jessica? What will happen with her job? Will she end up being best friends with ""Hoffman"" and ""The Mason Man""? Find out soon, get yourself a copy of this great book!"
4,# 9 review,"This book is a great abby hayes book, It is all about when jessica is out of town for 3 months!!! Abby is then in charge of doing Jssicas babysitting job. Nothing is going right for abby. Want to read more?? Get this book!"
5,great book,A great book for understanding what's happening on the web--essentially a must-read for anyone publishing there to any significant extent.
3,Sent wrong brand,"When I was looking to order henna I specifically wanted to order this brand because I had previous experience using it and it had worked well for me. When I recieved the product however, it was not Shweta brand, but Shelley. I intentionally did not order that brand because I was not familiar with it. Granted, I did recieve a tube of henna, but it wasn't exactly what I wanted. I also feel that it was a bit chunky and didn't stain exceptionally dark."
3,will do in a pinch,I have recently gotten into Henna application after many years as a temporary body artist. I was still learning the finer points of mixing my own henna so I thought I might use this until I got the hang of it. I was pleased with the consistency but I put it into my own bottles with proper tips. The tips that came with this product were fairly useless.However...It flaked off quickly even after proper drying and curing. And the stain was not terribly dark nor did it darken over time. ( I was at a conference and could see the developing color) This could have been due to other skin product applications that the ladies did not fess up to. However...I think it was the product.
2,kinda on the light side,"this stuff is pretty cool, but it dries a lot lighter than i was wanting. it turns kind of a medium shade of yellowish orange. i was hoping for a red or brown."
3,tattos,really thick.was kinda hard to squeeze out but did the job. not to dark.ok for starters. trying a different product
1,Worst Henna Ever,Wow...will never purchase this again! The tips were horrible and the paste was even worse. Will go back to mixing my own!
2,Ehhh,"Well I bought this item and I was super excited. I went ahead and sprused it up with there mehndi oil, lemon juice, and some sugar. I did a small henna design on my foot, put a sealer, and wrapped it in tissue paper and plastic wrap like the website said. It remained on my foot for a solid 9 hours. Much to my dissapointment when I removed it, the stain was no where near the color it typically is. I waited for three days so it could darken and it didnt get much darker. I suspect they either sent me a bad blend or an older tube."
2,Beachcombers Pre-mix henna,It was ok. Not very dark. Probably because the date-code on the tube showed this product was on the shelf for over 1 year before sale.
5,Great variety of tunes -- wonderful artist,"This is a great collection of musicfor German speaking customers --and Astrid Harzbecker does an amazinglypleasant job of interpreting the various different temposand moods.I only wish more of her work, and that of other Germanperformers, would be available for me to purchase!!"
5,The Coolest Kids Shoe...Way Unique,"Wow...what a great design and perfect young mans shoe. My son is styling in these sweet Adidas shoes that have a ""samba"" feel/look but don't scream soccer. Only complaint is the tongue is a little stiff and had to manually break it in to minimize wear with the ""no show"" socks the kids like to wear. Little pricey compared to some of the other Adidas on Amazon's site but they are very unique."
5,BEAUTIFUL SNEAKERS,"THIS SNEAKERS ARE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU CAN SEE THEM UP CLOSE, AND I RECCOMEND THEM IN EVERY COLOR, MY KID LOOKS AWESOME IN THEM"
4,Slick Shoes!,These shoes are the slickest and coolest shoes ive ever worn theyre so comfortable i can practically sleep in them i recommend them to everybody
5,All hail the king of pancakes!,"This is a really entertaining book - a must read for anyone who loves music, cinema, and the aging dowager empress that is Hollywood. This book is written by a gay man, one who talks a whole lot about his partner, but to label it as solely a gay culture or gay interest title would be completely wrong. Dave White's unique writing style, best described as wry and grumpy, is all over this book. In particular, Dave is deft at poking at the right ripe targets and dishing out the right amount of snark (to those who deserve it) without being one of the overbearing, that-was-so-five-minutes-ago types. Underneath the grumpiness and punk rock attitude lies some really great commentary."
1,Aniston Obsessed,"Any ""human"" who has had the misfortune of reading, well, ANYTHING, this(self proclaimed)has written, has knowingly, or by misstep, landed in the gutter. The lazy eye intellect couldn't even over look or find his constant reference to Aniston any less than drag queen, Cher obsessed obvious. He is a film critic? Nay. He's just a biased critic of anything/anyone he doesn't like (or doesn't like him). Not what review readers deserve. WHO WOULD ACTUALLY READ THIS BOOK? That's a sad thought.But at least that would be a voluntary trip to the gutter, unlike his so-called movie reviews."
4,Outstanding piece of Spray Equipment,"This Fuji Unit is outstanding - I have used this on my recent project of plantation shutters and the project came out beautifully on all 28 shutters. I used white latex paint, thinned with water and used floetrol and the project came out much better than I had hoped. You won't be sorry if you buy this."
3,THE Q4 BITES THE DUST,"I bought the Q4 after looking into several brands. I used the sprayer for about 3 hours total and then the turbine blew up. Consequently, I'm not impressed with the quality of the equipment. Now let's see how the manufacture stands behind his product. I'll up date you in the future."
5,Kuessen vorbeten,I loved this song so much I heard it in german class I almost know all the words to this song kuessen vorbten. I even have faru brenkmen play the cd during spanish culb they all love it.
5,Grrrreat!!!,"Although this is my least favorite of die PRINZEN's six albums (soon they'll have seven!!!), I really like some of the songs. Someone who made it here before me, said it was corny. I disagree with that, it's just funny, that's all. Some of the songs might sound wacko, but I'm sure they all have some kind of a meaning! For example Suleimann sounds like a funny song about an Indian tribe, but I think it refers to consumerism that flooded East Germany after the Wall came down. GREAT singing. If you think the Backstreet Boys are good singers, you're not even close. You'll see when you hear THIS!!! The best song on the album, to my opinion, is Bombe, which is anti-Nazi. Check out all the other PRINZEN CD's too, they're even better than this!!!"
5,Nice read and great printing,The Cape Light series is good. I like the fact that this book is bigger in size in paperback and the text is large and easy to read. I will be buying more published by Berkley.
4,Be careful buying the first 3 paperbacks,"I like these books all right, for what they are. Very similar to Jan Karon's Mitford series.But I bought the first 3 paperbacks together per Amazon's suggestion and did not notice that #3 is a larger size paperback. I was going to give them to a friend in a cute basket for a gift and they will look funny. Doesn't really matter, I guess, just be warned.I did find #3 here eventually, but when it arrived it looked used. Not sure what I did wrong! Oh well, it's good enough!Really enjoyed #3 myself. I think the characters are developing nicely and they sure aren't ""perfect"". Lots of typical human problems - makes for interesting reading."
1,books,this was my 1st time to order anything from amazonit will be my last . I order 3 books and on 9-10-11and was to recieve them on or before 10-5-11. I only recieveone book but not the others. amazon has not made any attempto to order these for me. I have had to have them refund my card.and I was really looking forward to these books to read.
4,The Tymes make this album,"Some people don't like re-recordings (and CDs that contain them should always say it somewhere not lo let us find out after we bought it), a few like me do because of the clarity and quality that sometimes can not be achieved with the original cuts, most of the songs here are new recordings but I simply love The Tymes hit 'So Much In Love"" this tune makes the admission price worth the money. If you simply hate re-recordings stay away from it but if you are like me and already own most of the original versions give it a try, for the price you can't go wrong even if you only like a couple of the songs."
1,Not very factual....,"I don't know, when you read this book, everything seems very far-fetched or thin. A shooter from in front? At the exact same time as Oswald? Two shooters? If Oswald was set-up to kill JFK, why did they need another shooter? He might miss? If so, why use Oswald at all?Where are the second shooter's bullets? Never found. So, they were hidden immediately AFTER the shooting? Where? In Jackie's purse? In the ash-tray?You see what I am saying? I'll give Mr. Lane credit for asking the right questions, but his answers really strain the evidence.Sometimes I feel like I was the only one NOT included in the conspiracy, probably because I was three years old at the time."
4,Fascinating variety of mosaic styles,"This book was written by a mosaic artist and teacher who's travelled extensively and kept her eyes open (and her camera ready)while sightseeing. The breadth of her scope is very satisfying (ranging from the ancient Greek and Roman to the very, very modern, with every significant school represented). She absolutely knows the medium, and gives sound and practiced techniques for creating various types of mosaics. She also includes photographs of all kinds of different work, so the reader can be inspired by a style that speaks to him or her. My only reservation about this book comes from the fact that my taste and hers differ, so there are other books available which (in my opinion)offer a more pleasing selection of mosaics to be inspired by."
1,Good if you are an Idiot,Actually on both videos these women are too good. They mean well and I received as a gift. HOwever when I listened to the voice talking Sloooowwly and enunciating like I was an idiot I figured it was not for me. Also get someone with a nice voice this lady sounds like nails across the blackboard. Yuk? Donated quickly.
2,Ruff Ridder,"I bought these thinking that My truck would ride smoother and get rid of the bounce and pogo effect (2000 Dodge 1 ton Dually). After I installed them I called KYB and ask if they would soften up a bit. They stated that the MonoMax shocks are 40% stiffer than Stock! Enough said. Theses are a BIT harsh for me. If I was hauling 1500# all the time as a True Work Truck then they would work out fine, Not to great without a Heavy load in the bed."
1,Very Few Originals,"This set looks like a great bargain but beware...most of the songs are not the original versions that you know and love. If you just want the songs in any form, go ahead but if you must have the original recordings, look elsewhere."
2,Most songs are not the original recordings,"I somehow assumed that these would all be the original recordings, since Amazon offers no information to the contrary. When I received the 3-disc set, I noticed fine print explaining that most of the 36 cuts were ""new stereo recordings""--which, even if they got the original artists to perform them, are just not going to be the same. Only 13 of the songs are listed as the real thing: The Birds and the Bees, Mister Livingston, Mule Skinner Blues, Stiki De Boom Boom, Ya Ya, The Oogum Boogum Song, Mr. Custer, Georgie Porgie, Nee Nee Na Na Nu Nu, Yummy Yummy Yummy, Baby Talk, Dede Dinah, and Alley Oop. If that's worth $9.97 to you, then you'll have no complaints."
2,SOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE IMITATION TO ME,"Nice CD and sounds great. However, I just can't believe that the songs are original, at least it don't sound that way, or in other words. Sounds Very Much Like Imitation To Me!!!"
5,What a fun story,"Countess Madeline Cavendish is on her way to live with her Uncle and marry the man she thought she loved. During her vogage to New Orleans she meets a handsome stranger who makes her blood boil. The ship she is on gets hit by a raging hurricane and knowing she only has hours to live she spends them in the arms of the handsome and seductive stranger. She is rescued but the stranger is not.... Going to her new home to see her Uncle and Fiance she trys to forget the blissful hours she kept with the stranger. As fate has it, he too was rescued and wants to continue where he left off........"
1,Not my favorite!,"After reading the other reviews and finishing ""The Scandalous Miss Howard"" I decided to try this one out. Well, Nan Ryan's writing style was too bland and ridged for my taste and I was unable to read past the first half of the book. I recommend any of her other books instead."
1,Whatever this product claims to do--it doesn't.,"I tried a bottle of this, thinking, Yeah, an end to midnight snacking!Nope. It doesn't seem to have any effect at all. At least it doesn't *increase* appetite!"
1,william shatner in spoon river?,"As an English teacher, I am thrilled when we finish a book and my students are still begging for more about it. This was my anticlimactic ""more."" Not only was it outdated and boring, it took half the film to get to Spoon River with no real explanation as to why. The choices there were antiseptic and cold leaving my students believing they were somehow odd to have loved the book."
1,disappointed,"As a lover of Master's Spoon River Anthology, I was dismayed when I first viewed this video. Although it's dated 1997, the participants appear in leisure suits and other late 70's - early 80's clothing and hairstyles, which was distracting for students, who, like their teacher, would have appreciated a more technically sophisticated and contemporary approach. The poetry is great and it is delivered expressively. However, I'd suggest just listening to the audio portion unless you feel like being amused!"
1,Master Poets Collection: Spoon River Anthology,"I purchased this video as a resource for students to use as they prepared for an upcoming presentation of the play version of ""Spoon River Anthology"". I found some of the presentational styles to be helpful to my students, but overall, the video was slow paced and did not hold the attention of H.S. students. It includes such a limited number of selections that it doesn't really offer a great deal of insight."
4,"Good finish, but were is the start...","This book was origanaliy writind in three parts, 1-General 2-Organic 3-Biochem and is available in parts or the whole. This book is the last 2/3 of the original. If you just took general chemistry the previous semester it will do fine, if not pay the extra few bucks to have the referance handy. Right off the bat the book asumes you memorized everything from general chemistry and gives no review or refresh at all.Over all good stuff. Bottom line i recommend the full editionIntroduction to General, Organic and Biochemistry (with CD-ROM and CengageNOW Printed Access Card)"
1,Wanted something to use for little visitors,"I have great nieces and nephews, who visit and I wanted something inexpensive to use for them to eat, instead of somebody holding her/him. I purchased this Booster Seat about 3 months ago, and had a chance to use it today.The seat is sturdy and the harness straps hold the booster securely to chair, but it is not worth the aggravation of dealing with this tray. I couldn't get it on, so had my husband try. He finally got it on, but we had to get it off. After we finally got it off, we looked at each other and said,""We weren't doing that again!""In a year it will serve as a booster, but they really could have come up with a better design that this!"
2,Difficult tray,I bought this seat as an extra to have for travel. The tray is almost impossible to snap into place. I plan to return it and get the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster. I'm sure it's worth the extra $5.
1,Get the grow w/ me Portable booster instead,this is a terrible seat. The tray is very hard to put on and if you happen to get a finger while trying it would be very bad. I was always worried about that until I put the tray on and my son started screaming... I had pinched his skin on his tummy and cut him pretty bad. I felt terrible. I called the company and told them - they are replacing my seat w/ the grow w/ me (i have had that in the past and its a great seat). Their service was good - so I was happy w/ that... but they should just stop making this seat.
2,Get the Fisher Price instead,"Yes, it's easy to clean. Yes, it takes up much less space than a high chair. Yes, it folds and is portable. But, the tray is almost impossible to get on or off because the tabs that hold the tray onto the chair fit so tightly and are so large and rigid. This is a design flaw, plain and simple. The Fisher Price tray has a totally different design that allows for easy on-and-off but holds the tray in place just as well, if not better."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"Not only is the tray nearly impossible to get on and off, but it's a safety issue, as well. My nine month old began to choke and I needed to get her out of the chair quickly - and couldn't. Luckily, she was okay, but I'm afraid to use the chair anymore. Also, if your child has even slightly chunky thighs or a thick waist this won't work for you. The tray sits really low on their legs and pinches and I can't even get the seatbelt to buckle around her waist (it's not long enough). My daughter is only in the 75th percentile for her age - so she's not that big."
5,"Maybe This Time -- There's no ""maybe"" about this winner!","For lovers of time-travel romance, you're in for a thrill of a read. MAYBE THIS TIME is the most extraordinary book I've read for years. Prepare yourself for an emotional journey that will touch the deepest recesses of your heart and soul with universal themes that transcend time and place and stretch the boundaries of the genre. For all those who have loved and hurt and searched for healing, this book will bring soothing joy and spiritual renewal that will give you the courage to love again and again and again"
4,my text book in fidm,"this is the book for 'textile science' and we still use it as reference in 'fabric id'. i have never read another textile book. so no comparison. since FIDM have been using this book for a while, i guess this can't be bad"
1,broken binder,"I didn't have a chance to open this till a month and half later due to a busy schedule and when I opened it, I realized the binder is broken. I don't have time to now return this item and re-order it. If you are shopping something to someone, make sure its not broken."
3,"Not bad, but too much rice and not enough tea.","Cheap, but there is almost all brown rice and very little green tea in this Genmaicha mix. It tastes like cooked rice krispies instead of tea.I mixed this with other green tea to use it."
2,Too expensive for subpar product,"I love genmaicha and thought I would try this out because of the high ratings. Boy was I disappointed to learn that my local Chinese market sells the same exact product for about 60% of the price! I also spent hours going through the tea to take out the woody stems which seem to be a sadly significant part of what is inside the bag. If you can't get genmaicha from anywhere else, this still makes good tea, but look around your local Asian market first for a better deal and possibly better quality. Specialty websites for tea likely have better quality, but for a higher price - may be worth it."
1,Quick to Break,"We purchased one of these wind-up lights a few months ago at a local retailer. Recently, during a brief power outage, I grabbed the Freeplay flashlight and wound it up. Imagine my suprise when the spring control mechanism broke inside the flashlight and the thing spun up to a rate I considered dangerous! We put the light down and got away, just in case it flew apart. Using regular flashlights (with batteries) and looking through the clear case, we were able to see stripped gears and bands in places they shouldn't be - and clearly read the danger label inside the flashlight (no user serviceable parts).Well, we returned the light and got our money back. We're 0 for 1 with Freeplay products. I don't think they'll get another chance at our house."
5,MonK: Season 8,I enjoyed watching Season 8 of Monk. One of my favorite episode is Mr. Monk and the UFO. I did not have any problems with the tape playing on the DVD player.
5,GOOD QUALITY...,I HAVE A LOT OF YEARS UNDER MY BELT AND NOW THAT I'M RE-TIRED AND HAVE TIME I CAN PICK SOMETHING ENTERTAINING---NOT SO MUCH NOW DAYS UNLESS YOU LIKE VIOLANCE SEX AND KILLINGS...MY HUSBAND GOT ME TURNED ON TO THIS DRAMA/COMMEDY AND I ENJOYED IT...A STORY ABOUT A DE-TECTIVE THAT ONCE WAS A POLLCE MAN BUT WAS PUT ON LEAVE BECAUSE HIS WIFE WAS KILLED AND HE WAS TRAMIZED BY THIS BUT THE POLIC E DEPT. NOTED THAT WHEN HE OFFERDED ADVISE ABOUT A CRIME SCENE HE BROUGHT UP UNSCENE CLUES..SO TTHEY USED HIM BUT GAVE HIM A NURSE TO HELP WITH HIS OTHER ISSUES...II RECOMMENDD THIS SHOW SERIOUS BUT SPRINKLED WITH COMMEDY....MRZ A BONETTI
4,Review of the last 2 episodes of Monk Season 8,I thought that the final 2 episodes of Monk's 8 seasons was excellent and very fitting. Thanks to the writers and the cast.
5,Superb,"It's a cross between a death in the family and your children leaving home for good (finally!!) Monk is done, though not gone. Tony Shaloub is a superlative actor as the OCD King of Detectives. I delayed getting into this series for a long time, but when I did, I found rich, funny and rewarding entertainment. And I wisely bought the entire DVD series in installments, thereby avoiding obnoxious and ubiquitous commercials that just break the mood. This is already a general classic and will probably rank high among cult classics in no time. Do yourself a favor and get this to complete your set. And if you're new to Monk, by all means start at the beginning, going season by season."
3,Big problem,"This last season was great and delivery was so, so. But when I went to play the last disk on this season eight I had problems with freez framing."
3,Ending is terrible,"I am a big fan of Monk. I liked all the episodes except the last two episodes (Mr. Monk and The End, part 1 & 2), it was just awful to watch them. I couldn't believe the last episodes was from the same writers. Just too predictable, story/mystery development not coming anywhere near the usual Monk standards, the most important case for Monk handled very poorly by the writers.On the whole I give this season 3 stars."
5,"Great series, so sad to see it end","I loved the last season. I was worried about how it would end.But the writers did a great job at wrapping everything up nicely.I just wish they would make more Monk seasons, or even a Monk movie. I would recommend Monk: Season Eight. I really enjoyed it."
1,Technical Difficulties - Never got to see all of it.,My son rented this and never really got to watch it because of techinical difficulties beyond our control. It ended up being a waste of money. I would be hesitant to purchase again.
5,Monk,"I don't get the USA network but I am a HUGE Monk fan. I have to wait for the dvd release, then hope my library gets it and then be put on a waiting list. I could not wait for Season 8. I had to own it. I've only seen 10 episodes so far but it is by far the best season of all. The stories, the little 'healing' things you notice about Monk. I'm excited to finally be able to see the ""Sharona"" episode and the last two episodes."
5,Best Season Yet.,"This season of monk is the funniest one yet and the most entertaining, what a way for monk to go out. Thanks for the memories Mr Monk, and Sharona made a mistake leaving early."
4,Husband is hooked!,"My husband was skeptical when I bought this for him. But we both love it. Anyone can squeeze in 20 minutes, and it is hard but enjoyable. Jay himself is quite likeable, and he knows what he is doing. We have taken this with us on vacations and even used it from our laptop. I usually do a few extra pushups and triceps dips at the end, though. If you are already in ood shape, you may need a little more."
5,LOVE IT!,This really works. No fooling! 20 Minutes a day and results in a very short time. Watch the change in your body. See the difference in your clothes. It is fun and you can do it in the comfort of your home. I guarantee you will feel great and in just a few short weeks you will see your clothes start to fall off. I have gone down almost 2 sizes. Summer is coming. You owe it to yourself!
