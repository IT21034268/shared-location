2,I just don't feel it.,"Man, did I have high hopes for this album. I had even pre-purchased it on Amazon.com. But when it came to my house, 2 days after it was released on shelves (grr), I popped it in the cd tray and almost cried. Sure, the songs ""So Long, Astoria,"" and ""In This Diary"" were great because it had that ""Blue Skies..."" feel to it, but they just tore the rest up. The music was bad because they made it way too melodic, and it was just another pop-punk disaster. He even tried to sing like a back street boy in some of the songs, leaving out his classic grungy, almost screaming, vocals. And all you Ataris fans out there; I know you wanted to cry when you heard the remix of ""I Won't Spend Another Night Alone."" It was god-awful. This album [is bad except] two songs I mentioned where good and throw the rest away."
4,very emotional,"every song on this cd is like a letter. som songs will make you cry you can find out for yourselve all together 7.5/10""i remember waiting for to come/ i remember wiating for you to callwaiting never to find nothing at all"""
2,"Uh, haven't we heard this before?","Well, it's not BAD...but it's essentially the same album as End is Forever, which was essentially the same album as Blue Skies, which makes me wonder why some people are so ready to praise the same songs with the words switched around. Seriously, was there ANY chance we were going to get through So Long... without hearing a song about Kris's daughter? Don't lie, you saw it from a mile away. Song about the deception of love? Check. Song about childhood memories? Check (half the album in fact). When you consider the Ataris were never musical pioneers to begin with, there is really no need to hear this album. Come on Kris, let's hear something new!"
4,Buy It For Boys of Summer,"To be honest, there's one reason and one reason only that I bought this record - ""The Boys of Summer."" I'm not particularly a fan of neo-punk and were it not for the Don Henley remake I wouldn't have considered buying Astoria. However, having said that, I think that one track alone is worth the price of the CD. The rest of the album is the standard 16th note, linear, non-dynamic drone that characterizes the genre. If that's what you like then go for it. The message of the lyrics seem pretty positive compared to the rebellious tendencies of neo-punk bands doing their best to copy the real punk bands, so if you're considering it for your kids it seems pretty innocuous.Bottom-line: Get it for ""Boys of Summer"" - it's worth it. The version is great, although I wouldn't have minded a little more dynamics. However, I wouldn't expect too much beyond that."
2,Not the Ataris that I grew to love,"Seeing all these flawless reviews sparked my need to write a review. While the Ataris are a band that I respect a lot, this cd is what I hoped it wouldn't be. Now in my opinion, they didn't ""sell out"" when they went to the major label. They have been slowly going to a slower more emo-ish sound, and that's fine. But for any die-hard fans of ""Blue Skies"" this is nothing like that cd. This is by far their slowest album and the tunes aren't as catchy as in past efforts. The Ataris have stayed true and haven't tried to appeal to the MTV audience even though they do have a video, but why not if you have the means to do so? Focusing strictly on the music, this is not my favorite kind of music, but it is decent. I wished they went back to their old style of punk though. This is one band that I wish hadn't grown up."
1,Please!,You call dis punk? THey sing like whiny little babies! God they suck! This some of the most horrible music I've ever heard!
5,fast is good,"i was pleasantly surprised by this cd. i didn't like how fast the music was, but then after listening to the very deep lyrics i fell in love. remember the days of old never sounded so good. buy this cd, give it as a present. i promise whoever gets it will consider you the hippest MOFO around :)"
2,Corporate Punk At Its Finest.,"Only being an Ataris fan for only a short time my opinion is that So Long Astoria as compared to the Ataris' previous albums falls short of my expectations. Long gone are the blistering riffs such as the Last Song I Will Ever Write About a Girl. No more is the angst which lured me to this once brilliant band. They traded in their indie-esque roots for corporate glory. And they succeed. Highlight (the only one) track a cover of Don Henley's ""Boys of Summer."""
4,wait a minute,"This isn't really even a review of the album, but somebody else mentioned that ""Boys of Summer"" was some arena rock hit. It wasn't, it was a song by Don Henley. He's not arena rock. The Eagles weren't even arena rock. If you're going to post information about music, take off your stupid ""punk rocker"" leather wristbands and do your homework."
3,sold out?,"this could be a good concept punk rock album but definitely not the Ataris,maybe their new label made them more softer,less interesting and a bunch more commercial....well,I'm not of those guys who blame the record labels but this time Columbia had a lot to be with this punkless new Ataris album......what's next,Avril Lavigne on Punk-o-rama 8"
3,Expected Better,"The Ataris have always been my favorite band because of their emo lyrics and punk edge. In So Long, Astoria.. they lose the punk edge that was so appealing. They still have decent songs and I'll still listen to it but it's no contest between which albums are better. The old ones are clearly more unique in style, while So Long Astoria reminds me of Fenix Tx."
2,The Sellout Album,"Its so sad to see the greatness that is the Ataris put out such a dissapointing pop-punk album. The previous reviewer mentioned that this album was the 'real deal' unlike all the other pop-punk songs on the radio. She's right about the radio but unfortunately this Ataris is not the real deal at all, I mean come on, they re-made a Don Henely song. Poorly for that matter. Buy Blue Skys Broken Hearts or any of their other earlier work and forget that they ever put this out."
5,nostalgia in astoria,"well, the ataris thankfully did not let us down. because of their switch to a big name label, we were all a little afraid of getting an overproduced studio album. but instead... that good old ataris magic. this cd is full of nostalgia. i listened to it the first time and stood in the middle of Target with tears running down my face. each song was better than the last. the cover of 'Boys of Summer' is probably one of my favorites on the album. the remakes of 'i wont spend another night alone' and 'looking back on today' were awesome too. the newer songs were incredibly emotional, probably b/c they're from Kris' experiences. (the saddest song, my reply). if you've never listened to the ataris, this is a great introduction. go out, buy the cd, and support the ataris, b/c htey deserve it more than band. ever."
3,"Not bad, not bad at all...","Sure, not every song is worth listening to, but I have major respect for this band. They're classed with other pop-punk bands who I have no respect for at all, but The Ataris are somewhat different. The band is levels beyond other bands in their genre. I can't quite put my finger on it though. I'm not sure if it's the sound, the lyrics, the vocals, or something else. However, I do know that they deserve a listen.I love the fact that they make a reference to my favorite movie ""The Goonies"" in their song ""So Long, Astoria"".Two really great songs besides ""So Long, Astoria"" are ""Takeoffs and Landings"" and ""Unopened Letter to the World""."
1,Pretty [Bad]...,"Okay I've heard these guys were good before this cd, but I don't think I'll ever appreciate them after hearing this album. First the music really [stinks] and the lyrics go against all punk music is about. EX: ""Here in this diary I right you visions of my summer. It was the BEST I ever had!"" I mean what ... is that all about? Just the way he sings it is obnoxious, especially when he says best. Well I can say about this is this another band that's sold out."
4,Good...,"This is a good cd, i personally didn't know that they went to Columbia, and they'll probably get progressively worse after this release, so I'll try and enjoy it. If your new to the ataris and you like this, then get Blue Skies, Broken Hearts, The Next 12 Exits... I think its much better. The best songs are probably so long, astoria, and unopened letter to the world."
4,"So Long, Astoria","This CD is very good. I was very impressed. I have heard older Ataris music, and it didnt appeal to me as much. After hearing ""In This Diary"", I knew their stronger sound will make them that much better. I bought the CD and I am NOT disapointed! Every track has the same feel to it. So if you like one song you've heard, theres a good chance you will like all of them. If you are a older teenager going off to college soon, this CD will remind you of good memories. You'll love if you like the Drive-Thru records bands (New Found Glory, Something Corporate, Mistown, etc...). Buy it, it's well worth it."
2,*Yawn*,"I really want to like these guys...honestly. I own their first two cds and neither of them was ""bad"" but neither one of them stood out either. Each one contained about a 4-5 song ep worth of decent material and a bunch of throwaways. Their cover of Jawbreaker's ""Boxcar"" was simply disgraceful. I could never really figure out why a major label would sign them when there are so many better bands within this pop-punk genre that are far more deserving. Well I figured that maybe the jump to the major label would make them better (ala Blink 182), so I bought the CD. All I have to say is that this is about as mediocre as it gets. It is not terrible, but it is not good either. It is a ho-hum album from a ho-hum band. I guess polished production and big studio budgets are no substitute for talent.If you like music in the pop punk genre use your money and get something better like ""Avoid One Thing"" or even ""The All American Rejects"" they are way better than these guys."
1,This album lacks any purpose,"I heard from a friend that this was a pretty cool band, so without listenng to their music I just went out and grabbed this CD. This is one of the weakest offerings I have ever heard. There is one good song on here, and it is a cover of THE BOYS OF SUMMER. Aside from that it is just a really bland album. The lyrics are just the same old nostalgic ..., and the instrumentals are totally uninspiring.The mark of any good album, is that it has something that stays with you after you turn off the stereo, but unfortuntely, this album is entirely forgettable."
1,The Downfall of the Old Ataris....,"Another band that used to be punk that turns to pop and sold out. I can't believe after listening to this cd that they are even the same band. This cd made me lose alot of respect for them. Much slower music than the old cd's, and definately not punk. If you like songs on the radio, this song is for you. If you like punk music, keep looking...."
4,Rock on Ataris,"this is the first Ataris cd ive listened to and overall i was impressed. The songs are upbeat and energetic (with the exception of the sentimental ""The Saddest Song"" written for the leads singer's son), although some lyrics are a *lil* sappy/cheesy. Some of my favorite songs are ""An Unopened Letter to the World"" & ""Summer 79"" I would rate it between a 3.5-4."
4,OK,"I loved old ataris albums, but this isn't even punk, its almost unlistenable. there raw garage band sound is gone and they have just been turned into major label BS pop.The other ataris albums are awesome. go buy one of those. this cd has its moments, but overall is a monotone waste of time.so... buy the old ataris albums and GO TO A SHOW. they are excellent live, and definately buy and old album. unless you like polished, major label, pop."
3,Not as good,"Hello all! I know that I am not a music critic, but I am however a devoted fan, and have been listening to the Ataris for a considerable amount of time. I liked ""so long, astoria"", however I think that the Ataris older stuff with Kung Fu, like ""anywhere but here"" and ""Blue Skise, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits"" was a lot better."
4,SLA - not selling out,"yes so with the major label debut, you're bound to get those who say their 'selling out' they're not what they used to be and so on.and in truth this album does have a different sound to the previous ones. It could be considered a lot more poppy but damn it has got some FINE songs on it.The Ataris aren't selling out, theyre growing up, and so is their sound. this surely is going to be a great turning point in their career.Best songs would have to be So Long Astoria, My Reply, and of course the much loved live anthem - looking back on today.but ityou won't regret it"
1,This is not good at all!,"This reminds me of how bad music is today. What ever happened to the good old days of Maiden and Zeppelin? Anyway, this is bad and the guitars in the terrible remake song ""Boys of Summer"" sounds like a part of ""Flash of the Blade"" by Iron Maiden. So if anybody trys to tell you that this stuff is good just tell them it is more Poison to your ears."
1,The Ataris - Worst CD,"The Ataris are a great band and they were great live, but their new cd ""So Long, Astoria"" is their worst CD i have ever heard from them. They should stick to the ""...Anywhere But Here"" and ""Blue Skies, Broken Hearts, Next 12 Exits"" CDs."
1,Thank You Ataris,"For replacing the greatest summer song, Boys of Summer, with the ilk you call a cover. Nothing like hearing the exact arrangment(minus Deadhead sticker insert Black Flag) of the orginal done with an emo cry...thank you for ruining my summer. Hearing your verison of this song instead of the orginal made this my summer of attempted suicide."
3,Not as good as the old Ataris!,"The new Album is decent. That's really all there is to say about it. It's not the same as all of the previous albums, a little more grown up and a bit less punkish. There's a bunch of hidden tracks on this CD. 2 to be exact, including a remake of ""I won't spend another night alone."" The final word for this album is Different. Personally, if you're new to the Ataris, I'd recommend ""Blue Skys, Broken Hearts Next 12 exits,"" or ""End is Forever"""
5,One of my favorites,"A little while ago my friend was telling me about this band he liked called the ataris. I thought how good can a band be that is named after a video game system from the eighties. I got their new cd the first week it came out to give them a try. I have to say i was more than pleasantly suprised. This cd rocks. There isn't one song on here which i don't like. It is hard to pick my favorites but if i had to they would be summer '79, boys of summer, and the hero dies in this one. I can highly recommend this band to anyone who is a fan of great music."
5,Refreshing new cd,"This cd is one of the best I have heard in a long time. After seeing the video for ""In this Diary,"" I went out and bought the cd. MY first thoughts were, ""WOW!"" The songwriting and feeling the behind the words makes this a great cd to listen to over and over again. Also the cover of Don Henley's classic ""The Boys of Summer,"" was awesome. I highly recommend this cd."
5,The Ataris get big!,"Hey all!! Been listening to the Ataris for a damn long time now, since about '97. It is only fitting that since the mainstream has now hijacked Good Charlotte and NFG, that the Ataris get theirs. Much as I'd like to have this band as ""my underground favorite"" forever, there is no way that any other band deserves the success that these guys do. ""So Long, Astoria"" simply kicks [it], just like all their other CDs. It is the album that will break the Ataris big(ger) world wide!! Try ""My Reply"" (#4), it's my personal favorite. Good luck to Kris and the crew, and BUY THIS CD!!!"
5,get this CD,"well, guys i have to say that this is an awesome CD. you guys should all check it out. i really liked the newer version of ""i wont spend another night alone"" which was hidden... tricky tricky :) another awesome song on this CD was the cover of ""boys of summer"" and the new version of ""looking back on today""... i originally heard an acoustic version of the song. this was a good CD an i recomend the new everclear CD too... slow motion daydream"
1,The worst CD EVER,"I cant stand this cd. The Ataris were good b4 they sold out on mtv, and are doing pepsi deals on the WB."
1,"found myself saying ""i've heard this before""","i bought this album because ""boys of summer"" got stuck in my head. i thought itd be something new and fresh. i struck out there. after the first song everything sounds repetitive. i got bored by song 4, since i somewhat enjoyed ""in this diary"". i wanted to enjoy it, i really did, but it just seemed so recycled. every song seemed to try and make teenage girls cry. im not a girl but the only time i contemplated crying was when i realized i couldnt get my 15$ back. sure it sounds a bit different from the run-of-the-mill stuff we're getting today, but not by enough. every verse and chorus could be played over one riff, its that identical. im all for a band keeping with its style, but that doesnt mean the style has to be narrowed down and boring. i wouldn't recommend this to many people. sorry, its just weak"
3,"Less annoying, but more boring","I bought this CD at the same time as Blue Skies, and I enjoy them both about the same amount. Whereas Blue Skies had better lyrics and probably better songs, the sheer amount of whining that went on within Blue Skies was enough to turn me off from that release from time to time. Astoria is not nearly as bad in that manner. ""The Hero Dies In This One"" is not only one of my favorite Ataris songs, but one of my favorite songs in general, and I also like ""My Reply"" a lot. There are a few songs on here, like ""In My Diary"" and ""Unopened Letter"" that are just boring. So as far as the ataris go, I find their older Indie stuff too whiny, but their newer stuff too boring. This leaves me in kinda a Catch 22. Oh well, guess I'm not a big Ataris Fan, that's my reccomendation to you, don't buy this unless you're fairly certain you are."
1,so long to the ataris i used to know and love,"This CD is definitely by far the worst of all the Ataris'. On the day it was released I went down to the record shop, excited to buy it after seeing them live a month before they were awesome and I couldn't wait to listen to So Long Astoria. It is different from their old stuff...way too whiney and boring. I listened to it once and have not touched it once. It definitely is one of the worst CD's in my collection and since this release I haven't been bothered to see them live again- not if I have to hear them play songs from this album."
1,Frusrated gamer,"game will install, but prism error occurs. the game has been uninstalled several times. game patch for this problem also has errors. the site for the patch has not been checked in two years."
1,Bad experience,We could not get this to download to our laptop on Christmas day. My little grandson was disappointed and crying.
4,A book to read,"Charrette, Robert N. Initiation To War. New York, New York: New American Library 2001.279 pages.Robert Charrette's Initiation To War is a Si-fi action thriller based in the year,3061, in witch many planets have been colonized. Human mow wage war against each other in two or more story tall war machines called Mechs. The main character of this story is Tybalt Kelly. Tybalt faces many unique challenges on his way to save his country, the Country Shu. The neighboring country is ready for war on the planet of Epsilon E. Kelly (is what he is like to be called) becomes a Mech pilot.The fight for the countries very survival has began. Kelly will learn that begin that war costs mare then just a leg."
3,Standard remixes for a beautiful song,"Well, by most standards in soul, Sade is superior especially for her delivery of simple songs. By Your Side is a simple song with simple lyrics, delivered in that alluring Sade-style. The remixes here sound almost the same to the album version except for the occasional uptemponess...only the reggae remix is slightly more different. Sadly, the Ben Watt mix is not commercially released and that by far, is the best mix of all...There is one other salvation, the video is included here...another beautiful and surreal video..."
2,Sadly disappointed,I was very disappointed with this new release which took 8 yrs. in the making (?). She opted for a watered-down reggae sound that just went over my head and on the shelf. The first release is good and the title track ('Lovers Rock') is an ultimate groove! Can't say I really enjoyed listening and the wait is now agonized...but don't take my word for it.C~
3,"Ok, but not what I wanted","It was HUGE!! I wasn't expecting it to be as big as it was, especially since I planned on using it for coffee. I wouldn't buy another one, but if you are looking for a BIG canister that looks nice, this would be great!"
4,More extensive than expected,"The actual amount of vocabulary and the kind of words it has is certainly better than I expected. It's only draw back for people who are serious about learning the kana is that it has too much romaji.(meaning the Japanese words are written in the English alphabet) This is fine for those who are dedicating themselves to spoken Japanese only, For those who are trying to learn written Japanese though Romaji is a crutch best abandoned early. If you get to used to looking up a word with its Romaji spelling than it will be very difficult for you to find words in more advanced dictionaries that don't use Romaji. Even though this dictionary has more words i also recommend Oxford's Beginners Japanese Dictionary so that you can become more familiar with the way words are organized according to their Hiragana and Katakana spelling."
3,Not the one pictured,"The one pictured is not the one I received. The one I got is quite a bit smaller (about 3""x4"") and has a green and yellow vinyl cover. It's still a great dictionary (which is why I gave it 3 stars), but it's got that tiny print that is kinda hard to read. I am going to keep it, because it will be good to keep in a pocket while out and about, but I am still gonna try to find the one I really wanted elsewhere."
3,MODERN WOMEN?,We were shocked! We were really shocked! We don't understand why Carol destroys John's life. She can't take an advantage out of this. And all John's efforts and ambitions are in vain. IS THIS THE BEHAVIOUR OF MODERN WOMEN?
2,"""Tenure Turns Tragic""","The imagery of focused academia and the discontinuity of John and Carol's conversation can be defined as a constant stop n' go. You find yourself wondering if the structure of ""Oleanna"" will transform a change of pattern from interupted dialog to a free flowing comprehensible conversation. You want to talk irritating-its all here. John the ostentatious Professor is developed into this pompous character and Mamet creates a twisted tone of pathetic sympathy hitched with misappropriated authority. Will John's foolish indoctrination jeopardize his tenure? If you can get through the continuation of interrupted dialog - lots of credit to you!"
3,Picking Scabs,"This is a very well crafted play that cannot be read lightly. It will make you sick, however. The battle of the sexes and so forth and so on. I like to think of better things, and better people. I wouldn't read it again - feels like picking a scab."
1,Never a complete sentence!,"I disliked this play very much. It is little more than a vehicle for William H. Macy (a fine actor, who is typecast) to stutter and seem confused for 90 minutes. Imagine watching the Macy character in Fargo for 90 minutes! I was expecting tremendous dialog as in Glengary Glen Ross-- I was very disappointed. The dialog in Oleanna was obtuse and difficult. The theme of politically-correctness became tiresome very quickly. This play has very narrow appeal and was obviously a pet project by a fading playwright. Bottom-line: it gave me a headache."
4,Skilled dialogue drama which does not overpower,"This is a fast- paced little drama in hard- hitting colloquial language. Two characters a university teacher and his student are the whole action. It begins with the girl student petitioning for a passing grade, but in time becomes complicated by her charging the teacher with harassment. As their dialogue is going on the teacher is also having to deal with the purchase of a house, and family problems. Both teacher and student feel failures but somehow the common element of their situation does not bring them to sympathetic understanding and conclusion.Obviously this is a look at the new 'politically correct' ethic which has infested much of campus discourse and life.I found it an interesting exercise. But it somehow did not move me on a very deep level."
4,Difficulties of Mametspeak,"If you read this play on your own you risk to loose the red line, because there are a lot of interrupted sentences. At the beginning you get no introduction. So you can only guess what happens. Nevertheless the further you read on the more you realize the problems of the two persons. Mamet picked up a very actual topic about sexual harrasment and misusing of higher positions. I can recommend the play for those who are interested in gender discussions."
3,"""Oleanna""","I should preface this review by stating that I am not an actor or a theater student, so my reaction to the play simply is that of a reader. I enjoy reading plays for fun, but I am not a Mamet scholar or anything, so, though I know that this play is esteemed and the work of Mamet is well respected, I have to say that I didn't enjoy reading this play. The choppy sentences made connecting with it very difficult for me, and I tried to imagine how the dialogue would be pulled off in front of a live audience...and I couldn't. I thought that I would probably feel just as frustrated.STILL: the play is valuable, of course. It is important in its exploration of very sensitive topics, not least of which is the power dynamic present in teacher/student relationships. I enjoyed these aspects of the play and found the shift in tone and dialogue masterfully accomplished. I am glad that I read the play, but I don't think it is my favorite Mamet drama."
4,unbelievable story,"I enjoyed this book. It was hard to put down. What an amazing story. It was a page turner that is for sure. Cannot believe he gave up his dog tags, ended up in a concentration camp. It reads like an espionage thriller. Well done."
5,Amazed again,"Thomas Childers has done it again - a truly amazing recount, from a very personal view, of another air war story from WW-II. His previous ""Wings of Morning"" was spell binding and yet here is ""In the Shadows of War"", another captivating book to be read over and over."
4,In the Shadows of War; An American Pilot's Odyssey,I purchased this book as it contained the story of my very dear friend Warren Bauder. He is one of our many quiet heros. The book gives a good deal of information of what some of our quiet heros did during WWII.
1,A note about the existing Fox Lorber transfer,"While the quality of the NTSC VHS tape is very good, there is one major flaw in the Fox Lorber version of this film: the transfer is missing the last five minutes of the full version.The Fox Lorber transfer ends with David Holzman being forced to confront his ex-girlfriend Penny, after being caught by a policeman filming Penny through her window from the street. The last words on the the Fox Lorber transfer are: "" ...Penny said forget it."" These words are said over black.It's as if the person in charge of the transfer got bored or impatient at this point because this is where this transfer ends. The film should go on to show Holzman having his film equipment stolen, ending with a series of photo booth shots.This film is an important film and deserves better treatment than this. Fox Lorber please redress this problem and retrieve the existing faulty transfers. I look forward to a time when we can see a complete version of this film."
2,Only interesting from standpoint of background shots,"I lived during during the 1960s and was in NYC from time to time. So consequently the outside film shots were somewhat interesting, but the tedious boredom of ""Holzman's"" life (doesn't matter it is faux) is draining as a viewer. I enjoy documentaries (faux or not) and this is very shabby compared to so many other films. I could not endure it to view it more than once and the 74 original minutes was about my limit. My video did include the last part (which was somewhat interesting except you wonder if this is a mockumentary, why does he have the beginning of the movie after he was robbed?). Ah, questions, questions, questions, is that the only thing that this video does for the viewer?"
1,gross and disgusting,Still haunted by scenes I wish I'd never encountered. A comedy? Not even an amusing satire.
1,Resentment? More like revulsion,"The title may see it all--Gary Indiana seems to resent everyone, especially if they're attractive or intelligent (like Dominick Dunne). He has no insight into the people he so recklessly attempts to portray (even minor characters that are easily identifiable), and he seems to think that he can aim poison at them without regard. The whole thing backfires--including his weird views about Southern California--and the reader ends up laughing at this silly concoction, not at the characters involved in a real tragic event."
1,Cruel and outrageous novel,"The characters in this book are all easily identifiable, centering on the participants in the famous Menendez Brothers trial. Not one of the participants escapes Indiana's venomous attitude and ridicule. Even the minor characters involved in the fringes of the trial are objects of contempt. This trial involved real and serious issues, and Indiana has reduced them all to props to be aimed at, by him. Perhaps someone will write a novel with him as a character; there would be a lot to satirize. On top of it all, the book is sloppily written, as if he could hardly wait to set down his attack on living people."
1,A silly attempt at satire,"Gary Indiana continues to write about subjects he clearly doesn't know anything about but would like to--like hustling, like leading an exciting life, like being really famous. All right if he would write from the point of someone looking in, trying to look in, but he doesn't; he pretends he is iside it all, and the result is ludicrous at its best. If you want to know what really went on during the Menendez trial that Indiana so pompoulsy claims to illuminate, read Dominick Dunne's excellent account--and skip this very silly and pretentious endeavor."
1,blank,Did'nt work. I purchased Chicken Little Nintendo Game Cube though Amazon from Spotlight Media Solutions Inc. For my grandson's 6th. birthday He put it in and nothing just come's up blank It was used said it was in very good condition showed no signs of any wear just nothing Blank :(
3,Fun game bad information,"I wanted a multiplayer game, and this game has limited multiplayer at best, yet it states that it is multiplayer. As far as the game, it is pretty fun - but don't expect very good multiplayer from this game."
3,Overall good...could be a teensy bit stronger,"I've bought this coffee many times, both through amazon and in stores. I find that it's a decent brew but the flavor that's supposed to come through is very subtle. Also, the packaging is a little bit of a bother for me. I'd like a little description of a product & flavor when I buy coffee and usually you get that in other brands. But Arbuckle's doesn't provide that on their packaging so you find yourself guessing at what the flavor is supposed to taste like when u drink it. Also as written in my subject, the coffee is a bit on the light side. I've tried brewing with 2 packs, but that didn't cut it, so now what I do if I'm brewing this I usually mix it with my own gourmet French Roast just to give it some kick. That works, but then it kinda masks the supposed flavor of the coffee. Overall, I guess it doesn't hurt to try it, but for me I've gotten better flavored coffee elsewhere. As I said, it's tasty...just didn't have that WOW factor!"
5,Great purchase,A friend had these at the course one day and I knew I had to have them. Very satisfied with the purchase.
2,Needs fact checking,"I was disappointed in this book. I had only read a short while before I found several errors. Because there are only one or two facts on each page, there's not really a lot of content, so they should have had the time to check all their information. For example, they say that only Texas is allowed to fly its state flag at the same height as the U.S. flag. This is a Texas tall tale, as discussed at www.snopes.com. They also say that only Costa Rica is forbidden by their constitution to have an army. Wrong -- it's also forbidden in Japan."
2,More Fact Checking,"Yes, this book needs more fact checking and maybe some rewording of questions. Some examples, Laurel and Hardy did NOT win Oscars for their performance in Music Box in 1931. Yes, Music Box won for best short comedy (oscar.org), but Laurel and Hardy were not even nominated for their performance. Also, Julius and Philip Epstein were not the only brothers to win an Oscar for the same film (screenplay for Casablanca). Remember, Fargo? Our good friends, the brothers Joel and Ethan Coen won the Oscar in 1997 for best original screenplay."
1,horrible experience,"They even couldn't send out the correct item I odered and I had to call them again and again. It seemed there was no communication between different representatives and I had to repeat my story every time when I called them. More anoying, different representative gave me totally different information in each time and I had to cancel the order after almost one month waiting and calling. It was really nightmare."
5,Emotional & Floating space music...,"Ranging from dynamic, rhythmic pieces to ethereal, beautifully floating music, Fourth Universe portrays magnificent visions of the universe.The song titles are often clues to the tempo. The opener, ""Sailing To Neptune"" is a cruiser which rides the waves of the galaxies, while ""Deep Blue"" floats slowly as it spirals deeper, and ""Rhapsody on a Red Planet"" uses classical motifs to envision the desolate planet-scapes of Mars. Flights of fantasy move through deep space, romantic and ethereal at times, upbeat and rhythmic at others. The Geodesium sound is full of clarity, expressing its own view of space and all the sounds generated from these deep expanses. Eighteen tracks altogether make up this nearly hour-long release, marked by an ability to portray magnificent, memorable visions of the universe through its varied approaches to the space music genre."
2,Terrible sound! Kate Beckinsale looks nice.,"Kate Beckinsale is pretty in this, as she always is. What ruined this for me is the sound quality. When Tweedledee and Tweedledum do The Walrus And The Carpenter, you literally can't hear them over some background electric guitar. I'd say find another version or read the book."
3,Kate Beckinsale As Alice?,"I'll keep this review short.Not the best but definately not the worst!I personally prefer the 1985 version ofAlice in WonderlandOriginally, also titled Alice through the looking glass. A two part Television Movie starrig Natalie Gregory as Alice,"
2,Unfortunate,"OK, I'm happy to see ""Through the Looking Glass"" get any attention at all. It too often seems overshadowed by ""Wonderland,"" even though TTLG goes way beyond in some kinds of playfulness and complexity.I hoped for better, though. Acting is erratic, costuming (including wigs and such) goes way over the top, effects aren't very effective, and it never seems to settle on a consistent style. I wanted to like this one, but just can't.-- wiredweird"
4,Is the closest to the book that i've found.,"The movie is the closest to the book that i have found. The beginning is completly different from the book, and they cut out a couple parts. For example the lion and the unicorn scene, which is my personal favorite, did not exist in the movie. And the part with the white knight was also extremely close to the part in the book, but it was so BORING...it just makes you wait for the movie to get over, and in my mind bogs down the movie. But other than that i would recommend this to anyone who is a die hard for the Alice in Wonderland series."
4,Looking at Alice through the Glass.,"The movie sticks pretty close to the book, however there are a fair number of characters in the book that are not contained in the movie, of course there are a large number of new characters in the book that were not contained in Alice Wonderland."
3,Great for all ages,"Alice Through the Looking Glass is a great interprataion of the book, however I was slightly disapointed with it because I was on Amazon searching for the version I remember when I was a child, all I can seem to remember was two women walking through a garden with huge dice or something of that sort on their head, I don't know what version that was, but it certainly wasn't this one. This version is excellet though and clearly defines nonsense language. A bit lenghtly in parts, this film is good for all ages."
3,Ok movie,This movie was an interesting rendition of Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Can't say it's one that I'm going to watch again. A bit long winded in my opinion.
2,How disapointing,I love Alice in Wonderland (the book) but this movie was just off. The filming style was very unpleasant and the actress playing Alice was actually an Adult. They couldn't make wonderland any dryer.
1,what the heck was that???,"I was looking for a simple story of the original Alice in Wonderland and this dvd had pretty good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try. I barely made it through 30 minutes mostly waiting and hoping it would improve. I suppose if you enjoy watching inanimate objects, vegetables and chicken carcasses dressed in clothing and dancing you may like this. What this had to do with the story I have no idea. It was ridiculous and not like the original Alice that I remember. There is 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back! Thanks."
2,:( Sadly :( Disappointed :(,"I am an Alice fan, so this is far far from my favorite. The first star I gave was simply because I love Kate Beckinsale and the movie isn't scary. The other is because It would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that doesn't know anything about Wonderland. My 9 year old even got bored with this. Kate Beackinsale plays the Mother in the beginning, and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so. She just didn't look well in this movie, and everything looked so cheap and fake. The story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out. I would not recommend this. I would recommend the 1999 American mini series of Alice in Wonderland, it is my absolute favorite; with Martin Short as the Mad Hatter, and a long list of big names. That one is fun for all ages!"
1,AMAZON - PLEASE GIVE US '0' STARS FOR A CHOICE,"A truly horrifyingly bad attempt.Astonishingly badly cobbled together from beginning to end.Dreadful acting.Terrible concept.An embarassment the likes of which one hasn't seen in a great, great while - and hopefully will not see again in this lifetime.AVOID AT ALL COST - EVEN FREE."
5,"Michael Speaks, A beautiful and soulful voice!","Missing you is a beautiful song and is very well sung, but what makes this ""single"" CD great is the third cut. I have been trying for months to find out who sings this song. I found it on my computer without any ID3 tags, but knew it was associated with Set if Off somehow. At first I thoguht the singer was Johnny Gill then realized it was not. I emailed copies of it to many of my friends asking if any of them knew who that singer was, but no one knew. Finally, tonight, I found the Missing You CD and popped it in and violla! The song is called So, Right, For Life and is sung by Michael Speaks. What a beautiful voice. If you like Jonny Gill's voice, you will love Speaks'. I will be ordering a CD he relased years ago, but it will be a new and great find for me!"
3,best single,i think is the best single ever produced.this single from the motion picture' set it off' has taken the world by storm.
5,The Toddler's Bible,The Toddler's Bible content is perfectly worded for the vocabulary of my 21 month old son. There are just a few sentences on each beatifully illustrated page so I am able to finish reading and then have him turn each page. It is a wonderful start to sharing the Bible stories with our son.
3,VERY simplified,"This is a book of *very* simplified Bible stories. My 22-month-old son has a pretty good attention span, and I think he would prefer stories with a bit more information. However, if you want the story of Joseph, for example, to be told in 2-3 sentences, this is the book for you!"
2,"good, but not enough detail","I bought this for my 2-year old, and was disappointed - each story is wrapped up in just a few sentences. So they're not so much stories, more like very brief summaries."
2,"Far too little detail, even for toddler stories","We received this as a baptism gift. We put it aside, since the baby was newborn, and when our child was two years old, we pulled it out. The stories are so incredibly short, they hardly even make sense. Literally about eight lines (under 40 words) each, and a portion of that is often something like, ""Do you think God helped him?"". I put it back on the shelf and came onto Amazon to shop. Growing up, I had the classic ""The Children's Bible: The Old Testament, The New Testament by Rev. Joseph A. Grispino, Dr. Samuel Terrien, and Rabbi David H. Wice"", and this is just far too simplistic. I am looking for something with a lot more depth. Don't waste your money on this, you can create better summaries yourself on the fly!"
1,Skews Stories,"I'm well read in the Bible and many of these simplified stories add things, take things out, and sometimes completely make things up. This is not a good kid's Bible. I don't think it's ok to change the story of the Tower of Babel and leave out that God confused their language, or to say in Abraham's story that every time he saw a child he was sad because he didn't have a child of his own. This book is very much one man's isigesis."
3,Not for over age 3,"Got this for my daughter when she was 1 1/2 and it worked well when she was very little. She is now 4 and definitely needs a different Bible (what I am shopping for now). The stories are very short and don't have many details. Also, she goes to Sunday school and comes home asking me to read her the story she learned about, and often it is not even in this Bible. This Bible really is for ages 0-3."
1,So so stories,"The stories were a bit too short that it did not have much learning value fir my son. I probably should have gotten the preschoolers version or beginner's bible. I don't know if it's the way the stories were written or my son is just advanced in terms of compression for his age. The stories are too concise in my opinion. However, I wasn't too devasted because the condition it was in was great. It was practically brand new without the brand new price. I was happy with that aspect of the order. It makes me more confident in purchasing items claiming to be used bit in very good condition."
3,It's alright,The pictures are a little too bare or too minimal to keep my son's attention. He's 2. But I expect that perhaps in a few months he'll be more willing to sit down with me and read through it.
5,The Toddler's Bible,This was a Christmas gift for my Great Grandchildren. They really enjoy them. I would recomend this bible for any toddler.
5,This will be great for my 2 year old,I think this is a great starter Bible for 12-36 months. I love the illustrations and the fact that it has so many stories. I would rather have her become familar with more stories than worry too much about how indepth they go at the moment. We can build on that as she grows. Highly recommend.
4,Colorful and catches my Toddler's attention,I like that this book is very colorful. The bright colors and cute illustrations definitely grab my toddler's attention. I think this book really leaves a lot to the parents to fill in the blanks with details. Nice pictures. Not a lot of detail in the stories.
4,quick & easy,"It's quick & easy for everyday clean up after sailing. You still need to buff it a bit, but they give directions for making that quick & easy too."
5,Pretty darn cool,"My wife bought this toy for me on a whim just for fun. I have to say that I was pretty impressed with it. The focal point of this item was the parachute but I prefer the look of the Duke without it. Luckily the chute is held to the figures harness with slide-in tabs that are easily removed. No hassle there. The figure comes very well detailed (the boots and face-mask look awesome), well painted and the articulation works well and unlike many other figures the 8"" line of Joes holds positions well (making them great for display). The figure comes with plenty of accessories (4 grenades, two pistols, a SMG and a larger rifle that is assembled using one of the pistols - there is also a knife, axe and even a bayonet for the larger rifle). Most of the accessories can be attached to multiple parts of the figure as well as his harness - nice! Everything about the toy was top-notch, but this line is pretty pricey in my opinion. They aren't the Joes that I grew up with though..."
4,"GI JOE 8"" Paratrooper Duke","I purchased these for my 3 sons. They age between 4 and 10. All of them love the toy. They will far outlast any of the plastic parachute toys they have gotten in the past. The chute is really durable. Also, it's been a great imagination/play toy and being on different age levels it brings their play together."
1,Bought a new scale within a month,"This scale was off by about 10 pounds when loaded, although it was correctly zeroed.I bought a Salter digital scale that is working well.Also, this scale is big. Too big to fit well in my bathroom."
2,"GREAT IDEA, BUT NO CIGAR","I bought this drive because of the removable SD card. However, the drive has a couple of glaring flaws:1. The first problem is that the male plug connector is too short. The drive won't seat in many USB slots without using the extension cord. If the plug was just a little longer--say, the same size as on the extension cord--it would fit.2. The extension cord is way, way too long and bulky. The drive itself is small and easily carried in your pocket. But if you have to carry the extension cord with it, it's no longer easily portable.Just extend the male plug (about 2/10 of a cent's worth of materials) and this would be an absolute winner!"
3,Too many vocals,"I'm a fan of the Cafe del Mar series and love it for its atmospheric internationalism. I find that most vocals, though, bring the music too much into the foreground. Or, perhaps my taste is just shifting away from CdM..."
3,"Interesting and Solid But More New Age Than ""Chill""","Chill really should be a dance oriented tracks for the day after ... these are pleasant tracks but they tend to be more New Age tracks - nice but not chill in the sense of the previous CD's in the set and not in the dance music sense.Now, if you're a DJ looking for chill-like tracks you can manipulate, twist and drop these on top of other beats - this CD should do the trick for you but for straight listening - not really properly 'chilled,'"
2,Not the color pictured,"The wig is a darker pink than shown. Was not able to use it for my costume so it ended up as a toy in my sons closet. He really loves playing with it, (he's only a toddler), but after a few months its close to being tossed because it is quite tangled and matted looking."
5,my 17 months old son loves this book!,"my son loves this book. i bought this around 14-15 months and he wasn't that interested at the time but now he wants to read it every night. he recognizes the characters from sesame street and he tries to call out their names. it's really cute. the book has pretty fun rhymes, so it's fun to read it for him as a parent. i plan to buy more books in this series."
5,Easy to narrate like the Cookie Monster,My kids love this book because Mommy sounds like the Cookie Monster when reading it. This is what makes this book a 5-star. The story is also cute and the kids love seeing all the familiar monsters.
5,"Soundtrack to the movie ""Manhole"" by Grace Slick","When this album first became available in the 70's it was a continuation of the Jefferson Airplane/Starship saga that was part of the San Francisco sound that rocked our nation. The public and personal adventures of the members of that band and all of the rock icons that communed with them were an inspiration to many of us. As the members of the band came and went, and the paramutations sometimes equalled the efforts of those working under the Starship banner, the themes changed and the fame came and went. But my facination with Grace Slick never wavered. And although her auto biography ""Grace Slick, Somebody to Love?"" gave some insight and carried me along, my enjoyment would never be complete until I was able to share with my fellow fans this CD. Thank you, Wally."
2,disappointing,"I love her voice. I bought it because I wanted to hear her strong singing, but most of the album had her either in the background or didn't feature her at all. A couple of songs did showcase her strength, but it's not enough for someone who just wants to hear her sing. Disappointing album."
5,"Sorry, too expensive for me","I'm going to assume this is a great piece of music, from a wonderful legend. If you are under 50, you could not have been at the Airplane concerts, take my word for it.But release a few for we ordinary people. I wont pay $75."
5,It's Only Music...,"Manhole is another of the must-have Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship releases if you are a fan of the JA/JS sound. Produced by Grace, Paul Kantner, and David Freiberg, this original 1973 release continues with the sound that makes this group unique. Epic(#38) and It's Only Music are two of my all-time favorite JA/JS songs and help make this album great. Better Lying Down and Manhole show Grace at her best. And the ultimate message in the song Manhole is one that every person should hear as it is as true today as it was yesterday and will be tomorrow. Thanks to all for making this music available on CD!"
2,Too Much Chipping and Tearout!!,I didn't have what I would consider a serious problem with blade thickness since the shims made it possible to get the widths I needed. But the cut quality was not nearly what I find acceptable. There was noticeable chipping of the veneer of plywood and horrible tearout at the back of the cut. I know I could use a backer board to reduce the tearout but not worth it since it is chipping anyway. Spend a little more and get a high quality set from a name brand maker.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I truly enjoyed the electronic music in the 2004 Astro Boy remake which is why I bought this CD. But none of that was on this CD. Very disappointing.Also, the musicianship quality of this CD sounds like it was played by a high school band. The brass section has trouble staying together allot, as though they had too much to drink when they performed this, otherwise, what music was presented is fairly convincingly together, not tight though. I can't see how Sony Pictures would have released this under their name? The entire disk is intrumental, which is fine, but where is all the great music I heard in the anime series?"
4,Good alternative,"September 2010 Update:I initially purchased this keyboard as an alternative to the full-size keyed Apple keyboard (the one before the current slim aluminum one). However, I would probably be fine with using Apple's new slim one.As for functionality, it's a great keyboard that feels pretty solid for being slim. My only gripe is that the driver to make the volume/eject buttons seems to make a few subtle things in OS X act odd (such as expand/collapse). Other than that, it's a great slim keyboard and cheaper alternative to Apples."
5,Terrific keyboard!,"The best keyboard I've ever had. It's so effortless, it almost types by itself! Sleek design, lightweight and a small footprint. The pain in my wrists is improving after less than 3 weeks of use. Would highly recommend this keyboard for all touch typists. If you hunt and peck, it may take more getting used to unless you're used to a laptop keyboard. Can't beat if for the price either."
5,Feels great!,"I purchased this because my Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse combo couldn't be recognized through my iogear 4-port KVM I bought. The wireless keyboard and mouse worked, but I couldn't use any of the special keys on the keyboard... BUMMER!!I have my KVM hooked up to a MacBook, Windows - Dell Laptop, and a Ubuntu Linux desktop. The keyboard works fine for all situations. I do recommend you download the driver software from the Macally website as the software on the included CD doesn't work with Intel MacBooks."
4,Nice keyboard!,"I love this keyboard, and so does my wife so I am ordering one for her computer as well. It feels almost exactly like the iBook/MacBook keyboard, except it is the full 108 key keyboard. If you like the feel of laptop keyboards, you will love this thing. The only reason I rated 4 rather than 5 stars was there was a bend in the USB plug that made it difficult to plug in. That was as it came out of the package where it could only have happened in the factory making me wonder about their quality control. I have owned other Macally products though and never had a problem with any of them."
2,turned off,"Have arthritis and loved typing with the keys, but the keyboard constantly shut down after one hour's use. Customer service polite but not helpful. I have vista and even made sure drivers were up to date but it just kept shuting down!"
3,nice,"This keyboard is nice and functions great. I can't say it's the best on the planet like some of the other reviews - perhaps their previous keyboard was really bad?? It's got a good feel and is comfortable. Compared to my keyboard at work, it doesn't have as light a touch, meaning, I have to press a little harder on the keys, but that's a minor detail and is purely personal preference. Some people like to press harder on the keys. Overall it's a fine keyboard, solid construction and well worth the price and nice looking."
3,keys too short,"I've had this keyboard as my primary keyboard for about a month now. I'm a touch typist, and have no problem with most keyboards that i'm accustomed to including the white plastic mac keyboard, old laptop keyboard and relatively new silver mac keyboard, but with this icekey, i still keep hitting wrong keys. frustrating. Something about key positioning is wrong. Also, the keys seem too short and dont have enough resistance. Finally, even though i've installed the driver, the volume keys don't work. I found something online that said the drive just doesn't work with my operating system (most up to date OSX). I should have gotten the microsoft keyboard."
3,"Disappointing, buy the Kensington","This keyboard is better than the stock Apple i-mac keyboard for rapid typing, as it has a shorter key stroke. Still, it isn't as good as most laptop keyboards. Some of the key switches squeak when you press them, and one key arrived somewhat twisted out of position, i think because one of the scissors links is tweaked. The touch is a bit heavier than it needs to be, and writing a great deal does make fingers and wrists sore. When going fast, I find that the shift keys don't engage. Overall, I'm disappointed; for the money, the quality ought to be better, with a lighter, smoother, and more consistent touch. Follow up note: this was hurting my hands and I replaced it with a Kensington slim type keyboard (Mac version) and a Belkin USB hub. The Kensington is MUCH BETTER -- crisp, clean touch that doesn't have the slight sponginess of the MacAlly. I recommend you buy the Kensington."
2,Not all features work with Lion,"I am disappointed that the volume and eject keys do not work with my Macbook Pro running Lion. Macally did not provide a timeline for updated drivers. I was initially deciding between this keyboard and Apple's keyboard and will be returning this keyboard and exchanging it for Apple's. The keyboard is decently comfortable to type on. However, I am a heavy user of the function keys on my keyboard (volume, play/pause, brightness, etc.) and these are only supported on Apple's keyboard. If the volume keys worked on this keyboard I would be more likely to keep it."
4,Excellent replacement for white Apple keyboard,"Bought this to replace my aging white Apple keyboard. The keys were starting to stick when hit off-center, which made the data-entry portion of my job a pain (literally). I wanted something other than the slim, silver Apple keyboards of today, so gave this one a try. So far, I'm loving it. Great key response with minimal effort, and quiet. The little notches that help your fingers find the ""home"" position are also large enough that they probably won't wear away, like the dots on my Apple keyboard did.Also it's a very nice-looking keyboard. Not quite as artsy as the Apple ones, but still looks like it belongs with my 24"" iMac. A small ding on the score due to the need to install software for the volume and other specialty keys to work. Other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,"Great item, and SERVICE","I type all day and was looking for a keyboard that would double on a Mac and Windows machine, and this is really fine. Extremely light and fast response, nice heavy base. I got a rare chance to test a keyboard dealer's customer & repair service and was very impressed. The keys use a sort of suspension mechanism, with some little plastic 'forks', and the '1' key along the top started binding within a month or so. They gave me an RMA number and I sent it back and within 2 weeks they sent me what appeared to be a brand new keyboard, don't know if this fixed my old one themselves or what, but all keys work fine and no trouble at all since then. Highly recommended."
4,Icekey keyboard,"I was looking for an external keyboard to augment the one on my Macbook Pro. I am a graduate student working on a thesis and needed more room that a cramped laptop one. Actually, the 15"" laptop isn't bad, but I also elevated it about 5 inches and this, along with the Icekey, is a very good setup. The Macally is very good for the price and does feature a nice length cord so that I could actually pull it off my desk and hold it in my lap, if need be. But so far I've been satisfied with having it stationary. Nice tactile feel and it's quiet, it has additional USB ports (that won't support thumb drives-they need more power). The only downside is I know the bright white color will probably be a bit hard to clean. Overall, I'm happy."
2,IT STICKS!!,"What can I say, it's a keyboard! The only major problem is the keys stick! Until I finally set my default to show on my screen which keys were pressed, I didn't even know what was going on exactly - is the shift key stuck? Maybe the command key? The shift, command, and option keys all stick, whether or not I use them; what's with that?"
4,Does the trick,"This is a good, no-frills keyboard. It's a good alternative to pricey replacements. If you're looking for something inexpensive to replace a broken or dirty (as mine was) keyboard, this is a good way to go."
3,Unimpressed. No comparison to Apple flat keyboard.,"Volume doesn't work. Shortcuts to dashboard are non-existent. It's bulky and they keys are pretty noisy. It works for the most part and does it's job but, next time I need a replacement keyboard, I will just shell out the extra money for an apple product."
3,"Volume buttons don't work, even with drivers","I bought this keyboard for my new mac (OS 10.6.6). Before that I had a more traditional keyboard, but found typing on it difficult since I was used to my macbook keypad. I also wanted a keyboard that had volume buttons on it.Well, typing on this keyboard is fairly easy and the keyboard looks nice, but the volume buttons and eject button don't work at all. They are not apparently designed to work out of the box and require a driver. I tried installing several drivers to get them to work... all to no avail. I would look elsewhere for a keyboard if you have a mac. Even though the apple ones are more expensive, it would be worth it to have a fully functional keyboard."
2,Expect to Replace it in a Year or So...,"I'm writing this review after having the keyboard for about a year, so keep that in mind in comparison to other reviewers who are eager to sing it's praises once they get it out of the box. It's the best looking keyboard I've ever owned and the key response was very good at first (just a light tap was all it took) but over the course of one year the spring mechanism underneath the keys started to wear out and the keys became unreponsive (flat.) The more a key is used (space bar is the first to go) the faster it will lose response.Usage was moderate: two users using it mostly on weekends and nights for 12 months.There is no print screen button which can be an annoying surprise."
3,"Nice feel, but nothing extraordinary","This is a good feeling keyboard which suffers from some other problems.PROS:- Excellent laptop sound and feel. Slightly stiffer keys add to the good feeling.- Inexpensive- Looks good (if you like all white)CONS:- Occasional key doubling. Not exactly keybounce, more like the switch can double register if you press the key but don't bottom it out. Only an occasional problem.- Need to download and install a separate driver to enable the volume and eject keys- the two usb ports are 1.1 only.- shipped in retail box wrapped in plastic. As a result, mine arrived with one of the keys broken.- The 5* reviews are almost certainly fake.OVERALL: I like the feel, the look, and the compact size of this keyboard. I don't like needing to install a separate driver, but that is not a deal breaker for me."
5,4th Icekey over almost 6 years.. nuff Said,"I just purchased my 4th Icekey (in black) to replace my second one that I was using w/ a docking station on my laptop. My first icekey met it's demise when it got wet (the circuit is printed on acetate and will run if it gets wet; bye-bye keyboard), but I was undeterred and got a second one. I bought a 3rd one when I lost a key after moving. I originally got the icekey right when it came out because I loved the ibook keyboard so much and I have never looked back. There is not a better keyboard on the market. I looked at apple's newest keyboards and found that they offered too much resistance (the only Apple keyboards I liked were the original macintosh/Apple IIGS keyboards and the Apple Adjustable Keyboard).I encourage you to go to a store and try this keyboard. A+++"
5,the keyboard ive been waiting for,"i use this on my pc. very comfortable and i am able to type much more quickly because of the short keypath. i am very picky about keyboards. do yourself a favor and get this keyboard. i am not well-versed in apple keyboards but i wouldn't look any further and would buy it again in a heartbeat. one reason i would have given it 4 stars (as a pc user) is the aforementioned lack of volume key functionality, however it is a mac keyboard so i cant really hold macally accountable. cant find any pc drivers.. still the best keyboard ive ever used. very satisfied after 4 months."
1,Very disappointed,"I had just bought a Mac Mini and this keyboard because a friend recommended it. I was looking forward to getting my new system up and running and this keyboard really ruined the day. Here's a quick summary:. Keyboard is not solidly made, feels cheap. Keyboard was not automatically recognized by the Mac OS.. Driver disk is worthless, driver simply does not install.. Phone numbers listed on the files in the CD AND the phone numbers on the website are out of service. A LOT of the keys on the keyboard simply did not work.Plugged in a real Mac keyboard and problem solved. I'm returning this item and don't think I'll ever buy anything from this company."
2,Laptop-style keyboard with odd surface,"Though I could almost live iwth the laptop-style design of this attractive keyboard, I could not live with the extra-friction surface the keys were given (which I understand was not part of the keyboard as originally made). I ended up going back to the Apple-supplied keyboard, and the search continues."
1,Don't waste ur money on this...,"fell apart within a month of normal use. absolutly the worst keyboard design i have ever seen, and can't be repaired like a regular board."
4,MacAlly USB Slim Keyboard-IceKey,"The keyboard works well, is comfortable to type on, and best of all, BootCamp recognizes it on startup with Windows 7 which doesnt' always happen with my bluetooth keyboard"
5,Macally Slim Keyboard,I wish there were 6 stars for this item. This keyboard has a GREAT feel. The lack of depth to the keys makes it very easy to keep clean. It responds well. This was also a great value. Love it.
3,Macallly vs apple (aluminum) keyboard,"I purchased this keyboard hoping that it would be a good, wired alternative to my apple bluetooth keyboard (the latest aluminum model).I was looking for a replacement because the bluetooth keyboard eats of batteries. And besides making your desk look a little cleaner, who needs bluetooth in a keyboard? not me anyway.I guess I must have become accustomed to the compact size of the apple keyboard, because this one is HUGE in comparison. This is actually a standard sized keyboard with a number pad, so it's not unusually large, but I really like the smaller apple model because it requires much less desk space.In turns of key feel, these keys do feel nice, but not really better than the apple keyboard. Both are comfortable to type on. I was hoping that this keyboard would feel somewhat like the great mechanical, clicky key keyboards that IBM (and Dell briefly) used to make, but it's nothing like that. It's not bad, just not at that exceptional level."
3,Decent Keyboard,"I bought this keyboard for my daughter's mini. I have two of the newer Mac aluminum keyboards, and would rate the mac unit superior. Its probably a preference thing, but the key action is a bit stiffer on the macally unit. The price is quite good however, so I can't complain."
2,Does not work with OS 10.4,Unfortunately this keyboard did not work with the G4 PowerPC OS X 10.4. I even went to Macally site and downloaded the drivers for it. Initially the sounds and eject dvd did not work until I installed the driver. After installing the driver the number lock never worked (before or after the driver was installed). Along with the fact that when I typed it started added numbers in between the letters (odd glitch)? so back it goes!
3,"Good, basic keyboard, but...","This keyboard has a good feel, and the buttons provide a nice, positive action. Looks great, decent accessibility to the USB ports on the side. One caveat (and for me it was a biggie): the multimedia keys (volume, etc.) did not register with my MacBook Pro. Some frustrating fiddling around didn't really help. I ended up swapping with a friend's iMac keyboard (much better feel and layout, much smaller footprint). The included software is supposed to enable some of these extra functions but it didn't do go well for me. I'd spend the money and get a genuine Mac keyboard; it really is worth the money."
3,"Good quality, stiff keys, non-ergonomic","The quality is good, but I don't like the USB hook-up. Needs curved shape to be ergonomic. Keys are stiff, but crisp. My wife also thought the keys would build up your finger muscles."
3,"Great keyboard, lousy software CD","I love this keyboard! But the volume and eject buttons, as several reviewers have noted, don't work without installing a separate driver. My Macbook recognized the keyboard, so I didn't install the driver from the CD. Then I tried to adjust the volume - no dice. Inserted the CD and installed the driver. *Still* no dice! Turns out, lamely enough, that the CD that ships with the keyboard doesn't actually contain the driver needed to make the keyboard work! Stupid. So if you're frustrated, Google ""macally icekey"" and install the driver. Then you'll be golden. But, jeez, Macally, why you wasting resources and shipping coasters with your product?"
2,junky keyboardS by macally,"I bought an icekey keyboard in Canada. A year later, it had a short circuit. The company reps in Canada xchangd it for an ikeyslim. A year afterwards, the kys are dying on it - specially the lettr ""e"". They have a crummy feeling when you press on thm - like th keys ar worn out. I requested from macally in the US (where I now live) that thy rplace the kyboard - and they insisted that I pay for the return postag. Grrr!A macally mouse also died on me in short ordr.Hence I really DO NOT RECOMMEND MACALLY PRODUCTS. THEY AR JUNK. Return to th PRC, please!"
3,"Love the keyboard touch, but.....","While I think thi i a great keyboard, if you have young children, think twice. As you can tell, I'm kipping letters. That's becaue my 22 month old daughter was able to POP the keys off and break some of them. I've got 5 kids and have gone through a lot of keyboards for one reason or another, but never becuae the keys have been popped off and broken in the process. My s key especially is bad as the entire stem broke and I ave to stick my finger nail or a slim object into the spot where the key should be. Also, even though we installed the driver, the sound keys do not work. Obviously something is not quite right here... Bottomline: if you don't need to control the sound with the keyboard and do not have young children or sensory seeking children, overly curious children, etc., this keyboard will work well for you."
2,Volume controls wont work,"I have a mac and I cannot get the volume controls to work. I installed the software on the cd that came with the keyboard but that accomplished nothing. I like the keys, and the fact it has two usb ports, but the fact that there are four keys that dont work are a real downer. All and all I will keep this keyboard but Im kinda ticked about the volume controls."
2,Nice keyboard but keys break,"This is a comfortable and nice looking keyboard, but in my experience, keys will break and/or stick prematurely."
1,BEWARE: Only works with really old Macs - no recent drivers,"There is no current driver for this keyboard, buyer beware. I contacted the manufacturer and they confirmed this fact. This product is of no use to me whatsoever."
2,"Save your money, buy an Apple keyboard.","Apparently I didn't read the specs carefully enough before I ordered this keyboard for my new Mac Mini running Snow Leopard. It doesn't have all the keys or functions of an Apple keyboard. For instance there is no F16 key on the Macally. Also the USB ports on the keyboard don't seem to function with many devices.In short, this product may work well with older systems, but I wouldn't recommend it for a new Mac system. I would write a more detailed review, but I'm so unhappy with this product that it isn't worth my time. If I had it to do over gain I would spend a few more bucks and buy the Apple product in the first place."
2,Surprised and Disappointed,"I've used Macally products for a long time and have never had a problem with them, until I got this keyboard. I'm not sure what happened but suddenly it just stopped working. The number pad went first, then the caps key and finally certain keys were unusable. Okay, fine, once in a while you get a lemon. The problem is, I got another one exactly like it and the same exact thing happened. It worked for a few days and then the keys started acting up. I tried both keyboards on two other computers - they still didn't work.It's possible that I just happened to get the only two keyboards from Macally that were lemons. Or it's possible that this particular model has a flaw that will sometimes make it stop working. At any rate, I was very disappointed. Just be very cautious with this keyboard. It's a good keyboard, but after being burned twice, I can't recommend it."
4,Great value for a Mac keyboard,"This is a very nice alternative to the Apple keyboards. It doesn't look as chic, but it doesn't look bad. It feels quite nice to type on. And it's at most half the price.The main inconvenience is that OS X 10.6 insists that it doesn't ""recognize"" this keyboard, even after you install the drivers (which you can download from Macally). But once you get past the annoying dialog, it works fine."
5,Great keyboard!,Great all around keyboard! I actually spilled coffee all over it and it still works completely fine.
1,Buttons stick!!!,"This keyboard started sticking within a few months of buying it. It doesn't happen all of the time, but enough to be annoying. At times it starts doing it very badly, and it enters my passwords wrong (because the buttons stick), and I get ""locked out"" of my websites for a while. Extremely annoying!!! I've had other Macally keyboards work great, which is why I bought it. I would recommend buying a different keyboard."
3,"Sturdy, big","I really like the Apple keyboards, but they're pricey and don't stand up to the mess (food, coolaid, dirty fingers) that children can make of a keyboard. So I bought this. It's bulky, and not perfectly Apple compatible (the sound volume and on/off don't work for me). The action of the keys is not as clean as Apple's keyboards, but it stands up to my grandson's abuse and is reasonably priced."
4,Great keyboard for price,"As with most Macally products this ICEKEY usb keyboard is great. For the price you will not find a better keyboard. The key action and feel is natural and comfortable. It has a great elevation with the optional angled setting. Comes with 2 usb ports on the keyboard which is a cool feature. Works perfect with my Macbook and all of the secondary and Apple specific keys work perfectly after installing the driver.Obviously this is not a luxury keyboard. There is no backlighting, the key labels are laminated or glued on and are not etched into the keys. That being said, it looks very high quality. The actual keyboard itself is matt white and clean looking. The back end of the keyboard is also white, but a gloss look with clear plastic bumpers on the end. If you own Apple products this will match seamlessly."
3,Watch USB Ports,"Overall, not too bad of a keyboard. It was okay. I have slightly larger hands so, I would've preferred the keys spaced out abit more. It makes it easier to type a bit faster. My biggest complaint was the USB ports. I tried plugging in my ipod, and my digital camera and neither one worked. It said it didn't have enough power. Now, I suppose if you want to use both ports for just a mouse or something it might be okay. It just seems rather unfortunate to have two USB ports built-in to the keyboard and have such limited use for them. It is, however, much better than the standard keyboard that comes with the iMAC.Just make sure you test out the USB ports if you buy this to make sure it suits your needs."
4,"Great, except for volume keys","I'm using this keyboard with an iMac G4 running Leopard. Unfortunately, other reviewers are correct -- the volume keys do not function -- and the software patch Macally assured me would fix the problem doesn't. I may yet try another fix snagged off the Internet. Apart from this issue, however, this is a great keyboard."
1,keys are sticking!,"I bought this keyboard less than a year ago and already, the Y,B and 6 among other keys are sticking and barely work! Very disappointing! Initially I was so glad to get a mac replacement at a great price. I guess you really do get what you pay for! I'm going back to the apple keyboard! Typing on this thing is maddening!"
5,As a Saudi I am impressed with this book,"I am an American Educated Saudi businessman living in Jeddah, Saudi Arbaia but I have been doing business with Aramco for the past 20 years or so. I know the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia as well as Riyadh, where my family and I lived for 17 years before moving back to our home town, Jeddah.Saudi Arabia, seen in the eyes of a young geologist armed with little background information, became a fertile ground to develop his exploratory instincts prodded by his young wife through lovely romantic letters. He fell in love with the country and the country fell in love with him. This affair, I believe, fuelled his love for his wife and hers for him.It is a book I am recommending for my children to read to ""re-discover"" their country instead of relying on uninformative and largely incorrect description by satellite media moguls."
4,West of the Galaxy,"Great music for a planetarium or for a session on star-gazing. I use this regularly in the Lancaster High School Planetarium, Lancaster, Ohio."
2,Second rate Jonn Serrie,"If you like space music, buy Jonn Serrie. He has more musical ideas than Geodesium. I bought this one but ended up deleting half the album from my ipod after hearing how poor most of it was. I could do better if I had my own synthesizer and a multi-track recorder. A lot of synth whooshing and crescendos. Ho-hum."
5,A Great Summer--or Winter--Read,"One of the most clever books I've ever read. It's funny, captivating, smart. You'll love the characters and want to take it with you everywhere. A real joy!"
5,"A delightful, wonderful book","""Leaps of Faith"" is a work of love. It is warm, funny, sweet and moving, with elements of suspense and drama. Rachel Kranz tackles major themes of race, sexuality, family and betrayal. She searches her characters with great affection for the best they have to offer and finds an array of human qualities that contribute to a most satisfying reading experience. The book is stylishly written, but in a friendly, down-to-earth way, and at the end of the nearly 600 pages, I only wished for more. I can't wait for Rachel Kranz's next book."
3,One superb track for Love fans...,"Ignore the truly awful cover, ignore the fact that virtually all of the tracks are worse than the originals and buy this album for one thing only - ""Feathered Fish"" by The Sons of Adam - a 1966 psychedelic ""classic"" penned by Arthur Lee that was, unbelievably, never recorded by Love. With a driving beat that's up there with ""7 & 7 Is"", insidious Love-style harmonies and a typically soaring guitar-break it not only sounds like Love but features Michael Stuart on drums and (as rumour has it) Lee himself somewhere in the production. Certainly, it would have ranked as the stand-out track on their first album if they'd got round to recording it... which, of course, begs the question why they didn't. Even more intriguing is why, to this day, it's been virtually impossible to find... anywhere. It's a lot of money to pay for one track but, for any serious Love fan, it's worth every penny."
5,Brazilian Love Affair...,"I already liked ""Brazilian Love Affair"" on the CD by George Duke. Normally, I am let down by Remix CD's, but in this case, I was pleasantly surprised - it's very good! The product (in this case the CD contains 6 mixes) is a good value - and a great sound. If you can get it at a good price, then do so. I rate this disc Five Stars!"
1,Returned and sold as new?,The package for this filter was scratched and looked as it it had been stored in a drawer somewhere. There was no seal to break so I could not determine if it had been opened and returned. A good quality filter should have a tamper proof seal. I don't know if Amazon restocks returns and then sells them as new but other than the obvious damage to the package I could see no other problem. I intend to complain to Amazon. For those of you considering this product you might want to upgrade to a Hoya. Their packaging is pristine and the products are great. All this to save $10.
3,Only get if you are a serious Motorhead fan,"If you want a Motorhead DVD, get Boneshaker. This one is ok, but kind of boring (lip syncing is always boring). I am a huge motorhead fan and the only reason I bought it was for the Killed By Death video."
4,The Classic Lineup,"The Best Of Motorhead DVD is a great collection of many ofof the vintage lineups best tunes all done in a semi-live(lip-sync) setting, but they pull it off perfectly. A few of thesongs are from Another Perfect Day with Brian Robertsonon guitar, all good."
2,This DVD is not so hot,"I'm a long time Motorhead fan, but this DVD is sub par. Lip synced performances that are trite at best. Only good thing is you get to laugh at Brian Robertson in a couple of songs (what a poser!) Anyhow, you'd be better off listening to your cd's, closing your eyes, and imagining the last Motorhead concert you attended."
3,Opinionated author,"The book is only fair....As a vet and a four time visitor to Vietnam, I experienced some of the relationships the author did in Vietnam. I find resentment in her opinions of the US. participation in the war. She seems so naive at times about the war and the people involved. She should have been at Jane Fonda's side in Hanoi.On the other hand, her perceptions of the southern Vietnamese still hold true today. They hold no resentments, are fun loving and hard working people.Some my friends here in Washington State were ""boat people"" or refugees from ""re-education"" camps. This phenomenon was glossed over by the author."
5,A must read for armchair travelers,"I came across this book by chance in my library and decided to read it with no expectations. I am so lucky that I did!!! This book is an absolute gem. The book is filled with human stories about post war vietnam, how people have coped with most difficult situtations arising out of war and occupation. The stories are very poignant and leave you with a sense of what human spirit is capable of...now go and read it!!!"
5,A MUST addition to any CD library!,I love Aldo's music--he is the rare blend of passion and skill that is so hard to find. His music is relaxing yet can be thought provoking and wistful. He channels all his life experiences into his work and it is a gift worth sharing. I again HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this CD.
4,"Camille ""Live Au Trianon""","I don't understand a word of French. But this album is one that you should definitely not pass up! Camille is an excellent performer that engages the listener in a variety of styles including Jazz, Scat,and Pop (just to name a few). If you like to hear music along the lines of Bjork, George Kranz, Laurie Anderson, with a touch of Vanessa Paradis thrown in for good measure, then try this album. Camille uses a variety of tones in her vocals which really enhance her performance. You can hear the audience go wild at times.Bottom line- if you want to hear something creative and different than the typical ""pop music"" that is out today, buy it!"
1,An absolute waste of time and money,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It made no sense; it was not funny; the dialog was vulgar nonsense (not that I object to ""adult language"" when it is appropriate). Don't waste your time or money: too much has been wasted on this POS already."
1,rusted and bent and broken,Bought this more expensive chrome cage thinking that the quality must be higher than the cheaper ones sold here in amazon. Dont bother paying a premium for this crate. We have had the unit just more than a month and it is rusting and our dog has broken welds and bent wire. I would not recomend this crate to anyone I know based soley on the fact of that it rusted in the first month sitting inside our master bedroom.
5,Best of the Best,"I have bought at least 5 different brands of crates looking for one I really liked. This is the winner. It is a quality crate, strong, and has 2 doors. Most of all, it is high quality and looks it. I've bought two of the 36"" size and one 42"". Save your money on the rest. The Precision chrome is the tops."
2,Fortune telling dream interpretation,"I like that this book has so many very specific listings for dream topics ~ 25,000 of them. Last night I dreamed of a wild cat, which in the dream I identified as an ocelot. Sure enough there's an entry for ocelot! The interpretations, however, are often TOO specific, right down to telling you how many days before those very specific results will occur. For example, dream of an octopus and 'within 3 days someone will become very demanding of your time and financial resources.' This strikes me as gimmicky and makes the book more suitable for a fun session with friends than a serious guide for personal dream work."
5,BUYERS _ READ THIS FIRST!!!,I have been selling these books only to find out that this product description is incorrect. This particular ISBN number is for the clasroom manual only. I have reported both the issues with the images and the title. They have changed the title to only the classroom manual and I am waiting on them to change the picture to only the classroom manual. Just wanted to warn everyone that amazon is incorrect on the product description and that this is not a classroom and shop manual package.
3,decent enough,"I bought this just because I'm trying to collect all of Devo on CD. This is not really one of my favorite Devo songs, but it's decent enough. This CD has the album version of the song, an instrumental version of it, and 5 remixes. Listening to it all in one sitting doesn't really get tiring. It all flows pretty well, and the song is catchy enough that you don't mind hearing the hook a bunch of times throughout the disc. The beats are nothing special by today's standards, but if you like early 90s techno, it's not bad.For a limited edition CD released in 1990, there seem to be quite a few new copies still around. That's not surprising, really. Many spuds had tuned out by the time this was released. Lucky for those of us who are only recently collecting this stuff, though."
5,It does what I wanted to do,"No more batteries, just plug in it and move your telescope (my case is a NextStar 4 SE) all day!Batteries are nightmare for this kind of telescopes."
5,Nora Roberts is the best!,"I love all of Nora Roberts' books. She is an amazing author and seems to know exactly what the reader wants the characters to do and say. This book has romance, suspense, intrigue, and mystery. The characters overcome the obstacles and make their way toward each other. A wonderful (if short) read and I highly recommend it."
4,Can you ever go wrong,"With the talented Ms. Roberts I loved this book because it continued the ""Night"" series I read the first book in the night series when I was 15 I started searching for the rest I enjoys Nora there is just no stopping her. The hero and heroine both have there moments but they make a winning pair."
5,A Great Night's Read!!,"Allison Fletcher is going undercover at Jonah Blackhawk's bar...but she wasn't looking to go under covers. But there was something about Jonah that caught her buy surprise. An attraction too big to be denied.Jonah doesn't like most cops as a rule. And yet there's something about Allison that makes him forget she carries a badge...makes him forget just about everything. He's not sure if that's a good thing, or not, but he seems helpless to fight the feeling. And Jonah doesn't like to be helpless.Allison and Jonah have to solve a series or burglaries, while they try to solve the intricacies of their hearts. This is a wonderful brand new addition to the Night Tales series, and there are plenty of cameos to thrill the most ardent fans."
2,Didn't fit item purchased for,"Item was stated to be made for a specific weapon, but didn't fit. Returned item. Return went smoothly and credit issued promptly."
2,"Well made, poor fit.","Makes the gun obvious and difficult to draw unless you're in pants with very roomy legs like 5.11 BDU's. Blue jeans? LOL no, forget it. The time it would take to draw the weapon would get you killed if you truly needed it. Get a pocket holster. I have extremely baggy jeans as I've been losing weight and this thing still makes it hard to get the pants up and over the holster to draw it, it may work with khaki's. This thing is not comfortable at all. Will be sending it back, I can't use it for plain clothes carry unless I'm wearing shorts which makes it useless. The holster did fit the Bodyguard 380 though (size 1). If you had really skinny legs and normal jeans it may work."
4,Ankle's Away,Good holster. Fits great inside my cowboy boot. Very concealable and comfortable. I recommend this holster any time you want to tuck in your shirt.
3,"Good for the price, secure fit.","This rig is pretty good for the price. I have one major complaint - the Velcro retention strap on the inside has a very hard corner, from where it was melted to prevent fraying. This tends to dig into your leg, causing discomfort. A thick sock helped, but it does become uncomfortable after a while. If it weren't for this, I would give it 5 stars.I will say that it holds the pistol very securely to your leg, and it does not move about. I think it felt just as secure without the upper strap as it does with, but I also generally wear it inside a pair of cowboy boots. I bought the size 10 and it fits a Colt Mustang and a Taurus TCP, both in 380, very well."
5,An excellent outline of our indifference toward the future.,"Rohe addresses the natural limits that we face, population, resources, environmental degradation, the earths carrying capacity whose totality is a disease of being indifferent toward these limits. He write with the precision and logic of a lawyer which he is."
2,The Usual Mediocrity for this author,"Living in the Central PA area, I will read ANY ghost books I can get my hands on. For the price, Mrs. Fidel's books are just 'okay'. An okay light read.[...]"
5,The ultimate vegetable gardening book,"My grandfather gave me this book years ago, and I consider it my vegetable gardening bible. I second what other reviewers have said...if I could only have one book, this would be it, and I can't believe that it is out of print! I haven't looked at Seymour's newer book (I'm sure it's great, too) but I cherish my aged, tattered paperback copy of this book and will always consider it my first point of reference."
5,The Best Racing Game Ever!,I think Looney Tunes Racing game is the best racing game ever! The Warner Bros back round is so cool! The karts they drive in are very smart looking.I love how you can throw pies and other things at your aponents. I also like how you can taunt your aponents too! I give this awsome game 5 stars!*****
3,Looney for the looney tunes,a simple race game...but add characters you loved as a kid...and it hits the markas we've enjoyed the WB show all this years
5,Just plain fun!,I saw this game and it looked great. The graphics. The characters. The everything. Even Looney Tunes: Space Race looks great!
1,gee! this reminds me of mario kart 64!,"except worse. worse graphics. worse characters. worse level. merry christmas, and wish someone else a merry christmas, and get them a different game."
2,collapsing litter boxes,the litter maid itself works fine. But the plastic litter boxes are so flimsy theybuckle when you try to put them in place.I bought a box of 12 replacement trays andgot one filter. I have two cats I need the filters badly.I am really disgusted at being ripped off like that.
2,maybe sweet natured but by no means great,"There was once a showcase of groups that featured several DJ's, Tortiose, prefuse 73, Autechre, and Nobukazu. At this showcase, Nobukzu played every good song they had. I happened to buy the record they had on sale, because I so enjoyed their set. However, the recording was not what I expected.There are only 2 songs worth buying on here: anemometer, and sign. The rest is just haphazard bits of audio that a child could replicate by randomly pressing buttons on a sega genesis games sound effects menu.Buy the aforementioned songs on i tunes or something, but dont buy this record if you are expecting an album of music, you will be disappointed. If you like random pointless sounds then maybe this is up your alley."
1,Ugh... boring,"Children may in fact enjoy listening to this CD, because it is much more targeted at them than us mere mortal adults. I really disliked Scope when it came out, but after a few listenings, began to realize that the seeming randomness of the first track (one filled with lots of CD skipping sounds), was really not as random as it first appeared. I really love albums that mask their true identity until a few listenings have elapsed.Unfortunately, Hoshi No Koe doesn't have any depth at all. Especially when compared to Scope. There isn't much more here than a few simple melodies, using tired sounds and uninventive rhythms."
4,"Its plastic, just FYI","The rod is steel, but the cage itself is plastic. I should have read the description more carefully. This may be good, as it will not chip buckets if you get it too close to the side, however the picture looks like its a metal cage, just be warned. As for mixing, it does a good job in that. 30 secs to a minute with an appropriate drill (I use a Milwaukee) and it will have most things mixed."
5,Job well done!,"I bought a five gallon bucket of paint eighteen months ago and then didn't use it until last week, so I had a very separated paint I needed to mix. This mixer was exceptionally simple to use (put in the end of drill, turn on drill) and was able to fully mix the the paint completely in about two minutes. While the instructions give a technique, I found that even pulling the end almost entirely out of the paint did not create any splatter at the speed I was using it at. If you're looking for a product for daily use, you might want one that is not partially plastic, however it was very sturdy and I believe would hold up for a considerable length of time even for frequent use."
5,Squirrel Mixer,The cage design really works to mix thick materials well. Have used for pottery glazes which previously took other paint mixers about 10-15 minutes to mix now only takes 2-3. Great for regular house paints as well.
5,Good Latex Paint Mixer,"This mixer on the end of a good variable speed drill did a very good job mixing exterior grade latex paint. As with any mixer, make sure you have it in the paint and use a lower speed to avoid slinging paint and making air bubbles! I would not use this mixer with heavy, viscous media but it is great for paint."
1,Not thrilled.,"I believe they are intentionally trying to mislead you, this does not include the cement. Although the image they choose to use does include it, they would like to sell it to you for roughly the same cost as the rope."
3,"Its good, but could be much better","Now there are some good songs on this cd, but it was the way most of them were recorded that isn't so great. Basically, they had originally recorded backing tracks, but for some reason, coudln't get the original vocal tracks. In two cases,vocalists re-recorded their songs(Maytals, Eric Donaldson) but for the most part they were mostly recorded over by artists trying to sound like the originals. This isnt always so bad, but the lowest point comes as someone trys to sound like Jimmy Cliff, and ends up sounding like a Hanson brother. I'd say only buy if you are a very dedicated fan of Byron Lee and The Dragonaires."
2,Jai Jai Jai,"If you like this type of music, which is great for massage and love-making, you might agree with me that something is missing to make this CD special. I would pass on it."
5,The Manong Generation,"This book is about my father, Dionisio U. Halog, an American Hero in WW2 as all of the Filipinos who fought for the red, white and blue. The manong generation is explicitly defined in Carlos's writings. My father was one of many who worked the plantations in Hawaii,Arizona and California and when the call to battle rang he joined many brave Filipino warriors do defend American honor. The racism inflicted on these proud men did not break their spirit as Carlos defines that spirit in his many examples. My father is buried in Golden Gate National cemetary with many heroes of our country. I thank Carlos Bulosan for his insight on this generation of proud men and I'm dammed proud tht I'm the son of one of them."
5,Thank you,This book shed some light to me. Mr. Bulosan's story is something I would dearly encourage Filipinos to read and identify their roots.
2,Starts off Great and Tails off...,"The story starts off written really well, and in some parts it seems redundant and rushed with alot of sentences starting off with I. i.e.i went to the market. i saw some white men beat a filipino guy up. i didn't like what they were doing.the stories he tells of his family in the beginning of the book are very heart breaking, but after many several chapters it gets redundant. every turn he makes is a bad one and he always ends up in a bad place. i just wondered if the book was worth finishing, and to me it isn't. it starts getting political at the end about unions and labor movements."
5,great stuggle equals great achievements,"You're a filipino...living in your own house, free to walk your suburbian streets, free to go to any school you wish, free to work in an office, free to interact with anyone you please...but you're not in the Philippines. Have you ever thought about the struggle of your previous generations in order to have this freedom you often neglect? This book is an awakening of spirit and will command your heart to appreciate what Carlos Bulosan and those like him suffered for. All filipinos living in a foreign land MUST READ this great work! And then, ask yourself how can you be a better citizen, a better human being and how much do you respect those around you? At recent times it may be hard to fully understand why being a filipino is a blessing. This book will provide you with a reason to be proud of your heritage and will make you remember forever that you are a free filipino."
5,A life in the eyes of the beholder,"Growing up as a Filipino American, I wasn't as exposed to works in the like of Carlos Bulosan. And it's always interesting to read about early Filipino American History because it isn't something that you are exposed to in your average history class. I think that the era that Carlos Bulosan belonged to, the ""old-world"" or early Filipino American history, is overlooked and not often presented to Filipino Americans today. The notion that our ancestors or predecessors struggled is not shared considering our comfortable upbringing. ""American is in the Heart"" is a reminder to the present Filipino American of what early Filipinos first encountered in their first steps in America. Bulosan's autobiography shouldn't be the only source of the harsh conditions of his time. But it is a fist step in learning that history, as it is also American History."
4,A Fascinating Alternative American History,"This story is set in an alternative America. I think anyone who enjoys this ""alternate universe"" genre of fantasy fiction will find this idea fascinating. In this book, America is settled by the black or African races of the world, and the European or white races are enslaved for labor. It is precisely the opposite of what actually took place in American history. Many interesting notions are explored, and it is a very thought-provoking possibility to explore. It is intriguing to consider what might have been. I believe this is the first in a two book series. I look forward to reading the next volume.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel, ""To Be Chosen"""
5,Captivating,"I have not read any of Mr. Barnes other works. I first came to hear about this book from Heather Alexander, who created the music for this book (entitled INSH'ALLAH) I heartily reconmend any person getting this book to get the music.... I pre-ordered the book and cd and the moment i got them i popped the cd (on repeat) in and started reading and couldn't put the book down until i had finished the book.My emotions were all over the place. i would cry, get angry, and laugh..i was pulled into Mr. Barnes world...usually some books are slow and boring in the beginning NOT this one.. i was hooked from the first chapter.... the characters are ""real""I can't wait for the next book..."
3,"Great idea, good book.","I felt the plot was more along the lines of young adult fiction. Good reading for high school and college students.Speaking color-blindedly, there was really nothing new here: two young boys finding their way in the world that is in the end very much the same, only colored differently. It was a good story, lushly told with some interesting tidbits of islamic culture thrown in. The Vikings and Aztecs were a very interesting part about the novel. I wish the author would write a story about each of them."
5,Awe inspiring Novel,"I could not believe the back pages when I read the description of this book. Some daring writer had actually tackled the impossible--posing a ""what if"" question and fully embellishing it into a novel that transcends ""so-called"" true history. There was never a moment when the story felt implausible. It smacked of realism to a point where the reader almost felt as if she had been transported into an alternate universe.Barnes illustrated more effectively then any college survey course could have hoped to that the thing that causes history to move in one direction or another is miniscule. Barnes did more than just flip the script. He looked at the psyche of Africans and wrote a work of fiction that challenged and entertained the reader. THis book should be a required reading in history courses. It would make for quite an interesting discourse."
1,Simplistic and Poorly Contrived,"Although it is an interesting concept to attempt to transpose the races in constructing a slave narrative, Barnes falls victim to a number of stereotypes, effectually constructing a history plagued by simplistic stereotypes. If you view his attempt at creating an alternative history, you find he has created a mere shell of a plot. He reinforces stereotypes about Africa, the Irish, and fails to create decent character development. This long, simplistic novel was an insult to my intelligence, and anyone with any semblance of intelligence will be offended by the overgeneralizations prevalent in this work. Instead of this work, I would recommend a work by his wife, Tananarive Due."
1,It's been done before.,"This is a story of the injustice of slavery, in reverse. Slavery is unjust regardless of the racial identity of the slave or owner. The plot was obvious and predictable. All the men were strong but flawed. The females were strong victims. What happened to the main charters had to happen for honor to be maintained, no news there. Three times a put down this book, not intending to pick it up again but I thought it might improve. It didn't. This was the first time I read this author and it will be the last."
3,Slavery is bad! Gasp! Who knew?,"Competently written but utterly predictable story. Takes every single cliche of the plantation novel and redoes them, simply reversing the colors of master and slave. Okay read, and probably an amazing revelation if you don't know any history or haven't read many other books."
4,Would Slavery Have Existed in a Black/Muslim World?,"While I found Lion's Blood to be a good read; I was disappointed that the central issue of slavery was not addressed. This book could have been written about the pre-Civil War South except for the colors of the participants. I had hoped that slavery as it existed in actuality would have been different if Blacks were the dominant culture. I wanted to believe that the institution of slavery, while not confined to any culture, would have somehow played out differently under Blacks/Muslims. Lion's Blood creates a world in which there is intrinsically, no difference between slavery under Blacks and slavery under whites. In this world, it is only the luck of the draw. I had hoped that Blacks/Muslims would have proved morally superior to white/Christians."
4,Understated beauty,"Here is a gem. A collaboration of some of the most unique people you've ever met. A great Minneapolis band, that I indeed had the pleasure of playing with on a couple of occasions as an opener on the club scene. I am certain that their togetherness has long since dissapated, but their sound has been preserved here in excellent form, just as they were. Give it up for February!"
4,Great workout!!,My husband I did this workout together! He enjoyed the way it switched up routines so we didn't get too bored! We're happy to have it in our library.
4,Great workout!,"I am very pleased with this dvd. I rarely workout unless I am dieting. And now that I am dieting, I only workout 1-3 times per week. So, I am an amateur. Having said that, this is a great workout dvd! All of the walkers seem sincerely happy and Leslie and the music motivate me to complete the 4-mile walk (takes about 55 minutes) each time. Of course, you can only do 1, 2, or 3 miles, but since day 1, I've always been motivated to walk 4 miles. I am not sure how many calories we burn with this workout but I try to exaggerate the moves to burn a few additional calories. I recommend this dvd for a total body workout. I also use Kickboxing for Dummies. Again, I rarely exercise but the goal is to alternate between this dvd and the kickboxing dvd."
1,The one on the image is not the one i got!,"Last year i bought my first IBM travel mouse, it looks great with my ibm thinkpad (made by lenovo) but with the ibm logo still on it, it matched perfectly my laptop, so i decided to buy 2 more IBM travel mouse for other 2 thinkpads with the IBM logo on them, but what i got was 2 ""Thinkpad"" branded mouses, no more IBM logo on them besides it appeared on the image of the product i choose, too bad, hope next time sellers put the right image on the product before we buy them... i will resell them!"
4,Good portable mouse,"I bought this eight years ago with my first laptop to have something small and easy to pack. The size is great for portability, but is easy to use at the same time. The rubberized surface helps make it easier to hold, but it did soften and wear over time. The only issue I've had was with the scroll wheel...after a few months it started having trouble with fast scrolling. Its been through a lot over the years and still works! Overall, I've been happy with it."
5,Another member of the Cult of the IBM Travel Mouse,"In 2003, I was still getting used to using the trackpoint on my laptop. A colleague took pity on me and lent me his IBM travel mouse. I bought my own the next day, and I've been using it ever since. I think the secret is that it's so small you can easily hold it between your thumb and ring finger, and your index and middle fingers rest on the buttons without thinking - so it takes no adjustment time when you move between the keyboard and mouse. It's incredibly precise for a LED mouse, but the scroll wheel has always been a little wobbly - not a big deal.I'm super-fussy about my mouse and keyboard, and I've tried to find a better mouse many times (the closest potential successor has been a USB Razor Pro Click), but after 8 years in my laptop bag I keep coming back to the increasingly battered little IBM. In fact I only came to this page to make sure they were still selling them!"
5,A book for your child,"A cute book based on the '40s song I Love You. A large book with bright colorful simple pictures that babies in arms can relate to. The pages are hardcover and durable that should last through several children who are taught to care for their books. I purchased the book because this was the song I would sing to my children when they needed cuddling and when rocking them to sleep. I am glad to see the song in book form, and now used as a children's book."
5,Love this book!,"My 2 1/2 year old twins love it when I sing this song to them, so I was thrilled to find a book that illustrated it. The pictures are bright and fun, and it's always nice when the publisher includes the lyrics/music, as it does in this one."
3,Cute Transition,"I've sung this song for my grandchildren for years. When I ever bought the book, the children were delighted. Putting the little duck antics along with the original tune was adorable."
5,Authoritative and detailed,"This is the first time a thorough review of post war Berlin intelligence activities has been published. For the professional this is a good compilation of operations (collection, defection, analysis, etc.). For the novice the book is a difficult read - chock full of details but not written in captivating language. Students of history need to add this to their collection of books to keep and use as reference."
2,you get whta you pay,it is not a durable bike although the frame looks pretty nice. the paddles broke down after just one week and the brakes always had huge noise.I have to return it and buy the other one.I wouldn't not suggest you to buy this item if you really want to USE it but not only LOOK at it. you can find much better ones from other brand.
1,After Testing...,"This knife is a good design, but made of very poor materials. For the price, i'd say perhaps a little over priced. I've been using it for one day, doing some basic shopping and throwing and the handle is lose. i wouldn't buy it again if i had the choice. i give it a one out of five stars. i will never buy something with a kraton handle again."
2,Just fix one problem and make the loyal customer base very happy,"The hilt is a rubber-like material. It easily bends, does not add any functional value and is only for looks. As time goes by, I regret purchasing this knife for that reason alone. It's the first thing others have noticed when I showed it to them, confirming the matter.Understand, I'm a big Cold Steel fan and continue to purchase Cold Steel products. I feel like a spokesperson for the company. Therefore, coming from me the company should consider fixing the problem to produce a truly great product.The blade itself is perfect for a non-carbon edge. The handle less the hilt is also very good. The Japanese design, the tanto, is classic and will never go out of style."
5,Great Knife,"I ordered this knife late thursday night and received it on saturday. This is a great knife, and it came razor sharp out of the box. I already used it to cut down a small tree, which it did easily and in a matter of minutes. The knife did get a little marked up from that tree, but you can only tell the marks are there if your looking for them. The handle is very nice too, my hand wasn't sore at all after chopping. The sheath is also pretty nice. The only bad thing about it is the fact that the knife doesnt really lock into the sheath. The strap on the handle keeps the blade locked in, but if it is unsnapped the knife will stay secured unless it is moved around then it will fall out (if unsnapped you can easily shake the knife out.) As long as its snapped the knife is secure.I give the knife a 5/5 and the sheath a 4/5Overall I really like this knife and I would recommend it to anybody who wants a good survival/tactical knife."
5,Flawless,"I received my knife the day before yesterday. I was very pleased that it arrived before Christmas. The box was kinda damaged but I am not sure if that was the seller's fault or the mails. That didn't really matter because the product itself was received flawless, perfect in every way. It is completely symmetric and it is so sharp that you get cut just by looking at it. The kraton handle allows for a very good grip. The black coat is delicate and it will easily scratch but I expected no less since I read information about the knife before purchasing it. The coat doesn't really matter, it can be coated again. The metal itself is really good and nearly impossible to dent. Good value for the money."
3,Not a Carbon V,"Older Recon Tanto was made from Carbon V and had black epoxy powder coat finish(like dark flat matte finsihed)....Amazon Description is WRONG,it clear said blade is made from CARBON V..but this is AUS8A Newer/Cheaper blade type..........anyway...Amazon price is probably cheapest on internet.but beware this is newer AUS8A blade..."
1,NOT Carbon V as described,The description of the item is not accurate. I was hoping it was made of Carbon V isntead of AUS-8A. One star for gross misrepresentation.
2,They WorK but Don't Fit,"I had something similar on my last vehicle, and they fit and worked great. So when I got the Nissan, I said yep, I need those. Well the curve is not correct for a 2012 Murano and it was listed as fitting. I have pictures to show the curve is not correct."
3,Wishful Leads to Faithful!,"I have loved a number of Buechner's writings because he is not afraid to talk about the very difficult subject of suicide from a personal viewpoint. This little book is not quite so deep! He is writing to the skeptic here, I think. That's OK. Most of us were doubters before we became people of true faith. We need not be afraid of our own questions. This little book is for the person who loves ideas! The book is subtitled, ""A Seeker's ABC."" Here is one of Buechner's clever definitions: ""Envy"" - Envy is the consuming desire to have everybody else as unsuccessful as you are. Pretty good, yes? I recommend this book to anyone who likes to exercise his brain! Be prepared to be confronted with your own weaknesses and your great need to know God."
3,Disappointed!,"I have read other books by Ms. Westhaven and enjoyed them, but was very disappointed by this one. For one thing, I couldn't feel the attraction for the heroine, Theodora Thornfield, a penniless spinster who wanted to be independent by accepting a job as a paid companion to her cousin. This is suppose to be a character with spirit and ideas, but a whimp and stubborn woman instead. I also felt there was a lack of romantic chemistry among the characters.The writing was pretty pleasant at the beginning half, but latter half was petty and tedious, the story line was very slow going, I did a lot skimming to help to push the plot forward.Over all, it was not worth to buy, but perhaps better to check out from library first."
2,Cheap,"This stroller is a big disappointment. While it looks very cute, I have the feeling it is not going to last very long. I just got the stroller in yesterday, and already it is coming apart. The velcro connection from the hood to the back of the seat is already coming off. The seat insert/cover bunches up at the bottom if I don't hold it up while my daughter climbs in. I can't imagine trying to put a six monthold in it, you would need and extra set of hands. All in all I am really dissapointed, especially since it is so very cute and I was thinking of buying a second one for baby number two.I knew I should have bought a Maclaren. So much for saving money."
3,seat cover,"The color is great, the ease of opening and closing is also good however the seat padding is not attached to anything and it slides down with every use.In fact it takes another set of hands to hold the cover in place while the child is placed in the stroller."
5,Super Pleased,I recieved the power supply faster than I expected.Installation was a snap. I have 3 fans 2 hard drives and 2 dvd players installed. There were enough power cables to dedicaite to each component and still have some left over. I have been usinf the product for a couple months now and have had no problems with it.
4,Revealing the True Jesus,This is a fine documentary production which presents many great historical and cultural insights although I was annoyed by some of the modernist (liberal) theological perspectives presented by a few of the commentators.Purchasers of this DVD may also like the Jesus Revealed DVD study series. It uses many of the the same beautifully produced visual dramatization scenes from the Gospels with the addition of the provocative Bible teaching of Andy Frost. This is an excellent tool for anyone wanting to know more about the authentic Jesus.Jesus Revealed: Encountering The Authentic Jesus (Disc 1)Jesus Revealed (Disc 2)
5,The best think a newly wed can read...,This is the first book I read after saying I DO. It has really got me focused on the right things and really learing how to pray for my wife. This was and extreamly great read. This is the wedding gift I will give to all newly weds along with the power of a praying wife..
5,a perfect gift,I highly recomend this book. It is the perfect gift to give to new couples or those married awhile and need a fresh reminder. To those yet married... who says you only pray for your spouse when you're married? It's never too early. A very balanced and practical book for one who desires to saturate their relationship in prayer. Stormie Omartian is a fantastic voice on prayer. I recomend all of her books.
1,A VERY DISAPPOINTING BOOK,"The Power of a Praying Husband is a book with potential that fell short. Far Short. It is written by a woman when it should have been adddressed by a man. The book is overly simple. I get the impression she writes it simple with the idea in mind that ""even us guys can understand the complexities of a women."" As usual a women has sold us short. As a Christian I am very sensitive to my wife's needs. Many christian men communicate with their wife in a far more perceptive environment than this author gives us credit. I belong to a christian mens group that is totally bored with this and I will be surprised if we finish it. I do not recommend this to mature christian men in a mature christian marriage. It would be a waste of time. I do give the author credit for attempting this issue. She failed, but I give her credit for trying."
5,A Must for Men! This book has Enriched Mt Life!,"Wow, I don't know where to begin. I'm in the middle of a marriage crisis as I'm writing this. My wife has left our home and I was needing some answers. This book has taught me how to connect with God and learn about my marriage and my wife as well as the giving me insight into how my wife thinks and functions. The 20 chapters are incredibly informational and easy to read and understand. Guys...you've got to read this book in order to learn how to help your wife and increase your relationship. In the end, if my marriage fails, I will walk away with a wealth of knowledge about how to assure that I'll never get into this predicament in life again."
4,Insightful!,"This book is a great insight to how we, as men, need to be the proper help-mate with our wives. Often we go through stoms and don't know how to respond... USUALLY INCORRECTLY. This book offers some great insights on how to effectivly pray for your wife. One thing that I apprecieate was ""sample prayers"". Sometimes we cannot think of how to pray... we lose sight of His purpose. In the storm we tend to move more towards the selfish and don't seek God's wisdom... This book helps to cover the many dimensions of your wife. Simple to read... easy to understand... a great handbook."
4,Great gift to all husbands out there :-),"When I saw this book in the bookstore, I immediately got curious. Obviously it is not for me but I thought all husbands should have one. I immediately bought a copy each for my husband, brothers,& brothers-in-law.Since I intend to give these copies for Christmas, I have to keep in a safe place where my husband will not accidentally see. I manage to read it once in a while in his absence & as a wife, I think I will benefit from this if he reads it.The question though is if he really will."
1,Terrible!!!!,"The books ""praying wife"" and ""praying husband"" are written by a woman, from a woman's point a view and FOR women. They are both full of all the subtle and not so subtle negative male-bashing stereotypes that many women have of men. I'll spare you the money: the wives are told everything is the husbands fault and they should pray that they change. The husbands are told that it's their fault and they should pray that they change."
5,Simplistic but Effective,"These cards are a must for the husband who wants to pray for his wife, but never seems to feel confident in the contents of his prayers. They are small enough to carry in your workbag, back pack, or leave in your car. I highly recommend for any husband who wants to take his marriage to another level."
5,A therapist's view,I have been a marital therapist for more than 30 years. This book gave me insights into and a pathway toward greater growth in my own marriage. I recommend it to every man [or woman] who seeks the Holy Spirit and the fruits of the spirit in their marriage.
4,Wonderful Words of Wisdom,Wonderful wisdom and insight for all husbands. Who you are in Christ is eternally connected to your relationship with your wife. Pray for her and you will reap the blessings.
2,Maybe I am different,"I must say for a woman to even try to write a book for men, about their relationship with their wives must be very courageous. For that she gets 2 star. I tried with my possible best intention to listen to the book, I just could not reach half of it. I applaud all those men who say it's a great book and rate it 5 stars. I just don't see it that way."
4,Missing performances no more!,"This was an awesome concert, I was there.In order to be fair I'm editing my review and adding that this CD has the performances I longed for only that apparently, I hadn't searched enough (and I'm probably too late but I'd change my rating to 5 stars now I found my song!). ""California"" was indeed included with more songs that were sort of like the ""deleted scenes"".Draco is one of those odd creatures that can convey so much with two words, a sigh, a whisper, a look or just a head tilt. Imagine what he can do with a song, let alone a concert full of them!You can't imagine it. He's that good. He's a thousand steps ahead of you and you're glad, because you know he's going to write a song about it.If you haven't heard of him before he's like a mix between the Smashing Pumpkins during ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"", Nirvana and The Counting Crows.This CD/DVD combo is amazing, just get it."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this book to learn more about Lucrezia Borgia. It was really, really dry reading that sidelined Lucrezia and told more about her family. While interesting, it just wasn't what I was looking for."
3,cool boarders 2k1,"This is a pretty cool game, has much of the feel from cool boarders 2, that people seemed to like more than in 4, also now the game plays like tony hawk, where you beat levels to unlock more player and events, fun to play but i think you must be a fan of the series or really like snowboarding because tony hawk pro skater 2 sets the trend as far as extreme sports goes!"
2,Cool Boarders 4 is better by far,This game is confusing and lacks a lot of the course options of the previous versions. The play control seems very weak. I'm confused by the courses.
4,Shampoo,I have very long older hair (I'm in my early 60's) It's thick but since I don't color it it is somewhat wiry. It's hard to tell ifit's helping as I also use the conditioner which I love. It smells nice and doesn't seem to be drying it out.
3,Played with this filter recently,"I am hesitant to say how well this filter works because I played with it in some pretty unfavorable light conditions though my flash fired just fine.I also experimented with a larger aperture and the effect of the lens was more visible to my eye than under the flash conditions. Though I intend to experiment with the lens more, I am, at this point wondering if I should have purchased #2 or #3 of this filter family.I used this filter with a client (Nov 08) who believed they were not photogenic and whose face wears a troubled life and age. In the afternoon of bright sun and shade this lens performed admirably softening visible years and reducing Photoshop time! The outcome with the client was not one but three poses being printed for purchase."
5,Like the combination,"New camera, need new filters. I like the combination of the color warming and the edge softening effects into one filter, I am rather pleased with this filter."
3,Reich Underground,The are some gnawing gaps in the historical time-line. Needs re-editing and a newer version should be released. Publisher should convoke a new set of witnesses and military historians to take this program to a new completion.
3,"Somewhat interesting, but also dull","This Brit documentary manages to make a fascinating subject - the Nazi underground industrial infrastructure - a tad dull. We see a lot of footage of old tunnels and mine shafts and the like, overlaid with WWII footage of some of the same structures, not enough. I came away a little antsy."
1,What he said,I searched for something good to say about this.1. The photography is professional. Those who did the actual photography the film knew their trade. Not outstanding but good.2. The black and white footage from the WW2 era brought back memories.3. It's fairly short. (But the memories linger on to haunt your sleep)Good contender for the worst attempt at movie making in the last 20 years.
1,Spoils of War,"The horror......the horror.......seriously the worst WWII movie I've ever seen, and I've seen lots. Just the laughable technical inaccuracies are breathtakingly bad. An M14 rifle? Really? Run from this turd, it's stinking up the place."
2,"Ok, not loud though","Not that I was expecting it to be loud, but this thing is pretty quiet. Mounted it under the hood of the truck for a PA. Works fine, and is ok volume with the truck hood up, but once its closed is very muffled. Not a bad product, but will probably buy a louder one"
5,Most beautiful ever,"Everything on this disc is thrilling and wonderful - especially ""Panis Angelicus"" - the most beautiful version of this sacred song I have ever heard in the whole of my life"
5,Amazing recording,"Really enjoyed this CD. Definitely worth listening to this great talent. If you are looking for an example of a dramatic soprano, you can't beat Birgit Nilsson."
3,"decent, but not great",The bag is a LOT bigger than it appears and for all it's bulk it doesn't hold stuff all that well. The big drawback is that the sleeve that holds the computer is not well secured and you have to be careful when picking up the bag that it's upright or your laptop could go flying (like mine did).
3,BE CAREFUL WHO IT SHIPS FROM - PROPHOTOBAGS :(,"The bag itself it great and I love Lowepro - however The company I bought it through on Amazon was prophotobags. The bag I ordered was a little too big and I wanted to exchange it for the smaller version, which is impossible.DO NOT ORDER from this company (prophotobags) if you are not absolutely positive it is the item that you want! Horrible return policy. I ordered a bag for $30 that was too big and wanted to exchange it. To do the exchange I would have to pay a $20 restocking fee and the cost of shipping - that is more than the bag cost me!!!!! On their return policy page they do mention having to pay for the shipping but never did they mention a restocking fee."
1,not worth the box it came in,stethoscope is usless----you should not offer it for sale----i am very disapointed in this product and as a new customer i have
2,can't hear anything,We bought these with the intention of using them until we could afford some higher end ones but it is not worth it. My wife says she can't hear anything out of them and that she has to borrow her co-workers ones some times because it is that bad. It barely works for what she needs it for and we are going to have to buy new ones. This time we are just going to fork out the money for some nicer ones. I would not recommend these to anyone other than children playing doctor.
5,Fine Item,No issues. I didn't need to use it for medical purposes. It was part of a Halloween costume. Served its purpose.
3,Wrong Color,"Equiptment works fine, but is not the color given in the description - which was my reason for buying the item. It said the color would be Frosted Glacier, but was a clear tube instead."
3,Sound quality is not good,I bought this prestige lite model and a friend bought a cheaper prestige model. Strangely the sound quality is better on the cheaper model.
1,disappointed,This worked great for the first few months.. Now I can't hear anything and have to purchase a new stethoscope
2,Can't really hear much...,"Unless the room is quite and you really press down, you can't hear much through these. Overall not worth it, find a better product. Certainly don't use this as a required medical device; I was just using it to casually check blood pressure for personal reasons."
5,Spanish-English Dictionary,"This year I've become fast friends with a woman from Venezuala. She has this book and that is how I know how great it is. Since she has only been in this country almost one year, it has been invaluable to her, and me as well.We have used this book numerous times to translate the entire gamut of topics, words, items and meanings. And we've had a hilarious time as well. Such as when she needed to understand the difference between; 'snicker,' and 'sneaker,' 'boxes' and 'bucks,' (which she initially thought sounded the same!) Of course the killer of them all was when she ordered a 'coc,' not and not a 'Coke,' in our local Applebee's!Now I'll be able to have my own copy for when we are on the telephone, and to help be better understand what she and her relations are talking about when they are speaking Spanish!I truly hope that I'll continue to pick up the Spanish language as quickly as she has done, with the help of this book. Thank you, Pat"
5,MONSTROUS!!,"If you dig songwriting with punch and great playing, get this record. Its hard to believe it's their first album. Aside from gems like Everything, Christine, and Rainstorm, this CD is mercifully free of filler--the songs are consistently first-rate. Recommended."
5,This CD Rocks!!! I love you guys,I think you guys are so good!!! Mr. McDaniel it's me Kathleen!! Your band is so cool! I love the song Monster in my stomach!
5,"One of the best ""underground"" bands I've heard of",I first heard Nine Men's Morris at my school because the band members (or at least one of them) are faculty at my school. I loved every song and every word of it. This band is great.
4,fisher price power wheels,"The batteries work well, I had to change the connector because we have a different connector on our car. Voided the warranty damn the luck:). The shipping was free and the battery cost each $10 dollars less than what I could get locally."
1,Not the right battery for the Harley,"This is not the right battery for the Harley motorcycle it is being sold with. So now I'm stuck with a battery I can't return, and my MIL is out the $35 she paid because Amazon cross-promoted it."
4,Great product,"Nice product and worth the price. Got pretty much what was requested, and shipped very timely. Would have no problem purchasing from this vendor again."
3,Power Wheels battery,Recieved wrong battery for my kids powerwheels and could not return. Brand new in box and now need to reorder the correct battery. Out $30.00.
3,Wrong battery,Be sure to check out to make sure you are orderingthe correct battery. THIS ONE WAS NOT WHat I neededand it could NOT BE RETURNED. THe red one is just ascheap at WAl Mart and the competition.Won't order again on line when it cannot be returned
4,"Good stuff, but concerned about instructions","It says you need to charge at least 18 hours before you can use it.When I plugged it into charger it said like it is charged already, same effect with second battery.Strange...As well I cant understand why it says you need to charge before every new drive,it should contain memory and based on its ni nature it is better to uncharge 100% before starting new charge at least 3 times."
4,Perfect Power for Power Wheels,I purchased a replacement battery for our granddaughter's Power Wheels 4 wheeler. The battery was a perfect match as promised and our granddaughter loves it. She back on the road (not literally)again.
4,Who doesn't love PowerWheels!?!,"Bought a Barbie Power Wheels 4-wheeler at a garage sale for my daughter. All it needed was a new battery. Works great now and tons of fun! Really best suited for a 5-year old or older, and don't forget the Helmet!"
1,Wrong,"Even though it was sold with a particular product as an extra battery, it isn't, and it doesn't fit into that product. Conveniently, it's not returnable either."
3,works a bit but has lower voltage,"works a bit but has lower voltage then 6 V, it's less then 4 volts after charging for over 18 hrs as indicated. I can see some stickers were pulled off of it compared to the one I already had. I don't know how ""new"" this battery really is/was."
1,Boo,I Wish I could return it for a different battery so my son can ride his little four wheeler sometime this year.
5,Works great!,"This product is one of many great products I have received from Amazon! It was exactly what I needed, worked just as guaranteed, and shipped to my home in 4 days!"
3,Battery review,"Not fair to rate this battery for fun or education but vital to operation of battery powered cars. Main value is price when compared to same item sold in stores, 50% savings!!!"
1,Do not buy this battery.....false information.,This battery does not have an H style connector as described. I don't understand how amazon is allowing this product to have incorrect information and not allow returns.
3,Check for Product Recalls,"Let me first state, the picture for this product is the newer fixed battery, which was replaced for certain power wheels based on a lawsuit in which a child was severely burned.My warning is to make sure your old power wheels are not using the older batteries. the new battery as pictured has a thick black battery connector, the old ones where white and much smaller.In my case, the barbie power wheels were recalled some time ago. A neighbor gave me their child's old one, whose batteries were from 1995. I took the 1995 batteries to a local authorized dealer, and he immediately said you will need to exchange the batteries and charger due to a recall.Long story short, you are buying the newer, fixed batteries, which may not fit your old charger. If this is the case, I suggest you find an authorized dealer and have them replaced (batteries are not replaced for free)"
4,good stuff not great,"fully charged lasted 30 minutes on grass. expected more. not sure why the technology isn't there for lithium battery. the worst is the care instructions. you have to charge it immediately after use, then immediately before use then once a month even when not in use. if not battery dies. you also cannot run battery all the way down or battery dies. if you don't have a quick charger your talking 14 hours at a clip. talk about annoying. the batteries do work as advertised and would recommend the quick charger."
1,Not As described!!!!,Like other people that bought the batteries....It was not the same battery and I am out 73.00!! There is no way to return it and I hope anyone else thinks twice before they buy off of here. You are better off paying the little bit extra to get what you need.
1,wrong battery,The battery I needed and the picture that was shown next to it at the time was the wrong one.Now i can't find the one I need.
1,Not Needed,"The battery that was recommended was not needed. Besides, there was a shipping cost, so it was pointless to send it back. The 12 volt battery that is in the very cute car is weak, and at this time, we have not been able to find a replacement. If you buy the Corvette, do not buy the 6 volt battery."
1,This book is terrible!,"This book is not worth a dime. It appears as if it was not edited! Some of the answers are wrong (particularly noticable in the math section). Many of the page numbers referring to another section are wrong. Although it's somewhat useful in determining what to study, this book is not a reliable source from which to study for this important test. Get a different book! Perhaps future editions will improve..."
2,buy another book,"I bought this book a month and a half ago, and I've been studying with it every day. Well, I took the MSAT this past Saturday and I realized that this book hardly helped me at all. The practice questions in the book do not even vaguely resemble the ones on the test. I probably failed the MSAT which I paid $220 for. Take my advice, buy another help book."
2,Think carefully before you buy,"Let me say that this is the cheapest of the MSAT books. And you get what you pay for.ALthough this book helped me understand the structure of each component of the test, it did not provide any additional help in terms of content.There are so many errors in this book, it makes me envious of the author and the publisher who just republish this book every so often.Why they don't find someone to professionally clean up the book is beyond me. I am sure the author is laughing all the way to the bank.I would have given this book 1 star but it does provide a practice test with answers (suggested responses on essays).Finally, just be prepared to be overwhelmed at the MSAT if you use only this book to study."
2,"Poorly edited and constructed ""reference"" book","There are multiple instances of unreliable information in this book. These instances are prevalent throughout the book in each subject area. Although an intelligent person can use the general outline provided as a guide, a weaker student could be more easily misled, resulting in misinformation.This book could do more damage than good if used as your only source material.Examples: Upton Sinclair wrote ""The Jungle,"" not Sinclair Lewis. The far side of the moon was photographed 10 years earlier than this book suggests. The ""Treaty of Paris"" occurs twice in this book ,in different decades and with different definitions, requiring further study to see which one (if any) was correct.I have yet to sit the test yet so there is no element of ""sour grapes."""
2,Buy another book to prepare for the MSAT,"I took the MSAT this past September, and missed the essay portion by 3 points! So, I'm taking it again this Saturday.I used this book to study for the MSAT the first time around and overall it is just okay. There are errors here and there and although they included 2 sample exams, they do not even go over the answer for the essays. Instead, they tell you to take it to a teacher to grade! Which I think is lame - like you have time to do that. You get what you pay for.""The Best Test Preparation for the MSAT"" by the Research & Education Association is much more thorough and seems very accurate. This book was recommended by university professors. I'm using it as I write this..."
1,Buy something else...,"I am a fairly bright, soon to be, graduate student and I just failed the MSAT because I used only THIS study guide to prepare... not only are there TONS of mistakes... the practice tests in this book do not even come CLOSE to what the real test is like... I was blown away by how hard it is... buy something else to study if you want to pass..."
5,Was so excited!!,"We had bought the rinse ace in order to bathe our dogs. We had to replace our showerhead and without thinking got rid of the original valve. I looked everywhere around here for months and could not find a replacement. When I saw this, I was so excited that we could use the hose again! There is nothing like bathing a 100lb dog and using a pitcher to rinse him off!! I am so happy that I found this on Amazon!"
4,Very Nice Puzzle but missing one piece.,"Very nice puzzle. As other reviews said, the birds were fun & easy to put together but the rest was not as easy. It was fun to do. I was very disappointed however because it was missing one piece."
2,Missing pieces,"I was so excited about this puzzle as I was going to frame it and put it on my mantle for Christmas. It was sold as new, unopened. When I finished the puzzle, there were 3 pieces missing. As I work puzzles all the time, I always put a sheet under my cardtable so that I can see any missing pieces. I wrote the seller and had no response. Needless to say, the puzzle was worthless.Thank you,Jean"
3,missing pieces,"This is a pretty puzzle and not too difficult, however, mine was missing a few pieces. Kind of frustrating when I had planned on displaying the puzzle."
4,alt-big-band-space-elf could be new genre?,"Bjork has unleashed her trademark accent and unearthly wail on the genre of Big Band music. With her coquettish, elf-like charm, and futuristic Icelandic pop sensibilities she has put her own spin on what could well be a Broadway showstopper. Beginning as a delicate, slow, breathy whisper and climaxing in an all-out, swining joyful shriek, Bjork masterfully plays with tempos and dynamics. The only problem is that it really comes close to overindulgence. John Altman's arrangements are sophisticated enough, thankfully, to keep it all real. Overall a wonderful interpretation on this 1948 Betty Hutton track that shows us why swing music can be so much fun. The inclusion of the Icelandic mix of ""You've Been Flirting Again"" is just icing on this already rich cake."
5,SUPER PRODUCT,I found this product years ago at a gun show and fell in love with it. I never buy ice any more for our camping trips. I bought several for our daughter to have when camping. What a great invention! It works better than ice when you put inbetween your food as well as along the walls of your cooler.
3,Disappointed in results.,I am disappointed in Techni Ice. All of the pods do not contain the freezing product and will not swell up with water to freeze. I have given them a week to fill up and they haven't. You can feel with your fingers that some of the pods are empty. I don't know how this will affect the useage.I have had these sheets before and they were wonderful. But they do wear out and I needed new ones. All of the pods in the older sheets I had were filled up and froze well. They were the 2-ply.Techni Ice HDR 4 Ply Reusable Ice Packs / Hot Packs (2 Sheets)
4,These are nice,"We use these for my son's lunch bag at school. To keep his milk cold all day, using the big block frozen packs was very heavy and took up a lot of room. I like that you can cut these to the perfect size. I don't find that they really freeze harder than other packs, but they are more convenient to use due to being able to modify them to suit particular needs."
4,Pleased,This was my first experience with Techni-Ice. I was pleasantly surprised at how effective it is.
5,"Classic ""Nun""","It's a shame that CTN did not put out more wonderful synth music after the success they had in 1989 and 1990. She's a Secretary is one of their best songs and the remixes, including the full 12-inch version of Will You Be There, are off the charts. If you like Depeche Mode, Camouflage, or just a fan of the 80's and synth-pop then this cd is for you. Trust me, you will not be disapointed!"
2,Outdated Information,"This is a bad time for English majors, says one of my professors. Most corporate communication departments have been combined with either marketing or sales or newsletters have been dumped on overworked managers. Book publishers are scaling back in order to not go bankrupt. Newspapers are laying of employees with decades of experience. They usually turn to freelance editing and writing, saturating that market.There are still jobs and ways for word lovers to make money. But since this book was written in 1996 there are no references to how to make money online. Most of the jobs listed would have been great suggestions for the mid-nineties but times have changed too much for this industry. The things listed are too obvious and too saturated.The most helpful guidance book I've found on this subject so far wasI'm an English Major Now What?."
4,great single,"A great single, showing a more tender, reflective side of Erasure's music and lyrics. For my money, the b-side Omni Remix of ""True Love Wars"" alone is worth the price of the import. Slammin' hard techno."
2,The B-side is worth the price,"Although I am a HUGE Erasure fan, I thought that this single was a little weak. The best track on this cd is the b-side ""True Love Wars"", a very catchy tune that reminds me alot of their work on the I say I say I say album. It is wonderful in every sense of the word, and after hearing it, you will be humming it all day long. The ""Stay with me"" mixes are okay at best, but I prefer Erasure when they are more upbeat and happy, rather than melancholy."
3,"OK, but part 2 is better","Part 1 is CDMUTE174, which includes Stay with Me and True Love Wars. Stay With Me is a nice song, and the ""basic mix"" is just that, a bit of an extension on the original. True Love Wars is basically the intro to Erasure's Self-Titled (I Guess I'm into Feeling) but extended into song-length. While it's a good tune, you'll feel a bit cheated if you already own Self-Titled. Then there's the Omni mix which is an ambient version by Thomas Fehlmann, but it's a bit *too* ambient and you can barely even hear the original tune in there.Part 2 - LCDMUTE174 (the mixes) is better, containing the Flow mix, NY mix, Guitar Mix, and Castaway Dub. Get it if you can, although it's probably out of print."
4,Good But Not Perfect,This Is one of My favorite spray nozzles Its heavy for some reason It reminds Me of something that rich people would use. It will adjust to a heavy mist but the jet stream Is a little too wide for Intense cleaning also the pin kept falling back holding It open I just took the pin off. Also It will Not shut off with extreme high Water pressure unless You shut the Water off to It first a simple solution Is to use a brass shut off valve.
4,sturdy and well-built,"This nozzle is sturdy and well-built and has a powerfull stream. The downside is that, if you are watering a specific plant, it's hard to target the stream properly. It's either too narrow and powerful or too broad and weak. But it works well if you are watering an entire garden or lawn area."
3,Filmed in Grain-o-vision,"Some of the shots were clear but then they would switch to another camera and it would be grainy again! Hard on the eyes.Super fans will want this for the historic value, others might want to get ""Watch me Jumpstart"" instead. Watch them both in a row and see Bob age 20 years in the space of 10 actual years!Shows you what too much booze will do, not a pretty sight."
2,Embarassing,"I was introduced to Guided By Voices recently, and quickly became obsessed. I don't totally regret buying this film, because the first 30 minutes are pretty solid, and the sound mixing is at least acceptable. But it all goes downhill from there. Not only do Bob and the band become more and more wasted as the four hour concert goes on, but whoever's running the mixing board seems to go the same way. And it's horribly filmed. You're one of the most prolifically creative bands that ever lived, and you couldn't find a decent film crew in Chicago for your farewell show? It's like these guys hadn't held cameras before. Drinking is part of the GBV culture, and yes my jacket still reeks of stale beer from the Bob Pollard show i saw last month, but that's no excuse for this awful production. For die-hards only."
1,grand finale ??????????????????????,"what a sad ending to robert pollards ever revolving band, this again is only for the diehards who want every single piece of merchandise that gbv has to offer, i jumped on the bandwagon with the release of ''propeller''way back when, but jumped off after the horrid ''isolation drills'' this dvd contains many good songs but they are just horribly played and bob's singing was disgusting, not a proper way to go out if you ask me but again, the material they were releasing near their end was bland and uninspiring"
3,"Great performance, great show, poor production","I was so happy to see that GBV would finally release a properly documented, full-length live DVD. I'm pretty disappointed. Austin City Limits or even their appearance on HBO's Reverb is way better. This DVD is full of nostalgia and fun to watch, but honestly...the picture quality looks like it was shot with a poor camera that couldn't cope with the club lighting and the sound is really poor for a professional release. While the sound is sourced from the board, the mix is so bad it sounds like the soundman was as drunk as Bob. You can barely tell the guitar parts apart. I don't regret buying it, but I guess I'll have to dig out the old VHS tapes to see a better GBV show with professional audio."
3,What do you expect from a lo-fi band?,"I really really really wish this DVD had great sound. There's four hours of music on here, and it would have been great to be able to have a nice mix. I'd care less about the visuals if the music had been recorded properly. However, it is what it is, and it is nice to have a record of GBV's sloppy finale."
1,Terrible acvice,Only buy this tape if you have cash to burn. It's just one more piece of junk to be thrown away.
4,Pretty pearls for a good price,"These ""big"" pearl studs arrived quickly, in time for me to wear to a wedding. I am no expert, but they are very pretty. One of the posts was bent just a tiny bit, but not enough for me to bother with a return. I do like the fact that these pearls are not perfectly spherical, as they sit nicely on my earlobes."
3,You get what you pay for....,"These would have been good except one of the earrings, the clasp failed (wouldn'nt stay on, the groove wasn't correctly made). They weren't as nice as I'd hoped but then again, you do get what you pay for."
5,Beautiful and a Great Bargain for the Price,"I received these earrings yesterday (7/15/11) and immediately put them on. They are a little bigger than I am used to, but they are simply gorgeous. I only noticed on teeny tiny flaw (they earrings came out of their position in the box en route, so I suspect the earring was nicked while inside the box). Otherwise, a great buy for the price."
4,"Pretty, but be careful",The size is perfect for everyday wear. I wore these half a dozen times and then lost one of the pearls; fortunately it was indoors and I found the missing pearl so I was able to glue it back on the post.
4,Great Looking!!,"Arrived very quickly, earlier than expected. They look great - lustrousand shiny. Nice finish. Look great with casual or dressy clothing. Sizeis good, but was expecting a button type (flatter) rather than a stud type(round) earring. Wearing them anyway."
4,Nice size.,"Nice size pearl and color for the prices. I would have given these 5 stars except the posts are pretty flemsey. They have already bent. I can fix the post, but have to be careful not to damage the earring since they are delicate. Recommend the seller uses better posts to make this a solid investment. These are great for someone who wants an inexpensive, authentic basic pearl earrring."
4,Beautiful Earrings,"I purchased these, as Christmas gifts for my two grandnieces. Since I did not have much money to spend on gifts, I searched many different online stories to get the best deal. I purchased pearl earrings from a different online store and ended up sending them back. These are very beautiful, no marks on the pearls as the other ones had. The girls are going to love them."
2,Not the same size,"Bought these earrings but they were different sizes and unacceptable as gifts. Also, as best as I can tell there is no such thing as a quadruple A rating for pearls. Would not buy again and shame on Amazon for serving this to its customers."
1,Definitely Disappointed,"I just got these in the mail today and I'm sad to say that they're pretty scratched up. It's not like I got out a magnifying glass, it was at first glance that these looked pretty banged up. I wish they would have come in better condition so that I could say that these were worth the money I spent, but they just weren't. The $5 crappy ones from Wal-Mart look better than these do.Also majorly bummed that everyone else who left a review seemed to have a great experience and I didn't :("
3,It's just ok. You get what you pay for.,"I bought this as a present and noticed there were inclusions on both pearls. Not noticeable unless you're six inches away looking for defects. Also, one was slightly smaller than the other... You get what you pay for?"
5,"Wonderful, exactly what I wanted!","I ordered these for a wedding that I was in, and I was pleasantly surprised with my transaction. Not only were they shipped extremely fast, but they were packaged in a delightful pretty little box. And the earrings are great! In fact, I'm wearing them right now. I saw that other reviewers commented on the back slipping off, but I haven't experienced that yet. All in all, a great buy!"
1,English Pattern Practices (Intensive Course In English),English pattern practice are given in this book . But that not enough help to get knowledge faster and the patterns are go one to another very slowly
4,GOOD BUT BIASED STORY OF CLINT EASTWOOD'S LIFE,"If you are a big Clint Eastwood fan like me this is a great DVD about his life to date. However, it is very biased in favor of him. It says nothing negative about how he has been married so many times people have lost count. It does not talk much about the issues with Sandra Locke that she brought up in her book. It is a good buy for anyone who wants to know more about him."
2,Disappointingly inaccurate,"I was amazed to find out that my best friend and I were a terribly match! My boyfriend and I were rated ""Worst:marriage""! The birthday book was by far the best and most accurate. I think the reason some people find this book more accurate than others is that the authors judge relationships not on the exact birthday but each birthday period is split into groups (i.e. Dec 1-7.)So, like astrology, it works for some and not others."
5,One of the best astrology books for non astrologers,"This text is remarkable. If I had to swear by any astrological information I would bank that this text has already done the work for you and you need only reference a birthday to find and understand your relationships with a significant other, a family member, or even a co-worker. I have compared the information in this text to charts that I have created and found the ""whys"" to why his information holds some credibility and I can say with confidence that if you are wanting to understand someone or if you're dating, reference this material first and make your decision from there. You don't need to be an astrologer to understand how it is written and it may save you some time away from heartache in your relationships."
1,NEVER GOT MY BOOK!!!!,"After waiting and waiting it has been well over a month and still, I have yet to receive my book! It is EXTREMELY frustrating!"
4,Enjoyable,"This book is definitely something different than what I normally read, but really had a lot of interesting insights on relationships of all kinds. I definitely recommend it for others who can maybe gain more understanding of their relationships in life, whether past or present!"
3,Interesting but not sure if information is valid,"The book is definitely interesting and some of it is accurate but I found that more times than not I was dissapointed with the description of relationships as I read this book to myself and to several friends, a lot of the time it didn't necessarily make sense with how I or we view the relationship and I (we) didn't agree with what was said. I do however continue to refer to this book and I really enjoyed reading about my week and how it matched up to other signs (even when I don't have relationships with anyone in the other signs) it would still explain behavior patterns of myself which I found to be fascinating. I do plan on purchasing two other books by the same author."
2,Okay,"Interesting book, but more often than not the paragraph descriptions on relationships are pessimistic. With an understanding that relationships are complex it would have been good to balance the summaries with the possible positive aspects should a relationship succeed. Theoretically more muddled than the previous books. Not very uplifting but interesting. Good conversation book."
2,Too negative about too many relationships.....,"I was very disappointed with this book. I am very open to many forms of spirituality, spiritualism, and mysticism, and I thought that this book would at least give me food for thought about relationships in general and about the specific relationships in my life.Unfortunately, I did not resonate with the descriptions in the book. I think the main reason is that the prognosis was almost always negative. I know that all relationships are a complex mixture of positive and difficult elements. However, most relationships are not mostly bad. Furthermore, I do not want to dwell, almost exclusively, on the reasons that relationships won't work. I would rather know about how to make them better.I see that most people have enjoyed this book. I wish that I did."
2,Wrong,"I read the Secret Language of Birthdays, and thought it was totally on. With this book, I felt the success rate was around 30%. Peruse it in your local bookstore before indulging!"
5,very interesting,"this is the 3rd book I have from this author, friends, family are astonished by how accurately the writings are when comparing to our own real life relationships, I have ordered several copies to give as gifts so I can have mine back"
4,Review,The purchase was good however I expected more from the book but than again I just resently started reading these kinds of books
5,Just Beautiful,This was a great purchase. I have bought about several Coltrane disc but this set trumps everything. The sound is just beautiful. The booklet is great. Bottom Line this is great.If there is something better out there please let me know. I may have a heart attack if someone can tell me where I can find a better set than this!It is truely worth the money.
4,Absolutely agree with Salman Rushdie,"I chose 4 star rating, because I honestly agree with Rushdie's opinion of the book: ""..Gemini is about a pair of identical twins, collectively known as Jean-Paul. Saying this, however, is a bit like saying that Ulysses is about man walking around Dublin.."" What I mean is that this piece of writing has so many levels and layers, that one could hardly say that it's about just relations between Jean and Paul. Most of the book is dedicated to stating different theories about weather, history, psychology, human relations and so on and on.And at some point it might get a bit tiresome, becaouse even though it's interesting I'd say that there is a bit too much of extra information not directly related to the main plot.In general I liked the book, but I could not say that I loved it."
3,Ok But NOT a Bryant Filter,"This filter fits the Bryant filter mount fine (with the included self-adhesive foam strip), but despite the misleading words in the Amazon ad, it is an aftermarket filter, not a Bryant (and also not a Carrier) filter. The filter seems to work okay, but it is not the same quality as the OEM Bryant filer. As long as you understand this, it's an okay buy."
4,"It is a controller, not a game!!","I bought this for my son for Christmas. By the review, I thought it was a game for younger children.Also there was no picture of it, and still isn't. It is a very nice controller. And there is also a bonus memory card included. I think it is a very nice controller for the money and memory cards are expensive, so that is reason enough to buy it.I plan on getting another one soon to keep on hand."
4,Very nice,This controler's best feature is how you can use both sticks even when in digital mode. This lets you play one-handed.
4,good game,The game is good however it gets old pretty fast. I recomend this game for smaller childern.
5,Great book and beautiful illustrations!,This book is a wonderful story and the illustrations were absolutely beautiful! The artist really captured the feeling of the story. I highly for young and old!
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed to see how skinny these blocks were. I didn't read the description close enough on the measurements. I was just going on the pictures and they seemed thicker. I got them for my 2 year old grandson and he gets frustrated with trying to stack them because they are so skinny and fall over so easily.
5,One of the Best from L'Amour,After Bendigo Shafter and Sacket's storys I like Kilkenny's storys best.Recommend to all L'Amour fans
5,The Best of Western Fiction,"I really enjoyed this book, but, in reality love everything L'Amour has written. One caveat, this is a trilogy and this volume is really part 3. L'Amour's website has them stacked backwards. Be sure to read this one as the final Kilkenny installment. Other than that, great action, a bit of a love story and pure Louis L'Amour.."
3,Review,"I like the shoes, but they are a little tight in the toe area and they are a little flat on the bottom. So basically if you have a wide foot or have high arches, you might want to consider a different shoe."
2,"Good non-slip, ouch blisters","BLISTERS!! ouch!! Also my feet were sweaty, as there is no way to wear socks practically. I've had to wear band aids on my heels for the first two weeks. They are great in the non-slip department."
3,Looks good. Awesome sole!! Shoe itself stretches more than expected.,"Bought a pair similar to these a few years ago and loved them. New pair has slip resistant soles that work really well for working in a busy restaurant. Stetched more than I thought, so my feet slide around a lot. Next time I will order half size smaller."
2,SKECHERS SLIP RESISTANCE,"I bought my skechers for work, because in my professionyou need to wear slip resistant, comfortable closed-in shoes. In the detaileddescription they were advertised to be slip resistance. However, onthe first day of wearing them I stepped outside on a very wet footstep(as it was raining) and what do know my foot slipped and I would havehad a very bad fall if my husband had not been there to catch me. Iwas very disappointed to say the least. For appearance I would givethem five stars, but for everything else one and a half stars. It was alsovery expensive.Skechers for Work Women's Hobbie Mary Jane"
3,Ok shoes,"I ordered these as I was a personal care assistant and figured they would be cooler than tennis shoes with my scrubs. They are ok. I recomend buying a size smaller than you wear as they are actually a size to big. Have not wore them alot, but are an ok buy."
1,Not happy,The worst pair of shoes I have ever purchased. The size is incorrect. It's extremely big for a size 7.5 plus the 'sizing info' is incorrect. Will never buy from this buyer again. Not happy.
2,Pretty good but...,"Fans of Baker's string-saturated arrangements will like the tracks here that originally appeared on the 'Fifty Italian Strings' collection. However, these tracks are not remastered and have very limited sound (e.g., Chet's vocals are only audible from one speaker)."
2,extremely realistic,i recently saw this...this is by far a very disgusting and extremely realistic..not for the weak at heart.....this is for those who can take it..i cant something like this..this very sleazy graphic beyond belief..viewer discretion is advised
4,Short and sweet,I read this book when the 2nd edition was published in 1995 and helped me make a significant improvement in my report writing skills. Its not a very long book so I was able to learn the keys skills quickly which enabled me to apply them quickly. I recommend the book to Engineers in my office who need to improve their technical writing skills. I'm glad its still available because we need more copies for my office.
4,poor Tara King,"I must say, I'm a big fan of the Avengers and Mrs. Peel rocks!! I'm a fan not only of Mrs. Peel but also of Diana Rigg. The show includes everything I like and when I saw the last episode with Mrs. Peel (the forget-me-knot) I shed a few tears, especially because Tara King was rather dull introduced in this episode and I thought: my goddness, that's Mrs. Peels replacement? But I was curious about these episodes and the more I saw the more I liked it! Alltogether I must say, that the Tara King episodes lack a little bit the fantasy and the crazy ideas from the Peel-era, but from the character, you can't compare those two women. Each of them has their virtues. Mrs. Peel is intelligent, brave, a fighter and very self-confident. Nothing could touch her! Tara is also a good fighter, funny, heartily and she worships Steed. It's a bit sad, that Tara King is talked down. Linda Thorson did a very good job, she made the Avengers a bit more human!"
2,Disappointment,"What would have been a good deal, price was right and packaging was like new, wasn't a great deal afterall because one of the disc has skips and stalls. If it sounds too good to be true.."
3,not durable enough,"I have a retriever hound mix about 7months old. The bed did ok for the first 3weeks till it got chewed on. The edges were stuffed and are now flat from my dog chewing on it. Will do good with pets who dont bite their bedding, not so good for those who do."
3,A book for high school students only,"The book in general is good, but for chemistry students I would not recommend. It is weak, and has some mistakes."
5,kath and kim,"The seller got back to me straight away with some questions I had regarding delivery, they were prompt with their response and I appreciated that alot. The DVD was great, no complaints what so ever, it was great to watch the real kath and kim, very funny, it never gets old."
3,"Mediocre, author had limited insight, focused on buttons not personalities","Bought it because Amazon kept recommending it and I usually like business stories. Story was disappointing. Mr. Jackson was not high level enough to have great insights. The interesting personalities at PayPal such as Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, etc., which should have been the focus of the story, received less pages than placement of various buttons in the ""fight"" with eBay. The author found out about the PayPal merger after it was announced so missed that key story as well. Overall quite disappointing."
4,Feminist guy at Forex.com screwed up Paypal for 500 million people,and all the feminist gossips on w 74th....Wow you went to harvard to learn to be a whiney feminist gossip .Oh and Arnsten at 11w wont let anyone on the block have RCN or should I say Prince Arnsten in the Holy Jewish Empire
3,sadly lacking in technical depth,"Roughly an average book in the genre ""histories of successful startups told by insiders""; I would rate it higher if it had more technical depth, but unfortunately the author's viewpoint is entirely focused on the marketing side of things. The quality of the writing is uneven, and the book's organization is not ideal; in particular, the prose is far too ""breathless"" -- every single event of any significance (and quite a few that prove to mean zilch) is played up as super-important, making it quite hard to ascertain what really DID matter, and what did not."
3,An alternate history...,"In an article on the [...] blog by Nick Denton called ""An alternate history according to Elon Musk"" Elon is quoted as saying the following about this book:""The only negativity in recent years was due to a book called The PayPal Wars, written by a sycophantic jackass called Eric Jackson. This guy was one notch above an intern at PayPal in the first few years of the company, but gives the impression he was a key player and privy to all the high level discussions. Eric couldn't find a real publisher, so Peter funded Eric to self-publish the book. Since Eric worships Peter, the outcome was obvious - Peter sounds like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and my role is somewhere between negligible and a bad seed. However, to his credit, Peter didn't realize the book would be as bad as it was and apologized to me personally at a Room 9 board meeting at David Sacks's home in LA.""See this link for the full article:[...]"
5,Excellent read,"Highly recommend this book. Not big on writing reviews, but this book was a page turner :)"
3,disappointing,"The book was easy to read, and I found some chapters inspiring. Unfortunately, the book does little to support the author's credibility.It's common these days for a techie with no finance background to understand IPOs and market valuations. Throughout the book, the author points out he wasn't one. Instead, he says he had a degree in Economics and a 'finance' job at Andersen prior to joining PayPal, then, when talking about his PayPal job negotiations, surprisingly admits he didn't know anything about stock options or how they worked.It doesn't help that the author seems to be the last to find out about company's pivotal events, whether it was a new marketing campaign (he claims he was in charge of marketing) or major business deal.[...]"
3,Interesting but definitely not 5 stars,"I've read all the previous reviews before writing my own, trying to provide a different view.First, the story is interesting. For a change, it's the story of a dot-com that became a success. It provides some inside information about how paypal started.However the book is in my opinion, not very well written - the author uses the same expressions over and over, which gets annoying.Something to know before buying this book is that the author is not a techie. This is important depending on the buyer's profile. As a software programmer, I know I would have been way more interested in the point of views of someone in the IT department.I'm sorry I'm not providing a deep book analysis but this has been done already by the previous reviewers, and I just wanted to mention these things."
4,A good read as told by an insider,"The PayPal Wars provides a good narrative of life inside a silicon valley startup. The story starts from the humble beginnings of yet another dot-com that garnered traction via viral marketing. However, the difference was in this company's nimbleness in maneuvering around its obstacles. The author discusses the company's various competitive responses without boring the reader with too much detail. The reader gets a good appreciation of the importance of timing in the rapidly changing Internet space.Overall a brisk and informative read."
3,How to burn a $100M,"I'm a professional in the online payments industry and enjoyed the look behind the scenes of one of the (now) major players in the market. The books is mostly marketing focused (how to burn a ?100M..), I had hoped to find some more background on the business model and operational issues. All in all a good read."
4,An intimate journey about the making of Paypal,"Written in a first person perspective, this book share so much insight behind its formative business model, competition against beat and entrepreneurial spirit. Impressive reading!"
1,Disappointing,"This was much poorer quality than expected. I would not recommend this product. My package also had a missing leg. Very cheap quality and the finish was inconsistent. I was going to put this in a bathroom, and it was poor quality for even that application."
1,"Physician, Heal Thyself!","I am in shock to find that Dale M. Jacobs, of all people, has written a book about communicating with children. As a child I was ""counseled"" by Dale M. Jacobs. His idea of ""counseling"" was to berate children until we agreed with his proclamations, whether he was right or wrong or not! Mostly he was farther off-base than the Branch Davidians. Having Dale M. Jacobs write a book about communicating with children makes about as much sense as having Dr. Josef Mengele write a book about the care and feeding of twins! Save your money, folks - and ""pay no attention to that man behind the curtain"" ..."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I was happy to unwrap this multifunction and set it up with ease. Then I started to have problems figuring out how to only print one page (still haven't). So I now put one piece of paper in the machine so it will only print the first page since there is no setting or button to push to manually stop it. Then I put in my label paper and it ate it! I put in 5 sheets of label paper, selected the ""coated paper"" function and it pulled all 5 sheets through. I've discarded the box otherwise I would take it back to the store, so I guess I am stuck with it's quirks. A far cry from my old HP multifunction from 1997.Addendum: I did take it back to the store after the software started to corrupt itself and had to perform ""system restore"" on my computer to repair function! I do not at all recommend this machine."
1,Why isn't 0 stars an option? This product is THAT BAD!,the driver software dies after 12 hours or so of inactivity and you need to reboot your computer to be able to print again. Lexmark support does not acknowledge the problem and so you cannot expect they will ever supply a fix.
1,This machine is a pain,"Don't waste your money with this machine. It constantly freezes up the computer when you try to scan or copy --Have to shut down and restart to get anything to work at all. Uses too much ink, and is so slow. I hate this machine. I've had it 3 months and am just biting the dust on it. I want to buy Lexmark products because I own their stock, but....this machine is just a waste of money."
1,"Open the Pod Bay Door, HAL!","I bought this all-in-one for on-the-road trips with my laptop.I don't know how it all works yet, and, if I ever figure it all out, I'll write a supplemental review.Here's the report so far: This is very frustrating. Directions say things like: ""Open the cartridge access doors"" & ""Install the cartridges."" They do not, gentle buyer, tell you HOW to do these things. The unit is constructed of inexpensive (dare I say ""cheap""?) plastic and one is very wary that one may break something whilst trying to accomplish an unguided mission, as there is no indication of which parts are meant to move and which parts are not.Reviewed by TundraVision"
4,Great Product for the low price,"Everyone so far seems to have written negative reviews. I use this product simply to fax, copy, scan less than 50 documents a week. It does the job great.The instructions aren't much good but if you have the common sense to work any fax machine in the first place you can have this out of the box and running in 10 minutes. The fax works great, it scans before calling to save a few bucks, the scanner is slow but is above average for something in this price range. I am a computer professional and once I sorted out a few things the x125 has worked flawlessly with my computer and all applications. For 200 Canadian dollars this things is an incredible value as long as you realize this is obviously for light duty applications.Recommended!"
4,just got today,"Very easy to set-up, up and running in twenty minutes.I have tryed all functions and all work very well.The distinctive ring feature is good and works very well.So far, I would recomend this unit."
1,Nothing but trouble,This product is so unreliable that I have to print my paper two days before turning in just in case that this machine will not function again.To its main sins belong these-errors-jammed paper-lack of communication with main computerand by the way ......... it really sucksssssssss
4,Ipod accessories,Love this band. It stays secure and is very unobtrusive. I bought the bullet shields to use with this and feel my ipod is very protected. I wear it in the gym and when I run. No problems whatsoever - really stays in place.
5,Great product,"After getting a Nano, I had a hard time finding a protective case for use during running that would also allow for easy removal and transfer of my Nano from arm to car mount. This armband case does the job. It is well priced and a better product than any other choices sold in Apple stores and provides solid protection during exercise; running distance in my case. I mounted the case upside down on the armband for two reasons: easier to view the screen as it now faces me and to prevent accidental sliding out of the case to the ground. I don't think the velcro closure would allow this to happen but mounting upside down helps aleviate that fear. I recommend this product. Also, get the Bullet-proof shields from the same company as they are great screen and back protection from scratches."
4,Not that comfortable for me.,"I purchased this for jogging. I'm an average-size female and found these arm bands (I bought 2 so far) are too large for my arm. The material is scratchy. I found it better to wrap it a couple of times around my wrist as that allows for easy access to the controls. If I were a manufacturer, I would design for females. Guess I just haven't found the right gizmo that works right for me."
5,yummy!,"For anyone who loves anything apple flavored and enjoys cooking and experimenting with apples and combining them with other types of tasty foods, Apple Cookbook is an absolute *must* in your recipe book collection. I've always believed that apple flavored desserts are the most satisfying, and a good deal of focus centers on many creations that you can try for yourself in your kitchen. Impress your friends and family by serving them the perfect scrumptious dish! This book covers all kinds of ground. Highly recommended."
1,Zoo Vital Small and Large Parrot Food,"I am so disappointed....... my parrots are all pellets eaters but still, after a month, they will not eat these pellets..... now I have 2 18 lb bags that are a waste of money."
3,okay but small,These are nicely made but are rather small and the detail is hard to see with out getting really close. From a distance they look more like a flower than a group of skulls.
4,Good plunger type test leads but small teeth,"I was expecting a slightly larger metallic teeth on this plunger type test leads. It is sturdy with a good strong spring action to it. It does open quite wide. I would have given it five stars if the metallic teeth were slightly larger for a better grip.Overall, The quality is very good. Up to Fluke standards and pricing. I feel $30.00 dollars to be a little over priced for test leads heads, tho."
3,masons,This was purchased for my Kindle from Amazon and I did not like the book as much as I had anticipated. The book was boring and too verbose...the content was not that good and I would not recommend it.
1,Usual mumbo jumbo about Masonry,"Lots of unbelievable facts quoted to support his hair brained ideas...... as per the modern craze, jump on the Da Vinci band wagon!!!"
2,Read this on Gutenberg first...,"I read this on the Gutenberg project website ([...]). It is a bunch of short stories that were apparently very funny in the late 1800's and early 1900's. I've read other literature from that time and this isn't up to par with the literature from that era that I've read. The writing is very poor.Apparently, George W. Peck wrote a series ""Peck's Bad Boy Books"" and they were very popular when they came out and were even used to advertise various things. So, maybe this just doesn't appeal to my sense of humor but you might love it. CHeck it out on the free site and see before you buy."
5,love it,I've had this iron for over 2 years now. It has been a really great iron. It gets very hot very fast and straightens my hair beautifully. I like the big size because I can get my long curly hair done fast. Highly recommend.
1,"Terrible scanner, terrible support","Was sent this scanner as a warranty upgrade after 2 of their 1000 model didn't transmit a single barcode.This transmits barcodes, but at an accuracy rate of about 2%!A small sample is below. The correct barcode is 774854100222.774841002277484102227745410222774851002277485100227785410222774541022277485400227745410222774854102227785410222774841002277454102227748510022774841002277485410022774851002277484100227785410222774851002277454102227745410826774541022277454102227748541002227748540022774851002277454102227748410022774841002277454102227748540022Adesso claims that they have no issues with these items at all. They also looked at my much longer list of bad scans and claimed that it was 95% accurate. Amazing."
1,ITEM RECEIVED IS NOT THE ITEM PICTURED,"The suet feeder I received is not as pictured. It came with a chain hanger that clips on with an S hook, not the nice solid green hanger that snaps in that is shown in the picture. The shipping is 50% of the cost of this item - suggest you go to your local store to see if you can find something rather than order this especially since the item you receive is NOT THE ITEM PICTURED."
5,All I can say is WOW!!!!,"This thing is incredible! You can completely mix a gallon or a quart with this thing in seconds. The bottom half unsnaps and it's good for a quart, or keep the ""basket"" intact and do a gallon literally in seconds! I use a drill on it's high speed (highest geared) setting and start at the bottom of the can and gently pull up and rotate.I've used 6 year old paint and it was whipped as good as new. When you're done mixing, it's a breeze to clean. Just run it under warm water and spin with a bit of wiping as you go.. A brilliant design."
4,small but effective,"make sure this is the size you want. this will fit 1 and 2 gallon containers, not a 5 gallon bucket."
3,hmmm,"well its a decent product i guess, It mixes fast and im sure is very useful in some cases. I use it for plaster and accidentally let it dry with plaster still in it so its ruined. I feel like i could have done the same work with a mixer but like i said, im sure its great for other applications. Not sure i would buy it again."
4,Id Buy Again,"So, these blocks are expensive in my opinion. 10 blocks for over $20. But, as a special gift, to supplement a traditional/basic wooden block set they're great. I got the mirrored set for my son who loves gazing in mirrors and this sand filled version for his twin sister, she likes movement and color. The quality appears good, in that they wont fall apart any time soon, it seems.However, the sand does leave a residue of sorts on the 'window' of the block so they dont appear as clear and crisp as this picture. there's a light haze of color on whatever part of the window not filled with sand, if that makes any sense. The sand colors dont come across quite as vibrant, and the box of sand wiggles a bit inside the wooden frame, although it seems it would not fall out...So, a splurge, and a bit less impressive, but I would buy them again...!"
4,The No-Hype EP of the Year 2004,"Perhaps it's the fact that I've convinced myself that Fog read Stephen Jay Gould's entire oeuvre before making this album or perhaps it's the fact that Fog can take childhood & adolescent moments, weave them into a deft brief lyric and not have it sound trite or BrightEyes-ish or perhaps it's the rage I feel everytime I walk into Crossroads music in downtown Blacksburg, Virginia and find this album listed in the 'indie-hip-hop' section (I mean, what the f@ck?) regardless of the number of times I've told the faux-hipster staff that Fog does not belong there that I love this album.Look, it comes down to this--do you want pop-subbaculcha or innovation? If the latter, dig into Fog; if the former, go buy the Arcade Fire."
3,Fog - Hummer,"More indie-hip-hop noodling from Fog on their HUMMER EP. They haven't lost any of their eclecticness, as evident by the messy ""Whom That Hits Walls."" But the title track, with its reversed beat, goes for a more melancholy tone, despite the Dada lyrics. ""Melted Crayons"" contrasts an minimal beat with sing-song lyrics -- an interesting experiment, but not quite all together. Contrast that to the almost pure folk of ""Cockeyed Cookie Pusher"" (well, at least until it climaxes). And finally, ""Stink of Kings"" takes a deep, lo-fi path that doesn't as much close out the EP as it just runs out of breath. A hot mess, but an interesting one."
2,"OK, but a bit too wimpy and derivative for me","This is super-happy kitschy high-pitched-vocals bubblegum stuff.I guess I was looking for just a little bit more bite. The vocals are entirely wimpy and fey. We're not talking Monkees-bubblegum here, we're talking 1910 Fruitgum Company or even (gasp!) Lancelot Link & the Evolution Revolution.The music is also very obviously derivative. These aren't just influences, these are imitations. The melody of ""Black Summer"" sounds WAY too much like ""Kokomo"" by the Beach Boys.If your idea of perfect music is, say, watching reruns of the Groovie Ghoulies or Banana Splits jam to some unbearably happy, wimpy three-chord tune, complete with cheesy yeah-yeah's and ahhhh's between the verses, well, here's your record."
3,Shock and dismay,"The words ""for Nikon Capture 4"" need to be in big red blinking letters. This software is NOT for Photoshop. Make sure you know what you are buying, because if not, you'll feel as burned as I was."
1,Not female,"This is not a female speakon adapter. It is a MALE speakon to 1/4"" female adapter. The packaging is also mislabeled."
2,Not my favorite songs,"The film is good, the music is ok, but I made a mistake and bought the CD with the DVD, I was only interested about the movie because they have very good actors, Im fan of Gerard Depardieu."
1,Macgyver..NOT,"I was very disappointed by this book; enough so to try to warn MacGyver fans away from it. Only a couple of the stories truly fit the title, and the stunt described in ""A Spring in the Desert"" frequently results in DEATH!(talk about do-not-try-this-at-home!) Save your money, people."
1,what just happened?,"This book should be titled ""What Would Anyone with a Single Shred of Common Sense Do in the Most Common and Stupid Scenarios Anyone Has Ever Heard of?""This book is awful. If you are expecting stories of people using some gum, a paperclip, and a fruit bowl to build a ski boat, save your money. If you want to learn how to smoke dope through a potato, this is more your speed. The author of this book should be truly ashamed of himself. Each useless anecdote is worse than the last.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. IT REALLY IS AS BAD AS THE OTHER REVIEWERS CLAIM. I figured that since I usually disagree with most people when it comes to reviews, I would give it shot. This is one instance where the public is correct. Avoid this one.What would MacGyver do? He would have written a book that does not make people want to vomit over the money spent and time lost reading it!"
2,Unfulfilled potential,"This book sounded so promising but was a disappointment. I suggest getting it from the library. There are one or two MacGyverisms but the rest aren't even close. I guess this book was only as good as its contributors' submissions. It's a shame, really -- it could have been great!"
1,Where is MacGyver in these stories?,"Do not purchase this book, even as a gift. I was an avid fan of the MacGyver series, so I thought the idea of this book was genious, but the execution was abismal. I found one story, one!, to reflect a true moment of MacGyverism. The remaining stories were either stories about applying extremely obvious solutions, or just tales of life travels. And the author knows this, since the stories are fraught with sensationalism, or foul language, as a poor attempt to keep the reader in shock and awe. What's worse, the publisher chose an author for this book project who often claims he is incapable of producing a MacGuyver moment, which I feel explains why this bizarre collection of tales are completely void of MacGyver traits."
2,Not as witty as you would think,"Personally, this is more readers digest material. Sort of boring, lost interest half way through."
1,BORING,The most un-interesting stories you can think of. Sounded like a cool idea for a book.... but it is not worth the read.
2,Definitely doesn't deliver much gadgetry,"That is what I was expecting when I bought this book: Gadget stories. There were far fewer than I expected. Admittedly, some of the ""fluff"" stories did show a shimmer of last-minute spin-doctor genius, but that isn't what Mac was about. When I did stuble upon the few stories of gadget improv, the book was almost completely devoid of the scientific explanations (which were done in voice over on the series), of how it worked.DO NOT BUY if you are, or are buying for a MacGuyver fan.On the upside, this does make a decent bathroom reader. The individual stories are well written, and short enough that you don't need to commit large chunks of time to reading."
1,Off color,"I thought my 11 year old would love the book. Fortunately, we previewed it before he did. There is too much bad language and sexual content. I would not recommend this book at all."
2,If you never touched a tool in your life you'll be amazed.,"As my title states, if you've ever fixed anything in your house or car by yourself then this book is NOT for you. This book is for people that have a hole in drywall and call 10 friends or 4 home improvement companies to come over and fix it for them. Yuppies who have lost cell phone signal and start to have convulsions when their car doesn't start will enjoy this book. Enough bashing I guess. This book was not what I expected, I kept waiting to read something thrilling all the way to the end. It never came."
1,Drivel,"Randomly chosen story of improvised genius # 1: People annoyed at inability to bathe and resultant stinkiness caused by water shortage during hot summer get the genius idea to... wear cologne.Randomly chosen story of improvised genius # 2: Writer hired to write story for book realizes that she has no story, and gets the genius idea to... recount the plot of a MacGyver episode as if happened to her.I gave up at that point. But judging by other reviews here, those two stories were absolutely typical."
4,Fun read,"This was a fun read. The book is a little short, and some of the stories stretch to qualify as MacGyver moments. but all said a fun way to spend a few hours."
1,Beyond Disappointing,"This book is plain awful! Near all of the solutions in the book are far from true MacGyverism. The author claims he's unskilled with improvisation, he isn't lying, if he's impressed with the stories people submitted, he can't be a handy guy with quick wits. The only thing good with the book is the title, I was mislead by it and purchased the book."
1,Awful,"Wow, you used a knitting needle to replace the pin on your clutch? great story.This book is awful."
5,unique book,"This is a very unique book, book was shipped one day after order - amazing. Highly recommend vendor"
5,Bilingual Ritual,This ritual book is the answer to those who have been requesting a funeral ritual book that is bilingual. The left page is in English and the right page in Spanish so it is very easy to switch between the languages for a bi-lingual liturgy. The text is sufficiently large and they did a much better job with translation than you find with some bi-lingual texts.
2,it was okay...,"I found more information on papillions, specifically-online! I found most of the information to be general as opposed to specific about the papillion breed. I recently brought home my papillion puppy, three weeks ago and I am not impressed. It is definately not a ""complete pet owners manual""."
2,Papillions,"Starting with the title of the book, Papillions, you can see that the correct spelling for this type of dog is PAPILLONS!!! There is no i after the L's in Papillons. This is a short book with some good advice, however, there are far better Papillon books out there. See my reviews on other Papillon books for the best one for you."
2,not pleased,"I bought this book for a birthday present for my adult daughter.It is such a thin little book, I had to go buy another gift to go with it. Not worth the money."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book because I love mysteries and gardening, and the author seems like a nice guy. However, by halfway through I was turning pages as fast as I could, not because it's a page-turner but because I wanted to be done with it. As another reviewer mentioned, the book is full of cliches and one-note good guys/bad guys. Poor dialogue, excessive irrelevant details, awkward use of Britishisms, and thoroughly unbelievable behavior on the part of the husband during the last part of the book (humorous comments on the weather, for example) made this hard to read. Definitely a 'first novel' - maybe he'll get better as he goes on."
3,Average read,""" The Blue Rose"" is a somewhat typical British cozy. There is a village, a garden, an amateur sleuth, and, of course a murder. What makes or brakes this type of mystery are characters. Are they vivid or cardboard? In this book, unfortunately they are not very interesting or complex. Good people are goody two shoes, and bad people are just mean ogres.In all fairness I found this book to be a pleasent, albeit average read. I might try another one in this series. Mr. Eglin might get the hang of it."
3,Great Entry,"This was the first of Eglin's books that I read, and it took me awhile to realize that the main character was the rosarian rather than the young couple. It was fast paced andleft me eager for more."
1,I'm disappointed in the reviews for this book,"I picked up this book on a whim. I didn't know the author, but since I am a gardener and I enjoy mysteries and the reviews on the cover were favorable, I thought I would enjoy it.The first few chapters were ok, interesting premise, likable characters, but after that it degenerated into a mawkish mess, with cliches that usually only tacky romance writers use.Example: ""It's only a flesh wound"" says Alex about his friend being shot in the leg. And other gems such as ""The man collapsed under the jarring impetus of Alex's perfectly executed rugby tackle."" (As far as we know Alex doesn't play rugby, so why is it a rugby tackle?)and ""What a stroke of luck it had been, her eavesdropping just at that very moment."":read ...needed a way to move the plot along.This seemed very amatuerish to me and I am quited disappointed in Publisher Weekly and the Washington Post for recommending it."
1,Don't waste your time,"Slow going, a lot of toing and froing, the actors doing nonsensical stuff to keep the improbable story line going. Don't waste your time. If you haven't yet, do read Donna Leon, Andrea Camilleri, The Cadfael Chronicles by Ellis Peters. Anne Perry, the Thomas/Charlotte Pitt series or Sharon Kay Penman. I would give this no star but as you are probably aware the ratings are rigged, at least one is mandatory."
5,Just what I was hoping!,"I first met Anthony Eglin's style of writing through the Mystery of the Wild Rose. It was a style I was not used to, and while it did take a good chapter to settle in, by the time I finished I was hot on the trail in search of another A.E. novel! After reviewing the others through this website, I decided to try The Blue Rose next. I was SO pleased to find another such pleasant read. My thought is that if you liked The Cat Who series, by Lilian Jackson Braun, you might enjoy this series, as well. They're both light, enjoyable reads, but A.E. would appeal to gardeners who like light reads. You could say the difference between tea, and coffee, but I'm not sure that wouldn't be too trite a comparison. I loved it, and that settles it! Well, not quite, because now I have to buy another...."
5,TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF COOKING,"My first attempt at pressure cooking was a resounding success. I cooked short ribs, veggies and topped it off with a gravy from paradise. Great recipe I found online somewhere. This unit is electric and totally self-regulated which allows me to worry about the football game instead of the pressure or temperature in the pot as it cooks. I failed to build in the time it takes to get to the right pressure and the time it takes to reduce the pressure but I'll know better next time. If the recipe says 30 minutes, add about 20 to that. Loved the ease with which this unit operates and cleanup was nothing. The food was superb. I'm sold."
5,Return of the Revolutionaries,I have never been particularly interested in reincarnation but I found this to be a fascinating book to read. It has all sorts of famous people...I find myself going back to it time and time again to check on someone I think might be in it and I missed. Walter Semkiw has done lots of research and whether you were to believe it or not it is a very entertaining book. I will always keep mine to refer back to.Dorothy Gautier
5,Outstanding book!,"Return of the Revolutionaries is an excellent read! It is full of truth and history and also has validation. I found myself going slowly at the end of the book just so I wouldn't finish it as fast! The case histories have been researched thoroughly by Dr. Semkiw and he also has Ahtun Re to validate accuracies. The stories ring true, in my heart, and it is not a surprise that these souls have returned to continue their helpfulness to mankind in their current incarnations. The people who give this book a low rated review, are just young souls that are ignorant and have not realized the truth of the world and the universal human. But it is exactly these type of people that need to read this type of book, and it is just icing on the cake for those of us that already know the truth. I would highly recommend this book to everyone!"
5,Groundbreaking and Thought Provoking,"`Return of the Revolutionaries' applies a logical, coherent schema to something nebulous (life after death), by investigating and reporting commonalities within numerous case studies. The accounts are detailed, uncanny, thought-provoking, and challenging to most widely-held Western beliefs ... so if you can put your own prejudices aside and open your mind to the possibilities held within these pages, you might have a life changing experience; I certainly did. Kudos to Dr. Semkiw for his passion, his vision, his exhaustive work, and his willingness to introduce these theories to the world. This is a fascinating read."
3,Works well with Tape adapter or Aux port - Not well for FM,"I tried the FM output option 1st, however I live near a major city and although it has 4 output stations (yes - only 4) - 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and 88.7 - there are 2 strong stations near me that are on 88.1 and 88.5 which pretty much made the FM option a ""non"" option due to lots of interference.The unit comes with an Aux port hookup, but my stereo is the one that came with the car from the manufacturer (Toyota) and does not have an aux ""in"". You can get an FM attenuator installed by a professional that acts as a bypass to the FM antenna, but from all the reviews I've read on those - they still won't work as well as a direct hookup (tape or aux port).I broke down and bought a tape adapter for $15 and now it sounds great!"
1,Sirius Satellite Radio Car Dock - SIRCK1,"Didn't work properly when received. One of the connectors was damaged. I'm not too happy about this. It is in a sealed container and is supposed to be new, but it looks as if it may have been used or sold before. I won't deal with Amazon again for anything but books and CD's."
4,Saved me from a driving nightmare.,"So here is the deal. I'm a converted radio listener that never thought they would pay for radio. I had the PNP, the home kit and 2 boomboxes. However, I never really thought I would use a car kit.So we get ready to take a vacation and guess what, we are travelinig through Wyoming and South Dakota. Yep, you read correctly. FM wasteland baby! I suffered a 6 hour drive without the car kit. Ordered it off of Amazon and had it overnighted to my hotel room. That's right; overnighted! The trip home was way more tolerable with my Sirius.I didn't have any FM problems, but that's because those states don't have any FM stations worth listening to. ;)Great adapter for those of us who bought early! I'm just really ticked off they don't make these kits adaptable to all models. Now these are becoming impossible to find."
3,Okay film,"I purchased this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan and I knew he had a cameo appearance in it. Shah Rukh Khan appears later in the film as himself and spends a few minutes talking to the main character in the film. Hrithik Roshan is in the film. And for fans of his, this film will be fun to see. Juhi Chawla is in the film, too. The storyline of the film follows a young man's experiences as he strives to become a movie star. Although it is a movie and the camera unfolds the story in a movie fashion...it felt ""documentary-ish"" to me. I guess there wasn't a strong enough plot to draw me in as a viewer. It was nice to see cameos of several famous actors and actresses in this film, though."
5,"Great book, Great Lakes","Stonehouse is a master when it comes to Great Lakes research & storytelling. This book is more research than storytelling, but it is still great. The synopsis of the wrecks are short, sweet & to the point. Awesome book & highly recommended."
5,Great Read!,"August Patriot is a very well written, detailed and interesting book. But that's what I expected from a guy like Leland Stephens. He's been there and done that. If you like adventure, romance and realistic action... you'll like this book."
5,A Convincing Tale - Too Convincing,"I consider it a great honor that Steve-O asked me to write a review of his thoughtful and exciting novel, August Patriot. After reading it, I'm convinced that the whole of it is true-only the names have changed.As a part-time deputy sheriff, ranch hand and retired squid, I remember well the drug war that began in the U.S. during the 1960s. Sadly, during the late 90s, this war has escalated to the point of our country's moral self-destruction.Our government of the 90's has failed to stop the flow of drugs across our borders on Mexican 18-wheelers and aboard ships bound for Cuba and other Caribbean islands. Why? Steve-O may have come up with the answer.Master Chief Petty Officer Gary R. Smith (Ret.) RMCM, USN Jacksboro, TexasGary Smith is co-author of Death in the Jungle, Death in the Delta, and sole author of Master Chief and co-author of Demo Men. The first three books cover his military career chronologically as an UDT/SEAL/EOD Navy enlisted man from 1964 to 1984."
4,Superior effort by a first-time novelist.,"This page-turner by Leland G. Stephens takes readers into the mind and heart of his protagonist, Steve Parker. After setting the stage the plot quickens sending Parker around the globe fighting in his own unique way for America's freedoms. It leaves you winded--and looking for the next episode of this August Patriot.Pat Hyland - Author of Presidentional Libraries and Museums."
3,Not what I expected,"I guess based on the reviews I was expecting more than pages listed with all types of rooms that the average house would not have with blanks to fill in the size of the rooms. Most of the blanks for the rooms you would have no idea how to comlete unless you built or renovated your house. I would have saved money buying a binder and marking the sizes and dimensions of the rooms, windows, etc."
1,What's this about ?,"Broly and Return of Broly already came out with the first dragon ball z blu-ray release, does this mean that in order to have all 13 movies we've to have Broly and return of Broly twice !! what a rip-off, Funimation!!instead of this realese the one that we need is movies 11, 12 and 13 on one blu-ray not a compilation of Broly AGAIN!!"
2,meh,"i do enjoy dragonball z, i truly love the games and tv shows, however this collection of movies was not worth while for me. the first movie is the only worth seeing."
4,Fun Bluray,Great Bluray movie. Has all three films in English and japenese. Not much beyond that. Picture and sound are great.
1,"Wow, you want me to review this movie?","Fans of DD....sorry. Amazon sent me an email to review this and I couldn't resist. I bought this for my wife. In my opinion, it is one of the worst movies I have ever had to suffer through. I suppose the dancing is good, but that ain't for me. Story line? Acting? Yea, both are lame. ."
1,Great concept that doesn't work.,"I bought the underwater walkie-talkies for my kids thinking they would be a great new pool toy. Much to our disappointment they did not work. We tried them in a variety of circumstances and different pools. Nothing intelligible.This was about a year ago and maybe they have improved them since.They look durable, not sure what educational value except maybe ""caveat emptor""!Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback."
3,Color washes off,"I like these glasses, however, after only a few months the color that is around the bottom has faded on some of the glasses. I wash these in the dishwasher, which may cause this to happen. The product does say dishwasher safe, however."
2,Very Hard to Replicate,"Beautiful pictures, but the dishes were nearly impossible to replicate and some were overly arranged. Food as art. Some of the ingredients are unavailable or overly expensive. But the pictures in the book are fabulous!"
2,Pretty but not practical.,"I actually purchased this book. The recipes are not practical if you do not live in Hawaii. Unless you are a chef, the directions are difficult to execute. He lists no alternative ingredients for mainlanders like myself.If you want a picture book to stick on your coffee table, this might work. Otherwise I would rather pass. I will be selling this book on Amazon shortly."
4,Classic and simple,"This is a very nice, classic looking ring. But be aware that it's a lot smaller than how it appears in the picture."
4,"A Good Guide to Habitat Restoration, with caveats...","If somewhat superficial in its discussion of the ecological basis for restoration, and how environmental interactions can and do interact with restoration efforts in unpredictable ways, still this guide is a good addition to the Habitat Restorer's (Restorationists?) toolkit.This book will be useful to you if you are a novice embarking on a new restoration project, or if you have some experience with restoration, but have not worked in a position of leadership.Run, though, and do not walk, as you seek to accompany this guide with detailed ecological knowledge about your area from researchers and restorers at work there. No book can comprehensively offer advice about where you live, in your home place. Only you, and people like yourself, can acquire that sort of expertise.Another useful book for the restorer's library--more explanatory as to right attitude rather than technique--is Gary Snyder's _The Real Work_."
3,If you Tap get these.,"this product save machinist alot of searching around in your box for the right tools to tap a hole, its all right here.Excellent for getting a feel on small tapped holes."
2,Great Music,"A great album from Jerry and the J'Mo's. I'm really looking foward to the next album. I've managed to catch several shows recently, including two in Costa Rica, and a fablous Jerry Solo acoustic show in Portland, and continue to be amazed by Jerry's song writing and guitar playing."
3,Wish it could be used with a keylock handle,"Have an older version of this on my kitchen door and like so much I purchased this for my garage door. Unfortunately, this can not be used with a keylock handle on the outside so cannot use it."
3,Learn to Read,"Power Chinese is a rather old program for Windows. My newer computer had difficulties with the software because of how it runs in Windows. I would recommend that the company update their software, because nobody will really know how well it will work on their computer.This being said, if it DOES work on your computer it is rather good. The program is not rigorous, and seems repetetive, but it really works to help you slowly remember characters you've seen. This is by no means a good stand-alone program, and should be used in combination with Chinese classes, audio tapes, and books. It is self-paced, so you can go as quickly or slowly as you'd like and then come back later to where you left off.This program requires computer-sit time, too. If you're not willing to set time aside each day for this then it is probably not worth your money. Overall, it is another good tool in language acquision."
2,Good thing I got this for free...,"Baxter makes a few worthwhile points, but overall this is a dry and dated discussion of public speaking, coupled with a ""men's training"" class perspective. Baxter's writing occasionally makes erroneous application from Scripture in the interests of advancing his points."
3,quarky,"Brand new out of box, had trouble with feeder pulling single sheets.Lucky it was covered by epson and we had a local authorized service center check it."
2,"Jams Paper, Does not pull it evenly, impossible to use",Tried to use it to print on EMS shipping labels. This printer does not takes these forms. Wasted like 50 forms and gave-up.
3,Try as We May to Change... We Are Who We Are.,"Without doubt, this film is a feast for the eyes, but not for the mind.It has a simple plot. A deluded Indian woman weedles her way into an upper class British home and she starts the process of eliminating established servants (their word, not mine) and replacing them with relatives (even by supplying her own sister as a wet-nurse) who would in turn make her more important in the household. She succeeds until she pushes just a little bit too far then her world collapses. She also destroys the British family in her fall from grace.Beautifully filmed and the casting is absolutely perfect. As in most Merchant Ivory films, the pace is slow, but determined (not wishy-washy).The few brief moments of male frontal nudity was (to my eyes) an unexpected, exciting diversion in a somewhat orderly, sometimes dry production."
3,Cotton Mary,Very well written...a good movie for people who have lived through the British era in India and not of pure Indian decent. The struggle to find ones place between the Pompus British who over took India and the Anglo Indian wanting so much to belong.
1,Cliche drivel,"I've watched all the Merchant Ivory productions of note including ""A Room With a View"", ""Howard's End"", and ""Remains of the Day"". Within the first half hour of ""Cotton Mary"", I couldn't believe the venerable house of Merchant Ivory let this one out the door! The usual subtlety, nuance and visual emotiveness of the actors is missing. Madhur Jaffrey offers an unimaginative performance as an Anglo-Indian stuck in the limbo of two cultures with a history of antagonism and admiration betweem them. Greta Scacchi barely drifts throught the entire movie as a naive and weak-willed wife. There is so much potential in the basic storyline but it is rendered into a soap-opera version of what should have been a poignant and bittersweet story.For those looking for a more sensitive treatment of the Anglo-Indian dilemma, look for ""Jewel in the Crown"", a multi-episode Grenada production which appeared in PBS in the late 1980s. It will soon be available on DVD. Don't waste your time with ""Cotton Mary""."
5,New York Central's Mercury,"Ordering a book via internet is always kind of an adventure, you'll never know what you get. But, in this case I was really impressed. The book presents the train, the development of the engine and its coaches up to the bone china which was used with illustrations of good quality and size (even some rare color shots). It was great fun to read and browse."
5,Affordable Quality,"I have used Hoya filters for many years and have always thought they make a quality product. This ND filter is no exception. It is well made and the thread pitch is precise to match those of the lens. Screws on easily without trying to cross thread like some of the cheaper brands. Good quality glass makes this a bargain compared to the competition in this price range. I would rate the performance of this filter with that of filters costing much more.It is easy to cut corners on filters but do you really want to put a $15 filter on a $1,000 lens?"
2,Old,"This book is ok for a detailed version of horse ailments, and gives quality natural home remedies, but is very old. It was copywritten in '69, and the pictures are not very accurate. I have found better books, with more up to date names of diseases and symptoms, and do not recommend this book to anyone new to horse ownership, not at all what I was looking for."
1,SUCKS REAL BAD,As I said SUCKS LIKE BAD. Couple Questions to you who are going to buy this.1) Why would you buy this?2) Why would you want to go around looking like the glasses gots a wart? (Hence the camera)3) Why would you want to buy something thats almost impossible to develop film?4) Why not buy a regular camera like everybody else?5) Why buy something that can easily break in seconds? (Just by putting in the film)6) Why would you by something that weighs about 1/2 a pound?7) Why? Why? Oh why would you buy something that sucks?8) Why?
3,Didn't really like this product,"The film was incredibly difficult to load properly so that it would advance to the first picture. It took two adults and a pair of hemostats to finally get it to work. Inconsistent operation of shutter. As far as imagination stimulation, it was fine, but all in all we didn't think it was too great of a buy. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Better for older kids,"I bought this for my six year old son for Christmas. He was very excited when he opened it, but quickly became frustrated when he did not have enough grip strength to push the bulb to take the picture. I had a little trouble myself. The pictures it takes are kind of cool, but I would definately suggest this for a child at least 8 or 9 years old."
1,Pictures didn't turn out,"I got this toy for my 7 year old son. When we went to get the film developed, not a single picture came out. The developer told us that in her experience, the only pictures that come out using that camera are the ones taken outdoors. My son was very disappointed."
4,everything is green,mta2 screwed and chopped is off da chain. there are lots of wild sounds here. it sounds really dirty. david banner's got a sweet voice which also sounds kind of like dirt. lots of great cuts on here.
5,Perfect,I'm using it as a server cage. I threw 2 Dell 2900 Poweredge servers in there and they fit perfect. A much better solution than a $200 server cage that only fits one server. Great cable management built right in.
3,Steiner 10x50 Merlin,"This is no reflection on Amazon, but I was disappointed in the overall quality of the Merlin 10X50 binoculars which I received today and immediately returned. The rubber eyepieces are not user friendly for either eyeglass wearers or non-eyeglass wearers. The neoprene material feels cheap at best. The image is far brighter in my Nikon Action 10x50 $100 binoculars which are porro prism type and not the expensive roof prisms of this supposedly superior design. Eye relief is difficult and you must stay away from the eyepiece rubber in order to receive full image size or the image vignettes. Steiner does make quality products, but you must exceed the entry level pricing three- fold before they become outstanding! The snap click objective lens cap retention system is time consuming during use. Overall I am disappointed. Amazon has a great return policy and they do a fine marketing job and always deliver their items as promised and with great E-mail response. Ted Bates"
3,New sickmade CD is dissapointing,"This is the latest release from Sickmade (excuse the ck I don't rip) and to be blunt it is a little dissapointing. That whole gangsta, ripgut sickness is less apparent on this album. Listen to ""Loaded"" and you can totally tell the difference. That CD is straight sick. Don't get me wrong the lyrics are tight and always are; Tall Can does a great job. But I don't know what's up with the beats. Some songs are coo, like the one T-Nutty is in and Phonk Beta's ""Shiesty."" D-Dubb also has a smooth song. But overall I say this CD doesn't even compare to the classics like ""Season of da Sickness,"" ""Loaded,"" or ""Now Eat."" ""Lynch By Inch"" even starts to go mainstream with the beats and all. If you want that original underground gangsta ish then get Sicx's album, Zagg's, or Lynch's. COS's album is also tight. But ""Uthanizm,"" I don't know I ain't feelin it dog."
1,Should not have put this out,Man this sucks Bad lynch is not even on alot of the songs and the others on here just not bringing it I think siccmade just put somthing out just to do it dont buy this you will thank me if they have it on here were you can lisen to it first pls do that you will see what I mean drop the ball big time
3,"Man Lynch, Whatzup bruh????","This album is just not crackin.... I bought it cuz I gotta keep my collection up to date, but dayum... This wasnt what I expetced, AT ALL!"
3,Hot Summer Nights,"This is the first book I read from this author. Just something I came across and the cover grabbed my attention. This was just one of those books that I can't figure out where it went wrong, but it just didn't grab my attention as much as I hoped. It was good, just not great. There was so many characters introduced right as the book got going and I had to flip back and re-read some parts just to refresh my mind on who's kids belonged to who. After it got going it stuck with me, but at first it was so much information it overwhelmed the story a bit. The sex scenes were hot and I thought this was a good read"
4,Slimline capacitive stylus,"I had one before , however through use the split and I had to get a long narrow stylus. Thanks"
2,"OK, I guess",This is better than some other's I've tried...It hasn't died yet.Placing the sensor probe in an appropriate area is tricky. My gauge shows outrageously high temps (even in the winter) until the vehicle is moving then it is pretty accurate. The probe has an adheasive back to allow you to stick it somewhere. I haven't done this because I'm moving it around to see where it works best. I've tried a few of these type of sensors and none seem to be as good as the factory installed types on the cars that are equiped with them (kind of a no brainer).Bottom line...better than nothing for me.
3,I like it,If you read the directions and place the sensor within the front bumper the readings are within 2-4 degrees inside and out. I have had no problems with it after 7 months and I am looking at buying another one for a different vehicle.
1,Celsius or Fahrenheit - that is the question,"Had this installed for about a year, never worked correctly because it kept flipping to C no matter how many times I'd set the switch to F. About a month ago it started displaying ""LO"" for inside temp. GARBAGE! JUNK! I finally got fed up with this ... device ... and threw it into the garbage. Bought Radio Shack wireless 63-1088 a few days ago and am testing it in the home for possible car use. It is working so far, so if it continues to work properly, I will try it in the car in a week or so and report back. Main issue is the display is rather large for car use, but that can be overcome by mounting it under the GPS bracket."
2,Easily destroyed by squirrels,Initially this was such a great find. Birds loved it and sought it out immediately but holes for suet were quickly chewed to bits and enlarged until the suet plugs could not be contained and just dropped out. Totally unusable because it was made of wood!
5,A Mexican Favorite,We recently went to Mexico and they played this song constantly. It tends to grow on you after awhile. It has a very good beat.
3,Great Race tunes chopped down for radio play,"First off, before I get flamed or anything like that, I am no radio DJ nor a club DJ but I know what I like in the club music. I did get a chance to see Westbam and DJ Dick in Vancouver, B.C. in 1991 at Graceland. It was awesome! 4 turntables going at once!Anyway, back to the review. This is a good starter CD/album to listen to if you don't know where to find the 12"" vinyl on CD or EP on CD. All of the tracks are shortened by about 1/2 (half) the original length. When you buy it, you are thinking, 'COOL! I just got all the long songs that I wanted and didn't have to buy 3 or more EP CD's with different mixes on it! I saved a ton of $$$$!'Not happening! It is like the record label got cheap on using ALL of the CD media or wanted you to get hooked just a bit and then go and find the real CD's that you wanted for the extended play. Kind of a bummer, a buzz kill.Finding Westbam is hard enough!The truth..."
2,Don't bother.,"Unless you really want to support RMS, stick to the original. Why mess with perfection? I thought it was just a remaster, but the vocals were redone and some of the original energy is lost. Oh well, buying the OG now."
4,eye opener,is a good book to get the understanding of what Jesus when through to save the world is a eye opener
4,Very Interesting,It is more of a study than a book to read just for enjoyment. It is a very compelling read.
1,Not at all what I expected........,"No new insights, nothing particularly joyful or evocative, it seemed like pure fundamentalist Christian pabulum. Chapter one was great and then everything just feel apart. Not my cup of tea."
3,College text,What do you say about college textbooks? You need them and you want them as cheaply as possible since they are all overpriced. Was as promised and shipped promptly.
3,Great Service from Amazon,"Hello,I was apprehensive at first about ordering my book from Amazon but I liked the price and after reading the other reviews I decided to take a chance.I did not want to buy a used book because I did not want to chance getting an 'as is' product. I got confirmation that the book was shipped 2 days after I ordered it and lo and behold to my major surprise, I got the book the NEXT day!! I was very happy about this but even happier when I saw that the book was exactly what I had wanted. Thanks Amazon for the great service. Hey I believe we should give credit where credit is due. As for the actual contents of the book, I will get back to you on that since I just started using the book for my first sociology class.It seems ok so far but I will let you know. Thanks again."
4,lousey service,"I sent a 5007 to Liteon for repair under warranty in July of 2006 and have never received it back yet. I got a e-mail in Autust saying it was in testing but still no unit. About Sept 2006 I called tech support and ask them about the unit. They said they were having trouble with their shipping dept, but I would soon arrive. Here it is Feb 2007, and they still have the dvd recorder. They have to have the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER."
1,"Echoing Steinberg, Great Doorstop","The recorder worked fine for about two months. Then it stopped recognizing blank disks.1) Called customer service, which for Liteon is an oxymoron. Told me it would only take certain brands of disks. It did -- for about two weeks.Repeat 1), told me I needed to update firmware. I did. It worked for about one month.Now it is a playback machine which will playback some but not all discs, and will not recognize blank discs of any brand, and hence will record nothing."
5,A great introduction of bible teachings for the young.,"Teaching any lesson from the bible has its difficulty, but to the young can seem near impossible.As a father of a six and two year old, I found the the six stories from the Christopher Churchmouse series contained in this treasury a great introduction to the life lessons that the bible teaches.The stories within held the attention of the six year old and the lovely pictures by Dennis Hockerman, kept the interest of the two year old.It is my hope that the author/publisher plan other treasuries of Christian living and love. del"
5,Cloves,"This is a tingly vegetable and chalk based toothpaste with ingredients like the oil of peppermint, spearmint and clove. Cranberry extract purifies and refreshes the gums while the bentonite clay scrubs and polishes your teeth. Worth trying if you are allergic to regular toothpaste. The addition of geranium oil was a pleasant surprise.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Fluoride Free=Big Problems,"I used this toothpaste for over a year, twice a day. I also used regular toothpaste once a day. This toothpaste does not contain any fluoride, which is great if you love going to the dentist and getting fillings and not so good if you really dislike having cavities. Do not only use this to replace regular toothpaste...it is extremely unhealthy for your teeth and WILL cause cavities because fluoride is required for healthy teeth, and this paste does not contain any.The flavor is not very good and the aftertaste is terrible.I do not believe they make this anymore, which is wonderful-because all it did was cost me a lot of money and time to fill SEVEN cavities because of using this toothpaste for over a year."
1,Worst Ever,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen.Great premise.Bad actors.Bad writing.Bad editing.Bad, bad, bad.Like I said, great premise. All else isn't worthy of explaining. Don't even rent it.I don't recommend this movie.Anthony Trendl"
1,"Good laughs, Terrible movie","I think that this film proves, if anything, that anybody can convince others to fund any screenplay. So in a sense I suppose this film offers hope to filmmakers everywhere. Check it out. Airy and with good intentions, this film may entertain you by its terrible screenwriting, acting, and direction."
3,Very Imaginative,"This was a wonderfully imaginative movie. What an idea, if one of the greatest artists in history came back in modern times. An artist that was shunned and reaped no rewards for his life's works returns to find that his paintings are now worth 10's of millions of dollars (or 100's of millions). If you have the ability to enter into the third party of film; to believe the unbelievable, you'll like this movie. It's not a ""solid"" movie. Some of the acting leaves want for more, as does the cinematography. However, it was thoroughly enjoyable. All round, I liked it."
4,Go man Gogh!,"Enjoy this whimsical story showing Van Gogh transported into modern time to get a second chance. What he discovers is that his art is highly valued and since he never sold a painting in his lifetime, he seeks to reclaim his work and in the process falls in love! Lots of fun esp. watching Sally Kirkland as a relentless detective seeking to bust this mental case who believes he is truly Van Gogh!"
2,It's Not The Worst I've Ever Seen...,"Van Gogh wearing eyeliner, and delivering some of the worst movie lines ever in an accent that ocillates between an obscure Transylvanian dialect and slurred Irish. Good Times. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly one of the most ridiculous."
1,I've got to go thumbs down on this one.,"This stuff smells exactly like Mr. Clean floor cleaner, I even compared them side by side. It is watery with almost no lather. My hair doesn't feel clean at all and it has no cool sensation like tea tree mint should have."
4,it's the change of life shampoo for me!!!,"I'm at that wonderful time in a woman's life known as perimenopause. For me, that means night sweats....and LOTS of them. This, as i have found out, makes for an itchy head if one doesn't adjust shampoo to suit the new sweat schedule. I've used this shampoo for the last month, and it has taken away my itchy sweaty residue head, which is a relief, because really.....does it SOUND like i need an additional problem in my life right now? :) I'm giving 4 stars, cuz I can't quite tell if it is stripping extra color out of my hair or not....so I withhold a single star for later when that becomes clearer. But til then I'll be scrubbing away with this wonderful smelling shampoo that has taken away one of the things that was making me more aggro. Hooray for Avalon Organics."
3,"Pretty good, but not the best.","I bought this product at health food store over a year ago, found in cheaper on Amazon.com of course, and during that time the the shampoo had a ""new & improved formula"" and it's not a good as before. The shampoo used to be stronger and thicker. Still smells nice and works well."
1,Not good for me.,"My hair is oily, and sometimes I have acne on my scalp. I thought the tea tree and mint is nice for me, but it makes my scalp more and more itch...so I have to throw it..."
3,Thin & not as minty as hoped.,"The fragrance of this shampoo is no where near as powerful as I would like it to be.It's a sweeter, softer mint than peppermint.The consistency is also very thin."
4,fresh clean feeling,"I like how this shampoo left my hair with a fresh clean feeling. It also stopped my scalp from itching better then any other shampoo I have tried. I still have some flakes but better than before, I have really dry skin so I'm not surprised by this."
2,Didn't work for me,I bought this shampoo so it could help me with Scalp Psoriasis because ive used tree oil in my hair to help with the psoriasis and it does work. This shapoo just dried my scalp even more and it flacked a lot. The tea tree oil shampoo did come on time. i would buy this shampoo again.
1,I bought it; I tried it; I sent it back.,"I bought it; I tried it; I sent it back. This case is bulky, awkward to use, and provides limited protection. It is most unfortunate that this not-inexpensive camera is sold without a case of any kind, but this is certainly not a reasonable solution to that problem. Surely somebody is marketing a more useful case for the G9! I am still looking for it."
3,OK but not as good as the Japanese model,There is a much better case available in Japan - made by Canon for the G9. This case is fine but it doesn't attach to the camera so it is either on or off. The Japanese version attaches to the tripod mount and can remain attached to the camera while you are using the camera - more practical and much better looking - kind of retro. To me it looks like something you would expect to see on an old Leica range finder camera.Anyway the PSC-5000 is not a bad case - just not the best case for the G9.
2,This is a silly design,"It is made with nice leather. But the design is silly: it has a top lid that could have been made a little longer to fasten to the front of the case. It hase also another lid that hinges on the bottom front and covers the front and the top, which are already covered by the main case and the lid that I first mentioned. Complicated for no reason. Adds more weight than necessary.Ric Polastri - Sacramento, CA"
3,Perfect fit,This semi-hard leather case fits perfectly for Canon G9. But it doesn't have space for spare batteries.
5,Oops.,"It has a strap so it can be attached to your belt. It stays closed via a magnetic snap, assisted by velcro. To open the PSC-5000 case the front pulls away at the top. A small, second case comes with the package. It's about the size of a 1-1/2"""" cube. It can be used to hold a spare memory card and a backup battery for the camera. The second case attaches to the side of the camera case. The case is compact and well built.I ordered this case by mistake and it was too small for my camera. I should have ordered the Canon PSC-4000 Deluxe Leather Case that is for the Canon SX10IS Digital Camera which I have. I returned the PSC-5000, but after looking it over, I was impressed and did order the PSC-4000."
4,Canon G4 hard camera case,"The case is well designed to protect the camera and can be mounted on one's belt or worn over the shoulder (the strap of the camera protrudes from the case to make shoulder use possible). The case has a small holder for an extra battery and an extra SD memory card. I think that I will find the case useful, though I have bought an inexpensive soft case (about $10) that may be handier than the hard case. Since the Canon G4 is a high-end digital camera, it may be best to have the hard case to protect the camera in certain situations, even though the soft case might be handier in other situations."
4,"Good, but Could be Better","This case is well made and sturdy. It is easy to get the G7 in and out and protects the camera well. I love the little case that goes on the side of the bigger case. It fits an extra battery and a memory card in an efficient way. Space isn't wasted. It is super easy to get the battery and card in and out.On the down side; I would like the belt clip to open and close, the magnetic snap on the main case and the battery case open too easily. They have opened as I am carrying the case. The snap on the side strap also undoes too easily, and I would like a wrist strap to be included."
3,Case for Canon G9,"Good materials, good quality, strange system to insert and to pull out the camera, but usefull at the end"
3,Bulky but convenient,Good to protect what you have. But it can be a bit cumbersome to carry around. Perhaps more rounded corners. But overall a decent attempt.
4,If it was only a bit bigger,"Canon PSC-5000 Semi-Hard Leather Case for the Canon G7 and G9 Digital CamerasGreat case is solidly built. Canon G9 fits inside snug like a bug. But those wanting to tote batteries, chargers, accessories, or lens adapters with the camera you'll have to look elsewhere for a larger case."
4,"Not quite ""GO"", but a good follow-up nontheless...","This album doesn't live up to its predecessor ""GO"", but it is a good follow-up. Stomu's label switch from Island to Arista is a bit convoluted, but keeps many things intact. Such as Paul Buckmaster handling the orchestral arrangements, and the familiar cast including Al Dimeola on guitar, Klaus Schulze on synths and Michael Shrieve on drums. Gone is Steve Winwood on vocals, and added are other new players. Not as ethereal as the first, but it has it's moments. Best cuts are ""Mysteries of Love"", ""Beauty"" and ""You and Me"". Definitely recommended. Hard to find, but worth it. Arista re-released it for a VERY short time on CD, but there are plenty of CDR's of this available."
4,Solid Funk/Soul/Fusion Album,"The album basically alternates between some cool funky numbers with smoking guitar solos by Al DiMeola over top-shelf fusion/funk grooves laid down by Michael Shrieve of early Santana fame and Paul Jackson, J. (Headhunters), and soulful slower pieces featuring vocals by British singers Jess Roden and session vocalist Linda Lewis as well as Doreen Chanter, all relatively unknown in their own right, but with powerful contributions on this album. Various synth interludes are provided by Klaus Schulze. Yamashta's percussion and keyboards are less prominent on this album.The tracks, in keeping with the imaginative 70s output in the Fusion genre, are interesting but, in this case, relatively easy listening, which derive their quality from the class of the players and some good writing. At times the strings push the material towards soul-ballad cliches, which accounts for the loss of one star. A must for Al DiMeola fans and some of the best work of Michael Shrieve I've heard."
1,"Go ... away, please.","As brilliant as the original ""Go"" and ""Live From Paris"" albums remain today, ""Too"" is obviously a poorly-conceived last-ditch effort to milk the success of the previous releases. This is dreck, plain and simple; sickening 70s-era disco-pop-funk with an occassional Al DiMeola guitar solo or Klaus Schulze space vibe thrown on top for good measure. Not only is Stevie Winwood sorely missed, but so are the rarely-heard-from DiMeola, Schulze, and Michael Shrieve. Avoid this."
1,what a great album. joe uk,it is now the year 2006. and i got this album when it first came out. and it still sounds has good today has it dit then in the way muisc has gone and sounds. the players on this album are some of the best in the world and the singers are just the right ones for this project.what a great album. if you know what muisc is about then this is for you.lifes to short not to hear this.im joe from the uk. x x x
5,Beautiful colors!,I love the quotable cards and I couldn't believe they have them in mugs. The colors of the fonts are really pretty. I bought 4 of them as Christmas presents to friends.
1,Bad Buy,The bike arrived with a dented rear fender. Screws were missing. Decals and paint were sloppy. Front tire exploded while sitting in my den . Instructions were for other bikes. wheels woiuld not move because of fenders rubbing. Disassembled and sent back. It is better to walk than to buy this bike.
4,Great bike if you can it around $100,"I bought this bike for my wife and we didn't want to pay a lot for something we'll only use occasionally. I'm pretty good with my hands, so I didn't think the assembly was any problem. All I had to do was attach the handle bar to the shaft, bolt on the front tire, bolt on the pedals, assemble the bike seat, and install the fenders. I had to adjust a fenders a bit to ensure they don't rub against the tires. It helped to have the right tools. All in all, an excellent bike for the money. The ride is great! She enjoys it a lot."
2,Joseph McPhail,"PUT 30 LBS. IN BOTH TIRES, BLEW BOTH THE TUBES UP. USED A HAND PUMP SO WOULDN'T PUT IN TOO MUCH. THEY CALL FOR 40 TO 60 LBS. NEVER GOT ANYWHERE NEAR THAT BEFORE THEY EXPLODED, CALLED AND WAS SENT 2 NEW TUBES. WORKS OK SO FAR. NOT TO BAD A BIKE FOR A CHEAP PRICE."
1,It is sad...,it's sad that Goran made this album...after a collaboration with Kayah (Polish pop star) he made another collaboration with old polish singer Kris Krawczyk...well he destroyed all of his songs adding a pop rhythm and silly lyrics...definitly Goran was despaired in the moment he was making this album.it can be heard in every song...
4,Eyes Of Faith,"If you liked Shades Of Black, then you'll love Eyes Of Faith, a witty, yet hard-edged look at a black man's search for God, love and happiness in a society where the deck is stacked against him. The story starts with a bang and ends with a flourish, and is compelling enough to hold your attention throughout.Johnson's characters are lively, multifaceted and will remind you of people you know; they are ""real people"" struggling with real issues just like all of us. He cleverly mixes new characters, characters from Shades Of Black and celebrity cameos to create a diverse and lively ensemble.Johnson's writing style makes this book provocative, in-your-face and very tough to put down once you start reading."
2,Not very interesting,"My book group chose this book by the interesting description here and review. The idea of a spinster leaving her family to become a witch intrigued us all, but we were disappointed in the book. We found the character not very interesting, and the lack of action calmed us all into slumber while trying to read it. It wasn't a terrible book, it had some interesting things to say, but we could not understand all the immensely positive reviews here."
3,Packaging needs updating,"Love'em, but the packaging is way _out sizing_ the cookie profile, as it were, and has becomea bit deceptive and surfeit. I.E. the cookies are getting smaller, but the unnecessary packaging profile and its excessive carbon footprint ratioare quite noticeable.The cookies are down sizing, so I apply a down size on the Star Rating"
1,Poor Manufacturing,"this little book is what I wanted, to glow in the dark, but when it arrived some of the pages were stuck over and taped that way. Instead of waiting for a replacement, I just cut the pages and taped them back together. I should have sent it back, but it seemed easier my way."
2,DON'T put it in the dryer,"I like the design and price of this bed skirt. Without thinking, I put it in the dryer and it was ruined. The middle of the bed skirt, the section covered by the mattress, melted. It was made out of some cheap knit like material."
5,"Beautifully illustrated, unique, fun and informative!","In Star Grazing, Harry Schwartz draws upon his popular television series ""Chef Harry & Friends"" to assembly a unique cookbook that treats us to intimate views of the lifestyles and personalities of his celebrity guests and their favorite creative recipes for fine eating and elegant dining. From Gingered Crab Puffs, Portuguese Mussel Pot, and Orange Sesame Yam Pudding, to Shredded Beef and Brie Tostadas, Salmon Cakes with Caviar Cucumber Chutney, and Cheese Souffle in a Pan, the beautifully illustrated Star Grazing will become an often referred to favorite for the family cook."
5,Amazing!,Alright whoever song this song is bad has problems. It's not one of the worst song ever written it is deffinetly one of the greatest and if you know that you don't like theis kind of music well don't BUY IT!
1,"Um, this is probably the worst song ever written","If not, it's definitely up there. ""Beating Heart Baby"" is just awful. Hard to believe The Automator had a hand in this ish. My ex used to play this song all the time and well ... there's a reason we're not together anymore. Go spend your hard-earned cash on something that won't kill your brain cells."
4,I have worked for this chef,"I worked for Chef Loubet in Bonnieux at his restaurant Bastide de Capelongue. He is a man who goes to extremes to have the freshest ingredients in his kitchen. He has thouroughly trained his right-hand man, Chef Julien Boutet, to accept nothing less than perfection in his kitchen.I received this book as a thank you from the chef when I left his restaurant. It is full of beautiful ideas, wonderful pictures, and recipes that are difficult for the average North American to reproduce (sometimes due to the ingredients involved, and sometimes due to the skill required).This book is a wonderful ""coffee table book"" here in North America, but reminds me constantly of the quality and freshness of food served at La Bastide de Capelongue. I am forever indebted to Chef Loubet and his assistant, Chef Boutet."
5,Remarkable cookbook!!!,"This book is a work of art (as are the recipes.) THe photographs are spectacular, the recipes are totally innovative, and the ones that I have tried have been a gastronomic delight! Truly amazing! Some of the ingredients are difficult to find unless you are fortunate enough to reside in Provence (I don't), but there are creative substitutions. If you appreciate cooking that revolves around shopping locally, or the appreciation of foraging for Mother Earth's bounties, if you are a true gourmet, or if you like to dream, you will love this cookbook."
3,Body Shop Cocoa Butter Lip Balm,"I LOVE the hemp lip balm from Body Shop, but it is no longer available. Th cocoa butter is O.K., but not as good for my lips. Additionally, at least one, if not both, containers did not have a protective tape like the hemp balms have in the past. Generally, I love all the Body Shop products. The hemp face cream is fabulous!"
2,Bad CGI,"The sharks (except for maybe 1-3 shots) were all CGI and all looked like CRAP. Perhaps in theater 3D it looked good, but not in 2D at home.The movie had potential. But the silly reasoning behind why the sharks were there combined with the bad CGI just made this movie bad. The first 30-45 minutes weren't all that bad and it was semi entertaining. I just wish we could have been invested in these characters, gotten to actually know them and like them. Its just a shame that it ended up being as bad as it was.If you can get passed the awful CGI you might like this movie."
1,Horrid!,"I'm a fan of the b-movie genre, but this flat out sucked. You might as well skip this, and go straight for Sharktopus."
2,Shark Night,I thought the movie was okay. The only thing I did not like was the resolution on play back.I is real bad. That goes for the other movie I purchased. Amazon needs to fix this. or don't buy.
3,Not too bad,"Somehow, for no good reason, two rednecks release a bunch of sharks into a saltwater lake and then watch the carnage as the sharks attack one tourist after another. Okay, they want revenge on one of them, but that really isn't much of a motive considering that she didn't do anything all that terrible.That said, it is a good enough bloody movie if you are interested."
1,Shark Night 3D,"Styled after the nautical terror of Jaws and its ilk, Shark Night follows the misadventures of a group of undergrads vacationing in Louisiana who are methodically hunted by various ravenous sharks who have inexplicably taken up residence in the lake surrounding the house. After one of the coeds is brutally mauled while waterskiing, the others make an effort to get him medical attention, which, of course, merely results in more death as they attempt to traverse the dangerous waters of the lake. Hampered by its PG-13 rating, the film fails to deliver the goods in either of the two major draws of the genre: gratuitous violence and/or gore, and gratuitous sex and/or nudity. Shark Night brings nothing new or exciting to the formula, so it's pretty difficult to make a recommendation out of it."
3,Watchable shark movie,"I agree with other reviewers of this movie that the shark CGI effects are terrible. Some of the action scenes in the movieare worth watching, such as the boat explosion and the scene with the woman in the shark cage."
2,Shark Weak,"Excuse the poor heading, Shark Night was a weak film overall. A group of college students go to a lake house to party and end up being the prey of deadly sharks. The story is generally generic even when the twist occurs; I personally thought the second half of the movie brought down the film the most since the first half was decent. It has some exhilarating scenes that were actually fun, but only SOME scenes really worked. I ended up hating most of the characters and the survivors are predictable from the beginning. The acting was okay, I personally thought Sara Paxton did a better job in The Innkeepers. The effects were also weak. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a horror movie because it wasn't scary at all.This movie has some gore, blood, and partial nudity (male and female). It kind of pushes the PG-13 rating, I've seen tamer R-rated films. Overall, I don't recommend paying for this film. If you must watch it, it's available on Netflix Streaming as of 6/22/12."
2,It Kind Of Bites,"Shark Night has plenty of cute shirtless guys, and a scary looking shark. Unfortunately, that's about the only positive things I can say about it. And the shark doesn't get nearly as much screen time as those three psycho's do, played by Chris Carmack, Joshua Leonard, and Donal Logue. The movie is mostly boring, especially when compared to 2010's Piranha remake, another recent big-budget killer fish movie. Piranha had awesome gore, a sense of humor, and lots of skin, which are things that Shark Night is lacking. See it on TV, if you see it all all."
1,A lower intestine product,"I love shark movies, and although there has been little produced about sharks that has been worth watching since the original Jaws was released, I will still go the extra mile to watch anything newly released that's shark related. I almost knew what to expect going into this from watching the trailer. Sadly, I didn't know it was going to be this bad. Sure I've seen some really low budget movies that turned out pretty darn good, so if you consider the budget they had to work with on this, it actually makes this one exceptionally bad flick. The acting, the story, the CGI, it was so depressingly poorly executed. How someone gives this anything above 3 stars is beyond me. It's so bad that I don't even feel like typing anymore about it. If you want to see a decent shark movie that isn't in the Three Stooges realm, watch ""The Reef""."
1,An Abomination... I loath this.,"I love sharks and i love cheesy shark movies but this was the worst movie i have ever seenthere are almost no words to convey the disdain i have for this wast of time.by the way the so called tiger shark wasn't even a tiger shark, it was a sand tiger sharks which are harmless to humansNo shark species eat people"
1,OMG,"I AM HORRIFIED!!! This movie was so horrible!!! I want my $4 back so I can rent something less gay like HARRY POTTER!!! OMG I was compaining the whole movie, how unrealistic!!!!! MORTIFIED!!! DISSAPPOINTED!!!!"
1,Wort shark movie ever,"Really this film is goddamn awfull, cartoonish sharks, horrible script and acting and the PG-13 rating are the film's main problems, and the only good thing this film had was the 3D, and there's only a 2D version of it. What a shame."
2,wait for netflix!,Rented this for $1.99 on special from Amazon video. Paid $1.98 too much. Wait for Netflix folks! Only nice part....Katherine McPhee is hot!
3,IT WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED,"A weekend at a lake house in the Louisiana Gulf turns into a nightmare for seven vacationers as they are subjected to shark attacks.First of allThis is not the typical shark movie where you could scream at the people and say how stupid they are to get back in the water. the story, plot and direction are well thought of and you follow the story ...&surprisingly also the black person doesnt die first too!!LOLBut anyway i have to say that this movie so real entertaining i watched it on dvd and just could have imagined howgreat it was in three-D!!!!Any body that likes a good thriller should watch this! it will have you entertained until the end!3.5/5"
1,Shark Night,I saw Shark Night on Dvd last week and it was one of the worst Horror movies of 2011.The plot was very weak and the acting was not much better.
1,PURE CRAP!!! WASTE OF TIME!!,"I was so hoping this movie would be worth watching, yet AGAIN I was wrong. The sharks in this movie were a total joke. The so called ACTING was much much worse."
2,Pretty bad,"I certainly hope that someone doesn't buy this film without watching it first. It is pretty bad and special effects are so-so. Acting is terrible, direction is worse. I watched it from netflex so I was lucky because I didn't buy it."
1,"Digital copy auth code has been used on supposedly ""new"" factory sealed bluray","Digital copy auth code has been used on supposedly ""new"" factory sealed bluray. Need I say more. Would like to review the actual movie, but will have to wait to get home. why bother with digital copies."
4,Under water i can be Dark,And in the night its even more dark what is good for the shark. This Move is bark and bite . Be cearfull what place you chose for Swimming.
4,Groovin' High review,"This is a great album for jazz enthusiasts and new jazz listeners alike. This album presents several of Charlie Parker's great tunes which have also developed into jazz standares such as, Billie's Bounce, Hot House, Ornithology, and Groovin'High."
3,limited usefulness,This book has more in common with a glossy gardening magazine than a book of either oriental style landscaping or zen philosophy. There's lots of pretty pictures (which you may find inspirational) but the advice in the text if fairly shallow. The connection to zen is a bit nebulous... and seems to exist mostly to add some sort of deeper legitamacy to the book.
4,Calming Influence,"This book is full of great illustrations, some of which I hope to incorporate in my own yard. It's informative and is comprised of thoughtful explanations of Zen styles. I'll keep it handy to re-read frequently."
4,Well documented,Duplicate information from now out of print works...but excellent historical accounts of the Bourbon story.Best read with a glass of 12 year old KY Bourbon!My recommendations:1 - Woodford Reserve2 - Four Roses Small Batch
5,Very Helpful,"I originally borrowed this book from the library, but I found it so helpful that I purchased a copy for myself to use as a reference. I am very new to grant writing and this book was a great read. It was surprisingly entertaining and very motivational. Not only did it explain how to write grant applications in a simple yet thorough way, it also gives you tips on how to write other fund-raising materials and provides great insight into the workings of a development office. The only thing I would want to see changed about this book is the part about email and the internet. This book was published in 2000 and I'd love to see the authors update that section to reflect the electronic resources available today. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this book to others who are new to the non-profit fund-raising world. Even if you aren't so new, the numerous tips and the Down-and-Dirty Proposal Kit at the end may prove to be very useful and help you improve your writing process."
4,"good book, good ideas","this is a great book. it covers a bunch of very interesting topics, including the meaning of the ""/"" in mind/brain. includes a lecture by chompsky + 3 responses by a phyisist, a psychologist and a neurosurgeon and how what they are doing relates to what chompsky says."
2,Hmm...,"I am disappointed. I got this for my son because I thought it would be a cute watercolor set for him to start out with (he's six). I was not pleased that most of the paints fell out of the holes right off the bat. Then, the colors are hard to mix and are pale and washed out, not rich and vibrant. The Crayola watercolor paints are better! I wish people would take kids more seriously. I want my kids to have awesome art products, not frustrating crappy stuff that does not get the desired result. I wish I hadn't bought this."
1,crappy machine work!,"I have 4 bikes with highlifter lifts. The one they sent was not the one in this pic or my pic. The holes were piss-poor aligned and needed correcting and the bracing bracket at rear clearly didn't align. My other two foreman lifts were fine, as well as my rancher and my former two recon lifts, but this was sadly misappropriated. And it took forever to get.Highlifter is great, but this must be a ghetto knock-off made in a sweatshop."
3,This is one of Sally's better cds........,This definetly is one of Sally Harmon's better cds. On this particular cd Sally played with a lot of enthusim. Her song selection was fairly decent. She did however play a mixture of classical and standard pieces. I would have preferred that Sally choose to play all of one kind of music instead of the mixture of songs.Sally continues to impress me with her great talent. She is one of the better painist that i know about. I am anxious for Sally to put out another in this series of solo piano cds. I will be at the head of the line to buy Sally's next solo piano project.I Would Like To Recommend This Cd
5,Service Excellence,"Great book with actionable ideas that I have implemented in my company and they are making a possitive difference. Even if you are not in a ""leadership"" position, by sharing these processes with your boss or even testing them on a small scale and letting others see the possitive impact, you will look like a star. Disney is not a huge success by accident.Bottom line: it all comes back to customer service. You want to keep customers or get more customers; get this book and don't be afraid to try what is in it."
3,Not up to Disney Standards!,"When I ordered this book, I was expecting to learn a lot about Customer Service. What I did learn a lot about was the Disney Institute. It seemed like the entire book was an ad for Disney World and the Disney Institute. While there are some great nuggest of wisdom, for a book from Disney, you would think this wouldn't mickey mouse around. If you want to Learn about Customer Service, there are much better books out there."
5,Inspirational and Practical,Our marketing and advancement team is using this book to further the ideals of our school. We found it both helpful and inspiring.
4,Excellent book especially for young or beginning writers.,"My wife purchased this book as a present for our granddaughter as a part of a present (scrapbook materials etc.) to encourage her to write and keep a journal.I picked it up and although I thought it would be elementary, I found a compact treasure of helps and hints and encouragements to write. In my view it's suitable for both a beginning writer, and as a matter of review and reminder even to more experienced writers. She generously give illustrations and examples to illustrate her points -- and although modern writers might be inclined to diminish her advice, I find it basic, foundational and above all, *encouraging* to a young (or old) writer to get started and write!"
3,"Good, but sometimes annoying","Donna Fletcher is one of my favorite authors, so I bought the book right away. Isle of Lies is a fairly good book, but... it annoyed me a little that Moira is five years older than the hero. She is 29 and throughout the book is referred to as ""old, barren"". I know she is considered old for medieval times, but still. Furthermore, she is fainting all the time. Once is enough, thank you. The story in itself was okay, but nothing special or original. I expected something more."
2,Not up to her standards,"I have read almost all of Donna Fletchers books. Normally it is easy to fall in love with the characters and feel like you are in the story. This book was very slow moving and left me feeling disconnected to the hero and heroine. I kept waiting for the book to pick up and draw me in, but every chapter seemed to disappoint immensely with the end making me feel empty and wanting a complete rewrite to add more substance to the characters and the very thin plot. I would recommend reading other books by the author, but definitely not starting with this one as you will soon lose interest quickly."
5,An awe-inspiring love story,"I have read several of Donna Fletcher's novels and have never found them lacking in the least. Isle of Lies does not disappoint, in fact it ranks as my favorite of all time. I fell in love with Moira and Ian from the start. I truly enjoyed watching their love for one another grow. Ian's concern over his wife's condition was touching. Moira was strong willed and determined, the way a heroine should be. I did want the story to end as I could have continued to read more about Moira and Ian. I anxiously await Brianna's story which will be out sometime in early 2003. Keep up the good work Donna. I am captivated by stories set in Ireland and Scotland - I do hope you continue to write more."
2,Isle of Snores,"Despite a great beginning, the plot of Isle of Lies quickly loses steam after Moira and Ian return to his home. ""Come quicky Moira has fainted"" seems to be the extent of the storyline for half of the book. Over and over again, she feels poorly, faints, is told to lie down, acts defiantly, repeat preceding steps. Moira's quest of knowledge could have been an interesting side story, but instead the author only applys non-specific references to Moira's concern for others finding out about her experiments. Perhaps Donna Fletcher should have engaged in her own search for knowledge and researched what advances in science were unfolding circa 1513. Chemistry between two people cannot carry a story for 150 pages, and it is precisely what is happening in this book."
4,Isle of Lies,Isle of Lies was difficult to put down. The story was funny but suspenseful. I have read many of Fletcher's books and enjoyed them all.
4,Liked it,"A war between two fierc clans breaks out costing many lives with no end in sight. To save his clan the chief rushes to a convent to trick the rival chiefs daughter into marriage. Moira is tricked by the warriors words and hurries to surrender herself to him. They marry quickly, consummate the union even quicker, then the fact that it was all lies becomes apparent. Moira's father shows up furious. He did not sanction this union as she was made to believe. He was very much alive, her new husband said he was dead. Starting out on nothing but lies,makes for a interesting relationship. Lots of twist and turns in this one. I've read it several times."
5,I want a sequel please!!!,"I love Donna Fletcher! Her books are not only exciting but the charecters are unforgetable. Not only the main charecters but the people she places around them. I know what your saying there is ""Love me forever"", I still want more! Her women are intelligent and care more for others than themselves. The battles are written so well you cannot put it down, before you know it, it's one a.m. and you have to go to work soon. The conversations between all charecters is written in a way that you feel you are right there in the room. Truly each book is a treasure. I pre-purchase every Donna Fletcher you should too, you will not be sorry."
3,"Good, but not the best","I liked this book, but reading it once is enough. If you enjoy historical romance novels it is worth the money, but buy it used."
4,Excellent starting point,"Oracle 8i for Dummies has two things going for it that other Oracle books don't. First, it sells for 1/2 the price of the others and second, it isn't 400+ pages thick. I was able to go through 8i, Enterprise Manager and WebDB within a day or two and get a good feel for the types of things that can be done. I haven't seen another book yet which would have helped me accomplish this.I have to admit that those reviews complaining about lack of depth or completeness are somewhat valid. However, if you want this, go get one of the 400+ page monsters. If you want to get started fast, grab this book.My strategy was to use this book as a starting point. I gained the experience to get around the most significant features with relative ease and I also learned which parts of Oracle 8i I really am interested in. I think that this book was perfect for this. Now I can get a more advanced book to cover the specific topics I need to dive into and expand my Oracle knowledge further."
2,So-So,I wish it would have included some basic installation instructions. I couldn't get past the starting the instance manager on these instructions alone.
1,Incomplete Introduction,This book was obviously written on a tight deadline. Complete omissions of topics such as triggers and sequences means you can't do much with Oracle if you only have this book to go on. Someone needs to write a book that helps the SQL Server / Access programmer delve into Oracle.
1,Trust but verify,"Beware of the writings of G. B. Lane. Before you blindly add his information to your own papers, confirm his research. Mr. Lane's first book, ""The Trombone in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,"" was withdrawn by the publisher after allegations of plagiarism. For more information, read the review in the Music Library Association journal, Notes (vol. 41, no. 1, September 1984)."
4,Great shirt,"I found this to be a high quality reproduction t-shirt. Straight Ahead is one of my favorite bands, I'm really fond of their material on the End the Warzone comp and the 12"". The lion artwork is a powerful image, and I think a skinhead drew it. I wore this to my little sister's birthday party and got a lot of compliments from her friends. Awesome shirt for any fan of ""Craig's Intro"" or ""Knockdown"""
3,should have kept dashing,"a very dull mystery, too east to figure out, okay for a quick read, but no excitement here, would not re-read"
2,Too many slips of the tongue!!,"If you have read other titles in this series, and you think Lee's slips of the tongue are ""charming"", you'll be delighted with this book. If, like me, you view them as very annoying breaks in the narrative, run for the hills. The tongue tangles are just over the top this time around, MANY more than in previous books. I enjoyed the earlier books despite the slips, but there are just too many to ignore in this one."
3,Note to JoAnna Carl - Stop ruining your own books!,"When the vast majority of your reviewers are telling you that they enjoy your books, except for Lee's tongue tangles, it is time for you to listen. This complaint has been made in reviews for all of your past books, yet the malapropisms continue. It is not a cute device! It detracts from the story, interrupts the conversational flow, and makes Lee seem like an idiot. I would enjoy your books so much more without them. Please have Lee see a Speech Therapist in your next book and dig yourself out of this literary hole you have created. Your fans will thank you."
3,"Nice idea, but it drives me nuts!","When my husband gave me a palm pilot for the holidays, he made a big deal of including this hardcase as well. While he's right that it might be better at protecting the device from getting banged up in my purse, I find that the cover doesn't really stay completely closed. It constantly bumps into the adjust contrast button along the top and can make beaming inconvenient.If you know that you have a history of being careless with your electronics and have reason to fear dropping or banging your palm around, then go ahead and buy this case. If not, you're probably better off with a soft case that doesn't cause the other inconveniences."
1,Very disappointing,I was amazed that this sells for over $[money]. I was fooled by what looked like a sturdy and attractive case. It is poorly made out of cheap plastic - I expected much better from Palm. It doesn't close properly and makes hotsyncing difficult.There are better cases out there.
2,Good protection on the road - operation and finish too bad,"The hard case for Palm V offers good protection while on the move. But during operation it is a nuisance. The contrast switch on top of the Palm is depressed by the hard case making it impossible to operate my Palm when it is resting in the hard case, overall handling is harder, Hot-Sync is a joke and finally the looks does not at all reach the finish of the Palm V itself. Where the Palm V is well thought out and well designed, the hard case is clearly an afterthought. Buy the hard case only for travel protection - personally I would not buy it again."
3,Almost there...,"I've been using this case for about 8 months now, and it's probably the best case I've seen so far. It's held up really well, and I don't consider the spring cheap. The aluminum plates on the outside are starting to show its age, however. It's prone to scratches and dents. Also, the Palm's surface coating itself is scatching off when dirt comes inbetween it & the plastic insides of the case. A lining for the inside would have been nice. I'm still looking for a case better than this in the meantime."
2,Cheap plastic with a little aluminum on the front...,Although it does add to the protection of your Palm...I don't think it is worth the price. It does look cheap and I was depressed about spending this much on plastic :-( I noticed the added weight immediately too...
4,Palm V hardcase,"I've used this case for about a year and am about to try a leather based one. For this case:The pluses are: Protects the case well, Relatively slimThe minuses are: The case often depresses the contrast button, Case wears a hole in the back pocket of my pantsI got this case after first breaking a screen in my original palm when it fell out of my shirt pocket. It has done a good job of protecting the device. It has been a pain when the contract button is pushed because several times the contrast has gone to all black (good luck trying to tap on the contrast bar to bring it back again). The other problem is that since it is a hard case, it wears holes in the pockets of my pants. My jeans have holes where the corners of the case rub. I'm going to try leather as a compromise. Hopefully it will protect the unit, but not ruin pants!"
1,Case snapped the first time I sat down.,"I just reviewed the Rhinoskin hard case, which I bought after this one broke in my pocket. This case is a pure 100% piece of junk. It's not aluminum like they claim, it's plastic! How do you expect a piece of plastic to protect your $300 Palm? I found out the first day I got it that you can't safely wear it in your pocket. I sat, and ""crack"" the case broke. I was tempted to return it but it wasn't worth the headache. I promptly ran out and bought the Rhinoskin (worth every penny) and never looked back."
2,"Okay, but totally not worth the money","I was highly annoyed when I pulled this thing out of the box. Here's a warning to all of you who think it's going to protect your Palm against everything: THIS CASE IS *NOT* MADE OUT OF ALUMINUM! I know it LOOKS like it is, but it's really a brushed aluminum ""finish"". The actual case is made out of plastic that feels like it could snap very easily. Furthermore, the case I got was defective and the spring closure doesn't work. I spent $... on this at the store and feel really ripped off.The case would have earned one star, but I gave it two for looking nice. At least that one claim is correct: it DOES match the ""sleek look"" of the Vx rather nicely."
2,"Looks nice, could be better quality","I bought this product because, frankly, it was the only case taht brought out the style of the palm V. When i first bought it, i noticed it was made of plastic and 2 thin sheets of metal. Everything works fine untill about the 3rd month or so into heavy use. The springs that controls the front panel no longer works, the exterior is tarnished, and the cheap metal plates are starting to become unglued. If you want classy case for less money, go with a slim leather case, otherwise there are sturdier cases out there. BTW it does do a good job at keeping the palm V from turing on by accident."
2,Not as good as it looks,"Quality is depressing,Spring to shut does not work, fit of case overall is very poor and most importantly not as ""Hard"" a case as I expected.Looks shoddy in real life!be warned"
2,Cheap-feeling and bulky,"I strongly dislike this case and regret buying it. It looks and feels cheap, and adds considerably to the bulk of the Palm V. With this case on, it feels like I have my old Palm III in my pocket. It does not close all of the way. It is not ""aluminum"", it is mostly plastic with a kind of aluminum skin."
1,Waste of money,It is truly flimsy and useless. Two cheap pieces of plastic that don't fit well are slapped together and sold for $30+shipping. It is completely useless - buyers beware. Mine is sitting on the shelf gathering dust..
4,Sleek & Compact,"This casing is all the above as compared to all soft counterparts available. Though it does not offer the required shock resistance, it is an ideal casing for those who would require the Palm V to be slipped in & out of pockets frequently. Spring-loaded to remain shut at all 'kept' times, the casing's spine that attaches itself to the Palm V is rigidly constructed, but is a pain to get it on & off the latter.A good investment overall."
5,Gave it's life for my Palm V,"In honor of my fallen case, I feel compelled to write this review. Several reviewers claimed the case would not protect their Palm...they were wrong. Mine found itself under the front tire of my car, and my Palm V survived without a scratch. The case took the brunt of the punishment -- it's history -- but the Palm came out of the experience only emotionally scarred. Obviously, I've ordered a new one. A great product."
2,"Looks good, but not tough enough...","My Palm contains my entire life, so protecting it while keeping it slim and portable are crucial. The ""hardcase"" did not last longer than 2 months before the side of the case ""cracked"". I did not drop it, but used it incessantly on a daily basis. The case is not flexible (no pun) for left-handers either, as there are preformed button moldings cast into the plastic. If you want something durable, portable and slim, I would recommend the Neoprene cases -- they also have a wallet type storage area."
3,"Looks great, quality okay","At first, I was surprised that the case did not close entirely all the way. It just shuts close, but there's no locking system. The spring on the hinges feel like they are going to give away after 6 months or so. The front half of case is already showing a bit loosening in the springs, where as the back half is holding pretty well (had for 3 months). I was originally going to get the Coach case, but decided on this since I don't have to deal with zippers and such. I also liked the way the case looks. Sometimes I carry it in my pocket, but since the case never fully locks in place, some lints from the pocket gets onto the screen. I probably will switch to the Coach case in 3 months or so since I figure mine will last until then (I'm not a heavy Palm user either)."
2,Not that great,"Don't be mislead by the pictures. This case is made of cheap-looking black plastic, and part of the outside has a thin layer of grainy (not smooth) aluminum. If you're looking for class look elsewhere. The cover that comes with the Palm V looks better.The biggest problem I have with it has been mentioned but not emphasized:YOU CAN'T HOTSYNC with the case on.If your Palm use is very Palm-oriented this might be ok, but mine is very desktop-oriented, and that means I have to repeatedly take the case on and off.Another minor annoyance: the case itself is just slightly larger than the Palm V. But there's a largish (cheap black plastic) hinge outside the case. In addition, the pin slowly slides out the top of the hinge as you open and close the case (at least mine does)."
3,"The best protection, but...","I bought this product because it fulfilled my two most important criteria - it's by far the best protection for my Palm V, and it had the best aesthetics. However, as a left-handed person, I was very disappointed by how the cover gets in the way of entering information. A Note to Industrial Designers and Engineers: Don't forget about 25% of your users! I also agree with the reviewer from Lake Oswego - there's no really satisfactory way to HotSync with the cover on."
3,How do you put it in the cradle???,"The Palm V Hardcase is beautiful, except for one small feature. It extends almost an eighth of an inch below the Palm itself. You have several Choices when you want to put it in the cradle. 1) Take it out of the case. Not really acceptable. 2) Close the front and open the back 180 degrees, push/hold the Palm in the cradle until the Hot-Sync is complete. If you let it go, it will disconnect. Passable but annoying for HotSync, useless for battery charging. 3) Put the cradle on the edge of your desk or table and open both front and back ninety degrees. Let the hard case hang over the edge. It works, but maybe a pillow on the floor would ease your mind."
2,Sexy but deceptive . . .,"The initial appearance of the case is striking, but, as another reviewer commented, the case is basically a piece of plastic. And, most importantly, the case provides absolutely NO PROTECTION for a unit dropped onto a hard surface. The hard case will not absorb the shock from even a moderate fall where the unit lands on an angle, resulting in a cracked screen (which is a $100 problem). My RECOMMENDATION is to purchase a soft case (Coach makes a good one) if you intend to be a frequent user of your unit."
2,Hard Case for PDA,"Does not fit PDA. Can not use stilius and the case together. Did e-mail company and have never heard from them. Unit is great for left handed person, but right handed will have a problem using it. I am left-handed so no problem."
2,What you see is NOT what you get.,"The hardcase pictured at amazon.com is in fact one of the hard cases originally offered by Palm for the Palm V or Palm Vx.But.The hard case I received from SF|Planet is NOT as shown in the pic! While the hard case received is all metal, what was received was of low quality and style compared to the pictured (original) Palm hard case."
3,Hot sync,"Yes, it is a little cheap by Palm standards. I still would not return it. As for the hot sync. I don't see the need for the support, ie. coffee cup idea. If you open the case to it's max, no problem, you just don't see the screen. But, you don't really need to see it during the sync. The info is on the desk top."
2,"Palm V may be a tool, but I've seen better toolboxes","I switched back to my original leather case after trying this ""toolbox"" for about a month. Hard case looks cheap to begin with, after a few weeks it also becomes dull and generally acquires a shabby look. In does not snap well - if at all. Opening on the top works fine for infrared sync and data transfer, but I can see frustration of those who have to do the cradle thing. This piece most definitely is not worth its price. Look at it as a sturdy plastic suitcase you take on longer trips to protect your stuff rough handling - not pretty, but serves the purpose. Just get everything out of it as soon as you arrive at your destination."
1,You need a saw and drill to make it work,"The only reason to buy this over priced junk is if you want fix the main design defect of the Palm V: it turns itself on if you push any of the 4 buttons on the bottom of the Palm.If you buy this case, cut off the back, and drill 4 holes thru the front then you can a) hot sync b) keep your V in a pocket without it turning on and draining the battery.I'd say you should save your money"
2,Disappointing,This case is definitely not what I expected from the pictures and reviews. It looks and feels very cheap and flimsy. The fact that it is impossible to hotsync while using it just adds to the frustration. Definitely not a match for such a fine product as my Palm Vx.
2,Nice idea but poor quality,"I purchased this cover to protect my palm. While it certainly has done that, it hasn't lasted very long. I have had it for less than a year and the hinge has already snapped. I don't knock it around - I keep it safely stored in a briefcase. But, I do use it a lot. So, I guess the sheer quantity of opening and closing put too much stress on it. Funny, because isn't that the purpose of a cover - to open and close? Big disappointment for this cheap piece of plastic."
5,"Great look, light and sturdy","How much would you spend to protect your $... palm? this case looks real good, and it fits your palm like a glove, adds very little additional weight and gives you the mental peace that your palm will be protected from about everything it could happen to it. Leather may look more stylish, but they are also bulky. A great buy."
4,Offers good protection,"I did a previous review on this case, which I liked, and just wanted to clear up a misconception I read by another reviewer.He said the case doesn't offer that much protection because it's just plastic with an aluminum finish. No. The case has real aluminum bonded to plastic, because one of the occasional problems I've heard about with this case is that the aluminum will sometimes delaminate and separate from the plastic.Aside from the occasional problem like that, I found this to be quality case. Although it seems little pricey when you first purchase it, it's worth it as it costs $100 to get the glass screen replaced by Palm if it breaks."
5,THE REVIEWER,"The palm V hard case is very nice, doesnt seem cheap or flimsy. Looks pretty awesome, i was getting tired of my palm and it has given the thing new life. I dont know why people say its not left handed friendly, im left handed and it works fine, the case opens 180 degrees and its pretty compact."
2,Cheap,"The palm V is both fabulously practical and stylish. However, this case feels and looks cheap. With this case, the pilot ceases to be stylish, and becomes as bulky as the Palm III."
4,good stuff,"This is a great product!Helps protect the screen, and solves the problem of your Palm Vx accidentally switching on.Only bad point, there is no place to store your business cards..."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT...,"This CD is made to look like it is by Antonio Bribiesca, which is what we wanted. However when you get it you'll notice that all the songs are played by someone other than A. Bribiesca. I want my money back + shipping. I hope they agree to do this. I will come back and post how excellent or poor the customer service is for this type of problem. Also, I certainly hope they change the way they are advertising this CD!--Rebecca"
4,30 Grandes Exitos,"A fine collection of Antonio Bribiesca music, but it does not sound quite like him. Later I noticed on the back cover a mention ""INTERPRETA:ARMANDO TREJO"" ?????"
2,Horrible Packaging,"Not necessarily reviewing the content of the DVDs - just the packaging. The boxes were all damaged slightly and as people have complained about other Matt Groening packaging - it's BAD. The DVDs aren't really in anything to protect them from scratching, just cardboard. I understand that this is better for the environment, but maybe Matt should invent some sort of packaging that is both environmentally friendly AND protects the DVDs!!"
4,Another Great Book In This Series,"Very simple, cute book that gets the message across quite well. Straight and to the point, as the other books in this series are."
3,"Nice case, soft, but thin, leather.","This is a nice case. It has several slots for cards (two of them are windowed) , a zippered compartment, a stylus holder, and a small notepad. There are also 3 compartments inside to store things like checkbooks. I like having the notepad handy in case you want to jot a quick note, then enter it into the palm later. The case stores the Palm snuggly, yet allows you to remove it quickly if you need to. One negative about the holder is that there is no access to the internal stylus holder. You have to keep a stylus in the case's stylus holder. The leather is soft and rich looking and it is very professional in appearance.My only complaint about this case is that the leather is very thin. The leather has worn away on the edges of mine after about a year's use. This is the reason that I cannot rate it higher than 3 stars."
1,Cheap quality!,This is a low-quality item. I originally bought it from a now-extinct online store. The credit card slots ripped and the cheap nylon backing ripped.Don't bother with this one.
2,Sloppy at best,"I saw the other comments, re: cheap leather, etc., but still thought I'd give it a try. Well, the leather is thinner than I even expected. More noteworthy in my opinion is that, even when the case was filled with travel cards, business cards, and the like, it was still designed to be thicker -- perhaps about 1/2"". The effect is that that the tri-fold and closures are loose and sloppy. It really wants to be thicker than it is when fully loaded. If it was filled with enough (??) stuff, it would be really awkward. I would not purchase it again nor reccommend it to a friend."
2,Such Potential -- Gone!!!,"I had so expected this item to be the answer to carrying my PalmPilot and incidentials. But alas, it was not to be. The case I bought was supposed to fit any III series, and I have a IIIC. It does NOT fit! Bummer!"
2,"Smells great, doesn't last","My girlfriend recommended this to me and I went out an tried it out at the counter and I really liked the scent so I purchased some. I put it on (one spray on each side of my neck) and when I got to her house an hour later she could not smell it on me unless she got really really close. It's weak after just an hour, thought it just be me, but seems like this is the biggest complaint on other sites.I've even tried 4 sprays on different parts of my body and it simply does not last. I even have the kit with body wash and aftershave, with all that she still could not detect it on me.The scent is great and I really like it, but I'll go through a bottle in a week if I have to keep applying every hour."
3,Also frustrated,"I'm with Judd from Roswell--you can't review this movie properly without seeing the director's cut, which I also have searched for IN VAIN. It seems the best release of this movie is completely unavailable. Without seeing the entire movie, it just seems too muddled and hard to understand. Sting has a great part, however."
4,From a big Dune fan...,"I give this four stars rather than five because of the serious plot changes. There is much in this movie that was not in the book. The Sci-Fi Channel version is much better on that count, but it was done on a lower budget and it shows. I assume that this DVD has the theatrical release. Those that have seen the TV version will note that there are many scenes missing on the DVD. On the TV version the colorization for the eyes was not done for the added scenes, and an intro with background info was added."
3,Frustrated,I have not seen this particular one but i am very frustrated because i cannot find the directors cut anywhere. Maybe if i knew where it can be located i would go out buy it and watch it and give a proper review of the version. If anyone can be nice enough to send me more info it would be much appreciated. I am a big fan of this classic. The last time i saw the uncut was on late night disney channel(where did they get it)
1,There's a better version,"Do not waste your money and time with this poor version of the great science fiction masterpiece, ""DUNE"". First, you must read the books, and than see Director, John Harrison,s TV movies, Dune and Children of Dune. These are superior movies and I highly recommend buying them."
1,Don't buy these,"The legs are not adjustable. They are way too tall for any standard sink. One of the legs had a big bend in it, and they are useless. I had to throw them away. I'm very disappointed and angered for not recieving what I order."
3,the very worst stranglers album ever,"The Stranglers,the very best band of the punk era.They now seemed to be remixed ,remastered in every form.This album has nothing new on it,all the favorites,no more heroes,walk on by,something better change.For an introductoin to the band,it is a good album,but for the fans I would say no.This is only for the diehard,hardcore,fan."
5,Best earplugs for sleep,"I lived in the East Village in Manhattan, with a bedroom that faced onto a busy street and a flatmate who loved watching TV at extraordinary volumes late into the night. I tried many different earplugs, and these were the ones that let me sleep through the night. They're fantastic at blocking sound, they don't fall out like some smaller-profile plugs, and they don't hurt the ear canal the way some large plugs can. Highly recommended."
5,Best earplugs that are widely available,"These earplugs are GREAT! I've tried dozens of earplugs to block out my boyfriend's intense snoring, but these really do the trick -they reduced the noise to below the threshold of a whisper. And they are really comfortable - my ears didn't hurt in the morning. I've recommended them to everyone I know."
3,Nothing Special,"I purchased these ear plugs after reading other reviews hoping they would keep out the noise. They aren't much different than other ear plugs that I have tried. They muffle the sound, but they don't stop the sound. For instance, I sleep with a fan on and I can still hear the fan. The ear plug is soft enough, it is like most others. Twist it , roll it and put it in your ear to let it expand, but it is not without some discomfort. I wake up a couple of hours after putting it in and my ear is uncomfortable. For the price, I was hoping for more. I say go to your big box store and buy what they have. Save some money/these are nothing special. Disappointed."
5,It Works,"My partner has several coughing fits every night. Each time it wakes me from a sound sleep. It even drives the dog crazy. Once she starts coughing he goes to a bed in a different room. I don't have another bed, so I had to find a solution.I researched ear plugs and decided to try these based on excellent reviews. I didn't pay a whole lot for them, and, frankly, doubted they'd help that much. I put them in last night. I run a sound machine all night, and I could still hear a slight hum from it. This worried me a little. However, after I fell asleep I did not wake up once due to coughing! I am thrilled with this product.These work so well that I didn't hear the alarm. It wasn't a problem because I was already awake, and the dog goes crazy when the alarm goes off. However, be aware of this."
2,"Difficult to read, expensive for no reason.","Pros: It's plastic, won't rust.Cons:- The fingering chart is completely non-intuitive, requires a reading element (as opposed to being purely visual), and requires the student's head crank over 90 degrees in order to align the chart with the flute.- If you are a new student wanting a fingering chart, don't get this one. The one that you'll find in any beginner's book (or even the one that came with the flute) is far more usable.This chart would be good for an instructor to post on the wall in class, only because it shows a life-size picture of a flute. And it points to where the fingers go when holding the flute - a good 30 seconds of use per student. At nearly a quarter the cost of a full-on book, it's hardly worth the money."
2,"Excellent idea, poor implementation. Not good.","The fingering chart inside of my book is far superior to this fold out. It is difficult to see whether you are going to use the Thumb or pinky keys with this chart, as they are not displayed! This is pitiful. My daughter who plays in the Symphony even remarked that this is a very poor fingering chart for beginners."
5,Greatest Chart Ever,I was really surprized at the quality of this product. It is made for heavy duty use. It is plastic coated to help prevent wear and stains. It's perfect for the younger player and a new learner.The chart is very comprensive with pretty much all of the fingerings.
2,Very far from Jungle Book 1,"This movie supports the theory that discourages producers from making part 2s. The story turns boring, and they went too far with the ""true lies"" approach, very far from the concept of the original movie.....not even my children enjoyed it."
4,Jungle Book,"This is not as good as the first one, but really, how could it be? I didn't expect it to be as good and you shouldn't either. The story line is a bit weak, but all the old characters (with new voices) are back with a couple of new characters (the girl and a little brother). The songs are just as catchy and both my daughter and I find we are singing along. She is 3 and loves the first one-has been watching it for 2 yrs. She did watch this on repeatedly when we first got it. She still watches it, but pulls out the original about 4 times as often. I'd buy it again because of the songs AND it still does offer a repreive from the countless Dora and Diego videos:)"
4,Fun for the Family,"After so many years between Disney's ""Jungle Book"" and the followup, it appeared to have been made with no interval; though our favorite actors who brought to jungle animation life were not in the DVD, it was a continuation of the first story and everyone looked the same age as in the original. I especially enjoyed the songs but now forget which was my favorite. The snake was still the villain plus the tiger which, I think, would scare small sensitive children. Seeing some Harry Potter early movies on t.v., some of those meanies would scare a child more than these animated songsters. Brett and Crissy were taken to see every one of them, but I wondered how she sat through some of the hard-core violence. This Jungle Book 2 is delightful and easy to enjoy."
2,No more Direct-to-video movies,"If you are going to make a movie, do it right. This effort is an embarassment to the wonderful Jungle Book. It has fine actors, so they are not to blame. They just don't have a movie to make, or a story to tell.Walt said it best, 'You have to tell a story. Without a story, there is no reason to do anything else.'"
1,Leaves A Bad Taste in Your Mouth,"If you haven't seen this, do yourself a favor and don't. I refuse to even buy it for my daughter, lest she possibly become instilled with poor taste. I was so upset after wasting money on it at the theatre that I wrote a nasty letter to my local newspaper for recommending it.Sequel's rarely exceed the original, but in this case that still left plenty of room for a good film. However this sequel is actually so bad that it pollutes the memory of the great original film. If Walt were alive this would surely make him sick to his stomach. Disney does a great job at snuffing out bad press but the smell of this one is so great they will certainly need to bury it..."
2,Why did this happen?!,"I love the 1st Jungle Book and watch it frequently. I definatly did NOT want them to make a Jungle Book 2. You can't just pin a sequel on a classic movie made nearly 40 years before! (They did that to Peter Pan and that movie was very stupid.) Well anyways, I saw the commercial and the voices aren't the same and the animation is DEFINATELY not the same. I'd personally just settle for the 1st Jungle Book re-release. I will probably see this when it comes to DVD because I like the 1st one so much, but I have pretty low expectations."
3,Dissappointed,I know shipping the product has a time set on it. But I was very surprise how long it took. I have ordered several merchandise from amazon and this was the longest delivery. It kind of makes you think the product was not being sent. I was more shocked in the condition it came in. DVD was very dirty and smudgy.
2,Not even close!,"Jungle Book 2 did not even come close to the first. You don't remember the songs when you walk out of the theatre either. It was a disappointment.Sher Khan was not supercilious, just mean in this one. Baloo was not as adorable as in the first. Bagheera was an ""extra"" in this one!! Mowgli was not as fearless as in the first one either! The characters had the same names, but were not the same.But ""Ranjan"" (the little kid) was cute though."
1,The Bare Neccesities (Do Not Include this DVD),"Uck! Sure I pretended to like it but this movie is horrible! It's not just horrible, it's CRAPTACULAR! Seriously! Why does Disney spoil us with Lilo and Stitch and Lizzie McGuire and then throw this crap at us without even asking, ""can we please release this""? Sure, ""Jungle Rythm"" Is 15% catchy, but it only accounts for 1/97 of the whole movie. It's not that I totally hate the movie, (that's a lie) it was just going back to school and hearing how cool Daredevil was, and how THEIR parents let THEM see it, and that I should see it, and that Jungle Book 2 is so dorky, and how they feel sorry for me, and that there's this cool part in the subway when... (this is when I sneak away.) Oh well, maybe I could watch Return to Never Land... AS IF! Blech. Blech. Double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, octa, yada yadaBLEECCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
1,jungle book 2,"The case for the DVD looked as though an elephant danced on it. It was smashed, plastic mangled, corners gone. The movie skips as you might expect, but thankfully only in a few places near the end."
2,mildly entertaining (2.5/5),"this sequel pales in comparison to the classic and much loved original.the story(such as it is)is pretty lame,and doesn't really have a point,and most of the songs are lacklustre.still,the movie was mildly amusing and had a few funny moments.since it was released about thirty six years after the original,some of the original characters from the the first movie did not have the same voice talents,which is a shame.anyway,in my opinion,they should have just stuck with the original classic,instead of releasing a lacklustre sequel.though,to be fair,this sequel is not as bad as many of the direct to video sequels that Disney has and will continue to churn out.so i guess that's something.then again,i don't feel this one should not have been released theatrically either.for me,The Jungle Book 2 is a 2.5/5"
4,Great Movie,"This is a very good movie that teaches about honesty and courage. It's simple, has some fun music, and is not too scarey for younger (3 years old) children."
4,Can new voices be accepted by the audience,"I spent the time reading the Publisher's review, which was very interesting and encouraging. BEWARE--when you get to the end you find something very common in these reviews. THE REVIEW IS OF A VERSION THAT YOU CAN'T BUY. WHY SHOULD WE WANT TO READ SUCH A REVIEW? IF PUT IN AT ALL, AT LEAST THE STANDARDS OF DECENCY WOULD PUT THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T REFER TO WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BUY. I have the original, and will very likely buy this one, but I resent having my time wasted reading a glowing review of something that DOESN'T EXIST. I will look at whose voice is used in major characters."
4,my son love this movie,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this movie. He dances and sings (and marches) with all the songs, and he loves the little boy. If you, as an adult, remember the original and are going to be annoyed about different voices, songs, etc., by all means, skip this one! But your kids will be missing out on a cute, fun movie. (To my son, this is an original!)"
3,Not as good as the original of course,"The movie was about what I expected from the typical sequels. Not as good as the original story-wise but my 2 year old son still likes seeing the same characters on the screen. It keeps him entertained for at least a few minutes at a time before he's off running around again. Honestly, do you buy this type of movie for the story or entertainment for the kids?"
3,"""Isn't it ironic that your name is 'Lucky'?""","One of the best Disney ""obligatory"" sequels. Nice continuity. It looks and sounds good. John Goodman and the rest of the new voice-cast do a decent job. The songs are so-so, catchy for kids. Plus, the plot is basically harmless. Nothing politically correct nor is it a guilt trip. The movie just tries to entertain the small fry, and it does it very well as my kids have made me sit through this movie no less than 30 times. Not to be overlooked, but nothing to scream about, either..."
3,A general overview of the subject,"This Discoveries volume, like the rest, was written with the beginner audience in mind, and for that audience it may well fulfill its goal. However, for a 176-page book it offers an amazingly obvious lack of information, perhaps because there are simply far too many graphics which do not support the text but merely illustrate the megaliths in question from various vantage points. There is little to be found on the subject of the stones' religious background, as well as anything about the culture of the people who erected them. At best, this book may be useful in acquiring the basic knowledge of the subject."
4,"I wish this puzzle was constructed better, but we love it anyway.","When my son got this puzzle for his 2nd birthday, I thought it would be a year before he could put it together. I was wrong! He is able to put the blue circle together himself and is starting to do the outer green circle. He has learned many of his numbers and letters by putting this puzzle together. We love it.Only problem, keep a bottle of glue handy at all times. The edges of the puzzle peel up! It is very tempting for my son to peel the ends. It is such a beautiful puzzle, but is a shame that it wasn't made to withstand lots of play.The pros do outway the con and I do recommend it. The thrill I hear in my son's voice when he says "" I did it myself!"" is worth it!"
5,Perfect Cookbook for the busy family!,"This cookbook is wonderful. It's recipes are not only easy to follow, but the ingredients the recipes call for are ones that are most likely to be in my pantry. The recipe is not afraid to call for a time saving ingredient such as a can of soup or a seasoning packet, so there's no ""Martha Stewart made-from-scratch"" guilt-trip going on here...It's also a great resource for party recipes and holidays. I can't recommend this book enough!"
4,Sander my Savior! pt 2,"A great follow up to his 'Everybody' disc set, Too, is bold, dark and what I'd consider, auditory heaven at times. This second set of discs has what feels more like a mix of daytime and nighttime tracks. Some bouncy, vocal and melodic - good for the day of the party (""Mindtrip""). Some trax could be found during super-dark 3am-6am sweat drenching aft hrs parties (""Seventh Morning""). Of course, like any compilation, you'll find a few tracks to be weak or fillers, but which those may or may not be are up to each lucky Sander listener.If you like music categorized as ""deep, dark, house"", then add this to your collection, Too! ;-)"
1,pop candy and devoid of any soul,"sorry to say...for true house enthusiasts, this entire album emits nothing but pop candy type house. While there are some decent tracks, they're just used to bridge to the next anthem. The vocals seem american idoled--and maybe the absence of them might actually improve some of the tracks. I did enjoy pieces of the first This is Everbody, but I bought the second one blindly because of that reason, and was thoroughly disappointed. Sander seems to be running toward the mainstream like Oakenfold and the rest. As soon as they get a loyal following their produced or supported tracks suddenly become hollow and extremely commercial. Seems that the best tracks out there never end up on mainstream releases like this...look elsewhere to satisfy your house cravings."
1,Who said that music should be in style with clothes?,"You are probably wondering what the heck do I mean by this title? Well, to answer your question I would say that Sander, Who used to be one of my favorite DJs, decided to through in some 80s style tunes to match what's hip in the couture world. Just think about it, wouldn't it be nice if people danced around in their 80s style clothes while listening to some 80s style house music? Although the idea might have been nice, the musical execution, on the other hand, was horrible.I really don't see what the hype is all about for this comp.Hopefully Sander's next release won't be so CHEESEY.Save your money, don't buy it."
4,"Solid Mix Album, great funky house tracks, top mate!","Everybody too obviously had to live up to everybody one, and I think that Sander did a great job of not making a follow-up to his first everybody disc, he simply just made two new style mixes for you and yours to rock out to. The first disc is (dare I say) a little trancey (progressive) and is just filled with hype tracks. Highlights are Mindtrip, DO to you in 82, and The Switch off disc 1. Disc 2 is a little bit more straight up house, but with the funky beats and grooves that Sander always drops. The fruit and ya don't stop are my fav's on disc 2.Both discs have a great house vibe to them though and are great for just getting down to before a night out at the clubs. 4 out of 5 only because it is not the best mix I have ever heard."
5,Fantastic new music,"This contemporary classical album is well written, well performed, and well produced. The music is beautiful (just the thing for that romantic evening if you ask me). The music is very atmospheric and deep, having the ability to ""take you somewhere else"". This is what Yanni or Tesh should be.I can't recommend this album highly enough."
4,Great documentary,"I like this. As a fan of wrestling, I see wrestling as a play for real life. Sometime we win, other times we don't but losing is not failing, it is only a stepping stone with winning to understand how to have success.This documentary shows how to compete to deal with pressure and defeat."
3,bad ethics,"What you should know about wrestling is the unhealthy pressure to ""cut weight"". Not 1 or 2 lbs but 20 to 30 lbs from your normal healthy weight. There is a price to pay later in life when you are cutting weight in elementary and high school. Look at Zeke Jones. A great olympic wrestler. But he was a scrawny little runt (118 lb) olympic wrestler. He is still an underdeveloped scrawny little runt. He should live in Hobittville. Wrestling promotes the worst ethics and should either have the weight standards reversed or eliminated altogether."
2,How but not why,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas 2004. She was a little too young for it at the time, but we have been trying to use in now. Yes, it tells how to build apparatus and yes, it has brief descriptions of how to setup and run simple experiments. What is lacking is a coherent explanation of why to do the experiments, why the experiments work, and what scientific principle is being illustrated. This book may be useful as an aid to teachers who already have introduced the scientific concepts to a class, but for a kid trying to learn by doing, it is sorely lacking. I was disappointed and so was my daughter.The perils of buying books on-line I suppose. If I had actually looked through the book, I would not have bought it."
3,I built the carbon arc.. and survived.,"I did manage to build a working carbon arc. Though, I nearly blinded myself, and burned down the house. This experiment was really fun, but is seriously dangerous. It involves taking a 110volt cord routing one side through a container of salt water, and basically shorting out the circuit through some carbon rods. It is INSTANT DEATH to any kid or adult that touches anything conductive. I actually used copper clad carbon welding rods from my grandfather's garage. I had to wear 4 pairs of sunglasses simultaneously, and father forbid me from using it unless company was over, then it was ok to impress them with it."
5,A crystal clear examination of the Cold War.,"An excellent book. Mr. Nixon spelled out the realities of the Cold War conflict, the true nature of our Soviet adversary, and the steps necessary to win the conflict and prevent the devastating consequences of full scale military conflict.The veracity of this work is borne out by the subsequent actions of the Reagan administration to call the Soviets' bluff and force the collapse of their empire.Even in today's post Cold War era, this book should be read not only for its explanation of our past but also for its additional guidance in dealing with the hazards of today. The lessons from this work shed a stark light on the current administration's actions in military and diplomatic affairs."
4,Blue Shift,"This is the first game from the Half Life series I bought so I cannot say anything about it being a great continouetion to the Half Life story. However, from the first moment the game made me not want to stop. It was something about the realism of it. I found the graphics to be great...Otherwise the game is excellent. I'm guessing it will run perfectly on pentium 2 since it ran on a pentium @166 at an average of 10 fps.Overall: 4/5Graphics: 4/5Sound: 2/5 (The voices of the people aren't that good even with the HD pack and you can't understand what they are saying)Gameplay:5/5*The overall score isnt' an average of the other scores. Gameplay is weighed the highest and sound the lowest."
3,Would be five stars if it offered anything new!,"Blue shift is a fun game, especially if you thought Half life was a little on the long side. The upside is that you get to explore more areas of black Mesa facility, and the XEN part is mercifully short.However, Blue shift is not much more than halflife with different levels, and the crossovers with the main plot do not come often enough. Another disappointment is that there are very few fellow security guards. The ones that are there are dead, inaccessible or mortally wounded.Overall, this is a fun game, but I suspect that valve are running out of ideas. Having said that, I'll be waiting with bated breath for half-life 2!"
1,Too Short,"What a disapointment. This game was too short. I figure maybe six hours of game play with it set on the the easiest setting. The scenery and characters were predictable, with no new additions or strange twists. Wasn't worth the money."
3,"Good game, but...","I was disappointed in Blue Shift due to fact it was VERY short. If this was longer, and harder to complete, I would be more content."
3,Good Idea That Ends Way Too Quickly,"Blue Shift is an expansion pack to the original Half-Life game in which you play a security guard who is forced to fight for his life once problems arise at the facility. The idea of playing a secondary character like a security guard is a great idea and for the most part this game does that well. Your character is not presented as some superhuman guard or anything, but just an 'everyday' guy with a few years education at a community college. The problem with this game is that it is over with way to quickly and so much more could have been done with it. I must also say that the ending is very lackluster and does not live up to the spirit and challange of the gameplay. Overall, I would say that if you enjoyed the original Half-Life and want to play it from a different viewpoint, give this game a try. However, if you're just getting into the Half-Life series then I recomend that you play Half-Life first."
2,*Pathetically* short,"I know some of the reviews here say ""Of course it's short it's just an expansion!, but even still I was disappointed at how little time it takes to complete this. Don't get me wrong, while it lasts you'l be doing a lot of the stuff that made the original so good, but seriously, given that you don't get stuck for a long time at any puzzle this game can be finished in about 5 hours.On the bright side though a couple of the puzzles are quite clever (especially one involving a dynamite plunger)I give this 5 stars for fun, but I can't give this product too many stars overall. Such a halfhearted effort leaves a slightly sour taste in the mouth."
3,rd,"Way too short for the price. I thought I was buying another of the half life series(lots of work and time), but this game was done in 3 hours."
2,blue shift,This game is an expansion for half-life that could have more time put in it. There are many downsides to this expansion. One is the game time its about two hours if you can play it really quick and few points were you want to take the disc and break it. Plus the lack of multi-player action and then there is no boss just a squad of grunts you have to run through or kill. When you play half-life you know there is a big difference in the difficulty and you get to play in an alien world where in blue shift you just look at Xen for 2 to 5 seconds. Basically Gear-box and Valve could have put a few more months in to it.
4,Great but short,"Another great entry for Half Life, as the security guard. But this game was short and I beat it in 2 days...I have NEVER beaten a game in 2 days. Still very good, just not very long."
3,The Low of HL,"The good: The game was just like predescessors Half-Life and Opposing Force - it combined all the greatness of the aliens and military, and made it extra creepy and stuffed with edge of your seat action, not to mention the extra very intruiging puzzles crammed in this game. Oh yeah, it's also got waaaaayyyyyy better graphics.The Bad: Short short short short short - way too short. It took me 3 days to beat it on medium difficulty. And the end (where most Half-Life's come out and shine with a great plot ending) was a serious let down.The Ugly: Maybe I hinted above, but the game really doesn't have THAT much of a plot. It's pretty much ""find buddies"" ""help em get the hell outta here"" while at the same time ""blowin enemies up one side and down the other""But it is still a good game, the perspective and story from the Security gaurd's perspective (or Soldier, for OpFor) is always a nice touch."
3,Buy for HD pack not for Game Play,"When you buy this make sure you are doing it to inhance and update the original or Opposing because this game is extremely short, and for a gamer like me it takes an easy 2 hours to beat. The HD pack is awesome, introducing new model weapons and texture inhancement. I enjoyed being barney but it was a short ride and now the game is in its spot on the CD stand collecting dust. Although after i put the HD pack on I found myself playing the original again, which also hasn't been played for several months maybe even a year. I guess what im saying is that it will respark interest in the original."
3,Get it for the HD Pack,"Blue Shift was way too short, and had no real variety of enemies. There were no bosses, no Black Ops, no difficult puzzles to solve, and a lackluster sound track. You might be wondering, why did I give it 3 stars then? Because the HD Pack is worth the money itself, by vastly improving on the models of the enemies and weapons in all official Half Life games. The HD Pack lets you go back and play the old HL games in a new light, it's worth it."
4,An incremental improvement,"The Half Life story just won't die. Any chance I get to see more of Black Mesa, I'll do it. The following technology that made Half Life and OpFor so novel has reached new peaks. The interactivity between Barney and a certain scientist is nothing short of amazing. At one point, the character leads you!It was rather short, but the HD pack and a standalone version of Opposing Force, coupled with the new point of view, makes it worthwhile."
2,Uninspired and way too short,"As a Half-Life fan, I must say how disappointed I am with Blue Shift. It's far too short (took me about 6 hours), too easy (no hard puzzles to solve), and limited in scope (you don't even see all the monsters or get all the weapons you do with original Half-Life). Is it worth the money? Barely. Even if you look at it as just a 'filler' until HL2, it's still very unsatisfying. If you're an HL fan, go ahead and order, but don't waste your time standing by the mailbox for it to arrive. It's just not worth getting excited about. INSTEAD try Gunman Chronicles (uses the HL engine) and actually drive a tank this time !"
2,Not worth it unless you don't have OpFor,"I bought this game for Blue-Shift, the abbreviation of which is, unfortunately, BS. This is surprisingly useful though, since this game essentially is BS. It seems like it might be cool, being a security guard, right? Being a mall security guard is probably more exciting than this game. it has some interesting sequences, but is is horribly short. Seriously. I took about 3 1/2 hours to beat it on ""easy"" THE FIRST TIME. No cheats/hints/strategy guide, either. I am not exagerating when I say it's too short. But it comes with OpFor, which PC Gamer put as 2nd runner up for Game of the year at some point. OpFor is much better than Blue Shift, so if you don't have Opfor, take a look. If you do have OpFor, look elsewhere."
1,"Blue Shift, a dissapointment","I can't believe this is actually a game. I've downloaded mods better than this!! Take my advice, if you want a great HL experience, get the Gunman Chronicles. It is cheaper and you won't be disappointed."
3,More Half-Life......just not a lot more.............,"Half-Life was fun, and it was llloooonnnnggggg. Opposing force was also fun, just not as long. Blue Shift is, you guessed it, fun.....but it only has about 3 hours of game time......3 HOURS!?!?!?! This is a retail product....not a mod. I feel cheated out of my money!"
4,One hell of a game,"I bought this game a few days ago along with the opposing force expansion and HD pack. Great graphics, superb gameplay and nice sound all go into one and 'WALLAH' blue shift, a short but tremendously fun half-life expansion. Opposing Force on the other hand lacks in its chills and gets a bit tired and repetitive after a while. The HD pack has some nice extras that make a tremendously great game an even better one.Thanx"
2,WHAT ITS OVER ALREADY,"that was my expression as I beat teh game...no end boss, no new weapons, this game just doesn't feel like opposing force or teh original half life, at 10 bucks I'd suggest buying it if only for the high res pack and a quick run through the levels, but the game itself isn't that good, its not much combat mostly puzzles until the last 2 levels.My advice stands as: Buy it if only for the high res pack packaged in but dont expect much from teh game."
3,Way easy,"I installed Blue Shift and then won it within a couple hours. Yes, it was fun, but it was way too small. There are only a few available weapons, and most of the challenge is devoted to navigation puzzles and pushing-barrels/crates puzzles. It is not worth the money. As an optional free download it would have been excellent."
3,OK Adiition to Half-Life,"I played this a couple days ago at a friend's house. It's the only Half-Life I don't own, so I wanted to see what it was like.Blue Shift is a good enough game, as are all the HL's, but I did have a few problems with it:1) No new weapons?2) Kinda Short3) The price- thirty bucks is pretty steep for such a short expansion. I would like to buy a copy of this, but I'll wait for the cost to come down, or pick it up used somewhere.If this game were ten or fifteen dollars cheaper, I would have given in 5 stars."
2,BLUES SHIFT,"LOOK HALFLIFE IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE VID GAME, OPPOSING FORCE IS WORTHY OF THE HALFLIFE NAME. BLUE SHIFT IS A ...,I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW SHORT THE GAME WAS.AT FIRST I WONDERED WHY THEY PUT OPPOSING FORCE ON THE CD, NOW I KNOW IT'S TO LESSON THE SHOCK OF BEING FLEECED."
4,HL BS is good.,"HL BLUE SHIFT IS GOOD GAME. A drawback for this game is that it is very short compared to the other HL games. How ever, It makes up by adding OP Force, the first expansion for HL which is LONG GAME"
1,Valve is dead!!!,"True! Bluse Shift is exactly what its name says, Bs. Valve knows how to squeeze milk out of a dead cow, but you can't blame them, for they are Bill Gates' students. This game is absolutly lame. Nothing new, all recycled stuff. High definition pack will update 3 years old graphics into 2 year old graphics."
1,Yawn! Played out!,"although this game is being sold under Half- Life it is so boring, it took me 35 min. to complete it. Like the review above says the 3d engine is old and played out. Everyone else is releasing new 3d engines, and this company is still working off of this 4 year old engine. The game is short and boring. I think barney should have been put to bed before they thought this one up."
1,Shortest lastling game in history of all games ever played,"I got this game for Christmas, it took me 45 minutes to complete. It was like a shareware at retail full game prices. All I have to say is this one is real bad. Get Op-force instead."
3,What updated graphics?,"I expected alot more improvement in Half Life and Opposing Force from the HD pack than there was. Characters certainly don't look any different. Blue Shift is a fair game. Nothing overly spectacular, though. Wait for it to be sold at a discount before you buy it."
1,Too Short and awful,"This game was not only short but stunk, I think that MODS and other downloads on the internet are far better than this, I think is stinks! If anything I think this game will hurt the sales of newer updates to H-L if this is what we have to look forward to. Sierra puts out garbage all the time."
1,why i didn't like it,"when i saw this i thought it would be cool. then i played it and it seemed kinda boring in the begining, but i thought all games aren't the best in the begining. so i played, played, played, and played and it stunk! i don't get why you have guns when theres just people missing there bones. and also the controlls where the WORST and too hard to control. in a nutshell the game stunk, and i don't think you should get it."
5,Blue Shift kicks!,This amazingly cool game was originally on te Dreamcast. It's fast paced action spawned a PC port. this game is another legendary addon for Half-life. It is truly a work of art. Thanks Gearbox!
1,This game stinks to put it mildly,"I think sierra (the makers of blue shift, along with Valve) have some nerve selling junk like this. This has to be the worst game I ever bought. The 3D engine is old and played out, the graphics stink and are old. NO NEW WEAPONS, nothing is new, its just plain and old. A waste of money and time. But Max Payne it might cost more, but more fun, 3d Realms never lets us down. As for Blue Shift, if you do buy it and have any problems runnig it, dont bother calling tech support, they will just be nasty to you, like they were to me. and if you are offered a rebate offer on the box, good luck trying to get it, they dont honor it."
3,Paying the phone bill,"Blue Shift is more of the fantastic Half Life series, but not nearly enough. It's over way too quickly -- I repeat, way too quickly -- though what there is is, as usual, super At the end, I had the uneasy feeling that gearbox and VALVe, co-creators of the great Half Life sequel, Opposing Forces, made Blue Shift secondly to satisfy the insatiable appetities of Half Life fans, and firstly to pay their phone bills. Thirty-plus bucks is a lot for so little. My advice: wait till the game goes on sale."
2,Dont Blink!,"Dont blink! By the time you open your eyes the game will be over. I was so excited by this new half-life release that I placed an advance order, and I am really dissapointed.If you are familiar with the half-life series you know what to expect. Great graphics, great story line, and of course great fun. However, I think that the guys over at sierra have a lot of nerve considering the length of this game.I am not someone who sits for hours and hours playing, Nevertheless, I finished this game with in two days. If you dont care about the short ride than I suggest you spend the money. On the other hand, if you are like me, and expect to get what you pay for, than hold on to your money and get a game thats worth the money, such as Deus Ex."
3,HL Blue Shift - In the dark.,"Blue Shift doesn't do justice to the HL series. There's nothing new in weaponry or enemies, and there's only a limited selection of weapons overall. There are a few clever things done in the game (I won't spoil it for those of you who still plan on buying), but nothing to compare with HL or OP4.By far the thing that bugged me the most is that I had to use my flashlight for almost the entire game. I'm not kidding. Almost every part of the game was dark and drab. It was very disappointing.The game wasn't very long, either. Definitely shorter than OP4.On the flip side, the game does give you a peak into Black Mesa again. Plus, the HD pack that comes with it does give certain enemies/items a new look that's kinda cool.On the whole, I was disappointed."
4,Good but Half-Life is better,When i bought Blue Shift i was really happy. I installed and began to play. The game was really good except for the fact that it's 1/4 the length of half life and you hardly get any contact with other people besides the army. I would recomend that you buy this game but if you don't own the original Half life buy that first.
2,Short and not too Sweet...,"I am a Half-Life addict. I will admit that I did support the game tooth and claw whenever I heard a dissaproving grunt from my friends.So why did I rate this game a measly two?!It was short. Everyone was complaining about Op. 4's unsatisfying length, well then, now you've got something to complain about even more. This is more like an overnight game than a month game like the first (and in my opinion, best) Half-Life.Sierra and Valve have been relying on the popularity of Half-Life to get them more cash out of expansion packs. The companies don't put as much time in their HL games anymore. Bl-Shift is just a few small levels put together in hopes of a fatter wallet.The graphics were not spectacular either. If Valve wants a better game they need to spend a little more time on it. I was downright dissapointed."
3,Needed More Bang For The Bucks!,"This game needed to have more to it. A LOT more to it. The ending of Half-Life was spectacular, even though I HATED those Xen levels. The ending for this is weak, not terrible, but weak.They needed to add some new monsters and I wish they had dumped things about Half-Life I didn't like. Like lose the headcrabs, the Xen level, and add some new monsters and a better ending. And hey, how about using some different actors for the scientists and other guards so they don't all sound the same?All in all only a decent game at best. Sierra should just release the Maverick Developments Wanted! add on instead of this. Wanted! needed a better ending too though, just like Blue Shift. You can did that, can'tcha?"
4,Too Short,I have waited for thiis game for over a month. The graphics do come to my expectations. The sound is supurb. The HD pack makes the Half Life collection even better. The only problem with Blue Shift I feel is the lack of game play. For even some of the least experienced game players they could beat it withen a day.Due to its shortness. Since it includes OP For I gave it the rating of 4 stars otherwise it would have been 3.
4,Blue Shift....Orginally filler for the Dreamcast release..,"People, you must realize something. Blue Shift was originally intended to be nothing more than a FILLER EPISODE for the Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Thats all. When they recieved a substantial amount of feedback, they decided to release Blue-Shift on the PC. Since it originally was just filler, they had alot of work to do to make it equal to a retail expansion. In response to the comment that Valv should work harder next time..they worked pretty hard on this one, actually. They beefed it up from what it originally was."
2,It's a Bust!!!,Wait until this comes to the discount shelves or try it our first. Very short no real benifits to buy this game. Want a good action game for free check out Infantry. http://www.infantryzone.com/ Much better play and graphix and best of all it's free.
2,Over already?!?,This game has the same feel as the first and OP but could they have made it any shorter. I finished the whole thing in less than 6 hours. I dont know about you but if I'm paying for a game I should get more use out of it that that!
2,GET OVER HALF LIFE,"This game is almost exactly like the original half life, but ten hours shorter. The game starts out in a tram(sound familiar) and then all hell breaks loose down at black mesa for an unkown cause. Im sorry, but I do not think that the original half life is even that good, so when this expansion pack came out i was not that excited for it. Though I wasn't that enthusiastic I picked it up, and once i started playing I officially lost my taste for all half life games. Even a novice gamer could finish this game in a matter of 4-6 hours of casual playing. No complex puzzles, terrible sound, terrible graphics even with the new high definition pack, and way to much of the slide effect when walking. Overall this game is short and leaves gamers unfulfilled, though it does contain opposing force, i still feel the 30 dollar price tag is way to much for a game with uncountable faults."
3,not worth it,a good dvd but not worth it unless you need the motivation to do higher inclines during a workout. The rest is a waste. lounges on the treadmill and light arm exercises are best done with better form on the floor.
3,harmless entertainment,"A young woman takes her dream vacation to Paris with her best friend and her step-sister. The trip doesn't go as planned, and then she is mistaken for a wealthy heiress. The three go on to connect with hunky guys and vacation in luxury. In the end, they may learn something about themselves. This is a harmless film that just about anyone can enjoy. It is predictable, and does not contain any great dramatic moments, but it has an attractive young cast and the movie's target audience of teenage girls will find it entertaining. I would recommend this one if you are in the mood for some lighthearted entertainment."
3,"My Daughter Enjoyed, But Overall Just So-So for the Genre","My 7-year old daughter did enjoy this movie, but I felt it was just so-so for the genre. I would put it in the same category as the Princess Diaries movies, except instead of Anne Hathaway as Princess of a small European nation, this stars Selena Gomez as a recent high school graduate from a small town in Texas, who is visiting France with friends, and upon being mistaken for an English heiress, decides to go with that and impersonate her for awhile, in order to enjoy the lifestyle. The plot is beyond ridiculous, but of course so are the Princess Diaries plots, but somehow I was able to handle that. This one just seemed really hokey - more like a TV special. The performances are fine, and setting is lovely, and it's all very cute and (mostly) harmless, but it's not one of the better 'girl flicks' out. If you're having a sleepoever of girls 7-11 or so, this would probably be very popular, but otherwise, skip it."
4,Selena Gomez,"It's the second movie Selena has done that it's from Disney and I think she is doing very good. The only problem I have with it, is that it simes that every Disney prinsess has to make a movie where she is playing two people. And I think that's a shame.But like I said Selena Gomez, is doing great is this movie, she really shows the world that she is so much more then just a Disney prinsess.Cory is also good in this one, I've seen him in Glee and seeing him in something else is amazing. You get to she him as someone else for a change and he is doing is amazingly.All in all everybody is doing a really good job.I would tell you to see this movie, if you're a fan of Selena or some of the other stars in this, or if you like a good laugh, love, romance and sisterhood."
3,Not much to say...,"The movie was so-so, but definitely not worthy of the current 4 star rating. It's one of those scenarios that has been done to death already. What is worse...there is no explanation as to why the lead character has an identical body double without being related, cloned, or having had million dollar plastic surgery."
3,Where is it?,Sorry but need to share that my movie was suppose to arrive 11/15/11 and today is 11/28/11 and I'm still waiting for it.
1,Monte Carlo,"Monte Carlo is very obviously targeted for a specific demographic. It's a travel movie about three young girls who plan a dream trip to Paris, only to be whisked away in glitz and glamour to Monte Carlo when one of them is mistaken for a wealthy heiress, and it stars Selena Gomez, Leighton Meester, and Katie Cassidy. It should, therefore, surprise no one that the film was predictably sweet and charming in parts, and completely riddled with formulaic clichés in most others. What we have here is a piece of fantasy fiction for young girls who dream of being princesses - or, at the very least, treated like princesses - so you can take that for what it's worth and decide if it's right for you. What I can tell you is that I wasn't so impressed by it, but let's be honest for a minute here: are the girls who will watch this really going to care what I have to say about it?"
1,Won't play,"We could not get the blu-ray disc to play on any of our blu-ray players (we tried 2 different discs on 3 different players), so we are returning it. My daughter is very disappointed."
4,It was fun,"I have been avoiding to watch this movie for a long time, I am just tired of seen just a bunch of pretty girls with no talent and acting skills, but this movie got to be more charming and fun that I was expecting. The girls did a great job, yes it have the same story, girl gone to Paris, meet handsome guys fall in love, etc... but it wasn't just about that. It was more about growing up and letting things go, finding yourself. And it have a good touch of comedy and fantasy. They are good actresses, I think they did a good job and make the movie enjoyable. I really like it."
4,cute movie,This is a very cute movie for all family members to watch! You can't say that about most movies.We enjoyed this movie.
4,Charming,"This was a charming, light, chick flick. Selena Gomez is utterly charming as a warm-hearted, earnest Texas girl who is visiting France for the first time with her lively friend and stiff step-sister, when she is mistaken for a wealthy heiress. The roles are well played, and the love interests are well cast. It is a bit formulaic, but it is a romantic comedy. The scenery is beautiful, the boys' Australian and French accents are real, and I particularly enjoyed the three romances involved."
5,Fun and Entertaining,I bought this movie for my 10 year old daughter for Hanukkah and we watched it last night with my 8 year old daughter. We loved the movie so much that we are watching it again this morning. It is funny and entertaining as well as appropriate for my girls to watch. I do not believe their was any in appropriate language.Selena Gomez did some great acting and made me laugh throughout the movie.
5,Monte Carlo,"I received quickly, good quality. This is a nice movie with Selena Gomez who is wonderfull and funny. I'm french and I really like the fact that the story has beek filmed in Paris and Monaco. Ihave a great time watching this movie"
3,Mediocrity,"I bought this for my daughter and I usually can tolerate her movies pretty well. This one was just below the line even for this type of movie with my already low expectations. Not the worst one I have seen though. Best of luck on deciding to watch this ""film""."
5,Amazing!,"This movie is perfect for every age. It may be only the leaning side of girls, but is a great date movie and has lots of laughs and charms."
3,How 3 girls have a moment of fun in their lives,"I found this movie fun to watch; I wanted it to be me experiencing the trip to Monte Carlo, and enjoying life for the moment as these 3 girls did."
4,Princess Diaries: again,"This was a pretty good movie besides kissing and REALLY immodest oufits. It was also princess diaries again: in a way, that it. You see it's about Grace (selena gomez) and her step-sister I think and best friend who go to Paris because they want to take a ""break"" sort of, but they end up in Monte Carlo because she's mistaken for the princess person of Monte Carlo. It's pretty interesting, but it's a little like princess diaries. and there's lots of ""un-reasonableness"" in it, but it's a pretty good movie."
2,silly,"Why does anybody fund and produce such silly stories? This is a conventional mistaken-identity bit of silliness, a sophomoric fantasy of a dream vacation."
5,"If you love dogs, you'll love this book!","The 26 stories in this book by the late Gene Hillare exactly what the title says. You will eitherlaugh or cry over each one. Fortunately, there is more laughter than tears. If you have ever had a dog steal your heart, you need to read this book you won't be sorry"
4,One with an open mind,"When listening to instrumental music, one should be able to relate the emotions of the song with the title.This release is one that keeps you in tune with the tune.""Open Mind"" is confirmation that Jean-Luc is a master violinist."
2,Definitely one of Ponty's worst album,"Anyway, he told us to open our mind for this album and I did it before listen to this album. But it seem not enough... I'd rather enjoy some of his electronic focusing like ""Individual Choice"" or ""Mystical Adventures"". Therefore, I'm still his fan."
2,Not his finest moment,"While there are a couple decent tracks on the album, most of it has an annoying repetitive quality. The 1980s were a low point in fusion music and ""Open Mind"" is no exception. Mind you, I'm a huge Ponty fan, but not to the point of blind loyalty. The best thing on the record is George Benson's guitar solo. Unfortunately, it's played over an endless three note bass pattern. With the exception of 'Solitude' and 'Watching Birds,' that's pretty much how all the songs go. Maybe it seemed like a nifty idea back in '83, but I don't think I would have felt any different then. Give me live musicians and interesting structures, please."
3,Tester,"Maybe because it's a tester, so the fragrance won't last for even an hour. Next time I'll buy the real one."
1,Terrible in all respects.,"Hillary is a self-serving bigot, unworthy of his fame. I was always weary of Hillary, reading this book sealed it. He constantly bad-mouths the porters who took him to the various summits of Nepal (other than Everest); he is always quick to point out he was 'first to wake'; 'first to lead'; etc. The book was published in 1955, two after the ascent. During that time, Tenzing was receiving more fame than Hillary. Jealously took root to write this terribly constructed book.Recommended, however, to see just how self-righteous Hillary is.P.S. Hillary didn't summit Everest first - Tenzing did (or perhaps George Mallory). Also, the cover of the book is not of Hillary and Tenzing on the summit, as some believe. It's at Camp XI."
4,Exciting mountaineering tale,"It seems to me that Hillary's account of his Everest summit is honestly written. I found his writing style engaging, not because it was good, per say, but because it seemed to be a normal guy saying what he felt needed to be said. His style and opinions were very 1950's, and I don't think he meant any harm to anyone, sherpas and whatnot. I liked it. The fact that Hillary never saw a mountain until he was 16 makes me think I have a shot at Everest someday..."
3,I Enjoyed It But Not a Keeper For Me,"An entertaining romance featuring a real woman for a change instead of a single digit clothing-sized Barbie. I read this after reading ""Immortal Warrior"" and the contrast in writing styles shows the versatility of this author. This story has realism (dealing with lost luggage), comedy (using her big bosom as storage), and a little suspense (who IS that man with the dreadlocks?) Like another reviewer, I thought an entire year's separation before the couple got back together wasn't credible since there was no contact between them in all that time. However, if you're in the mood for a quick, easy to read, amusing story, this is it."
4,An informative autobiography from an expert on Japan,"Even though this book is out of print, I was lucky enough to find a copy in a bookstore in Sapporo, Japan. Anyone who has lived in Japan or has an interest in Japanese culture will enjoy Mr. Reischauer's autobiography. I wish I could have met him in person."
4,Super -- but cover creased,"Actual pages: great condition. Cover: creased and worn. Overall: satisfactory, but I did expect a cleaner cover."
3,Acceptable pen,"Easy to set up. Easy to take down. The only limit is that the individual sections do not lock, so the pen can be disrupted by even small dogs. My 2 Jack Russell puppies can practically move across the room by pushing each secton. They must study & develop a plan!"
5,Quality product,"Nice, heavy gauge wire...quality construction. Works well at giving our 10 lb dog a safe place to run. I bought 2 of them and connected them to give the dog a larger area to play."
5,quality product,"We looked at several other makes of this style x-pen and found this to be the highest quality for the price. On several of the others, the joints/welds were sharp and unfinished. We use this all the time for closing off a room, confinement/safety while outside and bringing as we travel to ensure our doggies are good house guests.The simplicity and relative light weight of the pen is the beauty of it, as it affords easy and uncomplicated mobility.With a little common sense and ingenuity, a person can easily figure out a way to keep the panels locked into the desired angles of their choice and a method to hinder the caged critters from scooting the pen across the floor."
2,Not sticky enough!,"The stickers and pages are great illustration-wise. My son loved this book, but we've had to get rid of it because it was too frustrating. The stickers are very low tack and in theory can be moved, but in actuality will never stick to another page very well once peeled off. We lost my son's favorite sticker - the yellow street sweeper - because it didn't stick to the page, and it was upsetting to him. I wouldn't recommend this book unless they make the stickers stickier! For my son, stickers that stick well are more important than being able to move the stickers once placed."
2,Stickers do not stick,"I noted that another reviewer said the stickers stick well; but are then hard to reuse. We had a different problem: Our stickers in this book did not stick at the time of first use. This made it virtually impossible to enjoy the activity. I was constantly pushing down the stickers as they would curl up on all sides. My son would go for the next sticker; and the last one he placed would be curled. The art/style of the picture scenes and stickers are terrific; but the stickers are crummy. There are so many truck/digger sticker books on the market; pass on this one. Even though it's inexpensive, it's simply not worth it."
3,What little boys love,I got this for my grandson when he was about 4. TRUCKS TRUCKS TRUCKS - what more could a little guy as for? Fun to interact and place the stickers.
2,missing tape end sensors,i have this vcr in my shop right now and it's missing the tape end sensors. it will play just fine unless you're starting at the leader tape which is clear. this may just be a manu. fluke but other than that it's got a pretty good pix and good hi-fi.
3,"Nice wading staff, but carrying pouch below par","I used my new wading staff last week. The staff and handle were just he right size for my tall frame. Occasionally, when the staff was stuck in mud, it would separate as I pulled it out. I learned to twist the staff a bit to overcome that issue, which I suspect happens to many multi-pieced staffs. 4 out of 5 stars for the staff.The carrying pouch, however, is poorly designed. The placement of the clip is at or below the center of gravity of the staff when inserted into the pouch with the cork handle at the top. Several times, the pouch tipped on its side and the staff fell out into the water. The clip really needs to be at the very top of the pouch to prevent spillage. I may return it and request a refund if I find a more suitable staff and pouch. Only 1 out of 5 stars for the pouch."
5,Fleming - DVD Sacred Songs - Mainz Cathedral,"Song selection - admirableVocal performance - Superlative, as you can nearly always expect from Renee Fleming.Support performance - Very Good.Setting - Excellent."
3,European product!,"The picture shown is not the exact product that is shipped through amazon's fulfillment from ASAPbeauty. See pictures I uploaded that indicates that this is the European version of the OSIS+ thrill 3 product (multiple language label, made in italy, AL can designation, measured only in ml and different ingredients/formulation). This product seems to have slightly less hold, and has a slightly different fragrance than what you buy in the salon here in the USA. If you do not mind slightly less hold for less money, then go for it! It is not the same product though. I gave this item 3 stars because it is misleading. I have no real problems with the product, but I will probably stick to the salon-purchased version after I finish this can because I need more hair control."
3,New isn't better,"This product works in the same way as it used to (quite well), but the smell changed, and now it's much girlier."
1,Streaky hair,Just beware - if you have dyed dark hair it WILL strip the color out - I use(d) it for my front fly away hairs and its ORANGE now. My hair was dyed two weeks ago and now needs to be redone.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this because I used some over the holidays that belonged to my sister. Even though this was described exactly like her's, the consistency is too thick and sticky. Would return it if I could."
5,fav styling aid,"OSIS Thrill Fibre Gum 3.4 ozI use a smidge of this gel/cream styling pommade, warmed between my hands, and then apply it throughout my short hair for a soft-sculpted, super shiny look for my silver hair. Use more product for a more punked-out look.Pleasant fragrance and this little jar lasts for months of daily use."
1,"Overwhelming, sickeningly sweet smell","I used to drive past a candle factory to and from work. I don't know how the people who worked there dealt with the strong, perfumy smell because just driving past the factory on certain days gave me a headache. OSIS Thrill smells almost exactly like that factory, and it's just as overwhelming. The only time I used it, I wondered if it would weigh my hair down, so I tried a VERY SMALL amount. I smelled like a cheap candle until I washed my hair over 24 hours later. I didn't see any styling benefits, but I assume it's because I didn't use enough. Or maybe the smell blinded me to the styling power of the product. Or maybe it killed off so many brain cells I wasn't capable of noticing any improvement.I'm a HUGE fan of other OSIS products (Schwarzkopf Osis Dust It 10 gmcomes to mind), so I'll stick with them. This one was donated to a deserving friend. I hope she forgives me."
2,Not what I expected,"I was big fan of Schwarzkopf for a few years now but I haven't used it for a while. I decided to buy this one cause it was priced a few bucks cheaper than what I remembered. Anyway, the stuff is not what I remembered. It now comes in light red color, smells different, and worst of all, has a very weak hold.If you have unruly hair that needs a strong-hold product to keep in place, this is not the product for you."
2,Wrong product.,"The picture is not the product you receive - they need to update the product and description. The color of the actual hair product you receive is pink, not yellow, and has an entirely different scent and packaging than the original product pictured. It also seems to have slightly less hold than the stuff that came in the packaging in the picture. This picture / listing needs to be updated as it is inaccurate."
5,Excellent Tap and Die and Good Price,This was an excellent value from Amazon. I have already used it several times and it is very well constructed. I have become a fan of Gearwrench because of their build quality. This set is very price competitive and it will not disapppoint the home user.
5,Great quality,My boyfriend is pretty picky about tools and had been struggling with some cheaper sets. I found this one recommended on a forum and was very glad that they pieces have been working exactly like they're supposed to. No problems with them messing the existing problem and making it worse.
5,A great christmas present,My boyfriend has wanted a this set of tools since I met him. He was so excited to get them. They were exactly what he wanted. Thanks for making a great holiday.
2,Poor quality taps and dies,Quality of the metal was very poor. Pitted which resulted in jagged cutting surfaces. Would not even use them. The ratcheting handle etc was superb. Excellent quality.
4,Great Tap & Die Set,Received the product very fast. Have used it and worked great. Very good selection of sizes. Well worth the money!
3,Just fine,"This was my first Traviata and I remember that I was a little bit dissapointed. I mean, soloist like Sutherland, Bergonzi, and Merill, that must be perfect. Normally it would be, but not here. I use to love the way Sutherland sings, but her vibrato is too much here and she is not soft enough. When it comes to Bergonzi; He covers too much, I simply miss ""the ring and ping."" And why does he go for the high c in ...O mio rimorso..., when it sounds like he is a twelve year old boy. It is not that I do not like high c sung in pianissimo, wich is a difficult thing to do, but in that part of Traviata? Why? Merill sings with power and beauty in his main-aria, but it don't change my opinion about this recording. At last, the orchestra plays very nice, but the sound is mixed in a terrible way! and I think it is one of the mainproblem in this production.Go for another traviata..."
5,THE OPERA OF OPERS,This is one of the best works of Verdi and Giuseppe Verdi was the gratest opera composer. Listen to this music and let it sink into your feelings.
1,Beware of Duane Swilley,"Duane Swilley was revealed in recent court depositions to be a child molester. I do not believe that anyone who molests children has anything to say that I want to hear. I don't believe he has anything to teach about success. Google ""duane swilley"" and research him for yourself before you give him any money. Beware of wolves in sheep's clothing!!!"
1,not worth the price,the price of this bike was below $190 and there were a couple of reviews before. but amazon deleted it. this makes me feel so bad about amazon. why delete others reviews?
1,Don't waste your money,"Cheap, cheap cheap. Do not purchase this bike. It is cheaply made. I know a bit about bikes, the gears slip even after I have adjusted them, the entire braking system is terrible. I have adjusted the brakes multiple times but every time the bike is riden they fail again. It is a very heavy bike. I would only recommend this bike as a gift to somone you dislike."
4,Awesome price,I paid 199 here in Amazon having free delivery.I love the bike and is a pretty good deal with a front break disk.If you have any questions you can reach me at jcmuro@hotmail.com
4,One answer to shading your LCD,"I like using my Coolpix 4500 while kayaking. Trying to see the LCD in the sun was futile, especially since I did not have one hand free to shade the LCD. For awhile I just used the viewer, but then I could not take pictures at water level, which is one of the reasons I bought the camera.A hood is the answer. This one comes with a thin frame bracket. You attach it to the perimeter of the camera's LCD. You have to peel away a paper coating that reveals a sticky coating. Just press the frame in place (Nikon provides two brackets).The hood has a tab on the top and bottom. You just snap it into the bracket when you need to use it. I found that it stays tight. The only problem you may have is where to store the hood. Nikon claims you can press it flat. You can, but when you wish to use it again, it is somewhat out of shape. You have to work it a bit before it's rectangular again. I just don't fold mine."
5,So glad that this is now available in CD to keep forever.,"About 8 years ago, a dear friend introduced this to me with a copied cassette recording. After no longer having the cassette, I longed to hear it again. Now, I am able to do so and reminesce and enjoy these special songs, again. Only a Fool and Walk Away are my favorites!"
5,So glad that this is now available in CD to keep forever.,"About 8 years ago, a dear friend introduced this to me with a copied cassette recording. After no longer having the cassette, I longed to hear it again. Now, I am able to do so and reminesce and enjoy these special songs, again. Only a Fool and Walk on are my favorites!"
5,For the price its a great product,"It must be made of really thin stainless steel, it dents easily. However it looks good and makes stepping into the truck very easy for my old parents. The F150 has offroad kit so its a bit high even for regular people. So far no rust but only 3 months old and driven in CO with no salt."
2,One hit wonder?,"I bought this CD on the strength of Levie's video of the song ""Her Morning Elegance"". Very interesting video and excellent song. Unfortunately, that was the only song on the CD worth listening to. The rest was rather drab and monotone. If you like ""Her Morning Elegance"", purchase the MP3, Don't waste your money on the CD."
5,Ballads with Hidden Depth,"Soothing music that will seep into your soul slowly. Circular in essence, but in unexpected rhythms and rhymes. The combination of musical instruments is simple without growing old. The more you listen, in fact, the more you hear. The Opposite Side of the Sea is ideal background music for creative work, or soothing end-of-day moments with a cup of tea by the fire. And the music video for Her Morning Elegance is pure beauty. This award winning album is fresh and magical."
3,"Great Music Video, OK CD","I bought this CD because I loved the Music Video (and song) ""Her Morning Elegance."" The rest of the CD was okay, but that is by far their best song."
4,A well balanced performance,"Well, this is already a Solti performance, but the presence of Fischer-Dieskau adds all the necessary pepper!"
5,More,I really want the older episodes i love everything posted so far just want more. Maybe the mid/early 2000s 2006 2005 ect
2,Surprise! Alive and clicking,"The case looks good and its durable. But, if you use the alarm/appointment reminder or inadvertently turn the palm on while its in your pocket--watch out. The cover presses on the buttons on the bottom. Even in my suit jacket pocket, with very little pressure on the case, it will start paging through the calendar, draining the battery."
5,Will this fit the M505???,If this will fit the M505 I'd snap it up in a minute. I've long missed the flacp cover for the convenience of keeping my Palm as light and slim as possible but still protecting it. Can anyone answer this question?
5,First Hand Experience,"I can offer a unique perspective on Ms. Monoson's work because I had the rare pleasure of studying under her while pursuing my master's at Northwestern University. It was one of the most rewarding class experiences I've ever had, especially for someone who is an avid reader of Plato's works. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!"
1,"Stolid, unshapely, objective Bach","This is the old-fashioned Bach that we thought the early-music movement had swept away. Moroney's rhythmic sense is one governed by the ""unelasticher Takt"" notion promulgated in the 20's and 30's. Since the 1960's, however, early-music specialists have been arguing that such fixity in rhythm and tempo is distinctly anti-historical for Bach. Where has Moroney been during all this heady debate? His rhythmic sense seems born of 1945.There is little sweep or gesture in this recording to recommend it. Likewise, his range of articulations is narrow and inexpressive.In addition, I find the harpsichord he plays singularly uninteresting, it's tone lacking in behavior."
1,"Documentary Bach, for those who like their Bach uninterpreted","This recording will serve those who want the aural equivalent of an Urtext edition very well. The performance is objective in every sense, being uninflected by an evident interpretation. Much better are the Leonhardt, Cates, Brookshire, and Rousset recordings, by a very wide margin. Each of these recordings features a distinctive interpretive approach that one can like or dislike. Moroney's approach will offend no one, but will likely bore many. This recording is representative of the pseudo-authenticity that reached a peak in popularity around 1980, but which has not worn well, have been superceded by a new wave of early music performers, each with his or her own voice. Moroney plays much as an editor edits, seeking absolute ""transparency"" through his unwillingness to inflict his own hand on the ""text."""
2,great this is NOT,"How anyone could be so dense as to consider this recording ""great"" is beyond me. Nilsson is available in a number of live performances with a FAR better conductor and Tristan than here. Solti is too slap-dash. He knew nothing of TRISTAN but, based on his Ring sales, he was given this and other recordings. Yet he had no concept of the opera at all. Nilsson is great but she's the only one. Uhl was a decent enough artist but was never a Tristan even with the help of over-miking. Go for any of the Nilsson - Windgassen or the Nilsson - Vickers sets (by the way, Windgassen was much better than the crooning Vickers as Tristan). If you can find the LIVE Bayreuth performance with Nilsson & Windgassen under Bohm, THAT will raise you blood pressure. The DG set is good but was a patchwork of live & rehearsal perfoamnces. The live one has the occasional blemish but you don't remember them. Bottom line - forget this Solti."
3,Love Nilsson? Get other Tristans.,"Solti's expertise is just typical dramaticism and pompous bombast. It works effectively in his Ring recording, but certainly not in this recording. He doesn't interpret it with soul and passion like Karajan or Bohm does. Take the prelude, which is an orchestral staple in many recordings known as Liebestod. It is the most bland and lifeless Prelude ever even with the Vienna Philharmonic strings. This is my first Tristan recording, and the whole recording was a snoozefest throughout the whole time, even with great cast including legendary soprano Birgit Nilsson.Don't kid yourself buying this recording. Fortunately my next Tristan experience with Furtwangler proved the contrary."
2,Nice cover,"I regret that somehow my name/review has appeared twice on this page. That is indeed unintentional, and I sincerely hope that this duplication will be removed, since the version immediately above this one is the fully revised and finalized one that I would look forward to having others read. My apologies for this inconvenience."
2,Disappointing,"I originally really liked the idea of comparing database design to the ancient ""Art of War"" classic, but the more I read the book, the more annoying and overly cute this tactic became.Amongst all the verbiage there appears to be really useful information, but extracting that information became too much work for me and I gave up on this book. And there were almost no concrete examples or case studies to back anything up.So far the most important book I've read is Sql Tuning by Dan Tow. It takes some work, but it is very, very worth it. Try that one instead."
5,A gem,"The rare book on SQL that goes beyond what we've already figured out by hard knocks. The author has a wonderful mix of theory and practice, and shows how procedural realities affect the relational ideals of data access in a relational database.The chapter on nested data structures is so clear that it makes the topic seem self-evident, so, while simplified, you get a solid picture of what's happening before having to 'attack' an overly-messy real-world project.It truly makes a developer using SQL feel like s/he has the upper hand, the inside track, and the secret touch!"
5,Essential reading for any database professional.,There are few database books that are pure gold from cover to cover. This is one of those books. Timeless database principles applied to real life situations. I simply cannot recommend this book enough. The authors not that it is not geared towards DBA's...yeah right! This is a must read for any database professional.
3,"Covers the Envoys, Not the Great Khan","In effect, this book is a highly annotated list of those Europeans sent by the Popes to deal with the Great Khans over a century, and who wrote about it when they got back. While giving some description of each one's experience, it does not go into depth on any one, and is best to get you grounded before deciding which of these original reports you need to read for further research. For the casual history reader, it will be interesting for you to learn of the hopes the Church pinned on the Mongol empire coming to the aid of Crusaders, and the development of the legend of Prester John, always receding to the East until the end of land was reached, whereupon he was transferred to Africa as the terra incognita. The writing is easy to follow without being simplistic, and covers an unusual subject."
2,eh..its ok,Impressed with dr brandts pores no more and microderabrasion in a jar i decided to try his moisturizer. this moisturizer is not very effective for combo/oily skin like it says. its quite thick and sits heavy on the skin. i never saw an improvement in my pores and i believe it actually clogged them. it is not good as a daily moisturizer...however i do use the product after microdermabrasion because it is hydrating after heavy exfolation.
5,The Best Entry Level HD LCD TV,"I have had this TV for about a month now and I love it.I did a fair amount of research before purchasing (I mean $750 is alot of money to me... can't quite swing the $1,400+ for the sony, etc... -- and even if I could I don't think I care about the incremental picture quality that much). The previous model was liked by most and this one competes very well with the rest of the entry level market. It has a good set of inputs (component, composite, VGA, HDMI ....) [I wish it had two HDMI ports, but 1 works just fine].I use this in my office for TV and computer montior and it works great! One very nice feature is the PIP, where I can work on the computer and watch/listen to TV in the PIP (sizable, moveable, split screen as well).If you are looking for a great entry level LCD HDTV, I highly recommend this one. IT IS HD ready (built in tuner), not just HD capable."
1,"They're right, DO NOT BUY","I bought this unit just before X-mas for my son's room.A few days after hooking it up we too experienced the volume at full blast when turning it on.And it's not just the volume of a tuned in station.Rather it sounds like static like when you tune to a station with no signal.This seems to be isolated to the TV input only as I've not seen this when powering up with the HDMI input selected.I contacted viewsonic's support, to be confronted with someone that was rude, unprofessional, and argumentative.This set is going back.I know you may be tempted by the price but trust me, the couple hundred you may save upfront is going to cost you dearly.Don't do it."
4,it performs like I thought it would,I have mounted on my wall and use as my pc moniter. so far so good
5,Step by Step...Yup!,"My wife found this Step by Step to be the most helpful book she has ever used. She is new to Publisher, and this book carried her through without a glitch. I on the other hand, an experienced user of Publisher, will be checking out ""By Design""Good job on the book! I will recommend to all new users of Publisher!"
3,Some fun but not very functional,"This is a soft hood that screws into the lens housing. It does what a hood is supposed to do...block stray light and give some protection to the lens. Being a soft hood, it can also provide cushioning if the camera is dropped. However, the hood does not come with a cap, and there is no way to put the original lens cap on without taking the hood off. The hood also blocks the lower half of the flash. So,the hood is an interesting play thing, but not really convenient."
4,"Good design, I like it","This is a large hood and I doubt there'll be any lens glare at wide to medium zoom positions with this thing on! At full zoom though, at least on my Nikon Coolpix 5700, there's not much hood shielding the sides of the lens from glare because the lens is so far out. I haven't had any trouble with this, it's just an observation I made.This hood is all rubber except the ring containing the mounting threads, they're metal, so if you knock it against something likely it won't get damaged, (the hood OR what ever it knocks against) due to the soft rubber; 'good idea Nikon'. The interior of the hood has ringes molded into it, to reduce reflections, I'm sure. The only downside is the thing looks like a toilet plunger because of its shape and size and you would not want to have it on if you were trying to be inconspicuous."
4,Bond of Hatred,"A great read. Start with Cinderella, hiding her light under a bushel. Add a rich, powerful, and vengeful billionaire and lots of tension. Enjoy watching the tables turn on Mr. Well Spoilt midstream. Lots of smirks and quirks, great passion, and good fun."
2,Doesn't seem that good....,"I'm a big fan of LG, but honestly, I have to say that I just didn't find anything special in this particular book....The story of the ultra-rich paternal uncle & dirt-poor maternal aunt of an illegitimate baby starting to fall for each other from the beginning & ostensibly marrying just for the sake of the baby has been done to death by at least a few different & very popular romance novelists in pretty much the same fashion over the yrs., & this one just didn't present any exception what-so-ever....Also, the hero of this book actually comes across as a very juvenile kind of man in a way, & I don't think this makes much sense at all what-so-ever even if this is just a work of fiction...."
3,Not her best,The characters are shallow.Predictable plot. She has written better. I am usually a fan of her books. Will continue to read them.
4,Hungary's 1956 Revolution,"This is really a good video. It covers the basics of the 1956 revolution in Hungary from the point of view of the Olympic Polo Team. This team beat the Russian team while the revolution was still occuring in Hungary. If you're interested in learning a bit about what happened in Hungary, this is worth watching!"
5,Dessert cook book,"This was a replacement for my old copy. I was very please with the condition of the replacement book, and I use it often."
5,Divine!,This CD is one of the most exquisite i have heard. Hauntingly beautiful and mesmerizing mantrasongs...-Dana Hofford
5,Dulce,"Sweet Buenos Aires. Entre Rios (Between Rivers) changed his musical formula and it works perfectly. Synths, delicated sounds and the most incredible female voice of Argentina make one of the best pop albums of the year. Dear 'indiepopers' friends, if you like Postal Service, Lali Puna, and things like than..well, this is better."
1,I am going to drop this class becuase of the book,"I have never used a book so lackluster in its ability to convey information. Keep in mind this is suppose to be a college level thermodynamics book. Please heed this advice and save your money and time. If for some reason your school uses this book, I advise that you buy another text if you want to actually learn. This is a first edition, but I cannot see this book go far with students without a complete re-vamp."
1,This is what evil must look like!,"All the horrible things written in the other reviews are true. There are tons of typos. The derivation of the formulas is short. Worst of all, the explanation of the concepts is extremely confusing. I gave up using the book after i finished chapter 6 (entropy).I just found out of the library of my university had ""Fundamentals of engineering thermodynamics"" by Michael Moran. The rating of it is pretty good on Amazon. I am gonna go borrow the book tomorrow and check it out. I hope this book is much better."
1,Because I can't give it zero stars ...,"This book is flat out horrible. It was written by UT professors so all UT thermo classes are required to use it. If you go to UT, well, I'm sorry. The examples are useless, the book is filled with typos (which, in equations, are not trivial), and concepts are poorly explained or, better yet, not explained at all. If I had written this book (I wouldn't have written this book) I would be ashamed to put my name on it. If your class requires you to buy this text, like mine did (because it's the only source of tables we're allowed to use on exams), you have my sympathies. If you don't already know thermodynamics I would recommend using this book just for the tables and buying another book to actually teach you the subject matter."
1,Lousy - buy a PowerMac,"Combine a decent G4 with a low end 17"" monitor and 128MB of very slow SDRAM and you get a computer that should stay on the shelf. Don't buy anything but a PowerMac with 512M of DDR-SDRAM. If you want to run any high end software then make it a dual G4. I wouldn't curse an eMac on my worst enemy. Think before you buy."
5,Perfect First Computer,"My girlfriend purchased an eMac as her first computer and has had a great time learning on it. For the past 5 months it has been rock solid. It has a beautiful screen, much like the 17"" monitor that goes with my G4 Cube. We have had no monitor problems like some have reported. DVD playback(if you have it) is very clear and you can rip a CD in about 5 minutes. Spring for the stand, a subwoofer, and more memory if you can. 100% Satisfied."
1,Had trouble from the start,"Let me start by saying I own a Macbook Pro and LOVE it. I liked the Mac setup so much I bought my daughter an eMac. She had trouble with it so we brought it to CompUSA (where we bought it) to have it repaired. A week after we got it home it was broken again. This computer is heavy and hard to carry because there is nothing to hold onto. Since we bought Applecare we brought it to an Apple store to have it repaired again. They were great. Turned out that it would cost too much to repair and gave us a new iMac to replace it. We were very happy with their service, but the eMac just didn't work for us."
5,This computer is great,I have had my unit for several months now with zero problems. I easily upgraded my memoty to 1gb and that was well worth it. I run photoshop and illustrator as well as indesign for school and have no problems with the machine operating this software. I also purchased a kodak digital camera which works great with i-photo. This was a very positive purchase as well as being my first mac and I will definatly purchase a mac again.
4,A Layperson and Parent's Review,"I am a parent who shares custody with a long and difficult history. This book has been instrumental in providing me with deep insights into how my reactions and behaviors are affecting my child, and what I can do to help. Its is not a self-help book, but the information in it is instructive to help, particularly for the child being parented. I am quite appreciative of the information and how it was presented. It also gave me valuable perspective into the child custody evaluation process and the particular evaluator engaged for our matter. Its nothing a parent either needs or wants experinece with personally. I wish I had read it or been referred to it before/while participating in our evaluaiton a few years ago - My kid would have benefitted most."
2,crisis for kids or parents?,"This is a fine book if there is a good deal of conflict in a divorce; however, there is little attention given to context and a huge attention given to kids. Kids these days are socially constructed to live with entitlement and have become weak in dealing with reality. The book advises more of the same. Parents in real conflict need a psych evaluation done on both homes and both parents, or let the court honor 50:50 parental time. The book can be helpful, if you can read through the generalizations and canned prescriptions."
4,GOOD AMP,I GOT THIS AMP A WEEK AGO AND I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE POWER IT HAD FOR SUCH A SMALL AMP. EVEN THOUGH ITS A LITTLE OVERRRATED ITS NOT PUTTING OUT A TRUE 800W RMS IT DOES JUST FINE FOR MY KENWOOD 12'S. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEMD THIS AMP TO ANYONE. GREAT PRODUCT AND FAST SHIPPING FROM AMAZON.
2,Not Worth It,It is difficult to learn anything from this software. There are just a bunch of lists to memorize and no real in depth explanation of the languages. There is no breakdown of the language alphabet which is how everyone starts learning a language in the first place. I would not recommend you buy this item unless you love wasting money.
3,If you want a collection of quotes . . . this one's for you.,"I think the artist reveals more about himself through his music than this book reveals about him. The book is basically a collection of quotes made by the artist which have been printed over the years. There is not much information on the lawsuit with Sony either. Most of the material is dated. I would find a book written by the artist himself more interesting than a reproduction of tabloids. Maybe the title should read ""In Their Own Words"" since the quotes are derivative from the media."
3,Basic Media Quotes,this Book puts different things He has said over the years kinda all Scattered out.it's cool reading Respect that He has gotten from different Artists&Groups in the Business.His Battle was Legendary with Sony.it Inspired Prince for better or Worse.but that isn't mentioned here.He deserves a full book that highlights His Talent&Career in full detail.interesting overview here though on His Artistic Challenges&Influences.
3,It's ok,"I like this player, but I can't listen to my e-books on it. For some reason it won't recognize my e-books as i-river files on this device. I was very disappointed. I think next time I'll just get and i-pod."
1,Great---If it Works,"I loved this player's size and features, but then it stopped working. Just dead. Won't turn on. E-mailed iRiver support---no reply after two weeks. As I write this review, I've been on hold with iRiver customer service for 22 minutes and have yet to speak to a human. First and last iRiver product I'll ever buy."
5,AWESOME little player,"I have done extensive research and have read many reviews about different mp3 players out there, and finally had settle on this one. I purchased it here on amazon and just got it a couple of days ago. Overall, the built quality is very impressive. Although it's small in size, but feel very sturdy, and of course, the sound, flawless, and powerful. The included headphone is not bad at all, actually it's quite good. I purchased a creative MuVo 256MB for my sister a couple of months ago, and the sound on this one is definitely better than the MuVo one. I guess if there's one complaint about it, that would be the included armband, too small. I read that in a review somewhere, but told myself that it'd probably fit me right since I'm not Arnold or even close, but nope, I was wrong. So I'm back on Amazon now to buy me another armband for this player. But overall. I highly recommend this player to anyone who's looking for a flash-based mp3 player."
2,Does not measure up to hype,"I skipped the ipod because I wanted a fm radio. The 795 offered a radio and the in-line recording capability. To this point, I am disappointed. The stick control is very sensitive making it difficult to use. Moreover, the radio gets poor reception. On the positive side, the sound quality is good, and it does get good battery life. I would also say that if you have medium sized arms the arm band is useless (and hideous). Because the radio is useless, I would have been better off with the ipod."
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,"I purchased the iriver IFP-795T several months ago. When I installed the software, it causes my keyboard to be disabled... there's some type of a driver incompatibility problem. The only resolution was to reinstall the original driver set. This is a repeatable compatibility problem.I've tried contacting iRriver multiple times for resolution to get it to work with my PC. They are totally unresponsive.In the meantime, I have a choice... use my MP3 player or use my keyboard. Some choice!I can accept that there's an incompatibilty problem. What I can't accept is that iRiver won't help me fix it. They won't even respond to my messages.This product is junk. Don't buy it if you have any doubts about compatibility with your equipment."
2,Unconvincing Fundamentalism,"Geisler is a fundamentalist theologian who has written numerous apologetical and theological works. I will admit I'm strongly prejudiced against fundamentalism, but this theologian even actively takes creation science (the belief the Earth and universe are 10,000 years old) seriously and tries to dismiss any science which disagrees with this theological view.He is familiar with Christian theological tradition, but on the whole, his works which try to prove fundamentalist dogmas are entirely unconvincing."
2,Frustrating and underpowered,"I already had a collection of wireless adapters, but seeing this product and its reviews made me think I could do better so I gave it a shot (Click above to see my reviews on some of my adapters).My first complaint is that it would not run on my laptop at all. I have XP SP2 and the setting the manual tells you to uncheck to enable the adapter is not present for some reason. The customer support section of the web site is just a copy of the manual I already had problems with.So I tried my desktop running XP that had never been on the internet and had no updates. Instalation was no problem and it was up in minutes.I tried connecting to various routers and even though percentage wise I seemed to have a good connection it took minutes to load google and longer for any other site.It felt like I was using a 14.4 modem to surf the web no matter which router I used.Appearance wise, if it matters, it's huge and clunky for a wireless adapter and hardly portable."
5,as good as it gets,"I have read just about every book out there on self defense and this book by Sonny Franco is right up there with the best of them. Like all good self defense books, this one puts a big emphasis on awareness and de-escalation skills.But where i think this book stands out is when it gets down to the nitty gritty- the physical confrontation with the attacker. Mr. Franco teaches survival- plain and simple. The techniques described are meant to maim and kill. Nothing pretty, just whatever is neccessary. I thought this book was very empowering. If one fully integrated the information from this book into their psyche, that person would about as ready for trouble as you can get."
5,A Keeper from the first word.,"I read continuously so I find it impossible to keep all the books I ""like."" But from the first chapter Medeiros captures your attention and your heart. I feel in love with Prudence and Sebastain. I have since read all her books to date, but this one holds a special place on my bookshelf."
3,Why is it always betrayal?,"I liked this book. The author makes the characters come alive with her discriptions and dialouge. It's a very good book, the story is interesting and well plotted. However, it seems that in all of Medeiros books, someone thinks that the someone else betrayed them! This works for a while, but after that it gets to be very repetitive! I loved the characters, Jamie made me laugh out loud! If you buy this book I don't think you will be disappointed."
2,Heather and Velvet,This book was boring and I had to skip pages just to finsh it I have read some of her other books and they were much better so if you want to read Teresa Medeiros Then I hope you don't start with this one.
1,Ugh!,"I was truly disappointed! I have always found the online reviews very useful in selecting romance novels---in this case I question whether or not we read the same book! I thought that the story moved at a snail's pace! Too much dull conversation! The storyline seemed to wander in many directions. I bought this one because I enjoyed her ""Charming the Prince."" I'll be alot more careful in chosing her as one of my online purchases. Save your pennies for one of the many other great romance books that you can buy!"
3,"Great love lines/scenes, too much misunderstanding!","Enjoyed Charming the Prince a lot... This story had a lot of potential, too. The story move through so many different locations/scenes at times it was hard to follow and seemed fragmented. Sabastian had some of the most erotic/exciting lines in this book. The hero and heroine were a little hard for me to get to love since he was such a horrible criminal most of the book and she was so up tight about so many things. I hate the parts that Sabastian insists on marrying Prudence's aunt even though they know they belong with each other (sort of). The love tension between the two were well depicted, but I agreed with the last reviewer that there were too many lies. Each of them were trying to do what they thought were best for the other by lying, druging, or something else. Can we have a little honesty? Anyway, some of the love scenes were incredible and I could feel the torment between the two. I would still read her books."
1,WARNING: THIS CD IS COPY CONTROLLED,"I'd like to review this album, but unfortunately I can't even listen to it as it won't play on my Mac--which, along with the iPod, is how I listen to music--because it's COPY CONTROLLED. (This fact was not mentioned anywhere on the product's Amazon.com webpage when I ordered it or at the time I'm writing this.) While Kasey Chambers is totally a five star act, I can't give this album more than one star because any copy protection that penalizes legitimate buyers is absolutely ridiculous.Even if you don't own a Mac, you may want to pass on COPY CONTROLLED CDs as they supposedly won't work on other types of players as well, such as Microsoft's Xbox videogame console."
1,stopped workin within 20 days,don't buy this watch. it stopped working with first 20 days :( ..along with that...its too bulky...
3,Biiiiiig Watch,"This is a nice looking chronograph, but the photograph does not do justice to how huge this watch is. It fit me after taking 5 links out of the band, and the watch face pretty much fills my wrist. There is also no fine adjustment on the watch band, so if your ideal watch band length is midway between links, tough luck."
4,4 1 1,"6 track cd single. Kiss the Ground (3 versions), (If I Was) God Tonight (2 versions), and Walls.UPC 715187684522"
4,a story of friendship,Iris and Walter are best friends. Walter's cousin Howie is coming for a visit. Walter is excited to introduce Iris to Howie. Howie is he favorite cousin. When Howie comes things start to change. The boys start to leave Iris out of their activities. Iris's family helps her to work out her feelings. In the end things turn out just right!The book is a good story for early readers. The chapters are short and easy to read. It would make a great selection for 1st and 2nd graders.I would recommed this book to other. This is part of a series of books based on the characters Iris and Walter. It's a good way to get kids to enjoy reading.
2,"Amazing Product, bad delivery",I purchased this the Elemis 6.8 oz gel because I believe its the best shaving product I have ever tried. Unfortunately I received a smaller size and when I complained the company said that the sent the smaller one because they ran out of the big one. It was totally unacceptable.
2,Elemis Ice-Cool Foaming Shave Gel,"The gel works well and the cooling effect numbs your skin so shaving is less irritating. However, the compressed can has gone bad on me and the Elemis company will not replace an almost full can, nor will they of course refund my money.So beware! Maybe the non compressed tube would be your best option. I won't do business with the Elemis company so I don't know."
4,Couldn't put it down.....,"If you like humanoid sci-fi you'll like this book. On a planet not unlike our own, the reader is drawn into that age old struggle of how to preserve ones own culture when faced with an overwhelming tide of ""others"". And although set on a distant world, the dilemmas faced by its inhabitants hath a familiar ring.Truly a throwback to vintage science fiction. John W. Campbell, Jr. would have approved."
1,Racist Scumbag!,"John Bramhall is a hatemonger of the lowest sort and ""Deep Blue - A Novel of Racial Conflict"" is the worst kind of racist propaganda. I have not read this book by the way, I found out about this book beacause the author is spamming random sites with bigoted slurs, trolling for some haters who will buy his prejudiced crap. Don't do it!"
5,great,I can promise you that you have never seen a movie like this twisted but very good. Watch this one you won't regret it.
3,"Misleading Title, Praises to Maharishi","Its takes a while to get past the front of the book which offers praises of Maharishi, his history and plans to transform the world. Once you get past that (which appears again in the rear of the book) you realize this book does not teach you TM (so why is it in the title?).There are some helpful things in this book especially if you are new to the spiritual path. But if you are looking for a serious book on meditation in general look elsewhere. This is more on the 'so how are you doing now after learning TM' side."
5,amazing book,this book is profound and timeless. a boon to anyone's life. a book that can and should be read o ver and over again throughout life.
2,The great cost of enlightenment,"This book I found to be a difficult read. It says that this form of meditation needs to be taught to you, and it can eventually bring about world peace. Well, it neglects to say that it costs about $2,500 to do so. It also says that you cannot become enlightened unless you do nothing like business or run a household, so it is not for most people. How does the maharishi fit in here, being a man of business, if I am not mistaken?This is confusing. You already need a lot of excess cash to learn TM; where does this money go? If they think TM is the cure to the world's ills, then why not make it more accessible, ie. make it affordable to the masses? I would think David Lynch has the right idea; his foundation is making it available to school children. Perhaps these children will one day decide that no one owns TM and it should be taught to anyone wo wants it for free."
1,Don't be a fool,"I have two ferrets and have owned many over the last 20 years as beloved pets. You want to give them a treat, have them lick some peanut butter off your finger or give them a real piece of chicken or make them an omelet. Jerky treats are all over the news with recalls because some of them are coming out of China and packaged by companies you thought you can trust. Purina has two jerky treats recalled 1/9/13 after they knowingly were hurting and killing dogs for years. People were mailing and calling.Furthermore, don't feed ferrets Purina Kitten Chow. Feed them high quality foods such as Totally Ferret, Evo Ferret or Evo Cat and Kitten formula."
2,Not worth the money or the wait,"I picked up this cd do to hearing ""rain down on me"" (later to find it was a remix) on a soundtrack. I was looking forward to hearing an innovative electronic rock band like many others spawning from the Netherlands and the rest of Europe. I was most disapointed when I heard this countryish 'Train' style band which is all over the place in the U.S. today. Though they are much better then most at what they do, it did not overshadow my high expectations which were not met. A few decent songs but nothing to match the awe I felt when I heard Rain Down on Me."
3,Too sweet.,"I bought this for my son its supposed to be really good, was recommended to us by the dental hygienist. I thought it was too sweet but he loved it. I'm not sure the price is right for this, you could try a Jason natural one for less."
5,Great for Ruger 10/22!,"Yes the rail does hang over the receiver a bit if you mount it so 4 screws are used. But, like someone else stated already, if you flip it around you can utilize 3 screw holes and it is centered much better on the receiver.I mounted a small cqb red dot on this and couldn't be happier."
3,"Good, but with challenges","The See Through Weaver mount fits perfect (choice of 6 pre-drilled holes) and I can just get the iron sights diamond and dot. The challenge to the unit is the cheap, recess screws. Three fit fine and one stripped, although the 'free' weaver mount (with the 10/22) screws fit with just a little loss of view. Scope fits and easy transition back to iron sights. The mount has a 1/8 inch lip over the receiver. Good buy."
3,See thru mount,"Mount is good quality, but the screws included did not fit the predrilled holes for mounting. The scope I purchased came with a mount (did not know it was a see-thru mount, ad didn't show one) and then a rail to mount the scope. I am not using this mount."
4,Good product,Good quality product. Installs just right. Easy to install accessories on the rails. Great view down the slot to the front sight. I'm happy with this mount.
4,Red Hawk puts his intense life experiences in his work.,I have known Red Hawk all of my life & he is one of the most intense questioners of the meaning of life & death on this planet. Some of his narratives relate to his own life directly & some indirectly. He wondrous storyteller.
4,Excellent player. Wish sound quality were better with AS,"This is a great CD player. Easy to use, doesn't eat batteries and sounds as good as any portable I have ever listened to-IF you keep both the XBS and the anti-shock off. I would be a lot happier if they had improved the bit rate through the shock buffer, but that would have meant shortening its length or upping the price, so presumably their marketing department wouldn't let them. The player still has reasonable shock resistance without the shock buffer, adequate for walking smoothly."
5,Simple and Functional,"I'd just like to say that my unit just gave in after four great years of use. The SL-S360 is so simple that you can just take it out of the box and KNOW it, without having to read the instructions. The sound quality was near perfect, and the Anti-shock system was amazing. You can drop this thing on the floor and it'll just keep going. If you're looking for a CD player that's reliable without all the unecessary bells and whistles, make this the one."
1,Used CD player,Knew it was used but it was advertised as non-skip. It skips badly. Had to buy a new one.
5,5 Stars to Panasonic's Product and Amazon's Price!,"After my last CD player ceased to provide me with exceptional playback, for the records... it was a sony discman, I began to look for a new one. Expecting to pay as much as two-hundred dollars, I almost collapsed when I saw that Amazon only wanted $79.99 for this one. Let me tell you that this CD player is worth every penny I paid and a hundred more! When in antiskip mode I found no way to make it skip! The sound is absolutely terrific. The headphones, after a little getting used to, are more comfortable than sonys. Also, Amazon doesn't mention it but this player has what is called a pop-up eject system. All you do is push a button and the CD pops up, no more prying! Please notice that the CD player is really silver and gray, not white and gray like I thought. Still, a terrific looking, working, and priced CD player."
2,Excellent CD Player but not suited for jogging,"I bought this model packaged in the ""Jogger"" configuration with a waste-belt carrier. It is advertised as being able to play without skipping during mild jogging/running. WRONG! While perfectly suited for walking and bicycling, you'll only get 41 seconds into your run before being plagued with skipping problems. Overall: A good unit, but not good enough to take jogging... unless you want to carry it in your hand."
4,Okay,This book will teach you the perfect lesson of life; it doesn't come easy. And since Cal tells you about it it's even a better lesson.
2,"Ok, But a bit Weird",This book was ok. The story was well written and I really liked the intense descriptions. This was a little scary for me but since I started it I finished it (in the light of day). If you're not into the after life with your romance this is not the book for you.
3,Not bad,"this book was different. Not bad different but interesting different. There was a plot twist that I would not have expected...its not something that generally graces the pages of a romance book even if it is romantic suspense. I didn't expect to like it since she was so much older and he so much younger but it worked. It was clear that Sean loved Lacey and Lacey couldn't fight her attraction for him. The only thing that would have been icing on the cake is if Lacey had gone through something more than her son dying since Sean went though and throughout the book he was steadfast in his feelings for her.This type of book wasn't really my cup of tea but it was good. If you like IR, a hint of the supernatural, and a suspense story with secrets (and not predictable secrets at that) needing to be told then this is the book for you."
4,A Solid Foundation,"I found this book to give a good foundation for role-playing in the golden age of piracy. I found it a good mixture of fact and cinematic fiction. The classes and prestige classes seemed balanced to me and all of them seemed to have a place in a pirate campaign. I especially enjoyed the section on the loa and djab. None of the sections were exhaustive in their information on the setting, but then the book is really only meant to be an overview. In my experience, a ""high adventure"", cinematic style of role playing only gets bogged down with too much background, so I found the setting information in Skull & Bones to be adequate for my needs as a GM. All in all, I am very happy to have this addition to my RPG library, and it will get extensive use in my current campaign."
5,Great!!,Great price/great product! I keep it in the freezer and it works PERFECTLY for my pie crusts. They wouldn't turn out the same without it!!
2,Waste of money!!!,"Is a useless product, the cloth is too thick and smelly.The frabric is too rough, is not a good pastry cloth."
1,Wrong type of pacifier,Ok maybe it was my mistake don't know. But these are not the extremely hard to find round binkys these are the flat tip nuk style binkys. I have been desperately searching all over for the round binkys and thought I finally nailed it but nope my baby hates these and just spits them out . I hope this review helps all those searching for the round classic style binkys .
2,The wrong one,"Of course it wasn't the sellers fault. It was mine by not seeing the pacifiers clearly by description. I thought it was ""most liked mothers pacifiers"" which wasn't so I returned the item."
5,My Most Used Cookbook,"Of my massive collection of cookbooks, this is the one I reachfor the most often when I want to make an old-favorite (e.g. Chili for a Crowd, Pasta Puttanesca, Chicken Marbella, or even a pie crust) or if I'm looking for a new dish. The comments and suggestions in the inner sidebars are always insightful and useful. I love this cookbook, and can't believe I've waited so long to get the New Basics to go along with it..."
4,carrot cake,i enjoy this recipe but i have never baked this cake for the 30-35 minutes the recipe calls for. This cake generally takes close to an hour. The end results are always delicious. Could this be a typo or do you like carrot soup?
4,Excellent and delicious reading!,"This book has pride of place in our kitchen. Excellent and unusual recipes and some very interesting variations on old themes. Conversion tables can be a bit hit and miss. If you have kids try the giant chocolate chip cookies, I guarantee the best you have ever tasted!Superlative salads and spectacular patesRead, Cook, eat and enjoy!"
5,An Old Friend,Having the anniversary edition of the Silver Palate Cookbook is like reuniting with an old friend. I can remember giving a copy of the original to a neighbor who was leaving the state. At that time I wrote my own comments next to all my favorite recipes in the book and the recipient loved it. I just did the same thing as I sent a copy to my daughter-in-law for Mothers Day.I have lots of cook books but I have relied most heavily on this one over the years. And it's nice to have it in color now. Joanne Smith
3,Don't Bother Duplicating,"If you have the original, I would not buy this one. There is hardly anything new in it and not too many photos."
5,My favorite cookbook for 25 years!,"I first discovered this fantastic cookbook while at a friend's house. I flipped it open and read a recipe that made my mouth water. I borrowed the cookbook from her and went home and made the dish, which still remains THE favorite family recipe. (It contains Brie cheese, tomatoes, and lots of garlic!) I have never made a recipe I didn't like from this book, and recently re-purchased it for my now grown daughter, who wanted her own copy. I always recommend this cookbook when the topic of cooking comes up. It is a book that has totally stood the test of time. Buy yourself a copy!!!"
3,Bit Disappointing,This book got such good reviews and yet I have yet to make one thing out of it. I browsed it once it arrived and it just didn't have anything special about it.
1,Missing Recipes (?),"Just replaced my torn, tattered, splattered paperback copy of SP with the 25th edition in hardback. Looked for my favorite potato-cheese soup recipe . . . and it's not there! Are other old favorites missing, too? I'm going to have to go through both books and cross-check for missing treasures. Rats! Anyone else know what all is missing from the 25th ed.?"
4,Delectable Recepies That Are Quintessential To All Cooks!,This is a wonderful cook book - I love the side notes and suggestions....The Pumpkin Pie Recipe is like no other I've tried and now is an essential element of my Thanksgiving Dessert offerings! Not too sweet and just the perfect amount of spices (Cardamom too) makes it extra aromatic and a delightful end to a savory meal.
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by this cookbook. I know many people who swear by it, but I have found the recipes uninspiring. Many of the recipes sound interesting, but when I've tried them they have mostly turned out unappealing and flavorless. There are better books out there."
1,Disappointing,"Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media. The graphics of the book are truly beautiful. The recipes however, hmmm, try again. I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result. I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great. Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness. Graphics? Great. Photography? Great? Recipes? You have got to be kidding"
1,silver palate cook book,this is without a doubt the worst cook book i have ever seen. i would not even use it as a gift to a person i don't like. gayle grant gayle's white velvet cheesecake
3,Where is the book?,I have not yet received this book and am wondering where it is. I have not heard anything from the seller.
1,Pretentious and amateurish,"Simply awful. An atrocious film.Jacques Brel is a relatively recent discovery of mine. After listening to the new off-Broadway CD, I sought out the old CD and DVD. Well, the movie version is a morass of amateurish, ham-handed attempts at symbolism and avante garde film making. The ""acting"" is like something out of a sub-par community theater production.I can't imagine ever watching this painful film again."
4,Good product,"The only problem was that the plastic case the the sunglasses are shipped in was broken in transit. However, the sunglasses were undamaged."
4,Works well,Fumbled a few minutes to attach these to my glasses. Once on they work well and do the job as advertised.
3,"Good quality, but could be wider","These work as advertised and are light, and stay on the glasses. My only wish would be that they would be a bit wider to cover the entire lens of my glasses. They stay put, don't scratch the glasses' lenses and perform just like more expensive, custom, polarized clip-ons."
1,not sized as listed,"these sunglasses are listed for the dimensions of the lenses. However, because of where the metal mounting brackets go, the lenses are not able to cover to listed measurements. Be careful. In fact, I'd simply order something else. These being mis advertized do not deserve your business."
5,An improvement over trying to wear shades over your glasses.,"I can't stand trying to wear a pair of sunglasses over the top of my glasses, am too blind without my glasses to wear sunglasses alone, and am too cheap to buy a prescription pair. These are perfect for the rectangular style of glasses that came into fashion a couple years ago. The measurements they give are accurate and these fit nicely. They do make the glasses a little more front heavy but after a few minutes I forget I'm wearing them."
3,packaging not as nice as Ring Box set,"The music is great (refer to the other reviews). Just wanted to note that the packaging wasn't as nice as with the earlier released Der Ring des Nibelungen / Solti box set. I was disappointed that for this box set, the CDs were not packaged in paper sleeves inside a nice folding box. Instead, each opera is stored in one of those bulky 4CD plastic containers. Not as classy. ..."
3,Keychain,"It is a cute novelty product, more for decoration then use. Rather large to be hung from actual key chain or purse."
2,Couldn't get into it,"This book and I are not a match made in the heavens. I'm a slow reader, and the story is a slow mover, and the two together make for a tedious read.For me the book was overly intellectual, there was not enough action or emotion. The story is so dry at times it's almost textbook like. Attention to detail is taken to the extreme, and often does nothing to further the plot lines or character development.I only read the first 120 pages, and I couldn't take it anymore and gave up. Several metaphysical concepts where introduced, such as lucid dreaming, and visions, and channeling, but I did not find the insights from these activities particularly enlightening in the book.The book is almost 500 pages, so maybe it gets better as it goes along. Unfortunatly I'm just not interested enough to find out.Entertainment: 2 starsEnlightenment: 2 stars"
5,Love this movie.,John Wayne movies have always been some of my favorites and this one is my favorite of all of them. I had a little trouble with the picture quality on my kindle and it kept trying to download several times but the fourth time I tried to watch it it worked very well.
5,Delightful and sensitive performance,Great singing by the marvelous counter- tenor Ragin and soprano McNairSensitive conducting
1,Went rancid fast,"I bought a bottle of Home Health Castor oil from my local health foods store about a month ago and it doesn't expire for another TWO YEARS and I was very disappointed to find a large mold cloud forming in the bottom of the bottle (which is a clear bottle so it's very easy to see). I thought because it was cold pressed and the only ingredient is ""Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil"" that it could be stored at room temperature (I haven't read anywhere that it needed to be store in the fridge, no where on the product label either). I've always kept Olive oil and jojoba oil out of the fridge and they do fine. I guess I would recommend to others to try keeping it in the fridge. I and VERY DISAPPOINTED, MONEY WASTED."
5,Seems to work - for running off the moles destroying my yard,"A mix of castor oil, dish detergent and water sprayed over my entire yard seems to have worked in convincing the moles to move to a different location for better tasting meals. Castor oil from the local pharmacy was relatively expensive so I'm happy to have found this solution. (Plus, the clerk gave me a strange look when I bought 4 of their little bottles!) It's been about 6 weeks since I sprayed the yard and I need to do it again."
5,Love It!,"It works great to seal moisture into my hair, and also softens and protects my edges. It's very thick, so only a little is needed. If I have dry patches on my scalp,"
4,"entertaining, but no pictures","Maybe it's just me, but when someone is teaching me how to dance, I like a picture (or, better yet, video) of how each move goes. It takes more practice when you're reading about it. Other than that, this is a great book. I learned some new things and can't wait to try them out on a live person!"
1,Not at all what I expected!,"I thought the book may be helpful with ideas, moves, songs, etc; which to an extent it is however, it suggests quite DATED songs, how to put costumes togther using baling wire and a paperclip, bush your boobs in your mans face no matter the size. It really is for beginners."
1,The Essenes,"I'm still waiting for this book to arrive. I cannot read the book about the Magdalene, which is the follow up to this book. until I receive this book..the first book. Where is it?"
2,Not what I expected,This book is entirely based on past life regression - so don't buy it unless you believe in that. There's no references to historical or archaeological information.
3,Fustrating!,"Past live regressions of two persons who claim to be Joseph of Arimathea and Daniel, both close associates of Jesus and part of a so-called Core Group of Essenes who were close to The Master. Daniel claims that Jesus survivied the cruxifiction, escaped through a secret tunnel in the tomb provided by Joseph, then travelled secretly north to Damascus.Then the story ends there! WTF? The book never answers the tantilizing question: WHERE DID JESUS GO?!?Granted, these transmission were pre-Da Vinci Code, but it certainly was post Holy Blood Holy Grail. Why didn't it occur to the regressionists to find out what happened next? Where they saving it for a sequel?This is what drives me nuts about these books--so many unanswered questions that the reader fustrated beyond belief."
2,Better books out there.,"If I had read this years ago I may have found it a bit informative, but it rambles without any real details. If you want to read a better history of the Essenes read Anna, Grandmother of Jesus by Claire Heartsong."
4,A good companion book.,"Some of the stuff in here is repeated in other books, but there is also additional info, that onlyhelps to clarify, that there was more to the story, than most religions are really telling us.Compares to Cayces, Life of Jesus."
3,Masco Bath Heavy duty,"I expected It would be nicer than those I 've seen in Home depot or Orchard Supply ( Heavy duty ). Yet, it 's the same. I had to wait such a long time to receive so the project was delayed."
2,"A great recording, but..","Listening to this recording i had the impression that Idomeneo is really a masterpiece. But i had some deceptions: Anthony Rolfh Johnson is borring and the charismatic Ian Bostridge sings beautifully but does'nt have the streght for the role. The orchestra plays very well and the recording is captured in excellent sound. Lorraine Hunt is excellent and Barbara Fritolli, moving, despite an excessive vibrato. This is a good recordng, but this opera demands much more."
5,Inspiring Hope~,"Chuck Pierce's life and family expieriences are incredible to read about. The spiritual and life lessons poured into this book help provide a much needed roadmap for obtaining and keeping what God originally designed for our lives. So grateful all this information and revelation is in one place.Thank you,Grateful in Nashville"
4,Excellent!!,"I have read other books by Chuck Pierce but this is a favorite. It absolutely brims over with information on God's plan for our inheritance, how to claim it, barriers etc. I found the section on breaking generational curses very comprehensive. This bokk should be read and reread and shared."
5,My Weimeraners love this,I sprinkle it on top of their food and they lap it up like it's a treat. Keeps their breath fresh and helps keep them from wanting to eat grass
3,Photos Are Better than the Text,"I agree with the comments of a reviewer of the author's companion book, ""Roaring '20s Fashions: Jazz."" Buy this book for the photos, which are excellent. Unfortunately, the text has been poorly edited, with an overabundance of exclamation marks and capital letters rendering the content and captions somewhat amateurish and even silly at times. The use of period photos and fashion illustrations, in addition to the great photos of the vintage clothing, make this book a worthy purchase."
3,Class assigned,I was assigned to read this book for a class. I'm giving it 3 stars because I didn't really like the style but overall it was a pretty good read.
4,Expires Soon!,"If you aren't going to eat those Pop Tarts up within a few months, you might as well not buy them. They expire in December. Thank goodness my boys and family devour Pop Tarts, so I don't have to worry about it! :) This is why they are so cheap. They are about to expire..."
5,Troll alert! Ignore the 1 star rating...,"It should first be stated for all those reading this that the 1-star review you see here is actually a poor attempt at someone trying to make a parody out of someone else's review originally written for some Cannibal Corpse (death metal) albums.It's a pity the phony reviewer couldn't come up with anything more original than forging word-for-word another's content and then pasting it here as though it's a bonafide appraisal.Furthermore, he likely hasn't even listened to this song other than the sample provided here--which doesn't do the song any justice whatsoever. This is trolling at its finest folks, so just ignore it. But do enjoy the irony and humor on the way!As for the song, it is definitely for people who enjoy quality ethereal vocal trance. This song embodies just that. You will certainly find it a gem!Listen to this song and then judge for yourself.(P.S. This same phony review can be found under the DJ Encore feat. Engelina album entitled ""Intuition"")"
3,Arguably better than no backgammon game at all,"The back of game box states ""3 Board Choices"" and pictures two. You only get one board. You have to buy a $29.99 upgrade if you want the other two boards. There are four skill levels: 1- Computer (easy) 2- Neural net (competitive) 3- Random 4- Human. With human you manually enter the moves for both players. I haven't really played a full game on random. With ""Computer (easy)"" the IA is very conservative and non-aggressive. Easy is VERY easy. As for ""Neural net (competitive)"", it cheats with obviously self-serving dice rolls. In Backgammon the rolls are obvious. In Acey-Duecy they're ridiculously blatant and continuous. You can keep the game honest or do some cheating of your own by using the Manual Dice setting which gets real monotonous."
2,I love to play backgammon but.....,This is the worst game software I a have played ever. The rolls are unrealistic. It rolls whatever it needs to keep each player advancing bit by bit. I win over all about twice as often as the best opponent they have but am always very frustrated when it just starts rolling doubles at the end to get the desired outcome in score that it wants. I am equally if not more frustrated when it gives me a run of doubles to outplay my opponent. It can often take 20 rolls of the dice to get back into the game when the entry area has 4 open spaces to land on. I wish someone would come up with a decent Backgammon software package.
2,Dice rolls not random.,"This game has three difficulty levels, and after playing this game a lot, I have the opinion that the only thing making it more difficult at the higher two levels is that the dice rolls are not truly random and of course, it does not make a mistake. In a human to human backgammon game on the kitchen table, the rolls are going to be random and each human is going to make a few errors. This is a good way to get some practice if you are by yourself, but at the higher levels quickly becomes frustrating to win 1:10 and I do not think is worth more than $10. with shipping."
3,Better go for the upgrade,"I bought the version of the game without the upgrade. It's way too easy to beat. It's like playing against someone who has absolutely no clue how about backgammon. I wonder if the programmers even know how to play backgammon. The only way to lose is if the opponent gets lucky and outrolls you. And even then, all you have to do is hang around long enough and the opponent eventually will leave himself open. I'm going to go for the upgrade when I get the money together. Hopefully the upgrade will include opponents that know basic backgammon strategy. Beyond that, the background music is kinda cool in an Olde English kind of way and the voices on the audio are unintentionally hilarious. They'll say ""jolly good there"" even when you make a lousy move."
2,Very disappointing,"After her two brilliant albums, ""Storm"" and ""The Violin Player"", this was just, well, a mess. The violin play was mediocre, and did not showcase this musician's capabilities. The strength of her earlier two pop albums were in the strong foundation of classical music, brought up to date with modern instrumentation and rythm. She has left that foundation here and ventured into a wilderness. Vanessa Mae shows she is an excellent musical technician, not a composer. The sound of this album relies heavily on pop echoes of the seventies disco era, without the underlying edginess and tension that gave that music it's attraction.Vanessa Mae should return to her roots. If this had been my first exposure to her, I wouldn't have looked further, and not been exposed to her better work."
3,Suprisingly Flat!,"Having been a Vanessa Mae fan for several years I was somewhat suprised at the apparent lack of effort she puts forth in her latest CD. I was excited about the prospect of a new release and was willing to pay the additional cost for an ""import"" after reading the previous four reviews. I listened to the CD for the first time today and frankly, I was disappointed. The CD has merit and that's why I gave it 3 stars. However, compared to previous works this one just doesn't stand up. You almost get the impression that she wanted to get something out there to make a few bucks. If I was trying to convince someone that Vanessa Mae is a talented artist that demands to be heard...this would not be the CD to use as an example. Sorry Vanessa, I think you're a great musician but you can do better."
2,Major Disappointment,"Although I'm a fan of her other works, I found this album extraordinarily flat and unexciting. The music is mostly trite, with little energy or passion, and much of it sounds like it was turned out on a cheap keyboard synthesizer. Most disappointing of all, the focus here is not on her violin work, which is sometimes hard to pick out-- if it's there at all -- but on vocals and other pieces which are pleasant in their own way...but not what you buy a Vanessa Mae album for. Pleasant background music, inoffensive, but with none of the spark that makes her other albums so great, and many pieces that are little more than violin-assisted disco"
4,WHERE STORM LEFT OFF..,"Quite simply, Mae's latest album takes off where her last one left off. She makes you wonder why rock and roll is associated with guitars, not violins.Once again, she weds a dizzying array of synthesized and generated sounds with violin playing of great warmth and dazzling virtousity. Expect beat-driven songs that combine her spiffy ability at the strings with various subgenres, as well as softer, more introspective pieces. The arrangements are classy as usual, and together with the well produced combinational elements, make for an entertaining album.Caveat: it may get a little monotonous, but if you enjoyed Storm you will likely find something on Subject To Change to keep you interested."
3,"An also-ran from Solti, but in stunning sound","Given Decca's wide-ranging sound, the CSO's supreme viruosity on aggressive display, an unbelievably precise chorus, and Solti's razor-edge phrasing, there are thrills to be had here. You can't really have a successful Flying Dutchman without two outstanding leads, and unfortunately Nomran Bailey and Janis Martin fall considerably short of that. Bailey has the right voice but approaches the role of the tormented Dutchman with dignity and reticence. Martin is simply inadequate technically. Despite the lovely timbre of her voice, she's cautious and her top notes expose considerable unsteadiness. In addition, there's a certain clinical coldness about the whole proceedings. You don't believe for a moment that you are in the oepra house, and een the chorus sounds as if they are reading form the score. Oh well, this recording is definitely one of Solti's alo-rans."
1,I would not buy this book again.,My review will be short and to the point. This book does not deliver what the title implies. If you just enjoy looking at pictures of pools in different settings -- then this book is for you. If you need what the title implies -- look elsewhere.
2,IT'S MISSING WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BUILDING A POOL,"This book does not contain the information necessary for building your own pool as it implies. This book contains only general inforomation on building and designing a pool. If you want someone else to design and build your pool and would like to have an understanding of what professionals are talking about, this book is good. This is by no means a ""how to"" book."
4,As If You Were There With Him,"I have read much history, and much about the Great War. Nothing I have ever encountered had the impact of this small volume. The war recored here gravely wounded our civilization, and in these pages you can see that wound at its creation."
3,my book review,i think this book was ok but that is my opinion. if you like books about people in the mountains this is a good book for you.
5,Peace & Contentment,"The book is one of the finest in it's gentle manner. Completely unassuming and non judgmental it recalls, in simple details many things treasured in childhood. Imagine your grandfather coming home from the coal mine, covered in cold dust, kissing the top of your head, with your brother standing in back of you cradeling a pitcher of water in a wash basin."
4,excellant track selectoin,"High Karate is a great unmixed compilation. The first song is a En Vogue cover with male vocals that will blow you away... The second song ""Scottie"" is brilliantly eerie ..made complete with Star Trek samples... I could go on about every track but all you need to know is that the selections are quality and its well worth the money"
3,Percy Mayfield,"Two songs, ""Please send me someone to love"" and ""The rivers invitation"". Once again I find myself buying a cd full of other stuff in order to fill holes in my collection. This time, there were some pleasant surprises along with the package. I never realized what a good blues singer Mr. Mayfield was. This one's wort the price of admission. Nice packaging, nice bonus."
5,Great performance,"I love this performance very much. Price is the most beautiful Anna singing with richness, purity and drama. Popp is also wonderful and golden toned as Zerlina. Sass is good, but is not conventional as Elvira. Imagine Callas singing Mozart.Personally, I thing Stuart Burrows has the most beautiful tenor voice I have ever heard. He is the Renato Bruson of tenors singing with tone that I can only describe as pure velvet...rich and creamy. His Lensky on the Solti Eugene Onegin is fabulous. I also really enjoy performances by Weikl and Bacquier as the Don and Leporello. Vocal acting is first rate!I also like Solti's conduting very much. I don't like a super ""light"" style that has no guts to it. I think that's fishy!Highly recommended"
5,Perfect for high school teachers,"Faced with the challenge of teaching a ninth grade linguistics course, I looked long and hard for books that could help me. Almost all linguistics texts are hundreds of pages long and pitched at way too complex a level. In this one, though, Paul Justice tells you exactly what you need to know, distilling but not oversimplifying the subject. The book is designed so that you can effectively teach yourself, with exercises and good examples throughout. Justice is a clear writer and explicator, revisiting important topics when appropriate, so that you see connections, and he always remembers to explain why what he's teaching you is relevant in a high school classroom. And like the best linguistics books, it's fun. My only complaint is that the on-line solutions to the exercises are only available to teachers who adopt the text for their classes. All in all, though, this book is a definite find."
3,Relevant Linguistics,"I had to purchase this book for my uni course. It is highly technical and goes way beyond what I need to know about teaching English. However, it would be a very useful resource for people studying at Masters Level."
2,Problems,"After a month the sound channels went out on this receiver and the output to my TV was only Black & White. Fortunately, there was a certified shop within 30 miles of my house. I brought it to them and they fixed it but it took them 2 months. After getting it back, the same problem happened again after about a month. I moved out of the country before I could get it fixed. Needless to say, I'll never buy another Onkyo. My pioneer didn't have this many problems."
4,"Very stylish, but functionality could be better","This is one stylish messenger bag, for sure. The padded shoulder strap is also a welcome addition. The interior main compartment is spacious, and easily fits a 15"" laptop. Disadvantages include some limitation in its organization and functionality. For instance, the organizational pouch is only one large mesh, zippered pocket. There is no dedicated pouch for pens, PDA, business cards, or cell phone. As a result, all these items sit in a common pocket and get jostled around. The haul/tote handle is awkward, as it is sewn to the rear of the bag but the center of gravity is towards the front. As a result, if you lift the bag by its haul handle, the whole bag tilts forward as if it will fall over (imagine your contents jostling around as it sways!) Overall a pretty bag, but others are more ""functional."""
2,Slack,"See that big bulge in the rubber on the top of the toes? When edging, that bubble flexes & lets the shoe stretch & slip backward. The toe of the boot actaully elongates when under stress.I wear a size 10 (US) running shoe & bought these in a 9. The lenght & width are properly snug but that stretch is unacceptable. If you live at Indian Creek & do nothing but climb pure cracks, these may be ok. Otherwise, they're sketchy on even a moderate edge.The upper shoe material is a bit stretchy & quite comfortable. Since they've been worn outside (1 day), Second Ascent policy won't accept the return. I'm currently emailing them and 5.10 in an attempt to return as a design flaw. If unsuccessful, they'll make a comfy gym shoe & that's about it. At least, until I get back to Indian Creek."
5,Great CD!!!,This CD is great!! Very catchy and have you hooked for more!Fav songs on the album*Car Alarm*Irish*Four Five*On To The Next OneAlso this band in amazing in concert!!! Tons of energy!
3,Needles Snapped in Half,"The quilting needles are the perfect size and the large eye is marginally better than average for threading, however, I was quite displeased that one after the other of them just snapped in half during normal hand quilting. One didn't last 10 minutes. I will not buy them again. I am down to two of the twelve needles left and will have to order more from a different manufacturer. Have been hand quilting for 30 years and this has never happened with other needles. Extremely disappointed!"
4,"Not as exciting as the first book, still worth reading","Opening scene is great, remainder is lessexciting. There isn't as much technicaldetail as in Direct Action.Still a great book in an excellent series!"
1,Erasure-I Say I Say I Say,I have never been able to listen to the CD I purchased. It was totally scratched when I opened up the package. It is too much trouble to return it-so I totally wasted my money and will never purchase CD's from Amazon again.
3,Beginning of the downward spiral,"I was disappointed with this album. It was worth the purchase because I really enjoy about half the songs, but on the whole it left a less-than-pleasing taste in my mouth. But just so you can refer this against your personal Erasure tastes, I judged this album against ""The Innocents"" and ""Wild"", which I believe to be their best albums."
4,great sounding reggae,"I first heard one of Eric Donaldson's tracks on a compilation CD and loved his raspy but smooth voice. His vocals are some of the best in the reggae scene. This is a very mellow but extremely easy to listen to CD, with simple but head nodding instrumentation. Listen to the first track and you will know what I am talking about. I must buy for a lover of reggae music."
5,Small and sturdy,"This is a nice product - fits in your pocket, and is sturdy and stable. I used it with both my camera and video camera."
2,Poor construction and waste of money!,"Won't stay up, Have no idea why they would design legs that would extend and not stay up. I could do better holding my camera on my knee. Don't waist time on this one. Get an old sears catalog to sit your camera on..."
1,This stand will destroy your camera!,"The mounting screw is too long.. long enough to wear if you tighten it down it will dig into your camera body. My camera manual specifically warns against this. Why the heck would they make the stud so long--ridiculous. I am sending this back. I bought this because it had all 5 star ratings, I'd give this ZERO stars if I could. And it does NOT support an SLR well at all, even with a short 50mm lens.. barely bump it and it will tip over.. the wind could easily tip it over cause it is so off balance. Also the thumb screw isn't easy to turn and you have to tighten it down hard to TRY to support the SLR."
3,velcro on the removable hatch?,"I like almost everything about this case except for one (near) fatal flaw: the velcro that holds your pilot in the case is required to be attached to the hatch that covers the expansion/memory card port! I often find that upon unzipping my case, the pilot has shifted position and the velcro has remained locked to the hatch, thus REMOVING the hatch. It got annoying after the 100th time. Also, I have big suspicions that this is what caused my palm pilot to do a hard reset and lose all of my information when I was on a trip."
4,Great for IIIx!,"This case is great for the IIIx. Unfortunately, it only works for the IIIc if you remove the flip cover. I don't go anywhere without the flip cover, so I switched to a different brand of case."
3,"Nice look and feel, but has it's flaws...","I really like the quaility leather used to make this case. It looks and feels great, but I have to agree with previous reviewers that the velcro holding the Palm in place can pull off the battery cover and cause the whole thing to fall out of it's case. This happened almost half the time I opened it to use it. Needless to say, it sits in my desk drawer now. It's unfortunate because other than that one design flaw, the case is made very well.One other thing to consider is that with the leather case on, you can't slip the Palm in your shirt pocket, which can be very convenient."
4,Good Case for the Palm,"The Zippedred Leather Case for the Palm III series is very good. You just have to ""break it in"". When you first put your Palm into it, it dosn't cute fit, and you'll have to remove to front cover. And who want's to remove the front cover. But use it and use it, and eventually the there is room for the front cover.The case is as I mention good, but why in the world haven't Palm made it just halv a centimeter bigger?."
3,Great... but it didn't live a year,"I am a very very deep sleeper, NOTHING ELSE WAKES ME UP, PERIOD. Once or twice it took my an hour or two to wake up from a nap due to exhaustion, and it has STOPPED WORKING IN 4 MONTHS. BUT while it worked it WORKED VERY WELL COMPARED TO SEVERAL OTHER SIMILARLY PRICED ALARM CLOCKS. I sleep with the vibrator under my shirt and on my neck because I don't sleep with a pillow and I can say if for some reason you don't wake up for an hour the vibrator over heats and stops working until it cools down and probabely will have a shorter life too. I've read there are newer versions that shut off before over heating made by the same company. Other alarm clocks wouldn't wake me up from my naps for hours while this one had my eyes open in a minute almost every time. You may need the 1 year warranty so save the box. As short lived as it has been I'LL BYE ANOTHER IF I HAVE TO because I've tried several others and this company is heading in the right direction."
4,Up and At 'Em,"Does the job! Numerals easy to read without glasses at night, alarm really loud but adjustable, and the shaker will get you up no matter what. I no longer need to worry about getting up on time."
3,Great but I'm a VERY VERY deep sleeper,This alarm clock is great except I definitely have to turn on both the vibrator and the buzzer. The vibrator itself is tucked into my pillow case but it doesn't wake me up alone. It is vigorous but I'm just a deep sleeper. I also wish it was able to have the radio as an alarm setting because I'm starting to sleep right through the beeping buzzer. If anyone has any suggestions for great alarms meant for very deep sleepers I'm all ears. =]
4,Excellent Product. I'm really satisfied with this.,Excellent Product. I'm really satisfied with this. Quality of FM radio is not that great though.
2,Not so super sonic,"This alarm is about as loud as any $10+ alarm at any pharmacy but the ""buzzy"" thing it comes with is like sleeping on your cell phone on vibrate without fear of breaking it lol. I'd say that its ok if you're a normal sleeper but if you work 2 jobs and sleep short hours or have some kind of disorder I'd suggest getting an expensive namebrand ""radio"" alarm clock and just turn the volume all the way up. All in all the alarms quality is poor and the snooze button is just like the other buttons and the volume starts off faint and works its way up to the same as a normal conversation in public BUT the vibrator(lol) does cause a good deal of shock and supprise if you don't mind sleeping on a lump(putting it under the matress its still noticable)."
2,Good...but...,I've had this alarm clock for a few years. The sound alarm quit working shortly after I bought it. But I found that I like being awakened by the vibration. Now parts of the numbers don't display which makes it hard to read sometimes. But it still gets me up every morning.
1,urgent,"was not loud enough slept threw it, and the vibration deal got hot very quik just need a return label plase"
5,great addition for any wood carver,"I have really enjoyed this book and used several of the plans. I have carved all my life, but recently decided to do some decoys. This book was a big help in getting head and neck shapes right."
3,slightly disappointing,"a little difficult to follow. all the spanish names and customs and types of people, this one needs a small glossary in the back. many words and phrases we just don't know."
4,Mexico in 1835,"Barbara Hambly's Benjamin January novels are simply wonderful. The research that goes into each one is truly amazing and this one is no different. In this book Benjamin and his bride Rose go down to Mexico to rescue their friend Hannibal who has been accused of murdering the son of his paramour's father. Once there they are thrown into dangerous intrigue and sadistic cruelty. Ben and Rose have never seen a family quite like Don Prospero's. And it appears that Hannibal did indeed kill the Don's son since no one else could have poisoned him, but Ben knows that Hannibal is incapable of murder and he and Rose set out to prove his innocence at no small risk to themselves. This was a good book and a good mystery, but I missed the New Orleans backdrop since all the book's action occurs in Mexico. Ms. Hambly is a master-storyteller."
2,Disappointment,"I loved the Benjamin January series. This one just didn't deliver the story or the characters that I expected. I couldn't relate to any of the characters and kept waiting for the story to pick up. Sad, because I was so looking forward to another story from Barbara Hambly. I think that perhaps it was that it was missing so many of the regular characters that have made up her previous stories and that it was set in old Mexico and didn't seem to have the mystery or romance of the earlier books.Next time...."
1,couldn't get through it,The reason I can't give stars is because I didn't read the book. I love this series. I love the characters and the history and New Orleans and the writing. And I thought I could get on board in Mexico- especially because it was set during the whole day of the dead festivities but I lost interest within 30 pages. I'm sure it's not the book or the story but I started to lose big interest when all these relatives of the Soprano started to get introduced. I just did not care about them and didn't want to meet them. I really enjoyed her in the previous book but had no interest in her extended family.I suspect this may not be a helpful review for anyone. Sorry about that.
5,Great CD!,Had this as a child (in cassette!). I got this for my daughter as I remember loving it. I remembered right! She loves it. Definitely recommend this for kids!
4,It's Red and It works,"Used this thrower while shooting with a fiend, he was doing the foot stomp, I was shooting. So. bought one for myself to use when alone. It was not hard to assemble if you keep the box handy. At some point while folowing the ""written, illustrated"" directions you will not doubt think you have been shorted one nut for the assembly of the trowing arm to the welded frame bolt. The nut can be located on the connecting link for the main spring. Put there to keep it from running around in that little plastic bag by those hard working commies. I'm 225 lbs. and i find it a little hard to stomp the release. This may be a draw back for someone, but I still think it's the best buy out there for a clay thrower."
5,Great product,"Awsome product, performs as described and easy to build. Very sturdy and made with good materials. I would definately use lock-tite on the bolts so they wont come loose after use. Other then that this kne person reap shooter is great!!"
4,better than most,"I bought this trap thrower from a pawn shop, it was in pretty good shape. The frame and main spring are solid, and can throw the clays pretty far. The machine has a pivot so you you can release the clays low, medium or high. The main spring can also be tensioned differently for different distances. The front feet are made so that you can dig them into the dirt. If you do not the can rattle. My only two caveats about the thrower is the release lever, and spring attached to the release lever. The spring is weak, and should be stiffer. Also the release lever is not very strong. If you do not adjust the chain correctly when you pivot the base for a different angle of throw can bend the release lever. It is very portable, and does not take up a big footprint. Everyone raves about how much better than using a hand thrower it is. Overall I am satisfied."
4,GREAT!,This works really well if you want to shoot by yourself because you are able to do both. The only down side was that the instructions weren't the greatest with putting it together but I finally figured it out and I'm very happy with it.
2,Trius 1-Step Clay Trap Thrower,I bought this trap and thou it appears well constructed the assembly instructions are mostly lacking. After two days of fiddling I still do not have it working. I cannot find adequate instructions on You Tube to get this dog working. Have now got it working and am now pleased with the thrower but still want to strangle the author of the instructions.
5,Simply the most beautiful book I have ever read my children,"This is such a wonderful book, my children just step inside this little girl. This sure is a conversation starter!"
1,Fine if you're looking for heresy,"Look, if you're a new-ager, this is the book for you. If you're trying to teach your children actual biblical truth... yeah, you should probably hit up another book."
1,Not Biblical,"I was looking for a Biblical storybook for our children, and from the reviews and the description, thought this one would be great. I was so disappointed when the book arrived and I read: ""And when God makes a person, a star, or a wave, A part of God stays with whatever God's made. So God lives in the sky, in the meadow and stream - God lives everywhere, and God isn't a dream. God lives in the frogs and the birds and in you. When you're looking for God, it's easy to do. God lives in all things that you see, hear or touch. God lives in all people. God's in each one of us.""This is just not true about the God of the Bible. There are many wonderful and warm parts to the story, but the lines I've quoted above are not accurate in light of what the Bible teaches."
5,This was a great and fun story to read with my 5 yr old.,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It has colorful pictures and my favorite part was the answers the little girl received to the question, ""Where does God live?"". I highly recommend this book!!!"
4,Surprisingly nice,"Purchasing this CD without hearing it previously, I was concerned that the early 1960's recording would lack quality. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The biggest drawback to this recording is the positioning of the microphones. Frequently the orchestra dominates the recording, sometimes overpowering or drowning out the singers. I like the tempo and the vocal performances are very nice. Die Walküre is an intense opera, and the performances reflect that sense of intensity. I have to give it a big ""thumbs up."" Not perfect, but pretty good."
3,Strange,"This is another strange book by Shirley MacLaine. It's written in her typical style of giving us all the details that we don't need like her squatting to pee. Aside from her graphic details, I also think she gets carried away with her spiritual findings. So maybe past lives exist and she remembers them but she gets to be privy to God's secrets that even Mother Theresa never got? It's a bit much to swallow but if you can get past this as her truth then it can be a fun read.Her writing style is easy and flows nicely. And she does write in such a way that you are on the Camino with her even if you don't agree with her spiritual truths (I'm sure some will but not me). The book does get you to want to go on The Camino one day too."
4,Shirley's Journey,"I loved reading this book and getting an a look at what it is like to walk the Santiago de Camino. Although one needs to dismiss the parts where Shirley is trying to avoid the photographers and reporters. I wonder if she may have missed something that she could have gathered from the walk by focusing, worrying, plotting and planning to avoid the paparazzi.One may find it a bit difficult to wrap your mind around when she talks about her dreams where John the Scot tells her about Adam and Eve, the Temple of Learning, the Lemurian civilization as well as the Altantean civilization, how the Great Spirit created soul mates and how the separation occurs.Overall it was an enjoyable read and good insight into the experience of the walk."
3,The Camino,I am really interested in the spiritual part of this journey but this felt too extreme. Can't relate to it.
3,Ok for first info on Camino,"I was looking for someone's experiences on their Camino journey, as I am considering it. I don't particular like Shirley MaClaine but someone recommended this. I'm glad I didn't pay full price. She is me-me-me so I skip over quite a bit to get to the meat.I continue to look for a better, less self-centered account. I have a Guide book that is good. By John Bradley. I recommend you start there first."
2,I TOO HAVE DONE CAMINO & MORE,"MS. MACLAINE NEEDS TO STOP SHARING HER ""BORED CELEBRITY IN SEARCH OF MEANING"" LIFE WITH THE REST OF US. SHE HAS MUCH TO LEARN. I SUGGEST SHE READ A BOOK CALLED SIGNALS HERE AT AMAZON. RATHER THAT TREK HER OLD BODY ON A SEARCH THAT SHOULD BE MADE WITHIN. THEN GO VOLUNTEER AT A CANCER HOSPICE FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME THIS TRIP TOOK HER TO MAKE."
1,passed up on the sale rack,"I will read just about anything about El Camino de Santiago. Walked it twice.... I saw Shirley on Oprah and thought I'd get the book. At B&N I found it on the sale table so I skimmed through it... appalling. A majority of the sentenced started with ""I"" and compound sentences were few and far between. It was like reading a story written by a child! Where were the editors? Needless to say, I put the $2 item back, never questioning why it was there."
3,A Review By a Fellow Pilgrim,I walked The Camino in October-November 1999. I enjoyed Shirley's book because I could relate to a lot of the places which she mentioned. I did not like a lot of the mystical portions. I give her a lot of credit for some far-out thoughts and beliefs. Although I support some of her beliefs she goes much further with them than I ever could. It's too bad that much of the enjoyment of her walk was spoiled by all the media attention. I am her age and it took me 37 days to walk the 500 miles so I suspect she is in much better shape than I am. It is a great experience and I would recommend it. It can be just an adventure as it was for me and it does not have to be a spiritual experience as it was for Shirley. Her book is very interesting and those who are contemplating the walk should read it.
3,Mind Journey,"This is another of those books where someone attempts to share their spiritual experiences with those who have never had a spiritual experience. I admire Shirley and her desire to aid others on their spiritual paths, but to attempt to get across what one experiences in their mind through a physical endurance process has long been the norm in all religions. Fasting, hours upon hours of meditation, physical/emotional denial are not the only way to prepare the mind for spiritual advancement.I would only recommend this book for reading by those whose spiritual level has been raised through their own efforts and would enjoy knowing there are ""fellow travelers"" out there."
1,...do not buy,"Shirley MacLaine combines Christianity, with modern chakra, astrology, and other doubtful ingredients, producing a sickening mixture of new-age garbage. Besides being semi-religious pulp, this book gives us a completely unjust and incorrect impression of Spain, the beauty of the Camino, and the people that undertake this journey.There are many good books about the Camino of Santiago like El Peregrino from Paolo Coelho, and The pilgrimage Road to Santiago, by David. M. Gitlitz and Linda Kay Davidson."
2,For Mac Laine devotees only.,"Hmmm? Let's see. Past Life Regression, Lucid Dreaming, Chakra Balancing, Guardian Angels, Lemuria, Atlantis, Soul Mates, Extra Terrestrials and what have I forgotten?Oh Shirley, I love you dearly but please stay out of those metaphysical bookstores!This book is strictly for Mac Laine devotees only. Everybody else can just sit on a park bench and wait for a crazy person to walk up and start talking to them. It's the same experience."
3,The Camino: A Journey of the spirit,"Interesting and enjoyable reading for about 2/3 of the book. Sometimes Ms. Maclaine's ""spiritual travels"" leave me in my own world, with the here and now. Just a bit too much."
5,Love Shirley,"I absolutely love this book but I also love ""Spunky"" Shirley. I like her style of writing and how well she portrays her feelings through words. I own several of her books and this is my favorite."
5,You Got It Right All Around,Thanks for shipping the paperback I ordered within the time-frame you promised. You did everything right - and the first time at that.
1,Don't encourage her...,"I have biked the camino three times. I know the camino. Believe me, Ms. MacLaine does not know the camino. Ms. MacLaine knows a lot about Ms. MacLaine and that is what she writes about. Her tale is extremely self-absorbed and has little about hiking in Northern Spain. If you want to read about hocus-pocus as experienced by Shirley, you may enjoy the book. If you want insight and planning information about El Camino de Santiago de Compostela, you will hate this book, as I did."
1,Ugh!,"Four stars? seriously? I'd give it no stars if that were an option. I love Shirley MacClaine and i have read other books by her but this book was plain DULL! I could not get through it to even finish I was so bored. Nothing much happens; she walks, talks to a stick, hollers at dogs, dreams, eats crappy food, wears stinky clothes, dodges paparazzis and that's pretty much it. I expected some sort of insightful, spiritual renderings but what spiritual insights i got from Shirley's book is what she dreamed and her intrepretations of those dreams. There were no fascinating tales on who she met (those she did meet were given superficial personalities and were glossed over as not that important) or where she stayed or what she saw; just endless babble describing HER strange beliefs which is fine but they had nothing much to do with The Way. I wouldn't pass this book on to anyone."
5,high preistess of lumaria,"I have been drawn to Shirley Maclaine since her first book came out in print, and have followed her literary skills inclusive of the Camino. Itwas this book that truly made me feel, and realize that there was more to her and my relationship. I have done some past life searchings and my beginning was in Lumaria as a high preistess, possibley when Shirley was there. So found this book to be right on target. It moved my very Soul to the depths of just what life is truly about,""LOVE"". If only we could all see life on this planet as Shirley does,how wonderful it would be. I would like to thank her for all her insight and courage to share with us her many travels on this plain, but mostly for her strength to walk the 500 miles over the Camino, an incredable feet. If you have not read the Camino you truly are missing the journey of the century.10 STARS FOR THIS ONE. THANKS SHIRLEY,I await your next endevour. Always, JOYCE"
1,"This book is fiction, right?","Because if it's not, it should me. Total waste of time for anyone looking to read a good travel memoir. You'd be better off reading Twilight. Frankly, I'm pretty surprised this book is rated 4 stars.Amazon, can I please get my money back?"
2,Don't read unless you love Shirley MacLaine,"Having done the camino myself I was eager to read this book. I am not a Shirley MacLaine fan, and I admire her for setting out to do this ardous juouney at her age. I found she shared too little about the actual journey and plenty about her inner journey. This is fine if you can imagine and believe all she believes. I can't. I personally hated the book."
4,Amusing Mescaline Dream--Unless You Believe,"Early in her 500-mile pilgrimage along Spain's Santiago de Compostela Camino in 1994, MacLaine began to hallucinate and see huge metal screws. ""I didn't know if that meant I had a screw loose,"" she writes.Walking some 20 miles a day, subsisting on yogurt and fruit, dogged by curs, mosquitoes and the press, little wonder the otherworldly 66-year-old entertainer had visions so strange she found ""it took an act of control not to roll my eyes at myself!""Her previously recounted past lives (as a suicide in Atlantis and an Indian princess) were lively enough; this time she witnesses the origin of the universe and meets the kindred soul who was both Charlemagne and Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, with whom she had an affair before his 1986 assassination. By turns fearful, vain and hostile, MacLaine makes her eccentricity endearing, even if you scoff at how the spirit moves her."
1,Wierd,"This is another wierd book by Shirley MacLaine: it is neither interesting nor a helpful guide book for pilgrims. The book is just a long rambling new age rant, published because the auther is ""Shirley MacLaine"". Too bad really. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Shirley MacLaine walking the hardship,"I like Shirley and have all her books. This one? No sir! It is a nice attempt on her part trying to pilgrimage among those not quite normal people she encounters on the ancient path of the Camino in Spain. Yes, I agree with her, dogs are dreadful creatures, but she doesn't realize how decadent man's best friend is. Would wolves have attacked or frightened her? No. The wolf is peaceful, quiet, respects man, has psychic dignity. The movie ""The Mexican"" shows Oscar winning superstars sitting on toilets. On the Camino you can find that too. Of course girls pull down their pants to ""make water"", even while on the Holy Pilgrimage, as all the girls who pilgrimaged before in history. Oh, Shirley! It was obviously a bit too hard for you, but you did it, anyway! Gerborg..."
3,Truth or Fiction?,"Shirley! You go all the way to Spain and I never really felt I could actually picture it in my mind. I never really FELT the refugios or tasted the oily soup or felt those blisters. It seemed more like fiction to me. The visions and revelations you experienced seemed like fantasy. I feel like you just scratched the surface and embellished a lot of this amazing journey. I am glad to hear however, that you've still ""got it"" - with all the guys still after you! I'm sorry but I was disappointed. I guess I wanted to learn more of the REALITY of this adventure than some of the same stuff from your last books. You don't have to preach to the converted. I admire and love you very much and I am glad your back safe."
3,On The Camino to Where?,"This book was well written and very interesting as all of Shirley's former books. But her reincarnation stuff really got carried away this time. It's hard to believe all her truths. Sometimes I'd think she's not all there but she does believe it's all true. I didn't think so although I enjoy her writing style and all her many adventures. I think she has lost touch with reality in this book. But if you like her, and I do, then you'll enjoy reading her latest claims or beliefs. And it was fun to hear all the little events and stories of others on The Camino--I never even knew about this place but it's making me desire to go there one day after reading all about it. I did enjoy reading about The Camino."
3,The Camino,"The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela has always held a fascination for me. Shirley Maclaine's book exemplifies why thisjourney holds such mysticism and the importance it has on discovering the deeper meanings of life. It does not sanitise the pilgrimage but delivers it raw and hard, difficult and dangerous, but also tremendously rewarding as each stage is completed and the goal becomes nearer. I have just reached the same decade as Maclaine, and she's almost thrown me down a personal challenge. A worthwhile read."
4,Shirley's Experience of the Camino,"I have enjoyed all of Shirley Maclaine's books. I appreciate that she is so candid with her beliefs and experiences. I listened to the audio version of ""the Camino"" and really loved hearing her tell her own story.Her experiences are very far out and may be found to be a little too much for some readers. However, if you are a seeker of spiritual truth from a metaphysical point you will be captivated.If you are looking for a down to earth story on a pilgrimage then this is not for you. However if you like Shirley Maclaines witt, intelligence, and openess, AND you are open to consider all possibilites, then you may very well enjoy this book.I also recommend ""Circle of Tears"" by Jeanne Marie Antoinette"
4,lrizer,The first 3 tapes were amazing-entertaining. I jumped in my car to see what will happen next. I want to walk the El Camino-find my truth. This was my first Shirley experience. The las tape was strange. I was unnerved-intriged-wanted more. I shared the tape and a friend may walk the El Camino.
3,Not Sure of its Authenticity,"Shirley Maclaine has down a power of good in popularising new Age themes and philosophies and this book continues in the same vein.It is a very intersesting account of her spiritual trek on The Camino but I must declare a slight feeling of scepticism when she accounts her dialogues with John the Scot..an entity from the spiritual realm with whom she has shared previous life adventures etc.and on her spiritual pilgrimage was guided throughout by his wisdom and care. It is, as she says herself, all down to our own spiritual experiences if such visitations are truly authentic....in my view I do not doubt her sincerity concerning her feeling that she was in true contact with the spiritual world and one of its inhabitants but it just doesn't ""ring true"" to me..so you really have to read it yourself to make a judgement concerning this..I beleive it is possible that such things occur but so many new Age exponents make it all sound so easy..and it ain't!"
5,The Camino,"This book answered my questions. I have read several books on ""mysticism"" (a misnomer in my opinion) and this just tied it all together. I had been looking for some information on Atlantis.The book is in excellent condition. A great read!!"
2,Dissapointed,"Instead of a factual tale of walking the camino and getting ready for it AND how to get there it is a book of spirits, chakras and other nonsense. If you are going to attempt the Camino this is not the book for you."
1,OMFG,"I'm going to also write a book on nuclear fission, auto mechanics and building skyscrapers. No wait, I don't know anything about those subjects either."
1,Truly superb puff pieces,"Considering that this administration has bought off journalists, threatened news media and lied to the public at every turn, it is no surprise that a collection of spin so far-reaching has made it into print. I did not have the heart to waste my hard earned money on it. The local library had a copy. Luckily no one else bothered to read it.As collections of refuse go, it is quite the production.We only have three more dreadful years left. I am sure that Aman Verjee has already begun his latest venture into political fiction. I can't wait to studiously avoid it when the spin doctors produce that collection as well.Seeing other reviews make me regret yet another decision by this administration. I really had hoped that Harriet Miers was on the bench. Her legal writing would have replaced the funny pages as my morning entertainment."
1,Envision Impeachment,"I bought the book looking for some humor, thinking it had to be satire. Beware, this is not humor it's intended to be taken seriously! What a bunch of tripe!"
1,This book fits right into what I believe,"that we should never, ever question our president in anything he does, and we should just accept what he does because he is the most smartest man in the world. If we question him, then we are traitors, giving aid and comfort to the enemy. So thank you, President Bush, for making it OK for people like me, who don't like to think for themselves, to feel like I fit into America."
