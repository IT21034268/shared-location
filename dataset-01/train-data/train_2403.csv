5,Beautiful Details for an Italian Charm,"I know a lot of people don't realize how small the Italian charms are, which is why this one is so impressive. Despite the small size, the details are beautiful. It was my first charm in my charm bracelet, and I love it! I'm getting another in the month of my best friend's birthday, too!"
5,GOOD,"GOOD BOOK, COVER AND CONTENT ARE SATISFYING. I RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS BOOK. WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD"
4,Fun and easy,"All the books in this series are user friendly and the activities use materials that you have on hand. I have often referred to them when trying to occupy my 3 year old son in a way that is also fun for me. In fact we played the float-a-boat game today. In addition to the actual activity, the author also gives little hints designed to improve your child's problem solving skills. My only disappointment is that these books are not as readily available as they once were."
1,product not received,I never received the product and have contacted my credit card company to dispute the charge.
5,Great Auto/Truck Electrical Tape,Recommend this product sold on Amazon which is not always found in the Hardware or Home Stores.Reliable name brand product for electrical and automotive use.
1,Misleading Picture,"The picture for this product is misleading as is the information on Amazon.com. The information and picture both made it appear as if this game was the 1996 version of ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"", however when I received my copy I received the 2001 version of the game which I did not want. If you are looking for the 1996 version, this is not it."
1,False Advertising!!!,"I has hoping to get the game I played with as a kid in the 90s but this is not it. They should really let the buyer know what they are getting before they buy it, change the image and title shieeet. Very disappointed! I don't think they sell it on here on amazon as far as I've looked for it but I did find it on ebay :3"
2,Leaky - waste of money,This is a pretty pan with a big quality problem - it leaked from day one and due to the leak problem sits pretty much unused in my pantry.Save your money - buy a better quality product.
3,Good for the price,"I make a lot of cheese cakes and have tried several brands of springform pans, ranging in price from $5 to $30. While all of them have produced decent cakes and released the cake the way they are designed to do, you do get what you pay for. This pan is a good compromise. With a non-stick coating and glass bottom it holds and releases the cheesecake as good as any. The glass bottom helps the crust crisp up better than non-glass. The compromise comes in with over-all quality. The entire pan, including the glass bottom, is noticably thinner than my more expensive pans. The latch to release the sides does not operate smoothly, sticks half-way through the action. If you want a springform on hand but don't want to pay for a top-quality pan, this pan will suite you well."
5,smart microwave,"I have never had any problems whatsoever with this microwave. I've had one in my apartment for a couple years, using it almost every day. I bought one for my parents and it's been solid for them as well.It's probably the smartest microwave I've used, too. You can set the kitchen timer while the unit is already microwaving, and vice versa. Pressing +30 seconds will start the microwave immediately, and you can continue to press +30 seconds to add more time. Have you ever used a microwave that doesn't allow these functions? It's a nightmare. Also, you can press one of the preset buttons and just walk away; the unit will start microwaving after a couple seconds.No problems with heating, either. It does what you expect it to. Clean and intuitive user interface. You won't be able to change the alert sound, but that's because this is a microwave, not an f'ing toy."
1,Horrible,"Worked well for the first year. I got it as a family microwave for x-mas 05', broken late feb 07'. The glass turntable is on a PLASTIC holder with PLASTIC wheels for support. The plastic melted in the back and caused a fire, it left the entire unit full of smoke and I think melted the glass!? Either way even for the price it's a not very good, I'm going to be caustous with my next GE purchase as well.."
5,Never had any problems,"I've been using Sitram for several years, and I've never had any problems. The stuff is built for the food industry - no frills and no fancy packaging, but it will stand up to use and abuse.The company changed hands a couple of years ago, and for a little while during the transition their customer service was suffering. Don't let that detract you from buying this cookware.(My only beef is that they've discontinued the Magnum Pro line, which was the only copper-based line that also worked on induction. Dear Sitram/Freiling folks - please, oh please bring it back)."
3,of course its kill em all,"To the reviewer who pointed out that this album is Kill em all....of course it is.....This was the initial cover to the album we know as Kill em all, however when they went to widespread distribution, the record exec's veto'ed this cover....this prompted Cliff Burton to name the album ""kill em all"" in reference to the exec's which blocked this cover.....this is a collectors item...but to be shocked that this is basically just Kill em all means you didn't do your homework"
1,Buyer Beware,This IS NOT a Compact Disc as stated. I was shocked to open this big box with a record in it. Do people still have record players? I feel very duped.
3,Nice but small,"This tray is attractive and lighweight, but a bit on the small side. At my home, the kitchen is upstairs and the dining area is downstairs. I need a tray that can accomodate more stuff."
4,A great bit of history,"If you are an OSU fan you need to get this DVD. The 1968 team is one of the greatest in the history of college football and definitely one of if not the greatest teams ever at the Ohio State University.Watch Rex Kern, Jim Otis and Jack Tatum lead the Bucks in a thrilling win over the O.J. Simpson led USC Trojans.The only reason I've rated this DVD with 4 stars and not 5 is because of it's bare-bones nature. This is definitely a great game and worth getting but the DVD has the game and only the game. There is nothing to round out the presentation - No half-time show, not even any commercials (which I think would be cool to see from 1968).But don't worry, if you are an OSU or college football fan this game is worth the price."
4,Great,"Simple, inexpensive and works well. I make long distance calls form my laptop where ever I have a network."
3,Not as advertised by Amazon,"The Philips phone is fine, but the description listed by Amazon is not accurate. I guess I should have known not to believe that a CORDLESS VOIP phone would be available for $20. I returned it, went to a local store and paid $40 more, and now have a cordless VOIP phone. I don't quite understand the advantage of having a phone hooked into a USB port over a pair of headphones, which I already have."
3,Plasticky yet cheap,"The phone has the weight and feel of a TV remote from a very cheap TV - and not a flatscreen. It's so insubstantial, I could accidentally sit on the whole unit all day and not notice.It also behaves very strangely, by mysteriously adding and removing numbers when dialing. For example, if I dial 2125551010, it will sometime truncate the number to 15551010. So I have to dial from Skype to be guaranteed I'm not calling some psychopath in another state.And then there's the sound quality. Well, I'm not sure what's changed but the quality I'm getting is lousy. I've tried it on 4 PCs now and there's a torturous machine-like hum the only the callee can hear. I thought nobody wanted to talk to me, and it was apparently due to the incessant and draining hum of the phone rather than me."
3,Good for the price,"The quality of the calls are pretty good, the quality of the phone is on par with the price. Having a little problem with the software it doesn't load with skype every time, it says its not compatible with vista (old software i think). There maybe an update somewhere but haven't spent much effort to find it. I mainly bought phone to try out skype and have upgraded to the better Phillips phone and am very happy with it."
2,Good for travel,I had used Skype with a mike/headset for nearly 4 year when I got the Philips VOIP080. And I'm impressed with it. it does not having MS VISTA SOPPORT. :(
1,worthless phone,"If you want to buy this junk go ahead, I wish you all the best. I purchased this product couple of weeks ago and it did not work. There are way better products than this."
1,Horrible,"I bought this phone for my business, and it worked great for about a week... Then Skype updated and the phone didn't. Ever since then, we have had about 70% of our calls not have audio (in or out, depending on what it wants.) It no longer rings when a call comes through, and it's constantly popping up errors on the screen. Might be good for some people, but not for people with more than light use. We paid $20 for it at Walmart, and I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,Philips VOIP0801 USB Travel Handset does NOT work with Macs,In the technical details the important missing detail is that this product does NOT work with Apple Macs. If it worked I might be able to write a glowing report. But is very expensive for Mac users because it doesn't work at all and AntOnline does not give a refund if you buy it from them.Philips VOIP0801 USB Travel Handset
5,Good show,My mom bought this tv show and she loves it. Plus the price helped sum 2. My mom cant get enough of the game.
4,The game,I glad I finally received the season.....I received them on the exact dated that was summited to be arrive time. I give this review a A+ and recommend people to purchase from this person or store.
4,GOOD,I BROUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND BUT IT IS A GOOD SET. AND WORTH PRICE; NOW ALL BET NEEDS TO DO IS ADD SEASON 4 FOR A COMPLETE SET.
5,Love This Show,The game chronicles the lives (good & bad) of football players and the women who live them. This show was very funny and worth every penny.
2,Karen's,"Great product, not much can go wrong with your standard loofah dog toy. It's a stuffed plush tube. That being said, this company was terrible. I got my shipment late, I ordered 4, the packing slip had 4 on the item quantity but got one. After a sincere apology from Ozbo ( product from multipet international, shipped by Ozbo) they said they would ship the remaining three ASAP. A few days later I got 1 more loofah dog, packing slip said 3. I guess you get the picture .... I emailed ozbo requesting the last 2 dog toys be sent. They promptly cancelled the rest of my order and refunded me approximately the correct amount. I guess I got a brush off from them because they can't count when they fill orders. I suppose my four dogs could to share the 2 loofah dogs, Ha! Never."
1,Still have not received the item,I ordered the tower on November the 14th and as of today January 13 I still have not received it. When I track the package it tells me it will be delivered by January 19th. My baby is due any day now. We cannot finish the baby room because we have nothing to put the babies clothes in. It makes me very angry when I see the estimated time for delivery on this tower is 5-7 days. Don't believe that for one second. I will write another review once it arrives to let everyone know if it was worth the wait. That is if it arrives.
1,Storkcraft,"I didn't buy the Beatrice combo tower, but I did buy the Storkcraft Aspen stages crib that Storkcraft makes, and I tell you what... There were nicks and paint scratched off all over it, when I got it, the box was damaged. One of the legs was backwards, so I had three front legs and one back leg. It took me five weeks to get the crib, then I couldn't put it together. I called storkcraft three weeks ago and I still haven't seen the leg... I too have a baby coming in a couple of weeks, and I will ask for a refund if the leg does not get here soon. It is currently sitting on the nursery floor waiting to be put together.... I DO NOT recommend Storkcraft...."
2,Good Looking but Bad Durability & Customer Service,"No denying that this is a good looking ""Changing Table/Cabinet/Chest"". However, it took us about 6hrs and 3 people to assemble it as the instructions for the same were least helpful. Despite all the man hours that went into assembling, it was still unfinished as there were a few screws missing and a few that could not be used anywhere. For Example we have only one knob fixed to each draw as the screws don't fit. We tried calling the customer care number at Stork Craft, but in vain as we got through with great difficulty once (when we were told that they will be sending the missing parts - this never happened!) and subsequently never got through. Finally we have given up on trying to reach them but continue using the piece of furniture as we do not have the time and energy to disassemble and return it. Finally a bad ""Baby Product"" being sold by Amazon."
1,Disappointed,"When we received our package I was sure the whole thing would be damaged. The box was open and torn up. Luckily, when we opened it none of the pieces were damaged. This dresser was the worst thing I have ever spent money on. I know it wasn't super expensive but I expected it to at least be decent. The instructions are terrible, the quality is poor, the middle drawer does not go in correctly and I cant even get the door to the tower on completely because the screws dont line up. After it was finally assembled we went to move it into the nursery and the bottom collapsed. We will be throwing this out and looking for something else. BIG WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,low quality,I can't believe that this piece of furniture costs what it does. It is definitely not worth the price. It seems cheaply made and lots of the pieces I received had paint missing or damaged sides. They should definitely consider better shipping materials. I would never buy this brand again!
2,DAMAGED,THERE WAS A CRACK DOWN THE SIDE WHERE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND NICKS IN THE WOOD. WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SEND IT BACK AND THEY ONLY OFFERED US 20.OO FOR A DISCOUNT. VERY DISSASTISFIED! WILL NEVER ORDER FORM HERE AGAIN
1,Horrible Product,"This piece is horrible. The fasteners are shoddy and the ""wood"" is awful. The screws sent for the drawer pulls are too long so the pulls wobble. We had to use our own drawer pulls that we had bought for a different use. The finish on the ""wood"" peels off with your fingernail."
3,Looks nice but...,This looks nice when it's set up but a few things wrong with it. First when we put it together the wood split and he made it a point to let me know he wasn't using anything other then a regular screw driver. Lucky it was on the bottom so not to noticeable. Second the long door was very hard to get on just right so you could open and close it. Even now we still have a little trouble opening it if it gets closed all the way. Also the handles are screwed in all the way and still seems loose to me. A simaliar looking one for double the price had about the same ratings as this that's why I went with the cheaper one and all in all it looks fine and I'm sure it'll hold but it's not the best but for the price I'll live with it.
2,Would not recommend this item.,"This is a very cheap piece of furniture. The finish is super thin and easy to mark up, it came with a few marks I was not able to fix and I will probably have to repaint the whole thing in a year or two. The drawers are flimsy and I had a hard time getting the door to fit on properly.The item was easy to assemble although it did take about 3 hours. You will need to pre-drill holes to attach the back, or switch to small nails instead of the screws provided.I would not recommend this item if you want something sturdy for a kid's room."
4,Stork Craft Tower Chest,Easy to assemble but time consuming. One crossmember piece was missing on arrival but after calling the company the piece was on its way quickly. I would have no problem ordering from seller again.
2,You get what you pay for it,"That pretty much says it all. It looks great, it worked wonderfully for the first 7-8 months, then it started falling apart little by little. By the time my baby was 13 months old, the Beatrice dresser/changing table had the bottom drawer completely off its railing and the backing falling down bit by bit. So, even though the price is right, if I had to purchase a changing table all over again, I would not buy this piece. I'd spend a little more and get a better quality item. However, I did purchase a Storkcraft stages crib and that item is still in wonderful shape... so, maybe it was just a fluke that the combo dresser/changing table didn't work out so well? Who knows! Good luck with your decision!"
3,It's alright...,"First of all, this looks much nicer in a photo, but that's not a big deal.Pros:Price - This is less expensive that most other dresser/changing table combos that I found out there.Hutch - Nice addition to have! Not too many dresser/changing table combos have a hutch that can be attached. The only issue with the hutch is that I don't see an especially secure way to attach it to the changing table combo. Looks like it only attaches in one spot on the side...Cons:Soft surface - I read a review of someone who said that you can make a dent in the furniture with your finger nail. It's 100% true!Overall quality - the screws continue to turn even when they're in all the way. Not sure how many years this will last.Knobs - don't tighten at all. We will probably get our own knobs that actually screw on tightly!If I had to do it all over again, I'd still buy it. I just don't see spending 3 times as much for a changing table combo."
5,Great Changing Table!,"I read some of the other reviews and purchased this anyway because it was exactly what my wife and I wanted. I think living close to the warehouse helped; the table arrived in only 2 days and was in great shape. I'm not sure if this was a change in the packaging, but the box was actually packaged in another box with wooden corners. The packaging was done very well.The table itself took me about 1.5 hours to assemble, and was fairly easy. There were a few troublesome spots where the instructions were a bit confusing, but once you get into it you can figure out that you missed something and fix it. Watch the screws that secure the back panel pieces; make sure they go in straight otherwise they'll poke out on the inside.The wood itself is like a particle board, but the finish is amazing! It's hard and durable looking (and probably durable, but since I've only had it a day I can't say for sure!). It looks great and doesn't look cheap at all."
1,Packing is Horrible!!,"I ordered the changing table combo tower along with the other matching furniture pieces. When I received the combo tower, it was poorly packed. After opening and pulling out a few pieces, my husband and I discovered that there were several damaged pieces. I called customer service at Storkraft and they were nice but they stated that I would do better by returning it to the store I purchased it from or I could wait 3-4 weeks before they could send the replacement parts for those that were damaged. On top of that, the CSR stated that the new parts sent may not match. So my husband and I are furious. We spent well over $1000 on our nursery furniture and have to send the first piece we received back. We have since then cancelled the rest of our order."
1,Just awful,"Really, just terrible. Pieces damaged in the box, and obviously not as a result of shipping, given the careful packaging. Just shoddy manufacturing and careless quality control. I couldn't even get all the parts out the box without filing for a refund, there were so many damaged pieces."
1,Never again.,"I bought this piece from Stork Craft while awaiting my newborn baby. The first one they shipped was the wrong style and color. So I had to wait two more weeks to get this product that when we put it together cracked and split at almost every screw hole. The funny thing is, is that we have the matching crib that is built beautifully and sturdy. This Changing table/dresser is not."
2,Damaged on arrival,"We got this dresser for my daughter along with the 4 piece dresser. Once assembling, we noticed some damage. Some of the damage looked like it was done before the finish, but they put the finish over it. It other parts where it was damaged, it wasn't where it was noticeable once assembled. It also scratches very easily.Overall, it is functional and looks nice."
2,Less than I expected!,"I ordered this product not expecting much at all and was even less impressed when it arrived. Ikea has better furniture than this.Just to make it clear, there is NO wood parts in this furniture, it is all pressed wood except for one support beam in the back. The wood feels flimsy and scratches very easy. There will be a dent if you put something heavy on top of it. I am a very handy person and it took me over 4 hours to put it together. The way the item is arranged is very disorganized and they need to learn from Ikea because I can put together Ikea Furniture in about an hour.IMHO, I would pass on this. I know the price is good and it looks decent in the picture but you can find something better. I am going to keep it only because I spent so long putting it together that I don’t want to waste another 5 hours taking it apart."
3,"Great delivery, service, fair product","Although I received this item quickly, was able to put it together without much difficulty and was able to order an extra screw without charge, the overall product quality was inferior to what I expected. The wood on the highest level top shelf is scratchable with the fingernail and most of the parts are not solid wood. I guess for the price it's a fair deal, though."
1,Customer service does not exist.,"I will not buy another Storkcraft item. There customer service department is extremely poor. We have been waiting for a replacement part for weeks. I called after the 3 week waiting period had passed and was told by a representative that she did not know when the part would ship. I asked to speak to the supervisor, the representative transferred me to his voice mail. He was not in, but she did not offer that information to me. I called back and asked not be be transferred to his voicemail, it was another representative that told me he was not in. Why couldn't the first rep I spoke to tell me that. I spent a total of 25 minutes on hold in placing just two calls. I am now in the process of emailing the company and calling the supervior on a daily basis until I get some satisfaction."
3,A little pricey for the trouble...,"I hesitantly purchased this item because my husband and I have a hard time agreeing and we both liked this style. Ultimately it looks wonderful, but it took us 3 hours to put together. The instructions are in pictures which are suprisingly harder to understand than words!The pieces don't fit together perfectly, but I'm satisfied with the result. If i had to do it again, I would probably spend the extra money and get a higher quality table in hopes that it would go together easier.***UPDATE ***10 months later. . . It's still held up remarkably well! I really do like this item. I've forgotten how difficult it was to put together, now it is just a very nice piece in my son's room that's the perfect height for me as well as my husband."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"Received the chest in 12 days, just as promised. We took everything apart and checked each piece to note any damage. Out of all the pieces there is one minor scratch that will not be noticed unless you take a magnifying glass to the piece. Overall very pleased with the quality. There is alot of solid wood along with the manufactured stuff. Not much diffrent than the same dressers you will find at Babies R Us. Unless you go to the very high end solid wood furniture that would cost well over 3 times this price it is a very good value. Checked all the nuts and bolts. Everything is there. If you want a decent looking nursery piece that will function for you after baby is older you would be hard pressed to find something less expensive with better quality. We received the matching hutch which was in good condition also. As far as the size of the changing pad, Target has one that is 30"" long. It seems to fit this chest."
4,Beatrice Tower,"I received this product (Beatrice Tower) sooner than I ever thought and I was pleased with that part. When assembling the product, it was easily assembled until we got to assembling the drawers and realized that the sides of the drawers were all for the left side and none for the right side! I called the manufacturer's number that was on the instruction sheet and they have agreed to send the correct sides for the drawer assembly. Hopefully, I will get them soon so my new granddaughter will be able to have this beautiful piece of furniture in her room. The wood had a few dings and knicks on it, but like others before me have written, I plan on using a black magic marker for that part. Otherwise, I am sure we will enjoy this product and it will be a great addition to my granddaughter's room whenever I finally get the correct parts! The price was very acceptable, so I hate to complain too much!"
2,Poorly crafted,"The chest itself is a beautiful piece of furniture for any nursery, however, I was so disappointed when i put the chest together, none of the drawers lined up, the pre-drilled holes for assembly werent in the right spots. The whole chest is crooked now. Very disappointed."
1,Missing essential pieces,"I was so excited to get this dresser, however, in the long and complicated process of putting it together, we discovered that there were several essential pieces missing. Furthermore, some of the pieces don't match the descriptions in the directions."
3,"Came on time, easy to put together",Our changing tower in Cognac came on time and was easy to assemble. The directions were very clear. There were a few dings in the wood but not severe enough to have it replaced. We were also missing a drawer knob...unless we dropped it somewhere. I called Storkcraft customer service and got a busy signal. So currently I am awaiting a response via e-mail in regards to getting a replacement door knob. I'll keep you posted. Other than that the tower is put together and looks very nice with the matching crib. Looks just as sturdy as the tower we almost bought for over $500. Best of luck to all the parents out there trying to purchase baby furniture!
1,disappointed!,"Very unhappy with this product. Like another reviewer stated the dresser cracked at almost every screw hole. We had to make our own holes to affix the door as the holes were in the wrong spot by several inches.A year later its falling apart, the front constantly falls off the drawers and the knobs keep falling off too.We too have a matching crib (Ariel) and its built wonderfully and was cheaper than these drawers!Buy something else!"
2,"Drawers are awful, poor instructions","The color is just what I wanted however, the changing table part is quite small. The changing pad hangs over about an inch. The drawers are anything but smooth and were a headache to put together, they keep getting stuck. The drawers are also very small. The instructions were a bit confusing and some of the pictures were incorrect. I am just crossing my fingers that this piece of furniture will last at least a year. The smell is quite bad, thankfully the baby has not arrived yet and we can ventilate her room. If it had not been such a pain to assemble it would be going back."
1,POS,"I'm not a complainer, but this thing was really a piece of ... junk. It arrived damaged. Amazon wouldn't take it back but they gave me $40 off. It took my husband a looonngg time to assemble, and he's a whiz at stuff like that (Ikea furniture, etc.). I'm just disappointed every time I look at it - save yourself the $ and trouble and buy something else."
3,storkcraft,The pieces Came scratched. Not very happy wish i would have spent more money to get a nicer set. Unhappy
3,What are the dimensions?,Could someone who owns this bureau already give the dimensions? Thank you so much!
2,"Had to ""fix"" it.........","Loved the way this dresser looked online, but when we recieved it, it's color was a bit different. It had a ""pinkish"" hue in the color and looked like it wasn't stained with a clear finish like my other furniture in ""natural"" finish. The directions were HORRIBLE and the top drawer wasn't cut right and actually overlapped on one end! We had to sand it down to make it even. I was really dissapointed as I was really looking forward to getting a nice dresser for my daughter. :("
4,A little disappointed,"Although this chest is beautiful, it took quite some time to put together and there were scratches in various places. Many of these scratches are visible from the front of the unit. I am quite satisfied with the space available in the chest, but very disappointed in how scratched it is."
4,Beautiful dresser/changing table,"First of all, despite some of the other reviews I read I had no problems with shipping. The item was immediately delivered after I ordered it. The box and the condition of the pieces inside were flawless. We put this together in a couple of hours and I love it!!! The drawers are long and deep and hold a lot of the baby's things. I also love the side cabinet with the shelves. It is perfect for holding baskets and other items. It is very sturdy and good quality. This will be a piece of furniture my daughter will have for years to come. Especially once she is old enough and we are done using it as a changing table, we can purchase the hutch for additional storage."
1,Storkcraft Not Worth the Headache,"My wife and I ordered this combo changing tower along with the matching crib and armoire, and we were EXTREMELY unsatisfied with ALL 3! All 3 pieces came with parts broken, and this changing tower came without a single fastener in the entire box. We returned the armoire and changing tower to try again, but when we got the second shipment in, we had the exact same problem again. The crib had enough pieces in tact that we were able to only order replacement parts. However, the replacement parts also came broken. In 6 attempts to ship us furniture, Storkcraft failed miserably all 6 times."
3,dresser is great but buy from Walmart instead,"Hi, we bought this dresser from Amazon.com/babies r us and they sent the wrong colored dresser. We got white instead of the oak one. We have been trying to return it but we are getting no where with them. We have been waiting for about 3 weeks for the return lables and still have not gotten them. When you call the number you never get a live person. You can get this dresser at walmart and would highly suggest getting it there. The dresser was shipped in a timely fashion, all the parts were there, it was easy to put together and it came in excellet shape. I have absolutly no complaints about the product just don't buy from here."
4,very sturdy,"this is a lovely combo tower......was shipped few days then we expected & easy to put together.....well, it was missing some parts but the customer service is real good (the only reason why we rank it 4 stars)....called them & gave the serial # & with no questions asked they shipped the part right away.......my wife & i love the space that it provides & it is pretty durable to scratches and water spills, we moved & there's not one scratch on it (we're not professional movers by no means).....looks great w/ the rochester crib....would recommend to anyone"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE STORKCRAFT,"My mother in law purchased this item for me as a shower gift in July. In September we were notified that we would not be receiving it. Not only did it take two months to receive notification, my attempts to contact the manufacturer (Storkcraft) went no where. The worst part is that I had orded the hutch to go along with it, which is now sitting in my hallway in the hopes I will find another unit for it to fit. We received no explaination as to why this item was no longer available, and I am now weeks away from having my baby and have to shop for something else. I would advise everyone to avoid buying anything from Storkcraft."
2,Not worth the frustration!!!!,"I ordered this product over 2 months ago and I am still waiting for a replacement piece to the dresser!!!! I decided to order the dresser from babyage instead of babies r us to save on shipping, unfortunately the first time we received the dresser there were 7 broken pieces!!! After sending the dresser completly back another 3 weeks later we recieved the next dresser which once again had broken pieces, this time after getting no kind of customer service help from babyage I had to wait 2 weeks just to get a request on the part being shipped out!!! It's been weeks and I still havn't recieved the part, so the dresser has been sitting in my babies room in pieces for months and I'm due in a week in a half!!! You would think for all the money you're spending on a little baby dresser Storkcraft could pack their boxes a little better!"
4,Good deal,"Ordered this dresser for a baby girl's room. It arrived on time and in good condition. Assembly is straight forward, although there are a lot of pieces and parts to fit together. I put it together without help in less than 2 hours, but I've done a fair share of this type of work. The load bearing pieces are made of heavy wood. I'm completely happy with this purchase."
4,Beautiful,We received this product in a timely manner. Husband put it together rather quickly. Only issue would be that the top drawer on a rare occasion doesn't close properly but it's not a big deal at all. It's very spacious and has a wonderful look. I would recommend this to anyone who has a baby already or one coming.Feb 2013 update: The piece is very easily scratched. We had to move it up an inch and the piece just about fell apart. I am now searching for something more sturdy as I am afraid that even with a wall mount it may decide to fall apart.
2,Not great.,"I purchased this changing table for our first baby over the winter. At first the unit worked well, however, now that our baby is here and almost 7 weeks old it has already started to fall apart. Both of the faces on the bottom two drawers have fallen off and we don't even use them often, (I have only stored clothes that are too big in them). With a newborn baby, faulty furniture is the last thing my husband and I want to deal with."
3,its just ok....,"I purchased this for the upcoming arrival of my first child. I would give it 5 stars however, the predrilled holes to hinge the door do not line up, I am going to have to go and purchase a drill to make new holes."
3,Looks nice.....,"I bought this changing table/dresser combo and the matching dresser that goes with it. They look beautiful in my daughters room but they are very cheaply made. The drawers are shallow (which I knew before purchasing from other reviews), there are parts that never fit tightly together so there are gaps in areas, and after only a year, handles are falling off and depite super glue and guerilla glue they keep falling off. The main structure has held up fine so far."
5,So pleased with product & company!,"To start, the dresser looks amazing. Great quality for the price, fairly easy to assemble. A little time consuming, but most furniture is.The only problem we had was that the knobs were missing from our shipment. I contacted Amazon's customer service and was told they could not replace the knobs, but I either had a choice of returning the dresser and they would ship me a new one or they would give me a $20 credit. Since we had the dresser completely assembled, I didn't want to send it back and graciously accepted the credit thinking I could just buy some knobs. Before I did though, I checked with Stork Craft and let them know about the missing knobs and they are shipping them out to us for free! Amazing customer service from Amazon and Stork Craft. Normally I would be frustrated at having to wait and them being missing in the first place, but I am so happy with how it was handled I can't even complain."
4,Nice dresser - tedious to put together,"Overall we are very please with this dresser. It matches the crib we bought almost perfectly in color. The area to place the changing pad seems a little smaller than what I expected but we'll see how it fits once I get the changing pad for it. The assembly for it was a bit ridiculous and took my husband many many hours to put it together. Way too many small pieces and the directions are nothing but picture diagrams to follow making it confusing at certain points. Overall, it's a very nice dresser for the price and I'm happy with the purchase. :)"
4,Beautiful but has a smell....,This piece was beautiful ad very well made. Heavy!!!! Only bad thing is it has a strange strong smell...like a wood stain.
3,"not great, not awful","This isnt bad. The door to the tower part on mine didnt assemble perfectly the way it should but it's not very noticeable unless you know to look for it. We put our changing pad on top of this and the straps that are attached to the changing pad have totally scratched up the top of the dresser, so the ""wood"" isn't very durable. Now when our daughter is too big for the changing pad, the top of the dresser is going to need some work.Other that that, I knew it wouldnt be the most amazing product when I ordered it, but it looks nice and it's not falling apart, so it does it's job. I think it's a little overpriced for what it is, but after looking for a nice one of these for weeks, this was the best price for the size and color I wanted."
3,You get what you pay for,"This item looks great, but we bought it because it was cheap, and the materials are just that. All in all, we are satisfied, but in hindsight we would have done a bit more research."
4,none of the same shipping problems,"Didnt have any of the problems of the other reviewers, one small easily touched up knick in a side, but other than that, all parts accounted for and in good condition. Although, we're looking at a move and I am concerned about how soft the wood is, it will need to be protected more than normal to make the move in as good condition. Would have preferred a wardrobe and shelf on the shelving side, but overall, think we're going to be very happy with this piece"
3,Just okay.,"Item looks good on the outside, survived shipping fine and was quite quick to receive. Outside looks like natural wood (minor blemishes here and there, knots that look slightly discolored), nothing too bothersome. However, inside of drawers and cabinet are white. Would have been nice if they had specified that. Also, the directions are horrible. Many steps are missing, illogically ordered, holes pictured don't exist, while other holes that do exist aren't pictured at all. Worked out alright for us but could be too confusing for some. Basically, you pay for what you get. If you find something nearby that looks like what you want for a reasonable amount more I would suggest buying that piece instead. However, if you are limited by what is around you, this isn't a bad piece. It is quite sturdy and looks pretty good once you finally figure out how to assemble it."
1,Cheap,"Well, they say that you get what you pay for. That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less! If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine. If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this. Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board. Several pieces arrived damaged. We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it. If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart. Also, the drawers are very shallow. Don't expect to store much in this. It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it!"
2,New to me,"and recommended by a friend who likes Alfred Sung. It is a pleasant, fresh and slighly flowery fragrance, so good when it is sprayed but no staying power, a little useless. I would probably purchase Eau de Parfum the next time."
5,This Sitram Catering 5.4 qt. pot is a terrific stewpot,"This stewpot/braisier is an outstanding pot. I own it and use it every week. The size is very useful for a family. The pot has a thick copper core sandwiched between layers of stainless steel and is very responsive to temperature changes. Cleaning the pot is a snap in the dishwasher. If by chance something sticks, a little soak with hot, soapy water first does the trick.Sitram Catering Stainless Steel pots and pans are extremely high quality. They are used by professional cooks in France who do not put up with inferior equipment.I own a number of sauciers, saucepans, frying pans and pots from the Catering line and heartily recommend them all.1/16/08 Update: I do wish the prices on the Catering line had not risen as much as they have. The prices are on par with other high quality lines but the prices are no longer the great deal they used to be."
5,This DVD is NOT anti-anything! Watch it and see for yourself,"It's hard for me to describe the 9 million Americans and growing who have read The Da Vinci Code as a cultural cliché - Dan Brown's novel has resonated with many people in this country who are curious about the roots of Christianity and its development throughout history.As I watched this DVD, I didn't think Da Vinci Code Decoded was anti-ANYTHING. What Dan Brown and the other thinkers featured in this film discuss is who Jesus was - living as a Jewish man in Roman-occupied Palestine 2,000 years ago. To speculate on how Jesus, as a man, might have lived in his time on this earth - in no way shape or form degenerates my faith or the beliefs of millions of Catholics and Christians in this country and across the world.In fact, Henry Lincoln in the film explicitly makes this point.I say watch it for yourself, and make up your own mind. You probably will learn something new, I certainly did."
2,"Disappointing. Nothing revealed, nothing decoded","This was a poor attempt at capitalizing on the success of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. The book, which is wildly successful and has sparked controversy throughout the world, and the movie, which is milder but still controversial both attract a lot of attention. This DVD simply tries to take that attention and turn it in to profit for the producers.There is nothing profoundly interesting about this DVD. There is no new information and the DVD fails to truly point at the myths and facts from the book/movie. It merely states what the book says and why the book says it or what the book is based on without any corroboration.Truly disappointing to a conspiracy theorist at heart. I expected more."
1,DaVinci Excuses,"Dan Brown is so full of bunk that his breath smells bad! This is a compilation of much of the same garbage that he included in his book. He tries, not very convincingly to prove his points. Someone reading his garbage that does not have a strong Bible based upbringing would be confused by Brown's fiction. I would recommend any other DVD, preferably something more uplifting."
4,"Great, inexpensive product for slightly oily faces","I don't have really oily skin (which I honestly don't think this product is really intended for) and I very rarely breakout; my skin just gets a little oily in the t-zone (forehead, nose, not so much in chin). I use this product on a regular basis, just wash my face with it in the shower, and every other day or so use the Nivea for Men face scrub beforehand. I've noticed a definite reduction in the overall oiliness of my skin, especially on my forehead. I also use the Nivea Oil Control lotion afterwards in my t-zone and the moisturizer in the other areas of my face. This stuff works as well as I'd expect it to and it's not expensive at all. I'm very satisfied with it."
2,No better than the original Nivea Face Wash,"While still much better for your face than soap, I couldn't perceive any difference between this face wash and Nivea's original ""formula"". Save your money and pick up the original at most any drug store."
3,"It just didn't work for me, but it does for others. Try It.","Using this product made me more prone to break outs. If I use it for two days in a row it's Zit City on my nose and forehead, it seemed to increase the amount of oil. Oddly, this Oil Control product is not oil free. If I alternate daily with an oil free face wash that stopped the breakouts, but that left me wondering why I should use the Nivea Oil Control at all.All skin care products are subjective and need to match your skin - I don't know why, but this product just didn't work for me."
1,Bad,"Lettering on buttons wiped off immediately and did not work either, got good one for less in colors too that works great at another amazon vendor."
5,WORKS!,BUY IT ! this works and lets you get what you were looking for at an amazing price! thanks a lot ! the product works ! EASY intallatioN!
1,this company has NO tech support,"I used to love broderbund/the learning company/riverdeep. Their children's programs were the best. Unfortunately, they install spyware along with the program you bought. I have had to remove every one of their products from my computer to avoid crashes and spam. When I try to contact the company, they either ignore or send a form letter. The online 'help' system only sends you in circles, and the bottom line is, NOBODY will help you. Occasionally they will reply with an offer to upgrade for a fee, but it doesn't matter. The newer the program, the buggier it is, and they don't care. Don't waste your money."
4,"not a perfect match, but love Sitram","This isn't a perfect match for the Sitram Profiserie line--at least the lid we got wasn't. It has a cylindrical piece of metal bent into a handle instead of a flat piece like our other Profiserie lids (our other lids look like the picture here). The handle on this lid is shaped like the handles on the sides of our Profiserie pots. Other than that, it is the same shape as other lids, the metal finish matches, and it does the job right."
5,Best educational game ever!,"I got this game when I was in elementary school. Now I am in college and I wanted it again. I learned everything from this game. There were things in high school history class that I learned from this game alone. Even now in college I have to take history core course and I remember all these facts from this game that relate to my course, it's great. Plus it's really fun. Get this game for your kids because you'll never forget it."
1,Deceptive title,"I've never played this game and don't intend to..but I felt it was neccesary to review it for anyone who might think they might buy this and expect the '80s/'90s Time format. Obviously, TLC released it under its former title to increase sales, a shrewed but misleading tactic. They've turned Time, by far the most difficult version of the classic Carmen games, into a predictable adventure game. Kids who've reviewed it here seem to like it and that's great..but if you're an '80/90s child looking to buy this for nostalgia, forget it. You're better off watching the classic TV game show on DailyMotion or YouTube."
5,This CD is a History lesson that you don't hear in school!,"All ten songs on this CD address the genocide that was leveled on the indigenous people of Turtle Island by a country whose president is now claiming ""American has never stood for terrorism"". Considering idiot George Bush was a history major at Yale or Harvard he should know his history much better! America was built on blood and greed and that is why we are facing so much resistence in Iraq and other Muslim nations. This Cd is almost out of print so if you care about true history buy this CD! George Bush's idea of freedom is much different that Georgie's idea of freedom! The American sheeple are clueless!"
1,The Infallible Roulette System,(...) What a load of garbage. Save your money for the gambling table and find a free copy of this rubbish on the net.
1,Defective Unit and Lousy Customer Service,"This unit did not work correctly out of the box. It would not graph a thing. The screen was blank, but would give me a digital depth reading. I called Humminbird and they sent me a new transducer. This did not work either. In the meantime my right cursor stopped working. So, in the middle of the 2 week fishing season that I look forward to all year, I sent the whole unit back to them priority mail and they got it in 36 hours. They took 2 days to work on it and then shipped it back FedEX..... I got it 8 days later (12 total days out of service). I opened up the box and tested it. They did not even touch the head. It still had all the old settings, the right cursor still did not work and there were little flecks of salt by the connector that were there when I sent it in. On top of that, they included a USED transducer with it. So, my review would be simple. This unit does not work and their service department is not capable of fixing it."
2,lemon unit,Worked great for two fishing trips then developed a large black spot about the size of a quarter on the screen. Lowrance makes a better product and has better service.
5,WORKS GREAT,"My son is a fishing fool, especially ice fishing he says his 565 is awsome, I recently ordered the ice ducer for him for a christmas present and he loves it!"
1,My second humminbird product - and my LAST!,"This product is so unreliable, it's caused me a lot of grief while fishing. I've even lost gear because of it by hanging up on the bottom! The screen would stop reading the depth and would say we're in 1 or .1 feet of water all of a sudden. Then hit the power button and it'll go back to reading the right depth. Then it goes back to reading .1', hit power on and off, then it'll work for a few minutes, etc.. aggravating! Don't bother with this one."
5,One of the Most Eduring Works Of Comedy,I saw this presentation on PBS's Great Performances over twenty two years ago. I have longed for an encore performanc and now I have it. Tom Conti is absolutely brilliant as the devil may care character. The scene at the dinner table is one of the funniest I have ever seen.
5,It's about time!,"I saw this years ago on PBS, long before DVDs. When dvds came into common use, I searched far and wide for The Norman Conquests, but only found a British edition, not playable on American players. I went to a lot of trouble finding a DVD player that would work in the US but play British region dvds, just so I could watch The Norman Conquests. It's great to see it released now in the US so more of us can enjoy it -- worth every penny.Now, if only we could get the Emma Thompson/Ian Richardson/David Troughton (who plays - wonderfully - the befuddled Tom here) The Winslow Boy on American DVD, my happiness would be complete!"
4,Nostalgia,"I last saw these plays at least 20 years ago (it seems) on British TV and it was one of the most memorable viewing experiences of my life. It has stayed with me ever since. A tour de force of writing,acting and a very original treatment of a story.Alan Ayckbourn (the playwright) is a national treasure. Try it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
4,Life is the slower lane...,"For years I have sought out this trilogy hoping to see it again after first viewing it on PBS. Finally, amazon.com provided me with the full set! What a delight.My memory didn't serve me well...it was even more interesting than I recalled. The characters are rich in development...making mundane moments in life quite memorable to the viewer.So tightly knit, the story weaves through lives (and rooms) with humor and exposes each character's frailties in a cunning fashion, yet offers an understanding of their power to cope with life.Quite delightful...I enjoyed it thoroughly."
5,Larry Goodson Had The Story Before 9/11/2001,"This book should be read by every U. S. Citizen if you want to understand the who, what, when, where and how of the world politic in Afghanistan. Reading this book will give you a complete understanding of the meaning of the word ""Blowback"".It is easy to read and understand. He sets forth all the historical facts including the facts that we do not want to hear. No matter what you may think before reading Mr. Goodson's book, after you read his book you certainly will have more to think about.Many people who thought they had the answer as to what to do about Afghanistan, have found themselves asking. . . ""What should we do about Afghanistan and the Middle East""? If you read closely he gives us a few hints!"
4,Wider knowledge of Afghanistan could result in more thoughtful media coverage,"I thought this book a somewhat dry but meticulous survey of Afghanistan. My conclusion is that every nation that tried to directly influence events there has suffered extreme consequences. A lot of Pakistan's problems have roots in its attempts to create a security buffer in that country. The Soviet Union, the U.S. and all others have found this one region to defy all attempts to create their respective ideals of a stable Afghan government.Goodson understands why outside powers fail in Afghanistan in the long run, expending resources with nothing tangible to show in the end. It is a unique, diverse and ungoverned country, with a long history of conflict and shifting loyalties. This is a place where things don't work the same way as anywhere else. Even now, it would be beneficial if more Americans read this book and force more thoughtful coverage in the media."
1,Hardly ever works for me,"I haved tried time and time again to get this heart rate monitor to work and it is very hit or miss. I ride my bike on a wind trainer and some mornings it works perfectly but most of the time it reads very inaccurately and/or just won't read at all. I try taking it off, rewetting it, being patient, etc. and it just doesn't seem to work. I am looking for a better one. I paid $49 for this one and it was definitely not worth it."
4,"For the money, a great product so far!","I have used the heart rate monitor several times now, and it works great. I tested it against the heart rate monitor on the treadmill itself, and it was within a few beats. It is perfect for what I do - casual workouts."
1,Doesn't really work but what do you expect for $12.99,"This unit keeps time well, but does not accurately measure heart rate well at all. It fluctuates constantly, in large jumps."
1,Missing parts,Received the item but no bolts. Can't install into the truck.Call them twice about it and they said they will send them but never receive it.Never buy from this place again.
5,Wonderful book,I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and an ability to be frightened by what has happened to our media coverage of the republican party.
4,Nothing new here,"There is really nothing new in this book. All it does is reinforce the thinking public's perception that the election did not end in the manner the framers of the constitution intended. However, this is repeated so often, you get the feeling the author's main theme was pasted on a sticky note in front of his word processor. An enjoyable read, and I do give it 4 stars, simply because there are those out there who still believe George the II was elected honestly."
5,BETTY CROCKER IS THE BEST !!!,"I received this beautiful book one week ago, it's wonderful, full of photos and mouth-watering recipes.I own other BC's cookbooks and this one is perfect too !!!Once again Betty Crocker is the best !!!!"
4,Mr.,good job on getting the order on time but speakers do not fit in 95 chevy S10 had to cut metal to make fit
4,Flying High,"Awesome frisbee, too bad it ended up on the roof after the 15 minutes of play time. I'd love another one."
5,Greatest frisbee ever made!,"This Aerobie Skylighter frisbee is super easy to throw. It travels farther than most frisbees. It has a softish edge so it is easy to catch. Also, it is the brightest of all the light up frisbees and looks the coolest at night. The only downside is people constantly wanting to know where you got the frisbee. As far as durability, we've had this frisbee for a couple years, hit park benches, concrete, you name it, changed batteries once, and it is still super bright and going strong and hasn't changed in physical appearance at all. It is a quality product. I've tried nearly every lighted and non-lighted frisbee style disc made, and this is the best of the best."
3,Good cleanser but not great for acne,This is a great gentle cleanser. I wanted something that would help control my occassional (monthly) acne breakout and i don't think this is a great product for that otherwise it is good.
3,Watch out for the shipping costs!!!,"They charge you $1.99 for the block and $4.50 for shipping!I ordered two, so they charged me $8.98 for shipping and it only cost them $3.35 according to the USPS label. So, they are making their money on the shipping charges. And these ""$2.00"" blocks actually cost you $6.50. It's still a decent deal, but it just seems a little sneaky."
4,Yoga blocks,"This is a basic, low cost yoga block. A good choice for somebody starting out not wanting to spend too much on a fancier block."
2,Too small,"This block is too small. I didn't realize there were different sizes, I thought all yoga blocks were the same. This one is smaller than the ones they have in the studios and it's harder to sit on."
3,Kid Game,My son (5 years old) plays with this for 45 minutes at a time. He really loves all of the Putt-Putt games. They require the child to remember where things are and figure out how to solve a mystery. I highly recommend this game.
1,emo crap band,this band can play dub and ska very well. but over all they are terrible. I'm talking terrible. but a few good numbers lol
5,Muat have for students and professional programmers alike,I used this book in school for my Intro to AS/400 and Control Language Programming courses. It is surprisingly easy to follow and understand as far as programming books go.Worst mistake I made was selling this book have completing my course work as I am now working as a AS/400 programmer and it is a really great reference manual.
2,Is not what is advertised,"I bought this battery because it is labeled as a Panasonic brand battery. When I received it, I found out it is NOT a Panasonic brand. So far, the seller seems to be taking care of it in the form of return & refund. They said they never advertised it as a Panasonic brand, that it was a mistake on Amazon's listing."
3,Well...,"I have read many V.C. Andrews books, and as many people have already discovered many of the same elements are in every single book. I would recomend this book only to someone who has not read many of the V.C. Andrews books. Cinnamon was a slightly different character, but I kept comparing her to all the others."
3,typical - but still worth reading,"unfortunately, some of the reviews try and compare this book to previous v.c. andrews books; however, v.c. andrews died several years ago and these books are all written ""in her style"" and based on storylines she left and had not developed. to expect heaven or flowers in the attic is truly a mistake. if you like the v.c. andrews' storylines of screwed up families, then the shooting stars series won't disappointment you. just don't expect what you can't have and you will be all set."
3,Sigh....,"I just have to say that I don't like the miniseries that the writers are doing! Of the three miniseries (The Orphans and the Wildflowers), this book, the first of Shooting Stars, was the most confusing. I didn't even get what the point was until the end. There was no passion like the other books that VC Andrews has written. I easily read this book in two hours, and I wasn't impressed. I don't want to give away the plot to anyone who would have a desire to read this, but it's very blasse. The girl, Cinnamon, is very much like every other character that has appeared in VC Andrews' books, yet has much less of a personality. Yet, I understand that once you are hooked to VC Andrews, you have to read every book that comes out by her. I am looking forward to the large book that wraps up the four girls' stories."
5,Cinnamon VC Andrews,I have been reading the V.C Andrews series for many years now. They keep getting better with each book. Thanks
3,ok,"I found some of this series at Goodwill and have loved others, but this series just fell flat for me"
3,The play's the thing,"Mother draws fetuses on her stomach with lipstick, father has clients with unconventional requests, and grandma likes interior decorating a little too much. Plus there are spirits lurking about. Ah, normalcy.Cinnamon likes to role-play, reality being what it is. Soon she's doing what many an unhappy person desperately in need of love does: she acts. And will live to act another day. Let's wish her good luck."
2,Bland,"I was intrigued by this new series, and wondered what it might be like. Ultimately, I was disappointed in the series, because it doesn't have the whole multigenerational family secrets/drama theme that made a VCA book. When this first book came out, i still had faith in Neiderman and was still excited when a new series was penned. Now nearly ten years later, Neiderman has gotten even worse. Amazingly, this book is decent compared to his current novels (Gemini, April Shadows, Broken Flower, Attic Secrets, Heavenstone) but the drama in this book feels more contrived, almost like a teenager wrote it with drama and weirdness in mind. There was some effort here, but ultimately this book falls flat due to the whole drama with Cinnamon's mother, the miscarriage, Grandmother Beverly, and the like. I honestly can't recommend this for anything more than a cheap and entertaining (barely) read."
2,Meh,"As much as I love V.C. Andrews, however formulaic they can be, this one was just too bland. Sure, she deviates a little bit from the usual v.c. andrews heroines by being ""goth"", but even that wore thin rather fast. It just didn't have enough dramatic suspense(c'mon the biggest twist is that the grandmother is a nasty old crone). It might have been better as a full scale book, so more attention could've been paid to character developement. The mini-series are just gettting progressively weaker."
3,A Okay Book!,"This book is not great but it's okay better then Ice that for sure. But it's nothing like the real VC Andrews books, who was very good specialy Heaven and all the Casteel serie. If you have nothing to read this book is not that bad."
3,It's no Flowers in the Attic.....,"Andrew Neiderman's work seems to be improving. Cinnamon is better than the Orphans, or the Wildflowers, but as usual, it's very typical. I knew what would happen from page 1. This book was no V.C., but hey, it's getting better. I will read this series, even though I swore after reading Eye of the Storm I wouldn't read another ghostwritten book (under VCA's GOOD name) ever again."
2,*sigh*,"I think this mutated semblance of literature needs to be crushed in the iron grip of ""out of print"" as does most of the poor dead idiotic ramblings of ""the Ghost Writer"" *cough* Andrew Neiderman.Every word that floated into my vision from that most horrible book made me want to throw up all over again.Oh and goodie-goodie! She's a goth! Yay! Diversity! *NOT* Everyone in highschool doesn't beat the different popularity over the head with a stick. It may just be my highschool, but I'm pretty much the picture people get in their heads when you say ""non-conformist"" and guess what, I have a.) never been accused of being a lesbian with my teacher b.) never had my mother go crazy for a month then come back and c.) never had a putrid evil half-mad grandmother.Andrew had better have some body-guards, old Cleo V. Andrews might roll out of her grave and make an attemp on his life if this keeps up.2 stars for the lack of romantic interest she had for her family members."
2,Ok... I guess,"I am sorry, but I was horribly dissapointed with this book, but I was also disappointed with Rain and that entire series. It just seems the V.C. Andrews books are losing there magic. I have loved every previous series (including the orphan series) before the most recent two, but somehow the plot and the character depth has become lacking. I guess it was inevitable with a company writing books for a dead author, but this book especially was repetitive to the past books and rather boring. There was nothing in it to draw you in like in her early novels... sigh, I do highly recommend reading the Dollanganger series as well as the Casteel series and many of the others (all of the other longer books and the orphan series)."
2,Cinnamon was okay,"I wasn't very happy with this book. I am an avid V.C. Andrews reader and found that this book lacked the v.c. andrews spice in all her later books. I am looking forward to the last novel that brings all the four girls together in hopes that it will make the miniseries some what entertaining. I loved the Hudson series and enjoy the novel series much more than the mini ones. The smaller books leave no room for more detail, enriching plots and the famous surprising twists that I love so much from V.C. Andrews."
2,Sun screen yuk,Greasy bothered my eyes but did protect me from burning price is reasonable but overall experience was poor. Will never buy this brand again
5,The Jack Nicholson story,Well written and excellent reading. Since I grew up in the same area as Jack and know some of the people involved it was most interesting to me and everyone else in the area as we all know the story in this book and know that this book is very true and very honest in every word.
5,Excellent!,"I have bought more than 10 Jumpstart titles already, they are all excellent. This one is no exception! My two children (6 and 8) have been ""locked"" on it for 2 straight days. For one thing, they have been having a lot of fun with it while learning some basic Spanish. It is really a good starting point (of course a starting point only), but I am wondering where to go from here once they finish it up in a few more days."
5,This one is a MUST HAVE for Every Author,"As you learn to market and promote your book, you'll find there are a many hucksters who attempt to tell you about publicity based on having promoted one small book themselves.You have to ask yourself..

4,A CLASSIC FOR ME AND THE BOYS,"If you know the band and the album title is new to you, please check if this band is the Tyrant you think. Because, there are at least three bands with the same name. One is a recent band who issued a album titled as Grimoires in 2005.""Mean Machine"" is the work of the German Heavy Metal band of the mid-eighties. Their music is somewhat close to Accept's German Metal with more brutal vocals. I can recall another good album from this band ""Fight For Your Life"" and when I checked the internet, I gathered that they have a third album called ""Running Hot"", a live album ""Live and Crazy"" and two re-releases of the first two albums ""Blind Revolution"" and ""Metal Rules"". You can check http://www.bnrmetal.com/groups/tyr2.htm for info and album covers.If you like classic metal of 80s, THIS Tyrant will give you what you need. Especially this album is a collectible for me and my friends. Rusty, geniune, heavy metal from the days we were kids and METAL RULED THE EARTH."
1,disgraceful,"This book is the worst piece of disingenous nonsense I have read for a while. His dogmatic adherence to religious dogma over actual science is a disgrace. The title suggests that he has evidence, what a misleading statement. If I could give this awful trope minus 5 stars I would. This is pure apologetic (aka liars for Jesus ) propaganda. Total rubbish."
1,Discerning readers should avoid,"I was given this book by a Christian family member with the message that it was eye opening in it's presentation of new discoveries.Unfortunately it is (in my opinion) full of unsubstantiated conclusions and misrepresentations of non-creationist view points. The central argument seems to be that if something cannot be explained then it proves that it is the work of a creator. Setting aside advances in knowledge that might see the currently not explained become explained, we only need to glance back in history to know that many thing ascribed to the creator are now well understood. His arguments simply put do not even come close to justifying his conclusion.This book seems to be written for the simpleton, avid creationist, or both.It rates one star for its interesting anecdotes on complexity found in nature. Many of which I have not heard of before - but am prepared to take on face value."
3,Doesn't even cover a timing belt change,"I bought this manual with a first project in mind: changing the timing belt. The only coverage of that operation is in the context of tearing down the whole front end of the engine. I have no idea how much stuff I really have to remove if all I want to do is change the timing belt. I mean, any somewhat experienced back yard mechanic can figure out how to change the air filter or an upper radiator hose, thank you, but where a manual really proves its worth is on an operation like ... a timing belt change.I can't comment on any other content because I haven't gotten there yet, but it's very disappointing to see such poor coverage of such an essential topic."
4,proof that i have a soul.,"one of the few written works that have solicited tears, even days after finishing the novel. i speak for myself when i say this: norwegian wood was depressing as hell, but it was the greatest and most eloquently expressed account of young love that i've ever come across."
5,My First Murakami Book,"It was kind of autobiographic, I guess. The characters are so lonesome, weird, emotional cripples and so needy.Is not the story that it's so great about this book, is the way he is guiding the reader through an awkward journey of emotions and feelings.You will not have a way out and you'll feel absolutely close to all of the characters"
4,A well written book,A very unique writing style. At points during this book you need to reflect on what you have just read. Very good.
3,It's strange ...,"... that if you purchase this book from the U.S. Amazon site, it's 298 pages long. If you purchase this from the U.K. Amazon.co.uk site, you will be buying a book that is 400 pages long. Both these versions have the same physical dimensions. Are we getting the whole novel or an abridgement?"
1,Extremely tedious,"I can't believe that this is supposed to be one of Murakami's best works. It is extraordinarily dull, even for him. The usual (perhaps ""original"", since it's an early work) self-absorbed Holden Caulfield-esque protaganist, the usual self-conscious references to Western literature and music (is this why Murakami was so popular in Japan, because he refers to painfully often to the ""exotic"" West?), the usual UN-selfconsciously misogynistic perspectives of human relationships. I suggest you try Wind Up Bird Chronicle, then give up on this author altogether."
3,A little tiresome,"This book is beautifully written, but got tiresome after a while. The narrator seems to have very weird choices in friends and is kind of a downer. If I heard one more description of how often he masturbated, I was gonna scream! I did find the description of 60s teenage culture very interesting--sounds like America!"
1,Drug free sleep aid.,"Based on the high reviews of the book and the author, I got this book, Norwegian Wood, to read while travelling in Europe. Without fail, and regardless of whether I was tired or rested, this book put me to sleep.At the price of US$5.99, it is cheaper by far than a prescription sleep aid and cheaper than over the counter sleep aids with no known side effects.I guess I'll keep it as a cheap sleep inducer to replace textbooks and technical manuals. It's a lot smaller and lighter."
1,An Utter Waste Of Time,"I've read three of Murakami's books, and quite frankly, I don't understand his appeal to so many people.In this book Watanabe is a listless, dull, young man. To give you a taste for his depth, witness the following excerpt of a conversation he had with a friend who, according to Watanabe, had a profound insight into Mozart's music: ""...with Itoh's smart and heartfelt commentary ('There - that part., ""How about that?')...."" Other conversations throughout the book are equally stimulating.I struggled to get through this book filled with suicide and depression, without any insights."
5,Powerful,"This book haunts me well after I have finished it. The charecters were so well developed to the point were I began to feel very strong emotions as the individuals in the book incurred victories and defeats. One of Murakami's best, as well as most contraversial. Despite the contraversy, this novel still bares his unique style, and I highly reccomend Norwegian Wood to anyone who can read."
4,brilliant and authentic,"Norwegian Wood is my the first book by Murakami that I've read, and without a doubt it will not be the last. To be honest, I was a little skeptical after reading the first chapter, and almost let it go after this point, but a few days later I picked up Norwegian Wood again, and am very glad that I did. Murakami's exploration of human psychology and sexuality is brilliant and authentic, and although I have no way of comparing Norwegian Wood to his other works, I find it unfortunate that some are contending that this novel is ""too conventional"" and not up to par with his other works. Norwegian Wood is an excllent book in its own right."
4,another Haruki love story,"Love the charecters, in fact i identify with the feelings and the beautiful realationship. However, the book is so full of suicide - makes me sad, but i realize that's what live if like - a beautiful book - one of his best"
4,Love story,"Murakami is amazing. He writes with such ease you just read everything quickly. The love story in this book is not a typical one. Its sad but beautiful at the same time. I recommend it for people who know Murakami's style, they will not be disappointed."
4,"Sexy, funny, romantic","The book is great the movie, terrrrrible. Racier than I expected. A bit episodic, still wonder why Toru falls in love with Midori so much though."
4,"Not typical Murakami, but a good read nonetheless","_Norwegian Wood_ is not ""typical"" Murakami--no weird sub-plots, mysterious aniamls etc. It is nonetheless a good example of the bildungsroman genre and an interesting portrayal of student life in Japan in 1968-1970, not all that different it turns out, from student life anywhere at that time period. The segment set at the sanatorium, while important to the plot, goes on a bit too long. The Tokyo-based scenes with Toru and Midori being more interesting and better developed. The ending, somewhat eliptical, is more typical of Murakami's work as are the many western cultural references, descriptions of food and its preparation and the sexual adventures of the main character. An interesting read."
4,After reading a dozen or so of his other books...,"I found this book quite disturbing in places, but it had the stamp of Murakami's unique, enthralling style, and was a delight to read."
4,A College Classic,"I was very impressed with Norwegian Wood. Murakami brings to life Toru Watanabe in such a way that I, as a reader, felt I could reach into the pages and touch him. He's flawed. Man is he flawed. An introvert to the very core, Toru spends a lot of time reading the Great American Novels while everyone else is reading Japanese Bestsellers. He goes about his business without a care that the people he associates with are only there because of proximity and not any real meaning. Toru may be flawed, but the few people he comes to care about make him seem perfectly normal. Naoko is quiet and aloof, Reiko is to used to her protected life, Nagasawa is a perfect ass and Midori is a little to extroverted for the people she loves.All at once a Coming of Age story, a story of first loves and eternal losses Norwegian Wood is a perfect story for all ages, beautifully translated (at least in my edition) and will stay with you for weeks after you put it down for the last time"
5,"Emotionally intense tale of life, love and death","Out of all Murakami's books I've read this one is my favourite; Murakami is a master at mixing extremes to create something new and bigger than the compromise that we have come to accept; he often deals with life & death, dreams & reality, passion & routine and reject the notion that they are opposites; in this book, while dealing with those he also reject the notion that hope and despair are opposites; he shows them mixed, one leading to the other and vice-versa."
5,The book that will make you read too late into the night,"Norwegian Wood is as lucid and vivid as a book could ever be. Taking you to an unbelievable journey of growing up, love, lost love, new love, understanding life, and dealing with loss of the loved ones. Murakami started the book with a hint of mystery, continued the story with a realistic portrayal of a young man with his young, heroic love, along with a lot of humors that are actually very funny, then finished the book with a lingering feeling of mystery. This is the book, that will stay forever and will always be an amazing read, no matter what generation you are."
4,The saddest book I've ever read...,"Great ending. This sure was the saddest book I've ever read. Seems very dark and depressing, but the light comes out at the very end and you can see the sunshine through the clouds. I've never read a book like this and to be honest, I'm not sure I ever want to read another one. It just takes a piece of you and leaves you feeling a little empty. I don't even know how to explain it. It's like traveling up a mountainside on a dark gray day. Yes, the beauty is still there, but you have to look for it. You don't even notice the beauty before you because of the overcast skies. The higher up you go, the more drained you feel. At the very end, as you reach the top, you're bone weary and exhausted, both mentally and physically, but suddenly you can see above the clouds and it's so bright that your eyes hurt and the whole mountain suddenly looks different...you suddenly feel renewed...the world you thought was gloomy and gray is suddenly bright and new....and beautiful....."
2,I wasn't a huge fan of this novel,"I wasn't a huge fan of this novel. I found it to be slow and boring. It's probably boring because not a lot happens to the main character. He's a loner who is tormented about being in love with someone who doesn't love him. The only other thing he does is meet psychotic people and sleep with complete strangers. I know that sounds like a good plot but it's not. I didn't develop any interest in the book until half way through and then I was just let down by the ending. When I read the ending I threw the book. No Lie. It was so disappointing, it didn't answer any questions and left me confused.I know it probably sounds like I hated the book but that's not totally true. Even though I found most of the book to be boring it had its moments. I think what kept me from hating it completely was the writing style and the characters, who all have interesting pasts.I would like to warn any readers that are horrified by smutty content that there are a lot of sex scenes."
5,"Fabulous, Dark, Mundane, and Extraordinary!","As one who lived in Japan for ten years, I can't remember how I came across this book, nor can I pinpoint exactly what makes this book so outstanding. Perhaps ""haunting"" would be a fitting adjective. Once finished, the reader is left with a feeling of melancholy, and caught up in the main character of the story. As always, Mr. Murakami's characters are extremely believable, fascinating, and reaffirms the fact that regardless of nation or culture, people are basically the same, the world over, and all wrestle with the same set of existential dilemmas"
3,enjoyable but awkward,"Maybe it's the translation that was weak but having read Sputnik Sweetheart, Norwegian Wood seems immature. I've read that this book was written early in Murakami's career but published after his other works and he himself did not want this book widely distributed outside of Japan so maybe he felt the same way.Some of the dialogue felt so set up and sometimes downright silly. You could almost hear the author thinking, ""now here is where I make him seem really deep"" or ""this will make her seem tragic.""On the other hand, I really enjoyed the descriptions of dorm life and everyday activities. When the main charcater was alone, it all flowed nicely. Whenever dialogue was involved, it often seemed contrived.I hope I don't offend anyone with this mediocre rating especially amongst all the 5 star ratings. I do like Murakami's writing though and am looking forward to his Wind up Bird Chronicle."
4,Murakami Revisited,"Toru is a student who cannot come to grips with his life. He loves Naoko, who is even more unbalanced than Toru. Naoko winds up in some obscure institution. Toru is ready to fall apart, but is rescued at the last moment by a real-life woman.No doubt the story is written beautifully and, standing on its own, should be recommended. But: If you ever read any of Mr. Murakami's other books, then you know the contents of this book without reading it. After a while, it gets to be monotonous."
3,Trans-Siberian Orchestra: The Lost Christmas Eve,"While the shipping was prompt, I was very dissapointed when I put the cd in my car and home cd players and it wouldn't play. I had to load the cd onto my computer and burn a new cd in order to listen to it. While I don't feel that I should ever have to go to such lengths to listen to a brand new disc, I would have definately returned the disc had I not had the capabilities to load it onto my computer and make a new one. I now have a cd sitting around that will never play without being copied. That being said, I will most likely not buy another cd from anyone on Amazon.com in the future."
4,Received item on time,"I received this item on time,and it was as ordered. I didn't have any problems with my order at all."
4,"Close to Five Stars, But Not Quite","I would say most people either like TSO, or they don't. I'm not a big fan of some of their stuff that includes vocals, but their instrumental arrnagements are great. If you like Classical, Christmas, and driving guitars, you'll love this.........and if you like this, and you haven't seen TSO in concert, getting to a concert is a must. It's a fabulous three hour show that puts a lot of their music into perspective......but you'd better be ready for loud and lots of lights and pyrotechnics. It's an experience."
5,MUST HAVE at Christmas,"I absolutely love everything about this Christmas album. It still has a taste of the traditional Christmas songs that we all know and love, yet it's intermingled with a totally awesome set of sounds that only the Trans-Siberian Orchestra can create. Oh, and one can't beat $5.00 for the entire mp3 album download!"
3,Alright....,"It was a great deal for the amount of songs that you get, but all of the songs sound the same. Would not recommend unless you like a lot of guitar."
3,Some of the songs are great!,"While definitely not my favorite album they've put it out, it does have some great tracks. Since I put it all in a playlist anyway, I simply omitted the tracks I wasn't so thrilled with. Which tracks you ask? Well, I'm not always thrilled with the vocals, so many of those tracks went away, but that's just personal taste not their fault."
5,Simply put...AWESOME !,I purchased this CD for a Christmas gift and then chose to keep it myself. After ONE listen...I am hooked! The BEST Christmas CD EVER! I am a fan! Now I will purchase other CD's by the Trans Siberian Orchestra! The Lost Christmas Eve is AWESOME!
3,Some good songs,"There are a few good songs that we played through the house over the Holidays, but a few were a little too overpowering for background music. I like Rock, but not so much to set the Christmas mood."
5,The Lost Christmas Eve,"I love this CD and I have listened to it extensively. There are very different types of music, eg classical, rock, etc and I think it would suit a lot of people's tastes."
5,Listen at least 5 times first,"I'll try to keep this short. If you like TSO's other works you will like this album. Like its predecessors, you have to take the time to listen to this disc several times before coming to a conclusion about whether you like it or not. I would also recommend that you take the time to read all the liner notes, stories and lyrics while you listen to it. None of the TSO library (or that of Savatage) is light background music. In order to appreciate this music, you have to pay attention and follow along.I think this disc falls slightly short of the previous two in the trilogy. I'd give a 4.5 if I could. But this is the best headbanger christmas music you will ever find. Enjoy!"
4,New Music,"This ""new"" music is absolutely riveting. The orchestra is very innovative and the music very diversified. You don't hear the same thing song to song. Their song WIZARDS OF WINTER (made popular by the fantastic light show on a house decorated for Christmas) is great. One of those ""I can't get it out or my head songs""! Hope they continue to keep up the good work."
5,Not Just a Christmas CD,"We are still listening to this CD, long after Christmas, because it's so incredibly beautiful to listen to. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes really GOOD music!"
3,"so, so","Bought this CD for the ""Wizards of Winter"" song ... the rest is not my taste and very differnt from WoW ..."
3,Good instrumentals,"The instrumentals on this album are very good. Unfortunately, the vocal selections are almost all Broadway-esque and I really don't care for them at all. Take a lesson from prog rock operas - the rock voice goes much better with the hard guitar orchestration."
2,They are OUT of ideas. Save your money.,"I love(d) TSO, I love Savatage, & I was VERY excited to hear this. Bottom line, other than a couple of the instrumentals, this is a weak, repetitive, formulaic droner. NOT worth your time, there is nothing here that wasn't done better on the last 2 Christmas albums. I regret the purchase, but I still love thier other stuff. Also, that blues singer STINKS. His songs were the only low points on the last two albums, and it seems like you can't get away from him on this one."
1,"Funny, But Not in a Good Way",At first I thought it was a satirical recording making fun of overly dramatic holiday music. Then I realized it was meant to be serious. Sad.
3,This Christmas Eve was Found - on the last two albumns,"Love them or hate them, the TSO is back with another CD of ""Holiday"" music that is basically unrecognizable from their two prior CDs of ""Holiday"" music. If you liked what you heard before and want their relatively uniform treatment of another 70+ minutes of Holiday music, then this CD is for you. To me, however, it just sounded self-derivative - like they felt that they needed to release another albumn but without any new ideas. Often compared to Manheim Steamroller (unfairly I believe; MS is WAY beyond TSO in musical ability) which also definately has a recognizable ""sound"", Lost Christmas has no new ideas or sparks, just ""more of the same"". Chip Davis' Fresh Aire albumns always have at least something unique to them. I doubt that I will purchase any future TSO albumns; 31/2 hours of them is MORE than enough for me!"
2,Boring..............,"Let me first say that I am a huge fan of both Savatage and TSO. However, this album is more of the same. Some songs are done very nicely, while others have a kind of broadway type feel. This is the only TSO album where I have to skip several tracks because they are so bad. If you are a first time TSO, get the first album Christmas Eve and Other Stories. I agree with the other reviewers in that a lot of the same songs are found in watered down renditions on this album. Good attempt, but the first two are much better."
2,Not enough Christmas Spirit,"Though I am an avid Trans-Siberian Orchestra lover, I felt that this CD was lacking in the emotional connection that their other two Christmas albums have. It seems almost like the CD was pushed, that they cared less about the music and more about making profit off of their followers."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I have not paid that much attention to TSO, so was a bit disappointing with the overall album. The instrumentals are stunning, but the vocals are a bit droll for my taste. Bits and pieces of the album make the whole worth the price, but I did have to do a lot of dissecting to end up with a playlist I enjoy."
2,The Lost Christmas Eve,"The Lost Christmas by Trans-Siberian Orchestra. The CD was purchased just for the track, ""Christmas Canon"" which I find a great song/melody, but I did not care for the remaining tracks on the CD."
4,TSO Great,This is one of the great sounds at Christmas with Music. TSO is great. It spices up the Holiday. Wonderful download from Amazon.
5,Exceptional.,The music is wonderful. The story line included in the liner notes made my wife cry. It's that good!
1,I feel like I'm taking crazy pills,"Because everyone else here calls this a rocking christmas band?!?!? What the hell are these guys doing that rock so hard, they play 3 power cords and everyone thinks they are the greatest Christmas band since sliced bread. I think it is a great idea, but I think the artists in the band are minimally talented, but I understand the point of this band is to make kids think that church and Jesus is cool so lets make Christmas a rock show, because rock shows are cool."
1,How could they,How in gods name could they make this album! The first one was and is a work of Art.Great music.But this new one is Crap im sorry to put it this way but its the only thing that comes to mind when i play it.Her is a Great Reason for Piracy had i had the opportinity to play this cd i would have never ever paid a dime for it.Most depressing from a group that has produced outstanding musicin the past
1,Insufferable dreck!,"OK, I confess this was my first--and last--TSO album. I was excepting something sort of like Mannheim Steamroller (so, admittedly, I wasn't in the most receptive frame of mind, although I like some of MS's Christmas albums). What I got was a cross between King Crimson and bad Kiss. Admittedly I turned it off after 6 songs, finding that ""Car Talk"" was superior. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I suppose if you like this kind of thing, then this is the kind of thing you'll like. But I wasted $10 on it, frankly."
3,Inconsistent Effort,"I really enjoyed moments of this CD, which brought great rock sounds to some traditional Christmas music. There are some other good moments with choral voices. However, I hesitate to play the CD, because I don't want to sit throught some painfully monotonous and predictable songs, and some with horrible voice parts (who told that guy he could sing???)to get to the few good ones.Still, there are 23 songs on the CD, so you may feel there are enough of merit to make it a worthwhile purchase. I would estimate one-third of the songs are good, and when they are good they are quite good. There is less orchestra than I thought there would be, not being familiar with the band previously. Don't be fooled by the name, this is not classical music! It's Christmas for rockers."
2,Euro-Metal Meets Christmas?,This CD reeks of Euro-Metal of the worst kind! I give it two stars because there are some decent musicians who play the music. It's just that this music was done and done and done throughout the 80s. I agree with the other reviewers who have said they couldn't believe this music was for real. It is so over the top as to come across as a caricature of bad 80s metal.
2,"some good, some not so much",I loved Wizards in Winter and was expecting to love the whole album but not so much. I have a couple of favorites but wish I had just downloaded those and not bought the album.
5,Amplifies the Love of the Son,"If you want your Christmas to be touched by the love of the Lord, read the story of 'The Lost Christmas Eve' before you listen to the music. It's a very deep and moving story laced with heartache and tragedy that ends with the 'Love of Jesus' revealed in the end. Then sit back and enjoy listening to this classical story amplified by the music."
3,Good rock music and a story to go with it,"As a ""Mannheim Steamroller"" fan, I like the T-SO selections for variety. I'd prefer straight music and less ""narrative"", but I know T-SO has a loyal following too."
5,TSO magic,Have this cd and wanted it for my kindle fire. Love all the Trans-siberian Orchestra's music and needed somefor my kindle.
5,My New Christmas Music,"During the holidays I love to listen to Christmas music and I do it every day I can. So when I heard a song from this album on our local radio station, I had to find it. I did, on YouTube (Yea YT!), and bought it immediately. The song was Pachelbel's Canon in D and their rendition of it is SWEET!!! I love the voices on this album, the fire in the belly, the passion in their portrayal of spiritual music. If you like Mannhiem Steamroller Christmas music, you will probably like this one too."
5,wonderful music,These people [The Trans Siberian Orchestra] are supurb musicians. They are capable of taking anypiece of music andtheir own personal touch.
3,Lost Christmas,"I recently ordered the CD of Tran-Siberian Orchestra's ""Lost Christmas"", because I was so impressed with #23 on their song list. It is traditional Christmas music with an electric guitar rock balad twist. It is not hard rock, or ear-splitting. It is original and somewhat ethereal. However, the rest of the CD is a little ""out there"", and I grew tired of the sound over-all. If you are looking for an original sound that envelopes you, you will like this, however, expect much of the same from the CD as a whole."
3,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY...,"I like the mills. OK. But the picture on Amazon and the description are deceptively misleading. These mills are all of 3"" to 3 1/2"" tall. That's right!!! $35 for mills about 3"" tall. That, my friends, is very expensive.I thought I was getting mills that would be about 6"" or so top to bottom, but such is one of the problems of buying online with a poor description.These get 5 stars for a small set, but 3 stars because of the very misleading listing by Amazon."
5,Nice grinders,"These are great grinders. I have purchased grinders before that were not of sufficient quality, I was very happy to see that these are excellent quality."
2,Much better one's out there,"These things are kind of junky. The salt grind on fine comes out way too quickly. The dispersal of the pepper or salt is too narrow and doesn't spread well over the target. I have a set of Olde Thompson mills which serve as my reference, these little things just don't measure up."
1,GUESSING GAME,"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN A SHAKER WITHOUT TESTING IT FIRST. THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL WHICH IS THE ""SALT"" SHAKER AND WHICH ONE IS FOR ""PEPPER. THEY ARE ATTRACTIVE SITTING ON THE COUNTER OR TABLE."
5,The closest to perfection we can expect in this world!,"This book is a fantastic tool for anyone who wishes to begin deeper reflection on their own life and their place in the world. It is packed with ideas and suggestions for living a richer, more fulfilling inner life. Its brief length and easy-reading style means that you can begin the practice of self-examination sooner rather than later."
1,Terrible.,"Waste of money. It worked decent for about 2 months. It's ridiculous now.I might not be the most technologically advanced, but I know how to take my own temperature and follow instructions. Wayyy too inaccurate for the price. I'd rather have an accurate reading of my child's tempertaure even if it means less convienance."
1,Not reliable,I don't understand this thing. It gives me drastically different readings in the same ear several times in a row as well as my baby. One minute it shows I have a fever of 100 degrees then in the same ear a moment later I'm 97.6 degrees. I don't trust this to read my baby's temperature. VERY disappointed after what I spent on it.
3,"Some interesting info, some prejudice","I don't know. Mormons and Christian Scientists often ""counsel"" their followers to adhere to certain directives. I know that from personal experience. Witnesses order their congregation to follow explicit rules about their personal lives or be shunned and dammed. To me, the word ""cult"" in modern usage, refers to mind-control that discourages people from thinking for themselves, and that greatly hinders personal freedoms, opportunities and mental health. All religions COULD do this, IF the clergy were obsessed with enforcing every ""rule"" vigorously and unforgivingly. But many modern religions just don't do that. Therefore, people should question for themselves the ones that do. Reading this book as well as books with opposing view points is the open-minded thing to do."
1,Hoekema has since admitted his mistake,"Since the publication of this book, Anthony A Hoekema has since recinded his comments about one or more of the denominations mentioned."
1,hmmmm,"Appereantly this author is needs to learn the definition of a cult. The majority of cults involves heavy use of drugs, death, and they have their ceremonies in remote areas.A little background about the SDA church. Our world headquarters is in the Washington D.C. area. Second since we are close to our national headquarters the federal govt knows us very well so obviously if we do anything that hurt people then our denomination will cease to exist. Sorry to say to those who are accusing of us being a cult but we have a SDA Chaplin at the US Capital. Also we have been around since the civil war. SDA's is like any other denomination like Methodist, Baptist, Catholics, and etc.So what the deuce?"
1,Religious Pornography,"This book nothing more than religious pornography. It's a pejorative and reactionary attack on four non-traditional Christian religions. Many of the assertions regarding the four sects are laughably wrong or horribly outdated (such as claiming that many Mormons secretly practice polygamy and refuse to baptize blacks, or the baseless attacks on the morals of Mary Baker Eddy). C.S. Lewis wrote that a religious belief that cannot withstand challenge is a religious belief not worth having. The defensive and provincial mid-century attitudes of this author, however, appear to be primarily motivated by a desire to stop readers from thinking about some of the most dynamic variations of Christianity."
2,VB Scripting - say goodbye to cross browser compatability!,"A fine book for Intranet development - a seriously flawed effort for Internet work. All material is covered using VB script, which is utterly worthless if your trying to develop a site that works with both Navigator and MSIE. Though you can complete every task discussed in this book with either VB or JavaScript, the authors summarily dismiss JavaScript. Don't purchase this book if you plan to develop sites that work across the browser divide!"
4,Decent IE4 book,"The reader from Raleigh, NC obviously didn't read the title of the book before purchasing. This is an ""IE4"" book, not a Netscape, or any other third-rate browser book. If you want cross-browser support, than DON'T buy a book that is named ""IE4 Programming"".I though that this book gave decent coverage and was worth the $."
4,They work Great now that they replaced my original set,"The original set were very difficult to use, the weights stuck together and I had to pry them apart. I discovered that one of the weights was completely bent which was why that one was SOOOO hard to use. I called Sport Block and they sent me new weights and paid to have the old ones returned to them. They made the return hassle-free which I really appreciate and the new weights work PERFECTLY, the weights don't stick together at all. I do wish I hadn't had to go through the hassle of having them be so frustrating to use (before I had them replaced.) I am very surprised there is not a better quality control system in place with the company, but at least they made it right and I am very happy with the weights now."
4,Good compromise,"I've had these for a while now, and for the most part, I like them. They are a reasonable compromise between individual weight dumbbells and other, more expensive, adjustable weights. It's easy to select the desired weight and with a maximum of 24 pounds per dumbell, you can get a good amount of resistance for most common dumbbell exercise. The minor complaints I have are that they could have a bit more room between the rods that connect the weight discs, as my knuckles can sometime rub against them unless I hold it in just a certain way, and also it's not always easy to get the weight selector ""thingie"" in the right place. Other than that, a far less expensive option than Bowflex."
3,too complicated,"The concept of these dumbbells is a good one, but they are very hard to use and so they sit and gather dust. I ended up buying different dumbbells."
3,pay the extra and get the bowflex,These are cheap for the price 180 or pay 350 for bowflex dont hesitate get the bowflex and dont look back...These look like they select from the top however they have a cheap cheap plastic slide in with a prong like system...They are frustrating to get the correct weight on both...I also have the bowflex and wish I could return these and buy the bowflex however they are for my wife so it is what it is...Once locked in they are locked in they are fine...wouldnt recommend and wouldnt buy again.
1,Flimsy,"I bought the set, because my trainer has the elite set, which I liked. I received the set damaged - plastic was broken and plates were off on one of the blocks. Fortunately, Amazon took the set back; however, I did try the block that was not damaged, and it did not feel as sturdy as the elite set. I was surprised especially with all its great reviews. I ended up reordering the 45 lbs set instead."
5,Far better than I imagined,"I bought the U-90 set and was surprised at the quality of them. I've worked out with Powerblocks here and there over the years and was familiar with various sets, including the SportBlock. But their utility is more than I thought it would be. If you buy a stand, get the rack stand, not the column stand. These dumbbells are surprisingly heavy; Powerblock does not give a single ounce, so when they read 50-lbs., you're getting all fifty!"
4,PowerBlock SportBlock Adjustable Dumbbell Set,I really like the SportsBlock dumbbells. They are easy to switch from 3 - 24 lbs. I really like that they take up so little storage room. I have been using them with the Jorge Cruze 12 second workout DVD and they work great.
3,Not expandable.,"I've noticed a few people mention that these can be expanded at a later date if needed, but the Sportsblock 2.4 is probably the only Powerblock set that cannot be upgraded with extra weights.If you're like me and are using this for a training program like P90x, go with a bigger set that goes up to 50lbs instead of trying to save yourself some cash upfront. Re-selling these and buying a heavier set isn't cheaper in the long run.I've also had the same problem with the pin slipping out during use, particularly with the lighter weights. It's a little concerning and I tend to find myself worrying about whether the pin is going to slip out rather than concentrating on the exercise.My suggestion would be to go with a heavier set (or double check with the manufacturer that whatever you get can be expanded) and to make sure it has a secure fastening system. It might take you a little longer to change the weight, but you'll be thankful in the long run."
4,Best deal for adaptable set of dumbbells,"I got these about two weeks ago and they arrived in perfect condition. The weight selector isn't exactly what I thought it would be (its just a piece of plastic held in place by an elastic band) but they work. It doesn't feel cheap, and they look nice. I cant complain really these are the best weights you can get for $200 or so. The actual weight is enough that with some repetitions you can get definition in your arms and shoulders (at least for me, 25 year old, slightly smaller 150lb dude.I would recommend these as the best value for the money."
2,"Like Harris, don't like this book.",Marjorie Harris is a wonderful writer of all things gardening. This just isn't one of her better books.
5,A terrific review for the ABSITE,"I read this book and my in-training exam score went up by over sixty points. It's not exactly a quick read at over 500 pages, but it's very readable and it contains all the information covered in the ABSITE exam. I highly recommend it as a review book for surgery residents looking to improve their scores."
5,Outstanding review book for the junior ABSITE,Any general surgery resident must spent a significant amount of time reading and preparing for the ABSITE and in order to improve their knowledge base. I have read a lot of surgical texts and find this book to have reached an excellent balance between brevity and yet thoroughly covering important basic science and clinical concepts for the junior surgical resident.
2,Grrrrrr,The mouth piece does not detach to allow for a BVM to be attached for assisted ventilation and supplemental oxygen. The seal between the soft face cushion and the harder plastic of the upper mask peals off easily.But the product does look nice in this picture doesn't it?
3,a good flash intro,"this book is good for someone new to flash, it covers everything to a certain level, i was expecting something a bit more in depth especially for a bible book, they do need to add about 600 more pages to this to bring it up to bible par, dont dismiss it though, if your new this book is perfect for you, i made the mistake of playing with flash alot before i bought this book, im gonna order flash magic, i think that one is more for the experienced users"
2,A good reference that was rushed,"My main problem is the rushed quality. Case in point, look at the opening page of Chpt 8. It list Masking after Guide Layers. Guess what? It's not there. Other sections refer to this as well in Chpt 8 but it's missing. No section on Masking at all, anywhere in the book. Plus a no-frills CD-Rom and an unimpressive color page insert section. Could have been better."
1,Gives the word Bible a bad name,"How did this book get passed anyone? Let alone the editors; let alone IDG?A bible serries book usually has more info than most books. But this book is just a collection of bits and parts -- without going into depth in any area. While there are some cool lessons on the CD, the rest of it appears to be thrown together at the last minute.I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one. I hope no one else does."
2,Weak. Avoid this one.,"Unless you're looking for another reference to sit there and get dusty along with your flash 4 user's guide, don't waste your money.This guide's top down approach lacks any depth or educational value. Its basically a rehashing of a reference guide here. You'll find little to no tutorial value if you're looking to learn.Stick with web based education until a real ""bible"" comes out."
3,Solid . . .not Flashy!,I'm new not only to the Flash-world but to animation and looking for good sources to get started. F4Bible is definitely informative but not exactly lite reading. The structure of the information is blocky and doesn't flow from area to area. I can't say that I found enlightment on the basics of animation. It is however a very good reference for those who have gotten past the preliminaries.
4,It's the Bible.,"As a novice Flash user, this has been the perfect companion to the manual for me. The authors set out to make the book relevant to the widest audience, and with numerous tutorial examples and a whole chapter on ""other web sources"", I think they've succeeded. I've purchased a couple of other Flash books while I'm learning, but this is by far the most understandable, and in my opinion the most comprehensive. A hearty Thanks to the authors for this worthwhile undertaking!"
4,Review the basics,"I would have to agree that the core of this book is devoted primarily to the basics of Flash. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing; there are points here and there, concerning the toolbars and menus and whatnot, that are well worth refreshing your knowledge of. It certainly doesn't hurt to have a comprehensive volume dedicated to what most would consider the 'mundane' basics, and the last third of the book does progress.I have this one, Flash 4 Magic, and Flash Web Design, and feel that there is enough information contained within the three to keep my brain working and learning for a long time to come."
1,Save your money ...,"I waited several weeks to get this book and it was basicallytheflash manual with additional chapter on how to use flash with programswhich I did not own. After the lack luster color pages, there are about 1 or 2 good chapters. This Book does not really do any justice for the full use and creativity FLASH 4 can bring out of someone ... There are many tutorials and good information if you try to search for them on the web."
3,Better than the training manuals,"Macromedia is not known for having great training material. In fact, the Flash online subculture provides better insight than the program manuals.With this in mind the Flash 4 Bible does a good job at teaching you the basics of Flash. This book falls flat when it comes to ActionScripts (but so do most Flash books).You will not become an expert in Flash from this book. To do that you will need Hillman Curtis' ""Flash Web Design"" (the best Flash book I have ever seen).For the new Flash user, or someone who enjoys the format of these series of books, Flash 4 Bible is a good reference tool."
1,"Poor excuse for a ""Bible"" publication","I have come to expect a certain level of professionalism from the 'Bible' series from IDG Books. However, this latest attempt falls far short, and I will more carefully consider my purchases from here forward. I received the book a few days ago, and have determined that it was written in no more than three weeks. The majority of content is straight from the Flash Users Guide - most of it covering interface and tool descriptions. There is little in the way of in-depth discussions that relate to real-world applications or the finer points of architecture and workflow that should be considered when undertaking a serious project with Flash. I wouldn't recommend this purchase to anybody who already has the Flash users manual and an internet connection - more can be learned online in two hours than by reading this entire book."
3,Do not look for examples or tutorials,"This book is great for a reference. However, if you are looking for tutorials with real examples and step by step help some books you may want to look at are Flash 4 Magic or Flash 4 - Creative Web Animation. These books offer more in the way of real examples and inspiration."
4,NW Houston reader,"An excellent book for new Flash users. I went through the Flash manual (quickly) and the built-in lessons and tutorials. This book fills in the blanks that the lessons/tutorials skipped over. In under a 1/2 hour I used this book to figure out how to build my first (but not best) movie.To make it better, the number of color examples could be increased and put them with the respective chapter that they are referencing.I'm having fun playing with the trial tools that come on the CD now. The writers have done a great job and the writing is good and easy to read."
2,A bit weak...,"Figuring that a ""Bible"" book should be good, thoroughand informational... well... it doesn't live up to yourexpectations.I felt this book was VERY VERY BASIC for 2/3 of the book. A lot of it was a waste for the money.I got more information (doing online tutorials) than with this book. The tutotials got me doing stuff immediately... compared to this book... it would have taken me... a number of chapters before I would have done anything useful.The last 1/3 of the book is a little more useful in regards to the scripting language.I would not recommend this book. I could only recommend chapters."
2,Underwhelmed and Underimpressed,"On the positive side, this is a well-written and well-edited book.On the negative side, this book does not contain any info you cannot find for free on the Web. Free Web tutorials as well as the Flash 4 User Manual will give you 90% of the info in this book.I thought the CD-ROM would contain cool examples and templates, but to my dismay the examples on the CD-ROM were very, very unimpressive. For such a powerful program and for such impressive sites that can be created with the program, the book does not even do justice to the program.I recommend the Macromedia-sponsored Flash 4 training courses. The course materials are better than this book. They actually show you how do create movies and scenes that work together.Also, forget about San Jose State University's Flash 4 classes. They stink!Looking for version 2.0 of the Bible to be much better in terms of content!"
3,"Good basics, lacking in good overal website project example","I am a novice user. I would have apreciated this book much more if it contained an overall website project from concept to finish. It does contain very useful information for a beginner, and that's about it."
1,F1 - Top left hand corner of the keyboard,"Its out of date. Its hard to develop a book based on software technologies, such as Flash. These Authors may be experienced in other applications but Flash does not seem to be their strongest area of expertise. Thanks for Releasing a printed version of the Flash technotes guys . F1 for help isnt they hard to find."
2,Poorly written,"Unfortunately the writers of this book have very low skills in explaining ideas. Also the projects in their tutorials are way to child like, e.g., "" Qwen's eyes shut when she yawns"" as an expert tutorial, very silly. I hoped for a much more sophisticated Flash Bible. This and how poorly written the Dreamweaver Bible is my once rock solid faith in IDG books is starting to crumble. Who's choosing these authors and why?"
3,Best Used For Reference,"This book provides an overview of using Flash, not a tutorial. While the book does cover a great many topics, it does not provide much in the way of meaningful step-by-step examples. Therefore, the book resides more in the reference camp--one you should keep by your desk when you hit those ""forgetful"" moments with Flash.One element that does work in this book's favor is the lack of many good treatments on this topic. So, if you were looking to learn Flash I would buy this book in addition to one focused on step-by-step examples, like Flash 4 Magic."
4,Stupid CD case,The book was good but the CD case is made terribly and takes forever to open. Also it is hard to read without taking the CD out (gives it more flexibility)I also was dissapointed when I found out that it dosen't actually have flash 4 on it and instead has a trial of it
5,A pleasant surprise!,"I bought this on a whim and I've found it was definitely money well spent! The pan is solid and heavy - it feels just as sturdy as my professional cake pans. As another reviewer did, I used baking spray (I do with every cake!) and the finished product slid out beautifully without a hint of sticking. The pan cleaned up in moments with a little soapy water and no scrubbing necessary.With a little jam or preserves spread on the indented area and a bit of whipped cream on top, you can make a great dessert very quickly with no hassle at all. Great little pan, and one that will get a lot of use in my kitchen!"
5,Quality and value!,"I bought this pan at a ridiculously low price and really wasn't expecting much, so when I received it I was shocked! This was not the lightweight, won't last long pan I thought it would be. It's much heavier than it looks and the non-stick doesn't feel like it'll come off anytime soon. I recently made a fruit tart using this pan and it was beautiful and delicious!"
4,My daughter LOVES this desk !!!!!,"My daughter loves this desk but I did notice when I was putting this togeather one of the legs was very loose. I really did not like the fact that it was loose but I tried too fix it 3 times and even my husband tried, it just would not get tight. Other then that she loves it I love the fact that she loves it and that she is not trying too color on the walls."
4,Highly Recommend,"We just got this for our 14 mos old daughter, and she loves it. It's just the right size for little ones who can easily sit down at the desk. The extra storage under the seat and desktop are a bonus, as are all the places to put crayons and markers. There are even 2 cup holders. It appears to be quite durable; however, the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was the table top. It's not made of durable, smooth plastic like I thought it'd be - it's a laminate board (kind of like peg board without the holes), and white laminate on top. The hinges are plastic, so I'm not sure how they will last long term, but overall, I'm very satisified with this desk, as is my daughter!!"
3,step 2 write desk,We had an older desk that i loved. This new desk was not made as good as the older version. I was disappointed because there was such a difference. There was no storage under the bench and the holes for the crayons are different. The seat doesn't sit flat which causes little ones to slide off. Also no light!
1,"Simplistic, Outdated Imaging, 3rd grade level","Was hoping to take advantage of the 3D rotation of this program, the problem is that the images are too small and when zoom is employed the images are hopelessly pixilated.Not worth the price, even at 60 cents...I'd have to say that the year it came out it was OK, but still it is at best gradeschool or jr high level.Very poor...feel it was a total waste of time and money for me."
1,this is not what it looks like on the pachage,"this is not what it looks like. It came with no instructions and not even in a box, just the CD itself. I heard from the ventor and asked him to send me the box with install intructions and have not even heard from them I will never buy from these people again."
2,"Prints good, doesn't contain all features on package","The program prints very good pictures but does not contain everything on the package. The cd I received said it was a ""Lite"" version. I contacted IMSI, and they referred me to another company to call. This other company wanted a credit card for tech support information before I could talk to a live person. I am not paying for tech support to complain about a bad progam. The packaging is misleading."
2,Only kid stuff!,"Don't waste your money on this unless you're buying it for kids - all it contains as far as artwork is about a dozen different photographs. Granted, you can print them as a number of different things like calendars, but there are no other options re artwork, and all the images come out with movie ads printed over them I was entertained for about five minutes! There should be a suggested age range for both this and the companion ""Two Towers"" software."
2,"Some good arguments, but it falls way short...","This book provides a decent overview of the atheist arguement against hope, but I found it vastly incomplete. I found the author not fully understanding the implications of what he was saying. If he had, he could have written a much better book.If this topic interests you, I would recommend getting a copy of Ralph Dolhite's ""The Case Against God"". It is out of print and hard to find, but well worth the effort. It was written in the mid-to-late 30's, but still stand on its own. It also puts a humorous spin on oblivion at times, something that this book sorely lacks.One last thing. If you rearrange the letters of the author's name you get ""The Deranged Moor."""
1,Atheist philosophy of religion?,"I frankly was baffled by this book. Why spend so much time and effort to argue about something the author claims does not exist? Get some guts and just do what you want, and don't waste time trying to justify it; you don't need the tired old arguments made in this book. There is no right and no wrong. Period.Some of the reviews presented here have been equally amusing. I found the discussion of the ""atheist philosophy of religion"" quite enjoyable. ""Open your mind""? Unfortunately, if you are as open minded as the book requires, it probably means that both sides of your brain are open, and everything just flows in and then out again. You end up empty, in mind, heart and soul. Enjoy!"
3,Good quality,Seems like good quality toys so far. I dont' think it should cost so much with the manufacturing technology today but I guess that's what you pay for is the quality...
5,Schleich Sheep Standing,A very realistic looking rendition of a sheep. This one was purchased to be part of a Christmas Nativity set and fit in perfectly. I would highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a realistic looking animal figure.
4,A very useful source of data in the same place,"Another useful pocket guide for a wide range of professionals: process and mechanical engineers, designers, shop foremen, piping fitters and assemblers. A large number of data on flanges, piping, and fittings will certainly save a precious time looking for data in piles of different sources. It deserves to find its place among handful manuals to be at hand in every given point of time. Of course, one can not find in the book all information he might need. Nevertheless, this is the best source of data on the given subject I have ever come across so far."
2,Not what I expected,"The lid fits my 2.8 liter saucepan perfectly, however it is extremely light and feels a bit flimsy. My kitchen scale tells me it is 6.7 ounces, not the promised 9.6 ounces in the product description. Additionally, the lid construction is a bit dubious. There is one tiny spot weld on each end of the handle to hold the handle on. I'm not sure how long the handle will remain solidly attached to the lid.I have returned mine and will seek a better lid for my new saucepan :)"
4,Nice classic comfortable Bass shoe,"I bought my pair at a retail store during a sale, but I love my Bass Courtney's. I have them in the Burgundy - to wear with navy and khaki pants. In dim light they look black because the burgundy is very dark. They were a little tight at first and took about 3 days of wearing to break them in and to not rub the back of my heel. (I don't have a callous there so any small amount of rubbing causes great pain.) But once they broke in they turned into fantastic shoes. They have great toe room - I can freely wiggle my toes and there's no rubbing on my little toe. I'm going to buy a pair in black now."
2,A Bug In The Soup,"I own several Bicycle Game programs, and I have found flaws in each. The first is called ""Bicycle Card Collection,"" and the Cribbage Program freezes in the middle of play. Then you must resort to Ctrl. Alt. delete to get out of the program all together. While playing Gin Rummy, after the deck runs out, another deck appears, and you the player have no control over the discard cards. This program is by Microsoft.Next there is the Bicycle Board games. Dominoes does not function properly. When lying down a tile, at a certain point in the game the program skips, then lays downs several tiles in sucession, and leaves a gap on the playing board, then allows tiles to be laid just anywhere.Next there is Hoyle Board Games which operates well, though not according to the rules. There appears to be a flaw in each game. At a certain point they seem to just break down."
1,This is not a well done game,"I was hoping for some new and interesting characters, but this game has the same boring ones that my old game uses."
4,Good for stand-alone storage,"I purchased this for my magazines and craft books. I already have several different ones from various sources. This is the first time I bought this style. It is wonderful for my craft books, which I keep on a table in a corner of the living room. Very convenient to pull out one that I want. And because it flares out at the front, very easy to rifle through the books for the correct one.On the other hand, because it DOEs flare out, it is not as good for my magazines, the holders of which are lined up on a cabinet in the spare room. I will have to get a different style for that room, but it is still very handy, strong and attractive."
2,"Sorta kinda, not really","My only problem with this book is the credibility of the heroine and her sudden trasistion from vehemently rejecting the hero and insisting that fiance will come for her to falling into bed with the hero and deciding that she loves him. There was hardly any transition and while the key reasons for her to fall for him were there, there was no gradual softening. Her behavior toward Two Arrows went from winter to summer, skipping spring entirely. It ruined the book for me and it will be one of the few books that I purchase that I WILL NOT read again or keep in my collection."
5,MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!,"This my first Georgina Gentry book I've read and I will definitely be reading more of her books. Immediately after finishing it, I placed my order for another one of hers. This story was beyond touching and had me on the edge of my seat. I read it in less than two days and COULD NOT put it down! The love and passion that Two Arrows and Proud One shared was something that most dream of! I couldn't believe how this book brought me to tears. I will definitely remember this one and will reread it. I LOVED the ending! Read this, you will not be disappointed!"
2,Not much info about Enterprise Storage,"If you want basic info about I/O technology, backups and restores or removable storage, this book is an easy read. However, the two chapters that come closest to the Enterprise Storage topic were basically written by two hardware vendors and are not very useful. I bought the book based on it's title and association with Mark Minasi but wouldn't recommend it to others."
2,"A fun, but useless *toy*","My 3-year-old and 4-year-old LOVE this camera. They have learned exactly how to use it and actually do a great job with it -- so it is educational. It is also very durable and has survived a few falls. However, the picture quality is SO bad that the pictures are completely useless! They come out grainy, yellowed, and either too dark or over exposed. (I can't believe some of the customer photos on this page were taken with the same kind of camera we have because they are MUCH better!) It's a shame too because the kids have actually gotten some really great shots that I wish had been taken with a better camera...."
1,What a disappointment!,"This was the only thing my 4-year old daughter asked for Christmas and she was SO excited when she opened it. Like others said, the battery compartment is a nightmare. We spent 20 minutes trying to install the button cell battery and never succeded. The camera froze almost immediately. To fix it, you have to un-screw both sides and pull the batteries. We never got to see the quality because the camera won't run long enough.Also, the software is not kid friendly, its just some off the shelf junk. Tomorrow morning we are going to return it and get te Disney camera or something else. Fisher price, you failed us on this one!"
3,6 and up may be disappointed!,"The horrible image quality doesnt really bother my 3 year old, but it does bother my 6 year old. My 6 year old still uses it, but complains that he wants a better camera and ""why are my pictures so blurry"". So with that in mind, I would recommend this for under age 6.I cant see wasting my effort uploading any of these pictures, they are THAT bad...The kids seem to enjoy snapping everything in sight and just deleting and doing it all over again. I guess if the kids enjoy it, then the toy has met its objective, but for the price, I expect more, especially since they easily COULD have made it better."
2,Crappy Pictures,"Sure, the camera is tough and my 5 yr old thinks the games are cool, the pictures are so crappy he got bored with it in minutes. It is near impossible to take a clear picture b/c of the poor quality. If you breath the picture comes out blurry. He likes the idea, but he prefers disposables b/c he can ""see"" what he took pictures of. I am very disappointed witht his camera! It costs entirely too much for what you get!"
5,Bombproof,"My 3 year old daughter loves this camera!! She takes pictures of everything. The quality of the pictures is what you expect from a kids camera, but they are not terrible. This thing has been abused by both my 3 and 1 year old...Keeps on working!! VERY DURABLE.. Definitely worth it"
5,Great Camera for a little one,"We bought this camera for our daughter for her birthday. She has had so much fun with it. It is easy for her to use and take pictures just like mommy and daddy do. The camera has been bumped and dropped and still works great. I suggest shopping around, sometimes you can find a gift pack that includes a memory card and travel case, for the same price, or less than the camera itself, that allows your child to take more pictures and put the camera in a case like mommy does. I do however think the price is kind of high for the product you are getting. The pictures don't come out that great, good enough for a 3 year old but not good enough to put in frames and hang on the walls. When taking a picture, what shows up on the viewing screen isn't what you see through the view finder. The view finder allows the child to see a larger area then the picture they are actually taking."
2,"not durable, not easy to use!","My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday and she was so excited to use it. While it worked great for about an hour- she took 160 pictures. It holds about 80, so then we had to scroll through and delete each picture individually- there should really be a way to delete all- then she took another round. After that the battery died. And died again. And Again. You get the idea. We were using regular alkaline batteries and they would go in about 2 hours. Then we started having problems with it mysteriously freezing up. You would have to unscrew the battery compartment take the batteries out and then put them back in again, only to lose the pictures that were on there. I will be contacting customer service as soon as I can reach them when they are actually open."
4,Truly a tough toy,"My 3 year old daughter loves to take pictures of her baby sister with her new camera. It is really tough (based on the fact that it has been dropped several times and continues to work just fine). It does not take the best quality pictures, but keep in mind that this is a toy. It is slightly overpriced, but my daughter was worth it!"
2,its ok,"I bought this camera in 2006 and it broke the same year so my child didn't even get to use it more than a year. The computer inside crashed and we couldn't retrieve the pictures my child had taken. They weren't of great importance, but she loved the camera and took pride in using it herself. the batteries dont last very long in it so I would recommend rechargeable batteries or get a case of regular batteries."
4,Great Product!,"The Easter Bunny brought this camera for my 3yr old daughter and she LOVES it! She had all the buttons figured out in about 5 minutes and snapped a couple hundred pics yesterday. The memory stick the camera comes with holds about 50 so we plan on getting her a bigger one. I just simply deleted her ""bad"" shots throughout the day. The resolution isn't great, but it was awesome to see the world how she sees it from 3ft high. She really got some great shots of family and friends, all unposed and natural. I loaded her good pics to my laptop last night and she got a kick out of seeing her pics blown up."
4,kids camera,My daughter received the digital camera for her 5 birthday. She loves it. Now she can take pictures when ever she wants with her own camera and I don't have to worry about her taking pictures with my camera and dropping it. The picture aren't the best when looking at them on the camera but all you have to do is download them on the computer and they are great. Your child will love looking at all the pictures they have taken.Great camera for the young photographer.
3,"Crappy pictures, fun for kids","The pictures are really **LOW** quality. Intuitive toy for kids, they love it, but you cannot help feel that for this price the camera could have a higher definition. LCD screen pretty low quality too."
3,Too expensive for the quality,"I think many people are saying ""it's just a toy, don't be so picky."" But it's a really expensive toy and the point is they COULD have made it better picture quality for that price. Even little kids care about quality somewhat. Especially when they're comparing their pictures to Mom and Dad's"
4,Why so much on Amazon?,"Why on earth is Amazon charging $109 for this camera??? It's retail is around $50-$55 and readily available in most stores, including WalMart and Target...don't pay this outrageous price until shopping around a bit."
1,Make sure you order the NEW version -- not this one,"If you are going to order this camera make sure to order the new version. It has 1.3 mega pixels and a slightly larger LCD screen at 1.6"". It costs a little more than this model does but worth it if you want to actually keep some of the photos taken. Here is the Amazon link for it:Fisher Price Kid Tough Digital Camera - Pink (New Version)"
4,"This is the discontinued model, but get it while you can!","This model, the pink one wiith the green ring around the lense, is the discontinued model of the girls Kid Tough camera. The newer version got worse reviews which is why I looked so hard for this one. I searched online and in retail stores. Walmart, Toys R US and Target are clearing out these versions for 48.99. I found mine at a Walmart. I almost paid [...] online for it! So look around locally first...you might find one!"
4,Decent camera for 5 year old,"I bought two of these for my twin daughters. They seem to enjoy them. The pictures on the view screen could be better, but after all it is a childs camera. I is very sturdy, it has been dropped several times and still works. I will have to sa I have not uploaded any pictures to my computer from it yet. So I am not sure how the quality is there. My girls just like taking pictures and seeing them on the view screen."
5,GREAT Camera!,My daughter is 6 and she loves this camera. It's easy for her to use. She can take pictures and delete them on her own. She has dropped it a couple of times and it still works. She loves it and I would recommend it to anyone.
4,great for a 3 yr old!,"I think this is a great camera for a 3 yr old!! My daughter got it for Christmas this week (she'll be 3 in Jan.) and she had all the buttons figured out in about 5 minutes. She was able to center people in the frame, too. I was worried about getting a lot of ceiling and floor shots, but she does great! yes, the lcd screen is pretty low quality, but it's $[...] for a toddler!! What do you expect? It takes okay pictures inside, and I imagine it would take better pictures outside. The software it came with is great though! It lets you do a ton of stuff with the pictures, and is very user friendly. You can do great slideshows and share the photos online. I have even been using her software to upload my pictures from my camera to! All in all, my daughter loves it! And her being so excited about doing it herself and seeing 'her' picutres is worth more to me than a low quality lcd screen."
4,my girls love this product,I bought a pink camera for each of my three year old twins for Christmas. Its easy for them to use and they love it. I did have to return one camera to Mattel as it was draining the batteries. But they are going to send out a brand new one.We haven't downloaded any of their pictures yet so I can't comment on the photo quality.I am happy with my purchase.
3,good kid's camera,"This camera was purchased for my 4 year-old. She likes the camera, but still prefers to use mine instead. I think this is because the Kid Tough camera looks like a toy. The display screen is a little fuzzy, but is what it is intended to be - a kid tough camera."
4,Fisher Price Camera,"Bought one each for both granddaughters, 5 and 3. The 5 year old is constantly taking pictures. Loves being able to see the shot instantly. Not really interested in printing them out, so do not know yet of that quality--- but by what I've read from other reviews, not too good? But, I really don't think the 5 year old cares. The 3 year has dropped hers many times, and that is the one reason why we purchased Fisher Price. Still works!! I would buy again, if I had to do it again. However, I do wish that they were CHEAPER."
4,Too easy to delete the pictures.,"I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas. She is 22 months old and can use it very well, but she likes the sound the delete button makes. She presses the button 2 times and the picture is trashed."
1,poor quality for fisher price,i bought this for my 3 year old daughter for this christmas after fighting crowds for it. Then i thought i should check it out before i wrap it and im glad i did. takes terrible pictures. There are going to be a lot of disapointed kids out there this year to much hipe on this product. It's cheaper to buy disposible cameras and develope them for your kids i can see this as being a real novilty product as the pictures suck and would be very frusturating to a kid since kids are very smart and how do you explain to a kid why the picture dosn't look like what you took.
4,great for kids,"My granddaughter is 4 and she loved it. View finder like the old view masters, so easy for them to see subjects. Good size to hold in hands. Easy to delete and see pictures. Very sturdy, when dropped."
3,Dissapointing Image Quality,This unit is advertised as having 640x480 resolution but the quality is very low in comparison to other 640x480 camera's I have used. I would guess it is about 240x320 interpolated to 640x480. Having said that my niece enjoys the camera greatly.
4,Bottom line is our daughter loves to use it,"Price, resolution, and display quality all go out the window when your kid runs around shooting their own pictures, gaining an understanding of how a camera REALLY works (composition, creativity, capturing a special moment).Ease of use, indestructability (so far anyways), and simple uploading make it worth the other compromises.This is NOT a high tech camera, but it IS kid-friendly. We have not added the extra SD card yet, since it is so easy to upload the images.We have had ours since July, paid $59.888 for it via [...]; cannot say we have any regrets.While I do wish the resolution was better, for my photo albums sake, I would still recommend this camera."
5,Great fusion workout,"This is a great workout. The meditation at the beginning really focuses your mind, and the combination of strength and yoga moves builds muscle and improves flexibility at the same time. It's good if you're getting bored with a more traditional workout as well."
3,Route 66 blue neon clock,"I received your Route 66 blue neon clock today. I was very pleased with your prompt delivery on this item;However in the Amazon advertisement it was stated thatthe clock weighed 8 pounds, that is not correct the entire package including packaging materials only weighed3 pounds. I suggest that you check and change that information. I purchased a clock that was suppose to weigh 8 pounds, however it only weighed 3!!The picture on the face of the clock is really nice butif I may make a suggestion; Please consider having a wider variety of nostalgic pictures from that era."
3,"Good Shoes, Flimsy shoelaces","Shoes are OK, may be somewhat below average by Clarks standard. But the shoelaces were lower quality, and broke within 6 months. I heard somewhere that Clarks has started manufacturing shoes just for the internet mass market. May be that is being reflected here."
2,I expected more out of Clarks,"These are well-made, nice looking casual shoes. I've had them about 2 months now and they're holding up great. I work in the office and wear these about 3-4 days a week. My biggest complaint is that there is no cushioning in the shoes. The insole is very thin. After 1 week I bought Dr. Scholl's gel insoles just so these would feel comfortable. I wear these for about 9-10 hours per day so comfort is very important to me. The shoes are slightly longer than other shoes I've purchased, but I've been told that Clarks tend to run long. The soles don't have much tread, so I wonder what they'll be like on snowy and icy sidewalks this winter."
3,At least a size too big.,"My husband ordered this shoe in his regular size, 10, at a great discount on Amazon. The shoe was at least a size too big, and to reorder at a smaller size would have cost twice as much, as the price had gone up in the few days since he ordered. Too bad, as he really liked the shoe."
5,We love Mouse House!,"When my oldest was a toddler we discovered Mouse House at the library and checked it out over and over. It's a very sweet British Claymation program, perfect for quiet and restful times."
3,Lots of caves and holes in Guam.,"Didn't realize there were so many caves and holes in Guam, both on land and below in the ocean. Unfortunately, we did not find a use for this guide. Perhaps if we had stayed longer in Guam, or perhaps if we were divers this guide would have been more useful. Looks well done, though."
4,What An Action Filled Read,"Mark Crockett has done excellent job in penning this story, which will have you on edge the entire time you are reading. Two homeless men Chickenhead and Jamaica set out to find the killer of Mimi Driver. Mimi, also homeless was the girlfriend of Chickenhead. The police department becomes nerved and on edge after finding out Mimi is the daughter of a prominent Mayor. Chickenhead and Jamaica outraged at the fact the police cannot catch this brutal murderer; they decide to take matters into their own hands. They get so close to the killer they can touch him. Will they find out who the murderer is or will the murderer them out first and murder them? If you like an action pack read, this is the book for you!!!"
1,Terrible,These are the worst Queen size stockings I ever puchased. A total waste of money.Stick to stockings and a garter belt.
5,On the small side,I actually wanted a 4x and thought these might be large enough for me to use - nowhere near. They would have been tight on me when I wore 3x too.
5,Wonderful and uplifting,"This great little book has done a lot to help me feel better during some stressful times. I did not expect it to lean so heavily on religion (specifically Christianity), but I find that it has not only helped me stay positive, but has helped me reconnect to god. I am not a Christian, but this hasn't deterred me at all from the book. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to improve their outlook on life."
2,pierogi maker.,Just recieved this today. Came with one of the handles unscrewed. have to go get it repaired as i cant get a screwdriver into small space to fix it.Im not happy with the thinness of it. It looked heavy in photo but it is more like tin .Not worth $24.77.
4,pretty.,"got here fast and packaged well, i do have to mention that the pearls are not perfectly round, or the same exact size like in the picture. i'm guessing that how pearls turned out and with the price that i paid for it, these are perfect. i have to also mention that these are a little bit more weighted than if you buy pearl necklace that are perfect looking with the same price."
5,Love these,Bought for my 16 year old granddaughter for Easter. Her first string of real pearls....what a treasure they are..weighty and just beautiful
2,Pairng Problem,This ear peace does not pair with two phones as advertised. I'm on my second unit and it still doesn't work.
2,Looking for a new headset,"After owning this headset for the last six months, I am rather disappointed. I should have watched the video reviews before I bought the item. Just as one of the reviewers said, the earpiece that actually fits in the ear is coming apart. Also, the noise reduction does not work so well -- if the car you are driving experiences moderate road noise, the microphone will pick it up. Most of those who I called while driving said they could not hear me.For the first few months, this headset was great, but now I will be buying something else."
5,Jabra bt5020,"I bought this as a replacement. It provides excellent quality and service. It may not hurt to have a little louder volumen on the headset, but if you place the ear piece correctly, the quality is really good.Never feel when I have it on."
4,Great Headset,I am truly a fan of jabra products this is my 4th or 5th Jabra headset and it is great much smaller then the others I have used very clear and easy to where. I even play my music thru the headset. I would reccommend anyone that has small ears or cant find that right fit try the over the ear Jabra you will love it.
4,jabra bt 5020,"The sound quality is great, my friends say that its like I am talking on a regular phone. My only problem is keeping the ear gel attached to the headset."
5,My Jabra review,"I purchased this headset for my new phone because I already have one and I like the comfort and fit. This purchase was not for myself but for my spouse, we needed to get a new headset for him and I know how comfortable my Jabra is so I asked him to try it out and if he liked the fit then we would order him one. The fit over your ear is really good, it is not tight or annoying and you can't see the blue light going off peripherally while wearing the headset, which can be annoying in itself.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good headset."
1,"Great form/fit, HORRIFIC FUNCTION","Bought the BT5020 to use with my Blackberry Pearl, to replace my Jabra BT250. Fit/finish/form and comfort are much better (for my ear) than the 250. However, the functionality of this 5020 is horrible. There is massive static, crackling and general comms interruptions even when the phone is 12 inches from the headset. Totally unacceptable. On the calls I've made with this headset, the other party has said it sounded like I was ""on the moon"" or orbiting earth in the space shuttle. Unacceptable and a total disappointment."
1,Falls apart,"I purchased the Jabra BT5020 for my husband he had a 250 before and loved it but he lost it. I ordered the 5020 because it was smaller and lighter. The first on fell apart the first time he wore it they sent another one he has worn it a few times and loves the size, however a week ago he came home with it in his hand said he took it off and it fell apart also. Jabra makes good products and we have been happy with them in the past however I would not purchase this item again."
1,It stinks! Deserves a zero star rating,"In replacing a well-used Jabra BT250v, I made the mistake of choosing a Jabra BT5020. The technology found in a ""Dixie cup and a string"" produces better quality sound (I'm from south Alabama; I have experience in such things).Purchase this product only if you have absolutely no need for a headset."
2,Jabra 5020,Many complaints that people cannot hear me with this headsetJabra BT5020 Executive Bluetooth Headset
2,Junk,I bought the BT5020 based on its' Best Buy recommendation from Consumer Reports. I'm very disappointed with my decision. The headset broke after a few weeks of gentle handling - the earpiece literally fell apart when I picked it up one day. Absolutel junk. I'm going back to Motorola.
1,Jabra doesn't fit,the most uncomfortable device I ever bought. returned immediately. jabra forgot how to do it on this one
1,Is not a stereo headset,It doesn't work if you want to listen to music with it. It will work as a regular headset for incoming and outgoing calls.
4,Jabra BT5020,"Good product. I had a previous headset that I had difficulty hearing. The Jabra has excellent sound. Poeple have no difficulty hearing me either.The only downside is that it's not quiet as comfortable as I was expecting from previous reviews. I have to move it around to find a comfort zone. Having said this, I must point out that I never could find a comfortable position for my old headset (must be my Vulcan ears).Still, it's a good product that I would highly recommend."
1,The Earbuds are a joke,The earbuds for this headpiece are a joke.They fall off continually and I lost the only one it came with in the first 3 days.Nothing but hassles trying to find replacement earbuds.STAY AWAY FROM THIS HEADSET !
1,hope that you don't have large ears,this sounded good but could not keep in in the ear even with old jabra ear-gels- did not come out from under the ear which made it hard for the mike to pickup. sent it back and got the jabra BT-530 it has more adjustments to fit the ear.
3,"Competent, but not spectacular","Works fairly well but does NOT cancel noise nearly as well as the Jawbone II (That's OK, the Jawbone had LOTS of other drawbacks and I returned it to buy this one). I was more used to the Jabra 250 style of earbud and the earpiece on this one seems a little odd...and not as comfortable. Further, the BT5020 doesn't like my phone much (Samsung Blackjack II) and if the phone isn't within 3-4 feet of the headset, without any obstruction between them, there can be a lot of static (this may be a phone problem). Overall, the product works and is very comfortable."
4,Pleased with headset,"Very pleased with the excellent fit on ear, sound quality and features. Have used previous models from Jabra as well. Only criticism is in regards to rubber ear piece cover which does come off easily if headset is left in pocket, etc."
1,BT 5020 Rejected,"I had a BT 200, it worked OK, with some wind noise. The holstered phone had to be on the same side of the body. It lasted a year.So I got the upgrade BT 5020. Big disappointment. I have a deep voice and it can not hear my voice unless I'm shouting. My wife has a much higher voice and it did not work for her either.The audio in the ear piece is great, but if I move the phone to the opposite side of my body, the sign get bad.I have returned the headset to Amazon"
2,I can't hear anything,"I bought this product for my husband and when he is using it, I cannot hear a word he is saying! I don't know if his head is too big and the speaker just won't reach or what but we've had a lot of complaints about it from his customers. We are sending it back."
1,Poor Quality,This product is extremely uncomfortable to wear and the sound resistance isn't any better as it claims. I wish Jabra would go back to making the 500v...the Jabra bt5020 is the only product they make currently with the vibrating feature. The older versions are much better!!! Do not buy this product!!!
2,half baked,"This device showed much promise when I first laid eyed on it. Upon further inspection and demonstration, The slick looking earpiece is surprisingly difficult to put on my ear, the earpiece and its telescopic, rotating design is suspect to me. It looks like a liability in design that may have bitten me in the posterior a year or so down the road, should I have decided not to return it.Ultimately the reception in the earpiece was its achilles heel. It had an unacceptable amount of static intermittently despite my attempts to alleviate them by repositioning and re-installing it on my phone. (People on the other line said the sound quality was good on their end)In the 21st century, any device like this needs to perform nearly flawlessly, its peers do."
1,Very bad connection,"People can not hear me when using this bluetooth and I bought it because of the multiple line, which I have not try yet. I won't recommend this device"
2,Poor quality,"Although it's light weight and very comfortable to wear, I got a lot of complaints from the other side about staticy and scratchy reception. Some of the voicemails I had left people were completely incomprehensible according to the ones who could at least find out who was calling them."
1,"Jabra BT5020 ""sad piece of equipment""","The look, the style. This had to be a good headset...I was so terribly disappointed. I purchase two of them, just to make sure that I hadn't just bought a defective one. No luck with either one. Static, buzzing...I had to hold the phone so close to it, I might as well have taken off the headset and put the phone up to my ear. Please don't waste your money on this headset."
1,unacceptable,I expected good audio performance with this unit. I was shocked to find that the voice quality made phone conversations impossible. I can't find any adjustments that might improve the performance. I stuffed it in a drawer as a keepsake to remind me not to buy things I haven't tried.
1,hard to wear,"I have glasses, and I could not get this thing to stay on my ear. I have had bluetooth earphones before, but I never had one that I couldn,t get to work correctly. In no way could I get the earpiece to fit in my ear correctly. I just gave up on it and bought a different one."
4,Good for PS3,"I only use this when I play co-op on the PS3. Setup was easy and straightforward. I don't usually play for more than 3 hours at a time and it's never died on me. No one has complained about the sound quality of my voice. The range is fine since I don't sit too far from my TV, but if I go down the hall, maybe 25 ft. away and around a corner, it does cut out. The earpiece is very comfortable and adjustable. I also like the rubber cover you can put over the earpiece as it adds comfort. Also, it comes with two of them, so if you're a germ freak and you ever share your headset, you have an alternate ear piece. Because of the over-the-ear design, the mic essentially sits under the earlobe and I was worried that it would be too far from my mouth, but it actually picks up my voice just fine."
3,"BT5020 - Good headset, Breaks Easily","I've owned several Jabra headsets (BT200, BT250, BT500, BT2020).The 5020 is the best one I've owned with respect to BlueTooth capability and sound quality.It is the worst for durability. I'm on my third one. The earbud/speaker portion of the headset is poorly designed and will come apart, requiring a warranty claim.I like the headset but hate the little flimsy, easily breakable, earpiece."
4,Jabra BT5020 Executive Bluetooth Headset,"The fellow who has the video review of this Jabra BT5020 Bluetooth Headset put it into his pocket and broke it. I have not had this problem at all as I have been reasonably careful with the device as it is small.It works fine, connects with my phone, and is lightweight and comfortable to wear.Two things should be revised by Jabra in their next effort: First, my friends tell me that it is not quite as clear as my old Jabra 250V headset as it seems whatever sound dampening technology they have incorporated provides a less clear sound. Secondly, the ear jells slip off of the unit very easily and they should redesign them so they stay on. I have put a small rubber band on the jell so that it is not lost if slips off."
1,unsatisfied,"Was excited with the smaller size than my bt500, but definitly not an improvement. First off they should not have changed the earbud type that existed, it was great. The ear piece or if you choose to use it the earbud on the bt5020 does not help to secure it to your ear. Nothing but static the whole time I would try to talk on it, it did not lie snuggly next to my jaw line like the bt500, which I really loved. But over all those things, this was the most uncomfortable ear piece I have every worn. I can wear the bt500 for days and it never bothered me, but within an hour of wearing this one, the back of my ear became very sore. They need to make a jabra more similar to the bt500, just smaller and lighter like the bt5020, and keep the shape rounded and smooth, AND DON'T CHANGE THE EARBUD!!!!!"
3,"A practical design, finally","This is my third Bluetooth headset and a big improvement over the first two:1. Unlike the others, this avoids blinking at the world while in use.2. Sitting behind the ear, it is much less obvious when not in use.3. So comfortable that you forget you're wearing it after a few minutes.However, there are a few drawbacks:1. On a large ear, the mouthpiece is easily covered by the earlobe.2. The earphone stalk is fragile and can easily be broken. One expects more from something that is, after all, an appliance.It shares a few negative features with my other headsets:1. Poor volume, with either of my two phones (probably due to the mouthpiece placement).2. Frequent disconnection from the phone which requires me to delete and rediscover the device."
2,Not for ears that stick out,"Bought this for my girlfriend and it would not stay on her ear. Turns out her ears stick out a bit, and this unit depends on your ear being snug to your head in order to hold it in place. So, beware of this unit if your ears stick out at all.So, now it is mine . . . but I am disappointed that the connection gets staticky when I put my Razr phone in my pants pocket. Even when I have the phone on the same side of my body as the earphone, as recommended -- unfortunately, I bought this at CompUSA before Christmas and since they are closing all their stores, I can't return it. Fortunately, it was marked down 30%, but I am wondering how long it will be before I grow too tired of this unit.I can't say I recommend it."
1,I really wanted to like this,I purchased this headset because it was highly rated by a consumer magazine. They are usually right on. I was disappointed with this headset. The quality of the sound from the earpiece was low. A lot of crackling. I was also told that what others heard on the other end of the call was poor. I sounded very far away to them and there were breaks in my voice. I ultimately decided to return the item.
2,No password connection,The Jabra BT5020 that arrive would not connect with my Treo 700. The password supplies would not work. The unit was returned to Jabra for exchange.
3,Comfortable - but other people say hard to hear me,"This is a very comfortable headset - very light weight, fits easily into ear and stays there. I can clearly hear people on my end. However, several people have stated when talking to me that it is hard to hear me and there is a lot of background noise."
2,It is good but not reliable headset,I used to use BT headsets for long time and tried many different models so I have something to compare. I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear. Unfortunately mine earbud died in few month.. bluetooth reception became poor and finally radio part completely stopped to function.. headset can't be discovered by any phone now. I did online search and found many similar cases with diffirent Jabra producs which is sad.. now came back to Plantronics which works flawless (had 4 diff models and no problems)..
3,Good Quality,I'm really impressed with the quality of this product. It works well with the phone and I only have to adjust it slightly. I only have to be careful with adjusting the earpiece due to the fit and it will slip off.
2,Not great,"Had significant issues with 2 different of these units. Lots of echoing, lots of background noise and it died after about 2 months. The insert they give you for your ear is crap and continued to fall off."
3,"Nice, but wouldn't recommend. hey almost got it.","The quality and pairing process were quite simple. I use this device with my cell phone and my Notebook computer. On the notebook I use it to make calls through Microsoft Office Communicator, and Instant Messaging tool. Sweet...PRO: Good sound quality. Noice reduction is okay, but not as good as advertized. They need to look at the Jawbone. Pairing was simple, and I love the short USB cable so I wrap the cable with the cell phone cable and both charge from the Notebook.CON: Don't like the swivel for choosing ears. and the rubber earpiece doest stay on, nor does it fit in ear well. Jabra cornered the market with the style the BT 250 and 500 use. If it aint broke, don't fix it. The BT250 design is by far the best earpiece design I've worn. Jabra needs to work on noise cancellation. I only bought this unit becasue of the ""spec"" of it working in wind with noise reduction. Like I said, it's ""ok"" but not ""great"". Sending back and buying the BT 500."
1,Does not work with Blackberry Pearl,"Make sure you DON'T buy this if you have a Blackberry Pearl (8100). It simply does not work. I checked online and lots of people are complaining about the same so it seems to be a generic compatibility problem with the Pearl. The headset looks great, it's extremely comfortable and seems to work perfectly fine with other phones."
2,It's MADE IN CHINA,It's Made In China. The finish looks cheaper than in the picture. Certainly not worth $25.
2,Clichéd,"The book was okay, as was Weathersby's writing. She had some very good, descriptive parts, like her description of a hurricane's movements--tops, I really liked that. But the vampire stereotypes were rather tacky and clichéd, and killed this book for me. I felt the story was rather weak, as was the characterization. I did like the fact that Casey, the main character, was not your usual beauty queen heroine you usually get in vampire novels.I suppose this novel didn't rock my boat because I'm not a fan of stereotypical vampires, and because I've read much better contemporary vampire tales, such as Brent Monahan's The Book of Common Dread and its sequel.In conclusion, it bored me, and I felt like I had to fight my way through to finishing it. But I think this is a ""like it or hate it"" type of book. If you love vampires, look for it at the library, because you might end up liking it much more than I did. :)"
2,"Beware the word ""Silver"" refers to the color, not the metal material!","It seems to be all thin silver-colored plastic wrappings all around the plastic core, and the only metal is the handle. It's nice looking, though. It's just not up to the worth of the price."
3,Nice looking plastic bucket,"This bucket is made of PLASTIC. Perhaps this should have been obvious given the price, but I tend to give Amazon a lot of credit for good pricing so it wasn't obvious at the time of purchase. As a result, the bucket is nice to look at, but not impressive if you pick it up/touch it."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is extremely out of date and there are many other books out there that are more helpful. For example, this book doesn't even mention sentinel lymph node biopsies which are now the standard of care. Save your money."
2,Lighting is very poor for VHS version,I should have read the previous review before making the decision. The lighting for Act I is so poor that you can only see a group of blue objects moving on the stage. And the Applauds in the performance is so frequent and very annoying! Recommend to wait for better production
4,old skool,J.T. great man of music the concert is pretty good sound is good visual is good too oh and j.t. daughter performs she is beautiful and has a great voice so j.t. fans dont miss out on this one cant go wrong
2,Most of the reviews on this page are by the artist,"Be very aware of the fact that this artist has written at least two and probably three of the reviews on this page (mellowin man and Richard Davidson). For music to be truly rated five stars it has to have a presence and stature. This is not the case with this album. At best, this album would just pass if you were playing it as background music at a party. Never trust something that has five stars by everybody that rates it."
5,A must-read for any new parent,"I frequently buy this gift for new moms! I read it and it made me completely rethink my parenting ideas. More than anything, this book will cause you to question all of the ""wisdom"" we have here in the West around what babies need and what is right for them.The author takes a look at how babies were probably raised back when we were all cavemen, essentially - how long did moms breastfeed? Where did babies sleep? etc. - and which of these things might make a difference to babies today?The U.S. has one of the highest infant mortality rates of any industrialized nation [...]. If we understood babies and what they need better, maybe we could change that for the better."
5,an excellent and thought provoking book,"As a first time parent I was unsure about how to handle all the millions of decisions regarding care of my baby and was confused and frustrated by conflicting advice and opinions. This book put things into a larger context and gave some insight on why we tend to emphasize certain things in our culture. It opened up other ways of thinking about parenting and helped me gain self confidence. It demonstrated that much of the ""conventional wisdom"" is often based on cultural or personal opinions, but not on science or infant biology. An excellent thought provoking book about what we value as a culture and how this translates into our parenting."
2,Disappointing,"I was eager to read this book to get an objective view of different child rearing styles around the world. Although the book does include some interesting descriptions of how children are raised in other parts of the world, it is not objective. The author is clearly a supporter of attachment parenting and that bias is obvious throughout the book."
5,excellent overview of the influences of culture in parenting,This is an easily read and fascinating book. It points out the influence of American values to raise independent and self reliant children. These values lead to parenting practices which do not take into account the biology of infants. She gives an excellent overview of current scientific studies of infants behavior as it relates to cry and sleep..I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering parenthood.
5,Cross-cultural perspective,A wonderful glimpse into how several cultural groups choose to raise their children and insights into what cultural values these choices reinforce. Reminded me that the mainstream wisdom does not necessarily serve my values and gave me the nudge to stay strong in some of the choices I am making (e.g. breastfeeding) even when society seems to be raising its eyebrow. Also a good reminder that mainstream wisdom does not always serve the health and welfare of either babies or moms.
5,The Thinking Parent's Parenting Book,"There is a lot of solid research packed in here, but presented in a coherent, accessible way with lots of great examples. This book is for parents who want to open their minds to other ways of parenting. Rather than telling you: Do this!, Small presents the research, links biology, evolution and culture, and gets YOU to wonder about what's best. By discussing the child-rearing approaches of other cultures, Small provokes us to look at our own in a new way. I've used this book both for work (my field is child development) as well as for personal use & reflection (I'm a mother of a 17 month old). Fantastic read! I also recommend ""A World of Babies"" if parenting across cultures interests you."
5,A Must Read!,After you read this you will want to throw away 75% of your other baby books. This is a fascinating book which will be 'eye-opening' to most Americans. READ THIS BOOK.
2,"Nothing new, boring",I purchased this book after reading all of the rave reviews of it but found it to be very weak. I absolutely am on board witj attachment/evolutionary parenting but this book is nothing but a poorly written ramble about what the author thinks. I wanted to read in depth about the actual tribal practices but that information makes up a tiny portion of the book. I found the book boring. If you need an Introduction to these concepts that is at least profound if unfortunatly also poorly written try the continuum concept instead.
3,Cheap but functional,"I get a little nervous putting massive torque on these but no breaks yet. They work and they are pretty cheap, what more can you ask?"
2,Weak construction,Used the 3/4 F to 1/2 M adapter to loosen an axle nut. As soon as I put some force on the breaker bar the adapter split in half. Maybe the smaller ones will last as you would not use them for big tight bolts/nuts but I would not recommend based on my experienced. Returned for a refund.
5,Great addition to socket set,I have used a few of the adapters. Work great. Handy to have. Well worth the money. Deliver was on time.
2,don't waste your money,i thought this was a great product until after about 6 weeks the zipper broke. for $15 i expected it to last alot longer.
2,Waste of money,"The zipper is pretty crappy and cheap, sometimes it unthreads itself from just pressure places on the casing. Also its very tight and compact and makes putting the headphones in it a slow and tedious process. Not something I would recommend for someone that wants to quickly put away their headphones on the go."
2,"Hard to use, but durable.","I was expecting the interior to have some kind of winding mechanism, but you have to wind it yourself... which in and of itself isn't a big deal, except that there's almost no room between the core that you wrap your cord around and the zipper; this means you have to keep it under pretty high tension while wrapping, and the lid gets in the way of that. My earbuds also barely fit in the space alloted, so they tend to want to flop out while I'm winding. Once I get it wrapped up and closed, it's a great case, but usually I'm frustrated by that point...."
5,Best Holiday Album Owned,"This Holiday album was a real treat. This album had such a relaxing jazzy feel to it throughout. ""December Lullaby"" is a spunky upbeat song featuring her four year old daughter Sasha.""Merry Christmas, Darling"" a dedication to Rick Fox. This song, kind of gives you an insight of how Vanessa or anyone feel when they have that special someone missing for the Holidays.Ossie Davis is also featuring on this album in a reading of Langston Hughes ""I Dream a World"". This album is definitely a great Holiday album and the best Holiday Album I own."
5,Vanessa's back,"Ms. Williams makes her triumphant return to music with this Christmas classic. A very good album, and should be bought with her 1st Christmas album, Star Bright, for a complete beautiful holiday season. Vanessa looks and sounds better than ever! My favorite track is ""Joy To The World"" with Mr. McKnight. Silver & Gold, is really what is says, and will last many holiday seasons for years to come. Pick this one up!"
3,Larry Coryell sounds nothing like Hendrix,"Larry Coryell is a jazz-based guitarist, Hendrix was a blues-based guitarist. They sound NOTHING like each other. I have no idea what the reviewers below are talking about. They must be rather young and not have lived through the era and experienced what music was like at the time. A little distortion does not make one sound like Hendrix.Larry Coryell is a fantastic guitarist, but this album is kind of dated. Not that there's anything wrong with that. However, in his later albums, he developed his real style."
3,The Platters,ou ask for my review - I can't even get to order it - something is wrong with your ordering system - the poor folks who one to sell - can't even get them
1,Snowflakes and Platters,"Collecting PLATTERS tunes is almost like gathering snowflakes-- there's many that seem alike, yet examine them closely and you'll notice minor (and major) differences. In fact, such a plethora of PLATTERS re-recordings exists, it's hard to tell if the tracks here are the first, second, third (and so on) remakes issued by these ambitious recyclers.In the end, it doesn't matter which copies they are though-- if not the original FEDERAL or MERCURY label 1950's sides, the songs aren't worth the plastic and metal they're etched into.Put these Platters back on the shelf for ""safe-keeping."""
4,No more packing extra batteries!,"Our son is 3.5, and loves to take this on trips. The cord is long enough to reach from the backseat of our Accord to the console power outlet. My opinion is that the cord could be a little longer, but most cars have multiple outlets now anyway. It is great, but be sure and unplug the VideoNow when you turn off the car or it WILL drain your battery."
2,Shallow introduction to Java Web services,"This book is essentially a rewrite of the free Java Web Services Developer Pack Tutorial from Sun. The book's writing is clear and the explanations are good but the text covers only introductory level topics. I expect a good textbook to go into a topic in depth, to point out problem areas, advanced techniques and the ""gotchas"" of a library (e.g., Jason Hunter's excellent ""Java Servlet Programming""). All the screenshots and double-spaced code examples hide the fact that there's not much information here.The security chapter has nothing to do with Web services at all but is an introduction to JSSE; nice, but not what I paid for.Also, one of the book's advertised features is a web site with an ""Ask the Author"" section but I never got a response to either of my questions.Deitel's ""Java Web Services"" is a far better choice."
2,"An overview of basic topics, but fails for anything beyond","I've gone through several web services books looking for information about SOAP with Attachments. When I got to this book, I was surprised that it was actually giving incorrect information. Regarding SwA it says that binary data can't be sent inside of XML, so you need to use SOAP with Attachments (pg. 208). This is completely wrong, since binary data can be embedded in XML.The book was already written pretty poorly before I got to this part. Once I hit this part, I knew this book was bad. The author obviously does not know much about XML, so how could you trust him/her on any uses of XML?I give this a 2 over a 1 just because it does cover the very basics."
4,"Good, Good, Good","This book like the others in the series is great. My 4 yr old & 14month old love both this book. The pictures are vivid, the text is simple...a perfect jump-off for an engaging conversation about the similarities we all share throughout the world."
4,Nice world culture book for PreK and K,"Simple book with nice pictures, helps children to develop awareness of different cultures. Good for Kindergarten and Pre-K. 17 different countries represented."
1,Baltimore Bore,"This author hits all the low lights on his way to telling a far too predictable tale about a murder in Charm City. His main characters are hollow stereotypes, and the story went absolutely nowhere fast. I couldn't get past the first hundred pages. Yawn. Save your money."
5,fun on flu medicine,"I had a terrible flu and a stack of books. This one was the most distracting. I loved Hitch's voice and his profession--not too many mortician sleuths out there. I was not surprised by the big plot twist at the end, but so what? I'll take an ""needlessly handsome"" undertaker over a mind-blowing finish any day."
3,Shaggy dog story.,"Having just finished reading this rather lengthy debut novel, my immediate reaction is one of ambivalence. On the positive side is Tim Cockey's appealing style of writing. He has a way with words that makes for an easy and largely pleasurable reading experience. ""The Hearse You Came In On"" contains plenty of good natured humor, an abundance of quirky characters and a nice feel for the ambience of Baltimore.On the negative side is the plotting which I'd have to describe as both overly ambitious and haphazard. There's just too much going on in this book and tying everything together requires too many far fetched, obviously contrived plot elements and a dismaying amount of exposition.Bottom line: Tim Cockey's talent as a writer is quite apparent but ""The Hearse You Came In On"", his debut novel, could have been far better had the editing been more aggressive. Three stars."
4,A really good start:,"When I read the premise of an undertaker that solves mysteries, I was already hooked.This book was a fresh concept, and kept me laughing and turning the pages rapidly. I look forward to reading more from this series/author.Happy Reading!"
3,The Hearse You Came In On,"A page turner from the first paragraph. Interesting concept in that the main character, Hitchcock Sewell, is the blandest of all the other characters in the book. He is the absolute perfect foil for his zany ex-wife, the complicated female detective, the ruthless politcal candidate, the ever pushy old school chum, his wry ex-inlaw local tavern owners, to name but a few. The fact that Hitch and his aunt own a funeral home doesn't really play a major part in the storyline except for the mention of a few oddball wakes and funerals here and there and it is used as the venue for the 2 main characters to meet and begin the mystery. Snappy dialogue and fast pace makes for a good solid read. Will definitely buy Cockey's next book."
2,Too wordy,I got alot of recommendations about this book. I wish I could say the book lived up to the reviews I had heard. However it didn't. Personally I thought the book was a bit of a yawner. The author obviously enjoyed reading his own words because the book could have been shortened to about half of it's 320 pages. The book kind of droned on and on. The characters were flat and you never really cared who dunnit!!
4,"Another winner of the ""Great Title"" Award","This title gets one of my ""Great Title"" awards - right up there with ""Helen Hath No Fury"" - but the book itself is somewhat uneven. The title, of course, is a paraphrase of part of an invective, which, IMHO, is better appropriated in James Carville's ""And the Horse He Rode In On: the People v. Kenneth Starr.""""Hearse You Came In On"" is a fun (yes, some funeral directors can be fun - ask Oprah and her friend Stedham or my friends Robert, Jeff & Diane) murder mystery that introduces a delightful new cast. The ending would leave us wondering, except that the publisher, to entice us into reading the next book ""Hearse of a Different Color"" (another candidate for ""Great Title"" award - this one a paraphrase of the famous horse in ""The Wizard of Oz,"") has included a blurb and the first chapter of this sequel at the end of ""Hearse You Came In On."""
3,Half as long would have been better!,"I had a number of problems with this book. The main character, Hitch, was wry and amusing, almost to the point of annoying. I didn't feel I ever really got to know any of the characters, much less care about what happened to them. The story was way, way too long-it should have been about half the length it was. It took a long time to get to the mystery of the story, by which time I wasn't certain I even cared. Cockey shows talent, but a severe editing of his work and much more focus on the characters and the main story would improve it."
2,Wish it was half as fun as the reviews led me to believe,"I was expecting a laugh out loud type of book, if I believed the reviews. Instead I found a too long book with a wry undertaker, whose witticisms were at best, forced. This book had it all - politics, sex, mystery, and theater- perhaps to appeal to a wider audience. I will try his next book in the hope that he settles down and writes a good mystery. As for this book, I think the best thing was the title! Oh and rotaries in Boston are called rotaries, not roundabouts."
4,Hitchcock's Hearse: A great Undertaking,"For mystery buffs who are looking for something different, here's a suspense/detective yarn with a sprinkling of laughs - even a corpse by the name of Sprinkle. Lots of zany, wonderful characters, and I'm still wondering if Carol, and ex-Maine saloon owner, is still holed up in the Fells Point hotel, ready to make another appearance in Cockey's sequel. Yep, I recommend this book for a lighter respite from all the novels about serial killers."
4,A Solid Mystery/Thriller with a Touch of Fun,"I am not a huge fan of this particular genre of fiction but every once in awhile it's fun to sit down with a good thriller. Fortunately, this one has all the earmarks of the best in the field. It is clever and funny with an engaging narrator, odd characters and plenty of twists and turns. It's a quick read and a fun way to spend an afternoon.I originally picked it up because the narrator is a funeral director and I come from a family three generations into the business. Having spent plenty of time in the environment, I thought it would be fun to see a little excitement added to the profession. Of course, this was a mistake. It was fun but there were things that just didn't ring true. Fortunately, Sewell's work is only incidental to the story.Other than that (apart from language that got a little flowery on occasion), I had a good time with this novel. I'm interested to see how the characters develop in future novels."
4,Jolly good fun!,"Browsing through the bookstore as I am apt to do on a weekend, I was attracted to this book by its clever title and the cute little hearses on the cover. THE HEARSE YOU CAME IN ON is a highly entertaining and hilariously funny mystery, reminiscent of the best screwball comedies of the 30's. In a genre that seems to be cluttered by tortured, angst-ridden protagonists, Hitchcock Sewell is a truly original and refreshing change. He's young, handsome (if he does say so himself) and an undertaker!With its likeable characters, razor sharp wit and snappy dialogue, THE HEARSE YOU CAME IN ON draws you in from the first sentence and keeps you turning pages. I look forward to many more books featuring undertaker/sleuth Hitchcock Sewell!"
3,Almost,"I really wanted to like this book, but somehow it just missed the mark for me. It was filled with quirky characters in a radiant setting...but they didn't ring true and I couldn't hold onto the sense of place. Plus, I ""figured it out"" pretty early on, and it became painful to bear witness to Murmur's one-dimensionally neurotic friends' poor behavior and totally undeveloped coping skills. Despite the unlikability of all the central characters, I became emotionally engaged, even though I felt like I had been tricked into the engagement by trite devices, such as cancer ridden wives and children. The epliepsy incident was garish but amusing.Still, the overall message (as finally learned by Murmur before she turns into a plant) is valuable for all women and makes it worth the quick and easy read."
1,One small step above watching TV,"I know this is a popular series, but we just don't get it. The game is chock full of MTV-style cartoon music videos, and our son just gravitates towards making them play over and over. He only occasionally gets bored enough to try some of the supposedly educational games, and gets little out of them.He's a bright three year old who does well with some other educational software (including BabyWow and Reader Rabbit) so I blame the software, not him. It will indeed keep him entertained and out of his parents' hair for long periods of time, but it's educational in about the same way that a Snickers bar is nutritional: lots of candy, with a few just barely helpful nuggets inside.We don't let him play this any more."
5,Absolutely outstanding,"This was my first Black Lace purchase, and I was very very impressed. If you are interested in all out erotica at its finest, this is an excellent book to whet your appetite! I highly recommend this story if you're looking to add some spice!"
2,Lint city,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this cloths edges sheds lint. Give it a shake - little yellow balls go flying. Rub down your strings - little yellow balls abound."
3,Not effective as described!,"Although I respect the Planet Waves brand (and LOVE my PW string winder), I found this cloth to be largely ineffective in use. I purchased 3 of these to wipe-down my guitars after playing (plus I gave my guitar playing grandsons one as well). None of the cloths did much for removing (or shining)the light, normal smudges. A positive: our guitars weren't scratched during use of same! I'll look elsewhere for a more effective product."
4,"Good, but large",Works fine as expected... was my own dumb fault for not checking the dimensions before placing the order. It's a rather large cloth and takes up space when folded over for a tablet side pocket.
2,Ink on the Planet Waves logo bled upon wash,Ok polishing cloth for the price. Not as good as the white freebie that could beobtained at Guitar Ctr. Planet Waves logo now looks like a mess as I washed it inWoolite in the sink in an attempt to make it fluffier.
3,war movies fan,"have not seen the movie,another one for the future,but got the dvd in good condition,and fast,I assume the ficks well be great.I am satisfied with amazon"
5,"No problems, and an improvement.","Appropriate value. Used this to simplify my son's Magna Excitor 20"". Had a 3 sprocket chainring (current model no longer does), which proved a bit complex for my 8 year old, who is learning to ride and is easily frustrated. Frankly, with 20"" tires, smaller front sprockets are not needed. Gear range is more practical with this single, which is 2 teeth larger than the largest sprocket from the triple."
1,Not quite 110bcd!,"Marked as 110, it comes VERY close - but the chainring bolt holes are shaped like ice cream cones, and the chainring bolt just barely won't fit in the holes. It'll fit in the widest part of the hole - that is, the ice cream scoop - but to fit on more than one, the chainring bolt would need to be slightly narrower, which isn't practical, because chainring bolts are fairly universal. So, unfortunately, this was useless for me. But the chainguards were sturdy! ... not that it mattered."
5,Piranha Max 20 review,"With a limited budget, I shopped this one carefully, and the MAX 20 is the most bang-for-the buck I could find. The swivel base alone is worth the upgrade over the 10 or 15 models, and the better resolution only adds to an already great unit. Mounting directions were clear, and installation was done with common hand tools. The simulation setting allows you to see how it will work on the water. Never knew I what I was missing until I added a fishfinder to the old Lund. Highly recommended!"
3,Comic but slow,"Probably this book just wasn't my style, but I found it cheesy at best. I like humorous crime fiction and looked forward to making Dortmunder's acquaintance, only to discover this book really wasn't all that much about him, but spent more time dwelling on various FBI agents and bumbling policemen. I was hoping to follow Dortmunder through a series of escapades, but after the initial burglary, nothing much happened.However, the book was short and the writing style excellent. Westlake certainly has enormous talent. While I can't recommend you rush out and read this book, if you like Lawrence Block's humorous books, you might very well like Why Me."
3,Ideas for detecting failing businesses,"This book describes various ways of detecting deteriorating businesses from reading their financial statements and letters to shareholders. It also gives several examples from the early/mid 1980's. The book is fairly well written and easy to understand, provided you know accounting terms.The reason I have only given the book a mediocre rating is that parts of it are dated regarding accounting standards, and it is focused on discovering near-term financial problems for businesses but does not really discuss aspects of long-term investing and valuation.PS: This review is for the 1987 edition which appears to be identical to the 1998 edition."
4,Once more with Feeling,"Having discovered M. Cunningham through the novel The Hours, I was looking forward to Specimen Days. I was not disappointed. In each of the 3 stories in this novel, he celebrates life through the inspiring words of Walt Whitman. But each story finds its own way to appreciate the life we are given. Cunningham's sense of the tragic leaves me saddened at each turn. I found myself moved to tears at the end of this novel. My heart was heavy for the losses these characters experienced. What profound and powerful prose he puts on paper for us to ponder."
2,Disappointing and depressing,"I absolutely loved The Hours, and thought his other two books were good as well. So I was looking forward to getting this one. What a disappointment. While the writing is as good as ever, and the Whitman threads and the connections in time are interesting, the book is one big weight of doom and gloom and horror and sadness. While Hours also had depressing moments (which unfortunately the movie seemed to take as its prime MO), it also had moments of laugh out loud humor. There was none here. No humor, no human kindness, no hope. The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is that it is well written - well enough that I actually wanted to read the whole thing. Otherwise I'd not recommend it"
2,This is NOT The Hours,"Wow.What a weird and disappointing book!I LOVED The Hours- but this is on par with The Mermaid's Chair, in terms of its failure to measure up. TMChair is no ""Bees"" and THIS is no ""THours""!If you enjoy historical fiction AND SciFi, you will like the way Cunningham bridges the two genre; otherwise: forget it."
2,Unclear to me what the theme of this book is,"Specimen Days consists of three stories, with in each of them a woman, a man and a boy. The first story is located in New York at the time of the Industrial Revolution, when a young boy has to take the place of his older brother when the latter dies during an accident with the machine that he operates. In order to safe the girlfriend of his deceased brother he mutilates himself... The second stories plays in the present time and portays the life of a police woman who tries to prevent random violence from people with mental problems and who is more or less overwhelmed when all of a sudden children start committing suicide bombings... The third story is located in the future, when Earth has made contact with another civilization and a Nadian and a humanoid flee from theme park New York to go to Denver. It is unclear to me what the common theme of the book is and the stories were not overly interesting."
3,WHEW...hard work!,I have only gotten through the first of the three stories in this latest Michael Cunningham book. I love him and his style and incredible use of the language...but this time I am having to really WORK to keep from putting the book down. I will re-review AFTER I finally finish!
3,Engaging yet unsatisfying,"This was my first Michael Cunningham novel, so I didn't bring to it any preconceived notions of how it ought to be. And now that I've finished it, I am bewildered. Yes, it is absorbing, beautiful reading. But, like many of the readers here, I don't see the connection among the stories. (I notice that such a connection is alluded to in some of these reviews, but no one says of what it might consist.) Yes, there are the obvious elements of the names of the characters, Walt Whitman, and the luminous bowl, but there is no organic connection among the three parts: nothing about the characters, the plot, or the development of the story serves to bind it together. I don't see why these three stories should be part of the same novel, as opposed to their own separate entities. Although I could not stop reading -- mostly hoping for some such connection -- the writing is compelling for its own sake."
2,Am I missing something?,"I couldn't wait for this book to come out, I love all of his other books. I only got through half of it..I find it depressing, boring and just strange. I'm really disappointed!"
2,DID I MISS SOMETHING??,"I ADORE MC writings....so as soon as a book(before KINDLE) comes out, I am on line / online cause it's a journey you take with him.This book was so tedious for me to read, I may reread it and get a different perspective..overall not one of my favoritesYou know, I think I gave it away!!!..that's how much I did not like it..look in another bookcase????Cheers..Tony(NYC)"
2,Not at his best,"Michael Cunningham is such a fine writer that even when he is not that good, he is still above average. In ""Specmien Days"" he is above average and not much else. This is a rather disappointing piece of work. The novel is actually a trilogy of three smaller novellas. Unfortunately in this case the whole is less than the sum of the parts. The first part is in my opinion the superior one. The middle part reads like the screenplay of some generic police procedural TV drama. The final part, the most ambitious one almost descends into B grade science fiction. The writing remains first rate and Cunningham does succeed in transporting us into another space and time. But one gets lost in this space-time warp and the fleeting ghost of Whitman can do little to rescue us."
3,"Not nearly as compelling as ""The Hours""","And not nearly as connective either. When one finished ""The Hours,"" all of the pieces came logically together and unified the novel. While the pieces of this novel come together, it is not nearly as coherent as ""The Hours."" Not a complete waste of time - the first story is quite good, as is the second, but not the wonderful work that I hoped it would be."
5,Interesting Interconnected Stories,"I love Michael Cunningham, and this book (three distinct stories) is amazingly well written and is great for the overall story-telling that occurs throughout each piece."
5,"Lovers of literature, buy this book","Some years ago a friend handed me a copy of The Hours and said, ""I think you'll like this book."" What an understatement. Loved it. Love the writing--the carefully crafted, beautifully organized, lovingly offered prose of this writers' writer. And just this week, another friend handed me Specimen Days and said, ""Did you read The Hours? You would probably like this book...."" Again, profound understatement. Specimen Days has reminded me once again that we are utterly lost without art. It is the poets, the writers, the artists whose heightened sensitivity (to use Wordsworth description) and courage combine to show us the world as it is... and it is only in seeing the world through their eyes that we come to the awareness that something needs to change.... Specimen Days is a tremendous creative work. Bravo, Michael Cunningham, bravo."
2,2 stars but should be 1,"I'm sorry but I can't believe the hype for this novel. I wonder what I just read and can find no hidden meaning, joy, happy ending. It just doesn't work. I'm just thank ful that I got if from the library and didn't spend the money"
3,"An interesting experiment, not quite a success but worth reading","Three stories, using the same three characters, at three different moments in time / history: past (NYC, early 20th century); present; dystopian future. Walt Whitman is a connecting thread, as his holistic and organic perspective is juxtaposed against a world where industrialism and mass-ism are increasingly destructive to human life and spirit. It's an interesting idea, and makes for an interesting book, but not really a successful one. The plot-theme of a developing strain of child-warriors against industrialism is too big and complex to fit into this scale of basically psychological fiction, and each story requires so much plot-exposition that it's hard for the characters to coalesce and form as personalities. But it is a very worthwhile experiment, and worth reading, especially through Alan Cumming's great audio narration."
4,A wonderful surprise,"This is a novel that I would universally recommend to any thinking person. Period. Anyone who appreciates thought-provoking narrative should read this novel. While its woven nature seems more than a little forced at times, this minor flaw detracts very little from this intriguing and complex novel written by one of America's last living novelist intellectuals."
3,Not His Best,"While this novel is obviously well-written, it didn't really capture my attention like his first two novels did (A Home at the End of the World, Flesh and Blood).I remember reading an interview with the author saying how horrible it would be if he just kept writing the same novels with different characters in them. While I understand his concern, this novel seems a bit too much like his third novel, The Hours, to me at least.There were some things I liked about each story in this book, but each of them felt a little bit more impersonal than the other. I've heard that this is a direction this author wants to take with his writing. That's all good and jolly for him, but he might lose a few readers in the process.Ironically, this reminds me of one of his characters from The Hours. The guy who spent fifty pages describing a woman choosing a nail polish or something of that sort. Is this what the next Michael Cunningham novel will be like, I wonder?-Ater"
4,Always wanted to be a Knight,"Always wanted to be a Knight! Hail and well met, M'Lord! I never did play this game in the old formats so was really pleased to see it offered again for the GBA. It has good graphics and it requires some strategic thought. I must admit I'm not that great at jousting yet but will get the hang of it, after I raid a few more castles. If you like fantasy from the age of chivalry then I recommend this game. So go out into the lists, become unhorsed and you won't even have to scrub mud and rust from your armour!"
4,First Strategic Game,"Traditional Gamer - See game ""Golden Sun"" for more information. This game really makes the player think about strategy, a very rare item in any Gaming Boy Games. I personally enjoyed the game very much and highy recommended to any person who wants to take thier level of thinking to the next highest level. Beat the Game and I'll b e inpress. I will personal write the game company and tell them all the imporvements that they could make. But, seriously this game is a real challange. You don't get 4 stars from me for nothing!"
3,A light read on a serious subject,"Although this book can hardly be called original (most is reprinted articles), the material inside is well worth the recreational reading time of a software developer or manager. Most articles are light and informative, although the reader may be pressed to find application for the 'lessons' learned therein. Only one glaring bad spot in the book: a master's thesis is included that covers the Bank of America MasterNet failure. This 'thesis' is so poorly written and difficult to read, I question the value of the writer's degree. Otherwise, the book is firmly in the 'okay' category."
2,A few bright spots in an otherwise dull book,"...Most of this book consists of reprints of articles about particular runaway projects, including the Denver airport baggage handling system, the FAA's next-generation Air Traffic Control system (which replaced single keystrokes with 12 or more mouse clicks), and Bank of America's MasterNet. Some of this is interesting, but only some, and only somewhat; there is very little analysis, except in the introduction (which is worth reading)."
4,Good reading,"Although slightly short on analysis (you may want to check out Edward Yourdon's book ""Death March"" for that) this book presents a number of massive failures that made me think again about how large projects should be run and how lack of management, failure to communicate and plain politics can waste enormous amounts of money and lets profitable companies go bankrupt.It's not really a book about software engineering or large-scale project management but more a collection of anecdotal evidence."
5,Grear little hand book,This is a great little handbook for the beginner and someone who only uses oils on occasion. Keep with your oils in the barn. I was pleasantly surprised how detailed it was. Good buy
2,Not as much info as I'd like to have read. But it had interesting starts to aromatherapy.,"They shipped this bok fast, but I found it didn't have the info I was looking for in the book. The book is a good starting point."
3,"yeah, it's worth it","Hmmmmmm! I've seen both of these flicks and I never thought they'd be released in the same package. Personally, I like Reno 911 better, but if you like cop comedies, then this will give you a good kee-hee.Both have male nudity. Both have ensemble casts. I like the ""Cops"" TV series, and maybe both of these are designed for that audience. Then again, maybe both are meant to ridicule what goes on in that series.Again, one is stronger. However, I think this will make a great gift for those who want to laugh. I like cheeseburgers and I like fries, but I especially like the chance to eat cheeseburgers and fries. You might as well take advantage of this good opportunity."
1,Very little air movement,Suncourt DB204 Duct Booster 4 Dl 17551This fan moves very little air. I had to put a normal household fan in to get enough volume of air to vent my 6'x8' greenhouse.
4,duct fan,"I had a slightly unusual use for this fan. I wanted to transfer heat from the closet where my furnace resides to an adjacent room that has no central heat source. I used a 4 inch dryer vent hose to connect the two spaces. Initially I used the duct fan to ""push"" the warm air from the furnace closet to the room--not very effective. Very little air movement could be detected on the discharge end of the hose. I then placee the duct fan at the discharge end to ""pull"" the warm air from the furnace closet. This worked much better. However, I had hoped for a bit more air movement. All in all it seems worth the effort and the fan wasn't very expensive."
5,Excellent!!,"Uno de los grupos que recién descubro, me llevé una gran impresión, imperdible para los amantes de este género."
4,Love this item,"I bought this mattress topper in Jan 2005.... I have absolutely loved it. Beware that it is a little large for my mattress, about 2"" wider than I'd like, but other than that it has been a real pleasure. I was looking to purchase another, but unfortunately the price has doubled in the past 18mo! This was a fantastic deal over a year ago, but now I'm shocked at the price increase... and I'll have to keep looking."
3,"Good Book, Out of Date","This is a great taxidermy book. It covers almost everything you need to know about classic taxidermy. For that, I highly recommend this book.There are two things, however. The first is that this book is an exact reprint of the same book published in 1908. That makes this book over 100 years old, so the language is that old, as well (no big deal). Moreover, though, the chemicals used are that old. No one poisons animal skin with arsenic, anymore. Past that, though, this book will be just fine.The second thing is that these types of books can be downloaded for free on Google Books. Not this one exactly, but books just as detailed and similar to it."
4,THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD READ,I READ THIS BOOK IN ONE DAY. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. IT'S TOUGH STUFF BUT REAL. VERY WELL WRITTEN AND KEEPS YOU WONDERING WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.
1,Batteries will not hold a charge,Bought a pair of these batteries for my wife's an my phones and they would not last more than two days on standby. Talking on the phone with a charged battery would drain it in less than a half hour of it's charge. The original Nokia's (about $40 each) would last at least a week on standby and give several hours talk time. I can not recommend this battery.
4,Excellent,"Good album by one of my all time favorites. Not as strong as Life Itself or 3x though. Nothing has jumped out and grabbed my soul like any of the songs from those albums. Kind of disappointing in a way, but I will still listen to it and look forward to seeing Gooding in concert. ""For Love"" and ""Life Itself"" though are transcendent songs. Wishing for more depth. I think that's what he's best at."
2,Purchase did not go well!,"I did not receive anything from the service plan provider! When I enquired I was told that they would send out the extended service items ""within 2 weeks"". I received an E-mail from them requesting a favorable rating to you. I did not receive any items in the mail as promised! I tried to contact Amazon.com to complain with no success (Where are your customer service phone numbers?). I was finally able to reach the service plan vender and was told they would ""resend the service information, again""! I finally received a generic paper with their service information with NO mention of my purchase nor what they are supposed to be insuring. I AM NOT HAPPY! AND I WOULD LIKE A FULL REFUND of the price I paid!!! I do not need this kind of service and never will! My experience would suggest your customers should run not walk away from this vender."
2,Credit card option is a good one,I agree with the earlier review. If you haven't investigated the free extended warranties offered by many different credit card companies it is definitely worth your time. I find AMEX to be invaluable for large electronics purchases.
1,"Get the four year or nothing, I think nothing","Canon, at least has a one year part and labor, why would you pay for one more year. Most camcorders have little moving parts (they are tapeless) and unless you drop it (which is not covered) you should be good to go."
1,This book is all over the place,"Is it me or does this book have an exorbitant number of typos and blatant production errors? It reads more like a rough draft manuscript than a ready-for-publication book on podcasting. I was hoping it would offer solid advice on starting a podcasting business. It doesn't. It offers little, if any, real world advice to the would be podcaster. It is a book full of unorganized, run-on thoughts strung together with out-of-the-blue segues. The writing is needlessly repetitive and extremely hard to follow. I feel I am better off researching the business half of podcasting on the Internet than by extracting any information from this disjointed book."
3,On Video Podcasting Careeers,"This book brought me a great deal of information in an area I've known nothing about. As such, I found it quite valuable.Alma H. Bond, Ph.D. Author of 12 books, including Camille Claudel, a Novel."
5,Great Thoughts Made Accessible,"This book summarizes the conversations held between Harvard students and some of our most innovative thinkers. The students were asked to read and analyze works by these guest speakers and pose thoughtful questions to them. This relatively small book contains astute insights into politics, the economy, environmental issues, and human rights. It is written in precise, accessible language without over simplifying the concepts which are explained."
4,12 Pounds So Far...,Lipoxinol has wroked for me because I know I don't eat nearly as much and I have lost 12 pounds in only 3 weeks. That's enough for me to continue to use this product. I will give it 5 stars once i lose another 19 pounds. We'll see...
3,I highly recommend Lipoxinol,I am very skeptical to weight loss products. This one I was recommended by an extremely successful personal trainer so I decided to try it and I'm glad I did. I lost 34 pounds in time for summer. I am on my 4th order and hopefully I can maintain this weight loss I achieved.
2,No Go . . . Second Time Around!,"First time I ordered this product, it really seemed to work. Started losing weight and it controlled my hunger. Prehaps I was more motivated. This second time ordering this product, it doesn't seem to be working. I'm starting to believe that nothing will control my appetite. Sad. Won't be ordering this product again."
1,I would not purchase this again.,"I am well aware that there are no magic pills that magically burn off fat. I bought this product because I thought it was going to give me the energy I needed to make my exercise routines a little more productive; however, it didn't make a difference. I will not buy this again."
2,Probably worked for others but I didn't like the product.....,I read the reviews and I thought that the product sounded great. I had been on a weight loss plateau for months and I thought that this product would help me get thru the plateau. However when I took the product and followed directions I had so much anxiety and my nerves were a wreck! I tried to even lessen the dosage and it still didn't work. I don't doubt that it worked for others for I have tried other weight loss supplements that have worked for me but this one I didn't have a pleasant experience. Good luck to everyone else who are using it!
3,"Still haven't found the ""magic pill"" for weight loss...","I know, I know, I stopped believing in fairy tales a long time ago. However, every now and then I close my eyes and MAKE a wish... Anyway, I bought these and took them for about 3 weeks. They made me feel a little jittery and instead of that ""extra energy"", I found that I was feeling a little faint & shaky after my workouts. I also found that I felt a bit nauseous around 2pm and about 6 pm but I considered it a benefit, as it controlled my eating. But, alas after 3 weeks I found that I only lost 1 1/2 (1 and a half) pounds... Oh, well. At least I tried! I'm still exercising and wishing...for the next magical pill..."
2,Interesting,"After reviewing several top diet pills i thought this would be a good one. however, i read the same EXACT reviews that were posted on amazon on several other sites. Ok, so maybe these people really wanted to get the word out on this product... nope. There are no individual ""positive"" reviews here that i have not read, word for word, on another site, more specifically, driectly on Lipoxinol's site."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"My husband, my sister-in-law, and I have all tried this and it simply does not work. It was a total waste of money. It was like taking a sugar pill. All of the ""good reviews"" must have been employees of Web Nutrition. I just can't see how it worked on all those people and not on any of us. It was arip-off. I work out 4 to 5 times a week at the gym and I eat right. So, I will continue to try to lose weight this way."
3,It was highly recommended and so far so good,Too early yet to determine this product's long term effectiveness. I can however say that I have dropped weight and it came off easily too. I am very happy with the efficiency of placing an order throughh Amazon. I've ordered other stuff from Amazon and it's been high quality all the way around.
4,This is a great weight loss supplement,"Lipoxinol helped me shed weight in no time. I started using it 1 month ago and I look much slimmer. I don't use a scale to measure weight loss because muscle is heavier than fat. I can tell by the way my clothes are fitting me. I'm actually able to squeeze into my ""skinny jeans"" although thier still a bit too tight to wear, but I'm almost there!"
3,This stuff takes the cake,"I just ordered my first bottle of Lipoxinol with complete faith that this will have a dramatic effect on my metabolism like it did on my best friend she lost over 60 lbs, although I only need to lose 24 to get to an ideal weight just by her obstacle of losing weight I know my goal will be easily achieved."
2,bubblegum euro-dance,"Just a bunch of bubblegum euro-dance tracks. All the songs sound similar. One reason I buy these compilations is knowing most of the track will be mediocre, I will find a couple original, listenable tracks that point me to a new artist. I didn't find one here."
4,Lee Jean Skirt,"The skirt is nice, long with a slit in the back. Very comfortable to wear. Washes and dries nicely."
1,Boring.....Could not finish this book,"This is the first book in 10 years that I refused to finish reading. The dialoge was horrible. The storyline could have been good if the characters were believable. My curosity got the best of me so I read the last 2 chapters of the book to see if it got any better. A big fat no. Don't waste your time with this one. Ms Campbell's book ""Don't talk to strangers"" was much better."
4,Woooahh just hold on a moment there .... no English audio,Just thought I'd let everyone know that this title's audio format is Japanese language only with optional English subtitles. I find this disappointing as its rated at 7 years and up and children do not like reading subtitles !!! I've kept the rating at four stars so as not to change the overall rating so far on this title. The reviewer below says it all anyway.
4,DVD,If you can find this at a decent price it is well worth it. If you are looking for a romantic series with out the fan service this is it.
4,hits and hymns,"it is a lively collection to say the least. good gospel music. for the cost i paid, it is well worth listening to."
4,Finally! Fight the Huns again!,"I played this game on the Amiga when it first came out and loved it. The gameplay is story based and simple enough for anyone to manage. Even an absolute novice will still get many levels into the game but only the masters need apply to the deeper levels of the game...Mixing 1st person cockpit and 3rd person bombing runs, you fight your way through WW1 in a bi-plane. That darn GBA screen is the only drawback to this release. Hopefully, the screens will be bright enough to avoid the squint. If you like flight or want an action/adventure to keep you busy than get this game."
3,Still fun in GBA but not quite the same.,"Being an adult game player, I remember having a great time with Wings on the Amiga and was excited to finally see it available on a different platform. It's still fun but now that I'm playing it on the Nintendo DS lite, it's just not the same game. Of course, the screen is SO much smaller which is difficult, I think, as the game was originally created with a larger monitor view in mind. Something else that really bugs me is the elimination of the use of parachutes which is included in the original. Parachutes were brought in if you progressed far enough into the historical timeline of the game. Have not yet been able to face the Red Baron either which is a real bummer and, once again, a seeming deviation from the Amiga version.Wings is a fun game - even on the smaller platform and especially for those who never experienced it in its former glory. However,for me, someone who LOVED this game on the Amiga, this version just comes up lacking."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,I chose this book because of the reviews. There are a lot of names but there were also many that I did not know how to pronounce so that just lets me know I would have no business even choosing the name in the first place. I was looking for something different and this book offers that but again a pronounciation key would have been a great help. Currently I have only found 4 names (now that I know I am having a girl) that we are considering but we have not settled on any of them definitely. Now I have to try and find another baby book that hopefully will offer a pronunciation key.
4,Great but still can be better,We loved this book for what we used it for but there are more modern and fun books available too.
2,pain to go through,they have lots of names in this book yes they do most of them tho is different spellings of the same name and I really hate that a lot of females names are mixed in with the boy names it a bit of a pain togo through I perfer the best baby name book by this guy at lest boy and girl names ain't mixed altogether...besides it confused my fiance & his family so yea dont need to get a baby book that confuses my family...
1,DON'T BUY THIS.,"This is the worst book I've ever read.The whole book could have been summarized in 2 or 3 sentences...If you buy it, you'll regret it!"
4,does what it should,"Decent build quality, works for Dell PE2950 (as advertised). We used it to mount a PE2950 into a standard 2-post 19 inch relay rack."

1,Nice handles and that's about it.,"This rope was supposed to be made from leather, but it is unfortunately coated in black paint of sorts. The leather is totally stiff and needs a lot of conditioning. Otherwise, it is way too light and stiff to easy spin. Spend more and get a better leather rope if you like leather. I'm sticking with pvc for now even though it doesn't stay as rigid while spinning."
5,A Hot Texas Romance!,"The heat on Flint McCray's Texas ranch has little to do with the arrival of summer and a lot to do with the arrival of Jenna ""JJ"" Adams - his new horse trainer. The one he expected to be male.But Jenna is 100% certifiably female, and the chemistry between them is apparent from the instant they meet.Flint McCray's got enough on his plate right now, including a six-year-old son and an unknown enemy who seems determined to run his ranch into the ground. Is it possible the sassy woman is in cahoots with his enemy? Or is it more possible she's the perfect woman for him?Sparks fly between the rancher and the lady horse-trainer, and their passion ignites a fire hot enough to rival the Texas desert at noon in July. But not to worry. Flint's more than man enough to quench that fire.Kathie Denosky weaves a passionate tale of two strong people who find completion in each other. Her touches of humor and sizzling love scenes make this a must read."
3,Book 4,"Once more, Will Chambers is faced with a mystery set in the past, three hundred years to be exactly. To clear up a disputed legacy, he has to prove the innocence of a man accused of being one of Blackbeard's pirates. If he fails, a local good ol' boy/ godfather will take control of an island meant to go to a country pastor. The case is difficult, relying on ancient court records and interpretation. Complicating Will's life further, his beloved Fiona is pregnant, and wants to help him.*** The latest entry in a Christian's Perry Mason series is a bit slower than the first three. Fans of history will admire the research and detail that go into bringing past and present to equal life. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
1,Urban Junglist,"This is not the best Aphrodite cd. Too much rapping/ rasta BS. Used is an ok buy, but I would be dissapointed if I paid full price."
3,Good- Not His best,"Some good tracks, I'm partial to #4 with Skibadee. I still say that Takeover Bid is his best. If you're new to jungle, or you have heard parts of this cd, Check out that cd instead. The difference between that old blue cd and this one is continuity. That cd flows brilliantly from one track to the next without one dull moment, whereas in this cd the tracks seem more isolated and, in my opinion, has some subpar choices. But if you you already have that other one and can get this for only a few bucks, go for it."
5,When YOu Care Enough,Excellent book to learn more aobut the founding of Hallmark Cards. It is exactly what I was looking for.
2,pretzel bites,"I purchased them to use as part of a recipe. They were very hard, which made them very difficult to use or eat separately. I finally threw them away."
4,Works great for the price.,"Slides very easily. Works well even under non-ideal installation. The paint on the product was adequate. Clear grease was used to lubricate the bearings.I needed to support a 20 - 30 lb drawer that needed to extend 36"". I modified the stops on the 24"" full extension slide so that it would allow the slide to telescope in the opposite direction too. This works great! I get a 36"" full extension drawer (not common to find) using only a 24"" drawer slide (pretty common). I expect this to work well as long as I keep the drawer light weight."
1,Leaking Cap - Simple Correction,"The cap leaks due to ""Flashing"" from moulding was never removed to allow the ""Oring"" a smooth area to seal against. Correct the problem with an ""emery board"" from your finger nail care equipment,add a cup of water to jug then smooth the two ""Flash"" areas till a finger nail will not catch when drawn across the areas. Then screw on cap so the ""Oring"" is seated, turn the jug so the water covers the outlet,check for leak then if still leaking turn cap 1/4 turn tighter or looser to see if leak stops. If not go back and do some more smoothing till there is no leaking. Then add more water and swish it around to get the filings out of the jug. A final checkout can be made by having enough water in the jug to cover the cap area, screw the vent plug tight,then squeese the jugs sides to raise the pressure on the water so it will be closer to what a gallon of liquid wil exert when the jug is full."
1,Leaks,not a great design odd shape can't stand up by it self needs to lean on something. and it Leaks.. Get on at Kmart better quailty and price.
4,Good Neurological Sleuthing,"Toscanini's Fumble is a book of a dozen and a half case histories coming from the files of an eminent American neurologist, Harold Klawans. They are written in layman's language, with difficult words and concepts defined and explained. Even so, those in the medical field will find the stories far from juvenile and quite rich in detail, spiced with references to Klawans' favorite baseball players and musicians. Included in the collection are interesting historical vignettes, including one about the 3rd century Roman emperor Maximinus I. The title of the book comes from the chapter devoted to the neurological condition that caused famous symphony conductor Arturo Toscanini to drop his baton while leading the NBC Symphany Orchestra during a performance of Wagner in 1954. (He was never to conduct again.) I give this book a 9 on a 10 point scale. It was enjoyable reading and easy to follow."
5,Amazing book,"As someone who suffers from a chronic neurological condition, I super appreciated this book. He is thorough, delicate and incredibly smart.Alav hashalom."
1,difficult read,"I am a physician and while the stories of the patients were interesting, this book was difficult to read and would be above the heads of most readers. It also seemed that he was self promoting because several times he referred to a case that he explained in another book. I would not buy this book again."
1,You will regret it!,Rust comes out every time. Contacted manufacturer and they blamed alcohol in hand soap. Hand soap didn't contain any. More fake cheap Chinese stainless steel.
2,Lovely bottle but pump rusted,"Like the previous reviewer's pump, the pump on this dispenser rusted after about a week and turned my soap an ugly brown. Fortunately, I had a pump from another dispenser that I wasn't using that fit into this. I'm giving this soap dispenser 2 stars, rather than 1, because the bottle is pretty and I was unable to find this shade of blue at a similar price point elsewhere. But if you buy this, be prepared to switch out the pump."
5,A must read guide for CEOs,This is one of the most powerful and inspiring book on leadership. It must be a required reading for MBA students and senior executives.
5,A Great Leadership Book to read,"Organizations need leaders, but natural leaders are at least as rare as natural athletes. And, even natural athletes need careful training and development - given that almost everyone is capable of developing some degree of athletic potential. Similarly, the right training and development program can help almost anyone cultivate some degree of leadership potential. In fact, it can help a few people develop extraordinary leadership abilities. Ignoring leadership development is foolish, but at many companies, short-term priorities eclipse the long-term thinking needed to develop a good leadership pipeline. This book's plain, sensible approach is simple without being simplistic. It is generally lucid and clear, and - somewhat to my surprise - it does not suffer from having five authors. If you are a leader or need to develop leaders for large corporations, this is a very useful volume."
5,Very solid,"Cool book! Looks at all sorts of issues for today's channel strategist. The authors really hammer home the theme that your channel strategy must be about your customers and how they want to do business, which is often overlooked. There are just a bare minimum of silly buzzwords, and the authors have written a serious book with lots of detailed (and thankfully relevant) examples, case studies, and concise, actionable ideas."
4,"Evolving a "" Go to Market Strategy""","The Channel Advantage addresses the issue of ""how to sell"" effectively through a portfolio of sales channels.The book helps practising marketing professionals to evolve an effective go to market strategy. A strategy that effectively uses multiple sales channels- the conventional ones like the direct sales force, Value Added Resellers(VARS)as well as new channels like the internet and call centers.The book provides an overview of how to work with multiple channels but does not cover any one type of channel in great detail. This tends to be a little unsettling for the practising professional. However this is understandable taking into account the vast nature of the topics being covered.Overall a good book and gives a good insight into how to reach more customers, sell more products and make more profit."
4,Practical and Tactical,"Today it is just as important to put effort and creativity into how you go to market as into what you bring to market. Each sales channel has its own strengths and its own limitations. For example, sales forces can handle complex transactions and provide a high quality of customer service, but they're expensive. On the other hand, the internet is very inexpensive, but you will be limited to the sale of simple, low-cost products. The trick is to have a variety of sales channels appropriate to the products, to reach the most diverse group of customers and deliver the right product at the lowest cost. The authors have provided three steps to building a world-class sales channel system.1. Know which channels you should be using.2. Know how to build those channels into world-class performers.3. Manage them together as an integrated go-to-market system."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Friedman goes right to it. Use the Internet! Don't just use one channel! Multiple channels reach multiple consumers! More customers means more sales! More Sales means more revenue! I'm not entirely convinced Friedman should have said profit--I think the recent stock market problems proves that revenue and profit are two different things. Or not, depending on your auditor.I used this with Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired for one reason. Friedman knows how to use the Internet, but Levine's book also has plenty of useful stuff. Why limit yourself?I think what separates this from other multiple channel advocates is Friedman's unabashed enthusiasm. It's rather contagious, and I found myself smiling more and more. It's nice to smile when reading a business book."
3,Solar charger,Way too small to charge the battery. Next time I willget at least the 16 Watt one instead of the 2 watt
2,uh oh,"We had a van that we had to jump start every time we left it a few weeks in-between uses. We put this charger on it, waited a few weeks, and had to jump start it."
2,It is too small.,"It fits to my Weber Q 100 well. However,it is really small. You can't even puta plate on it. You shouldn't speed 20bucks to get it."
4,Must have for your Q,"You need these for your Q, only reason not a 5star is because they are a little flimsy but do the job."
2,Semi satisfied,"I love Dodgeball it works perfect and is a great movie but I was in the impression that I ordered Dodge Ball and Me, Myself, and Irene so because of the fact that I received The Rocker instead I can't give this dvd combo a full 5 star rating."
1,DON'T BUY THIS COLLAR!,"Please do not waste your money on this collar. It is so poorly constructed that I had to throw it away after less than a week. Whenever the cat scratches his neck, the collar starts to fray and the cat ends up with long purple threads down his back. The threads also get caught in the cat's lower teeth when he's cleaning himself.In addition, the breakaway part is extremely difficult to break away. I doubt the weight of my four pound cat would do it, even if he was swinging from a tree branch by his neck."
3,Failed after 6 months continuous use,This unit failed after 6 months of 24x7 continuous use. It did not produce any static when plugged-in as another reviewer had experienced.
1,Cannot play while charging,"I cannot play my MP3 player while it is charging. There is too much static. I use the AUX jack on my radio, so I'm not sure why there is interference coming through the power adapter."
5,Great portable USB power!,"This little USB hub needs to be in your glove compartment. It will power any USB device so iPods, iPhones, etc can be charged (or used!) while on the go. The quality is excellent, it's well designed, it's priced right. Highly recommended!"
4,Just what I needed,"If you have a USB device that needs charging, this is the unit you need. I have two different MP3 players. Both come with USB plugs to transfer MP3 files and for charging. That same cable can be used with this unit. Great solution."
4,Fun rally game,"As a huge fan of rally games, I had to add this to my library. This game offers nice graphics, great control, and a HUGE amount of tracks. There are at least 18 or more countries to race through, and for a rally game that is a lot. The best part about this game is how fast it runs. Ive never played a rally game that you could drive so fast in (an fly off the side of a cliff if your not careful). Also, incredible replays with good music are optional to watch after you race, best replays ive ever seen in a game, by far. I highly reccomend for rally game fans."
2,I expected A LOT more,"I'm very disapointed. Sure the graphics are amazing, but there's just too much low points in this game to get a decent score.1. You can drive as reckless as you want. Your car will be fine for the next stage.2. Setup of the car is way to basic. We're all used to the CMR series, Rally Masters and Rally Championship, where setup is essential.3. It's just way to easy to complete. Drive the Accent or the Octavia for a half-decent challenge.4. They have everyone listed, except Colin McRae. Why is he listed as ""Ford Driver"" and doesn't score any points?? Unfair I tell ya!!I can't wait for CMR3."
4,Great for WRC fans,"I've been an avid fan of the WRC for years (even went out and bought a Subaru WRX car) and this game is a blast. It's so true to the TV show that, if you're a fan, you should get it just for that. Graphics are very good, the replay mode with multiple views is just like TV, and gameplay is decent. To sum up:Pros:- Graphics- Accuracy to real WRC coverage- decent (but not great) gameplayCons:- Takes forever to load a new stage- A little too easy to win in normal mode (more fun to race against friends in Time Trial mode- If you sky off a cliff, you just get a 3-second penalty and no damage (not too realistic)- Co-driver calls are often too late and sometimes inaccurateIf I weren't a huge WRC fan, I probably would've given this game three stars, but it gets 4 from this racing fanatic."
2,Pretty poor game for a PS2,"I bought this game and shortly afterwards sold it. Don't waste your time buying it. I'd wait for Collin McRae 3 or something else. The graphics are very poor for PS2. Detail is low, car detail is horrible, as is the scenery and off road textures.The car's handle OK but not as realistic as Collin McRae 2 on the PS1. I was most disapointed by the steering wheel support. It works, but it doesn't take advantage of the force feedback. It just vibrates with no apparent notion of the car dynamics - also, you keep having to use the PS2 controller to navigate the menu options. I hope the other upcoming rally games have better feedback in this respect."
3,HORRIBLE experience,"First of all, I watch a lot of WRC racing, I'm a big fan. The game has its high-points: realistic sound, official licensing, and plenty of tracks. But the cars handle COMPLETELY unrealistically. To give you an idea, I brought the car to a complete stop, but my car still mysteriously floated a few inches in whichever direction. Even on asphalt! The car powerslides with the gentlest turn of the wheel! I'm not just a bad driver (No one in my neighborhood can beat me at the Gran Turismo series), the cars just handle horribly. While the cars sounded GREAT (I could hear the signature Peugeot exhaust note), the skidding sounded just harsh and awful, nothing like real skidmarks, and it made the entire driving experience painful. This game has its high points, but its lows drop below sea level, and I'm regretting having bought this game."
4,Solid Entertaining Rally Game,"WRC is the best rally game I have played. The video segments are cool. There are many rallies, 5 stages pre rally. Some rallies are tough some aren't so, but the tracks can be a lot more realistic than in most games. In some places the track is barely wider than the car, unlike many other games. Physics are fair. Crash physics are pretty bad and can be a little frustrating when you try to save the car when on two wheels. The game does at least have a damage engine and it is adequate. Sector times can be a little funny sometimes (+8sec one sector, -8sec the next).With those complaints said, I would have no reservations about buying the game again and again. It is a fun game and exponentially more realistic than anything else I've seen. Perfect, no, but still very good. Not to mention at a used price, I love it."
5,great game,"great physics! try using the steering wheel you'll see how realistic it is,it add's to the intensity even more."
1,THE WORST,This doesn't even worth a star.Just like lemans 24 hr. a game developer trying to hustle a quick buck. Don't touch this.Andre
5,Cute and functional,"The headcover fits perfectly on my 460 cc driver, and gets plenty of compliments on appearance. I can even pick it up without bending over by sticking the head into the opening while it's on the ground... that's always a plus!"
5,My daughter's favorite toy,We are huge fans of Schleitch and the quality of the small animals is fantastic. This toy has become a staple for my daughter.
2,Paper Mate,"This is not as advertised. This is a single mechanical pencil, not a 4 assorted color set. Very disappointed, the cost is too much for one pencil. Feel like I've been taken."
3,Smoke on the Water,"This is the official ""Beat The Boots"" version of the infamous concert at the Casino in Montreux, Switzerland, which ended in a fire that destroyed The Mothers' equipment, later immortalized by Deep Purple in their song ""Smoke on the Water.""I have the BTBs vinyl version,a two record set that presents a nearly complete live performance by the 1970-71 ""Flo & Eddie"" edition of The Mothers, featuring lead vocalists Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, and probably Ansley Dunbar, Don Preston,Ian Underwood and Jim Pons. Recorded December 4, 1971,it begins with an extended instrumental introduction leading into ""Peaches En Regalia,"" and then there is a combination of 200 Motels material and oldies like ""Call Any Vegetable."" Sound quality is good, for a bootleg and the performance level is high."
4,A Piece of Musical History,"Not only is it a recording of the fire at the Montreux arena, it has the complete Sofa Suite. Aside from the audio quality, (the vocals sound hollow and tinny and the P.A. system eats it at the end of Peaches En Regalia), this album is a prize in my Zappa collection.The surprising improvisations by Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, the humor, the ethos, the pathos, the Porthos, the Aramis,the Brut Cologne. But I digress...Great album."
2,Not as it appears,"I was very disappointed when this costume arrived. As it is pictured, the dress looks like it should hit the tops of the feet, but it barely came past my daughter's knees, and she is a very petite 10 year old. I ordered the size 8/10. The top of the dress was also HUGE around the chest and shoulders area, not cute and fitted as pictured. She was not happy that she had to wear a shirt underneath for modesty's sake. The collar was also too big and very awkward - wouldn't stay in place and the velcro to hold it on was badly placed. She chose to go without it. Overall, we were both disappointed with this costume. Would not recommend it."
2,Disappointing Quality,"The sound is good for the price. My rating is low because the CD door is a finiky beast. After three months of regular use in a household of adults, the open button on the top (not an obvious placement given the location of other controls) stopped working properly and the door to the CD compartment no longer closes. The radio tuner is still working properly, but I would have spent less if all I wanted was a radio.This is disappointing quality from a company from which I have bought several reliable lower end audio products for many years."
2,Great if you aren't an audiophile,"The speakers are terrible and there is no equalizer (not needed if you keep the terrible speakers). I hooked up different low watt speakers to it and it sounds fairly decent. I would suggest looking at other stereos of the same ilk like the ""Emerson 25W Micro System with Subwoofer and Flat-Panel Speakers"" or ""Insignia Stereo Bookshelf System with CD/MP3 Playback and AM/FM Tuner"" both of these come with a subwoofer."
1,not very durable,This toy is a great idea but just is not very well made. This pieces break very easily when being hammered and the nails are very tiny and difficult for tiny fingers to handle. The only thing that gets five stars is the concept!
5,"Open ended, fine motor fun","My 2.5 year old loves this. She loves the small parts, loves to make designs, loves to hammer the little nails.Tricky part: the box doesn't work well as a container for the small parts--they get stuck and fall out and such. We added little boxes to hold the small stuff inside."
4,Definitely needs parent supervision.,"Great product and perfect for my 3 year old developmentally. The ""nails"" are very small so this is not something I'd let him do without me involved. Also, I thought the cork board would be bigger. Overall we really like it though."
5,FORGOTTEN?,"All to often the sound Chicago gets overlooked. People get so wrapped up in Motown, Stax-Volt and the later ""Sound Of Philadelphia"" they either forget or simply don't know about the huge impact Chicago has had on R&B.;This book is loaded with facts but also a terrific read.As one of the city's most famous sons wrote:""Why don't you check out your mind"""
3,"Interesting, but only when you know the music","This book is one of the best on soul music in Chicago, told in chapters according to record labels. You get to know about Gene Chandler, Major Lance etc. A running story throughout the book is the amazing career of Curtis Mayfield. With the Impressions, as a writer and as a producer.Unfortunately when the author discusses an artist he names many singles, albums and songs and if you don't know them it is sometimes hard to read between those names to get the real story. You need to at least know most of the artist to make it worthwhile"
3,"Interesting Life, Still Mysterious","I was thinking about writing this review about halfway through the book, but felt bad about my thoughts towards the end of the book, since my main issue with this biography was what the author strived most to accomplish. Lee Miller led a fascinating life, and Carolyn Burke obviously enjoyed writing about it. But I realized that I never felt like I KNEW Miller, only was following her life. I was aware of what she was doing at each stage of her life, but not necessarily what drove her to do so, or what was going through her mind. I know Burke wanted to look at Lee Miller's life through Lee Miller's eyes, but I never felt that I had that perspective.I would have loved to see more of the photographs too that Burke described. Those included in the book were wonderful to look at, and there were plenty, but I was hoping to see even more.I am grateful though that Burke did bring such a fascinating person to light."
4,great close shave,The lift and cut system by norelco is above all other electric razors. Great return policy if you are not satistied.
4,Ol' relibale,"I've been using it for 5 years and doubt that it is manufactured any longer. It works great shaving face and head. Need to recharge every week since I am shaving head (was 2-3 weeks for face alone). The only draw back that there is not charge level indicator. Battery drops dead on you in the middle of the shave, but you can charge it for few minutes and complete face job."
1,break away,"the razor seems fine however, the cutting head breaks apart.while opening the cutting head it comes off the razor. Do Isend it back or can it be put back together somehow?"
5,awesome bag,"This bag is made with really good quality material and has lots of features: divided sections, pockets, and overall cool doohickeys. There's padding to make it comfortable when carried. It fits a lot of equipment. I would highly recommend this batbag to anyone."
4,The Wanderers include a Wolfhound named Seamus,"The Wanderers takes place when Ireland was in the midst of the Pagans and the Christians vying for power. The story concerns Father Ambrosius, also known as the Wanderer, who has rescued two boys, one from a demon and the other from Viking raiders and he rescues an Irish Wolfhound named Seamus.I collect books that feature Irish wolfhounds in the story, so one never knows what you'll find when you read the book. The book, written in 1972, is out of print. It is religious in nature, but for the not-so-religious, there is a lot of action along with love and redemption. The story is not preachy and events are told in a rather straight forward, matter-of-fact tone leaving the reader to draw their own conclusions.The wolfhound, Seamus, is integral to the story and embodies the best characteristics of this noble dog! Like I said, I collect books on Wolfhounds--so this is an excellent addition to your Wolfhound library!"
1,"Run Forrest, run!","I bought this game at the store. I'm not at all impressed with it. I was expecting a realistic game like Bushido Blade, but with a good plot. It ain't. The game is anachronistic and you do a lot of ""hack, hack, slash...hack hack slash"". I still play it but only to finish it. The save system is screwy. I lost my game for some unknown reason. This game ain't Tenchu, it ain't Bushido Blade. There is no feeling like a Samurai. They might as well have made this a 2D scrolling action game. The best thing about this game is the intro...and it don't get any better after that. I wish I could have rented the game. I won't even give this game away cuz I might lose a friend."
1,Ulti Gamer,"This was a very disapointing game. I bought it after reading the reviews on line and I must say that I was thouroughly disapointed. I totally wasted my money. First off, the players move way too slow, and you are limted with only a few moves. I kept playing hoping that it would be better, but gave up after a couple of days out of bordom. I would compare the gameplay, fun rating and overall playability to that between atari and the first nintendo. Don't waste your money. It just goes to show you that some of these reviews are illegitimate."
2,Horrible game save design,"Just imagine that you have spent hours playing this game and your dog comes walking by your PS2 console and pulls the plug from the wall. No problem right? WRONG! You will have to start from the begining of the game. You lose all of your game data because this game allows you to only load the data one time! So if you can't make it to a save point while playing (which there are very few)or you reset your PS2 by accident, you have to go through everything all over again. In all fairness it would have been a great game if it wasn't for that small detail. Depending upon the decisions you make, you can determine the outcome of the game which is pretty cool. I should also mention that the game has also frozen up on me a few times and of course, I had to start ALL over again. A good idea for a game but just not playable. Save your money, maybe the game developers will get the message."
1,a 76 year old gamer,"Based on the screenshots I've seen of this game, the graphics look very PS1-like, so don't expect anything groundbreaking in the category."
4,Great Sword Slashing Game!!!,"This game is really good. I got it for christmas and 'been playing ever since. It's got O.K graphics and gameplay. The best thing is fighting. At the start you create yor player (you unlock more and more accesories as you play the game). There are six different endings, which means the games are pretty short. There are lots of differnt kinds of swords. It has also got 2 player fighting (you unlock it as you play).Overall, this game is good when it comes to fighting.Jolly"
1,"I never played it, never will..","From so many reviews, they suggest highly for this game and give it a 5 star rateing. I trust in the bad reviews, why write a bad review if it is'nt honestly true. I usually would rent it and write my own pearsonal review on the game but not this time. Theres alot of samurai, ninja, and whatever else there is in a name for martiel arts games comeing out. I'll wait for Onimusha 2, Shinobi and many others that seem to have boggled my expectations. This ""Way Of The Samurai"" tends to lack alot for me just from reviews, images and personal recomendations that suggest, don't bother. Don't waist your money, save it for a future release. I give this game 1 star for attempting to scam me, and I give BAM! $0.00 of my money for there badly designed game."
5,Kicking game!,"This is a combination of almost 5 different games. It is sort of billed as a dramatic RPG for serious gamers. Not quite. It is more a lighthearted game for action fans/casual RPG gamers. It has a fight style similar to Dynasty Warriors. A do-what-you-feel-like storyline like Grand Theft Auto. Swords that give you different moves and power similar to an RPG. And it has a HUGE tone to it that reminds me of those books where you could choose the storyline at the end of each chapter. Great game, but not for everyone. The only drawback is that its somewhat short, but it has so many paths to the end (as well as different endings) that is stays fresh and fun. No one game plays out the same."
4,When genius is bottled like Kandor,"Thank the gods that Moore did not write many DC superhero stories. The DC universe is too limiting. These are all excellent stories (particularly the concepts), but the mind of Alan Moore is in a straightjacket. It's a little like watching a great pianist doing five-finger exercises: interesting and enjoyable, but not really what you want. By all means buy this book to complete your Moore collection, but buy his ABC work (especially the brilliant ""Promethea"") first."
3,Excellent writer,"I always look forward to Judith Warner's Friday columns in the New York Times. Because she often makes me laugh, even wryly, I had expected more humor in this book. However, it is a rather serious treatise on the status of women in our society. I recommend it for anyone concerned about those issues or who has interest in how we compare to France. Well-written, thorough reporting."
2,If someone is having this much of a problem...,"...with their life choices, they really need to look within themselves (and possibly to a professional therapist) for answers.Our society, culture, and politics are what they are; we all live and work within the same framework. Yes, adjusting to parenthood is difficult but people have been doing it for quite a few generations in this country and somehow they've all managed. One can choose to feel guilty and anxious day in and day out, or one can choose to feel grateful and joyful at the fullness of one's life. Lamenting that Europeans do it better is neither here nor there and is not helpful to the average American woman.Soul-searching and taking responsibility for what your life looks like is what will help women, not wishful thinking. All we can control are the choices we make, regardless of what the growing pains of the post-feminist era in this country may be."
1,useless info,I was expecting some kind of insight instead got all those background/history reports of women's role in society. The author stayin in France for a couple of year made her think she qualified to judge/report. The whole book is piled up useless statistics and old info.
2,just not that good and/or helpful,"I was hoping for some good anecdotes, science or SOMETHING, but really it was just a lot of whining. Also i feel like i was reading the same thing over and over again, just in a different chapter. There was a tiny little section on mommies who take meth (to get everything done); now, a whole chapter on THAT would have made me (only ""addicted"" to espresso) feel like I'm doing pretty well in comparison!"
2,Rehashes same woe chapter after chapter,"I don't doubt that mothers in the US often get a raw deal. No mandatory paid maternity leave, check. Antiquated expectations of new mothers in the workforce, check.But after awhile the litany of ""madness"" that surrounds some of the women seems helplessly self-imposed. Don't spend two months pay on a birthday party, if it's so maddening to do so! Husbands are also portrayed as clueless jerks who would chew off their own hand before doing laundry.The book started to have some moments, but it relied too heavily on a small group of women who need to take some initiative in their lives. There's a lot of fodder for the pathetic deal women and mothers get in this country, but it doesn't come through here."
3,Got bored at times,"This book does cover a lot of interesting ideas on parenting, although I got a little bored with reading it. I have read over 1/2 of the book and am not totally into it. I am skimming it right now. Being a SAHM to 3 1/2 yr old twins, I do relate on some levels, but don't believe it all. In my opinion, this is not a page-turner book as I wished it would have been."
3,Additional reading,"Why didn't Anna Fels' ""Necessary Dreams: Ambition in Women's Changing Lives"" get the recognition and media attention that this book has (unless I missed it)? Warner brings up relevant points and understandable frustrations, but if you would like to read a book which truly explores the significant cultural, societal and personal obstacles faced by women in work and motherhood, pick up ""Necessary Dreams."" Anna Fels' insight teaches, saddens and motivates in ways which I think Warner's book does not."
1,Wealthy Whiners Unite!,"What a sad statement about the state of preppy culture. Of course, none of it is their fault. The pressure is too much. This book is a manifesto alright, about how wealthy American women are wimps. The pressures being, as Ms. Warner told Salon, ""how many sleepovers should my daughter have in one week? As Colonol Kurtz said, ""The Horror, the Horror."" Which is an appropraite quote to use when faced with people who have everything finding a way to whine about it. You live in Eden Ms. Warner. Figure that out. Get over yourself."
1,Get a GRIP!,"I saw this author on Nightline last night. Wah, wah, wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. No you can't have it all, duh! Being a mother is a huge sacrifice and she has obviously bought into the line that you can have it all, as most of the women from my generation have. Don't waste your money on this drivel."
1,same-o same-o,"Do we really need ANOTHER book coaching/counseling/reassuring women how to get what tons of men have had for years...a career AND a family. I don't see any chapters with the title ""how to get your husband to do his share"". I suggest her next book should be ""How to find a man who will be a real partner""...that would take care of a great deal of all this handwringing..."
1,Piece of self-indulgent screed,"Can women please grow up and stop blaming America for their personal choices? (And choosing Friedan as a role model is lame in the 21st century, but sure is convenient if you have no ideas of your own). I'm well over 40. If you are looking for a way to take control of your own life and not wait for some man to pass a law doing that for you, take a big pass on this one.PS - I would not have given it even one ""star"" but Amazon insisted I give it at least one. This is not a guide for the 21st Century woman."
2,"This is a history book, not a ""study"" of current parenting issues","I ordered this book thinking I was going to share the experiences of the 20-40 year old current mothers that the author supposedly interviewed extensively and reported upon. Instead what I found was a nearly unreadable and repetitive history of how we got where the author thinks we are now. Every chapter repeated the previous one, with a few changes in wording. Yes, we know women have not been equals in the past. I was hoping to hear more about how current moms deal with issues, not how our mothers were treated in the past. I was extremely disappointed and will not be reading Judith Warner again."
4,How scary!,"After reading the ""Perfect Madness. Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety"" I was honestly wondering why any woman would ever chose to have a child. Maybe Judith Warner just painted a very grim picture, but according to her book it doesn't sound as if there is much to be gained from motherhood. She made it sound like all sacrifice and no play. The ideal of an egalitarian marriage in which all the child rearing and household duties are equally shared seems to be a myth. Apparently mothers still get stuck with the most chores and on top of that mothers of today raised the pressure by striving for insanely perfect standards. What happened to feminism? And why aren't more women really upset about this?"
3,Could be better,"Judith Warner's book does a great job of reporting on the current perfect parenting craze but offers few realistic solutions to the problems she outlines. At the root of her augment is that mothers today are not activists for themselves and are instead behaving just as our mothers did by suffering in silence. The problem is, she neglects to address all the stay-at-home moms out there who are not going insane but rather happily driving their kids to every extra class they can find in the area. This book is best when Warner lets her sense of humor come through, and worst when her bitterness wins out. Personally, I think The Perfect Parents Handbook, a humor book on today's over parenting movement is a healthier read on the subject. Laughing at how crazy the parenting world has become and our role in this trend seems like a better solution than trying to stop a problem that, in the end, is just human nature."
2,"Excuses, excuses","Shame on you Ms. Warner. I as a mother, of course, feel overwhelmed with the new-age mom pressures out there. But I rise to them, embrace them, and am completely fulfilled by being a mom. Maybe next time, you could write about a few of the joys??"
5,A visually rich read!,"This is one of the most visual reads I have come across in a long time. Lane von Herzen truly creates a tapestry of language that conjures up a visually resplendent world that you will find yourself wanting to be an inhabitant of. The characters are so richly created you feel that you personally know them - and wish that you did. Ms. von Herzen combines the physical and mystical worlds seamlessly into a story of what it means to be human - love, desire, compassion and yes, even the misunderstandings we can and do have with one another. You won't want to put this book down and will be sad to say goodbye to this richly painted world when the book comes to an end."
4,I was a teenage professional wrestler,"I thought that the book was okay considering it took place a long time ago. When I first picked up the book, I thought that it was a book on present day wrestling. When I found out that it was a book on wrestling a long time ago, I was kind of angry, but once I started reading it, I ended up liking it."
5,It's big and it's terrible!,"Sorry, I couldn't resist using Raymond Burr's awful line. But this soundtrack is indeed truly AWESOME! One of the best things about Godzilla is the music, which was so distinctive and so haunting that it made us overlook the cheesy special effects. More than any of his 1950's monster contemporaries, Godzilla's soundtrack gave the big guy a soul that spooked children and stayed with them long after they grew up into sensible adults. I still get chills whenever I hear those school girls singing the Prayer for Peace. Akira Ifukube was a genius whose music was an apt coronation for the King of the Monsters!"
5,One of the most emotional Godzilla soundtracks you can find,"This soundtrack can be very emotional to every fan,especially big fans. I believe that Akira Ifukube was a musical genius to compose the way he did for this, and every other Godzilla movie he composed. The tracks on this disc sound just like they do in the film, if they've been changed at all, I can't tell. Some tracks really stand out for me. I recomend this soundtrack for all fans."
5,SIMPLY AWESOME,"Being a Godzilla fan I love this CD. It reminds me of all the good times; Godzilla eating boats, trains, buildings, people: you know, all the good Godzilla stuff! The sound quality is just fine; it IS the real recordings and no ""digital mastering"" can improve upon it.Buy this CD and relive the good times!"
3,Haunting but Dated,"The soundtrack to the original Gojira (Godzilla) stands up well against many modern film scores. The mix of themes, use of melody, and general structure & mood of the music evoke the movie well. There's a reason that some of these themes remain staples of Godzilla movies some 50 years later.However, the recording techniques of the 1950s severely hamper playback today. The music is hollow, and often tinny in places. This is certainly not high-fidelity, stereo, quadraphonic, etc. The recording is dated, and sounds it."
3,Nothing I didn't already know...,"This book is probably a good read for something newly diagnosed with MS. I was diagnosed 9 years ago and have learned a lot of these ""tips"" on my own. I'm glad I bought it ""used""."
2,Not very good,I wanted this book for years and when I finally got it to my great dissapointment it wasn't that good.Most of the parts were boring.I think the ending is dumb.Mallory is one of my favorite babytsitters but this is one of her not-so-good books.(...)
2,Mallory is F-A-K-I-N-G,Mallory is just faking she thinks she's sick.Her brothers and sisters are making her get better.
3,"Good start, simplistic but gets you started","There have been some people who have said that this book is too simplistic, and that it has misinformation. That can be true, but this book is a very simple start for beer. Let's face it, the vast majority of beer drinkers aren't brewmasters, or don't know the difference between dry hopping and beechwood aging. For those of you who really want to get started, and learn a little about beer and various points of interest in the beer world. The best part of the book, in my opinion, is the write-ups of famous or notable beers, from Yuengling, America's Oldest Brewery, to Anheuser Busch, Americas Largest. This book lays out a beginners plan to whet their appetite. More advanced beer lovers move on."
3,The Everything Beer Book,"As an avid skier and mountaineer, I do considerable domestic and international travel and drink my fair share of beer in the process. And, I always try to bring a few longnecks back as souveneirs for my pals.Last year, a friend gave me The Everything Beer Book for my birthday and I was surprised with the wealth of information it provided. As a novice beer drinker with an appreciation for the work that goes into it, I liked the subjects and reability of this book.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a basic understanding of the history and mechanics of beermaking and beer drinking. I even gave it as a present to my brother's father-in-law, a self-brewer in New Orleans.That's all."
4,Packed full of interesting beer facts and history.,The everything beer book is fun reading. I found the history section to be most interesting. Who would have thought that the Egyptians were beer drinkers.
1,CAUTION: THE CD PICTURED ON THIS PRODUCT PAGE HAS 12 TRACKS!!!,"Hello There:I LOVE Ultra Lounge CDs. The Leopard Cover has the Best Lounge Music I have ever heard (and I have quite a few from various labels), But the CD pictured is Different from the Track Listing. So ASK THE SELLER which CD they have for sale!The Amazon system sometimes copies reviews to multiple pages. So if this isn't true where you see it. Just disregard this message."
1,Warning!,"Please, dear music fan, don't meddle with it! Love Beach is just a very poor impression from former albums by E,L&P. It's not pure E,L&P you may think.This album is good for nothing, believe me. I would ram it! Look for other and better records by E,L&P, there are still a lot of. But not this and that's the end of that! I can't give nought stars but I would. With pleasure!"
3,That last review was more than a bit extreme,"While it's true that ""Love Beach"" was the result of Emerson, Lake & Palmer simply going through the motions to fulfill contractual obligations, they are such phenomenal musical forces that even their worst work contains a gem or two. On ""Love Beach,"" the beautiful ""Love at First Sight"" from ""Memoirs of an Officer and a Gentleman"" alone makes the album worth the purchase. ""Canario"" is also a delight. Maybe these two tracks are about it for ""Love Beach,"" but if you miss them, you're missing a lot."
5,PERFECT For Floating Dollar Trick!,"This is perfect to float anything light. Nobody sees the thread, depending on the lighting. When the thread breaks, its simple to fix, you just gotta suck on the hole that the thread comes out of, and a little piece will pop out, in which then you take and attatch it to the wax ball! SIMPLE! I reccomend this item, dont go by the other reviews, nobody else knows how to fix it."
2,strong thread weak reel,"The reel rewind is weak and based on twisting elastic thread. Although there is a lot of thread on the reel, the retracting elastic gets too tight and breaks when about 6 feet of thread is extended.Additionally, the thread on my reel had taken on the curve of the reel, instead of lying flat. I expect that the thread is twisted as it is placed on the device, causing this flaw. This caused it to have a curvy wave like very curly hair. The result was that the I.T. was more obviously reflecting every light source than if it was strait. I tried to use the I.T. on another reel, but it kept coming off, due to the curliness.The I.T. on this reel is stronger than others I have tried.If you are looking for a powered reel, I have had very good results with the Tarantula, which doesn't have any of the problems of this reel."
2,No instructions,No instructions come with this thread reel. They give a link wich was not working when I got my thread genie by magic makers and when it was finally working they only show how to do one trick. I could not find a dvd on how to use a tread reel like this so I have not realy used this product that much. I would not suggest this product to anyone unless you love magic and have a creative mind to make your on tricks. Also you have to a jacket on with an inside pocket to hide the thread genie.
1,Broke,This item broke after he played with it.Wouldnt get it again.It was a Christmas Stocking Stuffer.Didnt cost much so I guess it was ok.
2,not too good,"I love invisible thread! I love invisible thread reels! what I dont like, is not being able to fix them. I was working it on some stuff and It just snapped. seemed unfixable. just use regular IT"
4,Moving Translations,"I love poetry and I love the history of al-Andalus, so I raced through this book. The poetry is both beautiful and moving. Franzen's introduction states that this is a translation from a translation (Arabic to Spanish to English) so purists who speak either Arabic or Spanish may want to track down these poems in either the original or the first-remove. I do not speak either Arabic or Spanish and so cannot testify to Franzen's fidelity to the Arabic verse. I preferred Franzen to A.J. Arberry's more direct translation, however. Franzen's translations definitely work as emotionally powerful poetry."
5,Dr. Pryor's Lucky Number Master Dream Book,"Great numbers book. First written in 1956. I record my dreams and if a certain thing such as ""work"" occurs three or more times I play the three numbers associated with ""work"" in the book. There are numbers for first and last names and for zodiac signs. There is also a list of Psalms to read. The seller Indio Products is one of my favorites."
5,A Star on the Rise,"I just learned of Alex Bach a few weeks ago. After sampling her Amazon music downloads, I bought the CD. What a deep, rich, mesmerizing voice, mature beyond her years. On this album, Alex Bach exhibits the ability to either wrap her voice around a touching ballad ('Miles to Go)' or get-edgy-with-it on a song like 'Worthless'. She moves between genres with ease and there's a song on this CD to please everyone. My favorite is 'Anymore' which flows beautifully from beginning to end and captures the essence of Ms. Bach's voice and song writing ability.The EXPLICIT LYRICS tag is a sign of the times, something Roger Daltrey and the Who didn't have to deal with 25 some years ago when 'Who are You!' was penned. I hear only one word that pushes past the envelope and it took six times through the song before I picked it out.My prediction is that, once this young lady gets airplay, she'll immediately capture a lot of hearts and ears."
1,Enough already.,"Oh Puh-leease. Save your money and, instead, follow the class-action filed against CortiSlim for false advertising."
4,pretty good diet pills,I have been taking cortislim for about a week now i have lost about 3 lbs.i have alot of energy and sometimes i don't feel like eating. try for yourself i am gonna stick to it and see what the results will be.
1,SAVE your hard earned Cash...,"For 2 reasons...As stated by numerous other unfortunate consumers, this company has a class action lawsuit pending against them for false advertisement and making false and/or unfounded statements, and other things. You can review the Rejected application for FDA approval on the net.The other reason..I tried this stuff (another unfortunate consumer) before I found out about all of the lawsuits. I actually have one of the old bottles before they changed the label. It made me VERY bloated and gave me terrible pains in my stomach and digestive tract. I didn't lose any weight, in fact I gained a couple of pounds with the bloating. Yuk!"
2,Doesn't work...,This doesn't change your appetite and it doesn't do anything. I can't believe I fell for this one. I should have read the reviews posted first.
5,The Best of Barbara Fairchild,I loved this cd. It has many songs some of us will remember from our childhood. While it does not contain the contemporary type of praise and worship it has a wonderful southern blend of praise. Barbara's voice is at its best in this album. This is the second time I have bought this cd and it is one of those which I never get tired of. If you like old songs with a new beat you will love it too.
3,Not as expected!!,This cd turned out to be country gospel instead of the traditional country music she used to sing. Rather disappointingto say the least. If I had known it was christian I wouldn't have bought it because the only christian singer I like is Amy Grant! It's too bad that I could only buy Barbera's original country music on cassette a year ago because the cd wasn't available and now you can only get either version used. Most people may never know just how fantastic she really used to be because the song Teddy Bear was just the tip of the iceberg and sadly was her only hit song when she made others that were much better but didn't get the credit she truly deserved. She still has a good voice but she really needs to return to her roots and sing real country once again.
3,Reprint clarity,"Interesting book, but the reprint quality is poor. Barely could read some of it. Shipment was fine as usual with Amazon."
5,High quality and SHORT,"The book is full of 1 page wonders with great information of all aspects of life, specifically pertaining to Judaism."
3,"Review of ""It's not as Tough as You Think""",It's Not as Tough as You Think is a quick little book that attempts to cheer us up and make us feel better than we're feeling. The only trouble is with the book is that reading about how we should be feeling does not make us feel much better when we're down.
2,Flimsy and too light,"This item is described as being sturdy and ""commercial"" grade, but is, in reality, the flimsiest pot lid I ever saw. Way too light to really ""put a lid"" on a pot with boiling liquid. Manufacturer describes it as virtually indestructible, but I'm sure it would dent if dropped on the floor. I returned the item and actually found an Anolon glass lid of the same size, which is truly heavy and allows to watch what you're boiling."
4,Superior Swedish Detective Series,As someone with a Scandinavian background this series is far superior to its English remake. It would be even better if there is an occasional light moment.
5,Hooked!,"The whole series is worth watching. Excellent acting, great plots and gorgeous Swedish countryside. Enjoyed the Branagh series for Masterpiece but Henrickson will always be my choice for Wallander."
5,Great series,"The Swedish Wallander series is so good, and the episodes in season 1 all include Wallander's daughter, Linda. The Swedish series comes up with its own story lines but is ever faithful to the intent of the novels. My favorite thing about the Swedish series vs the British series is that Wallander is part of a real team of wonderful characters, and everyone is excellent!"
4,a fine book,"i don't see that this book is a bad one , in fact i find it much nicer than cinnamon which was a little bit silly about the spirits thing...ice is a very touching story, the only drawback i think was that it's short."
2,Good book,"I liked this one. i didnt read the first one cause of all the bad reviews, but i will read the rest!"
4,ICE...,The main charater in the story is Ice because she's not like other girls she is very quiet and won't talk much. He parent's don't get along that much because they fight all the time because the fight is alway about Ice.Her family lives in a small aparment because her dad has a job that don't pay much. So on one day her mom set her on a date because she got tired of her daughter not going out with anybody so that's why her mom set her on a date. Ice thought it was a bad idea because he was older than her but she went along with because she wanted to make her proud of her daughter. So she went to the jazz club with her date it was very good until he told the jazz player let Ice sing because she had a very beautiful voice.She when she sung the song she heard everybody clapping so after that she new she had a talent that might help her family out.
2,Ice-cold,"Ice was not as good as Cinnamon. Overall the quality of this series was pretty bad, but at least Ice wasn't as bad as Rose or Honey, in my opinion. This book was a bit interesting, but ultimately, like Cinnamon, it fell flat. This book feels nothing like a true VCA book with multigenerational family drama and secrets.I'm not sure what Neiderman was thinking when he came up with this series. I doubt that this series was inspired from the notes that VCA left after her death. Even on it's own, I can't really recommend it as a book to read, it relies on stereotypes (much like Rain) and the characters felt rather flat."
2,*HOTT*,"This book was unique to me since, it features a person with the name of ""Ice""!!! Her boyfriend was a cad in my opinion. I got the impression, that he didn't want his girlfriend Ice, to persue her time as a musician! Instead he wanted her to be a wife and homemaker-yawn!It's relatively good! It failed! WORK!"
4,DIFFERENT BUT GOOD,MAYBE THEY TRIED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE SERIOUS TYPE OF MUSIC TO THE MORE COMICAL SIDE. KEEP ROCKING !
4,SOMEWAY REMOTE FROM THEIR NORMAL STYLE,"I MISS THE SERIOUSNESS. WITH THIS EDITION THEY MAY LOOSE A FEW FANS , BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM WELL- KNOWN ARTISTS LIKE THE STONES IS ALLWAYS EXEPTABLE . GREAT STUFF . I LOVE IT."
5,So happy!,"I love this pendant. I purchased it, because it reminds me of a large outdoor decoration my late father made when I was little that hung from the from our front porch. It was exactly what I was looking for."
1,Malcolm X Deserves Better,"Such a great man and forward thinker deserves a more nuanced and subtle biography than this. The writing is ham-handed and thick, with gross characterizations and unoriginal observations."
4,A CHILLING DEBUT,"Youth prone to violence have been much in the news lately, and they take center stage in British lawyer Redmond's chilling debut.At Kirkston Abbey, a school for boys, kindness, nurturing, and care are not in the curriculum. But rather it is a place where class bullies torment during the night and unforgiving, tight-lipped instructors alternate humiliation with haranguing during the day.Thus, 14-year-old Jonathan Palmer, is grateful when he is befriended by wealthy loner Richard Rokeby, a student whose power makes him impervious to the cruelty of the instructors or his fellow students.As Richard takes the younger boy under his wing, Jonathan feels safe for the first time, not seeing that Richard is possessing him as well as protecting him.Safety, it seems,.has a price as violence spawns more violence and evil takes control. Something Dangerous is a well crafted Gothic tale, not for the weak of heart."
2,Almost so good,"I started this book with a sense of foreboding, the back cover review saw to that. In its early stages, Something Dangerous (aka ""The Wishing Game"" in Britain) is excellent. The actions of Rokeby towards his teachers and his class mates leave you feeling a little dubious. Would a 14-year-old actually ever act like that? You get over it and assume he would, but just as you get to the really good scenes, the author resorts to the use of infuriatingly wrong punctuation (! or ! ) and UPPER CASE FOR SHOUTING. It is all so disappointing. The reader is clever enough to spot a shout if the author is up to conveying it. I do not think Mr. Redmond is and there the novel falls apart. There are just a few things wrong with this novel, but they destroy the atmosphere of the story. You want to get immersed in the words but are constantly being put off by the delibrate basic English errors. A shame"
2,wait for the paperback,"Oh, God, another much-pushed much-hyped novel that proves itself unworthy. There's a strong sense of place and the author conveys a good glimpse into life at a British public school, but the author's style is shallow, melodramatic, and annoying, as is the characters' tendency to SHOUT AT EACH OTHER IN CAPITAL LETTERS! I felt like I was reading a young-adult novel -- except a lot of YA novels are better than this one. Robert Cormier's 'The Chocolate War', for example, also set at an all boy's school, is a much more powerful, intelligent, shattering work -- and addresses the issues of evil in a much richer fashion -- than Redmond's attempt."
3,Something Missing,"Not a bad first novel for Mr. Redmond, but still it leaves a little to be desired. I was expecting a deeper read than this. In a few spots I thought it was going to get there, but it just didn't. Overall this was an enjoyable story, but no where near the sense of forboding and build up that you get from the cover and first chapter. The reader is salivating for the big monster and there isn't one. Redmond looks a little young- is it possible his writing just needs to mature as well?"
2,Too broad and a bit rambling,"I kind of went ""Aw, come on!"" when I found out that the catalyst for all the trouble was a ouija board. In this age of really intelligent ghost stories (Sixth Sense, Blair Witch, e.g.), _Something Dangerous_ seemed weak in comparison. But _SD_ was not a ghost story! Or was it? Even that's not terribly clear. Jonathan, Richard, Nicholas et al seemed very stock. Where I personally wanted to story to go was into the real evil behind the ouija board (the ghost of Richard's mother?) and into the minds of the 2 main characters. For instance, Richard's personality problem (and subsequent power?) gets explained away much too glibly for my taste."
3,Book was excellent up to the conclusion.,"I was completly entralled with this book up until the conclusion which I thought was terrible. It was too involved, complex and disappointing."
4,Excellently disturbing,Just finished reading this today and am left with the satisfied feeling of a story tightly woven.I cared about the charactors and believed in the emotions that drove their actions.The book kept me in my chair night after night until it's conclusion; couldn't put it down. I highly reccommended it to others who like to be disturbed without being grossed out.
1,Laughably bad.,"This novel focuses on 14-year old boys in a British public school in 1957; but author seems completely ignorant of his setting. He's clueless about how 14-year old boys interact (in any era.) He presents a world where each of these boys analyzes every emotion he feels; everyone converses endlessly about their relationships with each other, sounding like 30-somethings in couples counseling (even a pair of twins).The adults are completely anachronistic; women are surprisingly savvy about battered wives syndrome, and in general everyone sounds like they're on ""Dr. Phil."" I'm surprised this was even published in Britain. This guy seems never to have read anything about the culture of public schools of that era. I guess fiction editors don't edit anywhere anymore."
3,just OK,"I waited to review this product. The winter months really chaps my skin, especially my lips and hands. I purchased this product in hopes of keeping my lips from drying out. It works OK, but it is a bit of a hassle. I think a regular lip balm works as well, but the mask does help exfoliate the dry skin from the lips. It works ok....not fantastic. Worth the buy/try if you suffer from day, cracked, chapped lips as I do. I may purchase it again if my lips prove to stay cracked free this winter."
5,Very nice!,"I love this product; I went to a Mary Kay Bronze Boot Camp in Tyler and I tried this and it was fabulous!! I will tell you, you will not recieve bottles like the ones in the picture. They're small tubes but it doesn't take much! Love this stuff!"
5,Mary Kay Satin Lips,"I have tried almost everything to try and clear up my chapped lips. Nothing I tried worked even though it was supposed to work miracles. I decided to try Mary Kay Satin Lips, and it has worked. I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone."
1,My lips felt WORSE after using Satin Lips,"Living in an arid climate, I tend to have problems with my lips getting dry and cracked. So I decided to try Mary Kay's Satin Lips. The exfoliating mask worked tolerably well, but the balm seemed to actually make my lips WORSE, though it is supposed to deeply condition lips over a span of several hours. I have gotten much better results with just plain old Chapstick. Save your money and avoid this product."
1,Slowly dying,"I have the same experience as N. Parker. I bought this less than six months ago and its performance has een erratic and the maximum charge has been declining rapidly. Instead of hibernating, when the battery level drops the machine just shuts down altogether. I'm going to get a proper Apple battery now. The savings was not worth it."
3,A little disappointed,The color and pattern are as expected from the photo and I like the design/ look of the bumper. The quality is below average. One of the strings broke off after a couple of weeks and it looks/ feels flimsy. I spent quite a bit more on another one from Pottery Barn and can definatley tell the difference in quality.
3,"cute, but the fabric is not great for the money","Just washed this for the first time, delicate cycle in the washer, low heat delicate on the dryer. The gingham side pilled really bad so it feels very rough on that side, (the side that will face the baby.) It fits the crib nicely and I like the colors, but for the money they could have used some fabric that would remain soft. I'm a little disappointed."
1,"Bad color, cheap fabric","I bought the red gingham bumper, bedskirt and sheet. They just arrived today and I was so disappointed! The red is kind of a orangey light red and the fabric looks very cheap and loosely woven. This is not the quality I wanted for my baby's crib."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this pad to save myself the hassle of making one. The construction is not the greatest nor the fabric. I washed the pad, per the instructions, and it came out pilly and in some places unravelled. I've taked a sweater shaver to the whole thing to get the rough fuzz balls off. I wouldn't waste your time and money on this product."
2,too hard to install,"I just got this a few days ago and now that I'm home I'm very disappointed. The bumper is just one piece, not a four piece bumper as I thought it would be... the one that I have on my daughter's crib is a four separate piece bumper and we could put it very easily, but we wanted another one so we could use it above the one we already have (our 9 months old daughter is moving and playing a lot, and we didn't want her to bump her head against the upper part of the crib). This particular bumper is so much harder to put up. My husband took quite a while and it still doesn't stay put as it should. We had to attach an additional string until I can take it and have it fixed somewhere. We live in Ecuador, so I will have to manage with what I have or it would take forever to return it and get a new one. Wouldn't recommend it, really."
4,Does the job,This crib bumper is fine. Works as described. The ties are a little tricky to use with our particular crib style.
2,defected,This bumper feels soft and looks beautiful. The green color is very delicate (lighter than it looks in the picture); unfortunately the bumper they sent me was missing several strings :-(
4,Tadpoles BASIC Gingham and Tadpoles CLASSIC Gingham are different colors...,"I purchased several tadpoles green gingham crib bedding items: crib skirt, fitted sheets, bumper & diaper stacker. I did not pay close attention to the item descriptions however and failed to distinguish between the Tadpoles Classic Gingham and Tadpoles Basic Gingham. The two are not the exact same color. While they are both green gingham the Tadpoles Classic is distinctly more yellow-ish and the Tadpoles Basic is definitely more of a bright green. The set however is very cute and simple. Looking forward to using it in my daughter/son's room."
4,Our Favorite Bridge Game,"My husband and I play this as much as our other favorite, Scrabble. It's true that your opponents sometimes make dumb moves, and so does your partner, but the graphics are great, which makes the game very enjoyable. All other bridge games we've tried have small cards and dull pictures. True, you win more often than you would in real life, but that's part of the fun. It's also a great way to learn the game, because, unlike real life, you can complete a lot of games very quickly and get the hang of it as you go. The game won't let you make an illegal move."
1,Game is not too interesting,"boring, not much too it, waste of money. Need no skill to play these games"
2,Not much here,"I'm looking for something to help me ""prejudge"" a new player to the table and he really doesn't give me much that would be helpful. I'm glad I didn't pay full price."
2,Not much Here,"This is a pretty short book that I believe lacks substance. I guess it is good to think about some of the items, but the entire book could have been summarized in 3 or 4 pages. I was hopeful at first when the author mentioned having researched FBI profiling techniques. This in itself would be interesting to me, but there seemed to be so much left out unless the FBI only has a small pamphlet on profiling. Some chapters seemed to be text cited from other sources with loose application, at best. I do not think there is much here except for 2 or 3 good points. Not worth the price if you ask me."
2,Just Common Knowledge,"I didn't find much use for this book. This author's explanations on ""profiling"" will not help anyone who has basic common sense. The profiling facts offered don't translate into real help in beating the types of poker players we often confront. e.g. I'll paraphrase one profile: -People who refuse to tip the dealer after winning a hand are cheap and self-centered. People who do tip are typically compassionate and more likely to have a feel for what other people are doing. Do you want one more? OK. -People who dress smartly, wear expensive clothes and play in low-stakes poker games probably don't care as much about the money involved than the thrill of playing the game. If these common sense facts are new to you, and you think they can help you play better, then buy this book. If not, save your money."
2,Nothing insightful here,"Most everything included here is common sense. There are a few important concepts included here, but they are better covered in other texts."
2,The Vat. Mixtape part 1 - was a waste of my money,Ray's STYLE is exqtisitely unique.Personally this cd was just a Raekwon's greatest hits Dj Mix.
5,Prettier than the picture!,"I love this bowl! Perfect size for cereal or soup and I love seeing that pretty palm tree in the bottom when I'm finished with my meal. Liked it so much I ordered the salad plate and dinner plate too. Fun yet sophisticated. I live in Hawaii and have lots of tropical themed tableware, but this is my favorite pattern. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!"
1,This product has become garbage,"It broke the first time I used it.The previous VacuVin opener I owned lasted 8 years (over 2,000 bottles opened) until it broke but the new one broke the first time I used it. It was not ""operator error"" because of my 8 years experience with the product.$50 down the drain. Don't buy this product, you will be sorry."
4,Fantastic opener with excellent customer service,"So, like everyone else has already said at length, this is a wonderful device that makes it very easy to open bottles (and the foil cutter works well, too). As has also been noted, you need to be very sure that you only use it AFTER you've removed the foil, and only for ""standard"" size bottles.What others have gotten notably wrong is that there is EXCELLENT customer service available in the U.S. Looking at the vacuvin website, you can quickly get to their webpage with ""international"" offices, one of which is in North Carolina. I called them and they were extremely helpful. The day after they received my broken winemaster, they sent me out a new one via second day air -- all at no cost to me (other than shipping the old one to NC, which was about $5)."
2,Works Great When It Works,Loved this wine opener initially...problem is the gears jump and you have to take it apart to get it fixed and working again.
1,It broke,"We thought we'd found a cork puller worthy of Nirvana. Alas, it turned out to be an illusion. First, the four fingers that hold the bottle's neck refused to let go after we extracted corks. Then one of the fingers broke off at the base. We're sad, because during the first few months, it worked well."
5,My Vacu Vin had problems now it works great!,"The secret to using the VacuVin is to push the cork remover onto the bottle as firmly as possible and pull the sleve down as far as it will go(or it will never properly work!!!); Than your VacuVin will work like a pro. The first time I rated it 1 star because the rubber piece that holds the cork in place broke off, and despite following the instructions by the book(I was afraid to pull the sleve down to far) I could only pull the cork out half way. I tried it four more times and each time it produce the same results only half the cork out of the bottle(while making it almost impossible to pull the rest out). but now I would definitely rate this five stars having carefully followed the instructions to a tee."
2,was broken when I received it!,the product was broken when I received it! not real happy about that.The cutter has two plastic clips that secure it to the opener. One of them was broken. It no longer will fasten to the opener.
3,Disappointed & embarrassed,"I ordered two of the Vacu Vin WineMasters for Christmas gifts for a friend and a family member. I had read reviews on all of the wine openers listed, and did take note of the problem with the plastic tabs breaking off, (which held the foil cutter) after continued use. I was planning on telling both of them not to store the cutter in the plastic tabs. However, I was very embarrassed when my friend informed me that he received his already broken upon opening. I purchased him a different type opener, and will be returning his defective one. Everything else I have ever purchased at Amazon has always arrived when promised, and has been top quality, with the exception of this. I suppose it had been returned, and just got shipped out again."
5,STOP LOOKING - and get this corkscrew!!,"I have tried all the others - air injectors, expensive rabbit ears (lever), etc and this corkscrew is FAR SUPERIOR. The first time I tried it I thought it was broken because the cork came out so easily (AND I didn't even read the instructions) - not really sure where some people get confused using this... push down the lock cylinder on the bottle top, push down the small levers, push down the big levers - DONE! Push 'em both back up and the cork spits out. The above steps are done with such ease that it doesn't seem like it's doing anything - but once it's pulled the cork, the locking cylinder on the bottle automatically releases.I also enjoy the look of the thing - rather ""DaVinci-esk"" and makes a great looking conversation piece on the counter. Oh - and the foil cutter is cleverly attached to the top, so you don't need to go searching for it, like with all the other screws.Hope this helps! Enjoy!"
1,Requires engineering degree and the touch of a surgeon,"I've seen two of these break. The part that encircles the neck is fragile. If someone who hasn't read the instructions tries to use it, they never get the encircling part latched properly.I read the manual and did everything right except I attempted to pull the cork, without removing the foil (admittedly not a good practice) and it broke immediately. It was a friend's and I had to replace it, leaving me with a foil cutter extra. It's a good foil cutter but not worth$50."
5,It's so easy to fall in love!,"My daughter is yet to be four years old and can open a bottle of vino with this thing. It is absolutely great! It is so slick, I HAVE to let my kids open my wine bottles. They really get a kick out of it. No more chewed up corks. No more corks falling into the bottle. Not a single problem that I can note. Well worth the money."
1,You need three arms...,I returned this--absolutely unusable. Could not keep bottle engaged WHILE pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms.
5,Love this corkscrew!,"I struggled with every bottle of wine I have ever opened and have passed the nasty task off to anyone within yelling distance until one night at my neighbor's house she pulled out this baby and opened a bottle of wine in nothing flat. Hers is black and I really wanted a black one but this was the only one they had and I had to have it immediately. I love it! I no longer struggle to open a bottle of wine, in fact, I enjoy it! I use the foil cutter first then quickly pull out the cork, Voila! It then drops the cork out with no struggle at all! I am ordering one for a friend for Christmas and I know she will enjoy it as much as I do!"
2,Breaks VERY easily,"Our Vacu Vin wine opener partially broke in the first week we owned it. There is a plastic internal part that broke off. The part is sort of a stopper to keep you from moving the housing that goes onto the bottle too far. We limped along with this opener for the next year - mechanically it is a great design and we love it for that. But finally, while opening a bottle, the housing shattered. I don't understand why they don't make this otherwise great wine opener with metal or some other stronger material. It just doesn't hold up over time."
2,"Worked for a while, then - not!","This item was a gift, and worked well for a while, then the rubber gripping surfaces detached, one by one. They were designed by a sadist: while it was possible to reinstall them, the operation took way too much time and caused much frustration. I did find that if you were left with at least two functional grippers (of four), and made sure they gripped opposite sides of the neck of the bottle, it would still work (after a fashion). But finally one of the little plastic parts inside the mechanism (mentioned in several other reviews) shattered. Now it is (sadly) just a conversation piece, and I've gone back to a $2 lever corkscrew - it isn't as pretty, but it works just fine!"
4,Aquaman Turns in a Fine Peformance,This was a good read with Aquaman out of the sea. With his Kingdom turned against him for his Actions during the Obsidian Age story line in JLA(Great Read by the Way). Aquaman gains the Waterbearer hand which gives him mystical powers and allows him to do things he couldn't before. One of the few Aquaman graphic novels out there and it is a pretty good one. If your an Aquaman fan like myself give it a read.
2,Blah....fishy!!,"There is a very good reason there have been so many attempts at a successful solo Aquaman series. The reason is that Aquaman just can't support his own title. The character actually isn't that interesting. His supporting cast are one note and his villains are normally pretty lame. Now all this doesn't mean all the books are bad but there just isn't enough there for longevity. Here, in I believe the sixth volume of Aquaman, the status quo changes for him and Atlantis, but its still pretty boring. You can only have so many adventures in the deep before they seem repetitive. The story by Rick Veitch is pretty bland. The art by Guichet is good and makes the undersea stuff look dynamic at times but its pretty hard to convey cool looking stuff when Aquaman is inhabiting the body of a fish who has been eaten by another fish. Overall, an average read. Par for the course for Aquaman."
4,Cute - keeps them busy,Both my daughters look the CD while we are in the car in traffic. Cute stories.
5,disney read along CDs,"another 'worth the money' disney product. loved it! bought this as a christmas present for my 3yr old g'dghtr. watching her 'read along' outloud was too funny. i actually got this as a help-mate for bedtime because neither she or her 7yr old sister ever want to go to bed let alone fall asleep w/in minutes. this worked out great..first read the story to them (books are adorable) and then pop in the cd and they can 'listen' to it again. worked like a charm and no more ""please..just one more story??!!"" i highly reco this product and getting her the little mermaid next for her february bday :)"
5,Great pad,Very sturdy and at a good price. Perefect for the drummer who needs a pad to practice on. Can sit right on a desk for breaks during homework.
3,NOT the pictured item,"This pad seems to be the same material as my genuine HQ real feel pad, BUT it is a wood center. It has the name stamped on instead of build into the pad. Nit-picky as it may seem i do NOT take kindly to being sold a different item than pictured. I think this seller should get in trouble for this deceptive practice. I am taking two stars off for this. However, the pad on inspection (just took it out of the box) will likely function similarly. ...the rubber really stinks though. Hope this fades. If you really want the one in the picture, go with a different seller."
5,Gets the Job Done,"This practice pad was everything I was looking for. It's a great size for any level drummer, and sticks bounce nicely on both sides of the pad. You won't be disappointed. I bought this solely for strengthening my left hand's coordination and technique, and it's getting the job done as expected. There are many great practice pads out there, but this one is great for the price attributed to it. I would recommend this for any drummer."
4,Solid,"A solid practice pad with nice rebound on the soft side and the challenging hard side with less bounce. Did come as the pad I ordered here, but all the other reviews mention that already. It's still the same pad with the same quality."
4,Best pad i've had so far,"I got this pad for marching snare. It's harder side has a good feel and is good for being able to hear what you're playing, and the softer side is good if you don't want to make a lot of noise. It's pretty durable, and I take it with me wherever I go. Overall, it's a good pad for the price"
5,Great drum pad,I had my first reel feel since 1994 and this one appears to be awesome so far.....Drum music here I come...
5,Evans pad makes me want to practice,"Great pad, good solid construction and feel, sits in the snare stand nicely. Bouncy but not too bouncy on the grey side, the black side feels more like a marching snare or a cymbal."
4,Evans Practice Pad,"Works Well,as advertized.I am very happy with this product and recommend it to any one who is looking for a drum practice pad."
4,A Good Read For Lovers Of Classic Monster Movies.,"If you love these old movies as much as I do,and are interested in the story of how they came about,script development,etc.,then this book is for you! Did you know that in the earlier drafts,the Lon Chaney character was named Larry GILL and was no relation to the Talbot family? I didn't,until I read this book. This,along with more tidbits of interest make for a very informative and great read. I would however prefer that they didn't go into such detail about the folklore of werewolves,and stayed more on the subject of the movie. They also needn't print so many of the posters advertising the film,as a few should have been sufficient. Other than that,I would definitely recommend it."
4,String review,I like the strings. i use them on my Martin D28 standard. I might use a lighter gauge next time just for fun.
2,Heavy on conspiracy theory and light on facts,"The format of this book was illogical and repetitive. The freedom of information trials and the FLIR analysis, although important, were given a great amount of attention most likely because the author was involved in these two topics. The reader could easily skim or skip to chapter 11 without missing much. The chapters covering the reconstruction of the events on Feb 28 and Apr 19 however, were very good and largely unbiased, apart from editorial comments. The discussion of CS gas and related issues was very informative but scattered throughout several chapters. A diagram of the compound would have helped the author reconstruct the events in more detail. Overall, I felt that this author took the easy way out by focusing on certain topics and sticking solidly to the pro Branch Davidian point of view."
1,A Metaphor of a Metaphor As Theology,"Ashbrook admits to his argument being entirely a metaphor. Then he uses a metaphor to look at his metaphor. The layers of symbolism and poetic technique end up obscuring most of what is useful while only pretending to tie together the two original ideas. His partition of God's activity into two categories is arbitrary and artificial, which makes connecting them to the design of the human brain likewise arbitrary. How we engage with theology, yes, that could theoretically have something to do with the specialization of brain hemispheres, but that simply wasn't what I was interested in and not what I felt like he originally posited. While Ashbrook pioneered the integration of neuroscience and theology, I just don't feel as if he did it particularly well."
3,I'd really like to give this book a 3 1/2 star rating!,"Although I enjoyed reading Ms. Matthews story, I felt that the story was lacking substance in regard to the character's interaction. Both Raven and Garreth themselves are wonderful characters who are well developed, but I felt that they never really got to know one another. There was great depth into how Raven felt as a midwife (which was great), and we know that Garreth is a brooding hero, but somehow they never, well...talk. Raven falls in love with Garreth and he with her, but in the book, they ony talk a few times, before they deside to get married. This all just seemed a little abrupt to me. I would have liked to have seen their relationship grow.As for the rest of the story, it was quite wonderful. The secondary characters bring color and life the the story and made reading a pleasure. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a good plot and well a defined hero and heroine."
4,Deeply Moving and Inspirational,"I thought I knew who Myrlie Evers-Williams was. She is much more than ""the widow of."" She worked her way to the top of the private sector, government and one of the country's oldest and most well known organizations, the NAACP. She did all of this while raising 3 children alone after the death of her husband.This book is a guide and an inspiration to all women. It is ironic that while I was reading this book her husband's murderer, Byron DeLaBeckwith, died. I did not know how long she worked to bring his killer to justice and how much more grief she had to bear in doing so.Myrlie Evers-Williams is an amazing woman. Anyone interested in the history of the civil right's movement, women's issues, or modern American history will enjoy this book."
4,"I love Mystic so the CD was Awesome, but the shipping on this was horrible","I love this artist, but by the time I got the CD, I had forgotten that I order it... Great CD though!!"
2,"The End of the World as We know It, and I'm Bored!","This book is an anthology of nuclear war short stories starting in 1946 and ending in the 1980's. The 1940-50's era stories are dated to such a degree as to seem almost a satire. Some of the 1960-70's stories are actually recyled from a collection of end-of-the-world stories published by the Zero Population Growth movement in the 70's (remember them?)All-in-all, a mediocre collection without much to recommend it."
4,Itchy???,"The book is outstanding save for one yawner. The end of the world is way cool!! (I'm a pessimistic fatalist...or a fatalistic pessimist, YOU pick)"
3,The Raine maker goes at it again,"Credit Nic Raine for his tenacity and continuing efforts towards recreating seemingly all of John Barry's musical output. Unfortunately, he has never been able to coax consistant performances from the City Of Prague Orchestra. As usual, the lush, symphonic pieces fare much better than the more lively compositions. The 'James Bond Theme' starts off well (helped by the participation of Vic Flick, the original 1962 session guitarist), but then loses its momentum during the bridge, as it has always done under Raines' baton.Despite some flat brass, off notes, and stale staccatos (amongst other shortcomings) here and there, it's a marvelous idea and a recommended purchase for fans of the genre. Raine's liner notes are entertaining, as well. I look forward to his take on the Moore era."
2,Bad CD,"To start out, this CD contains all the un-released music from the first 7 Bond movies. But they are all recreations of the missing songs. The music that you get are remakes of the ones done by John Barry. So this creates 3 problems: The songs are either too fast, to slow, or don't sound like the originals at all. It is a horrible CD. Two stars for the effort but minus three for bad remakes. Think twice before buying this CD."
3,"Nice Effort, But....","Nic Raine, The City of Prague Philharmonic, and Silva Records must be applauded for their efforts to recreate not just the Bond sounds, but much of the music of John Barry in earlier recordings. ""Bond Back in Action"" is itself a good idea, especially the inclusion of previously unrecorded parts of the early Bond scores. The down side is the unavoidable feeling one gets listening to this music...""I wish these were the original cuts, and I wish John Barry was conducting."" Even with the best of these recordings, something is missing...Barry, himself. Sadly, most of the unreleased music is still in existence, and John Barry is still with us. It would be delightful if Barry would produce, or record an album of unreleased Bond music, along with some of the missing recordings of other music (the original scores to ""Mary Queen of Scots"" and ""The Last Valley,"" come to mind). In the meantime, Raine's interpretations will have to do."
4,Breaking The Myth,"The writings are scant on the coyote but this book answers many questions. First hand observations,natural history, the past history of man vs. coyote and photographs. There are many wonderful aspects to this book but what is most compelling is the way Hope Ryden shows the coyote as a resourceful, affectionate and intelligent creature rather than its familiar portrayal as a pest and killer. Much more than a field study this book is written from the heart."
4,Great Book,Love the book. I feel there might be a subtle hint of trying to make you think of the coyote more as a domestic dog but otherwise great.
5,"Great item, but a very pricey","I expected the item to arrive with more supplies and some paper for first time use. My husband and I both agree that the item is well made, durable and the kids love it. The price was just too high, at [$$$] for the item plus shipping, because the item was heavy,this was a [$$$] purchase. Assembly was easy enough, except that the holes on the chalkboard were a little off and it took brute force the line the holes up for the bolt. All in all if I could have returned it without paying another [$$$] I probably would have and spent my [$$$] on art supplies alone. I hope this easel will last through all my children, that way maybe I'll feel justified in the price I paid."
4,Keeps Cool but Doesn't Chill,"This is such a handy thing to have around if you enjoy white wine. I keep both of mine in the freezer -- always at the ready.However, I found that if you need wine instantly chilled (e.g. if you pick it off the shelf or out of a wine rack, as opposed to the refrigerator) this is not the best bet. Rather, this is a great tool to keep pre-chilled wine at an appropriately cool temperature.Notes: 1.) The design is quite charming -- appropriate for men and women.2.) If you're a champagne drinker, you may want to get a wider-sized version of this product, as there are some available. This model does not fit larger-based champagne bottles.Cheers!"
3,"Works okay, not great.","This is an okay product, it didn't get my white wine nearly cold enough. You might get the same results or better if you put your bottle of wine in a cooler with ice and water."
4,wine chiller,This product works well. Small enough to keep in freezer for when you need it. Fits onto wine bottle and stays in place well without sliding down. Made a great gift and also kept one for myself.
4,Good cooler,"My only complaint about this wine cooler is that it does not fit on larger bottles of wine. It works great for cooling smaller bottles, but is too small for the quart size.I bought one for each one of my 3 sons as Christmas gifts. I just hope they are not too disappointed in them."
4,Important accessory for Vacu Vin stainless steel wine chiller,"Suggest purchasing one of these ice wine chillers as a second liner for the Vacu Vin stainless steel wine chiller. They remain flexible when frozen and fit easily into the Vacu Vin container. They keep bottles of soda, beer, water and even wine, icy cold for several hours. I have never tried using it by itself, just wrapped around a bottle. I suspect condensation would be an issue when used alone. That is not a problem when inserted into the Vacu Vin container."
1,Amazon warrantees cannot be trusted,I bought an Amazon warrantee for my last camcorder (not this warranty). That cheep a** Samsung Xacti camera gave me the white screen after just a couple of months. The warranty people are nice on the phone ... all four times I've called. They keep telling me they'll send the empty return box but they haven't yet. I know they are stalling until my warrantee runs out. I blame Amazon for promoting the warranty to me.
3,Unsure how to rate,"I am unsure how to rate this item since I have not had to use the warranty service. However, I have never received anything from them despite 2 phone calls and assurances that I would. By that I mean, I have never received anything saying that I do have coverage. But the operator did tell me feel confident that the item is covered. So time will tell for me."
3,"If you like Tu Poc, listen to this","Byrdman has some real musical hooks, and strong vocal delivery. Worth checkin out."
4,a D.C. comments,"Offers the intriguing hypothesis that the primary cause of many functional and structural disturbances is fixation/adhesion of visceral articulating surfaces. Can be used as a textbook of diagnosis and treatment by those trained in bodywork, especially those familiar with the subtle osteopathic cranial techniques."
5,"Clear, and well thought out",This is a must have for anyone interested in abdominal palpation and treatment. The authors convey a vast amount of information in a well organized format. A great companion to Hara Diagnosis: Reflections on the Sea.
5,"Excellent Book, Highly Recommended For Any Python Programming","This is definitely a must have for anyone doing Python (Network) programming.The 175 included working applications make it so easy to implement and actually use the code.John's knowledge of the topic is deep (Advanced Linux Programmer and author) and he is very good at writing on advanced topics while still keeping them easy to understand.So many clean, elegant code examples with just enough explanation:Avoiding Deadlock,Forking & LockingThreading,Understanding Init,Database Clients,Understanding SSL In Python,CGI & Mod_PythonAdvanced Network Operations (Half open sockets, Timeouts, Understanding Byte Order, etc.)Etc."
1,Not Python 3,"As someone who ordered it before release (being told by Amazon it dealt with python 3), I'm VERY disappointed it still deals with python 2. 'Will ask for a refund."
4,Effective and reasonable.,"You'll pay more for a much less effective terminal protector. If you think car and truck battery's terminals rust, try a boat. Work with all batteries not just marine."
4,"light weight, and great for air-travel","The blanket kept me warm on the plane, but was not as soft as I had expected. The small pillow case is very soft and silky. The eye-cover is great at keeping out the light so you can sleep :)"
5,How foolish we are to think we know the mind of God,"I received this book while attending Bible college. I have used it a lot through the years. One devotion in particular called""Bits & Pieces"". Working in the ministry or just having people move in and out of your life, this one has always touched my heart. Loaned it out about 5/6 years ago, never got it back.I would like to see it in print again. These short to thepoint devotions had a unique way of looking at our relationshipwith God. A book that speaks to any generation. Looking to obtainanother one to pass on to my children."
5,This stuff rocks,I am not sure why i need regular titebond now other than the cost. This stuff takes a lot of stress out of more complex glue ups. And the same clamp time - about 2 hours.BEWARE: the pic above is for extend II and this page is for regular extend - not the same water resistance.
3,What's with the music?,"I loved the interviews with the artists, but the background music was quite distracting. The music was so loud, I could barely hear the responses.The lineup was great and I love the work of all who were interviewed in this film, so no complaints there."
1,Don't waste your money.,The pieces are too difficult to remove. They are smooth and the clamp cannot grasp the objects.
5,Nice,"The pictures are incredibly detailed, and the book covers every inch of this mighty figter. Top notch photography."
4,Tomcat memories,This is a great book in a compact size. Lots of great pictures. Great detail for the modeler and a must for the Tomcat fans. Its a small book but is packed with great photos.
4,no king of the mountain,was a good PPV would have been better if it featured the PPV's signature match but other wise a well done ppv
4,maryam from ababacar Mali,This is a story about girl and boy who are going to the city of Jo' burg to find the their mother. Because their baby sister is really sick. What i like about this book is that even during hard times the two kids really hold on to each other. What i don't like is the sad ending. I recommamend this book to people who like emotive strories. it's a book that could teach you lessons about life.
2,"It's Okay, Not Great","Journey to Jo'burg is an emotional novel about blacks in South Africa during the 1980's. The story has cliffhangers, but they are not as surprising as we thought or hoped. We rated this novel two stars because it was too predictable and too short. It did not contain enough description of the actual journey, and we did not feel that we really got to know the characters very well. We were emotionally disappointed."
3,A Review On Journey to Jo'Burg,"Journey to Joburg is a well written and compelling book. I was assigned to read to read this as an end of the year book. It is not as good or bad as you think it is. The book should be called ""Saving Dineo"" beacause it is more about telling their mother about their sisters life threatening illness than traveleing to Jo'burg. I think this book would be excellent for a third grader. It is right along their level of reading."
1,Not good,"This was a boring book. The title is deciving. It might be good for 1st and 2nd graders, however.Nadeli and Tiro go to Jo'burg to find there mother, because their little sister Dineo is dying. But that is all that seems to happen, and they really don't spend much time in Jo'burg. Overall, it is a boring book"
4,A Rating for Jo'burg,"Journey to Jo'burg wa an O.K book. It wasn't a topselling thriller like Harry Potter or something, but it was overall an O.K book. Although this book was good it was to short. It didn't let you get to know the characters to have that emotional connection with them. Also the chapter titles gave the whole book away. Like you could predict the book by the chapter titles. Also this book needs more detail. You could describe this book in a couple of sentences. To really get into this book you would have to really stop and take a couple of paragraphs to describe each character, then a couple of pages to tell their background and features. This book is also not sixth grade level. The words are simple, it is more like a third grade reading novle. That is what i think about the novel Journey to Jo'burg."
5,Read this book...,This book tells of the troubled South Africa in the 1980's whereapartheid was in control. A very good book...
3,Sweet & short story,"This was a quick read for myself and my two children, ages 11 & 13. I enjoyed it more than they did. It gives the reader an inside look at the effects apartheid had on a specific family."
2,Why It could be Better,The Journey to Jo'burg is not that good of a book. The level of literature is very low. If you are a high level reader than this is not the book for you. The events happen to quickly. That is why I do not like. It is a book for a lower level reader. If you do not like a short a simple plot with quick event. The Frytags pyramid is the structure of a book. The inticing moment gets a story started. the inticing moment in this book is very short and is not very good. the Rising action is the second part to a book.
2,Ok,"This book is ok. It doesn't have much of a story, but it's ok. You don't really get to know the characters. It has a few cliff hangers. But not that many. Overall, it's pretty boring. But, there are a few ok parts. My classmates had the same idea."
2,Journey,"This book was ok but the title is Journey to Jo'burg but there was only about 2 chapters on the journey. And the auther misspelled Tiro, she spelled it Tira! The problem of the story is in the begining when we hardly even know who Dineo is. Only read this book whe you have to or if you like black history."
4,A South African Story,"The main character in this book is Naledi. She is caring, brave, and curious. The plot of the story is as follows: Naledi and Tiro went on a journey, because their sister was very ill. On the journey they discovered how blacks were treated by whites. Some examples are: they had to sit at the back of the bus; they had to have passes to travel; they had to work as servants; and they were harrassed by the police. They went to seach for their Mma. Will they find Mma? Will they save their sister Dineo?- You should read this book to find out!- by Sierra Serrano (Age 12), Johnnie Basham (Age 10), and Garrett Kovach (Age 11)"
4,nice adventure,"I think that this was a great book for my eight year old and not only could we experience a bit of culture through the lens of two South African children, but we learned about SA itself. I think its a brilliant read for young readers jumpping into their first ""long/longer"" reads.Great book"
5,Short and Powerful,"I read this book a few years when I was in 4th grade. At first, I thought it would be boring, because it was so short. However, I was completely surprised. The book moved quickly and taught me about the injustices of Apartheid."
4,Jo' Burg Book Review,"In a short and simple book, ""Journey To Jo' Burg"" informs us about the system of ""apartheid"" - the worse form of racial segreation that existed in South Africa. It's really the only book that introduces kids to apartheid. I also thought Naledi was very brave to go to Jo'Burg to get her mother home. I admire her courage to take risks in order to save her baby sister's life. But what I would like the author to do is to describe the evils of the apartheid a bit more. Overall, this is a very good book."
4,Effective but not for daily use.,Very effective but scent too strong for daily usage. Good for camping but do not recommend for a walk in the neighborhood.
1,Shipping and Handling Ripoff,This company will rip you off with shipping and handling. They post the lowest prices then gouge you with S&H.; Consider these folks to be among those that engage in deceptive business practices.They also didn't respond to my email when I wrote to complain.Don't buy anything from this business. Let's collectively send them the message that these sorts of business practices are not acceptable.
2,"Good album, poor 5.1 mix","4 stars for the album / 0 stars for the 5.1 mix - Stick with the CD version of Germfree Adolescents.The 5.1 advanced resolution does not improve this album and the mix is bad, especially in the LFE/subwoofer channel. The low end is mixed so heavy on some songs that you can barely hear the guitars. I can't believe this poor mix was even allowed to be released to the public.Next time I'll do a little research instead of relying on Amazon descriptions that say ""stunning 5.1 surround sound"". I've since seen a ""Silverline DVD-A Winners & Losers"" thread on a multichannel sound website that warns of the ""mega bass"" on this album. Oh well, live and learn."
1,Bad Design,I bought this years ago as a close-out and was only able to use it twice. (Deviled eggs both times.) The cordless 4 AA battery-operated motor just gave out. I would like to reuse the discs and nozzles on an electric or manual press but haven't gotten enough information to know if they will fit any current models.
1,do not waste your money,My wife has this and used it for the first time this year to make cookies for Christmas. Did not work. The end that screws on kept popping off. She had to go old school with a roller and cookie cutters. Threw out this piece of junk. Hamilton Beach used to make good products years ago. Too bad.
2,"BEWARE, YOU WILL NOT GET WHAT IS SHOWN!","I am going to take a wild guess that very soon Adorama will have the photo posted up here changed to reflect what you are REALLY getting, which is the boring albums they have posted elsewhere. I ordered this one in particular cause it looked nice with the fancy spine design (Not the one with the boring gold foil boxes, like all the other leather type binders from Adorama)and the cover design seemed nicer to me. However, when I ordered the album, I got the boring one, NOT the one shown. So if you are thinking of purchasing this album because it looks more aesthetically pleasing, you will be stumped over the head when you get the binder and say ""Hey, this is the version I passed up for the one pictured!"" Fooled me once, shame on me."
2,Over-reaction to expository preaching,"Ogden has a discernible disdain for expository preaching in his emphasis on community relationships as the main vehicle for discipleship. What he sees as a threat to building self-feeding, multiplying disciples is actually the God-ordained means of seeing individuals grow in grace and love for one another. The preached Word ought to be the meat which our discipleship relationships help to digest, understand and apply. The preached message ought to be central to what we are doing in community with one another."
4,Huge but beautiful,"Those dishes are on the bigger side. The plates are larger than usual, the bowls are huge and the mugs make a drink last forever.BUT they are beautiful!!!! I love those dishes. I started collecting this model by buying the serving dishes, then I got the 12 service set. It is a nice addition on the table when you have guests, but for every day use, it might be just too large.It comes in 3 boxes, each box has a service of 4. You get a box, with a box inside it, with the actual Pfaltzgraff box inside it. It is very carefully packed, but just too much recyclable stuff. Our can was full very quickly.It is dishwasher and microwave safe. I love this set."
1,Terrible Product,If I could give this set of dishes a 0 I would do so. This is not the Pfaltzgraff I know and love. One plate was chipped into right out of the box and one of the plates I simply picked up to put away and it chipped. My old set that is the Yorktown pattern was made right here in the USA. I have had this set for over 30 years and not one piece has ever been broken and no chips. The new crap made in China is just junk. I will never buy another piece of Pflatzgraff. This new junky set is getting packed up and thrown into the dump. Am going back to the old set.
3,too big,"I was so excited about the dishes. They are really pretty, but look like they are made for a giant. The plates were so big that they would not fit in my cabinet. I had no choice but to return them and pay the large return fee."
3,Well ummmm I guess old geezers would find this good.,"I'm not saying that I didn't like this movie,it's just that it's really old and it coulden't do much of the stuff that movies these days do.First of all,they didn't show all of the 1st ghost,the second ghost,all of the third,and the 4th is really stupid,A FINGER!YOU CALL THAT A GHOST!"
1,"Marginal at best, barely worth one point, let alone five","This was very disappointing. Lots of emotionalism, little of philosophical value. I read the book to try and understand the viewpoints of those who apparently don't believe in knowing where they are going before they leave. (Which of course would make one wonder how they knew when they had arrived?) I'd include my email address but I don't want those who believe in this book to fill up my in-box!I'm not certain of its Btu value but, dear reader, that's exactly all it is good for."
3,Oregon Listener,"I Like Won-G but why buy the same cd! Won-G's other cd ""No Better Than This"" has the same track's on it, the only difference is the cd cover and 1 extra track. I purchased the new one ""Explosion"" and took it back for a refund. So if you already own ""No Better Than This"" save your money."
5,Great product,"I enjoy a good red wine, however I'm the only drinker and rarely would finish a bottle in one sitting. This product will help remove the air and keep the wine fresh on the shelf for a few days. Keep in mind, this only works for still wines."
4,Wine Lovin' in da Summer,I love my wine more than anyone. I like to keep it save from harm. Some people call me an alcoholic but I'm simply an alcoholenthusiast. For years I've been searchin for the perfect invention to keep my babies safe from garm. And one day my prayers were answered. Vacu plug did the trick. Each time I opened the bottle it was like the very first time. The wine stayed fresh and refreshing. I drank a little every day and everyday it was g-r-r-reat. THANK YOU GOD!
4,work well,Was not sure would work with our pump but they have been working well now for over a year. Quality rubber and it really makes a difference in wine flavor.
4,You probably need more of these,"If you have a VacuVin, you undoubtedly know the beauty of not having to finish a bottle of wine in one sitting. Having once experienced this freedom, why not enjoy more?The VacuVin comes with two stoppers, but two quicky become insufficient. It is easy to suddenly have several partially full bottles - a red and a white; but then a friend comes over and you want to share a special bottle. A couple dollars eliminates this constrait.Another reason to get more stoppers, is that they seem to loose their effectiveness over time - not keeping their vacuum seal very long. I am sometimes disappointed when I take out a ""Vacced"" bottle, squeeze the stopper, and don't hear the rush of air going into the bottle that indicated the seal held. Possibly the rubber hardens over time. One way to get more longevity out of the stoppers is to slightly wet them before using - the moisture seems to help the rubber get a good seal.4 stars only because the stoppers should last longer."
2,picture incorrect,Be careful. The picture was of the older model which was what I wanted. It came through as the newer one. Make sure it is the correct one you need.
1,Repackaged Volumes 1-3.,"This is a total rip off. The cover had 4-6, but the text was Volumes 1-3. Avoid at all costs."
2,Cheap B & W Pictures!!,"WTF?? I have not read the text so I can comment on the book per se. The pictures are awful.... cheap, grainy, black and white...very returnable!"
2,Beware of size!!,"I bought the original sierra 12 X 12 and the canopy square footage was 100 sq ft. (10 x 10) The new sierra II 12 X 12 canopy is only 9 X 9 (81 sq Ft.).Ez up is selling the ""same product"" which covers less area now for the same price as the old one. Believe me when I say that the extra foot(19 sq ft) make a difference!The 12 X 12 is measured at the base of the slanted legs and the new model legs slant a lot more"
1,Cross beam broke on first use,"The first time I set this up in the field, one of the cross members (which are supposed to be steel), broke. The metal just snapped, near one of the plastic connectors. The plastic was fine, it was the metal that broke.Other than that, it seemed a nice popup, though I agree with other reviews, it is not really a one person setup.Serious kudos to Amazon.com for making returning this item for a refund so easy and convenient!"
4,Well worth the cost,"We were surprised at the quality for the price. Ours is used along the Lake Erie shoreline where the winds can be brutal and it has been fine. You can spend alot more for the commercial grade, but for occasional use you can't go wrong."
3,a little dissapointed,I should have read the details better. The cover on the top of the shelter is not 12x12 the legs that stick out at an angle are. The top is much smaller. We were trying to match it to another 12X12 we already had and the legs going out at an angle make it very difficult to butt up against something. The size was a definate dissapointment but on the up side it was very easy to put up.
2,Cheap canopy!!,"While the frame seems to be sturdy, the tan canopy faded drastically within two weeks. I mild wind came and the canopy ripped to shreds. No storm, just mild wind. Very disappointed in the product."
4,all in all a good buy,"We wish it was quicker and easier to set up (takes several minutes with two people) and we wish it was actually 12 x 12 covered area - - base of supports is 12 x 12, not top. But, we are thrilled to have it and highly recommend E-Z up over other brands."
5,Sierra Pop Up Tent from Amazon,So far this pop-up tent has worked out real well for me. I use it for our local farmer market. I would definately recommend this product & this price is really worth the money.
5,ez-up tent,"Great for family picnics and even yard sales. Lots of uses, even if you don't tailgate. EZ to put up and take down. One person can do it, but two is better. Even goes easily back in it's storage bag. Tent is heavy but not unmanageable. Item shipped very quickly."
3,owner,"used it for a month at a swap meet; inner grey lining (really keeps out the sun) rubs off; cover tears easily; legs spread out at base quite a bit; don't believe that top is 10 ft x 10 ft, buttom may be; great sleeve to carry it around (it's pretty heavy) but logistically difficult to slip on; all in all serves purpose of keeping out the sun; one leg weak when in highest position; no better than other brands I've used except it is easier to put up."
1,Collapsed with first rain. Flimsy cheap design.,"Besides finding cheaply made frame upon removing from the bag, this thing went down in a heap of broken twisted sharp metal with the first rain. If you are familiar with those cheap curtain rods that get bent in half if you even look at them, then you know what this frame is built of. I was so impressed with the quality of the canopy top and its apparent waterproof material when first setting this up. We did a major overhaul of landscaping etc and were preparing for a garden party. Everything was so beautiful. That was till the day of the party, we awoke to a horror. The thing collapsed on everything and wet all our supplies. The frame was broken or twisted in every joint. Sharp pieces lacerated my fingers and jabbed my legs. It was a mess. There was no way to even fold up what was left of it for return."
4,Cheapest canopy you can get,"This is smaller than 10x10 but its less expensive than any other canopy. I've used mine for farmers market for a year now. We are given a 10x10 space and it fits well, providing reasonable shade. Top is easy to keep clean. I tossed the rolling bag/tote thing and just use a feed sack as a transport cover. Covering it during transport is important to keep it from getting worn or dirty. Since its a small canopy, its very light weight and easy to set up or take down. Next time I'll probably buy a true 10x10, but this was a good one to start out with."
2,EZ Up Sierra II Canopy,"I received this item in a timely fashion, in time for our beach vacation. It is fairly easy to set up and take down as long as you have two people. It is nicely made and sturdy. The biggest disappointment is the size. It is no way near 12 x 12. Since it is measured at the bottom of the legs, and the legs are very slanted, I don't think it is even 10x10. Definitely misrepresented in the description. What a disappointment. Would not recommend this item if you want a 12x12 canopy. Look for one with straight legs since that is how they measure the canopy size."
1,Weak at best,Bought E-Z UP Sierra II 12x12 in Sept 2011. Metal cross member broke while putting it up in April 2012. Quik Shade makes a much better product.
4,Very Good Design Overall,"This is my second one of these. We use it for shade at the beach. It is very easy to erect and take down, and is reasonably sturdy. I recommend it to anyone needing something for shade.The reason I need a new one is that I left the old one up during heavy rain. Rain pooled on it until it got too heavy and the shelter collapsed. So DON'T LEAVE IT UP IN THE RAIN. The old shelter was still usable, but would have required a couple of ropes and stakes to make the roof tight, and I did not want to fool with that.I noticed that another review indicated that two people are needed to handle it. I am an average-sized, not-especially-strong 67 year-old, and I have no problem handling it alone."
1,"E-Z UP, E-Z BREAK!","We were excited to have this as it has the UV protection. We practiced setting it up before our vacation. On our FIRST day, we proceeded to set it up and one of the cross struts broke! Seems pretty cheaply made & we were very, very disappointed! We saw several more set up on the beach (Port Aransas) and many had the same problem."
4,A Great Tent at an Affordable Price!,"I am a beginning DJ. I purchased this tent to use for outdoor gigs such as Lawn Parties, Block Parties etc. I am very pleased with my decision.My son and I practiced putting up the tent before I used it publically. After this initial time putting up the tent, all the other times were a cinch...This tent gives a professional look and since I am just starting my DJ business, I appreciate looking as professional as possible. Also, this tent is large enough cover all my equipment when I perform, including my speakers.I encourage anyone looking for an out door tent to purchase this E-Z UP tent. Enjoy."
3,Not so E-Z Up,"This definitely does the trick creating shade and shelter from the sun. My gripe with it is that it is not so E-Z Up. My husband agreed, and he is a strong guy, that it really takes 2 people. Not great for Mom who takes the kids to the beach and wants to set it up herself. But, once it's up, it works well and stays put."
1,Garbage,"This product is garbage. I've used other EZ-Ups and canopy tents with no problems. The first time I used this four spars broke, leaving me without shade immediately prior to an event. EZ-Up customer service was excellent, sending me replacement spars.After replacing the spars, I tried to use the product again, and again it failed, breaking the spars that I didn't replace and failing to collapse.The spars are cheap metal, and can't stand up to the negligible force of opening and closing. Two uses, two failures and two events without shade.Do not buy this product."
3,overpriced,"You can get them cheaper at Big 5. EZ-up Sierra 10x10 goes on sale for $79.99. And the 12x12 for $89.99. And as far as easy to put up and take down it's as easy as it could be. I mean you don't have to put anything together, take it out and pop it up. Get the base plates for it too."
3,Functional Canopy,"It still takes 2 people to put this canopy up. It is not that easy - but once the canopy is up, it does a good job of providing shade and shelter. We are still satisfied with our purchase."
1,Broke after 3 days,"This product is very fragile. I set it up, took about 5 minutes because it was my first time. Three days later my wife and I took it down and a cross piece popped off. I managed to repair it, but when we put it up in another location, the metal on one of the legs bent and crumpled.Now I am a very handy person and I don't mishandle products. I understand that the aluminum has to be thin the keep the product light and inexpensive, but this thing is very poorly made. I've had better luck with cheaper shades."
4,great product for the price,"I leave these up in my backyard for 3+ months over the summer, and they usually only last 1.5 years. But they're not supposed to be permanent so this makes sense.I keep buying more because they're easy to set up (need 2 people, takes only a minute or so), and are lightweight enough to easily carry down to the beach."
5,Sturdy and well made,"I was able to set this up myself in 10 minutes and it is sturdy and well made. I put 4 foot 1/2 inch rebar a foot in the ground and clamped to each pole which makes it extremely sturdy. The last one I had lasted 3 years in rain, snow and sun being up 365 days of the year. I use it to keep my car shaded. I big bang for the buck!"
1,Deceptive sizing,"I should have trusted the reviews I read regarding the size of the tent. I ordered the 10x10 and it measured about a foot smaller. I work at a lot of festivals where I set up a tent for my business. My tent was surrounded by other 10x10 tents and you can see where my tent was way smaller than the other tents. And when you have several people in the tent with you, the smaller size is very noticeable. I owned a 10x10 tent previously with no problem. I feel ripped off by the deceptive sizing of this tent."
1,"Not easy, never went up!","I purchased this product for camping, and the day before our trip, my son and I tried to set it up. Despite carefully following the instructions, we could not completely open the canopy. Three adult friends saw us struggling and came to help out, and we STILL couldn't open the canopy! After about an hour, we gave up. The joints felt extremely tight, and since we were leaving the next day, we didn't have time to call customer service or tinker with the joints, so we returned the E-Z Up."
2,Bad Luck,"We purchased this based on positive reviews for our beach trips. I will say all went well the first day. However, the next day when we went to put it up, the canopy part would not fit properly. IT SHRUNK!! I do not understand it, now we cannot fully extend the legs or the top won't fit. Crazy. I should have returned it then. It may just be a fluke. Just watch out for this."
3,Well Built but not true 10X10,"The canopy is very well built and seems very sturdy. I'm just a tad disappointed as it seems the canopy only covers around 80 sq feet and not 100 sq feet you would expect a 10X10 canopy to cover. The legs slant outward a bit to make the 10X10 footprint, the actual canopy seems to cover 9X9 or so."
4,Nick and Nora for the 21st century,"Light-hearted and witty, Paul Engleman's ""The Man with My Cat"" features wisecracking duo, narrator Phil Mooney and his writer wife, Frankie. Phil, on the outs with the Chicago political machine (see his first Moony novel, ""The Man With My Name"") has some time on his hands and only one job to do - get rid of the cat, inherited from his father, whose spraying habits have doomed him to neutering at the very least.But someone steals his unwanted cat from the vet's office and then someone murders the vet. There's a lot of personality and politics before getting to this point and some slapstick and quick thinking in getting to the solution. The mystery is fun but the star attractions here are Phil and Frankie and Engleman's clever, sparkling writing."
4,Giddiness for the Mathematically Fastidious,"I picked up _Sliceforms_ in England, and got it home without much ado. However, on a bored Saturday night in October, I constructed my first Sliceform. The ""slices"" are extremely detailed templates, and cutting has to be exact, but when I completed the 'Form by sliding the cuts onto one another, I was amazed and perplexed. This three-dimensional shape can be folded onto itself in a synesthetically pleasing way. I carry my Sliceform with me whenever I sense I might get bored -- or need a handy conversation-starter! _Sliceforms_ is pretty easy to understand and a great joy to experience, especially if one is as detail-oriented as I. The only drawback is the less-than stellar explanations if you're not hugely geometrically inclined."
5,Give before you receive.,"Rolling Thunder always gave from his change purse before he took anything from nature and was always abundantly rewarded for his effort! I was picking black berries and thought of Rolling Thunder giving before he took. I found I had no change with me, so I decided to give one of every four berries by throwing one to the ground. My three sons were picking on the other side of the berry patch using one quart baskets. I had a twelve quart aluminum pan. After giving, I picked over twelve quarts of berries, while my sons had only one inch of berries on the bottom of their baskets. When I walked around the end of the patch and the boys saw all I had picked, by my self, their eyes got as big as sauceres! I learned that day, that what Doug Boyd observed many times, certain truths work for us all!"
2,Customer Support is Pathetic,"I've used this product for a few years and it's pretty much done what I've needed it to do, with a few manageable glitches here and there. I made the mistake of upgrading to the newer version a month ago; that's when the problems started. My sites freeze, crash, and do all sorts of weird things. I've written to them numerous times--they do respond but it's gone on for weeks with no resolution. I've asked them to call me, or give me a number to call them, but they say they ""don't offer phone support"". What? They don't have a telephone?If I ran my company like they do, I'd be out of business. They make it hard to be their customer. I used to be a loyal customer--until I had a problem. I'm going to go elsewhere."
1,Do Not Buy if you have a Web Site,If you already have one or more web sites do not buy Site Spinner.Site Spinner uses a proprietary format and does not allow you to import existing web sites.If you are a fan of open source stay away from this product.
4,Intuitive,"Sitespinner is easy to use, intuitive, and really thorough (it can do pretty much anything you want). I downloaded a trial and bought within a day."
4,A review for customer support,"The product itself is very good. It has some annoying features that make an otherwise brilliant package a pain to use sometimes. I hope that as new releases and updates are made available the problems will get less. The review is more about Virtual Mechanics customer service. It is brilliant. They're prompt, helpful and accurate. With that kind of support you can forgive the occasional ""program feature"" safe in the knowledge that whatever the problem, it will be sorted."
4,Fast Customer Service,"When I had difficulty starting up the software, the customer service sent the correct information within a few hours. This is something I do not generally receive from anyone. I rate the customer service as a five-star service.SiteSpinner is good software. Some complain of not being able to import HTML but I find cut and paste work just as easily as importing code. This software is, in my opinion, for intermediate or advanced HTML programmers and webpage designers. I do not recommend it for beginners unless they are willing to sit for several hours to learn how to use it. Everything has a learning curve to it. SiteSpinner works well for me when I use it in conjunction with other HTML editors. I do like its ability to manipulate images and create logos for websites. I always recommend this software."
4,"Functional, Robust Program . . . and a little Quirky","This is my first and only Web Building program. Sitespinner has supplied free upgrades steadily since I bought the first version seven years ago. Not all functions are intuitive, but they are all there. So with a little bit of stick time; you'll be able to create almost any page you'd like. The embedded text editor noted elsewhere is an annoyance. But one gets used to having a text editor or word processor close at hand. I've found product support to be excellent. The user forums are well laid out, and closely monitored by ""super users"" from inside and outside of the company. Other users also seem enthusiastic about the program and community, and are eager to help. Recommended."
2,Get designer- won't launch!,"I really like the wysiwyg editor on this product. Unfortunately neither I nor my (major) webhost can figure out how to put the site on my domain! Sadly, there is no support to help with this. I am afraid that I lost my money and my time in working on this."
2,"Newbies, avoid this program It is as represented and that is both good and bad!","I have had some troubles getting started with my website and was looking for something I could use. I found my web hosting service built in horrid so I got this in the hope it might be helpfulFirst, it is exactly what they say, a drag and drop interface for making a web page. And that is about it. Very few extras, as near as I can tell, not even any code shortcuts for say, making a link to an external page, or perhaps an email address URL.It is exactly as represented but you better know at least a little of coding or you are done with this.If your web programming consists of mostly dragging and dropping items into a web page making program, there is no better program than this for this purpose. But if you are newby, hoping to find something that helps you get going easily and quickly, better move on. It is just too bare bones"
4,Sitespinner Software,"The software is much more complex and full of options that I didn't need, I just wanted to get a simple website up for a charity I volunteer for. On the upside, it appears to have great growth potential for those wanting more. I'm overall satisfied with the product."
5,Pagespiner,"I just downloaded this program.....WOW! I was using Microsoft Publisher, what a hunk a junk Microsoft is compared to this thing. Its as easy as pie. And no, nobody paid me to say that.....it really is great. This program can make ""Web developers"" very nervous....its almost like we can be them....almost!"
2,Give it a try...,"My last review was a little harsh, this program works and is stuffed full of useful tools,(the circle and text tools are cool). Wish I had learn to work in this before I used frontpage.but alas I had to go back to frontpage, I can do pages in my sleep. What I really need is an upgraded photo editor."
2,if the tutorials were not so confusing...,I have some webpage HTML experience but couldn't understand the tutorials enough to gain from the ease of the use of the software. Also I don't think it has enough templates nor enough variety of templates. Overall I could say it does have the capability to make a nice looking webpage despite the shortfalls.
1,Run away!,"Terrible, might be easy for a beginner, but you cannot import standard formats (like html) to edit, or improve. There are free ones about, and many a lot cheaper that work better."
1,The worst web building software I've ever used,"There are so many glitches in this software, it'll make you go mad trying to get it to do what you're trying to get it to do. I've built many websites myself, writing them myself in HTML. I figured I'd take the easy way out and get a site building program to do it for me. I'll never make that mistake again. Either get a MUCH better product, or learn HTML yourself. It'll be easier in the long run. I've spent over 2 weeks just trying to get all of the website uploaded to the web because of irronious code this program has put in, so in reality, I'm back to trying to rewrite the site myself using HTML. ARGHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
3,Good product,This is much easier to use than Front Page & dramatcally easier than MS Web Expression for people who don't know HTML. I also tried CoffeeCup but it didn't seem as capable as SiteSpinner. SS is NOT nearly as easy and bullet-proof for beginners as some of the proprietary editors built in to the big web hosting sites like Network Solutions or Yahoo.My biggest complaint with SS is the text editor is not WYSIWG and doesn't perform like all microsoft apllications when is comes to CUT & PASTE.
1,Wrong tool for publishing an HTML newsletter!,"This is a non-frame-based tool. It doesn't have the concept of editing text in a table. Yes you can create a table. To put text into a cell of the table, you create the table, then create a separate text object, save that text object, then resize that text object, then drag that object into the table cell and hope that it fits. God forbid that you want to edit backgrounds or size of font. This tool is only fine if you're doing VERY simple design. DO NOT BUY THIS TOOL IF YOU WANT TO PUBLISH A NEWSLETTER!!!If you cut and paste the HTML into a publishing tool, the imbedded objects do NOT retain their positions. In other words, What You See Is NOT What You Get!"
2,Leon sings Sinatra??????,"Leon Russell has been on a born again crusade by releasing several cd's this year on his own label. His latest release ""Moonlight and Love Songs"" is another attempt to be MR. Versatility? It does not work on this one. Leon can do many things, he is a multi-talented musician and singer. After giving this cd a listen, you will see that he should have left the lead vocals to Tony Bennet. Leon is better at rock, gospel and blues and should avoid making cd's with pop standards and fake orchestras. Old time Leon fans are going to find this one hard to digest?"
2,"Interesting idea, ""but""...","... disappointing. For this record to work it needed a lot more imagination in the orchestral arrangemnts, they become just some pleasant but tepid and flat sonic wallpaper behind Leon's voice. He has released a lot of new music lately, if you're looking for newer stuff, ""Guitar Blues"" is a much more inspired effort. If you're new to Leon Russell, your collection should start with ""Leon Russell and the Shelter People"" or the great ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"" (Joe Cocker's record but Leon steals the show.) This record of standards is just for the completist who wants to own the entire Leon Russell catalog."
5,Audi Sign is great,The Audi Parking sign I ordered was fabulous.....it is posted permanently in my garage now!
4,Looks Great!,"Looks great, arrived on time....it's all good in the hood. I bought it for my audi fan and he loves it!"
4,Love it -- except for the noise!,"We have only had this machine at home for a week, but the two batches of ice cream we have made so far have been wonderful. The first was the vanilla out of the recipe book and the second was a dulce de leche that I made up. Both were excellent. My wife, who normally can take or leave ice cream, said, ""Is this what ice cream is supposed to taste like?"" Fresh ingredients and this capable machine would seem to be the secret.I gave the unit 4 stars because it is quite loud in operation. The noise is really the only drawback we have encountered thus far."
5,Love it,I love this ice cream maker. I've been making ice cream for years with the ice and salt mess so you gotta know how wonderful this is for me. It is a little loud but I simply put it in another room and close the door. I've made several different recipes and loved them all. This machine is so convenient. And I love it that I don't have to remember to put a big container in my limited freezer space. This is the best!
3,Minnesota Charlie,"I have been looking at this unit for 6 months or more before I place the order and I was convinced it would be great for the family. We tried several recipes and the results are fair or less. We didn't like the yogurt recipes at all. The ice cream recipes are OK but for the most part nobody was excited nor did we rave about the ice cream. We elected to return to the local store and buy our favorites brands again. Amazon was great, I explained our experience with the product and they said if were not pleased to send it back for a full refund. Thank Amazon."
4,FUN for little ones,I like this drawing set and so does my 3 year old. She will spend long periods of time playing with the different marker colors and areas of the drawing board.The only problem is the case for the markers is difficult for her to open and close; not very secure.
5,A very dense and straightforward book on innovation,"I am a frequent reader on books, especially on the subject of innovation, and I have often noticed how the reader readily can browse through the volume filling pages that the author has put in to reach the level of 256 pages or whatever he is paid for. This book is unbrowsable - every page is filled with readworthy items and it is quite easy to transform the findings to your own company. This book fits well with the first part of an IRI project seen in the book ""Radical Innovation and how companies can outsmart upstarts"" as well as with the article in the Research & Technology Management magazine from IRI (Jan/Feb 2005) ""Building a radical innovation competency"" covering the four subsequent years of the project."
3,Why Is Keith Emerson On This CD?,"This is a potentially great compilation ruined by the La Chiesa tracks that have Keith Emerson on them. Not that the tracks are bad; far from it. But this a GOBLIN collection, not a Keith Emerson collection. The point I'm trying to make is that there's a wealth of material that Goblin has recorded that's not issued over here in the U.S.; the Volo album, Perche' Si Uccidono, the Libra soundtracks, etc. One of the reasons why they're not here might be licensing restrictions. What is here aside from La Chiesa are tracks from the Roller album which are excellent and tracks from the film Squadra Antigangsters which have their moments. (You can read my review of the Squadra Antigangsters soundtrack for more information on it.) Hopefully, if there are future volumes of this series DRG won't repeat this mishap."
1,Formula 405 AHA Cream -- Yuck!,This was an early experiment in alpha hydroxy acid. It severely burned my skin and turned it a deep red within a minute of applying. Stick with the traditional Formula 405 Enriched Face Cream. It's great!
1,Use Caution!,I read this book many times as a child. The way the topic of Armageddon is presented ( where God destroys even the littlest ones) and the denial of Christs diety are reasons parents should think carefully before sharing this with their children.
5,Free,"Awesome book I agree, they are free in every Kingdom Hall in the world - donations of course welcome (fyi)"
5,Wonderful Book,"I would first off like to point out that the mentally challenged person who posted the picture fails to mention that this image is not FROM the My Book of Bible Stories publication. It is taken from a completely different publication, and is even then taken out of context.The actual My Book of Bible Stories is, and has been, a fantastic book for reading to children. It introduces them to the Bible, the people and places therein, and the HOPE that can be gained from reading it, all in a simple language that appeals to young ones. I recommend it for any parent who looks for chances to read to/with their little ones."
4,Spooky,"Fun and spooky, to bad it didn't continue for more than just those few episodes. Blah Blah Blah blah blah"
2,It's interesting in theory but falls short in living up to potential,"This is an interesting storyline set in an intriguing and potentially engaging environment (the Amazon). The characters lack individual story motivation and seem one dimensional. What was lacking was a more thorough and realistic integration of the already intriguing elements surfacing in the Amazon jungle and rivers . . . these mysteries alone would have served as the seeds of some incredible plot points. I wanted this to be so much more than it was. I would recommend FRINGE and PERSON OF INTEREST or WAREHOUSE 13 as excellent choices for the type of intrigue, character development, and intrigue that cement stories in your imagination."
5,awesome show!,love the imagery of the shaman angel wings. i have seen and read alot on shamans there is magic out there.
1,spook busters,so why not be honest and call this ghost busters 3 amazon. if i were part of this family i would be embarrassed. this is the kardashians' unleashed. if they were plumbers i would probably? believe it.
2,The River - Episode 1,I was disappointed with the series. Watched a couple of episodes and it just fell flat. Not very interesting and I wouldn't watch anymore.
4,A great story on many levels with many practical uses.,This story is an amazingly absorbing adventure that teaches children about the meaning of friendship and putting differences aside in the name of friendship. It even shows how two animals who are ordinarily in a predatory relationship can still be friends. This ties into friendship between children of different backgrounds and interracial relations in general. The numerous illustrations throughout the book captured the facial expressions of the characters perfectly. A great transitional book for ages 7-9.
3,"Limited, but decent product","I got this product because I was fed up with having to throw away a perfectly good half bottle of wine just because my company couldn't finish it. One reviewer said the ideal way to save wine would be to put it in a smaller bottle and re-cork it. I don't know about you, but I don't tend to have smaller bottles just lying around, and even if I did, I could just imagine the mess now. This product works perfectly well for several days (as compared to just re-corking and refrigerating), but be warned. After several days, it will become just as undrinkable as re-corked wine would be after one. However, if you just want to split a bottle of wine between two evenings, I recommend this product. It's served me well within its limits."
4,A good purchase for moderate wine drinkers,"This product is a winner for my family. We love wine and tend to have a glass with dinner, or to unwind in the evening, but we rarely polish off a full bottle in one evening. Most red wine won't even last a day if it is simply recorked, but with Vacu Vin we have had a bottle of red wine last four days without a change in flavor. We have never kept one longer than four days, so it may keep longer than that if sealed properly. It is very simple to use and works. I recommend that you buy extra stoppers."
2,"The ""Featured Reviews"" are kind,","this gadget doesn't work that well. True, it takes some of the air out, maybe as much as half, but that still leaves half the oxygen IN, spoiling the wine at a slower rate--2-4 days at best instead of 1-2. NOT the two weeks Madeiline Miller quotes. To really preserve the wine, try the inert gas cans $9 for 120 shots, less than ten cents per use, and they will keep wine fresh for two weeks or more. They are what the restuarants in Napa and Sonoma are using. I do like the Vacu Vin canister sets though, they keep moisture out well."
5,Works great for short term wine storage,"The vacu-vin works well for the price and for what it was designed to do....save wine for short periods of time (1-3 days) after a bottle is opened. It is NOT an industrial vacuum re-sealer, or designed to completely thwart the oxidation process. For the perfection-minded, get a nitrogen system if you have extremely valuable wines you need to save for long periods. The rest of us will do fine using this. One tip: when you first get the stoppers, you'll notice that they say ""press"" on the top. You need to pinch the stoppers once at those spots, in order to open them so that the vacuum will work. And it takes about 15-20 pumps for the vacuum to work it's best."
2,doesn't do much,"I got this at a grocery store thinking it would be great since I only drink a little bit of wine or sake at a time.I ended up giving it away to goodwill after a few months because it doesn't really help the wine or sake (at least not for weeks like I'm prone to need between glasses) and it is annoying to use the plastic thingy, trying to get it tight and worrying that you're going to break the bottle.I think a nice reusable cork kind of gadget would do just as good a job, take up less drawer space, and look prettier in the bottle."
5,wine saver,"Fantastic. I have been using Vacu Vin products for years now and love them so much I have been giving them as Christmas presents the last several years. The wine saver is easy to use and does a very fine job extracting the air from your bottle. The same ""plunger"" is used on the marinator and a coffee keeper. I have not found a better keeper for products that benefit from a vacuum."
4,Works great!,Thls wine saver is easy to use and will definitely keep wine for an extended period. Works considerably better than another product I had tried.
1,"Don't waste your money, these are hit or miss at best","I love good Italian wine, but try to limit myself to one glass a day for health reasons. I purchased this gadget at a local wine store and assumed that meant it was useful. That was a big mistake!This gadget doesn't do anything including seal the wine in the bottle when stored on its side in the wine cellar. Some of the time a bottle on its side won't leak, but it is just a likely to leak. I tried buying another set of stoppers and having my husband seal them as well as myself. No change made a difference. Sometime they work, and sometime they don't.Additionally, when you buy a nice Brunello or a Super Tuscan do you really want to risk it become an expensive bottle of vinegar, I don't.I purchased the wine stoppers for my foodsaver and am much happier with those. At least they don't leak. Although I do finish the bottle as quickly as possible just to sure."
5,Essential!,"I have just purchased this as a gift for wine-loving friends. I have owned a Vacu-Vin for years and find it an absolutely essential item in my life. It keeps wine fresh for days--that is, if you should have some left over."
4,Wine Stopper Tool,"The tool works as advertised, unfortunately we never leave an open bottle of wine around long enough to tell whether or not the tool actually keeps it fresh."
5,Save the wine,"I have used this outfit for years and it works wonderfully well. If you buy the big 1.5 liter bottles of wine, you will save money and can keep it fresh with this item. Simple and effective. Takes a little pump, pump, pumping, but you can use the exercise. Hint: if you rub a tiny bit of oil (like canola, or some other light oil) inside the pump on occasion, it will work much smoother."
5,Excellent for the Solo Wine Drinker,"Anyone who drinks wine regularly will love this set. It is especially good for people who only drink 1 or 2 glasses a day and can't possibly finish an entire bottle in one sitting. The airtight system will ensure that the wine keeps its freshness and full flavor. Finally, the days of trying to push the cork back into the bottle are over. A great gift."
1,new style stoppers don't work,"this company had a decent product. it worked pretty well. then, for a reason only they know, the company changed the style of the stopper - the part that goes into the bottle.the new stoppers do not work! i used the old stoppers for wine and for coffe. the new ones are useless. the old style stoppers were more cylindrical and had more vanes. the mechanism did create a good seal and a good vacuum. the air stayed out of the bottle. the new ones are ""tapered"" with one vane that doesn't touch any part of the bottle. the new ones don't create much of a vacuum and air creeps in within a very short time.i've called the company and requested a refund.i can't understand why they'd take a product that worked and turn it into one that didn't. (i'll bet the marketing department had something to do with it.) they were fools. but i'll be looking elsewhere this kind of product."
1,vacu-vin wine saver...doesn't.,"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and THE WINE SPECTATOR both reviewed Vacu-Vin years ago and found that nothing claimed was true. The product does remove the bouquet (volatile esters...got to have them to taste the wine), but not the oxygen (which was the point in the first place). According to TWSJ, and TWS...drink it, or just put the cork in it because the gimmick does not save wine.People that use them think they work because they typically finish the bottle in a day,or two. Young wines will do pretty well generally without help...but the loss of bouquet will be evident if you suck it out."
2,"It's not a cheat, but...","I tried this system several years ago, It will extend the flavor of wine for a little while, but as has been mentioned in the previous entry, there is still some oxygen let in the bottle that will allow the wine to oxidize. A much better solution is to buy a can of compressed nitrogen to cover the surface of the wine and keep it from the oxygen. You still need to cork the bottle and keep it upright during storage.You can also use the gas layer storage method on oils, single malt scotch, etc."
3,"Good product, wrong solution","I can't say that this is a bad product, because it does what it purports to do -- it removes the extraneous air from your half-empty wine bottles. The problem is that removing all the air from your half-empty wine bottles is not the solution to drinking unspoiled wine all the time. Removing oxygen that causes oxidation is a noble idea, but the fact is that the remaining oxygen in the wine will escape into the vacuum, taking the flavor compounds with it, and could leave the wine less flavorful.If we're determined to leave the remaining wine in the original bottle, we should be injecting inert gas into the air space above the wine, so that it won't interfere with the wine anymore. The easier solution is just to eliminate that air space altogether by putting your wine in a smaller bottle if you haven't finished drinking it. It should keep in there for months just fine."
5,Very pleasantly surprised,"I was very pleased to see that the Vacu Vin works VERY easy - and keeps the wine stored very nicely. I had purchased another type of wine saver earlier in the year and it was very difficult to use and ended up breaking within 2 days, plus it was very expensive. The Vacu Vin is priced great and works very easy. A few quick ""pumps"" and the air is out and when you want to pour another glass of wine it is very easy to release the tab, pour and then pump it again, if needed. I am going to give the Vacu Vin as a gift with a bottle of wine to some of my friends for Christmas. I would definitely recommend this item."
5,It works!,"We use our vacu vin wine saver all of the time since purchasing it about six months ago. It enables us to put partially full bottles back into our wine cooler, which we were unable to do before. We had tried unsuccessfully to do this with other wine corks."
3,Vacu Vin v. gas replacement,"While it's most likely true that gas replacement is a more effective way to displace oxygen in a bottle of wine, the engineer's hilarious abuse of the the Vacu Vin may yet have less merit than first thought. Even a small vacuum will reduce the partial pressure of oxygen over the wine, and this may have significant effect on the oxidation reaction. I don't really know, but a chemist would. Another way to counteract spoilage would be to package the wine in a container whose volume shrinks with use, like the bladder-in-a-box."
5,Preserve your wine an extra day or two inexpensively,"These stoppers are fantastic for preserving open bottles of wine for a couple of days. The hand pump removes some (but not all of the air) from the bottle slowing the oxygentation of the wine. Since the pump does not create a perfect vacuum, the fuller the bottle the longer the wine will preserve. Although the rubber corks lose some of their ability to keep air out after a few thousand uses (quicker in dry climates), this product is so simple to use and cheap that it will pay for itself after preserving only a couple of bottles!"
2,Not as advertised,"BEWARE: this is NOT exactly as advertised. It is NOT 3 pieces. Amazon's product features say: ""Includes 1 sturdy plastic pump and 2 high-quality rubber stopper."" This is not true. It only comes with on stopper. Annoying, but not worth the trouble of returning this and getting the black version, sold by Amazon rather than just through them, that appears to really come with two, for a few cents more."
4,good stopper,"I've been using this for a couple of years and bought extra stoppers -- if you're keeping a couple of bottles open, and washing the used stoppers, you'll want three or four. As most reviews note it allows horizontal storage, and, yes, it gives you a little more time to drink the bottle before it turns.Really, this one is a no-brainer: if you don't finish the bottle you need to put some kind of stopper in it, right? This is way better than trying to jam the cork back in."
4,Wine? Don't know...but for juice its perfect,"I drink much more juice than wine, and found that these savers are the perfect supplement to anyone making homemade juices. Instead of a fridge life of 2 days, you can extend the life of fresh fruit juices to at least 5 days. Basically, less oxygen (and a tighter seal) leads to a slower breakdown. Definately worth the $6 I paid for this set."
5,An essential item when you don't want to drink it all now,"This is a great tool for anyone who likes wine. I use mine all the time. It does preserve wine well and is quite easy to use, but I would encourage you to get extra stoppers and to use only Vacu Vin brand. I've found that other brands don't always work very well.For red wines at optimal drinking age, don't rely on the vacu vin for more than 1-2 days, 3 at most (and that will be too much for some). You may find that younger wines even benefit from a few days. This is worth trying if you open a bottle and find you don't like it. Or, if it's that bad, preserve it for cooking.Enjoy!"
5,The best wine saver I have found!,"If you truly want a easy to use wine saver that works this is the one to buy! It is the only one that I have found that keeps my open bottles of wine from spoiling. My friends have loved receiving them as house warming gifts too! This is one product that has live up to it's name ""Wine Saver!"""
4,Works well; not really convinced it does much,"I don't finish a typical bottle of red wine for about a week, so anything I can do to keep it fresh seems sensible. Basic chemistry tells me that a vacuum will help with that, although I'm not convinced that this creates enough of a vacuum to make much difference. Keeping wine in the fridge is much more effective (if you don't mind cold red wine), so I do both, and am pretty happy with that. Also, it's a lot easier than trying to replace certain types of corks."
5,Keeps wine fresh,"I'm really happy with this product. I'm the only one in the house who drinks wine, so I always talk myself out of opening a bottle because I'm afraid it will go bad before I get a chance to drink it all. The wine saver really seems to work. Now I don't hesitate to open a bottle of wine, even if I only want half a glass. I wish I had bought it years ago."
4,Never waste another bottle of wine,"It's not often a full bottle of wine is finished in one night at my house as we tend to drink beer more than wine. In the past I would struggle to get the cork back into the bottle to save it for another night. Of course I was not always successful and several times ruined what was left by getting pieces of cork into the wine. Recently at a friends house I saw her using the Vacu Vin Wine Saver and realized I needed one myself. I found them here on Amazon and at the time it was included in the 4-for-3 promotion so it was a great deal. Since receiving it I have had the chance to use it twice and it couldn't be easier to use. I see that you can buy extra stoppers, but for me two is plenty. Color didn't matter to me, but if you prefer it also comes inBlack."
5,Best Pump,I have tried a few of these from local kitchen stores but this is by far the best. holds a seal until you open it.
5,good,Great video too bad Duke lost. Why in the world should duke ever lose to kentucky?? Not ever!! Go Duke!
5,UK's Fifth National Title Win is All Here!,"For UK basketball fans, this disk is a must have! From tipoff to final buzzer, the 1978 title game versus Duke is all here! Watch Jack Givens score 41 points in a dazzling display that still stands as one of the great performances of all time! There are no extras on the disk, and the video transfer betrays the age of the source material, but this is a great disk, a great game, and a great basketball team! You won't be disappointed!"
4,Excellent overview,"This is an excellent way to review the key themes and ideas of not only this era, but any era. Clear and concise, I found it very helpful. It is weak on biography, but you can't expect them to cover everything. On occasion, I wished they could be more expansive, but it's a tough book to write. They've had to make choices. Unfortunately, on occasion, these were not the choice I would made. Still 4 stars out of five."
5,A voice that calls to you...,"I remember walking along Cedar Springs in Dallas, and I heard this voice on the wind. A little searching and there she was - Deborah Vial. She was performing outside on the patio at Sue Ellen's, and her whiskey-smooth and cigarette-rough voice had the crowd spellbound. I stood transfixed as she sang ""Make a move... any move... I know it will be the right one... make a move.""Wow. This woman delivers the goods, believe me. When she does release her full-length CD, this is one fan that will be first in line to buy it!"
2,Nice voice poor songs,"She has a nice voice but with only 5 songs, this is a poor reflection of her talent. She shines on the cover song but the originals lack polish. Maybe another effort will show if she is more than just another girl singer. There are lots of nice voices. Give us good songwriting."
2,hysteria in the other direction,"This book is OK, but Fraser did not do her homework. She lumps ALL diet plans together as more or less bad, and completely ignores any scientific evidence surrounding any diet. When she wants to deride a diet, she quotes some doctor. She dismisses low-carb dieting, but conveniently ignores the compelling hormonal and biochemical evidence.If you want to get angry about dietary snake-oil salesmen, this book is for you. It's unclear what the book is ABOUT, though, especially since the author doesn't have a prescription of her own beyong eating natural, unprocessed food."
1,Not Great,"I've always heard great things about Donald Goines. If they are true, they are not fairly represented in Street Players. This book reminded me that I should not be an author; because AVERAGE WRITING is not worth the time it takes to read it, or write it.-alan"
4,street players,"The 4th title I've read by Goines...regrettably one of his weaker efforts. The story ended so abruptly I believe the author was being hounded by his publisher or needed some heroin (Goines was addicted for many years) or both. Still some of the descriptions of steeet life were quite raw and vivid, reminding me of Whoreson or Dopefiend, two of his more vital efforts. An easy read, but one of his lesser constructions."
3,ok,It seems to not plow the way the boys thought it should. But after a little time it seemed to work better
5,great toy,Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas and he loves it. Excellent quality and would definitely recommend this toy.
5,very thorough and well made,"this book was highly recommended by the person who was teaching me korean and i must say it is very helpful, i was kind of skeptical because of the negative review somewhere below here that the book i would be receiving wasn't the one pictured.but when i got the book it was the correct one with the green cover as pictured."
2,"continues, but leaves out alot","This book finishes where book one left off with more advanced grammar and vocabulary. However, the included cd only covers the dialogue, leaving the example sentences with no audio examples, which is unfortunate. There are cheaper and better audio courses available. For example, the Kanada course comes with five audio cds and runs only $20. This course also covers more territory and grammar. So for about the same price as continuing Korean with postage, you could get four books and 16 cds from the Kanada course. Try that instead."
2,Wrong cover,"If you are hoping for the nice white and blue book you will not receive it. Instead you will receive a grayish-green textbook from back in 2002. This is my second attempt at sending the textbook to get the book that is advertised above. It is the same book as far as content, but it is an older version. I did email amazon the first time I was sent the wrong book. They said they would resend the right one, but it is the same wrong covered book again. It is like asking for an apple but instead you get an orange."
5,"Hey kids, its monopoly time.","This is the best monopoly game ever. If you are a simpsons fan,or if you are looking for something that will be more fun than regular monopoly, this is a must own."
4,christmas,this is a christmas gift that my grandson wanted and was pleased I could find itfor him he enjoys playing board games
5,There is a God,I collect Monopoly board games. This is by far the most beautiful Monopoly game ever. If you are a Simpson fan that's a bonus. The board features almost every place in Springfield from the Kwik-E-Mart to Mr. Burns Manor. You could spend hours looking at every little and totally hilarious details. The game tokens are very nice plus you have the option to purchase other limited edition game tokens which are very cool by the way. The property deeds are a work of art. And on plus side if you have children and want to interest them in math and strategy while having fun you can not go wrong with this one. One more thing; if you do deside to purchase this game and plan on using it you better buy more than one or you will find yourself making your friends wash their hands before they could even think of touching it. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Have fun.
4,Game Tokens a Letdown,"The Simpson Monopoly gameboard is everything I had hoped for. All of the classic Monopoly sites are now labeled with various places featured in the Simpsons show. However, I was very unhappy to find that the pewter game tokens lack the characters of Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Mr.Burns. In order to aquire these tokens the company asks that you order them for an extra $10. This is a great piece to have for any Simpsons fan who doesn't mind paying extra for, what I consider, key components to the game or the player who can be content without them. Overall, the gameboard makes up for the lack of main character game tokens."
4,Fun Simpsonesque customizing makes Monoploy more fun,"Without going on too long, it's Monopoly. The cards are changed only enough so that the characters from the show are depicted, but the chance and community chest cards' text/instructions are no different than the classic game. That was a disappointment.However, the board and tokens are enough to get a true Simpsons fan to love this edition. The richly drawn board takes you all over Springfield, with amusing little goings-on on the surface. Overall, it's little different from the regular game, once you take out the incredible richness of being involved in the Simpsons'crazy world."
3,"Interesting little story, but not much to come for","It's really more of an anecdote on how much trouble buying a horse in 18-something America can be. It's a worthwhile read if you're interested in the period, but not if you want advice on how to buy a horse."
2,Nowhere near as good as the chillout annual 2002,"THis is not very good.It's a collection of random songs, many of which are not even very chilled-out. They are not mixed together at all.Don't buy this, spend the extra $$$ on the 2002 version."
5,"Communicates the ""Difficult to Communicate""","Great book for this election year. Being a communication specialist myself, I understand the struggles people go through to express themsevles on important, emotional issues--without losing their cool and muddying the message. If you find yourself in this position (or others of your friends or family find themselves lacking for words), this book could be the answer. It thoughtfully outlines both the Republican and Democratic points of view on the tough issues--clearly, concisely, and compellingly."
4,Nature Gone Mad,"I first read the story of the Peshtigo fire in Vincent Gaddis's fortean classic, ""Mysterious Lights & Fires"". This only allowed a minute glimpse into this remarkable natural disaster of 1871. The authors have done an excellent job at bringing the personal stories of those that lived and died in the face of mind numbing terror. I only wish they had explored in more detail the meterological and environmental conditions in the region that led to this malestrom of fire. Social history at it best. Recommended."
5,very interesting,knowing alittle about the area I found it very informative and interesting. Not one page of boardom.We view our forests differently today
5,Intelligent and Astonishing,"The extraordinary ""voice"" of the fire that took the lives of thousands of people in the town of Peshtigo, Wisconsin still thunders in my head. The historical events of this book and the well researced weather patterns that led up to the deadliest fire in American History is at once compelling and fasinating to witness in print."
4,catastrophe brought vividly to life on the page.,"roughly the first 2/3rds of this book are completely compelling. the time and place are brought to life with complete narrative mastery. the horror of this event becomes a page-turning thriller as the authors build the scene page by page into the nightmare catastrophe which is the climax. the only reason i give this 4 stars instead of 5, is because the last part of the book deals with the relief efforts that follow the fire, and they are simply not that interesting. do not let that small quibble of mine deter you from reading this book, however. it is a fascinating read."
3,Should have been a longer book,"I expected a book about the firestorm and what happened during that tragedy to the people involved. Instead, I got a history of several wealthy men, some brief information about local inhabitants and a rather quick overview of the fire sweeping through the area. It's an interesting look at Wisconsin, the lumber industry and the slash and burn techniques used (Hey, aren't we yelling at people in South America for doing the same thing?) but I expected more than I got. I also realized when I finished that I still didn't understand very well what happened to create the firestorm. So I reread that section and I still don't understand. I wish they had done more research and written a longer book."
3,check the numbers !,"Firestorm at Peshtigo, by novelist Denise Gess, and Professor William Lutz, purportedly ""tells the human, political, and scientific story behind America's deadliest fire.""The book is an interesting and seemingly well-documented read about a natural disaster otherwise little known except to forest historians. However, it contains some very non-scientific information about forestry. In the Notes for Chapter 1, they use ""an average of approximately 640 trees in a square(sic) acre"" to conclude the Peshtigo forest as being ""far denser than any forest in the U.S. today"", and that ""the estimate of 1 billion trees destroyed is no exaggeration"". Then a photograph facing page 141 of, apparently, a multi-stem clump of hardwood (elm?) stumps in a cementary, ""reveals the size of the 1 billion trees destroyed"", which are generally described as virgin white pines.These statements are not factually supportable and could have been easily vetted by a number of the cited bibliographic sources."
2,Firestorm at Peshtigo-A social history,"This book is an good social history of the Peshtigo area in 1871. Given the source material that is available from that time period is an adequate narrative. It does not really talk about the fire behavior that may have occurred. I'm not sure if the authors intended to discuss fire behavior but they kept referring to ""gustnados"" as the explanation. Their bibliography and references include a few older references on fire behavior. If you are reading this book because of the wildland fire angle, you will be disappointed."
1,Firestorm at Peshtigo,"I have never written a review before, but, This is the worst book I have ever read, please save your money and your time."
2,Useless and High Level Information,"This book provides such useless information such as the numerology of your baby's birthday and games to play at showers. As an first time expectant mother, this book provided very high level information that was inadequate. The only good thing I got out of it was what to take to the hospital for me and the new baby."
1,Don't bother...there are much better books out there!,"I got this as a hand-me-down from a friend. After reading, it I'm pretty sure I know why she didn't want to hang on to it for her next child. There is nothing in the book that was even remotely helpful to me. I would highly recommend that you buy Baby Bargains instead. It is a comprehensive guide for new parents detailing what you do and do not need for your little one. Baby Bargains is not only cheaper, but you'll get a heck of a lot more use out of it that you would from this book."
1,bad information,"I saw this book at a store and thumbed through it. It recommends that Babies sleep on their SIDES using a side positioner. This is erroneous information. The National Institute of Health recommends ( and has for almost 12 years) that babies be placed on their BACKS with NO extra bedding, pillows or paraphernalia in the crib. ( unless a doctor, for medical reasons, recommends otherwise). SIDS is the #1 cause of death for babies under 1 year of age. Safe sleeping practices should warrant more space in a baby book than the incorrect sidebar in this book. It makes me wonder what other information in here is incorrect."
4,Need briefs regularly - good price,We need briefs ongoing now for Mom. These Per-fits are a quality product were a good buy; received product in reasonable time.
4,Like it,Haven't figured out how to listen to this yet but know I will like it as it has so much of the music I enjoy
3,Good but not great,"Bill Charlap's playing on this album certainly shows him to be a highly competent jazz pianist. However, in my opinion the other reviews I have read overrate his playing. Stylistically he sounds too much like a more commercial mid 1960's mainstream piano trio. To me there's something lacking in terms of both modernity and depth in his playing and from time to time he plays figures of questionable musicality. There's nothing even approaching the depth of Bill Evans or say Brad Meldhau. In fact I was just listening to a 1964 album of Denny Zeitlin who I think sounds far superior to Charlap and in some ways more modern even then. Charlap is a good player and this isnt' a bad album but there are many jazz pianists today whom I would much rather listen to."
2,"Stardust Was Good, but not THAT Good","Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today. He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences. That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars. With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars. I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else. He has made better albums."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I would not recommend this book for someone looking for personal histories of prostitutes, johns, pimps, etc. To be honest, opening the book at almost any page, one is confronted with the most tedious 'sociological' jargon: tongue-twisting sentences, theoretical analyses of 'data', 'semi-structured interview schedules'... The lack of an index is a big drawback in a book of essays: it is impossible to find the answers to the interesting-sounding questions proposed by the jacket blurb (eg. 'Is it possible for prostitutes to enjoy their work?') without becoming tired of wading through statistics and jargon. I think this is of more interest to other academics working in the same field. I like the cover though."
4,well reasearched,"Whether your a student doing reserch or a woman contemplating the profession, this book answers many questions and creates more on the topic of prostitutution and our society. Every adult should become aware and educated on this topic."
5,Eloquent Book!,"Gary Randolf has done a remarkable job of splicing natural history, Americans and psychical beauty into one great book. Traveling through time and seasons, the reader feels the words and witnesses the beauty of the Adirondack mountains. It's not just full of incredible landscape shots (both subtle and grand) but is matched with a moving narrative that warns us this island paradise will always be in danger.Time for the world to take heed, especially in a period of history when our government seems to feel that acid rain is so irreversible here, that we can actually lower emissions standards? That the damage is already done? It's not too late, and Mr. Randorf reminds us with every page."
3,Kinda cheap,This is a really cheap snare wire I know it doesn't cost much but I would recommend just spending the extra 10 bucks for a good one.
2,Dried out and irritated my skin,"I think Aveeno is decent for some things; sunscreen, their oatmeal bath packets. For anti-aging products I will look elsewhere. This cream made my skin flake off and the fragrance seemed unnecessary and gave me a headache. No thank you!"
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,I had searched for Aveeno Lifting and Firming Night Cream and was directed to this item.It doesn't seem to work as instantly as the other product.
1,Not for dry skin,"I have been using Arbonne night cream for aging skin and then I switched to Clinique youth surge for dry skin. I loved both of those. Under the recommendation of my sister and a friend, I tried this. Not only do I have to put it on THREE times before my face stops feeling dry, but the scent of roses is nauseating, especially when combined with other Aveeno products. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. You get what you pay for, apparently. Using so much, the Clinique ends up being less expensive."
1,My sensitive skin did not like this!,Very strong scent and caused reaction - red face for a few days. Gave it to a friend whose skin is not as sensitive as mine.
2,Disapointed,"I do not know what I expected, but I found the cream to be heavy, with very little absorbency. I did not expect it to ""revitalize"" my skin, but I did expect it to offer some moisturizing. Not so."
4,Pretty good,"I have been using the tablet for a month or so. It is a nicelydesigned machine, both as tablet as well as standard laptop (i.e., with keyboard). Wireless and bluetooth were surprisingly easy to configure (nice to access the web through bluetooth phone while on the road).The main flaw I can find is in the keyboard -- nice but very very delicate. I am already at the third one. Have to admit that HP tech support has been *excellent* in providing quick replacements."
1,Buyer Beware,"I just purchased one of these right here at Amazon. First surprise? No charger. Second surprise? The ""Upgraded software"" cannot be updated, i.e. PIRATED. Third surprise? The ""Upgraded software"" was too advanced for the unit, and knocked out most of the drivers. The seller has not written me back about my questions for 6 days now... What use is a tablet to me without a touch-screen, and with most of it's buttons disabled? No use at all."
1,Can I give it negative stars? It's that bad!,"What a waste of my time reading this book for my book club. It is not well-written, and is boring to boot. The main character, for whom I guess I am supposed to care about, is a well-educated, successful newscaster who is a whiny, 'crazy' woman who I wanted to slap and yell ""wake up, you fool! If you can't care about yourself, and figure out what is bothering you, why should I care and figure it out for you???"" I guess you can tell I hated this book. Sorry. Read ""Girl, Interupted"" instead."
4,Enjoyed it,"This was a tough subject that the author handled quite well. I felt empathy for Isabel, and for the most part I liked her, which for me is a necessity in a main character. The author took me inside Isabel's head and I got a good picture of depression and what it can do to a person."
1,Made ME scream,"This book has been my biggest reading disappointment this year. With such a promising plotline, and the interesting backdrop of a psych hospital I was expecting an illuminating and compassionate read. But as many others have noted, the book is full of psychiatric cliches, and the superior attitude of Isabel, the narrator, grates. Flock fails to gain compassion for any of her charaters, and while she seems to have researched the medications relevant to depression and anxiety, her portrayal of a psych hospital seems unrealistic. If Isabel is a voluntary patient, why does she have the ECT treatment? And what hospital has intense night time group therapy sessions that bring up each patient's most crucial (and confidential) issues? I also feel that Flock wormed her way out of a more complex ending - what does happen with Isabel's job and marriage? Overall a very superficial and disappointing book."
2,Are you all blind?,"I had to check on Wikipedia to make sure that Elizabeth Flock wasn't a mentally challenged person who somehow managed to write coherent sentences.I can't figure out why everyone is rallying around this book. I read the reviews and was interested, but the tone of this ""novel"" reads like a piece in a whiny 14 year-old's blog, not an acclaimed piece of fiction by a New York Times bestselling author and former ""journalist"". Whoever edited this book should be fired , and Flock needs to take an intro course in lit. I want to lock her in a room with Chuck Palahniuk for a week. Honestly, a first grader could write a better novel than this dribble.If you generally like this genre, try some books that are written with style. ""Wasted"" by Marya Hornbacher; ""Girl, Interrupted"" by Susanna Kaysen; ""She's Come Undone"" by Wally Lamb; ""Smashed"" by Koren Zailckas, or hundreds of others."
5,Hit The Mark!,"I read this book yesterday and though I think it brushed over some of the psychiatiric stuff, like ECT isn't a twice done cure. I really thought quite a lot of if was right on track. I'm glad she found relief and reality. She closed up some things she needed to. Some mind find it a little scarey, some cold find it a little too close to each of us."
3,Interesting....,"I picked this book for my psychology class.... we had to pick about that would relate to psychology and write a book report. I will admit this is not the kind of book that I would normally run and pick up. However I ended up liking the book very much.This book relates to the reality of depression among other psychological problems. Where at first I was very fustrated with the main character, towards the end I found myself feeling sympathy for her.Not a bad book.."
2,Very Disappointing,"I thought that this book was going to be a good read and something I could relate to. But I think it was only ok and there were things in it that were very unrealistic. Such as, if you commit suicide, you don't get to voluntarily admit yourself. And you sure wouldn't be allowed to go wherever you want to on the grounds. You would be in a lock down ward. And I don't think shock treatment would be given that readily without the patient's consent. I just thought it could be much better than it was."
2,"Too much similarity to Girl, Interrupted","I did enjoy this book, but throughout the book I could not help but to feel like it was all too similar to Girl, Interrupted. The story is well told and the literary style keeps you interested while the story moves quickly; however I feel if you want an original, read Girl, Interrupted."
5,A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!,"LIFE CHANGING!I was browsing books at Target the other night and ran across this book. Once I began, I was mesmerized and couldn't put it down!This book comes highly recommended by:1) A woman who has walked in her shoes2)Someone who has lacked purpose/direction after her divorce3) One who has, unfortunately, ""been there, got the t-shirt!""In fact, I couldn't put her book down until 2 am last night and am now so exhausted I realize my sentences don't make sense.Just now this, I was sad when it ended, grateful to have read it and appreciative of the insights and epiphanies she so graciously gives her readers.READ THIS BOOK!You won't be disappointed!Sincerely,Holly BerryRealtorhollyberry@frontdoorkey.com"
5,Amazing Book!,"Book about mentally ill patients, but also about life, and how it can get out of hand-and what we need to pay attention to. The characters were symbolic of people everywhere.Highly recommended!"
2,No. Sorry.,"I could not tell the difference between the names of characters in this book, mostly because Ms. Bertin chose to step outside her field of expertise and write in a pseudo-oriental style, clashing with the sort of traditional Anglo-Saxon one she established in The Last Dragonlord [heavily laced with painfully modern romance novel dialog]. It was excruciating to see this mish mash of cultures.Some people [myself included] love dragons so much that they will buy just about anything with one on the cover [which is how I ended up with this book, and its predecessor.] This, however, is not a good contribution to draconic literature."
2,Too slow and too many subplots,"Being a fan of McCaffrey's Pern, I was excited to find this series, especially given some of the other reviews of this and the Last Dragonlord. However, I could not make it past the first 50 pages because there were too many subplots and the writing was not clever enough to keep me interested. Because she frequently skips from complex subplot to complex plot, it is difficult to care about the characters."
2,What a bore!,"While there was certainly an attempt to be interesting, this book lacks the flare of its predecessor. It drones on and on, making Maurynna into a whining brat, and her would-e love Raven into a total idiot! I don't recommend this book to anyone unless they happen to have a lot of time on their hands, and nothing to do. Instead, try to hold onton the more interesting memory of The First Dragonlord."
4,Captivating!,"This was one of the most interesting books i've read in a long time. It has an interesting plot and charecters that you can relate to. I will confess though, there are times that you are really just waiting for something to happen, and the switching from one character to another could get very annoying during scenes where there is danger to a character, or when some interesting smaller plot is just forming, but all in all, this is a fascinating book that will keep you captivated for hours on end. I'm on the edge of my seating waiting for the next book in the series to come out, Bard's Oath."
2,Dragons can be a crutch if you don't really understand them,"First off, someone should explain to Joanne Bertin that she should say her characters names and the places in her book out loud and see if she can pronounce them, or if they all sound so much alike as to be confusing.Second, I think the easiest way in the world to write a fantasy novel must be to do one about a dragon or a wizard. Either of these things apparently sell. They negate the need for good characterization, good dialog, and even a good story.There were a few good moments in this book, and for that I gave it an extra star. But it is grossly overpraised."
2,"I'm sorry, Ms. Bertin","I really wanted to like this book. I like books about dragons. A lot of people like books about dragons. Unfortunately, not every book about dragons is good. This is an example.While there is some intriguing stuff in this book, on the whole the plot with the characters from the first book is not very interesting.The far eastern stuff was pretty good, although I do think it was fairly one dimensional. I wish I liked it better, because I really wanted to. I just didn't."
3,Fun...,"Very fun, how ever if you read it and don't read the sequal ""Dragon and Phoniex"" in fairly close sucsession you might feel it left a loose end or two too many. I loved the book, it managed to avoid all of the things that annoy me most, even if it is a little longer than most of what i prefer to read."
1,Wish I Would Have Known,I wish I would have known this shed is NOT watertight. What a waste of time putting this shed together and the lost of my $200.00 plus.
5,Rubbermaid 3748 Storage Shed,"This item was purchased to replace one that we have had for many years. In March, we had a severe Nor'easter that caused a lot of damage from wind and falling trees. Unfortunately, our shed was in the path of a tree. It really held up pretty well for the beating it took, but sadly it did have a crack in a hinge and could not be saved. I recommend this product for durability, esthetics and value!"
5,Potting shed,Quick delivery. Easy assembly and quite sturdy. Needed a rainproof unit for use as a potting shed. Wish stock shelving was an option though since there appears to be a recessed design for one. Regardless I put a shelf in and am very satisfied with the unit. I also have one to keep pool supplies in. Very handy and versatile.
5,Outstanding storage shed,"The custom made alcove for our trash cans had been attacked by termites and was falling apart. After much research, I decided to purchase this shed made by Rubbermaid. It arrived more quickly than expected by truck, and the driver was kind enough to help us place the flat box close to the final location of the assembled shed. The shed holds THREE (not two) trash cans (somewhat oval in shape) with sufficient additional room under the ""roof"" of the shed for extra trash if/when the occasion arises. It took my husband and myself about 30 mintes (maximum, I wasn't timing it) to assemble the shed. We needed virtually no tools. The directions aren't THAT clear, but it's not hard to figure out. The shed is perfect and we have not had any animals thus far try to chew their way inside. The trash collectors apparenty find it easy enough to close, since the doors are never left open or the roof askew. Highly recommended."
4,Storage Shed,"The product is exactly what I wanted. It was received with a part missing which was promply replaced by Rubbermaid. This item was shipped by Eagle Trucking. Their tracking was between ""poor"" and ""useless"" as the dates kept changing and was not delivered in the provided time frame. Had I not called Eagle, I do not believe it would have ever been delivered. When it was delivered the Eagle delivery personnel were extremely curtious and placed it per my request."
4,Instructions,You must read the instructions carefully before trying to put it together I had base upside down and was ready to trash the wholwe thing until I went back and read them carefully. You need to level the area. Once it's together and on a level area it works well.
3,Good Product for the Money,"I bought this product because I had a problem with animals getting into my garbage cans and needed a way to keep them out. The directions aren't the greatest and after attempting to put it together myself I waited for a 2nd person and it went smoothly. I was a little concerned about there not being any hardware to actually put it together and keep it together, it's hard plastic that has pieces that slide and lock (somewhat) together so we'll see how it holds up. So far so good, but I've been gentle with it. It serves it's purpose well for the money."
4,overpriced,This is the second of these I have purchased. They are perfect for trash can storage and for recyclables.This may be purchased from Home Depot for $229.99
4,storage shed,"I purchased the shed for storing my generator, it fits ok.I just didnt know how big 32 cb in was.I would have bought the next size up.I'm satified."
3,"Horizontal Storage Shed, 32 Cu Ft","Quality of this product has deteriorated. I bought Horizontal Storage Shed, 18 Cu Ft about 9 years ago and the quality is much better. No problems with shipment."
2,Not for kids.,"Bought these two years ago. They looked great out of the box, and tended to hold their color nicely. However, they chip fairly easily and we had our kids ruin a good number of them just putting dishes in the sink. As a result, they are no longer our primary dishes."
2,Long time owner,"First of all, this set gets absolutely nuclear in the microwave while failing to allow the food to heat. I've had these about five years, and have been burned multiple times. Secondly the odd sizes won't fit in most standard kitchen cabinets. The dinner plates hold a king size meal though. The bowels don't stack well at all, and again, a bowl of chili requires an oven mitt to eat. The mugs are wide and shallow taking up much more space than necessary. And over time the chips have been large and numerous. Some glazing defects showed cavities after the first few washes"
4,ehhh,I really enjoy the pattern and the service is great!! The plates are a big big so make sure you have deep cabinets... Only disappointments are they chip easily and boy do they get hot!!! So be careful microwaving!
1,Disappointing,"My 5 year old daughter, who has seen me return home from the pottery studio with my works in hand, was really excited to received her own pottery wheel for her birthday. We were both greatly disappointed to find that the wheel power was so insufficient that each time she even gently placed her hands on the clay, the wheel came to a grinding halt. Given this, it was impossible to even teach her the basics of centering clay, let alone create any sort of thrown piece. I did not expect this to work as well as the wheels I use, but I did expect that she could at least learn a few fundamental skills. This product was completely disappointing and I would not recommend it, particularly if there is no parent with throwing experience. If this is the best product out there, I recommend sticking to hand building with clay--they can learn to thrown on a wheel when they are old enough to go to a proper studio."
1,My Review 2003,"I think this toy is not educational at all. It is way to over priced and it breaks really fast. It is a usless toy thjat is expensive to buy but cheap when it comes to playing with it. I had bought one for my little sister for christmas and two day after she was playing with it, it broke so I thought ok maybe she did it so I took it and told them whant had happened and then I got anonther one for her then the next day it broke so it is really a cheap toy in my eyes. And you might say ooh.... your sister was too young to be playing with it well my sister is 14 years old. So that is my review for the Pottery Wheel."
1,The Pottery wheel,I tried using the pottery wheel the other day and it made a big mess it went all over the celling and carpet and we can't get it off.So i think that it is not suitable for other children my age (age5).
2,Not a good wheel,This thing only works for very small pottery stuff and the clay that came with it sucked it didnt work and had black spots all over it
1,Not the exact same part...,"I ordered this using the information on my existing unit. However, the existing unit has a hose coming off of it in a place where the new unit is blocked up. This should have been a no-brainer replacement and now I have to hire an HVAC guy to tell me why the parts are slightly different, even though they have the same part numbers."
3,cribbage pegs - shipping was exorbitant!,"The cribbage pegs arrived fine and where what we ordered. However, I guess we didn't pay enough attention to the actual shipping cost, as we paid $8.95 for S&H; and the pegs arrived in a plain, white envelope with .84 for postage.Caveat Emptor!P"
1,BIGGEST PIECE OF GARBAGE,"This slow, loud, very tempermental portable dvd player is not worth the aggrevation of purchasing it. The box it came in was more usefull to me than the DVD player. It is slow and was dropped once from a bed to the floor and then refused to work which was ok with me cause when it did actually work it was sluggish and had a mind of its own, if it liked a particular sceen in a movie it would play it over and over again or just freeze up or the sound would not be in sync with the movie, like watching the old chinese karate movies. I finaly ate my losses and threw it across the room. My advice take the [money] and buy something nice for your special someone, not on this piece of crap."
5,Clears the End-Time Clutter,FR. WILLIAM KURZ really took the mystery out of the end-times with this book. You have all these Protestants running around screaming rapture rapture the sky is falling (reference to Chicken Little) and they don't even know what they are talking about. The rapture was invented by a 7 day Adventives preacher in the 1840's and the Protestants have globed onto it. I don't know why but they have. Well Father clears up a lot of this kind of disinformation. Read the book and get the end-times facts straight.
4,Excited to find it.,"The book was out of print and the price on some of them was over $100. Some how I managed to order two and one was in near perfect condition and the other had a few highlighted words. I haven't had a chance to read it, but I expect it to be very good and helpful."
1,Horrible,"At first glance, Van Helsing for the GBA looks like a solid platformer using an isometric view instead of the tried 2-D side scroller fare that is so apparant in licensed GBA games. A lot could have been done so right with Van Helsing, but this game is absolutely horrible. Featuring clunky controls, fuzzy graphics, almost non-existant difficulty, and a horde of glitches and bugs, this is one of the worst games to hit the GBA in recent memory. All in all, if you are a fan of the film and had interest in checking this game out, don't fall for it, leave this on the shelf where it belongs."
1,Atrocious but Predictable - Given the Audience,"(sigh). What can you really say about yet another preaching-to-the-choir anti-semitic screed. That it seems to have been written by an early crackhead? That The Count (if he actually existed and wrote this drivel) had too much time on his hands? It's a quandry. Wholly lacking in even the most rudimentary scholarship, disorganized, raving, hate-filled - wait, it's the perfect nightcap after you've read selections from George Lincoln Rockwell! There may actually be some valid area in which the influence of various ethnic groups, sub-groups and tribal organizations may be studied and their influence on governments defined. None of that is extant here. This is just the (hopefully)inebriant-fueled ravings of an anti-semite who probably missed the stirrup one time too many. I would have given NO STARS but Amazon kindly omits that choice. Drivel."
3,This is a Reissue,For long term fans of JAK - please be aware that this is a reissue of one of her oldest books #91 of the Temptation serials.
2,Disappointed and surprised this is one of her older books!,"I read anything that is published by Ms. Krentz (as Krentz, Quick or Castle). And her MIRA books are short and often quite good (I liked ""Between the Lines"". ""True Colors"" wasn't that bad, but I become tired of Jamie's indecision about who to trust about halfway through the book. I almost put it down because I couldn't take her whining again and the whispers to herself as to what to do. But... finally she trusts (at a critical moment, thank goodness) and all is right. It was a diverting read for an afternoon, but definitely not a keeper."
2,Not The Best,This is not one of Jayne Ann Krantz better books. The plot was too convulted and inner conflict that character was feeling was too long and drawn out. It took away from the storyline.
1,Poor Value,Short book of under 10 pages with a disjointed story. Only a few pages that read in three minutes. Worth about twenty five cents.
3,Butterfly Charm,"It is quite pretty, but the stones come out in short order with normal use. I bought this and the starter bracelet together. Once I figured out how to put it on there, which takes some figuring, it looked cute enough. Unfortunately, not as big as it looks either. I wouldn't buy it again"
4,Patience rewards,"I agree with most of the comments in the reviews to date (five, prior to mine). Some patience is required for reading this book. At times it's somewhat ""foreign"" (and unless you're Hawaiian and/or know Hawaii well, you're probably entitled to feel strange), but its language is uniquely rich and its construction and thought are stunningly insightful, very rewarding. Don't be surprised if you're rather inarticulate after reading this book. It's complicated, worth re-reading, and certainly a recommendation for adventurous readers."
2,Unbelieveably dense,"I can't imagine this book being of interest to anyone other than serious Hawaiian history buffs or students of poetry. I'm not one who insists that his poetry rhyme, but some sort of meter, rhythm, or structure would have been helpful. In fact, the only thing that this has in common with what most people would recognize as poetry is its format on the printed page. It looks like verse, but it reads more like stream-of-consciousness prose, with thoughts, dialog, and descriptions continually running into one another.This is a good story that definitely hasn't been given its due before, but reading this version will send you screaming for the Hemmingway library."
1,Think twice before ordering,"My experience with this watch has been dissapointing. It now a piece of junk after 4 months of use!!Firstly on receipt, I suspected that may not be swiss made watch, the local technician concurred and according to him the mechanical movement resembles those fake taghuer machine from china.The side push button which operates one of the three faces ie the date failed it got struck and one of the faces was inoperative after 3 weeks.Couple of days ago, the watch stopped working while I was still wearing it and couldnt revive. I regret my decision."
2,not bad for the price,"for the price its not bad, but as a watch you get what you pay for. The band felt fake, and the watch itself is too think for my taste. I ended up returning the watch"
2,nice look but.....,"my wife wanted us to get exact watches for valentine's day and she saw this watches that look nice and trendy and had a good price.So we decided to get 2 MENS LUCIEN PICCARD AUTOMATIC 3 EYE DATE WATCH 26570BU,in a matter of a week we got the watches but one of them came with the days hand off and some screws of the mechaninal part in the back were loose and you could see them thou the clear back the watch came with,lucky for us the other was intact.I understand that although the watch looks nice it's much too fragile even for the price since i owned a lot of cheap watches( casio,swatch,pulsar,etc..)and they are not this fragile."
1,Bad watch and service from seller,Bought the same watch but black dial from the same seller and the day dial stop working after 2 weeks. Sent back to seller for repair and seller claimed never received but promised to send a new one. Yet to receive the watch after more than 2 months. Contacted seller but seller is not responding. Bad service and low quality watch. Can get better deal for the same price.
4,homegrown world groove,"Baaba Seth's """"homegrown world groove"""" is a melting pot of world music: African, Reggae, and Latin styles give new purpose to the funk and jazz of America. A full horn section and lavish percussion, poetic lyrics and a positive message create an energy like no other. The result is a magnetic vibe that moves the body as much as it uplifts the soul. http://www.methodshop.com"
1,There is nothing to review cause this disc doesn't exist,"well there is nothing to review about this disc because i've searched everywhere for it. . . . even the LOTL website, and this disc does not exist. I contacted a manager of a record store who also runs the LOTL website and he does not now of any new disc. But maybe i could be wrong . . . so if someone could prove me wrong i would love to hear a new lowest of the low disc. out."
5,Terror: lowest of the low,this cd has two great feature 1 is the music from this cd and live profomance from them also you love to hear both
5,A Living Book,"This is a great children's lap book to teach about great people and American founding principles. Six chapter biographies about William Penn, Thomas Paine, Elijah Parish Lovejoy, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Edwin Markham, Marian Anderson, Albert Einstein."
2,Don't be fooled!!!,"Don't be fooled. As you go through the steps of ordering this product it is made to look as if you get a case (12) bottles, when in reality you only get (1) bottle for an outrageous price. Deceptive???"
5,Amazing cookbook,"I have owned this cookbook for over two years now and I still pull it out just to read the recipes and look at the beautiful photographs. I have made dozens of the recipes and have found them all to be wonderful - well written, simple to prepare, and always delicious. If I had to limit myself to only one cookbook (and I have many,) this would be the one I'd choose."
5,Patricia Wells At Home In Provence,"This is a WONDERFUL cookbook containing some of the best recipes I have ever prepared. But more than that, it's an invitation to enjoy the landscape and history of Provence. Excellent work, Patricia!Warm regards, Linda Quest :)"
2,Why so many 5 star reviews?,"They tricked me. I watched the whole movie, but from the start of it, I realized I was fooled. I laughed one time at the end when they were in the warehouse... that was it.If you like ridiculous movies, go for it. If you are not so sure about this one, keep it moving.I seriously think the majority of the ppl who posted the 5 star ratings are out to convince you to sit and watch this as they did, but with negative intentions."
1,MYSTERY SOLVED!,"Before we begin, let me just say that if you are 12 or under you are in for one hell of a knee-slapping laugh riot! Take a swig of that Mountain Dew and prepare to spew it through your nostrils because there be laughs over yonder!However, if you are 13 or above you may see this movie for the corny amateur schlock fest that it is. You may not laugh because of how hard the scrappy cast is trying to make you laugh. You may not be entertained by the tired parody of Scooby Doo gone adult because that concept has become so obvious it is not entertaining anymore. You may not even want to rent this movie.Nonetheless, I'm glad to see the cast and crew of Mystery Team do their part with a flood of overwhelmingly positive five star ratings. I would have been even more glad to see them write, produce, and direct an original and, dare I say, funny comedy."
1,Disappointing - fairly boring - barely funny,Don't believe the hype. I considering stopping the movie 3 times and should have. I ended up doing some work while letting it play. Very LAME movie. The humor was NOT very good over all. I think I laughed out loud a total of 2 times. Don't waste your time.
1,TERRIBLE BOY/GUY HUMOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"5 stars really? I must have watched a different film than the others. This was undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever rented. It was a complete waste of time and money. It was painfully awful and the longer I watched the more disappointing it got. I think I may have chuckled once, but not loud enough for anyone to notice. The best way to describe this film is GUY HUMOR!! No offense boys, but I bet the people giving this film 5 stars were guys between the ages of 16-30. If you like the mix of boyish silly and crude comedy, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, stay away!!!"
3,Fun but seems to try playing to two different audiences,"I enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if a choice had been made whether to make a clever movie or a vulgar movie. It kept flip flopping and thus doesn't really play well to either audience. A lot of good stuff, though - good performances, some really clever bits. The sound when I saw it could have still used a little bit of clean-up as well; kind of bright and a bit inconsistent. Not bad, mind you, just not 100% professional. Perhaps it's been cleaned up for DVD/Blu-Ray."
1,4 years of svc...... several months of headaches,"I originally placed my order with my a digital camera and this four year service plan. Three days after, I had to cancel my digital camera order for personal reasons. However the $161.80 total I spent on this warrant did not refund automatically and nor have I received a confirmation that it will be refunded. After several phone calls and emails of providing information for the requested refund. They finally tell me that it will take 8 weeks for my refund to process. That is two whole months. Horrible service I can't imagine how long it would take for them to either repair or replace my camera should it have faltered. I would not recommend this four year service plan or any other plan by N.E.W. Customer Service Companies to anyone."
3,Not received,I received a copy of my extended warranty on this camera by e-mail. The e-mail also stated that I would get a copy by mail. I have never received a copy of the warranty through the U.S. Post Office. Other than that I have no complaints.
2,Faulty Product,"Both Volumes of Season 4 products are faulty. The trademark Paladin Introductions ""gun pointed"" sound is missing! I even had one series part 2 replaced and the second was also not right.This was quite disappointing!"
5,Good old classic,Anyone who is a fan of the classic tv western will enjoy this set. Good stories with lots of folks who became stars in their own rights.
5,Great companion supply for the easel,Nice to know there is extra paper handy for the next masterpiece. Just right for the easel.
3,2 large pads of easel paper,"The paper is fine, I just feel that the price is not comparable to what I could find elsewhere."
2,Average Mystery,"Alice, the amateur sleuth, spends most of her time in the book struggling to prove to everyone that her friend Barbara did not commit suicide, but was instead murdered. The plot was clever, but I found myself not very interested in most of the other characters. Barbara's husband Tim was a pretty intriguing guy, but some of the secrets that came out about him didn't get very far in the story. I'm also a little puzzled as to why most of the characters, whom all had very different personalities and backgrounds, all had the same reaction to Alice's declaration that Barbara was murdered. Hmmm. I'll probably try to read a few other books in the series to see if perhaps I just happened to pick up one of Adamson's weaker ones."
3,Catnip in the Garden,"I found this book at one of my favorite thrift stores and picked it up because of the herb theme in it. Even though it was an easy read, it didn't really seem to be fleshed out enough for me. The secrets that came out weren't developed and left me wondering what was behind it all. The reactions of the characters all seemed to be the same but why? Okay, so part of the story was about dealing with grief of the death of a good friend, but it just didn't seem to flow. The herb (catnip) wasn't talked about much except for a short conversation Alice had with a store owner. There was no discussion of why this was the herb that was picked as their main crop in the garden. What made this herb 'the one'? As another reviewer said this might just be one of those 'off' books. I'll look for more of her books to see if her other books have a different feel."
5,fast delivery,"I was in a hurry for this book, as it was the next-in-line for a series I'm reading and it was not available at my local library. I was glad that it arrived quickly and in good condition. It was also well-packaged."
5,Crazier than a bag of dust!,"Yo, this joint is so crazy its ridiculous! Sure club banger if I ever heard one. Glad that westcheddar is finally getting repped right! Ruff Ryders, bacdafucup, ya heard? These kids is illmatic. Best MC's? Tie between #1,#2 and #3 with a nod to #6."
3,It's OKAY,"Yeah, ""Deja Vu"" is just okay. It's not fantastic, it's not bad, it's just okay but forgetable. Beyonce's voice sounds really strained towards the middle of the song.I keep hearing that ""Deja Vu"" has a Michael Jackson ""Off The Wall"" vibe to it, but I guess I missed it becauses I don't hear any resemblence. It actualy sounds more like the remix to ""Crazy In Love."" Jay-Z doesn't add anything to the song either. Other than that I recommend listening to ""Deja Vu"" by Dionne Warwick, Teena Marie, or Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz."
2,What the He--??!!!!!,What a let down! I only like the cut Deja Vu and MAYBE Irreplaceable. That is it! And then I was disappointed with Deja Vu because the music was not like in her live performances. Not as energetic. And the other songs -- I cannot even understand what she is saying. WHATEVER. It actually sounds like she did it in two days instead of two weeks. Just thrown together!
1,Well here's another one,"Well, Beyonce did it again...another cd but only this time it didn't compliment her at all. She said that she put this cd together in 2 weeks-well it sure sounds like it!! It's not your typical Beyonce cd. Now, don't get me wrong I'm all for Beyonce I've liked her since way back Destiny's Child but this cd just doesn't do her any justice. Even though I think this cd is not good it will probably go platinum just because it's BEYONCE and everybody wants to see what she's come up with since she hasn't been out in a while. All in all, I would not waist my money on this. Right now, I'm rating this as a ""must play over and over and over again to like it"" in other words it's really going to have to grow on me. Did I mention over and over again??"
2,just ok,"I think Beyonce has talent&is one of those Musical Acts with that Certain ""IT"",but at the same time her musical tendency's tend to be over the top. vocally she goes overboard&over things tend to bring down her attempts at what she is trying to get to. this song is just part 2 of ""Crazy in Love"" which was a better track. this song sounds like it jacks Teena Marie's 'Square Biz"". bringing back Jay Z is a waste of time because his rap on here makes no sense whatsoever. her vocal runs are nice& the channeling of Tina Turner is cool in places,but more records like this show while Beyonce has a pressence along with charisma&is a Foxxy mama,but making another so-so track is not a good look at a career that could&Should be something special in time."
1,not worth the money,I recieved this for my daughter for a Christmas present. It is very small and cheap. I know it will not last very long. I would opt for the larger more pricey set from another store.
4,"great product, but spoon already broke","we love most of this set because it goes well with the kitchen we got and it is the perfect size pieces. However, the spoon broke within a week just from regular play. We've replaced it with another wooden spoon as we love the rest of the set."
5,Kid sized!,Fantastic real life type cook set for toddlers. My 2 year old is a master chef with this set. Great quality set! Love the oven mitt and potholder!
1,Do NOT Buy the Canadian Edition!,"Score zero for CBS-Viacom. The box arrived today after being released yesterday here in Canada. There on the back cover ""24 exciting season 2 episodes"". Only one problem, there are 25 episodes in season two. The missing episodes? Episode #41 Season 2-#16, 7 January 1970 ""Bored, She Hung Herself"". This episode was pulled from distribution after the series first aired. Viacom has refused to re-release it. I though for sure it would be on the official release. Nope! So now us 5-0 fans still have incomplete sets. A big zero for CBS-Viacom and a big zero for fans. We are adults in Canada you know?"
1,"""Bored, I Still Will Not Buy It!!!""","You have got to be kidding!!! To include edited versions of unidentified episodes of ""Hawaii Five-O"" and exclude the individual episode, ""Bored, She Hung Herself"", on this second season set is completely egregious. Shame on the cheap, uncaring, and myopic people at Paramount and Amazon. What kind of encore will be performed for distribution of season 3? Commercials inserted into the episodes? How about no ending credits for each episode? I am not impressed at all."
1,Careful,"The second season may not be complete as 1 episode may not be included ( Bored, She Hung Herself ) and other episodes may be edited from their originally aired versions"
1,Hawaii Five 0 The Second Season DVDs,"Please see my review of Season One first:For Season Two, they added episode previews as the 'Special Feature'. NOT all of the previews are here. In fact, they left out an entire episode."
5,Hawaii 5-0 DVDs,Got this for my fiancé to take with him to work where the Internet often doesn't work. Great item. FAst shipment.
5,Excellent!,Growing up watching this series was really something to look forward to. Being able to watch it all over again on dvd is even more enjoyable. Great series.
5,Great Show That Brings Back Good Memories,"There are so many good things about this show.....beautiful scenery, a link to the past, a view of the way Hawaii looked before becoming overdeveloped, and also good acting. It was ""real"" for the time without being too extreme (like all the cop shows now)and one can still get a sense of ""culture"" of the time. What CAN one say about McGarrett??? He is totally awesome!!!"
5,The episode 6 in season number 2 is great,I like the way Marianne McAndrew (played Joyce Bennett) acted when she put some violent action using a gun that wasplaced in her purse. She was probably hypnotized by a doctor in school.
3,blind tiger,There are scenes missing from this Video. Which makes this video less enjoyable. I would like to know if this is true on the actual dvd before i buy this dvd.
5,yahoo!! keep em coming!,"one of the all time great tv shows. please, please keep the releases coming!!"
3,"hmmm, disappointed? Yes!","Got my 2nd season today and with the controversial episode(for those times) missing and other episodes edited, come on Paramount, not good. Don't get me wrong. I love the show but I wish they would speed up the release times and stop messing with the original versions. Like previous post, 5 stars but only gets 3 because it's an incomplete set. I'm still excited to add it to the collection though.The Salt Lake City area has a local station, KPNZ I think, that had been playing 2 episodes/night(8pm,9pm Mon-Fri ish) for awhile now (past year or so), but up until lately they had discontinued it and replaced it with stupid info-commercials and other lame shows. The lineup use to be Hawaii Five-0 at 7pm, then an hour of Magnum PI and then another hour of Hawaii Five-0. That was some sweet programming. At least I could get my Hawaii Five-0 fix before they started coming out on DVD."
4,A little Jack Lord goes a long ways.,"When I purchased season 1, I had not seen the show in at least 25 years, so it was kind of refreshing.Now with season 2 I see why my parents did not watch it much.I know Jack Lord was the star of the show but enough is enough and it seems he is at every murder in Hawaii day or night, no matter how big or small. The head of the state police should have his underlings do the dirty work.The one thing that really gets me though is when McGarret goes undercover when everyone and his dog knows what he looks like.Disc 5 on the set has some of the best episodes so far:1.Killer Bee2.Cry, Lie3.The One With the Gun4.Most Likely to MurderThis season really finished with some great episodes and now am fired up to get Season 3 when the price comes down !"
3,"Where is ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" Episode","Hawaii Five-O had a great run on TV and Jack Lord and Charles MacArthur, (Helen Hayes son) made a great team as McGarrett and Danno, however WHY, let me repeat WHY is the second season not complete. A small print disclamer on the rear bottom back of the box says the ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" episode is not included and only aired once. Yes it does not say complete second season episodes on the box. Its a 5star box set, but only 3stars for the missing episode"
5,SUPERB SERIES!!,"I thought that the first season was amazing, but was pleased to see that the second season was equally fanatastic.The writing was incomparable, the acting superb. Jack Lord's performance as Steve McGarrett was absolutely flawless.I cannot rave enough about the second season!!"
5,Unexpected Guest Stars,"Part of the enjoyment of watching season 2 is catching a recognizable guest star/personality in the various episodes. One of the more surprising appearances is by Al Michaels (former Monday Night Football play-by-play announcer, now with NBC football), who a few years later would spring to the public consciousness by calling the ""Miracle on Ice"" when the U.S. Hockey team defeated the heavily favored Soviets. You can catch Al Michaels playing a jailhouse lawyer in the episode ""Run, Johnny, Run"", which also guest starred Christopher Walken."
5,TV FAN OF HAWAII FIVE 0,Our local TV station started showing old Hawaii Five 0 reruns and got me hooked. Then they took it off the air. I had to have them! I found them at Amazon.Com and I'm very pleased now. Hope the rest of the series is copied for us addicts.
5,Top Cop show,"So much of acting was local, and other limits by location could add up to a less than viewable series, BUT, Hawaii Five-O is one of the greats of television. The main characters, the great stories, the BEST scenery - which reminds me of my 2 1/2 yrs in Hawaii, the chemistry of the Five-0 team all make this so enjoyable. The 2nd season is much better than the first, when they were just gettin' their feet wet. Every episode is great. Already in the 2nd season, actors are being repeated as bad guys and others, but it doesn't matter - it's kind of funny. And Wo Fat shows up twice in the 2nd season. He is the best of the bad guys. Young Christopher Walken & an already seasoned-actor, Martin Sheen show up giving great performances - especially Walken."
4,Hawaii five-o - second season,"As a fan of 5-0, I have been waiting for the dvds of this show and I was not disappointed. It brings back the memories of watching the show when I was younger. If you like police drama with action then I would recommend this DVD. Before there was Walker, Dirty Harry, etc., there was McGarrett. It is violent by today's standards so I would not recommend watching it with small children but 12 and up shouldn't be a problem. It is just good drama."
3,"Inspecific, but usual Chilton quality","This manual does cover all Nova/Chevy II models from 1962-79, along with a few others. It is not very specific, though.All of the old Chevy's covered are very similar, and most of the book reads in sections based on engine CID and year, rather than specific model years...Anyway, it is a good manual that will cover EVERYTHING you need to do to your car, even a complete engine overhaul. It does not offer very much education, though, so it should probably be used by more experienced mechanics.I would recommend the second edition for the more novice/amature reader."
1,Chevrolet Nova and Chevy I I,"The information in this book is standard in all chilton manuals with few exceptions. It was a waste of money. The fact that it has Chevy II in the title is very misleading . Very little information, pictures or procedures are covered."
3,"Great rod, terrible reel.","I bought this combo three years ago. From day one the reel would easily tangle and the line would loop and tangle around the spool. At times, it would wind around the base of the spool and not in the spool itself. I tried three different lines and they all do the same regardless of which direction it was spooled.The rod on the other hand is a great rod. Strong and durable with as much sensitivity as can be expected from a medium rod. I use this set up for bass and pan fish.If I had to do it again, I would just buy the rod and leave the spool in the store."
2,hayrate,I like shakespeare fishing equipment but the item i am looking at is too small and i cant tell much about it.
5,Must have for any Star Wars fan,As a long time Star Wars fan this movie is a must own! The premise is one that everyone dreamed of as Episode 1 crept closer. I really love all of the cameos and one-liners that they worked into the script.
4,Great movie for anyone interested in sci-fi (especially Star Wars) and buddy road trip movies,"This had a lot of little jokes for fans of Star Wars (and even makes fun of Star Trek but in a fun way) and also has a nice serious side to it. I quite enjoyed it and so did my friends who watched it with me (on different occasions). We were all laughing at many points throughout.I see a lot of critics bashing this movie, but I think it was good fun and a nice buddy/road trip movie. What did they expect, an Oscar contender?The extras on the disc were a nice addition, which unfortunately aren't there on the Canadian version."
3,Not That Good,"I wasn't sure what to expect watching this movie knowing that I like both Star Wars and Star Trek and had read some of the reviews. The movie is entertaining at times, but the problem with these kinds of spoof type movies is they tend to get overly stupid. The cameo's in the movie are among the biggest highlights, but there are plenty of other places in the movie where you just groan and wonder what they were thinking when they made it. Its an ok movie, but not really the big deal some have made it out to be even if your a Star Wars fan."
5,Fanboys...is FAN-tastic!,I'm a Star Wars junky and this fit the bill! Loved it and so did the next generation of junkies...my sons loved it too.
2,Terrible movie,"The only good thing about this movie is seeing Veronica Mars in a slave Leia costume, and that only happens briefly at the very end. She's awesome and the reason for the second star in my rating, but she's not enough to save this awful movie.I'm a huge Star Wars nerd and I can honestly say there were almost no funny moments in this movie. The whole thing feels like a movie not made by fans of Star Wars, but by people who perhaps met a Star Wars fan in passing somewhere.The cameo appearances are nice, but just about every main actor in this movie is one of those annoying extras from other low budget 2 star movies.Dan Fogler ruins every scene he is in. Will somebody please stop casting him?"
2,Ending of the movie made me laugh the hardest???,"the ending of the movie was great,the words"" what if the movie sucks""had me laughing the rest not so much,rent only"
1,"Promised years ago, and they just gave up","I remember back when they first started talking about doing this movie, Star Wars was still popular at that time and it seemed like a good theme. After many years of it being pushed around and forgotten about it was released to theaters in limited viewing, a few months later its out on DVD. Not too surprising. The film itself is rather boring. The only reason I would suggest watching the movie is for the brief scene with Kevin Smith and Jason Mews. There is an easy walk around that you can go to the deleted scenes and watch and extended cut of the scene."
1,HAN SOLO'S NOT THE B$%HCH...IT'S JUST THIS FILM,"CAN ANYBODY BELIEVE THAT THE DIRCTOR GOT PAID FOR DOING THIS CRAPFEST??, NOT ME.THERE'S NOT ONE PART OF THIS MOVIE THATS EVEN FUNNY,NOT THAT I WHEN TO SEE IT IN THEATERS,MY COUSIN BUGGED ME TO SEE IT A FEW WEEKS AGO ON DVD. IT'S SAD THAT THEY CAN WASTE TIME AND MONEY MAKING THIS ""STUFF"",HOW THIS MOVIE WAS EVEN A THEATER DRAW IS BEYOND ME.THERE'S ONE LAST THING I'M GONNA SAY...THIS MOVIE IS A SLAP TO THE FACE FOR THE OLD MOVIES.I MEANT JUST LOOK HOW RETARDED THE DVD COVER LOOKS...BUT HEY WHO AM I TO JUDGE?,BUT IF YOU LIKE STUFF THAT HAS NOINTELLIGENT REALITY WHAT SO EVER THIS PIECE OF CRAP IS FOR YOU.PLEASE NOTE:THAT MOST OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE FROM PEAPLE WHO LIKE WATCHING STUPID SHOWS LIKE FAMILY GUY."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Fanboys is an extremely overrated comedy, about four friends, who decide to break in to George Lucas's home, in order to steal a copy of Star Wars: Episode 1, six months before it hits theaters. The movie was very well reviewed and had a big word of mouth following, and being a huge Sci-Fi fan, I couldn't wait to see it. The story however was extremely weak and filled with cliche Star Wars jokes. It was predictable, done, and really just lame. The only really cool thing about the film was the cameos. In this tiny independent film they had cameos by William Shatner, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Kevin Smith, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and Seth Rogan, an impressive list to be sure! Like I said thou, the movie was weak and done. Unless you're a diehard Star Wars fan, I'd skip this one."
3,Two and a half stars for mixed bag movie,"This movie is okay and makes me wish Amazon would allow for half stars as I would go with two and a half. The Lucas fanboy references are really fun from the sound effects to the android policemen from THX and the cameos were great, particularly from Seth Rogen, Shatner and Danny McBride. The problem is that the leads aren't very interesting other than the ones played by Baruchel and Fogler who really give it their all. A cancer plotline is mentioned, but comes in and out and anyone who has been around cancer will find the movie more than a little insulting with the brevity with which its handled. It can feel like a series of vignettes with little holding it together, but every time it gets boring there's some new silliness. Three stars."
3,Not bad,"Funny film, but i can't believe the characters went to all that hassle for The Phantom Menace. lol"
4,Fanboys-Funny movie.,"Although I hate Star Wars(Yes I am sorry I do, I hate star Trek Even More) I found the movie very funny and Yes I did get the star wars references, I didn't think it would be funny, but it was, And I enjoyed the movie, Even if your not a Starwars fan you should watch, But Trekkies or Trekkers Beware!LOL. the only part That made me angry was seeing Kevin Spacey's Name as Producer. He is a Communist tool."
4,A fun film for Star Wars fans,"It seems like Fanboys took years to come out...Sometimes when a film is delayed like that it usually means the movie is...Well...Bad.This isn't the case with Fanboys, it's a very fun movie about Star Wars and friendship.The film is set in the late 90's. A group of friends decide to steal a copy of Episode 1 so their terminal friend can see it before he dies.The film has a good message, which is seldom seen in a lot of the recent sex-based comedies. It's about friendship and sticking together.If you're not much of a Star Wars fan this is an alright comedy. If you are a ""fanboy,"" than this is a really nice treat.Thumbs up."
5,The force is strong in this one!,"What can I say, this was a great movie for true Star Wars fans. I have loved Star Wars since 1977 and I totally related to the characters in the movie. I would have been about their age when the movie took place and so would have thought about doing what they did. The cameos were great. If your not a fan of the Star Wars movies, don't watch it, simple as that. If you love Str Wars then this movie is for you. I remember how excited I was when I found out about the Phantom Menace and I remeber counting down to when it would be released. If you remember that as well watch this movie."
3,very funny and entertaining,"disco es entretenido, pero al principio incluye una gran cantidad de remolques que sinceramente don `t like me. los que me aburren. Sin embargo, el panorama es tan divertido"
3,Good for a Laugh,It's a fun movie to watch with other Star Wars fans. I was talked into it and went in with low expectations. It was worth the rental.
3,Rental,"This movie is good, but only to watch once. I don't think it was worth a purchase from me. I think it would have been better as a rental. Not really a watch it more than once kind of movie. It didn't have the jokes or characters I would like to hear/see more than once."
2,Pretty dumb,"I'm a huge ""Star Wars"" fan, but even I had trouble sitting through this one...which through the majority was not clever or wry, but simply stupid and sophomoric. Not well-written, not well-acted...not even particularly entertaining."
2,"Good idea, but badly executed.","When I heard about the plot of the movie, I thought it was hilarious. A bunch of Star Wars fans breaking into Skywalker Ranch? Unfortunately, the execution wasn't as funny. The Star Wars jokes are a little corny, which sucks because I was hoping it would be awesome.Also, I suspect that the film was partly inspired by the movie ""Detroit Rock City"" in which four friends go to great lengths to get into a sold-out Kiss concert. Both movies also have Sam Huntington and a stripping scene."
4,PRETTY GOOD,"THIS MOVIE WAS OKAY...KIND OF CORNY AT TIMES, BUT DAN FOGLER IS OBVIOUSLY THE FUNNY CARD IN THIS MOVIE, WITH OUT HIM MY REVIEW WOULD HAVE PROBBALY BEEN 2 STAR, THE REST OF THE CAST WASN'T ALL THAT GREAT, A FEW LAUGHS FROM HERE AND THERE, BUT THATS IT. IF YOU ARE A STAR WARS FAN ...THAN YOU MIGHT BE MORE INTO IT THAN I WAS"
2,"Controversy aside, a poor film","The Bottom Line:As one of the three or four people who saw Fanboys in theaters I can assure you that it's a waste of money--with an almost complete dearth of laughs, fun, or anything that makes a movie enjoyable to watch, this film feels like direct to video fodder and should be avoided by everyone, fanboys and casual movie-watchers alike.2/4"
4,Get the state right!,Can they fix this review? Kirk is from Iowa not Ohio.That scence is perhaps the best one of the movie.
3,It's all right,"It will occasionally pluck your fanboy heartstrings, but it's nothing to write home about.It's worth a rental at least."
3,Quick delivery,This item was very quickly delivered to me and since it was a gift I was excited about that. The quality of the disc however wasn't as described. Very flimsy case and the disc was very scratched up. When watching the movie there were one scene had to be skipped all together due to skipping.
4,Funny movie,This was a pretty funny movie. Better than I expected. I am a nerd at heart so I was very into all of the little side jokes etc. My wife even liked it and she isn't usually into the nerdy movies like I am.
3,Love the Movie- Case Dammaged,"For the price I paid, I'll accept that the package was dammaged, and that it looked like it was attacked by a heat gun."
2,Okay,"An okay film. Tries too hard to be funny at times. Some gross out gags don't help much. When I first saw it, I thought the film was really funny, but that was probably due to taking an Ambien."
4,Use the Farce...,"""Fanboys""(Weinstein, 2009)------------------------------------It's geeky guest-star cameos galore in this pop-culture mega-farce about four - no, wait, five! -- Star Wars fans from Ohio who live out their fifth-grade dream of breaking into George Lucas' Marin County ranch in order to see a ""sneak peak"" of Episode One of the Star Wars films. It's a road trip flick packed with pop-culture references and nerd humor, as well as appearances by folks such as Seth Rogen, Kevin Smith & Jason Mewes, Billy Dee Willams, Carrie Fisher and --gasp!!-- William Shatner. It's pretty funny, if a bit strained at times... Mostly, it's familiar, and comforting in a way, like an old friend whose just showed up at your door and needs a place to crash for a month or two. The THX-1138 references at the end are especially welcome. Funny and fun!"
4,Very funny - great cameos,"Very funny movie with lots of great cameos. Definitely worth watching. The Amazon review was kind of harsh, especially since the reviewer missed a couple of things: The film takes place in 1998, not 1999. The Fanboys travel to Captain Kirk's hometown in Iowa - the boys themselves were from Ohio. I'm nitpicking, but if you are going to say that a film lacks ""inspiration"" and ""laughter,"" at least know what you are talking about. Give this one a try - but rent before buying because it's not for everyone. If you liked ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" or ""Road Trip"" you will probably like ""Fanboys."""
