5,A must for the new fans of Jose Jose,"Great collection of hits from the 70's and part of the 80's of Jose Jose in his best performance. Very good songs. Each one is a masterpiece. Also, new versions (with composer Rafael Perez Botija style ) of his two golden classics: ""La nave del olvido"" and ""El triste"". If you want to know who is Jose Jose this is a very good choice."
5,Wow! He is the king of the song!,I have to say it's a shame that no one here in America listens to such a romantic singer. But trust me he is the best.
3,"Great songs, no point.","Every song on this cd is excellent, but there is absolutely no point of releasing this. It's just some of the tracks from ""Boston"" and ""Don't Look Back""! Bye those two albums instead of this..."
5,As intelligent and entertaining as the show itself,"The writer faced with the momentous task of conveying the brilliance and sophistication of what many believe to be the most influential sit-com of all time turns out to be as impressive as the show itself. Vince Waldron's research is impeccable, the writing is smart and thoughtful, but best of all, this book is genuinely entertaining and reads like a good novel. It's full of fun, insider scoop and has so much affection for its subject, it'll make you want to see every episode all over again. Highly recommended for fans of The Dick Van Dyke Show, sit-coms or tv history."
4,Well written,"This is a very detailed book on the making of the Dick Van Dyke show, with alot of production details. It has a great guide to all the episodes at the end. I would have preferred more information on the actors' careers and less on the producers, directors, writers, etc. but it's all still interesting. All in all, it's a good book and covers the show's entire run.(One annoyance is learning that some of Carl Reiner's and Dick Van Dyke's favorite episodes were ones I didn't like that much, while some of the ones I liked they looked down upon. I don't know why, but knowing this spoils the episodes in question(until you can forget about it), especially the ones they didn't like but I did. Just goes to show all opinions/ preferences can be destructive. The author doesn't go overboard with this but does make it clear which episodes ""ranked"".)"
2,Dry,"This is an important book. It was originally a dissertation. Unless you need to read this book for academic reasons your time will likely be better spent in reading Baptism in the Spirit: Luke-Acts and the Dunn Debate -- an engaging and scholarly overview that corrects some of Dunn's missteps.Baptism in the Spirit: Luke-Acts and the Dunn DebateOr, another excellent option:The Charismatic Theology of St. Luke"
2,"God, ""The same yesterday, today, and forever.""","The book title basically speaks for itself and the Bible does, too. If God doesn't change, just because we live in the 2000's, doesn't mean God has changed either.If the Bible states that God doesn't change, then it is pointless to give the relation as to how it pertains to us today."
5,Great product,This is just what I need Brand New!!! My college book store wanted 30.00 for this I got it for about 6 bucks total!
4,All The Magic,"Lester Bowie will be sorely missed. In a world where smooth junk jazz rules the airwaves and young guns can't get out of the shadows of the past masters, here was a guy that put adventure into his music. Bowie was not afraid to take a popular song and bend it into a improvisors wonderland. Using tracks from Rapper Notorious B.I.G., Raggae master Bob Marley, Popsters TLC and Vanessa Williams - Lester continues the magic on ""When The Spirit Returns."" His swirling trumpet soaring above the rapid firing Brass Fantasy is spectacular. As always, the humor and improvisations are all present. This CD leaves you happy, sad and fulfilled with a lasting thought that one of the finest musical masters has past on. I am thankful that his recorded work will be around to show the future generation how much fun Jazz could truly be. Enjoy!"
5,Great replacement mirror,"Looks, works, and performs just like the OEM mirror it replaced. Installation took less then 5 minutes and only requires a 10mm socket and a screwdriver."
3,It's ok,Its a battery and seems to be working better than the one I replaced. the old one lasted for several years so I will just have to wait and see.
4,Inno replacement battery,The product was delivered on time and seems to work as well as the original.
2,Lenmar Replacement Battery,"The battery purchased was for an Inno XM portable Radio. The battery does not live up to its written recommendation. Upon leaving the battery in the product for two days (after charging, it was depleted!! I had to charge it again - the battery was depleted from just sitting for 48 hours! The ad stated that it was equal to or better than the factory battery (or words to that effect)- NADA! The factory battery held a charge for weeks even w/ constant use, and it lasted for (3) years. I will be lucky if this battery lasts one year from my initial observations.Well I now have had the battery for over (3) months - WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK! My original (3) year old battery performs as this new one does - I have to charge it every night if I wan to use it the next day! This Lenmar battery DOES NOT DO WHAT IT WAS ADVERTISED TO DO - IT IS USELESS and a WASTE OF MONEY! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
3,Not as good as original,"It doesn't last very long. Maybe 5 hours vs. 10-12 with the original. Adequate for a backup I guess, but I will use my old one for now."
1,Battery Fails,"The battery worked for a month, and then the Inno failed to recognize it. It is not a match for the Pioneer battery, which the Inno has never failed to recognize over four years."
5,All this time I thought it was my XM,I have had my Pioneer XM for 3 years. I never realized I could buy a different battery and it would make such a difference. This is well worth it.
5,Tito at his best.,This percussion heavy recording finds Tito and a group of masters including Francisco Aguabella in fine form. Skip Tito's more recent smooth outings and proceeed directly to this masterpiece.
3,Percussion Madness,"Muy buen album de la serie de la RCA sobre Tito, recomiendo tambien el trabajo CUBAN CARNIVAL de esta misma, es muy bueno aunque soy más del trabajo: PUENTE IN PERCUTION sacado años despues por el sello ALEGRE, en compañia de Willie Bobo y Santamaria nuevamente. Ritmos tradicionales de cuba acopañado por los grandes. Como te extraño Tito....."
1,BE AWARE!! This book contains MAJOR script errors,"I bought this thinking ""Macromedia should knopw how to write a dictionary about their own product, right?"" This book looks like went to press without even passing NEAR an editor's desk; in the first 5 references I looked up, four of them were incomplete or outright wrong. Syntax listings are written incorrectly, and I have found usage samples under code listings that just would not work, because they have been written incorrectly. Having worked with Flash for 6 years now, I was really hoping to have a nice handy reference to sit on my desk. This book is NOT it."
1,Ask for your money back,"I bought this book at the Macworld show, and am very disappointed to read that its full of errors, searched every forum I could find, and found that Peachpit DON'T even have an errata for this. I'm tired of trying to learn ActionScript only to discover that half the stuff written is full of sloppy mistakes. Having thumbed through it, the last 600 pages are a reproduction of the Flash Help Panel, which should have come with the software, the second 200 pages repeat the Reference book that came with Flash MX, and so we are left with 200 pages, of 6 articles by ""Community Leaders"" who few of the community seem to have heard of. There is no accompanying website for downloads or errata, and this book doesn't seem worth the investment."
3,Lots of room for improvement,"This tome is basically two books mashed together. The first being a set of Flash articles while the second is THE actual Actionscript 2.0 dictionary. While seemingly through, when you actually need to use it the index will fail you and you will need to look either at the dictionary table of contents (starting on page 411) or thumb through the second half of the book.Note: You won't find much information on any of the various components that come with Flash. This is a purely Actionscript 2.0 dictionary. Another area that is missing is any details concerning the professional features of Flash MX 2004 like slides and forms.The two good things about this book are that it is relatively inexpensive and there are numerous examples."
4,Thorough and in depth compared to other Flash Books on AS2/Flash MX 2004,"I have quite a few Flash books starting with Flash 4 and on. This book is an ideal reference and to keep handy when exploring new Actionscript commands and example applications. Yes, much of the book is a print of the Flash MX 2004 Help menu as a few reviewers have mentioned but I always wish I had a complete bound book of the help menu anyway.I am looking at ActionScript 3.0 books and I don't see anything that compares.I find many instructional books using larger type and large margins on the pages to extend the page count, where this book has quite a bit of information on each page without bloating each page in getting the book to appear larger. It is already large and packed full.This book is becoming quite outdated but if you are new to ActionScript, you will find a lot of useful information here."
3,Worth the cheap price,"While most of this book is the same material that comes with Flash in the help panel, there are also several articles in the beginning of the book. Of these articles, there were a couple that were REALLY good, changing the way I think about programming in Flash. A few of the other articles however seemed to be of less quality and not well thought out. Either way for the things I learned, it was certainly worth the cost."
4,My favorite version of the Mu Lan legend,"The illustrations are beautiful! This is an authentic presentation of the ancient folk ballad of Mu Lan. The translation adheres closely to the original Chinese text. This is simultaneously the great merit and the great fault of this translation, since the original text is allusive and elliptical in its phrasing. For example, the ancient text appears to have several speakers, but it is not always clear who is speaking at any moment. Because of this, the English translation is at times unclear. The imagery of Jeanne Lim's lean interpretation of this poem is nevertheless powerful and rich, comparable to Han Frankel's translation of this poem, and quite a relief from the excesses of Arthur Waley. I recommend it highly."
3,"Good Mu Lan book, but not my favorite illustrated version.","Out of the many Mu Lan books I have this is nice, but is not my favorite books. I do like how the illustrations are more traditional Chinese looking but the orange / yellow background colors just miss the mark for my taste. I like bright vivid colors which is why I prefer China's Bravest Girl: The Legend of Hua Mu Lan by Chin instead. Both are similar in story, the colors seem to pop in this book where the yellow looks like a yellowed parchment pages."
1,No warrenty,"The heater started out to be a good thing. We owned two of them for years now. Only problem is if it breaks down, you have ZERO recourse. The company would appear to have dropped off the face of the earth. My heater broke down, I sent it in (as I had done in the past) with a $20 check, only to have it returned to me with ""No such address"" stamped on the box. When I tried to call the phone numbers, one is a ""you won a prise you lucky devil"" type message and the other is just plain disconnected. Buyer be ware."
1,Don't buy this!!!,"I purchased this heater through Amazon.com from heatersusa. The shutoff switch did not work and the company told me to contact the manufacturer. Only problem - the manufacturer no longer exists. I've tried 2 other manufacturers that supposedly made this &/or took over the Del-Rain Corp., but they've returned the heater saying it isn't theirs. Heatersusa won't respond except to say ""it's not our problem"". Biggest problem: THIS ISN'T EVEN THE HEATER I ORDERED - THEY SWITCHED IT!!!"
4,A perfect Missal for young Catholics,"A children's Missal which is perfect for the younger child, this would make a wonderful First Communion present. Easy to read text makes following the Mass simple and meaningful. A wonderful first missal for young Catholics!"
1,OUT DATED,THis book needs serious updating. I think it was published about 1982 and it shows. Was looking for a missal for my daughter. This was so bad we don't even use it.
3,Good information if you are familar with the plants,"I liked the information presented in this book but would have liked to see a larger photograph of the plants. Most of the book is black and white with a section of small photographs of the plants. I cannot see leaf definition or perhaps even the look of fruits or blooms. In books of plants that someone like me, from another part of the US, needs more detailed photographs to be truly helpful."
3,really about Hitler,"Hitler sounds like Nietzsche in the Preface of this book, calling Christianity a Jewish sect and promising to free humankind from the whip of a God who would enslave people with commandments. Nietzsche elevated such thoughts by having a literary inside out philosophy to go with it. Thomas Mann pictures Moses going up the mountain again as the dashing Joshua took care of the executions the golden calf had made necessary. God wanted to ""annihilate these people, who were as miscast as the golden calf and as incorrigible."" It is on page 67."
3,My Niece,The reason that I got this one was that I hadn't seen it and Bobbie Phillips is my niece.I try to get everything that she did.
3,For Bobbie Phillips fans,"I came across this low budget western on cable one night and recorded it out of curiosity. A good call on my part seeing I have liked lead actress Bobbie Phillips ever since I saw her on an episode of the X-Files as a bug expert. I believe this is her first leading role, but it's nothing to write home about. The plot - about a ruthless gunrunner trying to find his cheating wife and the money she stole from him - could have worked if they had a better script, better actors and a bigger budget. As it is, the action sequences are laughable and the dialogue makes you groan. They scraped the bottom of the barrel by getting MC Hammer to play a bounty hunter, together with a mute dwarf!Cheyenne's only saving grace is Bobbie Phillips, who is not shy about showing some skin. You may remember Ms. Phillips as one of the background characters in Showgirls - she's one of the strippers at the club Elizabeth Berkley moonlights at before her big break. The three stars are for Bobbie!"
1,Garbage,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. Don't waste your time or money on this one. If I could, I'd give it zero stars."
3,it's okay...,"this bracket system is not as solid as I thought it would be. It is a little wobbly, actually, although I did install them into studs."
5,Remember the Summer!,"The Ministry of Sound does it again with a fantastic collection of the top summer tunes from 2003. CD1 is more in the house/lounge style, while CD2 takes it up a notch with bangin' trance and electronic anthems. This is the perfect CD for the summer."
5,I Liked this album A LOT,"I found this album (the twilight one, wich stands for the CD02) very good, indeed. Some lounge/house tracks, wich make you want to dance, bute still in a light speed. CD01 is slowlyier, but also nice."
1,disappointed,I find a significant reduction in performance with these cable compared to the cables I was replacing. I am disappointed and hope to able to return them. Data transfer is unreliable.
2,Worked just one time.,"The cable appears fine. There are no physical deformations on the connection ends nor on the cable. Using the Tripp Lite cable, I made a data transfer between an external Firewire enclosure hard disk and computer. Transfer went well. No adjustments were made with the computer and external HD Tripp Lite connection. Subsequent attempts to access the external HD were unsuccessful. Switching the cable's ends between the computer and external HD did not change the problem. I bought a replacement Firewire cable (9pin/9pin-6ft), not a Tripp Lite, and the replacement cable has had no problem working with the computer and external HD. The Tripp Lite cable proved defective."
5,Easy transfer from one computer to another,Did just as I expected to transfer my setup from my old computer to my new one.Much faster than wi-fi
2,you pay for what you get...,i bought this cable knowing it prob wouldn't last and i was right. worked ok for the first few weeks and now does not keep a consistent connection. Plug is a very flimsy plastic and not a hardened. i'd recommend spending the few extra dollars for a quality cable. thankfully my bluray external can use usb
3,Didn't come in the advertised packaging but still works,"When it comes to cables, you typically don't comment on their quality unless it fails, mine works, so no complaints."
5,It did what it was supposed to do,"I bought this Firewire 800 cable to transfer all the data from my older MacBook Pro to my new iMac. Once I realized I had to turn my MacBook Pro into a hard drive rather than a computer, the transfer started and in less than two hours all 250 Gig of my MacBook Pro's soul had been transferred to my new iMac.This cable performed flawlessly."
3,Disappointed!,I guess you get what you pay for. The cable is wiggly and doesn't seem secure! I'm not sure it's any better than the other one that was worn out
1,ARE YOU SERIOUS???,"i wouldnt even give this song 1 star....this rapper is horrible ""the next eminem""???? what?? this kid isnt even the next benzino. this rapper is horrible and why do all his positive reviews sound more like album promotions, then real people saying what they think of the song. sounds like this dood got his friends and producers entering fake reviews. these lyrics are hoooooooorrible. for anyone to compare him to eminem has to be out of there mind!!!"
4,Anxious for the release,"Everyone has people who hate 'em but whatever. It's a real change from what I normally listen to. No cursing! Just because he's white doesn't make me think he's the next Em tho. I think the boi has talent. I like the sound and the lyrics. It makes me think of summer ass shakin music. Presonally, I like 'Rock Ya Body' better. (...I got an idea... and it might sound silly but I wanna roll ya body in a tight brown phillie... crack it... lick it up... seal it air tight... get a light...) Love it! Those who like 'Roll Wit MVP' should listen to it. I think the CD should be out sooner though. I'd really like to see what it's all about and where he's gonna go. Also... Daymn! The boi is sexie! Those eyes are something else! *muah*"
3,So-so,"This song is okay. I really don't think it's as bad as people say it is. But I think people that are calling him ""the next Eminem"" ARE getting ahead of themselves; at the same time, though, people calling this the worst song of (last) year are kind of getting ahead of themselves, too. Still, it IS funny to read some of the backlash, like the reviewer that said he's not even going to be the next Benzino, or when VIBE magazine listed Stagga first for the Fred Durst ""Put the Mic Down, Whitey"" Award. All in all, though, it seems like this is another case where very heavily mixed reviews keep an album from coming out (we haven't seen Q-Tip's Kamaal the Abstract on the shelves, have we?).Anthony Rupert"
3,Who the hell is that?,"First off, the song is aight. Makes me shake my bootay a lil. However, I want to know who the girl singing the ""la la la la"" part on the video is. She's smoking. If anyone knows out there, email me at justforslaps23@yahoo.com. Dayyyuuummmmm she's hot. Please help a brother out, oops, I mean ""bra"" out. Haha."
4,Not Bad,I actually thought this song was pretty good. The beat actually sounds good and the lyrics are in place. He still isn't Eminem though
5,STAGGA LEE - ROLL WIT MVP (SINGLE) REVIEW,"Stagga Lee is the next great white rapper!!! He reminds me of Eminem. Stagga just does not have the attitiude of Eminem. His mic skills are almost like Em's. When I first saw Stagga on BET's Uncut, I have been hunting down the single ever since! Luckily enough, I found it yesterday ..."
1,DIZ WIGGA HAZ HIZ GAME ON LOCK!!!!!!!!!!!...................,"good thing they keep pushing his cd bakk. this wigga sux, tha song sux and he is sighned 2 sum unknown record label full of......nvm. i recommend benzino's redmempion (which iz 1 of tha worst rappers alive go onto the source.com go 2 forums and see how much he gets dissed) or kids bob 2 is bette (lol). dont waste money on it then brake ur paper shredder trying 2 rid of it. im out ~1~ love"
4,"intimate, warm, spanish","Warm spanish acoustic guitar and steady conga accompany a female singer sometimes with male background singers. Nice groove through and through. Would have helped perhaps if I'd understood Spanish, but even so, I fully enjoyed this album. And I do like the sound of Spanish even if I don't understand most of it.Obviously latin, think gypsy jazz tinged peruvian folk ballads - and you are somewhere in the neighborhood. Towards the end of the album we given a taste of similar musical flavors over beat laced electronica which works quite smoothly and somehow manages to keep in character with the warmth and liquid clarity of what preceded. Not bad."
2,Noise maker...,"I suppose I expected a little more form this toy/instrument, but in the end it's just an annoying noise maker. My children's interest didn't last long."
1,Disappointed,"I have used this product for many years and love it. However, when I ordered it from this supplier, the description said that it would come in a box in its original package. It did not. CAVEAT EMPTOR...."
1,Not nearly as interesting as it should be,"Giants have been objects of fascination throughout human history, but Cohen's book is burdened with theoretical cultural studies jargon and a pretentious writing style that destorys and interest. The book seems to be more about the authors ego that a desire to entertain or educate. A waste of money."
4,Definitly worth buying!!,"This game is REALLY GOOD!This game has several new features like creating your own arena or creating a you (and yes a you)that experience's as you experience,hard to explain you have to get it to understand.Over 200 new part to customize.And plus if you have the game ARMORED CORE 3 you can load your old AC's(Robots) to this game that would make everything a whole lot easier.There are also destructable weapons this making you're opponent vunerable and easier to kill.So If you have the money buy this game and AC3 if you dont have the game."
3,An ok game,This game is sort of pointless since you cant get past the 4th level but if your into AI and putting combat machines togher this is the game for you!!! The thing I liked about it was its storyline yet the weird thing is the weopons follow some of the other earlyer Armored Core games.
4,Dover Clip Art books are getting better all the time,"The recent ""Full Color -------Vignettes"" series by Dover represents a significant step up in quality from the earlier Dover clip art series [generally done in black and white] The publisher is undoubtedly responding to a progressively more sophisticated market for clip art and craft [decoupage] products. These are copyright free images, printed on one side of a good quality paper designed for decoupage or collage work.Definitely a great deal at the price."
5,Great Drives,"I lived in this area for 3 years and traveled it on my own quite a bit. This year I went for a vacation and took along this book. I loved the drives that were off the beaten track and the tips on more scenic ways to get to a destination. I would recommend this book for anyone traveling in the area and know that the suggestions are good. I also like how they rated each drive by different scales on scenery, history, catles, etc. It is a nice recap of the area and helps you select where you might want to go."
4,"Surprisingly good, concise guide!","This is a very useful book, I was surprised at its depth and information. Whether you've spent lots of time in Bavaria or are a newcomer, these drives are almost all excellent, off the beaten track and easily nagivated. The maps included are more than adequate, it's almost impossible to get lost. The authors throw in little tips, such as nice inns to stay at or good restaurants along the way. I've spent a lot of time driving in Bavaria and Austria and this book was a truly pleasant surprise. If you love Bavaria and you like beautiful drives, I highly recommend this."
3,Not the Brembo I'm use to.,Disc's warped within 6 to 8 months. I have since purchased top of the line from local parts store....no issues.
3,not good,"I had to get this book for an irish history class. It was not the best book to read pretty dry, but filled with alot of detail and facts."
3,Love will prevail,"'Joanna didn't know what to expect... Necessity forced Joanna Seton to accept a position as governess to Jake Sheldon's daughter (Anya).She set out for Ravensgarth, his farm in the Lake District, with a determination to make the best of what she found.What she found was a man whose scarred face reflected his battered life-who has cut himself off from all social contacts. His daughter, too, had suffered. She was a wild, uncontrollable child.Even though both of them seemed to hate her, Joanna's heart went out to these two survivors of past tragedy!'"
5,book review,"Every year for the past six years, I have taught a novel unit in the public school system using The Mouse and His Child, and every year, it is my favorite part of the school year. This is the perfect book for every age group from elementary to high school. I seriously recommend it for home schools. The topics range from the meaning of freedom to an understanding of eternity. There is God and Science, and a battle between good and evil where good really wins and even the evil is converted rather than destroyed. Every year I continue teaching because of this book, and every year, I learn something new from it!"
1,Scarred for Life,"Although I have not read this book - I have seen the animated feature film from 1977, which I watched as a 4-5 year old child. I can still vividly remember how dark and bleak this movie was, and how the entire cinema of children were crying hysterically. I was not a particularly ""fragile"" child, but to think of this movie, even now, I get a horrible tight feeling in my chest and an overwhelming sense of despair. The book may not have been written in this way, but looking at the other reviews I believe it is, so I would strongly caution anyone before offering this book to their children to read."
3,The last visible dog review,"As an adult who has read a lot of books to kids I can't rate this one in the top list. It was a gift to my kids so we read it but, even on all those ""deep"", ""stuck in the mud"" stuff that's in this book as an adult, I get it, the kids didn't. Instead they weren't too thrilled following the misery of their lives nor the redemption in the end. But we've read worse. So on that vein, it's a 3 star not a 2 star.Reading this book is like listening to a story by a very old grumpy guy telling it. You can't quite peel away but you aren't really all that interested, and then, it gets interesting and then your thoughts wander off...On the manufacture of the book, the paper is wonderful stuff. The dust jacket nicely done. I liked the illustrations, I thought they went well with the story. The type is easy to read. It feels nice in the hand. Would all book publishers take this care."
3,"bleak, grim and despairing","This is NOT a book for children. There is no positive lesson to be learned from this story, there is no inspiration, nor optimism. This book is a grim allegory, full of allusions to the real world of war and murder. This is a fairy tale as envisioned by Camus.As a mature adult I am glad to have read the story and will probably re-read it to enjoy the grim and amusing picture it paints of our world gone mad, but I would never inflict this book on a child of any age."
2,This book made me miserable,"I still remember the experience of reading this book, which I got as an Xmas present when I was ... what? 10 or 11? I found it the most unbearably sad thing I'd ever read; I'd keep trying to read a little further but a black cloud of gloom would descend over me and I'd cry uncontrollably for hours. I still remember the experience with horror. Now, maybe I was a bit oversensitive as a child, and maybe the book really is as good as the other reviews say (and as an adult with a bit thicker skin I'm curious to try reading it again, especially now that I have children of my own who are in love with Hoban's ""Frances"" books) but let my experience serve as a warning about giving this book to children without adequate supervision."
4,Splendor in the grass,"I am not an ""outdoorsy"" person at all. I can't stand being dirty or seeing bugs. But I AM from Appalachia, so I picked up this book. I was hooked by chapter 2. By the time I lay the book down, I wanted to make love to my husband in the grass, and (GASP) I spared a moth's little life when he somehow landed on my scanner. When a book manages to change something inside us, or move something inside us, it is a good book."
3,Entertaining read after a slow start,"This was my first Kingsolver novel, given to me by a friend. I had high expectations based on reviews of The Poisonwood Bible, which I intend to read very soon. I liked the major themes of the book and I enjoyed the rich development of her characters and their inter-relationships, although the dialogue seemed a bit pedantic at times. I thought her depiction of life in the Southeast region was quite realistic. After a slow start, I found the book entertaining."
3,A Mixed Review,"Barbara Kingsolver has been my favorite author ever since I discovered Animal Dreams, so I was eager to read Prodigal Summer. I think that this is the book she wanted to write for a long time, but it wouldn't have gotten past an editor until the success of Poisonwood Bible. There are surely moments of lyrical writing on every page, and I regularly gasped (yes, gasped!) in appreciation of her language. That said, I felt like I was reading LaVyrle Spencer or Danielle Steele, not that I do, way too often. Her message got way ahead of her medium. I loved Garnett and Nannie, but Lusa and Deanna felt plastic. I agree fully with Kingsolver's world view, and will recommend this book to fellow readers, with the caveat that they should not expect Kingsolver's best work, but surely one of her most passionate."
2,Not Kingsolver's Best,"A few years ago I read The Poisonwood Bible, which sent me on a quest for other books by Barbara Kingsolver. It was that good. I took a break for a few years and now read Prodigal Summer. I'm not sure if I was expecting better, but this book was truly mediocre. There are three stories that are intertwined in rather predictable ways. The story and the characters are not to my liking. The treatment of women as somehow superior beings, deeply in touch with the natural world and always intimately connected with their environment, turns me cold. Women who I know are much more down to earth than Kingsolver's Mother Earth types. That said, the writing is good and the story moves along at a rapid pace. Prodigal Summer is not a washout, but it is disappointing."
4,Kingsolver touches our common soul,"Kingsolver's brilliant use of story to explore nature, interconnectedness, human nature, story, and finding the highest within ourselves shines in this book. Of her books, both fiction and non-fiction, that I have read, and I have read most of them, this is one of my top two. This excellent read will stay with you long after the book returns to the shelf."
5,one of the best,I read Prodigal Summer a couple years ago and it is still one of my favorite reads ever -- highly recommended!
1,BlaBlaBla,"I was so disappointed in this book. After Poisonwood Bible I was expecting rich characters, exciting plots and a direction. In this book, I found a lecture on the biology of ecology, or she took someone's research and tried to fit it into a novel. I almost quit after the 4th chapter but decided that she would go somewhere with this at the end - tie it all up or weave it together. Nothing like that happened. Dont bother to finish if you get bored at the beginning. It doesnt get better. A waste of my time."
5,A Wonderful Read,"I read a great deal and I really loved this book. I loved the language, the characters, and the story. It's definitely a book I will treasure and read again."
2,"should be ""prodigal author!""",this is the worst book Kingsolver has written. It's shallow. I wonder why it was ever written.... contract?
1,Nobody's Perfect,"I thought Barbara Kingsolver could do no wrong until I read this novel. She is still my favorite author, but this book tanks! It was like reading an ecology textbook with lots of sex scenes. If I had to read it for a college ecology class, I'm sure it would have been more interesting than the other text books out there, but as a novel for a typical person, looking for a great read, it was a real disappointment.Save your money, buy any of Barbara's awesome books but this one. My personal favorite is High Tide in Tucson, but they are all wonderful. Read Prodigal Summer only if you'd like academic credit and you can stay awake through boring text."
3,Review Prodigal Summer,I had ordered this same product from Ebay and never received it. This was a book club read so I was very glad when I received it in a short time. Thanks Amazon
2,Got halfway through and just simply couldn't finish,"Prodigal Summer was a book picked by a friend of mine for our book club. We were all really excited as Kingsolver has a strong following and critics seem to love her. Needless to say from my review title I couldn't even finish it - I got to page 200 but with much effort. Her nature writing is nice (although probably boring and not for everyone) but her romance writing is really ""cheesy"" (think Harlequin romance) found in the section titled ""Predators"" - it was almost nauseating. ""Moth love"" was just depressing and the other section which I can't even remember the title of was, well, not very memorable... I was thinking maybe it was just me but several other members of our book club ""hated it"" and only 1 or 2 of the ladies even finished it. I didn't give the book 1 star b/c I admit that maybe I am missing something but this book just left me bored and wishing for more of a plot and better characters."
1,nothing prodigious here,"i haven't been this disappointed in a book in quite some time. there was nothing complex, nothing moving...nothing prodigious about this novel. it was a painful read...the sex trashy, the relationships for the most part underdeveloped...the most promising characters too peripheral for my tastes. it didn't feel like kingsolver at all. and the worst thing? this novel was too easy...far too transparent, maps drawn neatly across the pages as though the reader needed a forest services-esque guide to ""get it"". i found this book lacking in meaning, depth and breadth. i had to re-read The Poisonwood Bible, The Bean Trees, Pigs in Heaven and High Tide in Tucson just to feel better about having wasted my time."
3,Not my favorite Kingsolver work,"Kingsolver is probably the author I admire the most. If I could write a novel like the Poisonwood Bible I would die satisfied with my contribution to the world. Prodigal Summer is full of symbolism and provokes thought, but not to the extent of PB. I also did not enjoy the author's voice in this text as much as I usually do. For a more enjoyable read try the two books featuring the lovable Turtle, ""The Bean Trees"" and ""Pigs in Heaven""."
5,"Amazing Book Combination of Art, Biology, and Politics","Many don't know that Barbara Kingsolver was a Biology student at the University of Arizona. So naturally her novels are appealing to both literature and biology fanatics. I had the opportunity to visit a Book Reading of Ms. Kingsolver in Tucson, Arizona. After seeing her read a few chapters and also asserting the importance of our enviornment, I read this book over again. There are many chapters which have hidden meanings dealing with the enviornment, or about the tobacco industry. Art can be used to influence politics. Her book is in a sense an activism of its own. I think I'd really recommend this book to science students as well as students who really don't read books that often."
2,Kingsolver Pushes Her Agenda,"I am a long time Kingsolver fan, but found this book thoroughly disappointing. Flat, predictable characters spouting repitious environmentalist propaganda is not my idea of a good read. I'm from Kentucky farm country and believe in the cause wholeheartedly; I just didn't find the delivery interesting. If you're just getting introduced to Barbara Kingsolver, do yourself a favor and read her other books first. I gave it two stars because I finished it."
1,Preachy Summer,"Unless you are a 40+ woman who hasn't had sex in a while, and enjoys a simplistic look on environmental issues, skip this one.... Unfortunately, I knew enough about the issues to resent the simplistic, didactic lecturing by her ""characters"" that saturates the novel. It would be great if we could all be rich hippies who could afford to buy organic everything, and have no impact on our environment - but get real!!In addition, she boxes her female characters into the role of educating the men. Her male characters are either niave, stupid, or just [frisky], and the ""enlightened"" women seem to just use them for sex and arguments. The [explicit] sex scenes border on offensive, and if I was somehow stuck listening to this book with my mother, I would be beet red the entire time."
1,Couldn't finish this book,"I have read all of Kingsolver's books, and I think that the quality of her writing is going continuously downward. The writing I found to be so cliché-ish, I could not stomach reading more than the first 80 pages. Because the plot seemed so predictable, and the characters so flat, I went to the last 20 pages, certain I knew what would happen anyway. What happened in between could not even have been as good as I imagined. I was disappointed even with the last 20 pages. I think Kingsolver is probably a better writer than this book showed. It seemed she was either writing quickly to meet a publisher's deadline, or writing the book with the hopes that a film could be made of it."
3,Prodigal Summer,"I ended with no particular fondness or disdain for any character. I didn't find them fascinating or entertaining. I enjoyed Kingsolver's knowledge of nature, however."
3,Slow and tedious read,"While I find Barbara Kingsolver a good writer, she gets the reader too tangled in the bushes sometimes with her excessive extraneous detail about nature. Some is good, basic knowledge, but going overboard makes some of her books -- this one and 'Flight Behavior' -- a slow and tedious read. Not a page-turner by any means."
5,A great read,Kingsolver has skilfully intertwined three parallel themes and incorporated environmental issues seamlessly. I could not put the book down and then did not want to finish it.
4,Another Easily Recognized Kingsolver Novel,"I have read most of Kingsolver's works, and THE BEAN TREES remains my favorite of her novels. PRODIGAL SUMMER is Kingsolver's most sensuous novel. I enjoyed the ecology theme and her out-of-the-mainstream characters. Some of the conversations are stilted and a bit like listening to a lecture, but overall, this book is a good read."
1,Preaching to the choir,"I am a huge fan of Kingsolver, but I felt this book was, well, boring. The writing itself was not up to par with her other works, it seemed hastily thought out and just as hastily written. For the strong or even moderate environmentalist, this book is a kindergarten class look at morality - good for those who haven't thought this stuff through a hundred times already."
4,Mixed feelings about this one,"I've read and liked all of Barbara Kingsolver's books. One might think that the subject of this one (saving one little corner of the world from pesticides and killers of endangered species) would appeal to me even more than other readers as I have chemical sensitivities, acquired, probably, from exposure to pesticides. I felt that I was being force-fed an agenda, however, and as much as I liked the characters, I resented being reminded not so subtly about the dangers of pesticides and coyote hunters. That said, Kingsolver still manages to weave the lives of three interesting people together in an intriguing way, and I was sorry when the book ended."
4,Nature thrives in this wonderful story,"Once I read Barbara Kingsolver's ""The Poisonwood Bible"", I began reading all her books. The Prodigal Summer was a bit of a let down for me. It was a wonderful story, but I didn't think it was up to her standard. Normally, her characters are well-developed but in this story they just seemed to be lost in the message of organic farming and other environmental issues by the author. These are important subjects and they are told very well as only the biologist writer can do. However, these issues just came across as a bit too patronizing and relationship that I had hoped would develop with the characters just seemed to be fuzzy. Still, the book was an excellent read. There was a bit good humor, an unbelievable insight into the feelings and emotions of women and a priceless education and view of the world of nature. All this rolled up into a wonderful story."
4,"wonderful reading - great characters, but too preachy","I must admit, this was the most enjoyable read in a long time.... I believe the characters came to life, and each of the 3 intertwined stories were simply very interesting. I thought Barbara did a wonderful job making the reader feel as if they were up on the mountain, or down on the Widener farm ... and I loved each of the characters - as an aside - I could picture Mr. Walter as Walter Mathhau in Grumpy Old Men!!!! I have read a few of Barbara's novels and each have been on the preachy side, and this was no different. Overall, it only slightly distracted from the novel - but I was a bit annoyed to have to hear the same argument 3 times about herbivore v. predator ... and in equal depth ... I think the reader got it the first time. On a positive note, at least I feel like i walk away from Barbara's books more knowledgable about the subject matter at hand, which is more than what could be said about most fictional writing."
5,One of my favorite books,"Fiction is supposed to take you to another world and give you the feeling of being in that world. I felt like I was with these characters and felt their pain and triumph and love.I highly recommend this book, especially as the summer months approach."
3,Lovely,"Notice, I wrote lovely and not amazing or great. This is a very pleasant read. Something for a quiet afternoon or maybe a plane ride or just sitting in the sun. There is not much drama going on here. It flip flops from one person to another and doesnt come together in the end at all. It is three short stories in one book. Nothing dramatic at all. No high, suspensful moments and no low ones either. Just enough to keep up the curiosity of the reader going. This doesnt come close to ""Poisonwood Bible"". Now that is one book I DO recommend."
5,Human/Nature,"Beautiful book...she blends the natural world with the world of people so skillfully that sometimes there is no distinction. We are, after all, animals."
4,A wonderfully worthwhile endeavor.......,"I have now read all of Barbara Kingsolver's novels, and I have enjoyed each of them on their own terms.Prodigal summer is a fantastic novel. It is real, sensuous, and true-to-life. While reading this book I felt transplanted to the arena of the mountains and the countryside, and transported into the minds of the main characters. The drama and pain of the characters is balanced and well illustrated against the isolation of the rural countryside.If you like books, read Prodigal Summer. If you like Barbara Kingsolver, read Prodigal Summer. It is worth your time."
1,Disappointing,"Lacking a passion for either coyotes or moths, I was unable to finish this. As a rule, I believe that readers who don't finish a book should not review it so do not weigh this review too heavily. The Poisonwood Bible, Kingsolver's last book, was an incredible work of literature and one of the best books I've ever read. I opened Prodigal Summer with high expectations of being treated to an equally compelling novel, and I think many fans of the earlier book will do the same. If you intend to read this, throw those expectations out the window and perhaps you'll see more merit in it than I did. This is just my opinion - I'm sure that other readers will have differing opinions, and I look forward to reading them here. If I've erred in my assessment of Prodigal Summer after reading about half of it, please write a review...do I need to give it more time?"
1,Lecturing is not literature,"I have never read a Kingsolver novel before and was told by a number of her fans that her books are excellent. Perhaps it was my misfortune to start with this one. From the opening chapter I felt that Kingsolver was forcing the story to fit into a lecture on the environment. Her agenda is so obvious that the characters and the stories of their lives are stilted and secondary to the lecture. Ms Kingsolver seems to have decided that she is a messenger for nature. She has clearly chosen to regard her audience as one which needs to have sex, heat and lust thrown in to make the sermon easier to digest. A boring book which fails to do anything other than annoy the reader. There are far better books which use the backdrop of the environment in danger as a setting for characters which capture the reader's attention."
3,Good but lacks the impact of Poisonwood,"I've spent the last two years lending out my copy of Poisonwood Bible to the point the cover is tattered. Somehow I don't think Prodigal Summer will meet the same fate. Not that it's a bad book. It just lacks the power of Poisonwood. Perhaps it's due to the less exotic setting.Still, Kingsolver actually makes the triple and parallel plot device work pretty well. I didn't expect to like the ""Old Chesnuts"" plot but it was the one I looked forward to most by the end. While the eroticism of ""Predators"" was fun, Deanna's preachiness wore thin quickly. And while it wasn't exactly a fun read, I suspect that Lusa and the ""Moth Love"" story line may actually linger the longest.I read this for a book club and it produced the good (but not great) discussion common when everyone in the group is essentially in agreement about liking the book. I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars if the system allowed."
2,If it were possible to give it 100 stars I would,Rare that I read a book twice but just read for fourth time. The way Kingsolver weaves three separate lives together is masterful.
3,Kept waiting,Enjoyed story line and character development but kept waiting to tie everything together. Disappointed with the ending. It could have had a terrific ending but it is missing.
4,Nature lover,"Buy it,the book is worth your time. I live in a rural area, and bald eagles, coyotes, deer, racoons, otters, and all sorts of birds have been known to visit my front yard. I don't feed them , but they find enough to eat. Read this novel if you like animals, plants, or any sort of nature."
3,Where's the Magic?,"Animal Dreams is still my favorite book and I keep hoping Barbara Kingsolver will thrill me with stories like that as she did with Bean Trees and Pigs in Heaven. I didn't talk to anyone that liked Poisonwood Bible so I did not read it so I was anxiously awaiting her next one. Well, while Prodigal Summer is well-written and has a story and I learned many new things and eventually enjoyed the interweaving of the different characters it just lacked the magic of her earlier works. I think Barbara is inspired by her life experiences and healed herself a tremendous amount when she was writing her earlier books. Now that she has healed,is successful and has reaped the well-deserved rewards she has looked elsewhere for inspiration. Reading her poetry will reveal her depth to you and if she further explores her inner world I expect her to continue to be the excellent writer that she is."
2,"I agree with ""preachy""","I am a Kingsolver fan from way back but I found this book annoying. She climbed up on her soapbox on the first page and never got down. I felt like the book was nothing more than her personal views on women and the environment poorly disguised as fiction.I must add that the whole Deanna/Eddie Bondo relationship was rediculous. We are supposed to believe that this forty-something woman is so out of touch with civilization that she never looks in a mirror (nor bathes, that I could tell) or listens to the radio. Yet she is wildly attractive to a 28 year old ""Adonis"". I don't think so.Being an environmentalist too, I appreciate Kingsolver's attempt to be an advocate through her medium. However, I'm looking for something else (like a real story) in my leisure time reading."
4,Ripple effect,"Along with the ""web of life"" analogy prevalent in Prodigal Summer, there is the ""ripple effect."" Kingsolver has always touched my special nerves, but this time with something new--that ""ripple effect"" in which she fed my imagination after I was done reading the book. We often say ""I wished this story could have gone on"" and in this case it did for me. As I went about my business after finishing the book, I realized I was seeing how each of the three stories played out. In her ""prodigal"" way, Kingsolver lavishly spent all those details on me, the reader, until they just kept spilling out even after it was over."
2,"get it? WHACK? Okay, how about now?","As a reader who loved the Poisonwood Bible, I was very disappointed by this book.Altough I agree with the messages in the book, I found it to be preachy and heavyhanded. I agree with other reviewers who found the characters shallow and the writing simple. As for the romantic moments in the story--bizzarre, and not in a good way.My impression of this book was that it was written quicky to fulfill a contract, or written early in the writer's career and shoved in a drawer until it was dusted off to ride on the success of the Poisonwood Bible. It certainly is a contrast to that book, which seemed to have alot of time, research and thought behind it."
3,Not quite as good as previous Kingsolver novels,"When I saw this new Kingsolver book, I just had to plunk out the money for it, something I usually don't do for a hardcover. I am a great Kingsolver fan, even buying all the females in my family copies of Animal Dreams and Poisonwood Bible, but I was somewhat disappointed with this one. It was a fairly good book, just not what one would expect from a fantastic writer like Kingsolver. Maybe it was a bit of writer's block and pressure after the huge success of Poisonwood. It would be hard to write another book as great as it is. ""Summer"" was worth reading, but I wish I'd waited for it at the library rather than paying for it. If you've not read Kingsolver before, I would highly recommend Animal Dreams as a place to start, rather than this one."
3,A huge disappointment!,"The Poisonwood Bible was my first exposure to Barbara Kingsolver, and immediately after reading it I decided she was now my favorite author. I then read everything else she had written before Poisonwood and was not disappointed. So it was with great anticipation that I purchased this novel and settled down to read it.What a chore that was. ZZzzzzzzz. While her past novels all had important messages on the environment, racism, materialism, etc. woven into them, Kingsolver's earlier stories were engaging, with strong believable characters. No one could fault the author for her passionate views. However, while reading Prodigal Summer, I felt like I was being force fed a lesson on the ecosystem--thinly disguised as a novel. Throw in a few sex scenes and maybe the readers won't realize they're being preached to about organic farming, save the bugs, save the coyotes, save the snakes, blah, blah, blah. I wanted a novel, not a science book."
3,"Lovely language, but...","I recently listened to this book on tape over one weekend. As it happens, my son is reading The Bean Trees in high school. As much as I love Kingsolver's prose, by the end of this book I was left with a feeling of uneasiness. The novel feels quite didactic. In particular, the male characters aren't well developed. Deanna's lover seems to exist mostly as a cardboard figure to enable Deanna (or Kingsolver) to lecture on the environment, and of course, ... I think some judicious editing could have stengthened and tightened the novel. In contrast, The Bean Trees seems to have stood the test of time quite well, and I'm enjoying reading it aloud with my son. In part, I think, it's because there Kingsolver shows us characters developing and changing, whereas in Prodigal Summer she does an awful lot of telling."
4,Wonderful Story Cut Short,"Kingsolver uses her talented descriptive voice to tell three very different, yet connected, stories of admiration. While the main story of the novel itself is absolutely beautiful, I was disappointed with the ending which happened too soon and in an awkward way. Of course, this may be a convention of the author used to force the reader to continue the story for herself; but still, I would have liked to find out what happens to the characters when they all eventually meet."
2,Not My Favorite,"I was disappointed in this story. Poisonwood Bible is a favorite of mine so I was looking forward to Prodigal Summer. I liked some of it but most of it I found annoying. Are only females allowed to be the strong ones? The men in the story seemed evil, weak or dead. Mostly they followed the scent of a woman like animals without any ideas of a relationship or love."
2,loved the book but the electronic (kindle) version had too many errors,"Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful author and Prodigal Summer doesn't fail to enchant, but the Kindle version has too many errors (misspelled words, sentences that don't make sense because of missing words) that shouldn't be there given the price of the book. Amazon needs to look into quality control. I love all the advantages of my Kindle and use it all the time, but I'm getting very tired of books missing random chapter headings, goofed up punctuation, etc. I'm forgiving if the book is inexpensive, but $9.99 and above -- no way! The electronic versions of books that we buy from Amazon should be as carefully edited as the paper versions. Amazon, it's time to hold the publishers' feet to the fire!"
3,Not backing this one,"While I really appreciate Kingsolver's work, I can't say I like Prodigal Summer. Another reviewer suggested that it was ""too preachy"". I have to agree in a lot of ways. I mean, there was a lot of ""save the environment"" and ""don't use pesticides, it gives everyone cancer"". But there was no good resolution. There was a lot of talk and nothing to back it up. I am not hunter either; I hate hunting. So I got that part. But the rest....eh.... And I really thought it was silly to suggest that one of the main gals appeal was that she was ovulating. I couldn't get behind this one."
5,Great story,"Funny, descriptive, real characters make this romp thru the bushes a really good read. Love all the plant and animal descriptions."
4,loved it,"Great writing. Kept me interested from page 1, though I wish she wrapped it up a little more at the end."
4,Glad I read it,"Much lovely information about nature, both plant and animal life. good character development. Moves along fairly grippingly and with several twists that delight."
3,Typical Kingsolver,Descriptive language is entertainingStory is complicated and sometimes difficult to follow the characters through the chapters.Ending leaves something to be desired
3,Definitely has some good points,"The first time I read this book, I was working at a job where I was allowed to read if I didn't have anything else to do. One day, I had NOTHING else to do, so I picked up this book. The first chapter was so inane and stupid that I nearly threw the book across the room in disgust. However, I was really bored that day and had nothing else to do for three hours, so I decided to keep reading. The story got pretty good after that! I thought the idea about Jews, Christians and Muslims being like relatives who fight over different versions of an inheritance story was great. So was the idea about God having enough time to turn a tree into a different kind of tree. So were the conflicting emotions of many of the main characters. I wonder how many people are so turned off by the first chapter that they can't get through a good story."
1,A Harlequin Romance for the Organic Gardener,"Thin plot and flat characters. I think the author forgot to develope the characters, choosing to spew the ""organic"" and ""naturalist"" religion instead. I myself am a firm organic gardener, but I don't think I could have stood another flowery passage describing the importance of bugs and the concepts of predation. The editor failed to do his/her job allowing lengthy descriptions like a garden as having peppers with bright green and red ornaments and eggplants with beautiful purple gifts. (My organic garden certainly doesn't look that way.) The plot seemed like a junior highschool kid's dream of a perfect world in which folks who don't harm nature end up on top. The strings which tie the three stories together are contrived -- they seem to have been added as an afterthought.I thought I was a Kingsolver fan after reading Poisonwood Bible, but this book certainly changed my mind on that."
4,Savor this book,"My only exposure to Kingsolver was Poisonwood Bible -- which I generally liked, but felt sometimes could have been called ""Little Women Go the Africa.""This book is one of the most sensuous I can ever remember reading. The prose is as succulent as a ripe plum. I am NOT a nature lover ... more like Woody Allen, who said ""nature is what I have to walk through to get to my car"" ... yet the vivid observations on flora, fauna and that other earthy f-word captivated me."
5,BARBARA KINGSOLVER OPENS UP ANOTHER CORNER OF THE WORLD,"I HAVE BEEN HONORED TO MEET BARBARA KINGSOLVER...HER PASSION FOR WRITING KEEPS SHINING EVERY TIME SHE WEAVES ANOTHER TALE... IN A SMALL RURAL COMMUNITY OF KENTUCKY LIVES ARE CONNECTED BY BLOOD, BY FATE, BY CIRCUMSTANCE...SEPERATE SCENARIOS PLAY OUT & EVENTUALLY INTERTWINE TO GIFT EACH OTHER ...."
2,Good story idea that grows repetitious.,"I was disappointed in this book because it didn't deliver what it promised. I'm interested in her topics: ecology, the plight of the small American farmer and wildlife. However, the story doesn't develop very well. Kingslover is too long-winded, wordy with long descriptions that are not particularly scholarly or informative; consequently, the book becomes one long serman. Plus the characters are not developed enough to be real. My advice is skip this one. My question is what happened to that wonderful writer who gave us ""Pigs in Heaven""?"
3,Not up to par with Poisonwood,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. At times, Kingsolver's ecological preaching was over-powering and took the place of real plot or character development. But then, I'd read a magnificent passage that would take my breath away. She really is a phenomenal writer-elegant, yet approachable.Of the three slightly entwined stories, I, like many reviewers, preferred ""Moth Love"". Lusa's tale was the most emotionally interesting, and there was evident character growth. The ""Old Chestnuts"" were cute-ish, but a bit cliched. ""Predators"" was my least favorite. Deanna was over-bearing and her continual cycling between lust and guilt grew tiresome.THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is one of my favourite books. I think Kingsolver's a bit off the mark with PRODIGAL SUMMER, though she can still occasionally stun the reader with brilliance."
4,I see nature differently,"I really enjoyed this book and was so glad that I read it. It was thirst quenching somehow. I felt like I bonded with nature and was even inspired to go camping/hiking in the nearby Smoky Mountains soon after finishing this book. It's just a sweet reminder of the balance and beauty of nature.My ONLY complaint was the silly love affair between Deanna Wolfe and Eddie Bondo. (I didn't need to know that they were having sex during their conversations. I would be reading a Harlequin if that's what I was looking for.)Still, I recommend this book. It really was refreshing. After reading it, don't be surprised if you think twice before stepping on a spider or swatting a hornet's nest down!"
5,beautiful,"Over a year later I look back on this book with fondness. It was a beautiful book. I fell in love with the characters, empathizing with personalities I never knew I could understand. I have read hundreds of books, and this one just sticks with me."
4,Enjoyable book,Good story with appreciation for conserving our natural resources and nature's gifts to our world. Interesting characters who are believable.
2,ENDS ABRUPTLY,Too many novelists watch the word count too closely. When they reach their target word count they end the novel as quickly as possible. In this novel Ms Kingsolver does that in spades and if I had known that before purchasing it would not have been bought.
3,A bit too preachy for my taste,"Prodigal Summer is a very good novel that could have been even better had Barbara Kingsolver gotten off her soap box a bit. It tells three stories of people in a small county in Appalachia. The three stories ultimately become intertwined. The novel is extremely well-written; however, I believe her preaching is too extreme at times. The author's characters are all black and white -- no shades of grey. It is obvious which characters are ""right"" and ""wrong"" from the beginning. I only wish Kingsolver had let me figure things out instead of shoving the plot down my throat with such obvious characterizations. All characters come off as being almost stereotypical and much of the plotting is predicable. So why three stars? Kingsolver writes like a dream and Prodigal Summer is an enjoyable read. Read it with a grain of salt and you'll be fine."
4,Forget the ending: read it for the joy of the journey!,"Don't read this book to find out how it ends. Read it for the pure enjoyment of reading. One thing I love about Barbara Kingsolver's books is that I can relate to her main characters' solitude of mind and intellect. Love blossoms from loneliness. Hope blossoms from striving day to day. You'll find yourself yearning for the love interests of the two main characters as if they were your own. The book has a certain harmony to it much like the harmony of life: things are often left unresolved, people cope in the face of unexpected change, and nature continues oblivious to what's going on in my own little piece of life. When I finished reading this book last year, I was disgusted with the ending. But, a year later, I look back and realize that the book could have ended no other way."
2,Agenda driven,"In this book Kingsolver hits you over the head with one agenda or another. I was given this book to read because I told a friend I didn't think Kinsolver liked men. This book didn't prove me wrong. None of the women needed the men in their lives. They were almost entirely attracted to men for sex. If I were a man I would find this book insulting and demeaning. The preachiness of the book totally interferred with any story she was trying to tell. But I don't think she was trying to tell a story, I think she wanted to preach."
3,Boring,"I am an avid reader but had no difficulty putting this book down. I had to force myself to continue reading it. I keep thinking, maybe it will get better. I felt like I was being beaten over the head with the author's belief's. The dialogue was forced so that her information could be presented. I really liked Kingsolver's other books and was terribly disappointed with this one."
4,What happened?,I wrote a lengthy review of this book several weeks ago which has not appeared. Some reviews dated later than mine have appeared. What happened to my review?
1,larry flynt meets barbara kingsolver,"""...delicately wrinkled oval pouches held erect on stems, all the way up the ridge. She pressed her lips together, inclined to avert her eyes from so many pink scrota."" (p.21) After 29 pages, I closed the book and returned it to the library, thankful I hadn't bought it. I've read all of Kingsolver, and this book is trash, at least the first 29 pages are. There's too much good writing out there to struggle through this one just because her other books are fine."
1,?????????,"This was by far, the worst book I have ever read. If there was a way to give it negative stars, I would have. I would not even recommend loaning this for free from the library, its not worth the gas money and the possibility of a late fee, don't bother! If you are politically liberal, then perhaps you might find something to like about this book, but for the rest of us it was a thinly veiled, poorly written, rambling sermon of opinions by the author. I don't ordinarily write reviews, but this book was truly that awful. I did read to the end because I couldn't believe that a published book could be this bad, I thought and hoped (I did spend $9.99 on this!) that there has to be something about the ending.....there isn't. I feel like the author should have paid me to read this!"
4,A very satisfyiing eco-novel,"This low-key eco-novel grew on me, organically, which is fitting given its subject. Parallel story lines all have as a theme the emotional and moral commitment of the characters to sustainable human life in the modern world. It is not in the least preachy, and the characters are not proselytizers, but rather sympathetic personalities seeking to fit into a web of interdependent fellow persons and other life, both animal and vegetable. The forest ranger with a brief for coyotes, the young widow who finds redemption in raising goats and rescuing a girl on the verge of marginalization, the unreconstructed misanthrope who is overcome by his own, fought-against instinct for emotional survival: These are the characters whose tales comprise a very satisfying novel."
5,Relatable,A truly enjoyable story. I was able to relate well with each perspective and that made the read so much more enjoyable!
2,Disappointing after Poisonwood Bible,"I really wanted to like this book. Her descriptions of nature were great. But to me it seemed that her words were merged with the words of a trashy dime store romance. ""Cole made love like a farmer...he had a fine intelligence that drove him toward earthy scents, seeking out with his furred mouth, her soft, damp places, turning her like fresh earth toward the glory of new growth. Her body,...became something new in the embrace of a man who judged breeding animals with his hands..."" I did not find the characters behaved in ways consistant with what an actual person would. To live alone for several years in the forrest, meet someone alone in the woods, barely know their name, and then fall into bed with them, is beyond belief. A good story is ruined by badly written sex scenes."
2,Predictability,"As soon as I got past the first few chapters (which I enjoyed) I realized this was no match for Poisonwood Bible. While it sets a steamy mood--with sex and the climate--the predictability sets in and the characters get boring. After a while nobody and no situation seemed real. The characters were all unidimensional. The sweet smart environmentalists (and I am one!) and the otherwise nice but sadly deluded ""others"". Some of the dialog sounded like it came off a campaign flyer or a Darwin special on PBS. A sadly disappointing book."
2,Waving the white flag!,"OK, OK, I get it already. Everything is connected, everything is dependent. Over and over I get it. Maybe I am being too harsh..I am just saying..the message was repetetive. I felt the only reason for changing characters was to deliver the message again. I listened to this book on tape and found myself zoning out a little, so I can't imagine reading the book. I did learn a few things, but feel a little beat over the head."
1,Bridges of Madison County Meets Farmers' Almanac,"What the heck happened? I bought this in hardcover the minute I heard about it: I am crazy about almost all of Kingsolver's books, ""The Poisonwood Bible"" most of all. I knew it wasn't a good sign when the primary love interest's name was ""Eddie Bondo,"" but there is enough about moth sex (yes, you read that right) and the phallic resemblance of flowers to make Kingsolver sound like the Hugh Hefner of the forest floor. Problem is, there's not much else to this book: the dialogue is hackneyed and predictable, and the plot line is entirely uncompelling. If you have never read Kingsolver, this review is a plea not to begin here. If you have, all I can say is: proceed at your own risk. I personally regret reading a work that has so profoundly compromised my love for this author's stories."
4,Butterfly Lady,"Years ago, in a small Wisconsin city, I met an elderly woman whom I call ""Butterfly Lady."" She introduced me to the joys of observing insects. Also, she is the first person ever to raise luna moths in captivity. I thought about her when I read ""The Prodigal Summer."" Brought back a lot of memories of exploring the world of nature with my children. Also, brought back memories of visiting a cousin who lived on a farm. Brought me back in touch with a lot I had forgotten about the natural world. Also, I enjoyed the characters in the book. Being 75, I was a little amused by the constant references to ""the old man"", when Garnett is only a couple of years older than me. Kingsolver is going to find that life in the seventies is a good deal more exciting than she thinks it is. But that's a minor moan. She could not write a dull book if she tried. I think this is one of her best. It's a book I'll read again. John Purdy, Santa Fe NM"
4,an enjoyable and intelligent read!,"My book club selected this book and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I quickly enjoyed getting to know all 4 main characters, and their stories, and how the book so easily demonstrated how we are all connected -- all people, all nature. I learned so much through this book. Thought provoking, but in a fun way, as one gets into the heads of the characters. Humorous. Soul-ful. Beautifully written."
2,Ecology Textbook,"I had high hopes for this book, having loved Pigs in Heaven and the Poisonwood Bible, and was sadly disappointed. It's too obvious and too predictable. When I read the explanation of the importance of a predator in an ecosystem for the second time I thought I'd jumped into a textbook - and then it came up again! The human parallels to the animal world were just a little strained - the widowed, childless sister-in-law adopts the children of the cancer-ridden mother, and in the animal world just one female coyote will produce offspring while the others support her to maximise the chance of the cubs survival. If I want the ecology lecture I'll pick up a Farley Mowatt book."
5,Wonderful Mountain Story,"Kingsolver's book has been added to my bookshelf alongside my other mountain favorites -- The Man Who Moved a Mountain; Cold Mountain; Orlean Puckett: The Life of a Mountain Midwife; and My Old True Love. Prodigal Summer gives a picture of the wonderful and sometimes complicated life of the mountain people. This book educated me on nature, survival, and how the cycle of life affects plants, animals, and all living creatures. It was an easy and enjoyable read."
3,"Still love ""The Bean Trees"" the best",Good book but as with Poisonwood Bible I felt that I was kind of left out there.....would have enjoyed more closure at the end.
2,disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Poisonwood Bible,"" however I found this book disappointingly formulaic. Similar to another reviewer, I predicted all the outcomes of the book because they were so blatantly obvious. Characters, events, and dialog were far too precious. It's always nice to learn something new but the presentation of ecological lessons and our place on the earth in this novel was so preachy that I wanted to throw the book in the dustbin. All in all, it's a decent read but anyone expecting a book as good as any of her earlier ones will be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"After devouring Poisonwood Bible, I was so excited to see this new novel appear. It was a great disappointment. It is very disjointed, not affording full character development. I did learn quite a bit about insects, but that was not my purpose in purchasing this book."
3,A good effort!,"This book was generally well done but I did struggle at times with some of the storyline. I felt it wasn't up to the same par as ""Going Too Far"" , by the up and coming Steven Gardner, but it was a worthy effort!"
2,Not up to Kingsolver's usual standards,"Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite authors, but this book is proof that even the most talented author can write a mediocre book once in a while. If you are new to Kingsolver, read another one of her books first. This one is not her best effort."
5,There are no words,"There's no reason to analyze this book. I can just say, simply, this book is exquisite. Read it."
2,Prodigal Summer,"I enjoyed the beginning, which is well written and draws you in. At about a quarter of the way though Kingsolver starts showing her bias. Excuse me if you are a fan of hers, I knew nothing of her work when I started, but what was written on the cover. At about a third of the way through I quit the book deciding I owed it no more time and was no longer enjoying myself.Kingsolver's bias were women, environmentalists, nonsmokers, nonchristian, organic farming and other similar causes joining what we would have in her idealistic world. The problem was the complete lack of sympathy for opposing views left a very unrealistic book."
4,A book to be read outdoors,"In ""Prodigal Summer"" Barbara Kingsolver gives us three very readable storylines that tangentially intersect. As a analytic reader, I immediately went about trying to figure out the connections between the characters and storylines.About a third of the way through the book, I spent a few hours outside reading on a nice day. That when it hit me that the power of this book isn't in the characters or the storylines, it is in the storytelling. I found myself more absorbed by the natural world around me. Suddenly I wanted to know the names of trees, and flowers, and even insects (thanks to Lusa).At the end, the storylines all wind up about step before where I saw them finishing, but that might just be a matter of taste. Some folks might like a little mystery and imagination to play a part in the ending of a good book."
4,Bland,"Barbara Kingsolver is a talented author with a niche for narrative. Her words are beautifully put together and her characters area alive with emotions and feelings. I'm amazed by the amount of time and energy she put into researching for this novel. However, finishing the novel left me with a feeling of dissatisfication. I didn't like the ending. It left too many things unsettled and did not seem to relate to the rest of the novel. In fact, finishing the novel made me think, what is she trying to get at? Because that's how I feel. What did she want me to get out of the novel. What's her point? However, the novel is a good one and the narrative is outstanding. The plot is a bit shaky and perhaps it is because she introduced too many characters into it."
4,One of my favorites...but something missing,Have you ever read a wonderful book and then been disappointed with the ending? I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's books and LOVED every one. This one was was no exception...but how I wish the ending weren't left so unresolved! Is there a sequel? You could probably guess the things that are left unsaid but it's still disappointing when a book suddenly ends with what seems like the last 5 pages missing.
3,Not Kingsolver's Best,"""Prodigal Summer"" has a lot of the qualities that make Kingsolver's books fun to read - strong female characters, witty dialogue, beautiful prose. But in this book Barbara got on her high horse and stayed on it - we got the ecological message of this novel again and again and again, given voice by all three main characters. Characters started blending together and one in particular became little more than the mouthpiece for the naturalist theme of the book. Kingsolver used a lighter touch in her other books (although the last third of ""The Poisenwood Bible"" gives ""Prodigal Summer"" a run for its money in the preaching department) and if you haven't read a Kingsolver book yet, this isn't the one to start with. Read ""Animal Dreams"" instead."
2,Am I crazy? I just don&#65533;t get it.,"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's books and her best have changed my life. She makes it look easy. Unfortunately, this book grated on my nerves like a sermon that wouldn't quit. I didn't like any of the characters, except maybe Lusa Landowski. All of them were basically two-dimensional megaphones for the message of saving the environment. I believe wholeheartedly about saving the environment, but every page seemed like an onslaught of lecturing. In between the lectures, the characters were minutely developed, and the storylines seemed to hanging together by a thread. The title of this book should have been Preaching to the Converted. For a great and moving story, with political undertones, read Kingsolver's Animal Dreams. She can do better."
5,Kingsolver has a new book out! Hooray!,"Whenever I hear that Kingsolver has a new book out, there is no hesitation to get it. She absolutely delivers, whatever the subject. And when I read Prodigal Summer, I was not disappointed. But then, have I ever been? This is a very special book, one that you want to read slowly and carefully. And come back to again and again. The three stories are clearly separate yet they intertwine - I' m hoping we'll hear from Deanna and Lusa and the Old Chestnuts in future stories. I get the feeling they're all poised for new adventures. When I read Poisonwood Bible, I remember thinking there were a few parts that could have been cut, that it was too lengthy. But with Prodigal Summer, I just did not want the book to end!"
2,"One good story, plus filler","I looked forward to this book, but just this morning turned the last page and set it down diappointed. The story of the mourning widow and her return to life, along with the farm that is her disputed inheritance, had real pull. I wish she had concentrated on this heart-told story. The rest of the stories seemed like filler. A lot of the book seemed to be pandering to middle-aged women's fantasies--burgeoning young men bedding women who thought they were done with sex. The ""messages"" about pesticides, the complexity of the natural environment, etc. were hammered in relentlessly. I enjoyed the Poinsonwood Bible--thought it an incredible evocation of the place and characters. This book doesn't measure up to her previous level of achievement."
4,Too Preachy,"Since ""Poisonwood"" was the only book by Kingsolver that I had read, was really looking forward to this one. Very disappointing, however. I felt like a 4 year old being given a lesson on ecology. The characters in the book were wonderfully drawn and I was very interested in the complexities of their lives, but the lecture on almost every page about conservation was a little annoying. A little goes a long way, especially if your audience is already pretty well versed in the subject."
2,"Ok, I get it. Every day is earth day.","I love Kingsolver's writing, and I do believe that every writer should be passionate about their message, but this one just sent me over the top. I felt like I was in Sunday School for litterbugs -- the ongoing lectures about nature and conservation and biology lessons -- enough already! Not to mention I could not relate to any of the characters, least of all Deanna with her love of Coyotes and her hatred of humans. I kept reading and waiting for it to get better. I'm not sure it did.I try to remember that every novel cannot be stunning. Even the best among us writes a mediocre piece from time to time. This one is definitely forgivable coming from such a talented writer as Kingsolver, but I do not recommend it."
3,"beware, make sure you have the correct software.","I bought the wrong package and amazon would not accept it for exchange after my purchase (i ripped it open thinking it was the perfect solution, my bad). Make absolutely certain you are purchasing the right item. Sure wish Adobe woulda kept hands off, MacroMedia cared more."
1,not what I expected,I did not realize it was written by a gay man about his gay expieriences. I'm not into that at all!
1,Basic Thoughts,The book seemed to me to be almost condescending and patronizing adding little to no significant information that would effectively aid anyone who might somehow find Him or Herself in a D/s relationship nor does it offer any assistance for those who might be confronted with a partner whom may wish to experience a D/s dynamic. Much more could have and should have been done with this book. Hardly worth the time to either write it or read it and hardly worth the effort to write it or read it and not worth the purchase price.
2,"Good primer, little else","I think this book is good for someone S/M curious, but afraid to make the first step towards the lifestyle. It gives you a general feel for the philosophy behind S/M and D/s, and makes you feel that you are ok and safe if you want to explore these types of feelings. I found it a little too Pollyanna and politically correct for my taste, which is why I would recommend it to beginners only. It is true that it is geared towards gay leather crowds, but it is imformative for that reason if you know little about the gay Top/bottom lifestyle."
1,This guy doesn't have a clue,"If you are looking for information or pleasure reading on the subject of BDSM, don't go anywhere near this author. The 'author', jack rinella, seems to have a very limited understanding of BDSM. It appears that he uses these barely literate books of his as some sort of slurred, unintelligible series of pickup lines. There is a distinct void of information in these books, quite likely because this `author' doesn't have a clue about BDSM. He seems to view himself as some sort of player and blathers on incessantly about himself, but never approaches an understanding of the topic of BDSM.This book is horrid. So is his other rambling book of ghastly grammar, misspellings and run-on sentences.. One could hope that he goes back into his little life of obscurity and never bothers us with his inane self-promotional drivel again.I returned them both. Wow, they are THAT staggeringly bad."
2,Not for Everyone,i read this but its not the greatest is stricktly form the Gay Male leather point of view which the descript does not explain good info but very heavy on their personal views
5,It's a Winner!,"Padma Digestin rescued me from the bloating, distension, and general abdominal discomfort that I had experienced every day after taking a popular psyllium supplement (which I needed for my IBS). I was truly astounded that PD releived all my symptoms with the FIRST dosage! I can't recommend it too highly.Barbara DurdenKaneohe, Hawaii"
5,Obangaina taken to the next level!!!,"For those who loved her hit single 'Obangaina', this is a must buy! With traditional as well as original songs sung in several Ugandan languages, this album should appeal to a wide cross-section of Ugandans as well as anyone interested in World music. You will not be dissapointed!!"
1,Banks warranty is terrible,I purchased these in March 2010 and installed them with ease. Now in June 2012 they cracked right next to a weld. I called their customer service to get a replacement and was told because I purchased them on Amazon that they will not cover the defect under warranty. I thought they would be a good product and last a long time but they did not and their customer service is not good at all. I would not recommend someone else wasting over $400 like I have.
5,A jawdropper,"When I first saw this video I was astonished at the easy way it explained how our parents and grandparents exposures to life events and chemicals can change the future of our children. I know that many people blame vaccines on autism disorder. What if it was the grandparents vaccine that caused autism in the grandchildren? How about the incredible increase in peanut allergy. What were these victims grandparents exposed to at critical times. This video is a jawdropper if ever there is one, as to what chemical exposure and world events like famine have done to our grandchildren. God forgive us."
2,Exide Classic 26R-60,"In April 2011 I bought a standby generator for my house and it came with an Exide Classic 26R-60 battery from the generator factory. In May 2012, the battery charge is dropping too low, gives a warning on the generator, and barely can start the engine. I definitely would not recommend this battery."
4,a veces fuego y a veces cieno,"This collection of twenty of Camilo Sesto's hits from the 1970s and 1980s is an excellent introduction to the Spanish-born love balladeer's work. Largely unknown in the English-speaking world, Sesto is a mega-star with a voice well suited to the stage.His lyrics are all about women and the love they inspire, reject, nourish, and protect. Rich orchestrations back up a strong, supple, capable voice. In the Spanish-speaking world now middle-aged people often locate formative experiences in their young lives by pegging them to a Sesto song the was current at the time, much as might happen among English speakers via the music of the Eagles or, say, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. More than one young love will leap to mind when a Sesto ballad arrives unexpectedly over the airwaves.Though the genre is not my favorite, one has to respect Camilo Sesto as a master of it."
2,Camilo Sesto,Dear Amazon is to inform you that just received a CD of Camilo Sesto 15 Grandes Exitos The movie and God Grew Tired of Us and I was charged for 2 CD. Camilo Sesto when only received one. I'd like to solve this problem as soon as possible. Thank you.
4,Rumpole?,"This is the first of two autobiographies by John Mortimer. If you'd like to see where Rumpoles come from, this is how you find out. Amusing in many places, serious in others, possibly a bit more revealing than the author intended."
5,It really flows.,"If you like smooth Jazz, this one's for you. The musicians that came in to make this CD if nothing else should make you want to put it in you music library: Dan Siegal, Ernie Watts, Boney James, Richard Elliot, and Larry Carlton to name a few. If Dan Siegal could have kept it going, they would have given the group Fourplay a solid run for their money, Awesome music."

4,good but not great,"Beginner's Japanese is a very useful beginning text but has some problems. While katakana and hiragana are introduced and used, the text relies on romaji and doesn't introduce any kanji. Using only this text, students can only go so far - you could only improve in speaking and listening, but you would not be able to read or write Japanese very well after using this text."
5,A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words,"Small Blessings is a fun book with a lot of great visuals. Every time I open this book I'm reminded of different memories and aspects of my life. Definitely a feel good book.A couple of my personal favorites:""Sleeping with the window open"" & ""Sharing a treat"""
4,Aviana minimizer bra,"This is an excellent bra,very attractive,that does just what itpromises--minimize!"
2,good idea failed attempt,The idea of a minimizer bra for larger bust size is a great idea but the aviana underwire minimizer was a failed attempt. The underwire is poorly constructed and after wearing it for a couple of hours it was already losing support as if I had had it for years. Since I paid for it I will continue to wear it but not satisfied. I strongly recommend to anyone looking for a good minimizer bra to pass on this one and keep on looking.
3,They're ok grill utensils,"For the price, these are acceptable. After limited use, the stain on the handles began to chip. They are a good size for grilling, and there are many utensils in this set...definitely a plus. But the handles are cheap. I would not buy these again."
1,"Horrible, Horrible quality","Yes, you do get a lot for your buck, but ""you get what you pay for"" proves itself again.The metal and the wood quality is horrible... Metal bends like butter and the wood chirps at anything it touches...Unless you are looking to buy this BBQ set for only one season, add a few extra bucks and buy something more expensive than this.... or get fewer pieces.. I never use half of them anyway."
3,A nice set,"OK, you are not going to fool anyone into thinking you went all out and spent a large sum of money. However, if you have someone who likes to BBQ and you need a reasonably priced gift item then this is a great idea. This is especially true if the person is somewhat ""blue collar"" and won't mind the plastic industrial-looking case.Like most cheap things made in China the metal is of fairly low quality."
4,WORTH CHECKING OUT!,"Although I have another BBQ set, your photo, price, and description have helped me choose to buy this one as a replacement for mine. I like the following points: RUGGED, plastic caring case (a plus in hot Texas weather), hanging hooks (a plus for us uncoordinated types :), and a long-handed wire brush for cleaning (self-explanatory). My only question relates to the size of the grill mitt. My husband, who usually takes food off of the grill, has LARGE hands and requires an oversized mitt. How large is the mitt???? I guess I'll find out when I receive the shipment. From an East Texas customer - Oh yes, P.S. what I've ordered from you so far this year has arrived in both excellent time and in excellent condition :)"
5,What a voice!,Nicola Di Bari is one of the best singers of the those days. I could only hope that more of his songs will be recorded in spanish and become available on DVDs. His work in French or Italian is excellent as well.
3,Disappointed,"I have eaten Reese's Smoked Oysters for years. I am sorry to say that their recent cans have not been as good tasting as they used to be. I started looking at where they are from, and suspect that the source of the oysters may have contributed. In general we have been avoiding eating foods from Thailand, China, and some other Asian countries. With all the problems with items from China in particular, we prefer to eat USA produced foods and buy locally as much as possible"
4,"Great item, at a decent price","Very useful and lightweight, it is an excellent addition to an emergency pack or kit. I recommend carrying this in the backcountry, as well as having the US Army Survival manual on hand. It is very handy for making snares. Just tie one end back on itself with an overhand knot to form a collapsible loop that can trap small game such as squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, or birds. It can be hand-deployed if tied to a thin stick or dowel rod, or it can be remotely set up on saplings or in other creative booby-traps to catch food in an emergency (check legalities before doing this)."
5,Wonderful book to own,"This was very informative on all aspects of art dolls. There is pages informing you about the artist, as well as pictures to look at. i thought this was a wonderful book to own."
5,RIGOR MORTIS WILL EAT YOUR BABIES AND YOUR EARS.,"I'm not going to say too much about this album.It is fast, heavy, hilarious, dark, beer-ridden, and kick ass.This is what speed and thrash are supposed to be.""Foaming at the mouth,"" and ""Re-animator"" are true thrash jems that play out brutifully.Yep, Rigor Mortis will make you use words that only make sense to those who know this album.The remaster really helps this old album out. Now put down your Mickey's Big Mouth and go buy this album. Fierce!"
3,Not too shabby.,"This course definitely has its shortcomings (not enough examples, not enough English translation in the audio), but overall it's a good course. Don't be discouraged by other people who didn't read the pronounciation guide. It's normal Yale pronounciation and it's actually very easy if you spend five minutes looking over the instructions in the book. There is a lot of material here and you'll do well if you have a native speaker to practice with.Update for CD version: The romanization method has been improved and is now the best I've seen. They've also included an English-Cantonese dictionary in the new version. Overall, everything is much, much better. I'd add a fourth star now, but it won't let me."
4,"Works Well, But Not As Pictured","This Traditions Loading Stand works well for loading the cylinder of a Pietta .44 caliber 1858 New Model Army Revolver, but the plunger showing in the product picture appears to be brass and the one shipped is black metal. This is a cosmetic issue and does not effect performance, so it isn't worth the effort for me to return it.The loader is well made, is easy to use, and makes loading an extra cylinder at the range much easier.Recommended, with the caveat that the color of the plunger is black and not brass.CFH"
1,JUNK!,"Mine came with no metal collar on the handle, and handle was unfinished. The black finish was chaulky and rubbed off. The hinge pins fell out, and the plunger was .040 to big to even fit in the cylinders. Don't waist your money."
3,Fun yet not user-friendly for baby!,"This vibrating cow is a fun little toy, yet the nose is really hard to push down. There's no way my 9 month old daughter could do it, I even have a hard time with it! The music and vibrating is also pretty short, so you have to keep pushing it for your little one to enjoy it. It does put a smile on her face, so I give it 3 stars."
3,Entertaining,My daughter has been playing with this toys since she was 3 months she is 6 months now and still enjoys it. It is hard to press though and I have to do it for her.
2,Creepy Cow,"I'm sure this toy is great for some, but it is so loud and obnoxious and really creepy! My 6 month old was not entertained rather she seemed more frightened which made it an easy toy to give away!"
1,Too hard to turn on,"I really like the concept of this toy but it is too hard for even an adult to turn on, let alone a child. Furthermore, once it is on, it only stays on for a couple of seconds and then you are struggling to turn it on for the child again."
2,"When the cow laughs, he is mocking me for making such a horrible purchase.","Cons: Vibration only lasts a few seconds, Difficult to activate (one must press really hard on a specific place on the toy's nose).Pros: Sharp Pointy Ears, and requires one to replace batteries."
2,It has a giggle value at first.,I have twin girls who are 6 months old. Both of them got tired of this toy in 2 minutes. The nose is actually a little too hard for them to push as well. For us it was a waste of money.
2,"Fun for kids, irritating for parents","As others reviewers have mentioned, pushing this toy's ""nose"" button is next to impossible for a child of an age to be entertained by it. Added to its very short play cycle, this can drive a parent to drink - especially if she would rather not listen to the loud, crazy music that close up. My 2 year old got it for his 1st birthday. He's always found it entertaining - and his 5 month old sister also seems to get a kick out of it- but I often keep it hidden to avoid being endlessly prevailed upon to start it up for him."
4,Fun for everyone!,This is so awesome. We bought this for our son when he was a few months old and he still loves it. And we do to! he laughs at it and then we laugh at it.One downside is the nose is hard to press after awhile and when the batteries are almost dead it gets worse.8)
5,great,Great product. works great will order again in the future cant beat the price. brass underbody is the way to go.
2,"Some tracks ok, but nothing of much value for a true Hip-Hop Fan.","I dig a couple tracks on this album but There is only 1 that has a fantastic beat and thats ""My Phone"".The Lyrics are bland and lack any sort of real meaning or texture. He sounds like a kanye wanna-be with his style, and thats nothing to be proud of. Some fun stuff, but overall not a good album."
2,Don't Travel This Road!,"Just as the title of the implies it's a ""long road back"" for Mic Geronimo and the listener. Humdrum beats and wannabe gangster tales plague this cd. To add insult to injury Ja Rule jumps on a track to lend a pity ryhme for an ole friend.Hopefully one day Mic will find the right road. Until then please save you cash."
3,Good concept; poor editing,"This book is full of good information, I'm trying hard to follow it, but it lacks complete information on menus and recipes. Nothing like seeing the menu and then having to go to the index to find the page for the recipes. And sometimes the index doesn't tell you where to find an item. For instance they mention whey all the time; the index doesn't mention it. Time killing and frustrating. Some information leaves unanswered questions. I hope they're selling health and not product. Truly you'll spend a fortune on coconut oil if you don't shop around the internet. I got a great deal on [...]. Again, good information if you don't mind jumping all over the book. If they ever re-edit to a more user-friendly book, they owe us all a copy."
4,Natural Nutrition,"This book was an eye opener for me... I'd always found it difficult to stick to the ""recommended"" eating habits and felt that it was not natural... Surely the fat in milk and eggs is healthy I thought but who am I to go against all the ""experts""... How can anyone get so much protein in during the day? One cannot; hence the need for all the protein supplements...The only problem with this book is the fact that its ""diet"" may not be realistic to follow for many people... I did, however, take the good ideas they have and incorporated them into my own diet..."
3,Maybe I didn't do it right?,"I am hypothyroid and I don't think my meds are right. That being said, I don't know how fair this review is. however, I did follow some recipes and mixed coconut oil into my diet. At first it was great! I lost 10lbs, felt great and etc. But then I noticed how tired I would get when I didn't have a dab of coconut oil. My sister, a RN, said it was because I was ""crashing"". She said, my blood sugar was getting so high off of the coconut oil that when I didn't have it I was just nose diving. I like to eat through out the day to maintain my blood sugar and feel good, but I still get the normal tiredness. I thought at first this was a ""cure"" but then when I saw how bad the crash was, I didn't care to consume coconut oil again.I still use it on my skin and occassionally mix it in my eggs. It does cook well and keep the eggs from sticking."
1,Too Much Oil,"I became very nauseous following this diet. Taking 3 tablespoons daily of coconut oil was just too much. I sure wasn't hungry following this diet! I can't stand the smell of the coconut oil, although I enjoy coconut very much. I thought the science in the book was great and really agreed with the approach. The idea of the oil having anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties was wonderful, but I just couldn't stomach the oil."
2,not good on original kindle,The book is good and I have no complaints about it. however I bought the kindle version and I have the original kindle and I have a hard time looking up recipes on it so I bought the print version it is a shame as I wasted my money. I don't know if the problem was corrected on the newer kindle models but for now I will not be buying cookbooks on kindle. the navigation is impossible
4,Well worth reading,"Very interesting information. However, I got the Kindle version, and would have preferred the book instead. There are no pages or locations for the Index. If a word is in bold letters and highlighted, you can not click on it and go to that word and get more information. Still learning about my Kindle, so it could be my learning curve as well."
3,Hard to Stick With These Meals,"I found that it was hard to do all the cooking that this diet required, because the meals just couldn't be adapted easily for the cooking I do for the rest of my family. I had hoped that it would be simpler, so that I could add a few foods that I wasn't eating myself to the family's meals. There is a lot of good information in this book, and I follow Sally Fallon's eating recommendations in another book of hers, Nourishing Traditions. But I really couldn't use this book."
2,Issues with this book,"I bought the items recommended, and ended up having to not use them. I bought suggested items of non preserved coconut and it was the only thing I could eat. Also bought suggested items of coconut cream and coconut oil. Got really sick from trying to do things the way the author recommended. Would not buy again. Just a waste of time and did not loose any weight."
2,Not interesting enought to hold my interest,"Wouldn't recommend book. Doesn't capture interest. Skipped sections to repetitive with descriptions of ideas. Didn't hold my interest, therefore didn't enjoy the book"
3,"Good concepts, but it is way too redundant.","This book packs a medium amount of information into a pretty tedious reading experience. Although the information is good, everything is repeated over and over again. The book spends too much time talking about cocunut oil and cod liver oil also. Everything pretty much comes back to those two oils--notice the coconut tree on the cover of the book. Also, almost all of the recipes involve coconuts.I was disappointed in this book. The first 50 pages were good, but all the new info stopped after that."
4,Good Information,I liked Nourishing Traditions for a cookbook better than this one but it's a great book to help with a diet.
5,This is the bomb!!!!,"This is a great addition to anyone's library who is interested in health and nutrition. This book in addition to ""NourishingTraditions"" has revolutionized my thoughts on food and food preparation, on what's truly healthy, etc. This way of eating has also revolutionized my body!!!!"
5,Eat Fat Lose Fat,"Everyone should have this book. No nonsense, easy to read, full of recipes. I now understand why my children had learning problems, why I suffered the battle of the bulge most of my life and why I'm feeling great now at seventy. Please don't wait to read this informative book, it has changed my life and helped me to help my grown children eat healthier and strenghthen their immune systems."
4,"Eat Fat, Lose Fat:Lose Weight and Feel Great with the Delicious, Science-based Coconut Diet","The title doesn't give a reader how much more they are going to get from this book, this effects more than just ones weight! A must for readers wanting to learn and understand the importance and value of fat and that all fats are not alike. author does a very good job of explaining this."
4,"EAT FAT, LOSE FAT","I borrowed this book from the library to review before purchasing. Now I'm going to buy it based on the recipes alone.I agree with the comments on the formatting, especially in the recipe section. I would like to see the authors do a companion cookbook.Since I haven't attempted the actual diet plan, I can't say whether or not it actually works (hence, only 4 stars). But the mouth watering foods should make the plan very easy to stick to."
5,What is the rec,"Can someone tell me the recipe for the breakfast and lunch smoothie? I know it calls for whole milk but I have to use coconut milk because I have IBS can not drink milk. I ordered your book now but I want to start the diet now but I have IBS with diarrhea so I have to change some things. The Yogurt Coconut Smoothie I found on the internet.Yield: 1 serving* 1/2 cup fresh or frozen berries* 1 cup plain whole yogurt (or kefir)(or for me ? 1 cup coconut yogurt) NO DAIRY for me upsets my stomach because of IBS* 2 tablespoons maple syrup (optional)(or for me 2 tablespoons of coconut milk) maple syrup upsets my stomach because of IBS)* 2 egg yolks (not for me upsets my stomach because of IBS)* 1 tablespoon melted coconut oilPlace berries in a food processor and process to a puree. Add yogurt or kefir, maple syrup, and egg yolks and process until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the coconut oil.Thank You"
3,A Descendent's Viewpoints,"This is a nifty start to the NC/TN/GA Kilpatrick lineage. There are a few web sites with more details. Its formatting for presenting a family tree makes for easy lineage understanding.The reader needs to consider that this book was current as of June 1975, so many family members may have passed away and/or moved to other localities. Also, as a typewritten manuscript rather than a publisher's release, it has many typos, e.g. Elf or Ella, NC should be Ela, NC, and smudged keystrokes making for difficult legibility."
2,Check Box carefully,"Ordered mine on the web, and it's been dicey since. The box was a bit battered to begin with, and upon trying to assemble the bike, found out that the reflecters were missing, and the front fork was very bent, making assembly impossible. Repeated calls to Hyper (mfg) are met with a 'full voicemail box' message."
4,Highly recommend for any horseperson,"This book provides an excellent introduction to natural horsemanship. It includes step-by-step instructions on how to start a horse, as well as how to solve some of the most common training problems (ie - trailering). All this while focusing on the horse's point of view, and how to develop a 50/50 partnership with your horse. This book is a fairly easy read, and includes several ""case studies""."
2,Disappointed,"Player is uncomfortable, hard to use & battery doesn't stay charged loang at all (2hrs max)"
1,Doesn't Fit Well,I had high hopes for the product but it doesn't fit well around the ears and looks awkward. I wouldn't use them at the gym.
2,Bummin' with Frankie,One word comes to mind when I think of Only the Lonely - DEPRESSING. If you are a casual but enthusiastic Sinatra fan wait until your a true diehard (or suicidal) to get into this one. I'm not there yet. Not an upbeat tune in the set. Nice version of Where or When though....
2,Musically Disappointing,"I was disappointed with the musical quality of the songs. Yes, Frank Sinatra's performance was quite good and the lyrics were poignant. However, I found it hard to connect to the lyrics and the feelings that Sinatra was trying to relate because of the dryness of the music. There have been many sad songs written which were far superior musically to anything here. Examples which come to mind are: Another Day by Paul McCartney, Goodbye to Love by the Carpenters or what I think is the saddest song that I've ever heard - Alone Again, Naturally, by Gilbert O'Sullivan."
5,after so long,I have been listening to FS for a long time and still this is the only album of his I have. Its an extraordinary statement to claim Only The Lonely a perfect piece of art but thats my feeling - judging by other reviews I'm not alone - Ive discarded the last two tracks from my ipod since they are obviously from another plan - and just whats the problem with the art work folks?! If you havent heard the album get it NOW!
5,Probably Sinatra's finest album,"Sinatra's finest recording,unsurpassed by anything else he did. Uncommercial (many of the selections last 4-5 minutes instead of the usual 2-3) but sublime. The Nelson Riddle arrangements are superb. If the American popular song is not high art, this is the album that comes closest to proving that it is."
4,"But, God, this is DARK!","Old Blue Eyes at his best ...but the CD should come with a national Suicide Hotline number enclosed. And I thought ""Wee Small Hours"" was lonesome..."
4,can be a downer,"Make sure you aren't going to slide into sadness if these songs remind you of love lost or mistakes in love, or if you do go there that you can come out of it quickly! As far as the art of it goes, five stars."
5,Memorable,"Had this in vinyl as a teenage--it's still one of the best. As a teen, it suited my 'teen angst', as an adult, it's just plain great singing and orchestration of fabulous songs."
5,Terrific Sinatra,"This CD is simply one of the best Sinatra CD's I have heard. My husband is the true Sinatra fan, but this one I enjoyed more than any other."
3,Just okay,"The individual movie soundtracks are better. The CDs have lots of songs but they are all mixed up. I have listened to them a bit - after coming back from Disney World couldn't get the songs out of my head and was frustrated with not remembering the words ""It's a whole new world, da dat da da dat da...."" Anyway, I plan to buy my favorite movie soundtracks instead."
2,So disappointed.,I wish I had known that a lot of these songs aren't the originals from the movies. I wouldn't have wasted my money.
3,Well...,"These CDs have lots of songs on them; however, I didn't realize when I purchased it that many of them are not the originals from the films. If you don't mind that other people are singing them, this CD is a good buy. If you want the original songs from the films, these CDs are probably not for you."
4,recieved,recieved the cd's in great condition but the case was cracked. i am still enjoying the songs though especially for my wedding coming up.
3,Disney Greatest Hits,"Music is good, but not what I expected. I was hoping for the actual songs from Disney movies, however most of these seem to be covers of songs in Disney movies.Otherwise, CD's arrived in good time and good condition."
4,Very interesting,"This was a very interesting documentary on the making of samuai swords. Particularly the more technical parts concerning the metallurgy and what happens to the molecular structure of the steel and carbon during the forging process. I learned something there that I had not known before. I would recommend this to anyone who has a curiousity about sword-making, particularly the Japanese process."
3,Good Analytical Perspective,"An hour is far too short a time to present an overview of the art and science of the making of samurai swords. Being an episode of Nova, this documentary focuses heavily on the science. It still feels a little like the whole documentary got shortchanged. There are hints here at what could have been included, including the spiritual nature of the sword. Yes, the blades are the most important aspects of these swords and yet it seems that we should have also been shown at least a little about how a sword's furniture is created. Maybe one day we'll get to see two longer format pieces, one about the samurai sword's place in Japanese history and one illustrating the construction of a single katana from start to finish. Until then, we have this well-made, but brief, program."
5,Best trasch can ever,you really will never buy another. this is a lifetime purchase! very sturdy easy to clean and its awesome looking!
3,Can't Return It Without Paying Shipping,"This can says it takes 13 to 16 gallon bags. Well if you put a standard kitchen 13 gallon bag in, it won't fit. I wanted to return it, but I'd have to pay and go through an entire shipping process. Putting bigger bags in it makes it look pretty stupid. I'm keeping it in my garage rather in the pantry where I wanted to keep it for recyclables. I'll have to find another solution."
3,Pretty good...,They wound up working well for me but had to put wood putty on several of them because of dents and dings. Some of them were split where the screws had been put through the rear to join the two pieces together. I realize they're not top grade pieces so it was expected.
3,"Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore","If I had never heard Jennifer Knapp's Kansas, I probably would have liked this one better. But Lay it Down lacks the deeply, intensely confessional nature of Kansas. It also is a bit overproduced at points, with lush strings, etc on several songs. The best tune may in fact be one that Jennifer herself did not write, Shawn Colvin's wonderful ""Diamonds in the Rough."" And, as noted by many others, it is far too short. A very very good CCM album, but disappointing, given what she is capable of."
3,A decent second effort,"To start with, whoever thought this sounds like country/Western hasn't listened to much country/Western. If you have to categorize it, it's folk/pop/rock something or other. I don't like it quite as much as her first album, but this may be one that grows on me kind of slowly. I tend to like her mellower, accoustic songs. As a huge fan of bluegrass, I enjoyed hearing a bit of mandolin in some of the songs. I also disagree with some other reviewers in thinking that this CD is fairly eclectic. It ranges from rockin' to semi-rockin' to mellow. At any rate I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Kansas and I'm hoping to see her in concert in Seattle in April."
3,Not as good...,"I am kinda disappointed! This album does not compare to Kansas, her first album. The best songs are: ""A Little More"", ""I Want To Know You"", ""You Answer Me"", and ""Diamond In the Ruff"". This is a good songwritten album. I think her and Rebecca St. James are the best songwriters. She has talent writing, and I LOVE HER TO DEATH! But, this album is not arranged well at all! All the songs sound the same. And it does not sound like Pop/Rock, it sounds like Country/Western. Jennifer, I LUV U SOOO! But, Kansas blows this album out of the water..."
4,Intriguing,"Just as good as Kansas, but I was a little disappointed at the 38 minute length. This CD plays like it took 15 minutes to listen to. I like the introspective look at a personal relationship with God. The recording quality and lyrical content was excellent as usual."
5,Soulful sound & Honest lyrics,I love this CD. Jennifer Knapp continues to amaze me with her soulful sound and honest lyrics.
4,Jennifer Knapp,"This is such a great CD. Jennifer has such an amazing voice and the lyrics to the song are as of amazing. I was disapointed with Jennifer's new cd"" the Way I am"" but I defnitely advise anyone to purchase this Cd. Some of my favorite songs on here are "" Into You"" "" Usher me Down"" and "" A little More""Make sure you hear Jennifer's duet with Max Powell, lead singer of third day and their song "" Aleluia"" on the City of the Hill Cd"
3,"""Final"" Yamato","This 2-CD set contains music from the 1982 film, Final Yamato. This film was intended to be the closing chapter of the Space Battleship Yamato saga (and until late 2009, when Yamato Rebirth debuted, it was).Prior to this release, there have been several albums featuring music from Final Yamato. The music is pleasant, but very little of the original Yamato themes can be found therein. For this reason, these albums have never been held in as much esteem as those featuring the older, classic melodies."
2,Not worth the read..,"I bought this hoping to gain a new perspective and what I got was an author who spent too much time talking about herself and her experiences which didn't relate to me at all as a male from the Eastern US. The book also seems to use date references and comparisons that don't ring true for me. It's not a bad book, but not what I expected from the reviews. The previews they show of the book are amongst the very best the book has to offer. I would suggest you keep looking...I am."
3,unsuitable job for a women,"This had the beginnings of a great series, however I found it dull and boring. Very slow paced, far too much time spent on atmosphere which to me underestimated the veiwers ability to grasp the theme."
2,An unsuitable job for an idiot,"I only saw the first one of these. Cordelia Gray does not offer much to refute the idea that being a detective is ""an unsuitable job for a woman."" If I am going to respect a detective, they have to have at least as much common sense and street smarts as I do, which is not setting a high standard, but Cordelia falls utterly short. In addition, I found the pacing much too slow, and I would get fidgety waiting for yet another drawn out scene to move along.I haven't read the book, and I don't think that I will, so I have no idea how faithful to it the show is."
1,Does not work,This extender cable plain does not work in true USB 2.0 mode. It is too slow to be used as an interface to a WinRadio. Really too bad that it does not work as advertised.
4,Very handy,"I got this cable to extend a wireless usb receiver into my bedroom from the computer in my home office. I haven't had any signal problems and it's perfectly flexable enough to get in the right position. It's active, so if you wanted to you could add a second one to make it extend even further."
3,USB cable,This Tripp Lite U026-016 USB cable worked just as good as a NON-powered extension cable. I didn't see any increase of signal compared to a standard USB cable. I could have got a standard cable for quite a bit less.
3,"worked great, except for","This worked great for everything except the scanner part of my Epson RX680 all-in-one printer. When I tried to scan, the computer displayed an error message saying it couldn't properly communicate with the scanner, and the printer display a message saying ""scanning"", and that was as far as things got."
5,Works Great!,I'm using it as a webcam extension. Works great. Seems very sturdy and absolutely no picture quality loss.
5,Works well,This cable is electronically boosted to achieve a distance greater than the USB spec. It takes a few moments for WIN7 to recognize it and then a few more moments to recognize whatever device is plugged in. I'm using it to extend a keyboard through a wall. It has worked perfectly. Recommended.
5,Works great! Exactly what I needed to shoot tethered to LR3,"I'm using this to allow me to shoot tethered in Lightroom 3 on my Macbook Pro with a Canon 60D and/or 1D Mark III. It works great for this purpose. No complaints from me at all. I've had no connection or transfer issues so far, it simply does it's job, and that's nice."
5,"As described, nice cables","Used this to extend my keyboard and mouse cables so I could put the server in another room -- worked like a charm. Seem to be nice quality cables, nothing to complain about. LED light in the female end lights red to show USB power is getting through. Good purchase."
5,"Works, priced right.","It's a USB extension cable, and it works as it should.The price is tough to be, especially as it doesn't appear to have, according to previous reviews, quality problems.I've learned I need a new Momo steering wheel, a G27, to replace my first-gen Momo wheel so it'll work with Dirt 3 and my PS3, but that's fine."
3,Works but...,This works and did what I needed but it can not handle full bandwidth. I used it to extend a webcam across the room for Skype. The video gets a little choppy. I needed two of them for the distance and the web site says you can use two for web cams but it was very choppy. I changed my setup and only used one.It works fine for keyboards and mice.
2,cable failed after a couple years,"hang onto your receipt to get it exchanged during its ""lifetime warranty"".mine failed after about 2 years - and no receipt..."
2,The Tripp Lite only works at USB 1.0 standard,"I wanted to use the Tripp Lite active extenion cable to move my Linksys USB wireless adapter to a differnt location in the room. First I used a standard usb 16ft cable I had download speed of 18-54Mbytes. Then I added the Tripp Lite active extenion cable, I only got 1Mbytes/sec transfer rate, which is USB 1.0 standard and not the USB 2.0 standard"
1,Does not work,My original purchase of this cord was disappointing because it didn't work. I returned it and a replacement was sent that didn't work either.Don't buy it.
4,active usb cable,Works great. I use it to connect from my netbook to my usb port on my sound system. I have all my music on my netbook and I love being able to sit in my recliner and punch up tunes.
2,**Money Saving Review Here (for the money conscious)**,"You can get two 15ft USB extender cables on amazon for less than $10.00 right here 15 Foot USB 2.0 Extension Cable Free Shipping. Your Welcome.Although I do understand that some people like to waste a few dollars every now and then. The reason why I gave it the second ""star"" is because this is a good cable overall - if money is no object."
5,The one you need for tethered shooting with your DSLR,"After trying several others that did not work, this is the first USB extension cable I've found that allows an extension of tethered shooting abilities for my Nikon D300. The extra 16' is exactly what I needed and it works the same as if just the manufacturer-supplied cable was the only one plugged in."
3,Gene alive,pretty good live document of this powerful english rock band. all the songs sound good and there aren't really many surprises. solid.
3,Kindle edition omits all illustrations,The Kindle edition does not include any illustrations or charts. Some of these omitted pictures are not missed but some are important to see positions and movements and they are referred to in the text. This good book is not so good on the Kindle.
1,Kindle edition has no illustrations,"I bought this book on Kindle based on all the starred reviews, but the Kindle edition has no illustrations. This is deceptive, and I should have been informed before purchase. It's not the same book without illustrations."
5,Performing Arts Reference Must,"Though the book is sub-titled A Dancer's Guide..., I consider it a must reference book for one who attends live ballet or views it on television. It explains in detail the exquisite nature of the art with outstanding pictures. For the dilettante who wants to understand how demanding a craft ballet is, this book is the answer. It covers everything significant about ballet's history, its people and its traditions.Eliza herself has rendered an extraorodianary performance and made a significant contribution to the art of ballet."
4,Vague,Ms. Minden is a great dancer and professional ballet shoes designer. But this book is quite vague and lacks specific discussion concerning dancing.
5,yeah,"this book is amazing. i recommend everybody who enjoys the art of ballet to buy this book, it is truly amazing and it will help you to even select a school for ballet"
5,One of the best westerns ever written.,"This is one of the best westerns that I have ever read. The characters come alive and this author definitely is a studious expert in knowing human nature.Trey and Sarah McLean are wonderful characters, as well as all of the others who are in this story.Elmer Kelton fleshes them all out and there are no real minor characters. That, I believe, is where a lot of his true talent lies."
4,"Read Alexanders ""Notes on synthesis and form"" first","This book will overwhelm the uninitiated reader with its sheer volume of information and organization. Getting the most from this book requires understanding its underpinnings -- else it is a giant list of stuff.Those underpinnings are in Alexander's book ""Notes on Synthesis and Form"" Unfortunately from an Amazon perspective the Author's middle initial is in that citation, so it does not show up here. Christopher W. Alexander's Notes on Synthesis and form makes all of the follow-on books understandable and more useful to you.The additional time and money for this work are well worth it."
3,Too philosophical for a non-architect,"A colleague recommended this book to me. I am a software developer and he said that this would be a good book for me to read to better understand the concepts that are shared in this book.I haven't finished it yet. I've been working on getting through the book for the past 2 months. I continue to pick it up and read a chapter or two and then put it down again.It is so theoretical that I'm struggling with the concepts as they relate to what I'm doing.Perhaps my opinion will change later on after I have finished the book, because I know a lot of people think very highly of this author, but for now, I'm not getting how it relates to what I do."
2,"Philosophical, but probably impractical","Got this book by reference of another book recommendation, but it does not seem to be that great. I find it rather too philosophical and very boring actually. Perhaps someday I will read it again and find the true inner meaning of the book."
5,the timeless way of building,"I have previously read""a pattern language"" by the same author, and he calls "" the timeless way"" his 1st volume in the series. I can see why. I like them both equally well. They are a very liberating perspective on self-design and construction."
5,One of the best books for design,This is a wonderful book. I am a software engineer and had got this book to orient myself for software design and I found this great.
2,Dog Repellent,I had researched for the best product to use on areas inside and outside to keep my now 5 month old Golden Retriever from chewing on everything and bought this product. Either my dog is one of those who this doesn't affect or the product doesn't work. It made him more aggressive on the items I sprayed. I would be reluctant to recommend and should I tried a sample first instead of buying a gallon.
3,Long Long Hair,"I've got long long hair. I needed a good brush to flatten it out without letting the ends flip up and out. I wanted boars hair and this one has it. However, I don't like the handle; it was to thin and especially so right where you hold it with your fingers. That and the smooth handle didn't offer a good grip. It gave me hand cramps when blowing out my hair. I splurged and bought the Ibiza because of the handle. First thing I noticed when I looked at it was that the Ibiza has twice the bristles of this one. I pulled the Ibiza through my hair and it was incredible. Don't buy this one... spend the extra money and get the Ibiza. You won't regret it... the only thing I regret is not buying the Ibiza first."
1,Very disappointed,This add misrepresents the product. It looks as if you are buying a collection of 3 brushs and only one arrived. Note the range pricing without any ability to select the actual brush you will be shipped. This is an improvement over when I ordered as it used to only have one price so I was very surprised to only receive one brush. The vendor never replied to two emails that I sent two weeks ago.
2,Nothing special,"Not a great brush - there is nothing great about this brush. I don't even bother with it, get a ceramic one instead!"
3,great to have a re-issue...but nothing to make it special!,"the Caroline label did such a bang up job on some of the Human League reissues, so it's a HUGE disappointment to see this no frills reissue of Sigue Sigue Sputnik. HOW could they NOT include the 12"" version of the song Success, the marriage of sigue sigue with the SAW production team behind all the Dead or Alive hits? Plus there was the great B-side Frankenstein Cha Cha to that 12"" single that should have been included as well. What a missed opportunity."
5,worked as hoped,Used it to put new nose pads on my sunglasses as was recommended by the manufacturer. So far so good.
2,Dont Bother Unless you see it in a Bargain Bucket,"This is seriously lazy stuff, and does no justice to Testaments live attack. To start with, the sound quality is the sort of standard you get when you see a recording of the school talent show with a 200 year old camcorder and the show is using the worst P.A. ever. Only 100 times louder. If you don't know the songs well already from other releases, then they just wont sound like anything on this DVD.The plus side however is that you get to watch some of their fantasticly dodgy music videos and and some minorly funny on the road footage. For die-hards only!!!"
5,quality comes at high price,quality food but the price is very high. luv amazon's free ship over $25.
5,Re-discovered a favorite fragrance,"I was delighted to be able to buy this fragrance since I have not been able to find it for years. It is one of my favorites, and I like it just as much as I always did. A word of caution--use it sparingly--a little goes a long way!Eldeberry"
4,Ex Libris,This book echoed my feelings about reading.I read widely and am always reading several books at the same time.
5,Presumption and a Perfect Set,It is I who feel presumptuous in attempting to comment on such a delightful collection of essays. Indubitably they constitute a Perfect Set. The first one serves to assuage one's insomnia and return the reader to a deep and rewarding sleep strewn with the diamonds Fadiman has cast across the path. The next adds interest and occasion to a too long international flight. The third shortens a bus ride made over long by the inevitable congestion of traffic. Each essay stands alone as a perfect piece of prose and together they make a beautiful collection to open the reader's mind to the manifold nuances of literature.
2,Phew!,"Thank goodness for the other 2-star reviews (3 at this point) since I don't feel such a heel giving Ex Libris (or rather, and especially, its author) such a hard time over on Amazon.co.uk. But she kind of invites it. Another reviewer says She gave me a new appreciation for polar expeditions. My sentiments exactly!! Anyway, thanks, guys, for fleshing out my feelings."
2,A journalist in disguise,"No, bloody no! I should have known better. U.S. bestsellers do not normally appeal to me, and this was no exception, despite its seemingly tempting subject. Ms. Fadiman's love of books may be ever so sincere, but she reads (and thinks, and quotes, and writes..) in a horridly superficial manner. Fadiman is no ""essayist"", she is a journalist in disguise, and to her, literature seems to be no more than the subject of a nice dinner table conversation, a pleasant tickling of the senses, an endless source of witty quotations. It seems she's read it all, but hasn't understood anything (kind of a journalists' occupational disease..). Add a huge dose of self-satisfaction (including self-satisfied self-irony) and tiring babble about her gorgeous family, and what do you get? Something so CUTE it makes you want to throw up. If you like books (I said ""books"", not ""literature""), but prefer the movies or Life magazine, this might be something for you. For me, this is just too U.S.American!"
2,"""WE ARE NOT ALONE"" (but ""THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE"")","I agree with the comments of ""Am I alone?"". And you are not, though it's scary to think what the Fadimans might become if ever we were to contact aliens & have strange dictionaries dropped in our laps..... I was a classmate of Anne's in her golden childhood, and she was just that kind of paradox: someone easier to love than to like, at times. Coming from a huge manse in Bel Air roughly the size of Windsor (hence, ""My Ancestral Castles"") she may have fallen early on for the ""sizzle"" more than the steak. Obviously, there's hope: her other book ""The Spirit Catches You..."" has a lot of good stuff in the pages, and she always was very clever. Very often too clever for her own good. My good wish for her, as ever, is that she forget about all that has been handed down to her from literary High Places, and consider what she's been given from Above. (Amen.)"
5,My Name is Alyson and I am a Biblioholic!,"If you ever have doubts that you are a biblioholic, read Anne Faidman's EX LIBRIS, and remove all doubt. This book is the most wonderful collection of essays on books, words and book-obsession. After reading EX LIBRIS, I had a strong desire to be adopted by the Fadiman family. Oh, to live in that family of readers, trade really long words over the breakfast table, and write in the margins of all my favorite books! It is so nice to know that I am not alone in my obsession. Ms. Fadiman speaks for us all!"
5,Works Great,Very easy to install and stopped my car like they were supposed to. No excessive wear apparent after using them for over 6 months... seems like a winner!
4,An honest and fascinating history,"This book starts as a sketch of a family history, and each succesive chapter adds a little more detail and depth to the picture. Some chapters give only highlights, while others enrich the colors or fill in some disturbing shadows. By the end of the book I felt a deep sympathy and affection for the writers and I was awed by their courage, mutual affection, forgiveness, and honesty. You will find some episodes of an idyllic small-town childhood but also some pain, disillusionment, and confusion, but no cynicism, grudges, or self-pity. Each of the three daughters saw their parents differently, and their roles in the family dynamic were sharply contrasting. I couldn't put it down."
1,Very sloppy DVD,This DVD is useless. There are much much better instruction DVDs on how to approach the Old Masters technique although none of them can match a good workshop.
5,Aggie,"What a delightful movie. A must have. It depicts the everyday life of the French. You are drawn into their lives by the wonderful story, the superb acting and mis-en scene and of course, the fact that it is in black and white only adds to the emphasis of the whole atmosphere of the movie."
3,"Good, but limited in breadth - get the Guide to Birds of NA instead","Peter, I love that you rated your own product! Anyways, this CD-Rom is good, but I would invest the extra money and get the Guide to Birds of North America instead, so you have access to all the birds of NA and not just one region. I have written a more extensive review for that product. As I wrote there, the two issues I have with this software is (1) the audio is short and does not include calls or song variations for many birds and, to a much lesser degree, (2) some species could use more photos. Having said that, I'm really glad I have the complete guide after having used the regional one to learn my birds before field research (I recommend Stokes CDs for audio though). The quizz option is great. Also, the complete guide includes the Birder's Handbook, whereas the regional guide does not."
4,Great life jacket,Excellent life vest. Keeps Babies head out of the water. A bit bulky for water play though
3,Does its job but...,"I love how I have no worries that my child isn't going to be going under with this. His head will be kept from bobbing forward for him to breathe in air and it fits nicely around his body though he had a problem with his arms touching so he couldn't hold anything. I also like the handle for easy yanking out of the water. HOWEVER, the problem that I have with it is that his head is ALWAYS facing up... into the sun. Even with a hat on, he's squinting and his face and eyes are being exposed. It's also a bit bulky to hold him in it but it's better bulky than unsafe. Because of how they always face up, I stopped using it with my older child long before I needed to and switched to a different life vest."
5,great!,Our child is only 1 and 20lbs so it is bulky but definitely puts her on her back with her head out of the water any time she is let go of. I think next summer she will be able to control herself more but I love how safe it is for now incase she ever slips or falls.
3,Seems like a good vest...,"The vest seems sturdy and I feel safe with my daughter in it. She wears it when in a boat. It does not fit her comfortably, although I am guessing most life jackets wouldn't fit babies well since they are little and vests are bulky. Her arms cannot come together while in it. The top squeezes and pushes on her neck. she is 20#/29inches. I have to hold her in a reclined position when she wears it because she isn't able to sit comfortably even in a baby seat since it is bulky."
2,Riotgrrl Manifesto,"I consider myself very liberal and am a fan of Cho. However, this book just wasn't polished enough. The topics - while all worthwhile - were dealt with in such a way that you just wondered if she was hurting the causes she feels strongly about.As an example, her very public friendship with Damien Echols. The segment on this topic seemed contrived when she also then spoke of knowing and having friends who are criminals. I just don't think the feelings were well expressed.This book is just one massive journal of rants that she has published. If she wants uprising from the people - I hope its better rehersed than this. I was looking for wit and biting insite. I walked away with neither."
2,She's much better at standup,"She's wonderful as a standup, but in this book, it's just doesn't work. The 'anger' that works so well on stage is somehow a complete turn off in this book. And for all her railing against Whites whites whites and especially white males, painting huge and nasty stereotypical portraits of them, one comes away wondering-- hey, Margaret, who exactly is the racist here?"
1,Condescending and Boring,"I agree with so many other posters- Cho's comedy and anger works in 30-minute chunks on Comedy Central, but in a book it's a real turn-off. I'm a politically liberal, adult white female and I didn't feel ""oppressed"" enough to be part of Cho's audience, and her ""call to fight"" felt contrived and redundant. She neglects to figure that people reading her book would tend to be sympathetic with her views - most of them- and rants and rails as though she must convince the reader thata) she is right andb) white men are two-legged demons.Don't waste your time. For the same effect you could stand in a quiet room for five minutes, fuming, listing every racial slur you can think of before finishing with ""... stand up and fight!"" and you'd get the same result."
3,nice when it worked...,"I have this along with other pink kitchen aid items. I did not use it regularly and went to use it and it would not turn on. I left it in the cabinet and was going through items and thought to try it before throwing out. Well, it worked. So I moved it to my counter top in rearranging and went to use it and now it doesn't work. The same thing happened to my handhold pink mixer. I will not buy another kitchen aid appliance."
2,Poor Quality,I love the color but that is about it. The product has proven to have a fragile system. I use it on average once a week to puree/chop 1 small onion and garlic. It works fine for about 6 weeks and I don't know what happens but the motor stops working. I have had the appliance replaced twice and the same thing happens. I have had my Cuisinart for years and never had a problem.
1,An affront to Chritians and Jews,"This book has a banal bias against Christians, the Jewish people and the State of Israel. It is filled with factual errors regarding Christianity and Judaism. It is propaganda disguised as a benign introduction to the Muslim faith."
1,Horrible Book,"If you really want to learn Spanish this is not the book for you. This book is boring and unhelpful. I found my students to be frustrated and annoyed with this book. They did not feel it was a good resource. I found it annoying myself and it does not provide good activities for a college or high school level. In my opinion, the activies are a bit hokey."
1,"Bad, out-of-dated edition","I bought this book recently, when it reached my door. I found it was out-of-dated (the 3rd edition, instead of fourth or the lastest 5th edition) and there was no CD attached as it is said in the introduction."
1,This book sucks,"First off, if you are being forced to learn a second language for a math degree, then you would already be put out. But to have use this crappy book with crappy exercises is just too much. I used this book through 103 (becuase I HAD to) and I still can't speak Spanish. I get good grades (even in this class) but only because testing is done before memory lapses. I suspect by fall quarter I won't remember 1/10 of this [...].I feel the problem lies in forcing students to take languages they either don't or won't need in the future, and then only offering an introduction. What a waste of time and money. And you school administrators have Phd.'s? If your only asset is teaching language, then go teach at a language school; keep out of out of the mainstream eduaction system so the rest of us can learn. And if you just HAVE to force foreign languages on us, can you at least use books that take into consideration we will never use the language? Something like Dick and Jane for Spanish?"
4,Best pocket reference ever,This is one of the best pocket reference book that I have bought so far. Plenty of information on how to read digital electrical meters and their meaning. (main reason for purchasing this book). Lots of diagram that shows in detail about high and low voltage outlets and prongs. I only wish that the letters were a little bigger. My eyesight is not so good.
1,"Outdated, small, unclear drawings","About half this book is ""This is a drill. This is a drill bit. This is a screwdriver""A quarter is charts and tables you will never use or be able to match equipment to. I'm an industrial electrician apprentice, and I doubt I'll ever use these pages, which were meant for people in my specialty.The drawings are pre-1989 era (the date on this book), and therefore have old pre-CAD drawings...you can't tell what is a wire and what is pointing to a wire, so you have no idea what is labeled what...is that a blue wire? Is that a pointer? Why are two wires labeled with different colors? All line drawings, and few things that are educational.Why does a REFERENCE book tell me what a screwdriver is? Who doesnt know that? Theres also many things lacking, such as modern Lock Out Tag Out procedures.I'm glad I only paid a few dollars for this book; if I had paid even half the cover price, I would have been sick.By far the most useless book in my employment library."
3,American U.,"This book indicates that American Universities admithundreds of thousands of ""students"" who should not beallowed within a mile of a university campus. Also the book,whichis written by a Professor of English and History,contains a large number of errors in grammar and wordusage."
1,Major disappointment.,"I found this book a complete waste of my time. There are all types of college students. Did this guy spend any time doing research? His conclusions are suspect, at best."
4,Eye Opening,"As an Englishman living in the United States, I can never get enthusiastic about college sports. I have no alleigance to a US college, so why bother? This book is an eye opener and no mistake. The author says, if your are not in the ""Honors Program"", then by and large you are going to receive a pretty mediocre undergraduate education if your University is a big time NCAA school. Students don't get a good education, but the university needs their tuition dollars, so it distracts them with the ""Beer and Circus"" mentality of big time sports. Not only is this a shame, it is a disgrace. He backs up his arguments too with many quotes and references. I was particularly interested in the role he gives to ESPN in this."
2,Rocky Goes to Russia,"Rather than call it quits after ""Rocky III,"" Sylvester Stallone brings the Italian Stallion into the Reagan era with this sloppy yet fast-paced sequel. ""Rocky IV"" is pure comic-book hokum that jettisons any semblance of realism, especially when the Grand Tetons stand in for Siberia. Unlike the previous installments, Stallone shows astonishing laziness in his direction and writing (the thin screenplay fits on the back of a postcard). However, Sly delivers the goods with a great training montage - far more exciting than the cartoonish showdown between Rocky and Ivan Drago (stoically played by Dolph Lundgren). Be prepared to laugh when Gorbachev applauds Rocky's ridiculous final speech."
3,2 and a Half Stars,"After getting the title back in the third entry in the series, a Russian named Ivan Drago emerges as a top draw in the amateur ranks and even draws the attention of Apollo Creed. The arrogant, whimpy Creed stuipdly offers a challenge to the massive Drago in an exhibition match and gets it handed to him, as some fatal blows land Creed dead as Rocky refuses to throw in the towel. Seeking revenge, Rocky now faces Drago himself and predictably goes 15 pounds again. The thing holding this back that it is yet another supbar cash in on the Oscar winning power of the first, simply one of the best films ever made. Another heart warming story but we've seen it all before. As entertainment it would get four or five stars it just is too much of a cash in despite some great acting by Stallone and Dalph Lungren in his role as Drago. Sequels are always a cash in and by this time not as many people fell for Stallone's good acting. It's just too predictable as Rocky was becoming generic."
3,"Entertaining, but lacks credibility.","The makers of this movie could have at least researched Russian names, before making this. Drago is nowhere near anything remotely Russian. Apparently the only Russian name that came to their minds is Ivan, how original.While this movie is entertaining, it is a cleverly made anti Soviet propaganda that was expected of the time, with little shred of truth to it."
4,A question of honor and something else!,"Rocky IV meant (as no other sequel a symbol of power in the huge geopolitical staggering U.S.S.R. The metaphor is so obvious that hardly may be better described. This time Rocky has to make an act of justice when his friend Apollo Creed dies in combat against Ivan Drago, the new Soviet techno machine, a sort of Caucasian Terminator; Apollo was in fact his past rival in Rocky II, helped professional and spiritually to win that infernal combat in the third sequel.In this opportunity the chances are against him, Drago is a merciless and menacing fighter, who embodies the spirit of a nation, historically adverse to the Western hemisphere.Sylvester Stallone didn't waste this historical opportunity to carve in relief two different ways of thinking, living and fighting."
1,The worst movie in the history of celluloid.,Seriously. Worse than can even be imagined.Worse than I or any one else could ever describe. The veritable definition of movie-star egomania. Awful beyond all comprehension. Just...awful.
3,Rocky & The Cold War,"I remember seeing this on the big screen in its premier when I was 16, and that was the good ol cold war era when the Russians were the bad guys. I remember I enjoyed seeing our hero beat the tar out of this huge mindless Soviet machine!It was a very patriotic and Xenophobic film that aroused U.S. nationalism in audiences here. Now, the film seems dated as the world situation as changed(If Rocky IV were made now, maybe the Rock would go 15 against an Iraqi backed by the Hamass!), and it is a good piece of film nostalgia. The movie plays much like ROCKY III with a reliance on a lot of MTVesque sequences that are nothing more than music videos(for example, after Apollo's funeral Rocky climbs into sportscar and speeds away into the night as we are treated to a montage of flashbacks from earlier films while rock music blares on the soundtrack). It is another example of how pop & bubble gum the films got, but ROCKY IV is still good entertainment!"
3,Rocky IV - Russian Roulette,"Rocky IV isn't a terrible movie but it isn't that great either. Some bad plot holes in the script stick out like Paris Hilton's lack of acting ability! I agree with one of the other reviewers whn they said this movie was "" a guilty pleasure"". It sure is. Contrary to others I kinda enjoyed the training montage and fight scenes.Patriotism, Propaganda and Politics are all here in abundance. Because it is woven into the movie so much it appears very dated when viewed nowadays. Still enjoyable but not as much as the other 3 are. Very much a Guilty pleasure, in every sense of the word."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Rocky IV is too ridiculous to get a lower grade but too slight to get a higher one; it will appeal to people who like the franchise but it's dated and really pretty inane and (sacrilege of sacrileges) missing ""Gonna Fly Now."""
5,Rocky rocks!,"After the first few Rockys,I was sure there would be no other one to top it off,but i was wrong.Rocky IV is about retired former champion Apollo Creed going against Russian fighter Ivan Drago when he learns that he may rival him.He dies in the ring,and Rocky feels he must take revenge.He travels to Russia to train against the mammoth fighter and they duke it out in what may be the most ferocious fight in the series.See this movie!Loaded with action-packed training sequences,it's the summer's hottest hit on the shelves."
5,Best Rocky,"In my opinion, this is the best Rocky out of the series. Particularly relevant is the steroid issue. I think it sends the message you can succeed even when others cheat. I think it has a really good plot and was more in line with the Rambo revenge movies than dealing with one's self worth as in Rocky 1 & 3."
4,Rocky with a neat twist!,"I liked this one for the fact that it took Rocky to a different thematic genre. In this one, it's more about 'country vs. country', 'David vs. Goliath' and really drags the 'Cold War Into the Ring'. I liked the unique comparisons of the two training styles of the boxers. Rocky with his 'old-school grit, dirt and sweat' training vs. Drago's 'Lab-controlled, human guinea-pig style, steroid shooting freakish boxer style."
4,Very much worth your time,"What can I say, Stallone does it again. This movie was by far the best out of the five Rockies. It has emotion, tragedy, and perseverence. The fight scenes where magnificent. The training scenes were also very awesome and the music to the film was a good complement."
2,"Nyet, nyet!","The formula was pretty threadbare by the time ""Rocky III"" came around, and this one just beats it into the ground. Trite and contrived all the way, ""Rocky IV"" will TKO the viewer with sheer boredom. Its only saving grace is that it's not as bad as ""Rocky V"", but that's not saying much."
3,okay but the jacket cover was torn,"The disc played fine but the jacket cover was torn. I guess I'm being sort of anal, but if something doesn't look good which is what it was listed as, at least write it in the description. This is why I give it three stars."
1,The Conservative Rocky,during the Reagan Era it was Russia this and Russia that.so the COnservative Sylvester Stallone plays that up here in this film.and the results are very Predictable.skip it.
3,Good nonthinking fun,"While this might be the worst Rocky movie in terms of plot and, well, deep feeling, this is also one of the most fun Rocky movies to sit down and watch with friends. This movie definitely has the best training sequence of any of the movies. It's amazing to see just how in shape Stallone was during this movie. The end fight scene puts all the other movies to shame in terms of sheer brutality, but it also is the most unbelievable fight scene as well. Each punch from either man sounds like a sledgehammer on concrete.If you're looking for a good movie to watch and get exited over, pick this one. If you want to watch a really well done, thoughtful movie, pick up Rocky I."
4,Rocky Overcomes His Biggest Challenge Ever,"Probably the second best of the five Rocky's(after the first one). The last fight is an inspiration to me because Rocky is getting smoked by Ivan Drago for the first round and a half. Then suddenly, with one mighty punch, he shows Drago that it is the man with the bigger heart and determination that is a true champion. I like the way Rocky gains the support of the hostile Russian crowd, although that is a bit unreal."
5,"CAN YOU SPELL INSPIRATION...I CAN, R-O-C-K-Y IV!","Simply put, it has the most inspiring training sequence out of all five. The music placed with it is excellent, and the mountain climbing scene put me to happy tears, and raised my pulse about 1000 notches! The fight scene is heartfelt. He wasn't supposed to live through round three. The inspiration felt in this film is outstanding, and if you're a conspiracy buff....well,the Cold War ENDED a short time after. GO ROCKY!"
2,Good Fights . . . But Not Much Else,"Sly challenges Commi Lungdren who killed Apollo in an exehibition bout.Sly seems to have completely given up on plot and just make up a simple set up for Rocky to kick butt, and while that is entertaining it's hardly a movie, more like a scripted boxing match with some soap operaesque, cliched ""Rocky"" melodramatics thrown in to fill the gaps. (Also this one delivers the first of the series' contradictions--part V really loads'em on--but its not like it really matters anyway.)Bottom line: action fans WILL enjoy this, but REAL fans of the series will be highly dissapointed.Trivia: There was a spoof of this titled ""Rocky VI"" in which Rocky is defeated by a midget boxer Igor, made by a Russian director who said he dedicates this to Slyvester Stallone "" Wish I could get my hands on that."
2,"ROCKY FORMULA STILL WORKS, BUT SPOILED BY TOO MANY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS! 2 1/2 STARS!","I own the older box set with the first 5 Rocky films included in it. I wanted to write reviews for the individual films. This review is for the film and the older release DVD.OK, none of the Rocky films are un-watchable, but this forth installment is a little thin. Once the film gets rolling and Rocky steps into the ring it's exciting and fun!the DVD transfer is OK on my edition, but there is room for improvement."
3,I'm just curious...,"It's probably got nothing to do with anything, but with Rocky, Adrian, and Paulie all in Russia, what did they do with Rocky Junior? I know Adrian and Paulie wanted to support The Champ, but Adrian was a mother, too, and their son was a little young to be left behind for months while she was off standing by her man. Leave it to me to wonder about things like that..."
1,Skip volume I - the others are good,"Volume I is painful, but I think Mr. Sarta quickly realized his talent is piano playing, and there was a need to fill--recorded piano accompaniment tracks for small parishes who can't afford a pianist/organist or there isn't one available in their area. My church is in this situation.If you previewed the samples for Volume I, don't judge the rest of the series by it. The other volumes are good!"
5,Great to get started,"This provides a really good historical treatment to the development of economics as we know it today. Skoussen clearly favors the Austrian school, and libertarian style capitalism, but even that's great because our economics schooling in this country is pathetic. This provides a great overall feel for economics and you can work your way into more detailed stuff from here."
2,A shoddy effort by Best Software,"I bought this despite mediocre reviews, because I use ACT! and QuickBooks so much that almost any integration would be better than none. But the reviews are justified -- this is really a half-assed effort by the ACT! makers, probably the work of a single programmer in a week, grossly overpriced, compared to the value one can get from other ACT addons at lower cost (e.g. Address Grabber or Street Wizard). This product adds a QuickBooks tab to ACT! that allows you to access QuickBooks data like payment and invoice history. But this is non-customizable, so most people will only get part of what they'd like. You can also create new vendor or customer records in ACT or QB from data in either application. But the synch feature simply does not work, at least on my PC. I can link existing ACT and QB records, but attempts to update the QB record with new ACT info (address, phone number) does not work. Best Software is shameless in charging so much for this trivial link ($99)."
5,Fun Look at Words,"I bought this book for a fun, short read and a source for unusual words. It fills the bill nicely."
3,sometimes you just want fluff,"This is for reading when you don't want to be taxed by thinking much. There are some sort-of interesting factoids included and I'm not sorry I read the book, but couldn't recommend it - unless you just need to read something that doesn't really matter. I did when I read it, so ..."
1,I'm Aya T 17,"I don't agree with this author. I think he is a realy stereotype. These words which he shows, are not modan any more. There is no person who use them. Even if the person exist, there is few people in Japan."
3,Great Book - Bad Scan for Kindle,"I am thoroughly enjoying this book, but that enjoyment is being spoiled by the very high error rate in the Kindle version.It looks like they scanned the paper book and OCR'd it, but then didn't check it for errors.For a book about language to contain so many misspellings, incorrect words and incomprehensible bits of scan garbage is a real shame.The book itself is a treat - it's just a bit of linguistic frippery, but most enjoyable - Amazon really need to sort out the electronic version though."
4,"Good product, does the job even after six years","Have owned a dozen plus headlamps over a ten year period. And mighty impressed with the quality of this headlamp.It's a bit bulky to be used for anything but hiking, for me. I prefer my Myo XP for climbing at night. I don't do any alpine kind of stuff, so the Xenon lighting isn't really that critical.It is really good product, considering the number of years, I have owned and how it has stood up to time.Finish is pretty ok, but I don't care for it these days. The functionality overrides the looks.At 254 grams, this is a heavy headlamp. Battery case is bulky, but guess nature of all headlamps that use four AA batteries.Another minor quibble is that the light output doesn't seem very clean. The lens creates these minor shadows in the light output. Not a big deal, when outdoors, but while reading, it is more obvious."
5,"Masterfully photographed and written, poetic","Philip Jones Griffiths is among the unsung heroes of our time, photographing the otherwise untold, unsavory aspects of a mean-spirited war completely lacking in human decency. Agent Orange is masterfully conceived, researched, photographed and written in prose that at once is dark, beautiful poetry."
5,best gw album,I bought this on cassette 20yrs ago! I was blown away when I listened to it. Face the day and waiting for love are my favorite tracks. I'm not a big fan of gw.you don't have to be a big fan of gw this is why I highly recommend it
5,"Pure, AMAZING CHO!","This is one of my favorite DVD's. If there was an option to give this ten stars I would. Margaret Cho is the funniest person alive. Yes, she can get down and (very) dirty sometimes....but that is the point. Buy this DVD, get the VHS...or at least rent it from the video store."
4,Makes your cheeks red! (all of them),"This is another very funny comedy concert by Cho, but it is definitely not for the squeemish! A lot raunchier and sex-obsessed than I Am The That One I Want. Blush-inducing to be sure, but wickedly funny. At times you think, ""where can she possibly go next,"" and then she finds a direction and is off and running. Not as moving or personal as the earlier film, but a guaranteed good time for the fans. Everybody should try to see her live, it is a real treat."
5,CHO CHO CHO,"Ms. Cho once again delivers a tape of hysterical and irreverant quality. I rented it locally, laughed by ... off, bought it right here, and have now watched it with numerous friends. You may not like all the subjects she touches on, but you'll love the way she touches upon them."
5,The personal is political,"I can't stop thinking about this film. Margaret brings up so many subjects that are simply not talked about in mainstream media. While I was watching the film I was laughing hysterically. I couldn't help but marvel at her expressions and her incomparable sense of timing. Not until the next day did I start to realize the importance of her, the film, what she has to say, what she stands for. Margaret is the voice for those in this country who question the status quo. And, the animated short that preceeds the film is just plain brilliant."
2,Kind of a let down...,"Well, I love stand-up comedy and am involved in improv myself. I heard about Cho from people who've seen here. My friend and I were especially looking for some stand-up at blockbuster and rented this. We were quite dissapointed. Her jokes are spread very thin (meaning she hits some good punch lines but then draws the joke out till its completely not funny). She uses unneccessary cussing and sex to up her jokes. Being blunt doesn't mean you just say ""vagina"" and ""ass"" all the time. It seemed she lacked flow and her material is rather old and a little too raunchy for shock-value. I tried watching this all the way through 4 times. I paid 4 bucks to rent it so i wanted my money worth. Too bad. Either way, I suggest you try a few comedians like Eddie Izzard, Robin Williams, Ellen Degeneres, Billy Connolly, and others instead. But hey, its just my opinion, everybody's got one."
2,"""No-laughs-for-us C.H.O.""","I'm a Cho fan, and consider ""I'm the One that I Want"" to be just about the best stand-up act ever made... If you like Cho, you definitely HAVE to see that one, her first release. This second one is quite possibly the WORST stand-up act ever made. The lady definitely goes to extremes.Where to begin? The lighting is poor, she looks like she's had a few too many, her jokes are stale reruns, and she's just plain off. I don't know what happened here, but she obviously does not understand the concept of Quality Control.I made a special trip to Atlanta to see this one, being a big fan, and this is one of the ticket purchases that finally made me resolve NEVER AGAIN to buy movie tickets and just wait until things come out on DVD and I can rent them cheaply. Because, most movies are crap!Two stars instead of one because of probably misguided and irrelevant residual gratitude left over from her first stand-up DVD."
2,Way overrated,"I had heard a lot about how funny Margaret Cho was, and finally got a chance to watch her video. I find her way overrated.She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material.However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the ""outlaw"" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not funny."
1,"DID I MISS IT ALL, OR IS SHE JUST NOT FUNNY TO BEGIN WITH?","I had high expectations from this DVD that was given to me as a gift, along with a rave review of a Korean damsel trying to do the black comedy jig. In hindsight, I am glad I didnt shell out for this egregiously uninspired performance, to say the least.Ms. Cho can break all the sexual taboos she wants (quite frankly most of them have already been smashed many times over) but a very, very fundamental tenet they perhaps teach in Stand-up 101 is to have some decent jokes up your sleeve, and ideally, not to pause for an eternity between them. Cliched punchlines followed by drawn out and thus piquing stops make for a painfully tedious viewing.If you have a sense of humor even mildly above average, skip this tripe regardless of whatever minority rave you are exposed to."
4,Very Funny!,"I always thought that Margaret Cho was very funny and in this movie (stand-up comedie) she is great but it got some down momments and a bit boring one but they not too long, just one or two jokes were kind of boring and kind of too much, so you have to be pretty open mind to enjoy most of her jokes.Some very funny parts was when she talked about her drags queens friends, her parents, especially her mother, her problem with food, that when her brother and her were young they were chubby and have to go into a speacial treatement diet, when she talked about her very nice boyfriend who bring her gifts and the best part is around the end, her speach about self-esteem and it is pretty powerful. I think she so right about that. I think you should rent it or buy it especially if you like her you would think she's great!"
4,Entertaining but crass at times,"I found this show very entertaining. I think I would have liked it more, however, with slightly less foul language and fewer graphic references to her sexual encounters. It's not that I get offended, rather it's just not my cup of tea. Fortunately most of it was funny enough that I can easily overlook the gross jokes."
2,Just call me totally out of it,"I really like Margaret Cho, her politics and passion but I wish I had read some reviews before I bought this DVD. Was I surprised!! Call me Ms. Pruddy-Two-Shoes from the mid-west but personally it was too graphic for me. On the plus side I learned about some sexual practices I have never heard of, which as an observer of the human condition, wss pretty interesting (didn't it hurt - or was that the point?). If you are an over 50 woman not into raunchiness and graphic descriptions of alternative sex, be forwarned. For the more adventurous sort, Margaret Cho is still very funny. I would love to hear her discuss non-XXX rated subjects"
1,Annoying and unfunny,I am glad I rented this DVD. It actually is not even worth the rental price. It is that unfunny. I think her impressions are horribly annoying. She sounds bitter and evil rather goofy and funny. I would be surprised if a laugh track wasn't used. The camera never focused once on the audience. So who knows if they were really laughing. I think she is unattractive and that adds insult to injury. She think she is all that and a bowl of soy sauce but she isn't. Her only funny impression was when she was making fun of her asian parents. Other than that the best way to describe her unorignal comedy style is that it is comprised of generic and vulgar anecdotes that are more annoying to hear than funny. I think after her shows she is laughing at her audience back stage because she is managing to get away with telling awful jokes and stories and making it huge. She has the last laugh.
4,I don't know if this is their best...,"I love this group, as they clearly love cooking and have engaging personilties. I can't honestly say that I've ever felt inspired to use any of their recipes though...so I would gather that, to me, its more entertainment than anything else...I have often tried Lidia Bastianich and Everyday Food recipes...I would recommend those DVD's over these."
2,Low end!,"I have been happy with most of my chinese line of guns until I start buying the low-end of the line. Usually these are marketed under ""Techforce"", AGI (Air Gun Inc.) or simply ""Chinese import"".Most of these when pictured looks alike and the description vague. Seldom you see a model number. The obvious difference would be the caliber (.177 or .22) and the claimed fps. The one I got shouldn't pass quality control, I had a real hard time cocking this break barrel rifle until I lubed the break and play with it. I've shot over 300 shots on it and now it's manageable to cock, still not smooth. I didn't send it back because of the shipping price. This is a full size rifle at 42"" and weighing at 9 pounds. It looks, feel and kicks like a .22 short rimfire rifle.For the price, accuracy and power is commendable.mgso"
5,Simply Satisfying!,"Simply Satisfying!I've just finished watching this absolutely divine show. For some reason I didn't have hi hopes for this Barbra, mini, concert. But was I ever wrong! The show on DVD is so intimate one feels as if they're really there at The Vanguard. There is a lot of chatter from Barbra, of course, between songs, which I loved! I had the feeling it took her a couple of songs to really warm up but when she did I suddenly remembered why I have adored from afar this woman for 36 years. She blows this small audience away with ""If You Go Away"" . Yet, when Ms. Streisand dives into songs like Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered, Make Someone Happy, Nobody Heart Belongs to Me, and The Way We Were, one feels as if they have sailed on a great boat with a great love and have experienced the most satisfying afternoon of one's life. Barbra Streisand rises above the bar once again and I pray our Barbra never goes away!"
5,"One Night Only: Barbra Streisand and Quartet at the Village Vanguard - September 26, 2009","Very nice blu-ray. Not enough words to describe this amazing voice. Nice image, nice losless audio."
2,"GOOD WHEN SHE SINGS, BUT THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH TALK","I think Barbra has a GREAT singing voice. And that's what I wanted in this concert. Sad part was, it's about an hour and a half long and she only does 13 songs, with LOTS of talk between each song. Not my idea of a great concert.The ""concert"" takes place in the Village at a small place where she got her start. Only a little more than 130 people can even fit in the place. Oh, it's filled all right, but mostly with her friends (including ex-President Clinton, his wife Hillary, and their daughter Chelsea). It's as though everyone attending is ""honored"" to be in the audience just to see her.I'm sure there are much better ""concert DVDs"" featuring MS. Streisand on them. I strongly suggest saving your money on this one."
1,Lousy product description.........,No indication of song selection. No indication of what's on the DVD. Not much information period. Guess just supposed to buy on faith. I will probably buy but not because of Amazon's work here.
1,The book was so bad - that I returned it.,"Has many screens from NT 3.x (which can't exist when IIS4 is installed on a machine as it only works with NT4). Hardly covers IIS4 at all, just lots and lots and lots of very general information that can be found in beginning Internet and NT books elsewhere. I was offended by the low quality of this book."
1,Not very useful for exam prep,"In trying to include all the concerns involved in setting up a website -- especially content creation and development -- the authors left many key areas specified in the 70-87 exam prep guide inadequately addressed. Discussion of the seven basic services provided with IIS, other than the basic WWW service, is very shallow.The basic information on NT Server design and setup also seems too general to address specific hardware selection concerns."
3,Fishing line,The fishing line appears to be old. The box that contains the line was unusually worn. Would not consider the line to be new.
5,Sudden Terror--reallly interesting!,"Awesome book,from a real different perspective. I liked the fact that the author isn't just writing from an ivory tower, but has first hand experience and knowledge of what makes terrorism tick. He suggests alot of ways to cope with being victims of terrorism that have helped me through September 11th. I really recommend it to everyone, especially anyone who wants to know what it's like being a victim of fundamentalist Muslim terror in Israel."
4,I loved it,"I bought this album on a spur of the moment spending spree. I gotta say that if you like Micro then this is a must-have album. Great ""driving"" beats. Trancy album with a hint of breaks. Tracks two and 12 are my personal favorite's already. The album features many peaks throughtout it and is really dancable. If you liked his most popular album, DJMIXED.COM, you will definetly like this album. It has the same style of hard pounding beats as DJMIXED."
3,Seems Like Micro Has Lost the Spirit,"This CD is actually not that bad, but it seems to me that Micro has lost the power and energy that used to infect every album that he would produce. I have been slightly disappointed with this and his last album (Music Through Me). Something is missing from his work... Check out some of his older albums to know what I mean about 'infection'."
5,Vocal Trance,"This CD is Full of some great vocal trance tracks. I personally think Micro has outdone himself. He is my hero. Pay attention to track 9, about a minute into it it'll hit, and this is truly what it would sound like if DJ Icey were to spin trance. I love the CD."
3,Where did the power go??,"Micro is my favorite US trance dj and I have been listening to his mixes and his music since the age of 14, but lately something has been missing from his music.The thing I loved about Micro was his acidic energy-driven sets that could [beat you] and uplift you all at the same time, but his mix cds have grown weak in my opinion, granted, this cd is a hell of a lot better than ""Music through Me"".Where is the drive, the sheer energy? Where is that TECH-MIX Sound?For NU-SKOOL Micro fans this is an awesome cd, but for veteran fans since before ""Coast to Coast"", this cd is still missing something.Overall it's an excellent cd but it's too top 40 trance for me, where are the underground tracks that he used to spring on us??"
2,bsa is ok,Good 22 scope nothing bigger! Thats all i have to say about that. BSA has some good ideas on scooes hope they go bigger
4,scope,"This was a great scope for the price, seems very sturdy and durable. the only reason i am not giving this product a % is because it does not have a dial to adjust the focus. it has very good optics and was easily mounted on my crosman phantom. great buy for 20 bucks"
5,Great small scope,Once I got it sited in it was nice to us. optics are clear. price of scope was cheaper then in the sporting good stores.
2,It only lasted about 3 months!!!!,"This scope wasn't bad, but it could've been better... the other day when I was shooting my crosman phantom air rifle the croshairs fell out of place.... Amazon did take it back, though.... but before it broke, it was decent......"
4,Nice Scope for the money,"This is the perfect scope upgrade for any air rifle purchased at ""Wal-Mart"" type stores. Break barrel rifles require a specific ""air rifle"" scope do to the ""double recoil"" that these types of rifles create. This on may look like the one that came with the rifle but it is double braced. It is made by BSA who is big in the Air Rifle market. At Amazon I found the scope at half price of Cabelas and Bass Pro shops And it had FREE next day shipping! Arrived Christmas Eave at my Dad's to go with the rifle we bought him."
3,ok,This scope was a little disappointing. I know it is only $29 bucks but I thought it would be made a little better. It feels like it is made out of plastic.
4,Good Scope,"This is a great scope, for a low price and free shipping. At Cabelas this same scope is $10 more and has $8 shipping. If you have an airgun or small rifle, this is the way to go."
4,Rifle scope,I am happy with this scope. It was easy to install and very easy to sight in. I have only had it a couple of months but don't anticipate any problems with it.
2,So-So scope,"It was great for target practice with a 22 cal rifle, crossbow and bb gun. Not recommened for AK styles."
1,Defective Optics,"The optics were so bad I had to return this scope. It may have been a single bad scope, or it may be it is cheap and virtually impossible to use effectively. I've been using scopes, binoculars and cameras for decades - this is the worst I've seen. I could not bring the scope into focus - no matter where I placed it from my eye it was like looking through the wrong end. I returned it and bought a Nikon. Very pleased with that.Your mileage may vary."
3,Keeps falling off,I got this scope and out it on my 22marlin. The scope looks great on the gun. My only issue is I took it out to the range And it kept falling off the gun. I had issues with zeroing it to. I wouldn't buy this brand of scope again.
1,Absolute junk,"I'm a rifle marksmanship instructor, and I was looking for simple, inexpensive fixed-power scope to affix to loaner rifles I could give my students shooting at 25 meters. Based upon the glowing reviews I saw from other reviewers, here on Amazon, I gave BSA a chance.I won't make that mistake again.Attempting a simple box test--moving the zero a fixed distance to the right, the same distance up, back to the left, and then down--should put the point of aim back in the same place. This scope failed horizontally and vertically, and badly. I could not get this scope to return to zero, nor could a fellow instructor.The only functional use for this scope is to protect the upper receiver of a rifle from a light mist. Were it required for that purpose, however, I trust it would develop leaks.Do not waste your time."
4,Justin Timberlake - Remixed by Dirty Vegas & Basement Jaxx.,"Justin Timberlake's ""Cry Me a River"" is a seething and almost vindictive breakup jam that's been getting some mild controversy over its video which features what may be a lookalike of his ex, Britney Spears. This single has a handful of ready-for-the-club remixes; the best of the bunch is from Dirty Vegas, who give the Timbaland-produced track a neo-disco edge. Another standout is a positively trippy makeover of ""Like I Love You"" from London's Basement Jaxx. These guys inject an acid-like house groove into this single, originally produced by the Neptunes. At first, I wondered how a song like that could get a house remix, but Basement Jaxx pull it off well. Timberlake is impressively shedding out of his boyband roots by aligning himself with some hip producers and smart DJs. If you like the original version of this single, then you'll be impressed with these remixes."
5,One of my favorite shows.,Dvd's arrived in perfect shape and work well. Great show and good clean entertainment!! I recommend these to just about anyone.
5,Frasier & Amazon enthusiast & photographer as profession,"I am plaesed, as always, with the service and quality of Amazon and am very satisfied with the 9th season of the Frasier Show. The Frasier Show is always a delight and ceaselessly produces good quality laughter, always tastefully done and causing more then a chuckle!"
3,Disappointing,"This season lacks some of the edge of the previous seasons. It focuses more an extended family of characters and many individual episodes that don't quite hit home and don't serve any real purpose. Some of the trademark witty dialogue is also missing from this season and a focus on slapstick.However, as an owner of the the brilliant previous seasons, this still serves as a worthy edition. Still better that other sitcoms, just not up to its own benchmark."
1,Frasier: The complete ninth season,"I wanted all of the DVDs the same size etc... This one was by far smaller than the rest. It was the size of only one DVD, not the larger size like the rest. It would have been nice if this were in some way advertised, but apparently that is too much work."
3,Frasier - On the Decline?,"Once again, It didn't take me too long to get through this series of Frasier. As a massive fan I loved watching every episode, however, I must admit that this was the least funniest series so far. Whilst the character of Martin was on top form as usual and Ros maintained her usual sharp wit, I am still intenstly irritated by the presence of Daphne's family. They fail to reasonably portray a typical northern English family and seem surplus to requirements given the strength of the main characters. However, there is sufficient humour thoughout the series to ensure that I will definately buy Season 10 when it is released."
1,Frasier is always angry!,"I have greatly enjoyed the other seasons of Frasier, however, this season provides few laughs and Frasier is always angry and yelling at people. Several of the episodes were just plain boring and the episode with Roz and Frasier spending the night together - why was that necessary? It wasn't interesting or funny and it just ""fell flat."" I suggest you do not buy this season. I regret wasting my money on it."
5,Intelligent Humor,"The ninth season of Frasier continues the wonderful comedy one would expect from the Frasier boys. This television series has been able to generate laughs at an adult level without treating the audience like un-educated children. This season has lost nothing on the previous seasons, while developing the lives of the characters. I can't wait for season 10 to be released."
3,a collection of one-liners...,"Not a bad book, but it's a collection of one liners. ""Use coca-cola to improve x."" ""Moth balls around the base of plants help y"" and so on. Literally hundreds of one liners that it's a bit much for me, but still interesting to see how to use all of your household items in your garden."
3,Trivia + useful information,"Good things about this book;1. New uses for household items to make plants grow better.2. Interesting trivia interspersed in each chapter.3. Great bathroom reading.4. The physical reason the product works on a plant is given as well as how to do it.5. Chapters divided by types of plantsBad things about this book;1. Too many brand names!! Instead of ""chlorine bleach"" we get ""Clorox"", etc.. There should be a disclaimer someplace that ANY brand of bleach (or soda bottle, or whatever the branded product is) would work just as well.2. Needs an index for uses of a specific household item, such as ""Bleach"", or ""Epsom Salts"", etc.3. Dumb lady on the cover. My son took a glance at the book and shuddered at the fake smile, '60's dress, and retro design. I agree. I saw this book at Cracker Barrel which has a reputation for ""retro"" stuff, but I am glad I only paid $5 for it instead of $14. The cover needs a MAJOR redesign."
3,Gardening,Wife is the gardener...50+ years experience personal and commercial..she says it is OK but not necessarily for SW Texas....
5,Fabulous late 60's country-soul music!,"This is a wonderful collection of a soul duo most people have never heard? Not sure why, as it hits very hard in the southern soul vein and features the great Jerry Kennedy all over it playing electric sitar and the band has a hard hittin' soulful feel going on. While listening to this, I immediately think of Delaney & Bonnie. A similar sound and D & B actually recorded ""Soul Shake"". I think D&B had more commercial success and I'm a fan of theirs - but this stuff really takes it up a notch. If you like southern soul w/ a touch of country, this CD is a must have!!"
3,Unrevieling,"John tries to help us know Jesus and himself, but no true feelings come through. When he gets a little close to some strong feelings within himself for example, leaving the seminary, falling in love, losing that love, John switches over to talking about Jesus. It's as if he needs to hide his true feelings behind his study of Jesus. John, unless you are willing to look within yourself, you will never be successful in finding Jesus."
2,"It's ""come to you-know-who"" time.","This film is billed as science fiction and it is. It is, however, a very heavy-handed and almost continuous message for salvation via you-know-who. Not surprisingly it is produced by one of the major church organizations. A competent cast including one of the ever-present Baldwins, and if you either are sympathetic to the constantly repeated message or can avoid letting it get in your way, a moderately enjoyable sci-fi flick."
1,Not what I expected.,"Maybe I didn't understand the title correctly, but I only got the bearings them self. When I opened the package, I noticed that the Inner diameter and the radius to the face of the bearing casing had a lot of porosity. This would take some/a lot of the structural integrity away from the bearing. These were not just tiny bits they were at least half way thru the material and 2 sport over a inch in size. As far as the price if all I was supposed to receive is the bearing this is by far not the cheapest way to go and I could get a lot better quality from another vender."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Dolphins are smarter than mice.Smarter than us, too, it seems, given we have delved into the fourth book of a trilogy. In this case, you can say about this book pretty much the same thing that was said about the last one. It is different in tone to the two that are actually good, and although there are a few decent gags like the rain god thing, in general, it is a bit dull."
3,The fourth book in Adams's trilogy,"That, by itself, gets you off to a cockeyed start that will help you through Adams's brilliant series. The set was a landmark of popular culture when it came out in the 1980s, and is still a riotous trip through a universe that's just a little too believable.This book, however, just doesn't sustain the wild energy of the earlier books.//wiredweird"
2,Disappointing,"Hitchhiker fans may be disappointed by this book. It's more of an account of Arthur's life rather than involving all of the characters, and I don't think I ever laughed in reading it...though there are some interesting conclusions to things that happened in the earlier books. The ending was also disappointing."
3,Ok,This book is the only ok HHGTG book that is not to funny it has some laughs but it is buryed in a blob of junk
2,What Happened?,"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy was great. The Resturaunt at the End of the Universe was almost as good. Life, the Universe, and Everything was ok, but long sections of it were incoherent. In contrast, So Long and Thanks For All The Fish is just plain mediocre. For the most part it plods along, not only with too few laughs, but with few of the mind-blowingly original ideas found in the first couple of books. All around, it has less of the distinctive character of the other books in the series. It is also boring."
5,"""Share and Enjoy!""",I love having the complete audiobooks for the series. I spend a lot of time in transit and have this on my iPod. Lots of fun; nothing like having the author deliver his own work.
5,Beautiful,"By far, my favorite book in the Hitchhiker's series. It provided a different, almost dark feeling, and to me, a perfect conclusion to the series. (Ignoreing ""Mostly Harmless""'s existence"") This is Adams at his best, pouring out rip-roaring lines, social commentary, and a wonderfully fun, innovative, and thought-provoking read. May his work live on."
3,Not quite as good as the others.,"I didn't write reviews for the first three books, for obvious reasons. Another nine or ten would just be redundant. However, I must say something about this book. I really missed all of the old characters. What happened to them? I would really like to know. Another thing, I could tell by Adams' writing style that he was really burnt out on the trilogy. It did not seem to have the sharp quick-wittedness that permeated the other books. I also just did not laugh hardly as much as I did with the others. This book is just not as good"
2,"At this point, it all starts to go sadly wrong...","The brilliant trilogy ""Hitchhiker's Guide"", ""Restaurant"" and ""Life, the Universe"" constituted an act which was nearly impossible to follow. With this weak effort, Douglas Adams proves that he cannot follow it. Only occasionally mildly amusing. Its successor, ""So long, and thanks for all the fish"" is worse. My advice is, don't risk major disappointment, stick to the real trilogy and end with the celestial high note of ""Life, the Universe, and Everything""."
3,Meh...,"As much as a like the hitchhikers books, this one was a bit of a letdown. Throughout the entire book, the stereotypical Arthur and Fenhurch romance is playing out and I always expected green fire dragons to attack at any minute. It just doesen`t compare to traveling around the Galaxy. Meer."
5,"If you read ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""...","...you must read this! That's all there is to it. All the good old characters are back, and more importantly, the old style. Meet Fenchurch, who (I swear) is the subject of the Talking Heads hit, ""And She Was"". Find out why dolphins left Earth, and learn more about Life, the Universe, and Everything!"
4,Adams slips a bit,"Beginning a trend for the last two novels, So Long and Thanks for all the Fish is not as good as Adams' previous novels. It lacks Zaphod, Trillian, and Marvin, key elements in the comic team of the first three novels. He focuses too much on Arthur and not enough on the plot before him. Still, it is a good read for anyone who liked the previous three novels. There is still that wacky British humor that Adams cultivated so well. Ford and Arthur are still quite funny, as is Wonko the Sane and Fenchurch. Oh yes, Dent finally finds a romantic interest in this novel. Who would have thought? Well, I recommend this novel less that the previous three, but it is still a good read"
4,SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH,"I have the utmost admiration for Douglas Adams; his brilliance, imagination and his sense of the absurd are unparalleled and his type of humor is my favorite. Even so after reading much of his writing I began to suffer from a sense of sameness in this book so I wasn't thrilled like I was with his other books and got a little bored. It has been called by some one of his best and I agree. For me its just a little too much of a great thing. If you are new to Mr. Adams it's a must read as any of his books would be."
4,not the best of the Hitchhiker books,"I've read the entire series, and I certainly love Adams's books. This would have to be my least favorite of the ""trilogy,"" but it's still worth reading. It's amusing and contains several extremely funny scenes. This is a great book for anyone who like humor, offbeat characters (to say the least), and a plot with some really strange twists."
3,A real disappointment after the first three.,"This book is still good, but it was really disappointing after reading the first three. Adams is running low on ideas for this series. And where's Zaphod? He was one of the best characters."
2,Eh....,"""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" is a catchy title and worthy of the increasingly ill-named Trilogy of the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but the contents failed to live up to its three predecessors. The reason, perhaps, lies in Adams' attempt to make Arthur Dent less of ""a real jerk. An absolute kneebiter."" Arthur Dent speaks in coherent sentences, gains a fractured but otherwise normal girlfriend, STAYS ON EARTH. We see Marvin only at the end, Ford infrequently and Zaphod not at all. The ""zaniness"" just isn't there. If you're sick at home with a cold and have nothing else to read but Volgon poetry, give it a try. Your insides won't strangle you, but you won't be cured as quickly, say, if you read ""Life, the Universe, and Everything."""
3,"Funny, but not much of a plot","I didn't remember much about this book from the first time that I read it several years ago, which made me think that I didn't really like it that much. But after re-reading it, I realize that I didn't remember much becuase there wasn't much to it.What is there is good and funny, and has some interesting characters, like the Rain God, and the lady selling raffle tickets, but overall, the story just seemed too short and ended very abruptly just after it had seemed to get started.If you've read the other books, you'll probably want to read this one as well, but don't expect the same kind of story this time."
3,A Fishy Story,"Aurthur Dent, a man who has been lost in space for a long time, comes back to his house in England. When he steps into the house dust is everywhere. Then he notices a glass fish bowl. Could this be the missing link to the question ""Where did all the dolphins go?""? The answer to this question is very important. I enjoyed this book. However I think some of the other books in the Hichhiker's Guid to the Galaxy series are better. In order to to understand this book, I recobend that you read the books that come before this one in the series. If you enjoy science fiction and love novels, this is the book for you! After reading the books before this one in the series, the book shocked me. Most of the Douglas Adams books are mainly scientific but this one was mainly a romance novel. I recogmend this book to romance novel lovers."
2,Jason's review,"The first book was great, it had an interesting plot and great characters. The second book wavered on the plot, but it was still good. The third book had the characters, but the original plot was gone. It had been replaced by a confusing, uninteresting, and bad idea that had come out of nowhere.This book has not only thrown away the plot, it also practically got rid of most of the original characters. And the new plot that appeared in its place was poorly done. He doesn't explain what's going on very well, probably because he doesn't understand it himself. What was Adams thinking when he wrote this? I'm going to read the last book in the series, but I'm not sure what to expect."
2,Not my favorite,"Adams loses, I think, his creativity in this book. It's much harder to read. It also, I think, has much less of a point than the others (which doesn't say much). I do however like his take on God's final message."
3,A step backwards for Adams...,"The fourth in the madcap sci-fi/comedy series takes a misstep right from the start. It turns out Earth wasn't really destroyed, and our hero Arthur Dent returns to his Islington flat and falls in love with a woman who once knew the secret to life, but forgot it. This book would almost completely be fluff if it weren't for writer Douglas Adams' telling you how boring the book is, but how exciting the last chapter is. He's right. The book is boring, the laughs are few and far between, but the final chapter is dead-on and the only part of the book that feels like the earlier three. However, the series would only get worse with ""Mostly Harmless,"" the fifth book."
2,"Still good, but not the best.","I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as the others in the 'trilogy.'It was often to ordinary with chapter after chapter focusing on the relationship between Arthur and Fenchurch, while this is still a good book I thought it was a bit of a let down after the brilliant 'Life the universe and everything.'"
5,Buy it! Buy it!,"Definitely worth the read, Adams knows how to spin an eccentrically entertaining sequel to his previous books - that's all there is to say."
5,"Fabulous! Brilliant! (and sweet, too)","I've read the whole series, and though I never thought anything would beat the first one, I was wrong. So Long rounds out Arthur's character a bit, making him seem like less of a clod and more like a, well, man, though all of his delightful quirks are still in place. The absolute funniest scene of the series is in here (I won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you read it...think biscuits), and there's a love story to boot. In my opinion it was nice to see a little less of Zaphod and absolutely NONE of Trillion, who I couldn't stand, and though Arthur is clearly the focus Ford gets his fair share of limelight, though I do wish Marvin had been featured for more than the page or so he was on. All in all, this a great book, perhaps more slowly-paced than the rest, but it makes up for this in charm. I highly reccomend it (and I suggest anyone who likes this book skip Mostly Harmless)."
3,The least hilarious book in the series,Although this book contained one of the funniest parts in the series it did not live up to the standards set by earlier books. Adams still comes through with a few humorous points but it is not his best work.One of the most hilarious parts in the Series was god's last message to his creation.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,***ZERO STARS***I tried to enter this review with 0 stars but it is not an option. One star is one star too many. This game has been labeled as a sick joke played upon the victims world wide that have suffered from a brain aneurysm or lost a loved one to this tragic illness. Please show that you care by boycotting the game.
1,SICK SICK SICK,"Super Aneurysm/Pop Pop Pop (Jewel Case)This product does not deserve one star, but that is the lowest rating which can be submitted. It pokes fun at a life threating condition with no reegard to what it means to those with the condition. I had one and just came home after brain surgery to mitigate it before it had a chance to rupture. For those who don't know if an aneurysm ruptures in your brain you have a 50/50 chance of death or stroke. If anyone thinks that is funny you are as sick as the makers of this sicko game. The surgery is no fun either. The recovery time is long and painful. Whatever you do vote with you dollars to send the makers a message, we don't want your twisted sick game."
1,Boycott this game!,"ONE STAR IS TOO MANY. THIS IS A DISGUSTING GAME THAT MOCKS PEOPLE WITH A VERY SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITION. DON'T BUY THIS GAME...hopefully it will make a huge dent in the bottom line of the companies responsible for it.As an aneurysm survivor, I cannot begin to describe how offensive this game is to me. To my knowledge, it is the only ""game"" that ridicules a very serious medical condition. Whoever let it go on the market with such an offensive name should be fired.Amazon, I have been a good customer for years. I am VERY disappointed that you are selling this game. Please pull it from your ""shelves"" and join us in urging the manufacturer to re-brand and re-market it under a less offensive name."
1,Absolutely Appalling!!!,"This is absolutely appalling!!! I wonder what *@#&* came up with this name!! As a ruptured brain aneurysm survivor, I find nothing fun or funny about this game. Just the name alone sends my stomach churning. I can't believe a company would make light of a life threating condition such as this. Top the poor name with the write on the game itself and it's down right disgusting!! Yes, anueryms are a pain in the brain.............I spent a week in ICU. This could have killed me!!!!! Amazing that you would sell a game that the very condition the game is named from could cause the children that play it to lose a parent or other loved one!!!SHAME SHAME SHAME on the game makers.I know that there are many games and things that are sold that may offend people, but this is the ONLY disease/condition game I have ever heard of. I would rate this ZERO STARS, but that is not an option."
1,"This ""game"" is scandalous and Amazon should be ashamed!!","I am a hemorrhagic stroke survivor; this medical event is caused by ruptured aneurysms that bleed in the intra-cranial area of the brain. Most victims die within minutes. Of those that do miraculously survive (about 20% of victims) most are left with severe disabilities. They are seldom employable ever again.Some time ago I filed an FTC complaint against the monstrous Internet entity (ValuSoft, Minnesota) that peddles this game for no other reason than greed coupled with a blatant disregard for victims of aneurysm. Thus far the game remains on the market and AMAZON SHOULD PULL THIS GAME AT ONCE. It is highly unbecoming of a main line, otherwise well-respected company like Amazon to get down in the sewers with ValuSoft."
4,Stupid Name but still a fun game!,"I admit, the name of the game is not the greatest and may be offensive to some. However, the game itself has nothing to do with the medical condition. It is a fun and addictive game. I'd recommend it."
3,A Good one with a horrendous another one,"The first one it is a great humor parody of the cop movies, great jokes.. but Senior Trip is a bunch of idiots running for nothing all the movie, the jokes... are jokes in there?... fortunately, Senior trip it's free, I just buy Loaded Weapon, the other one... a great piece of nothing..."
4,"A bit boring at first, but a real page -turner later!","Caught in the middle of war. That's a pretty good discription of Mary's situation. Mary's Father is a die heart Tory,(he's loyal to the king of England, that is) witch poses a problem, seeing as her 18 year old brother, William, is a Patriot. On the night of the Peal's ball, which they have been preparing for since page one, Mary discovers an unexpected suprise in the shed... This story deals with alot of emotional subjects: :loyalty, family pride, the deep love of sister for brother, and, no matter how stubborn both might be, father for son. I thought what Mary's father did near the end was great. It brings to mind the old phrase: Actions Speak Louder Then Words. My love of history made me want to try this, and I'm very glad I did.I Loved this book!!!!"
5,Mother-Daughter Bonding,"My 16 year old daughter and I have howled nightly at this wonderfully creative show. Every character is beloved, and contribute to this amazing ensemble cast. We're hoping there's a Season 5, and yes, even a Season 6. It has been a joy and a great bonding opportunity!!! Why didn't more people see this show?"
4,"Wings is a great show, and season 4 proves it","Wings was never the same level of cheers or fraiser in it's day. Instead it was the little show that could. The comedy was always top notch, and the writing excelled. This season brought the show together than better before. The writers had characters down, and used that to make the most of the hilarious situations. The introduction of Alex was a hit or miss affair. While giving Brian a permanent love interest, her humor never properly gelled with everyone else. However, what Brian goes through to get her attention and affection more than makes up for her. The show is great, and comedies like this are hard to find. Watch it!"
4,Wings 4th Season Review,"Love this show, but wish the DVD easier to watch. For example, I cannot skip through the closing credits (I can fast forward through them)."
3,Paramount Getting Lazy,"After waiting for them to release Season 4 and the rest of the Seasons, I received Season 4 and they have removed the ""play all"" option from the menu. I have Seasons 1-4 now and want them all but I am already tire of waiting and now they have taken that option alway also. What will they do next to discourage people from buying these and just give up."
3,Mandrell Family Cookbook,I wasn't crazy about the cookbook. I just wanted a cookbook that just had regular recipes in it. This one had too many gormet recipes in it. I am in to quick cooking.
3,good entertainment,This movie is not a top notch hollywood blockbuster... BUT it is entertaining and I enjoyed watching it.
3,civil drafting technology,"I purchased this book with the hopes that it would help me understand civil drafting. There is no answer section to check my work. So,,,I do not know if I am on the right track with my understanding.Does anyone know if there is a solutions manual?"
2,Jumpy,"This was a required book for class and it didn't live up to my high standards. There is no fluidity to this book. I hope the drafters who helped write this book are better at planning road ways than planning the order of the chapters this book has. The chapters jump around too much for my liking. This book, however, is ADDA certified."
2,"Dated, generic, and overpriced","When I read the word Drafting in the title I assumed this book would focus on civil drafting as it applies to modern (CAD) technology. Instead there are many references to manual drafting which few drafters use any more. A better title would leave the technology out of the title and substitute the word theory, thus letting the buyer know that this is a generic overview of civil drafting theory, not a book that a CAD operator will get much use out of.In my estimation this book has a Value of around thirty dollars only. Unfortunately, pricing trends seem to indicate that any words committed to print by the The Gods (engineers, programmers, etc.) are worth their weight in gold, regardless of their value."
5,More Thomas!,I purchased the puzzle for my grandson who love puzzles and anything to do with Thomas and all his friends
2,puzzling remaster....,"I have to hand it to BGO (Beat Goes On Records) for salvaging worthy out of print records, but why do they continually botch up the process? This is a brilliant record, one of my favorite Tubes LPs (of the Capitol Years, that is...) and they have reshuffled the tracks, re-edited segues with pointless crossfading and the like. What gives? I have quite a few LPs on CD that BGO has faithfully put out, but very few are flawless.I don't understand what is so hard about restoring a classic album. Just go out and find the original vinyl copy, A-B it with what you've done, add some nice picture scans and put the puppy out... Quality control is much needed here.If you're in love with the original version, burn the vinyl copy to CD or find the original Capitol CD. Heck, they've botched it so bad you can't even correct the mistake by programming in the correct sequence!!! Unforgivable!!!fendemos"
5,Tubes Rule,"I loved this album back in high school. It still holds up today. I'm a little confused as to why this is now an import and why they changed the order of the songs. You know how when you have listened to an album so many times, you know exactly what song is coming next? That's not the case here if you have previously owned the vinyl version."
1,"If you must get this book, buy it USED!","I was required to get this textbook for a college class and paid the full retail price for it. The written content of the book may have been fine, but the quality is just ridiculous (and definitely NOT worth $140+)! The pages are photocopies, no joke! I was not the only student who felt ripped off (others in my class had received the same crappy quality book). We eventually brought it up to the professor, and needless to say, she was shocked. If you must get this book because it is a class requirement, buy a USED copy and save yourself the funds!"
4,HUMAN RELATIONS Personal and Professional Relations 2nd edition,This book was required by my college for a recent class. The college only sold a special edition made for them. It had pages intentionally removed. The instructor kept referring to some of those pages. I was glad to get the book at such a good price and delivered in a timely manor. And all the pages are there.
3,A little glimpse of new information,"I am the kind of person who have got a little immune to the horror of holocaust. I mean when everybody, for so many years, say the same thing again and again, ""We must never forget..."" and so on, and on, and on, and on... I just get a little tired. So in my opinion writing about the holocaust is actually a little difficult, at least if I shall be entertained by the story. I want something new! Erich Hackl actually succeeds in contributing a little new angle of information with the story about Sidonia. I don't know if the story moves me particularly, but it's interesting to read about the destiny of a little gypsy girl under Das Dritte Reich in Austria. It's slightly stupid that Erich Hackl moralizes and gets angry with the contemporary people because they obey the ideology of the day, nazism. Because, would we have been any better in their situation? Proberly not!"
3,Another book abouth the Jewish,"This true story is very simple told, but it's rather well written by Erich Hackl, the probably most famous Austrian author. I agree that's a good and important book, but I just don't like such sad, true stories about World War 2."
1,disappointing and dull,"Clarke's book should be an important contribution, but instead, the author rehashes old ideas and covers material that others have discussed in far more profound ways. If you want your vision of Oaxaca's peasants to more or less reflect theories of the 1950s and 60s--This is your book. If you want to understand how Oaxaca's peasantry have over time (and here we're talking about hundreds of years) coped and responded to the challenges of a changing world, you'll do better going to texts by John Chance, Beverly Chinas, Scott Cook, Lynn Stephen, Jeremy Baskes, Jeffrey Cohen and the many articles by these and others (particularly local Mexican scholars) that Clarke misses."
4,"Not the best Mateos' work, though still a worth listening...","Not as good as some of the previous Miguel Mateos' albums (not even to mention his Zas! band, with whom he published his best records yet...), but a couple songs and the whole album concept deserve a 4 star rating.If you want to know his better-crafted side, then grab a copy of 'Solos en América' or 'Atado a un Sentimiento' but, on the other hand, if you prefer to listen to his mainstream/pop side then get yourself a copy of 'Obsesión'.This one stands in the middle of both sides, with a couple pop tracks, and other songs being more experimental... even including an english spoken ballad, perhaps as a result of his seasons living in the States.Worth having, but not as good as others definitely."
5,"En la variedad, esta el gusto...","Este es un CD con una gran propuesta musical. Cada tema esta fabricado con una quimica especial y diferente.Mateos demuestra su talento una vez mas, al editar un album cuya tematica principal, se basa en la diversidad de ritmos. No se olvida de sus origenes rockeros, pero muestra la evolucion que ha tenido como musico y como ser humano, y plasma en este album el aprendizaje y la sensibilidad que ha adquirido tras recorrer de punta a punta el continente Americano llevando tras de si, su musica y su gran bagaje de historias.Desde ""Caprichos Blues"", ""Danza Peligrosa"", si tuvieramos alas"", hasta ""You are the one"", o el sorprendente: ""Vertigo"" (este tambien editado en version Mix-acustico), Mateos nos ofrece un suculento platillo de temas que haran bailar a mas de un rockero..."
4,"Nice, for an inexpensive large toy","I've had this for a long time, and only recently have I been able to stretch far enough to take it. It's very big, at about 2.75"" diameter. The head is fairly pronounced, and generates a fairly shocking 'pop' sensation when it goes in. This really isn't great for bouncing on or vigorous use, as it's so big it really pushes your stretch limits. It's also so enormously long that it's a bit ridiculous - you only ever use the first few inches. Maybe someone somewhere can take it all, but I certainly can't!Anyway, it's a nicely constructed, good quality toy, but it is VERY large."
5,aaaammmaazzing,I am a male using this and its amazing. Took me about an hour to get it in but dam it was worth it. Hope you like big things because its big and fills you up. Also a great price for it.
4,Nice for the money,"Bigger than I expected. I'm a guy who enjoys large toys. Use lots of lube. I would also recomend an 18 inch double header prior to using this one to spread lube more evenly. I also recomend silicon based lube. Great toy for the money, but be careful. It's not for beginners. Be safe and have fun!"
5,Just The Right Size,"Im a guy and this dildo is awesome!!! and can stretch you really wide. It that perfect size to stretch you and let you have a good time. It is easy to clean and can get really slippery when lube is applied. If you bored of your old medium size dong you can shove completely inside of you and you want more... This would be the great next step of pleasure.PS, I recommend that you be an expert for this dildo. You're not gonna get it in on your first try :3"
2,Does not mate up cleanly to the Barebones solo seat.,"Does not mate up cleanly to the Barebones solo seat on my 2002 Dyna Lowrider. This pillon is okay, just not a real good fit. Also, the rear attachment to the fender is a little sloppy looking, probably due to the pillon being designed to fit so many bikes. It is not easy to see what it will look like without installing it. Powersport Superstore would not allow a return after the seat is installed, because it looks used."
1,Very cheap.,"These broke when I was screwing them into the wood (in pre-drilled holes). Specifically, the screw broke where it attaches to the hook. I managed to get one screwed in all the way without it breaking. I tugged on it a bit with my pliers to test it and it broke free with hardly any effort (2-3 lbs weight)."
1,not safe,"We bought this chest to use as a toy box. We thought it would be safe for children. The lid on the chest is way too heavy. When it is lifted open, it slams shut - and with a heavy lid like that, it could cause a serious injury. Unfortunately, if I pay to have it shipped back it would be really expensive so I am stuck with a toy chest that I cannot keep around my children. Also it arrived very dusty and with some of the harware missing which leads me to believe that it was either returned by someone who found it dangerous, or it had been hanging around a warehouse or store for a very long time. Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Dumb, but funny","The Munsters are good for lots of laughs from these movies that are almost nonstop dumb jokes & gags. The script, music, and much of the acting leave a lot to be desired, but Herman (Frankenstein's monster) makes up for it.The first movie, Munster Go Home, was the best. It has a haunted mansion, a road race, a family feud, young love, and crooks. It's quite clean and I believe kids will enjoy it. The kisses aren't quick pecks, in case that bothers you. Herman also mentioned wanting to get stoned at a party, which is quickly vetoed by his wife.The Munsters' Revenge was a little disappointing. Museum monsters, including replicas of the Munsters, are really robots controlled by thieves. Mother and Son were pretty much left out of the plot that is dominated by Dad and Grandpa. We do get a little more of Spot though. Mother has definitely aged and her neckline has gotten noticeably lower."
3,Stupid movies,"There is nothing wrong with this-just not the best Munsters. One of the movies was kind of cute, the other was a dud."
5,"First movie is great, the second one kinda lame","The first movie is just as I remember the Munsters, but the second one is a lame made-for tv movie that doesn't even have all the original cast members, and the original members that are involved look a bit scary, except it's not the makeup...!"
5,Great DVD,Fantastic DVD. These old school shows are awesome! My niece loves it and looks forward to having all the seasons and all the movies.
4,Twin Broadswords,"Service from supplier was excellent. It appears that the supplier had problems with broken scabbards from their chinese supplier. These are combat steel swords and the weight is further away from the guard than on the lighter spring steel blade or wushu steel ones. For me, the weight is right and I like the weight further from the guard. I causes me to focus on proper technique as they do not allow me to just whip them around as I can my wushu steel ones. There isn't a centerpiece inside the scabbard to keep them separate and the swords do not stay inside the scabbard if I turn the scabbard down; the blades fall out. However, I did not buy this set for scabbard, I bought if for the blades. I always love that tiger claw provides a carrying case for the weapons. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and felt that it was a worthwhile investment. If you want nicer, harder-steel blades, then look to paying a lot more for a custum made pair. The price is appropriate for these blades."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I hope that I just got a really bad pair on accident.Everything about these swords were messed up. There are cracks going down the scabbard and dents at the top where the swords are supposed to go in.There isn't a center piece so each sword has their own slot. The handles are split apart while the swords are in.The swords themselves are in awful condition too.The handles look as if they have been super glued on. You can even see residual glue.Pieces of the handle are even crooked. The blades themselves are really scuffed up too. One of them is even crooked.The blades are very heavy (which I like), but they are not centered correctly.All of the wight is towards the top of the swords. One sword is even heavier then the other.I really hope that someone just stuck the wrong pair in the box for me."
4,It was Aight,"I heard this joint and [it was] cool, they got some aight trackz on the cd & the beatz bangin' ..."
2,MCQs for final MRCOphth,"The questions are well-written with good explanation. However,they are not searching enough and are rather easy. END"
1,Stay away from Viewsonic!!!!!!!,We purchased this TV over 1 year ago.1 month later IR stopped working on TV - no remote. Support sent me a new remote and closed my ticket. We just used the Digital Box remote but have to adjust sound manually. 4 months ago coax connector just stopped working - have to now use A/V cable from box.Now sound is completely distorted - speakers on TV are toast.We are running out of work around options.This TV is just junk.DO NOT BUY
1,Broke in 6 months--don't buy this one,"I purchased this TV ""new/reconditioned"" and it broke 6 months later.Turns out that, despite the explanation that a ""new/reconditioned"" item is returned to ""new"" condition, Viewsonic only warranties it for 90-days (rather than the 1-year warranty given with a ""new/new"" product).Guess it's on my head that I didn't realize that I should've counted myself lucky for that full extra 90 days of television watching that I got after that initial 90 days of warranty coverage.I'll never buy another Viewsonic product and I will be VERY VERY careful from here on out to read the fine print in ANY reconditioned product warranty that I consider."
3,An important subject that probably deserves more...,"The execution of Mary Dyer is an unfortunate but important part of the early history of the American colonies. She is still a relatively unknown historical figure. I was eager to read this book, and my Quaker meeting's first day school group for adolescents read it together as well. I wanted very much to think highly of it, but it frustrated me, for some of the reasons given in the editorial review. I feel that it isn't sufficiently scholarly or serious--it often reads like a middle school social studies text, and I think Mary Dyer, in all of her own frustrating complexity, deserves better."
4,A Story Worth Reading,"I selected this book to learn about the life of my 10th great grandmother Mary Dyer. After reading this book, I discovered my prior knowledge of the early American colonies lacking, especially in regards to religious practices and freedoms, or lack of freedoms for the non-Puritan in the early days of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The story of Mary Dyer is a story of spiritual discovery - wrestling with grace and works, choosing conviction over comfort and seeking a personal relationship with Christ while literally laying down her own life to stand against religious intolerance. This book tells the story missing from many classrooms. Some colonists may have crossed the Atlantic seeking religious freedom, however many of these same colonists were intolerant of beliefs different from their own. While the prose is not eloquent and the author takes some liberties, if you want to dig deeper into the struggle for freedom in America, read this book."
5,Neil Finn's most soulful album,"Everyone goes on and on about Neil Finn's songwriting skills and it's true -- he's up there with Lennon and McCartney, Difford and Tilbrook, Andy Partridge, etc. as far as being a genius popmeister. But ""Temple"" means so much more within his personal musical pantheon: it's when he finally shook off his brother Tim's shadow once and for all; it's a brutally honest view of marital problems and personal redemption; he's never duplicated the greatness of these songs, both lyrically and melodically; it has some of his best vocals and guitar work; and finally...it just bowls you over with its pure, unadulterated heart. I can't think of any other album, save possibly ""Blue"" and ""Hejira"" by Joni Mitchell or the Beatles' ""Rubber Soul,"" that has hit me so squarely and profoundly on both an emotional and spiritual level. It's that great. If you've never heard it, do yourself a favor and BUY IT NOW."
4,Temple of Low Men,"I got this album because my favorite actor, Charles Mesure, sang one of the songs in an interview for StarJam in Los Angeles in 2006. I found out about the interview on the Internet recently and wanted to listen to the song he sang. I'm not a music reviewer, but I like a lot about this album.My favorite song is ""Into Temptation"" that inspired an idea for a story with a part for Charles Mesure to play in the movie version. The song is lyrical and exciting and seductive. Good job, Neil Finn!""Better Be Home Soon"" is second favorite with the lovely chorus.I also liked the lowdown ""Mansion in the Slums"" and ""When You Come"" that reminds me of a Neil Diamond song. I enjoy listening to these so much that I short-change the others that deserve more attention. It's all good."
3,"Works as intended, included instructions poor","The item itself: 5 stars ...the included instructions: 0 stars. My average comes to three stars. I'm pretty hardware savvy, way more-so than the average jellystone bear, but this instruction book (really its a 4"" square of paper) stunk on ice."
2,Poorly manufactured and uses more ports than it needs to,"This product barely fit in my 3.5"" drive bay, and scraped against the sides as I put it in. Moreover, it breaks down the USB cables into individual sets of pins for some reason (even though there's a standard format for internal USB connectors) and requires one motherboard connector for each front USB port. Again, each front port needs *its own* motherboard USB connector -- if you don't have four separate USB expansion connectors free on your board, don't bother."
1,Garbage,This product died right away when I installed it. Started smoking and everything. Returned it and got a refund.
1,Didn't Work,"Product didn't work. One of the USB ports appeared to work ok, but the other ports, including the audio ports didn't work.The computer case that I had, only had two USB ports on the front of the case and no audio. Figured I would supplement the USB ports with a few more, and add easier access to the audio ports as well.Ended up replacing the computer case with a more modern one, so didn't need this after all.But the one star is no slight on Amazon...Thanks to Amazon's great return policy, it was a breeze returning this item."
4,Watch the tight headphone jack fit!,This Silverstone replacement panel looked like it would fix all the problems I had with a very bad front panel I got stuck with in a bundle deal. The original panel only had 1.0 USB ports and my motherboard has 2.0 and the headphone jack and microphone jacks would not seat properly. The Silverstone panel was very easy to install and fixed my USB issues and the microphone jack worked great but I still had a problem with the headphone jack not seating properly. Just before sending the unit back to Amazon I figured out that the jack was not going in far enough and I had to hold the case with one hand a really force it in. But once in it works great so I'm good with everything about this panel. Hopefully with use the jack will loosen up some. Buy this panel to fix a cheap computer case.
5,Robust,"The FP32B fits in a standard diskette bay, but requires a diskette drive adapter faceplate and brackets for a larger drive bay. All cables are robust, emanating from I/O jacks encased in solid plastic. Includes schematic printout for easy hacking should you want to convert the AZALIA/AC'97 dual audio connector. Each USB port has its own 4-pin connector, and the 1394 has both the straight-forward connector and individual wire connectors for unlimited options. Shipping on this item was very fast, arriving in under 24 hours."
5,SilverStone Drive Bay,I had a computer customer that chose their own case for a build. After it was done they didn't like that the rear speakers couldn't be shut off due to the case they chose had AC97 front connections and the motherboard had HD Audio. HD audio requires jack detection and AC97 doesn't provide it. The drive bay cures the problem it worked great.
5,Works Great. Awesome Deal,"I wanted an Azalia audio port for my computer and for this price and useability, its great! didnt have all 4 connections for the USB in my comp, so i just hooked up the lower two."
4,Jazz For Romantic Moments,"The songs compilation is very well thought of bringing back some of the nostalgic titles like It's Magic, When You Wish Upon A Star, I can't Give You Anything But Love and others. To me they do bring back the romantic moments back in the good old fifties and the sixties.The music may be ""old"" but the way they are played and the recording quality are superb bringing out the best in them. Especially Sonny Stitt, Houston Person and Kenny Burrell played the music with their own immaculate style."
2,not a good buy for my class,I purchased this study guide it hopes that it would aid in studying for my tests. Unfortunately it doesn't really work with they way my instructor teaches the class & the areas she highlights on.
5,Maternity Nursing 7th Edition,The book was in great condition! Looked brand new and arrived in only a couple of days!
4,Maternity Nursing,"I ordered this book and really did not need to because the Wong book has the same material. But I have been using this book and find it easy to read. I think it is the PN level, but is a good review. This study guide used with the Wong study guide is good because it presents the material in 2 different formats. This helps me to look at the material in 2 ways."
4,a great study guide for exams.,This was a lifesaver for my exams. It went along prefectly with all the chapters of the hardback. The binding wasn't great but it was definitely worth what I paid.
3,Falling apart,The content of the book has been very helpful for my nursing class and test content. The book is not well made. I've used the book for a few weeks and already the binding is coming apart on the last page of the book. I only need it for the next 6 weeks until the semester ends and I just hope it can hold on that long.
4,Service Manual - Great Stuff,"Unless you are going to buy an actual GM service manual, this is the way to go!"
4,Yet another repair manual,I am very pleased that the manual is even newer than stated as mine covers up to the 2004 models. This manual covers all that I would be doing but does not go into detail on the 4.6 Northstar engine which is fine as I do not have the tools nor the knowledge to go that deep. A good manual for the novice.
1,NOT WORTH IT !,"I was robbed! THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP! Was not worth $60...REALLY ????If I could give it minus 5 stars,thats what I would of given it."
1,An awful misinterpretation of Herbie comics,"This comic contains one of the three post-1960s Herbie stories, and it is by far the worst. People have read this and written terribly negative comments about Herbie, but let's be clear. The Herbie in this story is nothing like the Herbie of the 1960s. John Byrne's Herbie is selfish and twice risks serious injury to his mother. The real Herbie would never ever do this. It would be like Superman slapping Lois Lane and then hunting down Lana Lang for more of the same. Although that is enough to condemn this story, it is also not funny, and the drawings are a poor likeness to Herbie."
3,From reviews thought it was going to picture heavy,SO i bought this book for ideas to implement in art abd thinking i would see what symbols meant what and nice big pictures i was a bit disappointed with this book. Tons of information so ill enjoy reading but this book isn't what i was looking for.Pictures are small and black and white in case anyone is wondering. It has a long introduction briefing you on the period than goes to dictionary style with text on the left and small images to go along with some of the symbols.Again especially after hearing a tattoo artist review this book and say he uses it for reference i thought the pictures would be more frequent and of better quality
5,"An excellent book: A ""MUST BUY""","-- *VERY* COMPREHENSIVE; an excellent book: A ""MUST BUY""Anyone serious about understanding the Aztec mind and social order should read both ""Time and Sacrifice in the Aztec Cosmos"" (K. A. Read) and also, ""THE JADE STEPS"" by Burr Cartwright Brundage (University of Utah Press; (c)1985; ISBN# 0-87480-247-4). FYI, Dr. Brundage has authored nearly a dozen extraordinarily well written and researched books on Aztec civilization; most are (sadly) tough to find."
1,Maya.... Not So Much,"This book is aimed more twards the Aztec then the Maya. They take a second seat. If your more into Mayan writing and symbols theres better books out there. Its still an interesting book to flip threw, buy a used one thats low priced.They need to take the Maya off the end of the title if they reprint it to be fair. Better books out there but its something to add to the Yucatan personal library. If you have read alot of the good books out there, your likely to be a little disappointed reading this one."
2,You will get not what you see,"I've got completely different guides, all made from plastic, without metal base as on seller's picture. I publish the photo of what I've received. The package, however, was delivered ahead of scheduled time. I put two starts because the right and good quality picture of a stuff you are buying over the internet is the most important part of its description."
3,This is more of a training sword,"When I took Kung Fu, I was learing chinese broad sword. This was the sword we used. It is not stiff in any means, but it will bend to a high degree. It makes a really cool sound if you wiggle it back in forth and it you jab it just right, it makes a very ""powerfull"" sound. It's very hard to cut stuff with it, which I do not recomend doing. It is a traing sword."
5,Love them!,Our local library uses these for story time! My almost 2 y/o daughter loves them- they are perfect for children of all ages! They are very sturdy too!
3,does the job,"Needed one like this for one of my customers old emachine slim desktop with a bad gpu that came back alive after installing this card. Comes with driver CD and OK on lower end computers, not recomended for any type of intense gaming. this card works with vista and the older versions of windows, but there are no drivers available for windows 7."
3,just what my son wanted but didn't work for application he wanted,"I ordered this video card for my son at his request. He is very computer knowledgeable andsaid this would suit his needs just fine. But once he got it, it did not work for the intended application for his game as he intended. He ended up using it for something else, but was disappointed in it."
5,"A smart, well made independent film",I caught this film at the New York Independent Film Festival last year and remember it as being one of the best films there. It deals intelligently and honestly with a story of an inner city kid with a learning disability without lecturing us about the problem. The film is entertaining and unpredictable while remaining educational and thought provoking. A good buy.
4,"Starts with a whimper, ends with a bang","The casting director should be fired. This is an almost perfect movie with some very wooden actors in it. The writer shows a big range of emotions and keeps us guessing till the end. What counts is the impactful last scene. And here the acting jumps up a hundred notches to accommodate the twist, the photography and the music, and forces us to forgive every mistake made earlier on in this film."
4,beautiful,"I could not imagine anyone could make Manhattan look so beautiful. This movie makes Amelie look dull. Scene after scene is a joy to look at. It is wonderful to see that the producers have taken time to think about and carefully lay out the story so visually. The story itself is touching and contemplative. Unfortunately the perfomances at times were just too ordinary, which prevents me from giving it a perfect five."
5,Works great,I currently have 7 of 7 ports filled and it's doing fine. It's not meant for charging iPads etc which is something to note but for extra ports on my MacBook Pro its perfect.
4,Working great!,"I searched through a lot of USB hub reviews when I came across this one. It's a powered hub so when my laptop is off I can still use to to charge my phone, Garmin etc. So far it is working well. Worth the price."
4,Great so far.....,"I bought this simple because I needed a USB hub that was bigger than the one I have. I was sick of having to plug/unplug different wires and everything was a jumbled mess. I have reorganized everything. I have 3 external drives, a printer, a cooling fan, and my phone charging cord connected to it. EVERYTHING runs fine through it. I do like the external power adapter which keeps a strain off of my laptop.I have lots of music, movies, tv shows,etc that I am copying to digital format. This allows me to organize all my stuff between two drives and backup my laptop on another. The power cord and USB cable slots are on the rear, keeping it out of the way of the 7-ports usable on the front. 4 stars for now."
4,Good,The product is good. I was a little worried after reading some users had a hard time connecting it to their usb ports. Mine is a little loose in the port but works just fine. It's really quite handy and I'm glad I have it.
1,Stopped working.,"I've had this hub on my Mac (PowerPC - OS 10.4.11) for a while now and it sporadically stops working. I unplug it or swap the connections around and then it works again, but who wants that. In short, it's failing. And to update (6/2011) - it's pretty much failed now and I have to replace it."
4,7-port USB hub.,"My challenge:Connect an IR receiver, and Xbox 360 controller for Windows to my home theater/gaming PC via a 50' USB (PTC 15 m / 49 ft USB2.0 Active repeater / extension M/F cable - Supports High speed 480 Mbps data rate.) extension cable at the same time.My findings:The extension cable has worked from day one for my IR receiver. Recently gotten into gaming on the PC, but I refuse to sit at my desk chair to play a video game. A standard USB hub would not allow both devices to function while plugged in at the same time...rather the controller would not power up.My solution:Purchased and installed this powered USB hub at the end of my 50' USB extension cable. Connected both IR and controller, and tested. Both work perfectly. Great product."
5,Works!,"It works. That's all that I care about with this item. Ample plug-ins, compact and easy to set up. Recommend."
4,Good but Fishy,"It seems like the high voltage power-brick is what makes this hub capable of multiple power-hungry devices. However, I cannot find any information about the manufacturer of this product; maybe it's a nameless Chinese generic product. What I am concerned is that it may overpower the devices and burn or damage pricey gadgets. If you pay close attention to hubs from famous makers, they offer some kind electronic regulation (sorta like surge protect)."
1,DOA,"Product smelled of cheap plastic when I opened the container (you know, like gasoline). Plugged it in to my Windows 7 machine, but it couldn't identify the device and after 10 minutes of trying declared it to be defective. Packed it up and sent it back the same day. Guess I should have gone with a name brand."
4,Serves its purpose but…,"…even with its dedicated power supply, it does not have enough juice to charge an iPad.Otherwise this USB hub does its job. Lots of USB ports in a very small footprint. Nice price."
4,Power for those extra devices,I was very pleased with this hub in that it is powered and provides all that is needed for my needs. I was a little disappointed with the construction. I installed it in a location that was accessible to get at but out of the way and out of general sight. When doing so the back of the unit came off - but snapped back in place and has been working flawlessly.I would recommend this hub.
4,Solid economical solution for powered USB hub,Power cord is a good length. Has charged ipod/iphone quickly so far. Genuine USB 2.0 transfer speeds so far from digital video camera. Seems sturdier than other USB hubs I've had. Doesn't charge iPad.
1,Didn't work with usb-powered external hard drives :(,"I had high hopes for this hub based on the reviews. I currently have 4 external hard drives that I use for backups. Three are USB, but only one of them is self-powered (AC). The other two are Western Digital USB-only hard drives, so they get their power from the USB port. When I plugged these drives into the hub, their power lights turned on, but the computer didn't recognize them. I tried all the ports, and just one of the drives at a time. Nothing. Usually I can feel the little hard drives inside the enclosures spin up, but that didn't happen when I plugged them into the hub, so obviously this hub couldn't power them up, even though the hub itself is self-powered. Very disappointed."
5,Great USB Hub,"This USB hub works perfectly with my iMac and all of my peripherals. I own a media company and this serves a central hub for all of our cameras, video cameras, and microphone inputs."
1,powers off / on at random,"purchased 3/5/11. no problems with the vendor/ amazon, however the product is junk. after working with out any problems for 3/4 months it started to power off / on at random. when it would power on the printer (hp all in one) was lost and would require a reinstall... not fun. windows would fine the hd (2) but they were unreadable and needed to be formatted... unacceptable! this happened occasionally at first. now its happening 2 to 5 times a day. if i am working with files on one of these hd, or printing the whole system crashes. all i am looking for is something that works and is reliable!!"
3,Works great for everything but iPad charging,"I intentionally purchased this hub so I could plug in high-powered devices (card reader, iPad, external hd). It's worked great for all but the iPad - the connection is fine and I'm able to update/edit what's on the iPad like normal, it just won't charge."
4,"Works great, but won't charge an iPad2","I've got mine connected by my iMac to help organize my peripheral devices off my desk. I have a USB-powered scanner, USB headset, and iphone charging cable connected. Everything works great.However, when I connect my iPad2 via the USB hub, it says ""not charging"". It will still let my sync just fine, but the lack of juice to charge my iPad is annoying. That means I have to connect the cable directly to the back of the computer to charge the pad."
2,Does not have enough power for iPad,"This is a decent hub that worked flawlessly so far, however it has one shortcoming, which is that it does not have enough power to charge an iPad..."
1,No Driver - It's generic,"I have win xp pro, 32 bit, on a dell latitude e6500.The product did not come with a driver cd.When I inserted it into my pc's usb port, I checked the box allowing windows to connect to the internet to find a driver - but it didn't find one.The dialog box said, ""A problem occurred during hardware installation Your new hardware might not work properly.""I hooked up a scanner, two printers, and a promethean board (with an extension usb cable) to it but it did not work. It also did not work with only one scanner (hp scanjet 7000) attached to it.The product was generic as advertised - with no manufacturer's name printed on the product's packaging.Since the product did not work for me and there was no technical support given for me to contact, I had no recourse but to order a return for this item."
1,Lousy device,"I have an amatuer astronomy setup connecting mount, CCD camera, focuser, rotator to a USB hub connected back into the house via a active extended USB cable. I was adding a controller and a USB signalled power strip which would bring up the total connections to 6. Reading that some USB devices have problems beyond 4 connections I read the reviews on Amazon and based on that selected this device.Bad advice.......The generic USB device could not detect the focuser or rotator at all. I had fixed it to a surface with velcrow to keep it in place. When I went to remove it the bottom came off.I switched back to my Tripp-lite 7 port hub and connected to all the devices with no problem.I sometimes think these reviews are seeded by the manufactoror or vendors of the product, especially in this case since they stressed reliability when in fact they could not recognize devices others hubs could.Out $+30."
1,Sending it back,It is junk. cheap plastic. takes a very long time to charge and it starts charging about 5 mins after you plug it in. I dont think its worth the money. I can get something alot better in Radio Shack for the same price. way too expensive .
5,Works great for my needs,I bought this USB hub for several reasons.1. I needed more spaces to plug in my USB devices.2. I use a wireless adapter to connect my desktop to the internet and I kept losing the signal (My computer is upstairs and my router is in the basement). I figured that using a powered USB hub would increase the signal strength for my wireless adapter. It worked perfectly. I have not lost my internet connection since I began using this device. It has been a month now.
3,MUTE POINT,"Courageous Oscar winner Marlee Matlin (Children of a Lesser God) stars as a deaf mute who becomes embroiled in a devilish plot formulated by crooked cop Martin Sheen. She's in possession of a rare coin stolen at Sheen's bequest, and she doesn't know she's got it. Reporter John C. McGinley (dependable as always) hid the coin in her cell phone; his buddy D. B. Sweeney (in a useless Stephen Baldwin impersonation) is called on to help when it looks like Matlin is next on Sheen's hit list. While it's a sturdy thriller, its pace is sometimes static and slow, impeding any true suspense. The ending is fairly predictable and Matlin's attempts to pull an Audrey Hepburn Wait Until Dark admirable, but the movie collapses on itself."
3,Marlee Matlin does great job.,Marlee Matlin has a number of films out and this is one drama that will keep you guessing until the end who is the real villan.
5,Nail-biting suspence!!!!!,"This movie was really good. I liked the way the protagonist of this movie tries to figure out what they want from her, and how she can stop them. All throughout this movie I was wondering what was going to happen to the main character, and I was on the edge of my seat. It had so much suspence, and if you view this movie, you will see it for yourself the way it never lets up and delievers heart-stopping performances by all the actors. This was just a really good movie!!!!"
5,A Classic,"Amazing... The ending was a complete and total surprise. It's a classic. Everyone acts good. The plot is quite unpredictable, and I like that in movies... See this movie, and it's well-rounded performance will not disappoint you."
5,A fascinating response to critics of globalization,"Professor Graham does an excellent job of sifting fact from fiction on the topic of globalization. Although he admits that globalization has its problems, he demonstrates that many of the arguments advanced by the critics of this historical process are not correct. He points out accurately that globalization is inevitable and humanity would be better served by efforts to correct the problems associated with it, rather than by a futile attempt to derail it. As so many other writers have observed with regard to the capitalist system, it is generally a force for good in the world--as long as we address its failings. To put a stop to it would greatly add to human misery, rather than alleviating it."
5,Not what you expected,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film at Kevin Smith's Vulgarthon years ago when they debited JSBSB and have been waiting for it to be released. Jeff Anderson steps away from his Randal role and shows another side, writing and staring in this movie. It is not Clerks, but fans of the genre shouldn't be disappointed. Essentially a comedic love story that can be appreciated by everyone. Too bad it was never released in theaters."
3,OK for a first time filmmaker,"This is one of those films you watch once and never again or at least not for awhile. The movie kind of drags on and you'll say, ""Get to the point, already!""This film is funny, but not over-the-top, so don't expect it to be anything Kevin Smith-like.It's amazing how Anderson was able to write from a man's point of view as well as a womans. The DVD bonus features has a Q&A; with the director and someone asked Anderson how he was able to do that. (I believe he said he watches a lot of Oprah.)For a first time writer/director,Jeff Anderson did an okay job."
1,Mowing over a dog is funny ? ?,I guess if your idea of funny is a drunken loser mowing over a dog then this is a Five Star Gem. I almost never quit a movie...but hey this one did that for me. Now my high hopes for Red State are tempered.
2,Leo's Gone Soft on Us,"I have been buying Leo's Tech Almanac for 3 years now, and I have to say I am really disappointed in this year's edition.When you look through the book, it's attractive enough - big images, large photos of the TechTV authors on each page, huge sidebars - but thats the problem - there's hardly any content! Instead they have decided to make the insides light and fluffy, but no real meat to most of it.While I was waiting on this book, I purchased the PC Magazine Technology Almanac, and I think its much better - heavy on useful content, and light on silly images and icons. Plus I got a free subscription to the magazine.If you like redundant lists of writer's favorite dinosaur video games, you will like this book. If you are looking for a daily update on stuff you can really use, look elsewhere."
2,So?,"After all the annoying hype Leo gives this tome, you would think there would be something special in here. Instead, it's rehashed filler that you can find just as easily on the web for free. If you are fan of Leo's (for whatever reason) buy this book. If you're looking for a way to learn PC tips, tricks and in-n-out's, there are a million other more worth books with title worlds like ""tips, hacks, steps"" etc. If you are looking for a gift for the geek in your life, sadly, this is not worth the price of admission. You'd do better to look at the Amazon bestseller list here and see what people here really want."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book because I enjoyed Mr. Laporte's show. I must say this book is nothing like the show. It did not help me use the computer. Instead it tells people how Mr. Laporte feels a computer should be used. I emailed Mr. Laporte to ask for help ,but he has not answered to this day."
2,This is the most boring book,I have never read something that is so boring. It is somewhat hard to understand also. The writer uses many difficult words in the text. I still can't believe how boring this book is.
5,excellent!!,"Method excellent for making people that are learning english as a second languange, to speak and to unsderstand spoken english"
5,The greatest work of prose that you have never heard of,"And the Waters Prevailed is one of the greatest works of prose literature in recent history. The tone of the writing is incomparably eloquent, and the book's philosophical message is one which cries out for an audience, anywhere, to simply listen. In my top five works of all time, easily --Read This Book!"
4,Great Purchase!,"The book I purchased was in great condition. Even thought the shipping charge was greater than the cost of the book, it was worth the cost."
2,Not compatible with other HP All-in-ones.,"This may be a great printer, but if you have another HP All-in One installed, it requires that you uninstall the other printer or, if you call tech assistance, they can tell you how to set it up so that you can use one as a printer only. I bought one, drove to a job assignment 150 miles from a retailer, prepared to set it up, and found out that it was not compatible with my HP PSC-750. One or the other had to be uninstalled. Also requires a different ink cartridge than most other HPs, also a negative. I use one printer in my truck and one in the office, and need to have both installed on my laptop. Guess I would need to buy a different brand of printer/copier for the truck to use this. Too bad, I would have loved the print speed..."
1,"Too many features, no function","I have struggled with this machine from the beggining. It is a case of a machine trying to do too much and not getting anything right. If you need very basic limited quantities printing, scanning and faxing then it is ok. Trying to create photo projects and printing graphics is a nightmare- for every one print, there are 3 that go wrong. Also does not handle well for irregular sizes- cards etc., must hand feed, no batch printing. Not worth the money or the space savings, and HP does not stand behind the product."
1,Ink RipOff Indeed,"It recognizes expired ink carts and pretty much disables the machine. I can't believe it. We loaded up on ink at one time when we had money, and now we're forced to throw away all this ""expired"" ink, which would most likely work just fine. This is an obvious ploy to keep you buying more ink, and I'm offended by it. I will be checking for this feature (flaw) when I shop for my next printer."
1,Not ready for Prime Time,"The HP d145 is a new product that I took a chance on.I had it for one evening most of which I spent on the computer with HP on-line support.There were problems initializing the machine after the printhead and print cartridges were installed which required a ""secret code"", only known by HP, to unlockThe install documentation is abysmal.The final straw was when I finally got it hooked up and the FAX didn't work. After another hour on the support line, the tech support person said that I needed to make an appointment with an HP service person.I will be returning it to Staples tomorrow for a refund.My biggest concern is not these problems but the idea that my business would be without a copier, a printer, and a FAX if anything at all goes wrong with this kind of unit.Buyer beware. Certainly not worth the risk."
5,D145 The best unit I ever bought,"Great Unit. Setup was easy and worked flawlessly under Windows 2000, XP and ME systems in my house.Its a bit loud and uses lots of ink but worth the investment !Best product I have owned hands down....."
2,145 is a BUST,"I hate to say it but this thing is a BUST. The photoshop & print features are very good, as is overall quality but....The scanning features as they relate to data transmision directly to Word do nit function in the XP environment. 2 hours with Tech support on the phone did not help. All they did was give a ""backdoor"" to make it work. That isOK, but for [item price] you would expect full functional;ity in all features.BEWARE XP users.....I returned it and went with a Canon product."
2,No 800 Phone support,"The other reviews did not mention these problems.There is no 800 Phone support from HP. After being left on hold for over 30 minutes it became obvious that HP was not going to support help me on the instalation problem I was having, the Ink Carriage would not center for loading of ink. Three hours to install a printer!There was no documentation that stated that you cannot write to the Memory Card. To get high quality scans you must run a seperatre program. Both were key reasons for buying this product. Also, to network this printer or to use parallal cable requires very expesive attachment.Still looking at the other features work, but will probably return this by the end of the week."
2,"Great when it works, (which is rare)","This machine is conceptually great, but very unreliable. It breaks down quite often, and there are constant problems with the scanner and print heads."
3,Fair multifunction performance,"Performance from this multifunction Officejet is inconsistent. Maybe its just me but it tends to mangle envelopes when attempting to print, is a temperamental fax machine and it requires rebooting (shut down the unit, wait 10 seconds and boot back up)once or twice a month. Unit is also extremely noisy. On the upside, Unit prints and copies consistently well and the plug-in flash card feature for printing photos is quite handy. I suggest demoing competitive models before deciding on this Officejet model."
2,Constant support needed,If you have a network be aware that this can be a nightmare to keep the manager working. On one of my computers I gave up the manager and used the scanner from other software which works. Be aware not to use Tweak-XP it will attach to your printer files and try to load each time you try to print. A nightmare at best. I do like the features but like others I have 3 other printers on a jetdirect hp and this dosen't work. They have more work to do on this one.
5,Family Favorite,"The videos in this series had a permanent spot on our DVR, back when we still had one. Since we've cut the cord, so to speak, I'm thrilled to find this video for sale. My daughter is 8 and still enjoys watching this and talking about which one was her favorite from when she was ""little"". I like that this series exposes kids to lots of different things. There have been many times when my daughter recognizes a piece of classical music and remembers which cartoon short it was shown with."
4,My twins are enthralled!,"I am a former first grade teacher and educational software designer/developer so I have some experience with educational media. We have all three in the set but this is the only one we have watched so far. I only have one complaint about this and that is the use of the baby voice to introduce each section. It sounds cute but some words are either mispronounced or difficult to understand. I know it's all part of the theme but a ""cleaner"" voice would make it perfect. With that said, I love this as much as my 26 month old twin boys do. It is visually compelling and the musical selections are very nice. I will recommend this to friends."
2,Boring.,"My 12 month old cries when I put it on because it bores him. It doesn't hold his attention. It could be because he is used to DVDs like Brainy Baby, which he LOVES! I was looking for something new for a long car trip. This didn't last long."
4,Cute but only moderately humorous,"This little book is cute, but is not as funny as expected. The drawings were good, but the captions could have been a little more humorous."
2,Cowardly,"The bar is the thieve's guild, and I don't like to play this class. I wanted a paladin character, and now am in 4th edition. The thief is more for younger age groups."
2,A weak sourcebook.,"Compared to some of the other TSR Complete Handbook entries (check out the Bard's book, for example), this one is lackluster. The kits add little besides some description; do we really need an entire sourcebook for this? Buy it only if you're a completist."
5,The Complete Thief's Handbook/Player's Handbook Rules Supple,"If you are a big D&D player who is sick of always being a fighter and wants a chalange. This is the book for you, The thief is a very fun character to play as. I mean who wouldnt want to pick pockets, and loot giant mansions full of treasure and guards without even being touched. keep in mind all of what you have in your supplies and you can loot a house without anybody noticing.if you have any questions on how to loot a house and sneak around email me at magictg00@hotmail.com"
5,Hollyhocks and Radishes cook book,"This is more than just a cookbook! I found the stories to be fascinating and of great interest, being a resident of Northern Michigan myself. The recipes look truly wonderful and I can't wait for my garden to start producing so that I can try the many variations for fresh fruits and vegetables."
3,Hard to stay firmly attached,"I bought this for a friend whose husband had back surgery and they had a small space which did not have room for the arms. This unit attached to the bowl of the toilet, but to hold it together safely, the toilet lid had to be removed. Even so it seemed a little unsteady until he got used to it. There were never any accidents because of it, but he never really felt super safe using this. It did serve its purpose while needed following surgery, however."
1,Poor quality,"I learned to play D&D in 1979 and I've played ever since. I've also painted a few good miniatures in my day. Unfortunately, the folks making these not only can't paint inside the lines, they frequently left parts completely unpainted in my set. Beware of the reviewer from Wisconsin, who makes what sounds like a company-planted pitch and apology by commenting (essentially) ""What can you expect for about $1.25 each?"" I think we can all expect a lot better, frankly. My elven archer didn't even have her bow painted! It was black like the plastic it's made from. When the company's own site shows the figure with a bow painted the color brown, you know someone screwed up. STAY AWAY from these miniature until Wizards of the Coast announced it has improved quality control."

5,IAM A SATISFIED CUSTOMER,IAM A SATISFIED CUSTOMER! Good condition! Great buy! Would do business with this seller again!
1,Disappointed,"The book had the strong odor of cigarette smoke plus the title pages were falling out. Since this book was planned as a gift to someone, I am greatly disappointed."
5,Naming the grief,"I met Mr Smith at a perinatal loss bereavement conference many years ago and have since read many of his books, one of which he signed for me. He has a tremendous understanding of real grief and the gift of being able to share this with effectively with others. He conveys that it is OK to grieve and that grief is a very individual act. Throughout my years as a perinatal loss nurse and now in hospice nursing, I have had many opportunities to share his books with others."
5,El Gran Combo es El Gran Combo!,"Espectacular el sonido del digipack (2008), los coros, la orquesta, las voces.El Gran Combo es el Gran Combo!

1,Don't waste your money$$$,"I bought these mirrors. I hate them. The flexable arm dosen't stay put...the wire has too much memory and ""drift's"" back to it's original position. They also vibrate while you are riding. Spend a few extra bucks and buy bettter mirrors."
2,Flexi bycycle safety mirrors,"They are a great design,but are a little small...they will do the job for now,but next time I'll order a larger size."
1,Don't waste your money,It's a toy for indoor use only. The images in the plastic convex mirror are toosmall to be of any use on the street. Save your money (and possibly your life)and buy a real mirror. I sent mine back for a refund. Ace hardware should beembarassed to sell this mirror.
3,Good Buy for the Money & a Mounting Suggestion,"I discovered a great way to mount this very inexpensive mirror for maximum efficiency: the plastic mounting bracket is flexible enough to mount it on the END of the handlebar, thus turning it into an end-mounted mirror with a GREAT view of the road behind you. You just need to secure it with a twist or zip tie as the bolt provided will no longer work, but that's easy & cheap. So far, after a few rides, it works great, very little vibration, etc. The only drawback: the convex mirror does distort distances quite a bit, but it does provide a very WIDE view of the road. Certainly worth the $4.39."
1,Hard to See Approaching Cars,This mirror was easy to attach and inexpensive however it was useless. I couldn't see approaching cars until they were right behind me!
4,Fish eye lens,"Nice mirror, easy to install and adjust but I'm not crazy 'bout the fish eye glass lens. To each his own."
1,Poor choice,"I didn't expect a lot for the money, but this mirror was worthless. The flexible neck was TOO flexible--wouldn't maintain the position I put it in. Too convex to see anything out of when it WAS adjusted correctly. Very cheap materials--broke quickly, and I was actually a bit relieved when it DID break. It was just wasting space on my handlebar."
1,Wrongly Designed Mirror,"I cannot understand a company like Bell would design such a bad mirror. Its stem is so short that all it displays is your body, and next to nothing to your left. Whichever way I try to adjust it just doesn't it fails to show view left of you. It is like having a small mirror in front of you and expect to see what is behind.Bad purchase. I returned it and bought again just to make sure whether I make any mistake. But no, it is just a badly designed product. I am returning it again."
5,I love it,"Well...it has a lot of characters never before available on the USA systems, as well as never characters from Red Earth a arcade only game in Japan. If you are a fan of 2d classic fighters, this is for you!If you are a new cynical gamer, this is another thing for you to nitpick that isn't as perfect...as you are. :PI love it!"
1,A Game Gear game for my TV? WOW!,"I expected higher quality from CAPCOM and was very disappointed. One of the best features of fighting games is the beautiful detailed artwork. This game seems like they took sprites straight from a game gear game. The horrendous graphics were too distracting to even notice the gameplay, but I bought that game an hour ago and I'm done with it. I just bought the Darkstalkers game for the PS1, thought, so I'm looking forward to that."
3,Something to add to your SF collection,"This game is something to get if you're a Street Fighter fan. This game is missing some stuff, but it's a decent game. Get it only if you like SF games."
2,Missing major characters,No Cammy from Street Fighter and no Morrigan from Darkstalkers. How lame! Plus Bison doesn't do his slide kick anymore. Maybe Playstation should just come out with seperate collections of each fighting game with every character they ever had.
1,bad game,"unfortunately, this game is not that waiting. bad graphics, slowness and other defects of the game, you are getting bored almost immediately. I do not recommend"
3,Capcom Fighting Evolution,"The game overall is OK. Though by making some points of how it is good and how it is bad will have influences on nmay other opinions.The GOOOD-Shin Akuma-Varied Combo Bars-$20.00THE BAD-Some fighters Lack Combos (ie: wheres Ryu's Shinku Tatsumaki?)-only 21 fighters wow-some super combos ex4ecute a few seconds later after the button commands-Pyron is cheesy and so Is that Mummy Guy (lol)-Where is Ken, Sagat, E. Honda, Blanka, and other Street Fighter Characters?The Controls are balanced they keep the controls from these different capcom games. The Graphics r okay, they could have made the pallette better better and also ADDED some more PPL. the game play is fun.... especially if u USE Shin Akuma!!!4 out of 5 for fun3 out of 5 for overall"
3,It works but . . .,"While this device charges my Sandisk Sansa e260 4 GB mp3 player, it is VERY slow, taking maybe 10 hours to charge it. We ordered 3 of them, so I don't think it's defective, that's just the way it works. It is much faster to charge using your computer, but when you are away from a computer, this device does work (and the price was good for both a wall charger & a car charger.)"
5,Love this aroma,"We have tried many other kinds, this one is the best smelling. Just burn it for alittle while and the whole condo smells clean, fresh and lovely."
4,about the non-caps,Latin doesn't make use of capitals to begin a sentence. A sentence is terminated with a verb and whatever follows that is the beginning of the next sentence. The only thing the author was thinking was to remain true to the language.
4,An excellent translation,"Having studied Latin for seven years, I was very excited about the Latin translation of Philosopher's Stone. The translation is very good, marked only by inconsistant spellings of proper names which should have been picked up by any editor. The style is simple enough that any student with a good base of Latin grammar should be able to translate with the help of a dictionary, as the vocabulary will be in any basic lexicon."
4,Good translation of a modern child's classic,"Although this is great practice for those learning latin, i found some questionable choices in his grammar. I actually prefered it in latin to english for this adds some 'difficulty' in reading a childs book. A lot of fun, i hope more come out."
4,A fine translation,"A solid translation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and fun to read. My one peeve is that typos are if not frequent, noticeably not absent. Still, it's a fine whetstone to sharpen one's command of the language."
3,"Good, but not really necessary","The photos are excellently reproduced, and the text is well written, but if you've already been digging into Hollywood glamour photography, you probably can figure out lighting setups pretty well without diagrams. The diagrams in this book are good for the most part, although the authors left out a few lighting instruments and included a few that probably should have been omitted. They do sort out some rather confusing lighting rather well, though. If you already have Mark Vieira's book ""Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits,"" you probably don't need this book as a technical guide. However, it does have some nice examples of work by other photogs that you may not have seen."
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"Except for the beautiful reproductions of some of the finest Hollywood portraits, the book is a major disappointment. The cover of the book clearly states ""classic shots and how to take them,"" but the authors' feeble attempt at presenting the lighting setups, at least half of which are totally erroneous, is only remotely informative. Christopher Nisperos, a portrait photographer, includes no recreations of any of the images in the book, which is suggestive in itself, and shares no technical information of any substance. There is no discussion of types of lights used by the photographers in any of the discriptions which would have been fascinating and the lighting diagrams suggest working distances for various lights that are at best misleading. All in all the book is a very superficial look at the creation of Hollywood ""style"" portrais and will prove of only very limited value to the aspiring portrait photographer."
4,Could have been better,I find this book interesting and helpful. One thing though that bothers me is that I think it could have been better if they would have tried their own advice and recreated a couple of the photos using their suggested set-ups. They could have then included these photos. The authors offer this book as a guide for others to do that without demonstrating how it worked for them - I think it would have made a good book better.
1,Boring,Thought I would learn something. It was just a lit of names without explanation or insight. You'd have to already have an in depth knowledge of Scottish history to understand it. Waste f money for me:(
3,It was good while it lasted,"I bought this clear case because I liked the color of my phone and I didn't want it hiding behind a case. It was a good product until it broke. While using my phone, it slipped off my hands and landed on a table where I had my arms rested. It wasn't even a hard landing, it was maybe a foot and a half from my hand to the table. The upside about that is it protected my phone."
4,Great ghost story?,"I really enjoyed this book and the question about whether or not this is a ghost story or a psychological story. After I finished reading it, I had to question what actually happened and this spurred to me to look into the debate surrounding this story, which I found more interesting than the book itself. The character development is good and James' writing builds interest throughout. I found the formatting to be good quality for my Kindle."
3,Disappointed in the Ending!,"It was an interesting book but I was sure looking for more in the ending! I kept turning pages, hoping for more. Good writing but the plot was just plain odd."
4,Subtle Terror,"This is a classic that I have heard of but never read. It is written in the old style of many of the classics in a very formal tone. It starts off dark and keeps going that way. You can almost picture the scenes that are described in vivid detail. I'm getting too old to have shivers from scary stories, but I can see how this book might bring shivers to readers. You have to read it slowly to get the full effect and feel the scenes."
1,Confused,"Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand this look right away. It took me several read-overs and the help of sparknotes understand any of this, an I'm still confused."
3,Turn of the Screw,"The Turn of the Screw by Henry James is a wonderful short novel written in the late 1800's Victorian England. It includes many different themes and motifs such as loneliness, human suffering, class, and others. James's style consists of dense sentences, which carry loads of information at once. He does a wonderful job of showing the characters struggles, for example the governess struggles because she has no one to look up to and she is a higher class than all the other characters. James' writing forces the reader to form their own opinions. There is not one answer in the story James lets the reader figure it out themselves. James also sets up the story so that there are no reliable characters. We don't know who we can trust in the book and who we can't. The story definitely makes the reader think twice about the governess and it does not provide an answer to all the problems. The reader has to figure that out themselves."
4,Good Read,The story was interesting and worhtwhile reading.The ending leaves all interpretation to the reader so you don't really know what to think.
2,Difficult reading,"Is it fair to review a book one has not finished? Well, I did not finish it, probably read one-third of the book. It's hard going, long sentences packed with commas, which became so confusing I could not begin to understand them. I understood about 1 in 3 sentences. It felt really good to put this book down.I hope high schools are not assigning this for reading. It would be enough to turn students OFF to reading! Maybe it's available in Cliffs Notes."
1,Sentence construction scarier than the story,"To each his own ... but this style is not for meThis was my first Henry James ... this will be my last Henry James. His writing style got the better of me. The sentences are long with multiple subjects, inserted clauses, excessive wordage. I think I could virtually copy any sentence at random from the book and copy it here to show the repetitive, convoluted, muddy style. I have never minded the old, sometimes clumsy, style of Hardy, Bronte et al, but this was something else! This is wordy and repetitive and often I felt a need to second guess what the sentence was about, let alone the narrative.At times I thought that I was glad that I had seen the movie so that I could make sense of it all, but I feel that the ""unreliable narrator"" is as much in evidence as the ""gothic horror"", giving it a thought provoking ambiguity. Is it haunted? Is she mad? Do I care?"
2,Can't sleep after reading this book,"""Turn of the Screw"" starts out fine, but leaves too much unexplained. I tossed and turned and couldn't sleep after reading it. Hard to know if the governess is hysterical, if the children are being controlled by the spirits or what. The ending is shocking and still leaves too much unanswered."
2,what the hell,"This book was agonizing to read, thank god for the kindle dictionary! Apart from the over use of describing every non consequential detail this book was so ambiguous that I really do not u understand what it was about. I always thought myself as an avid reader with at least a few brain cells but today Henry James you have proven wrong :-)"
3,Lost in translation,"I've read several American books from the same period and never had a problem. This was a challenge. It seemed like I was, at times, reading a different language altogether. I had to stop and reread several parts. Sometimes I was so bewildered after reading and going over parts that I just chucked it up as a loss and went forward. The overall story is very good though. Disturbing imagery and situations compel you to read on. I would have enjoyed this better if I had the cypher to the puzzle of the English language of the 1800's or a little orphan Annie decoder ring!"
4,One of my favorite movies on TV,This story has been one of my favorites since I saw the story on TV in a movie with Deborah Kerr (I believe). I am reading it inbetween my other books and looking for any differences between it and the movie. So far haven't found any. The book is easy to read and I am very glad I have it.
5,Happy,"Love it, my son will be happy. Books books books books books books books books all good and what else can I say."
2,Obscured by prose,"I was always told to read James, but now that I've done so it is clear that I won't have to do so again. The characters were ridiculous, the plot seemed to, at times, be written in code, and though I love a good ghost story I felt that this one fell into the could have been better category."
3,Delia's Book Review,"Even though the author used an old english style of writing, I really enjoyed this book. It would have been better if the wording were not so complicated. After the first few chapters, the story gets to its turning twist. As I then continued to read, I was left at the edge of my seat. Questions were running through my mind and my heart began to speed up. The novel concluded leaving me with my mouth on the ground ."
1,MAY BE TOO AGED FOR SOME READERS.,"I THINK IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ABOUT SPIRITS & FRIGHTENING, BUT LOST ME SOME WHERE. THIS OLD ENGLISH TYPE WRITING IS DEEP FOR SOME PEOPLE."
2,Um....What??,"Knowing that Turn of the Screw helped shape the story for Dark Shadows - the gothic 60's Soap- and being an avid fan, I decided to read this.....I didn't get far. The style of writing in this book is so convoluted that my eyes would read but my brain would quickly trail off trying to throw out the unecessary words and just get to the freaking point of each sentence!! I got the gist of the story but it just took to much mental energy to understand what was being said."
1,Horror without a single scare.,"This is the most bland and boring book I believe I've ever read. The only reason I finished the book was because it was required for one of my college English classes. I was not terrified by any of the passages and through the flowery use of the English language, I realized the only terror was the fact I still had X number of pages to finish. The ""sexual"" tension in this novel was comperable to that of a Disney movie like Mary Poppins or Bambi. The unanswered questions were quickly answered by my own brain saying, ""I don't care"". This book is incredibly boring and I would rather be subjected to 24 hours of Barney and Friends than re-read it."
5,Absolutely haunting,"One hundred years ago the scariest work of horror fiction was written; The Turn of the Screw. Now a century old, this masterpiece is still as creepy and horrific to modern readers as it was to those long ago. Is it a ghost story? A window into the disturbed mind of a nurotic and repressed young woman? A not-so veiled allegory of the abuses, namely sexual, of children? James' rambling, polite, hysterical and prim prose seethes with undertones of violence and aberrant sexuality. After reading this book, you will spend the next week looking over your shoulder; now I understand what ""spine-tingling"" and ""blood-curdling"" mean. This book gave me the shivers, literally."
4,Teaches a life lesson for all,"Although certainly an admirable ""thriller"" and a pretty decent read, there is a lesson in The Turn of the Screw that can be used throughout life: that many times what we see as realities are simply apparations created by our own imaginations. So for all the people who read this book, realize that what James wants all of us to ask ourselves is, ""Are we fooling ourselves?"""
1,a disappointment,"This ""classic"" was a monumental exercise in boredom. I've had more enjoyment whilst pulling slivers out of my fingernails. James takes obtuse to a whole new level with this yarn, one in which he must have gotten paid by the word! Skip to Daisy Miller."
2,Literary Constipation...,"What is there to say about these eighty-seven excruciating pages? They're boring. They're prolix. Most importantly, they aren't SCARY. Not for a second. (You want scary? Try H.P. Lovecraft.) I shudder to think that this is assigned reading in some classrooms...what a way to permeate an ambivalent reader with an aversion to reading.You've been warned..."
2,Classic Crap,"While many regard this as an American masterpiece, I can only say that I found the book so boring I barely made it halfway through. James's characters are silly and his words remain firmly mired in an outdated style filled with so many appositives it's hard to figure out exactly what his sentences are supposed to mean. So little is actually said that the reader can only grasp the overall tone and feel without ever quite attaining a sense of individual events. It's too frustrating to make this book an enjoyable read, and I can only think that this book has outlived its welcome on the modern list of classics. It's not completely horrid, though; the style does accurately give a sense of setting, but only in the broadest sense, and it's not enough."
1,Turn of the Screw,I will only purchase books from the bookstores from now on. The print was small and the book wasThe Turn of the Screw (Tor Classics)what I would consider poor quality.
4,Great salsa from a great band (i.e. combo),"Great selection of hits from their very long recording careers.It is a very good collection to start with for those folks that like Salsa and/or El Gran Combo. For folks that are big fans of El Gran Combo this would be a stop-gap until you get all the great individual albums (e.g Aqui no se sienta nadie, Universidad de la Salsa, Happy Days, Nuestro Anniversario, En Las Vegas, etc.).Highly Recommended!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was Leary of ordering this DVD after some of the reviews. I wasn't expecting to like it really and I love it! I disagree with the reviews that say it was hard to determine the beginning/end of an interval. Even though the instructions could stand to be a little clearer, in no way does it interfere with your workout. The instructor does do a lot of unnecessary talking, but overall a great workout. Definitley glad I bought it."
3,Pretty good,"Bought this for my hubby that does triathlons to train in the winter. He says they are good workouts, especially for those tht need motivation. But he prefers just riding while watching tv so unfortunately, this will not be for him."
2,Boring,I enjoy spinning at the gym. For me this DVD was very boring. I have yet to even finish the full DVD because I just couldn't take it anymore.
1,boooooooooooooooring!,"What a snooze. Yes, I sweated a lot but my goodness this was the most boring cycling class I ever took. I need more than 10 minutes of plain cycling in between phases. Definitely wouldnt suggest this unless you just want to pedal with a some challenge every 10 minutes."
2,Weak,"There is more warm up / recovery / cool down in this workout than there is actual workout. If you've ever taken a spinning class from even an average instructor, you'll find this to be pretty soft."
3,video,great video my mom likes it i guess idk so i guess im happy i guess everyone else should buy this
1,Horrible!,"I don't review much on Amazon but I am compelled to for this one. First off, there is only one 55 minute workout on this dvd, which is surprising. Second, the instructor is incredibly annoying. Most spin instructors are, but this guy takes the cake. All he does is talk, there really is very little working out on this DVD. He prepares you for two 10 minute intervals by talking about them each for 20 minutes. The music is in no way synced up to the intervals, so you feel like something is not quite right as you're pushing yourself. Then, the dude stops pedaling right in the middle of the last push to talk more! I have had instructors that were pregnant that never stopped. You're supposed to keep going no matter what! Overall I am incredibly disappointed, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,Good ride,"Enjoy the ride and the challenge of this DVD. I do have to agree with some folks that there is a lot of talking during the ride. I do know that it is to the benefit of the ""athlete,"" but I would enjoy less talking from the instructor."
4,Great workout,I've taken spinning classed in the gym and was not sure how I would keep myself motivated to work at the high intensity I liked in the gym classes at home. I was nicely surprised to find this DVD pushed me to work hard and kept me motivated.
1,"Spinning: Crank it up, but shut up","I read the reviews on this DVD and thought it would be a great addition. I barely got thru the first 10 minutes. Josh Taylor is way too chatty. I was looking for a workout, not a therapy session. I suppose if I have never worked out on a spin bike, all of his pointers/suggestions/instruction would have been helpful, but too much talking, not enough pedaling. I will try again to get thru the beginning, but what bothers me the most is that if I did end up liking the workout, I will always have to listen or fastforward thru the first part. All of that info, should have been placed in an instructional area (which there is one) or on another disc. It was a big mistake to include all that talking in the main workout."
1,No menu!,"This DVD has no menu! As an artist and an art teacher, I purchased it with a genuine interest in enjoying by video the techniques of the Old Masters. The first section starts out with the very basics in shapes and shadows. The artist then moves on to figure drawing. If I want to review a section at a time, the only way to do it is to start at the beginning and fast forward until I hopefully arrive near where I want to be. It is also distracting to see the artist's arm come in front of the camera, plus he rambles. His drawings are well presented, but the video is poorly created."
1,Not Compatible with Palm Vx PDA,I purchased this product thinking it would be compatible with my Palm Vx PDA. It was not. I did not find the product specifications section detailed enough to be able to tell this in advance of my order.
5,Best massage therapist music ever,"I recently bought 2 CDs. At a recent therapist convention in Vegas. It has been all I play since. My clients love it and I can focus on treatment while enjoying some wonderful melodic tones of this duo. Mountain in the Sky and Heartscape are fantastic. I would recommend this music for meditation, relaxation, and for massage therapy sessions! best!"
4,Great book,This book is wonderful for the ages I teach (3 -5 yr olds).The words are simple and explain about his life in a very easy way.I was glad to find a book like this after looking for a long time.
3,Slides off my face,"The powder goes on nicely, but I have very oily skin and within an hour or two my face was shiny again! I wouldn't recommend for oily complexions--need something with more staying power!"
3,el producto es bueno,"the product is good and I love the products of this brand, but the price they charge for the office is very high, 50% of the value of the product, therefore, not recommended."
4,Clinique Clinique Superpowder Double Face Powder,covers beautifully looks like clean skin and is so light it does not feel like you are wearing anything at all.
3,Color,"The color of the powder is not the same that was shown in the profile, the color is not beige, is more white than beige.The item came well packed."
5,Clinique clinique superpowder,"I'm very satisfied with the product, it is excellent and arrived at the appointed time and in perfect conditions. Thanks!"
5,Excelente Prducto,Satisfecha con la compra. El vendedor muy responsable. El polvo es muy bueno. El producto me llego en buenas condiciones. Saludos desde Venezuela!
4,BUEN PRODUCTO,"EXCELENTE, YO SUFRO DE ALERGIA EN A CARA Y SOLO CON ESTE PRODUCTO HE ENCONTRADO MEJORIA. LA PUNTUALIDAD EN A ENTREGA EXCELENTE... EMPRESA RESPONSABLE... MUCHAS GRACIAS"
1,Disappointed in the water balloon sling,The sling broke within the first few launches. It broke and snapped one of my children. He had a bad welt for a few days. It was a big disappoinment. My guys were really excited about using this sling over vacation.
3,Mixed reactions.,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"", as a movie, missed out on some great songs, and so did its soundtrack. While some of its songs are worthwhile, like So Cal Loco, they missed the Good Charlotte song ""Little Things"", and the Freestylers song ""Here we go."" Those two just begged to be on the track list, as well as a bunch of others. My advice to anybody who has a copy of DWMC is to watch the credits again, write down all of the music credits, and download them online, 'cause there are at least 5 great singles that didn't get featured on the soundtrack."
5,the best,"this was one of the few soundtracks that outdid the movie. dont get me wrong, the movie was good, but the soundtrack is way better even though they did leave off GOOD CHARLOTTE'S ""Little Things"" but ive got that cd, which is great too. ....Punk is the best!!!"
2,"dude, wheres the music?","where is good charlotte? that was the only song i noticed in the movie, and its such an awesome song. just buy the good charlotte cd...and the superdrag."
2,Someone may be able to help?,Does any 1 know the name and artist of the song they play when Chester and Jesse are in the next to the guy and the girl in the white identical car? i cant figure out what it is someone E-mail me the answer plz!
4,Music,"I noticed a lot of people are looking for songs that aren't on the soundtrack. Go <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0242423/soundtrack"">here</a> for a full listing of songs from the movie. That should help most of you."
5,"I too would like to know what song is ""the bubble buns""?","I've been trying to figure out the name of the song when they are dressed in bubble wrap and the song starts going ""the bubble buns"" or something like that. I have scoured the net and can't find jack. Does anyone know. If so email me at krawler72@juno.com"
1,DO NOT BUY ANY STICKS EVER ONLINE!,"DON'T DO IT PEOPLE, DON'T BUY THESE STICKS! Find a local music store, and buy them their. They look cool online, but you get them and then they're 2 inches wide instead of 1/2 inch. And, they're all splintery and broken because of the cruddy packaging and mail service. So go to your local music store, or look one up in the yellow pages, and go there. They've usually got a whole rack on the back wall of sticks, so use that to test them out. Thank you and have a nice day."
3,Dont bother ...,"I was very excited about this game. I am fan of WW2 games and this game for a change has Germans and Allies as opposed to Red vs Blue. However, the game introduces Robed figures and unrealistic super weapons. I could have lived with it if the game played well but it does not.In a mix or real time and turn based but is a wrong mix. On a map strategic level you are in turn based mode - and that lasts a long time while you fumble around looking for enemy. Then its real time but there is no real control beyond choosing targets and trying to maneuver. The units are very unbalanced, with pt boats easily taking out aircraft carriers, which in turn have to close in to fight as battleships! It's a mess. Graphics are not bad, but there no voiceovers, the story is ridiculous. I would skip this one"
4,over all,this game is alot of fun lots of stradgy involde. the charicters should have voices. the damage to the ships is a little lame should have parts of the ship brake off.good for younger people nice grafics the ships should have been historical.but for me its a nice game for long car trips
5,Genetic research replaces Cold War in this thriller.,"Set in modern-day Siberia, this thriller follows Johnny Porter, a multilingual Canadian scholar, as he first masterfully (and illegally) enters Siberia to obtain a secret discovery from a former colleague at a secret Siberian research facility (very difficult to get to) and then tries to get back to America after being discovered. Davidson's novel is relentlessly suspenseful, thrilling and tense and the surprise ending will amaze and delight"
5,Great!,"I loved this book despite being warned not to read it as it was ""too heavy"". It was an absolute delight ... the characters good, the story different and exciting. Even better than James Bond! I found this book unputdownable, and loved the unpredictable, unusual ending. I will cetainly be reading more of Lionel Davidson."
3,Did I read the same book?,"After reading the other customer review, I had to ask myself ""Did I read the same book?"" Entertaining? Definitely. A classic thriller? Definitely not. First, I couldn't get past the entire premise that Johnny Porter, a loner from the Canadian wilderness, just happens to have espionage skill that would put James Bond to shame. More significantly, however, I left the table hungry after finishing to book. After patiently waiting for something to happen as we toured Siberia for the better part of the book, everything was wrapped up quickly, leaving me to wonder what it was all for. Do not get me wrong. I enjoyed this book. I just do not understand what all the fuss was about as it was no more notable than most other books I have read."
3,a reasonbly entertaining read,"I bought this based on the brothersjudd review below. It was good, and it was a page turner, but I kept waiting for something to happen, and it kind of didn't. The big secret wasn't really super exciting, nor were the individual elements. It would be good airplane reading, however it's not the intellectual thriller that I would have liked. I'd look carefully before I bought another of Davidson's books, but it's not out of the question."
2,What is the sound of a yawn? (Insert here),"This story didn't work very well for me. It was excrutiatingly slow getting out of the blocks, became mildly interesting about one third of the way along, and then bogged down again. Then, it seemed the author decided to insert a most-unlikely love angle, after which, one fortuitious happenstance after another occur. Then we are treated to the bumblingly inefficient Russian army (how convenient), and an overused, transparent ruse at the end. This is very tedious reading of the sort that makes a reader want to demand a refund, not so much, of their money, but rather of their time. Imagine this: A Russian officer referring to a military blunder as, ""a cockup""! How much more British could that dialog be, for Christ's sake!"
1,Bottom one per cent,"I don't ask much from my novels. I do, though, ask that there be at least a hint of characterization in the hero - in this novel, however, said spy is scraped off the pages of a bad A-Team episode script, and thrown into a supposed thriller with any number of minor characters who might also have fallen out of a really bad 1980s soap. There should be a new genre for this author. Not thriller, but snorer. If you want something to read, try paying your seven-year-old daughter to write you something instead. You'll enjoy it more."
1,"No heart, no feelings. No wonder he can't be killed.","This is quite possibly the lamest book I have ever read in the cold-war thriller genre. Implausible plot devices, impossible heroics (the shot ""leaves his eye on the floor,"" yet our stalwart hero trudges on at one point), and a prose style that makes two week old lasagna seem fresh.No motivation is ever developed for a rude and reticent lead character (with the prerequisite pot boiler characteristics of hyper-academic intelligence, animalistic backwoods savvy, inexhaustible macgyver-like creativity and, oh yes, an irresistible charm to women to abandon his mountain man idyll and become siberia's own Rambo, save for the notion that a 5 page book about a hero who tells the authorities to get lost may not have made the most ordinary of books.As this is, and oh that it had been released in the five page version."
4,Loved by our five year old!,"We received this as a gift and after a somewhat rocky start (Hard to figure out what is going on and instructions are a little vague) we loved it. Our five year old daughter plays it constantly and loves to try to figure out how to solve the case. It is different every time you play, so even if you are able to solve it (we haven't yet) it's a new game each time. A great game...we are giving it as gifts to every computer kid we know!"
5,One Year Later,"My son received this game as a gift on his fourth bithday, and still plays it on a regular basis! That's more than I can say for any toy or game he has ever owned. The ever-changing scenerios within the game keep it fresh and new every time he plays. I am still amazed that such a long and involved game can keep his attention for so long, and for so many times over. I credit that to the excellent animation, music, plot, and over-all challenge of the game. Although he has solved the mystery dozens of times over he still gets excited every time he does it again."
2,best computer game in our house,"This is the best computer game in our house....and the most played! My 4 year old playes it over and over. She loves the characters, the music, and hunting for the clues. She doesn't get bored with it because it changes every time she playes it, and it really makes her think. This game was definitely worth the money!"
3,Replacing a lost disc,"I used to have this one cassette years ago, and hearing it again was like running into an old friend."
5,Excellent mix of everything - all your needs get met...,"This CD is excellent. It's a soulful mix of jazz, hip hop, and R&B. Kajmere is a distribution company on the west coast turning out indiesoul, hip hop, dance, and indierock. They typically turn out 12"" releases - most of these cuts are from these releases. And, this is exactly how this music sounds to me - underground, like hidden treasure - each track. From Adriana Evans' ""Remember the Love"", to N8E's ""Tread Lightly"" and ""Rock On"", to all of DJ Tonks' tracks, to Presto and LOWD's ""Back in 92"", to ""Love"" by the Globetroddas, this CD is an outstanding soulful representation of where I hope music continues to go. Buy it - you won't be disappointed."
2,"Good story, but too damn long.",That's about it. Steinbeck could have cranked this story out in about twenty pages. It's just too loooooooooong for what you get out of it.
4,It's a textbook,I'f you're buying this you probably need it for a class (I wouldn't have otherwise) and for that purpose it is great. I know that an author's words are just their views and opinions on topic but at times I felt like a lot of that personal opinion was injected into his ideas. Overall the information is good but at times it felt somewhat more aligned with Holpp's personal views.
5,Randy Wood,"I am a non-Native American who lives on a Lakota reservation. The local radio station plays Randy Wood's music a lot, and he has become one of my favorite Native American artists. His voice is beautiful. Being of Cree nationality, his songs are much slower and softer than the traditional Lakota songs, but they retain a universal Native style. My favorite song by far is ""Our Love Will Never Die."""
4,Loved it! One of her best.,"I have read all of Ms. Krantz' books except for Spring Collection, which for some reason I could not 'get into'. I'll Take Manhattan is one of my faves of hers. I highly recommend it -- I also recommend viewing the miniseries (they show it on the Romance Network quite frequently)...very well done and, for the most part, true to the book."
2,Not bad.... but...,"I heard so much about Judith Krantz work, that I thought I'd give it a try with this novel. Although I feel her writing is very well, I did not feel a desperation for Maxi's (main character) success in saving her father's magazine business. Maxi is a spoiled girl, that will be worth millions whether or not she saves the magazine or not. The only desire she has to save the business, is to continue her father's legacy - but even that doesn't seem urgent. However, it seems from the story that her father put his business well above his children. To me, I believe the story was shallow and none of the characters were worthy enough for me to feel emotions on their success or failure. Quite a bore for me, but well written."
4,Fresh/broad vision,The book helped me to put some commonsense about the Internet/technology and their impacts together. But it lacks of depth.
5,excellent will continue to use amazon reliable thanks,as ever great delivery recommend to any body very good will use again
2,Turning into a propaganda show justifying torture,"This show started out interesting but it looks more and more like something Karl Rove has commissioned to drum up public support for draconian government forces - we NEED them for our protection! - that torture and destroy civil liberties left and right. I hope to God that in a few years shows like this and ""24"" are seens as shameful relics of a dark time in our history - an aberration that won't be repeated. What a pity that this show did not live up to its original promise."
4,Not the Best Season,"I'm a fan of the series, but I have to say that the 3rd season is really boring. The show really needs to get back to focusing on the future plot again instead of these side stories. Some good episodes and some episodes where I felt like nothing really happened and the series story barely moved. I don't have cable, so I'm hoping season 4 really brings it back."
5,4400 Season 3,"I bought this item because I couldn't see this season on cable tv because itinterfered with another program. Since I did see it until season 2, I decided tobuy it. I was right! Season three is the most exciting and interesting seasonof all 4400 seasons. If I can't see the next season again, I am sure to buyseason four!"
5,iNetVideo,I had purchased a new copy of the video and to my surprise the 2nd video was not in the case. iNetVideo sent me a new case within days with no questions asked. Thanks iNetVideo
5,4400 season 3,The dvds arrived quickly and were in perfect condition. I watched all the episodes in a few days. Awesome.
4,4400 Never fails to deliver the goods!,"This season was very much one giant story from beginning to end, a story which delivered more often then not. This season wasn't as engaging as the previous seasons but I think that is just because of the way it was laid out to introduce something bigger and season 4 should be quite the hoot, continuing (at least in the beginning of the season) where this one left off. If you are a 4400 fan (and why wouldn't you be?!) you should definitely pick this up. If you are new to the 4400, you should of course start from the beginning."
5,The future in question ?????,"This is one series that doesn't take us too far out yet let's us enjoy what the future ""might"" be. For those of us that enjoy sci-fi/fantasy, this show doesn't take us so far out that we can use our imagination to fill in the blanks till the next installment."
3,good but not great,"I loved seasons 1 and 2. However, season 3 just didn't seems as good to me. Don't get me wrong, I love the show.....I just hope season 4 is as good as the first two seasons."
1,Gawd awful.,"1. Many, many, many typos. 2. The downloadable errata data covers about half the errors. 3. Most of the errors are in the 1st few chapters. 4. Experienced Access programmers find many of the explanations confusing. Beginners find them incomprehensible. 5. I know of no other book that covers the same material. 6. Uff da."
2,"Yeah, it's a disaster, but ...","Obviously this book has problems. Even beyond the gigantic list of errors at their web site I was still able to find about 40 more significant errors, (OK here comes the however) HOWEVER, It looked like Dulaney and company did a fairly good job of writing the text and then somewhere along the production line things fell to pieces.The style of writing is quite reasonable, and the topics covered cut right to the information tested on the exam. If you take about an hour with a bottle of white-out , a red pen, and a listing of the errors, you can turn this book into a fairly decent study tool. YES I KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT, but hey, with the scarcity of titles out there there are not many alternatives. I will be glad to share additional corrections that I have found with all who ask."
1,Too Many Errors,This book was riddled with typos and errors. They forgot to put the practice labs on the CD! I constantly had to go back to Microsoft documentation for clarification. Publisher sent me a 12 page error and correction list for this book.
1,Does the publisher read these reviews!,"As I said before, don't buy it. Spend the bucks and get the Transcender practice tests. I wouldnt buy another prep guide from this publisher."
1,The typos and blatent logical errors make this book useless.,"This book is rife with typos, logical errors, contradictions and completely false statements. I have never read a book with so many errors. Reading this book was a very aggravating experience because I had to second guess virtually every statement. This meant that I couldn't just read something and take it as fact. Instead, I had to verify it by either running the code in Access or looking up the topic in the Access help files. This book is so bad that I fully intend to write a letter to the publisher to complain. Further, I had to postpone my exam and have ordered some expensive test prep software to use as a study tool instead. This book simply doesn't cut it."
3,A good book for the exam.,"Yes there are many, many errors and you can't believe what the authors say. However, if you read the preface it states there are errors. In studying for the exam, LEARN THE CONCEPTS, don't memorize the book. Compare what the author's have written vs. the actual help files in Access. Then you will have true confidence when exam time comes. I have just passed the exam and will provide one huge hint. When you get up in morning, open a recordset. When you go to work open a recordset. etc. etc. Open recordsets in every conceivable situation and every conceivable way and understand what the recordset does. And study your eyeballs out!"
3,"Poorly-written, but will help you pass the exam","This is one of the most poorly written books that I have seen (and there are a lot of them in our industry). However, if you want to pass the exam, it is an excellent study guide. If you can overlook the large number of typos and errors (most of which are NOT covered in the errata sheet on the internet), this book will help you pass the Access exam. However, if you want to actually LEARN how to program in Access, I recommend Wrox's Beginning Access 97 VBA Programming."
3,Good book for the MCSD exam.,"If you have decent hands-on programming experience with VBA, DAO, and SQL this book combined with the Transcender Exams would be good bets to pass the Access Cert exam.If you don't have any programming experience in Access but are an advanced Access user I would highly recommend using the Access95 or Access97 Visual Basic Step By Step book by Microsoft Press before going into this book and the Transcenders."
2,A Fair Book to start with but not enough,"I passed the exam with 824. This book is a big Cliff's Notes type of summary of major concepts. The CD Sucks! The Exam engine on the CD uses what looks like a V Fox Pro file, too. This book is not enough. Don't pay retail. Advice: To pass the exam, STUDY the ""Mastering Access Programming"" and the excellent ""Building Applications"" both on the same CD by MS. ThIS CD and Transcender will gaurantee passing the exam"
2,Had potential but was so unprofessional.,"When I first received the book I thought I had struck gold - Hardcover, well laid out with excellent topics and lots of review questions. But there are so many errors it is just a joke. Not one of the authors is even an MCSD. Maybe good for a laugh or as a book end. Hopefully the next edition will be something useful."
2,Terrible book. Stay away from it.,"We are all used to confusing, inaccurate computer books. However, when it comes to certification books I think we deserve something better. The publisher should be ashamed and Microsoft should be ashamed for approving it. I'll never buy another New Riders book."
3,Comprehensive but too many typos and technical errors,"The book definately helped me prepare for the exam, however the typographical and just plain incorrect answers for some of the review quizzes were a drag. I also found the CD to be of limited value - missing lab exercises and the test prep was not so great. I found the book to be fairly comprehensive. What other books are there for the Access test?"
1,An Embarrassment,"Flat out, hands down the worst computer book I have ever read.It is so full of errors that before you are through with 2 chapters you stop trusting what the authors are telling you.Don't buy it."
1,Quite Disappointed: But Passed!!!,The lab exercises they mentioned on the CD were never to be found. The Exam engine has full of repetitions in the practice exams (one question repeats 20 times). In some cases the answers are wrong. For some one who is not so familiar with Access - This book is not accurate enough to learn and pass the exam.
2,Weak Review Questions but it helped me pass!,"I had little experience with Access or any other DB but this book helped me pass! Most of the errors I noticed were in the review questions. Nevertheless between this book, practice exams, and 6 weeks of study I PASSED!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Many errors, but the only book that covers 70-609 objectives","If you need a resource that outlines the MS 70-609 objectives, the MCSD Access Training Guide is about the only resource out there (besides Transcender) that covers the objectives as they are outlined on the actual MS exam. Go to the bookstore, copy down the Table of Contents, then study those objectives on your own with Access and Visual Basic help files. As others have said, the book is rife with errors, but it did give me a sense of what to expect on the exam. The recordsets chapter (Ch. 4) was a helpful introduction and fairly accurate (I think!!!!)"
2,So many technical errors and Microsoft approved this book?,"The book's front cover has the official Microsoft Certified Professional - Approved Study Guide logo. Obviously, Microsoft just approved the cover and not the book's content. A quick review of the contents revealed too many typographical and technical errors. I downloaded the errata and unzipped the files - an .rtf file containing textual fixes and .mdb files for the Lab exercises. But the errata only covers about two-thirds of the problems! I find it very difficult reading a section in the book and cross referencing the errata document against the book. Overall, the book is structured according to the MCSD prep guide. It is the only book that covers the #70-69 exam that I have found. The book would be a great asset if it was proofread BEFORE it was printed. Could someone at New Riders publishing please hire a bonafide proofreader!"
3,Pretty good but too many mistakes,"It seems that everyone notices that there are a lot of typing mistakes. There are logic mistakes and some wrong answers listed. When the correct answer should be ""A"" sometimes the answer key may list it as ""B"". If you are an inexperienced user, it may confuse you and cause wrong answers on the acutal test."
4,"Comprehensive, easy-to-read, but full of printing errors","It is obvious when you go through this text that there was no proof-reading before this book was shipped. It has many typos and printing errors (some of which make the practice exam questions inaccurate). Despite that, it is comprehensive and easy to read. There is not much else available for exam 70-69!"
1,Admitted to child sexual abuse,"This priest admitted to child sexual abuse. Please realize that he is a liar. What he has written sounds so good, but you cannot trust the words he has written. It is so sad that he used his gift to lure children into his awful life."
2,Inconsistent,"After telling us that ""loving yourself"" is the key to happiness, the author then tells us that ""we can not make it alone......I need to see my worth and beauty reflected in your eyes."" p.24. This puts people right back where they were, addicted to others. Sure, human beings fundamentally need other people, but only after becoming secure without them."
3,You can buy this new for less!,"You can buy this product new for $40 from Sunburst Media. Why pay more for a used copy when you can buy it new for almost half the price?I agree with the other reviewer who said it is best for certain behaviors. But it also encourages positive reinforcement, which some parents need help with."
2,Good ideas poorly executed book,"There are several very good ideas buried in this poorly written book. There are also good quotes starting each chapter. As other reviewers have pointed out, the author wanders off on screeds that are not well supported or in all cases topical."
2,"nice philosophy, poor supportive arguments","Really disappointing book. This book would never persuade me to try voluntary simplicity (luckily I already came to it from other sources). Even though I wholeheartedly agree with many of Andrews' points, the book offers little support for her sweeping generalizations. Does she really believe that the clinically depressed could snap out of it by shopping at locally owned boutiques instead of the faceless mall? The entire book seems unfinished, full of author's notes and opinions but with few facts or well-constructed arguments. Where was her editor?"
1,Disappointed,"I picked up this book after reading about it on the Simple Living network, which I found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and their work ""Your Money or Your Life"". Unlike Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living, Ms. Andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism. After reading Dominguez, this book is disjointed, preachy and quite frankly, bad. That's not so say that Ms. Andrews doesn't have some good ideas. She does, but as with so many anecdotal books, they're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way. If you live an environmentally sensitive life, Ms. Andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself, but if your goal is to simplify your life, you could do better than spending time on this book."
3,pobre calidad de sonido,"Manzanero y sus canciones son excelentes pero la calidad del sonido de este disco deja mucho que decir, siendo yo bien exigente en cuanto a musica y calidad de audio, no esta mal pero pudo quedar mejor, la edad o epoca de las grabaciones no tiene nada que ver con esto, existen grabaciones de artistas mucho mas viejas con excelente calidad."
2,Not what I thought,It is very thin and flimsy. Feels like it's made from tin foil. Doesn't fit in my hood vent even though it claims to be the proper one.
5,vent filter fits!,I've had trouble finding this locally and was surprised how easy it was to order. the product is top of the line quality. fits perfectly
1,Discontinued and No Win 7 Support,"Bought it 2 years ago... still functions; but it will not support Windows 7...Support from Insignia... ZERO... thumbs down...Overall it's not the best choice of MP3 players and I'm regretting my purchase...I don't recommend buying off-brand hardware any more...I don't like the idea of buying an Apple product; but for MP3s and Audio Books, I guess I don't have a choice...If anyone wants my Insignia... drop me a note and we'll talk about a trade... but only get it if you are on Windows XP and don't plan on changing that any time soon.-"
3,Liked it out of the box,"A pretty neat little player. Carried it in a fanny pack with my TILT smart phone and on the 3rd day the display was non functional. Only 1/4 of the right side of the display works which renders it a MP3 player with no way to change modes or functions. Smart phone survives, Insignia doesn't and it shows no marks to indicate the display got hit in any way. Loved it for a couple of days. AMAZON was great as usual."
4,Great Value!,"I bought an 8 GB model used on eBay. Works great - better than average sound quality. I originally bought it for music but because Windows Media Player (WMP implementation in Vista leaves a lot to be desired) somehow glitched during one sync, it added all my video files to the Insignia player without my knowledge. It turned out they looked great when played back on the device - they played smoothly with very good sound and very crisp resolution. I had about thirty video files of one to five minutes each plus my 1800 songs and the player still had two GB's left.Functions as a normal storage drive also.Great battery life.Moderately easy to use.I have dropped this thing several times and sat on it a few times and, so far, it has survived."
4,Wow! So beautiful...you almost hate to blow it up.,"This is a great game! A little lacking on story, but what do you care? You've got aliens to kill, and some exotic weapons to do it with! All that's missing is the ability to kick down the doors, instead of waiting for them to open...."
3,OK,"First, this dvd is missing two tracks from the list on the back, one Dusty Springfeild and one Brooke Shields track. These are excerpts from the Tom Jones Variety Show. I enjoyed watching it both historically and as entertainment, having recently discovered TJ. The only thing that perturbed me slightly was that it wasn't remastered. Can't we remaster everything? Why bother transfering it to dvd, if you're not going to clean it up? I could have saved $$ buying a tape. Other than that, the dvd entertains. GO TJ!"
3,Not Their Best,"Mariachi Vargas is one of the best known mariachi bands. I've lived in Mexico and heard a lot of Mexican music such as mariachi and rancheros. Some tracks on this album have too much non-Mexican background enhancements. There are, however, some good tracks, Guadalajara being one example. All in all worth the price."
3,have not used yet,I heard really good things about this product but i have not used mine yet. I gave it 3 stars because i bought it due to other reviews. Plus delivery time was very good
1,Messy!,"This mascara is extremely wet, and I find it to be very messy. I have deep set eyes and and this mascara gets all over my eye lids."
2,Still Searching,"This mascara was dry and clumpy. Also, when you look down, it smudges. I will continue searching for a mascara for length and smudge proof."
3,Good documentary but short on music and one nit-pic.,"""Never-before-seen film of Joan as a teenager performing at Club 47 in Cambridge-"" I take issue with that. I was often there when when Joan sang. There is a still photo in the DVD of the actual 'Club 47' scene in the DVD. Compare that photo to the movie scene and the movie looks like it is after-the-fact staged, something like a scene in a Bill Healey and his Comets 'Rock Around theClock' movie, nothing like the actual set-up at the real Club 47. P.S. Joan would often break into a rock-N-roll song in about every other set in those early days, something that was missing from the few of her more recent concerts I have been to."
3,Joan Baez Nostalgia,"Back around the time when I was in the 6th or 7th grade, decades ago, I considered Joan Baez to be the ideal of feminine beauty. The picture on the front of this DVD package reminded me that I was right.This DVD shows that it's more than skin deep.And, she can sing!There's not much about the music here, it's mostly politics. Her musical development is hardly mentioned, but I enjoyed watching it."
2,disappointed,disappointed with the music. not as calming and enjoyable to listen to as thought. would not really recommend this cd to others
1,What a pity,"What a pity to have collected so wonderful pieces of music of this legend singer, and to permanently cover her music with plenty of verbiage without interest, with a few exceptions of some short films and part of Joan herself interview.Why not to have a separate track for only the music band - that you would like to enjoy many times - and one for the comments and interview - that you will listen to only once (maximum)? instead of this frustating mix."
3,ALBUM CONTENT,I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED JOANS MUSIC. I AM CONFUSED AS TO WHY AMAZON DOES NOT LIST THE SONGS IN THE ALBUM???
5,Wonderful story of real spirit of Christmas,"When grandmother was a little girl, her people, the Quechan of SE California and W Arizona, become tired of soldiers interfering in their land and plan an attack for Christmas day. Grandmother finds a way to prevent the battle when she sees a soldier who rescued her when she was lost in the desert."
5,We back baby!!!,"We back!!! Yo, This the one and only OmegaRed Of X-Caliber Productions. Just a little Something for yall Clubheads to know ,my man Quick Aint no joke. The hot boy Vol.1 is one of the hottest cd's out this year. Check it out. See in B-more a.k.a. HARM-CityOmegared of X-Caliber ProductionsLook For X-Caliber in the 2000"
5,Harmony liked this one so she ordered this,I let my 2 year old at the time play games on my kindle fire. She was playing one of her games. I didn't see what she was doing she got on the Amazon store app. I had been looking at the Elmo DVD's I guess she liked the looks of the movie so she clicked on it. I had my account set for the 1-click and she bought the movie.
4,HIghly rated,"I highly recommend this video. We purchased it for the children because they were home from daycare over the summer. I try to stock up on educational videos while they are at home. It has been viewed over and over again by my 22month old and my 3 1/2 year old. They even watch it in the minivan. My daughter loves to sing the ABC song and my sons likes ""I have a new way to walk, walk....> Its ringing in my head. Enjoy."
2,BEST OF ELMO 2,"I was expecting something similar to Best of Elmo 1 but this was mostly Elmo's World and the annoying characters in that section of the Sesame Street program. Even though my grandchild loves most of Sesame Street's DVDs and the program, he does not like me to put this one on. I think Sesame Street should stop emphasizing Elmo so much and go back to its roots, where everyone on the street would participate equally. Thanks."
4,Our 1st Elmo DVD,"We got this after reading all reviews from other customers, and our little one loves it! He don;t mind watching it again and again for our long-drive weekends! The Robot theme is very enriching and with Elmo, its a total hit for him. There's a couple of songs he isn't really into it, but he didnt whine about it either."
3,Great clips but scary robot,"When we put this video on for our son, we were surprised by the immediate crying. The robot in the video scared him. He was able to get through the video while forwarding through the parts where the robot speaks, but he hasn't watched it since."
5,best gift for my toddler,I just love this video with such great quality and my toddler loves the music and is now more than ever in Love with Elmo. So many personalities that gatherered to make this my favorite Sesame Street video. You will love the themes and the meaning of friendship with Elmo and the Robot.
3,an 11 year old softwear user,"I don't have this game but I know someone who does. This game is so cool.It has deer calls , guns and sents and all that. I really recommend you get this.But if you like to hunt bighorn sheep,black bears,caribou and deer ( 3 different species ) I strongly recommend CABELA'S BIG GAME HUNTER 3.It has 14 rifles, 2 shotguns, 2 handguns, 3 muzzleloaders, and 4 bows and even a hunter safety course !"
3,you shoot deer,"What, do you think the point of the game is to walk around the woods shooting FLAMINGOS? That wouldn't be much of a challenge.Deer Hunter II is another one of those Christmas gifts that never got much attention. In that respect, Deer Hunter II is like fruitcake. Well maybe not, but it sure is fruity. The code where you can run so fast you actually CATCH UP to the deer is hilarious. You can run up to them, glance over to your right, see the deer running beside you, and shoot them that way!If you want to play the game normally, you have to sit patiently and wait for the deer to quietly come out of nowhere. It can take a while, just like real hunting. When they're close enough for you to aim your gun and get a clear shot, TAKE THE SHOT!Provides a little bit of fun. I'm sort of disappointed you can't shoot your own truck, though (it's sitting in the woods- look for it)."
5,Great game,I purchased this back in 1998 and of all the deer hunter games I liked this one the best. You don't need to have the disc in the computer to play it.I hunt deer in the real life and find this to be a easy way to capture that hunter realisiam. This disc came fast and worked flawlessly. I highly recomend this game to anyone who likes deer hunting
2,Whats The Point To The Game,Hey This game SUCKS!!!! What the Hell Is the point To the game to shoot Deer Wow very amazing There is no Compitions so its stooppiiddd The stupid deer are very unrealistic i can get right up next to it and it just looks at me it finally runs after I take my gun out then it runs 10 feet and I just blow its brains out plleeeeeeassssssseeeeeeee get the game becuse its Sucks but its still kinda fun
5,Dang good stuff!!!!,".. like the previous reviewer, great vocals & musicianship. Very creative melodies. I expect these guys to be very popular."
2,Didn't particularly like it.,"I'll have to admit, 'I was There' told a good story. I've always wondered about the German people during World War II. But I gave it two stars cause I didn't like the way it was written. The flow was jerky and the paragraphs were way too short. There was almost nothing about how the narrator felt, only description of his actions. The whole book went by too fast. I didn't like the protagonist not having a name, either."
4,I Was There,"This book was a excallent book about what happened or what teenagers did during WWII.It's about the author himself, Hans Peter Richter.Him and his friends, Heniz and gunther join the Hitler youth movement. Hans and Heinz are enthusiastic, but Gunther participates in it only because of pressure on him and his family. Every German youth has a part in Hitler's third Reich. So the youths have to go around soliticing money for the poor, collecting scrap iron,tormenting Jews, taking premilitary training, shouting""Heil Hitler"" when Hitler appears himself and fially, ultanately, serving in the German armed forces.Hans and his friends share the same experince."
1,Worthless,I needed inspiration and this book didn't have it. These are all ordinary ideas you could think of (and probably have) on your own. Don't waste your money.
1,"the jewelry is cheap, but the price is not","The pendant is stamped from thin silver (instead of being cast); it's very poor quality, but the price was almost twice as much as I usually pay online for high quality silver charms."
4,"Sublime, elegant polyphony","This CD of Schola Adventus is a marvel for clarity, sensitivity and balance of voices. It is abundantly clear that this singing group is in its element (Renaissance polyphony).Definitely recommended! Listeners will be taken to new heights."
2,"BORING,BORING,BORING","I can`t believe someone lose time to write a book like that. This book is boring from the first to the last page.And from all possible sides of the book,the story,the pics,etc...When you think about the Cleveland Browns the first thing who come to you is the fans and the Dawg pound ,the author miss that part too.He can`t make you feel what it is to be a Browns fan.The way he write the story of the team and the player can`t keep your attention on the book.You have to read two or three time the same paragraph cause your eyes close by themselve.I gave two stars for the effort the author put in this book.But if you really want to buy this book take the paperback version cause the hardcover are double price.Keep the rest of money to buy another book about the Browns maybe you`re gonna be more lucky with the other one."
2,"Great musicians, pity about the pianist.","Slide Hampton in fine form, backed by a great bass player (Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen) and a legendary drummer (Philly Joe Jones)... too bad the pianist (Joachim Kuhn, unbelievably self-centered and brimming with boy-genius mannerisms) almost spoils the session. I say ""almost"" because on one tune (J.J. Johnson's ""Lament"") Kuhn actually manages to summon enough restraint to avoid wrecking the proceedings."
2,Lassie remake 2 thumbs down,"I admit that the photography and beauty of this film by far surpasses the original Lassie Come Home. This is to be expected though considering the times in which the two movies were produced. In the new movie the story line very loosely follows the book, leaving out crucial scenes. And what was up with the Lock Ness Monster?! That scene made absolutely no sense. Why did this movie change the ending? It should have stuck with the story and ending in the book and a better acting Lassie. They even left out the famous swimming across the river scene...the scene that made Pal, the first Lassie, a star.If all you want is lovely scenery then this is a movie for you. But for the rest of you die hard Lassie fans, stick with the book and the original movie. Trust me, you will be dissapointed with all the changes made."
5,Completely in AWE!,"Wow! This film is true to the original story: authentic of life in Great Britian in pre WWII. The cinematography is fantastic--you want to climb right into the movie and be with Lassie. An exceptional film. As a side note, I show it to my students the day before winter vacation and they adore it! Some ask to borrow it over vaction to share with their families!"
3,"More Mexicans, less environment?","An adequate introduction, but smacks of a Southwestern/ parochial 'reconquista' (""El Norte"" is filled with back-packing urban elites who are not as sensitive to environmental issues as Mexican-Americans who have had their 'homeland' usurped). Pena also fails to mention the Mexican government's historic involvement in assisting the migration of Mexicans to the U.S. to serve capitalist interests, and, early Mexico's hostile treatment of Indians (in current N.M) centuries ago. Still, I'd like to see my native born (Mexican-American)daughter read the book and filter through some of the weak spots to get an idea of the eco-battles she'll probably be waging in either an urban or rural environment she'll call home. Pena fails as well to consider the impact on the American env. as more and more Mexicans cross the border and attempt to make a home here as well."
3,Not about Sputnik,This program has little to do with Sputnik and the Russian space program. This program is about how the USA could've been number one to space and why that didn't happen. It was done very well and it includes some interviews with the people behind von Braun's team but the title is misleading. I guess I should've read the reviews before buying it. I was looking for programs on the Russian side of things.
4,Muy Bueno,Este disco recoge las mejores piezas de los ultimos a~nos de estos grandes de la Salsa. Digno de Comprarlo.
4,Sabroso,Reune las mejores canciones de todo el trayecto de estos grandes de la Sala. Digno de Comprar.
4,Jose Jose's 1979 bestseller .,"This 1979 release was one of Jose Jose's most popular albums of the decade and featured production and songwriting from Camilo Sesto, Rafael Perez-Botija, Napoleon and others. The immensely popular title track was responsible for the album's strong sales but ""Mientras Llueve"", ""Rosa De Fuego"" and ""Tu Primera Vez"" were the real standouts. Avoid the closing track (the disco-rock number ""Linda Disco"")- it's simply ludicrous."
1,disappointing,"Excellent delivery time from Amazon, but unfortunately the product was a disappointment. The mantles produce a low level yellowish light which would barely cast a shadow. Additionally, within a week they began to burn out."
1,Arrived shattered,"We have 4 gas lights and I usually keep a supply of these mantles. Somehow I ended up with an odd number and I just needed one mantle to service our lights. They shipped me one mantle in a bubble wrap envelope and it arrived shattered. The sellers change, and I bought mine through AG Distributors & Supplies Corp, however I then bought some from BIC Warehouse and they shipped them the same way. 3 of the BIC mantles were shattered. These mantles are fragile and should be shipped in a box. With the shipping method, even the ones that arrived whole I will have to wait to see if their life is diminished by the obvious jostling they received during shipping. On the upside, amazon was great handling my return and refund."
1,Defective...,"I had purchased 8 of these hard inverted mantles from American Mantle, but when I tried to replace 2 old mantles I had in my outdoor gaslamp, 1 of the new ones I just purchased crumbled when I took it out of the box and another would only light on one side. I have ordered from this vendor before and of the six I had previously bought, 1 would not light at all for some reason. I don't know if this company's stock is too old, not being stored/handled properly, or just lacking in quality control, but caveat emptor."
1,"Too small, no advantage over soft mantels",Received two in first order and one was broken. The mantels are too small and do not give enought light. The soft are cheaper and work better.
2,Not effective,"I disagree with the rave reviews presented here. I had an old Dentek scraper that worked wonders due to its sharp edge, but it broke and I've been on the search for a good replacement. I thought this product would do the trick after reading the reviews, but I was disappointed. It is better than the other plastic models currently on the market which are basically worthless in my opinion with no edge. But still it is not sharp enough! Argh. I'm beginning to wonder if they stopped making sharp edges for liability reasons :("
2,Toung Sweeper Pro,The product pictured is not what you will receive. They have positioned the product to give the appearance that it's a solid piece of steel. The Tongue Sweeper Pro is a very thin piece of metal and does NOT do as effective job of some of the other plastic models out there. Buyer beware!
4,A must have for oral hygiene,"This product definitely works as advertised, I haven't tried any other togneu scraper so I can't compare it to others but after a few days of usage I can safely say that bad breath is no longer a problem. I recommend this to anyone really that wants good oral hygiene."
1,Don't fall for the positive reviews,I've been cleaning my toungue via toothbrush for years. Tried both gentle and rough scraping and it does very little. Doesn't even get close to cleaning off what a toothbrush does
3,This is okay but,I wish I had never wasted my money on this tongue sweeper. I would rather use a plastic one from Dentek. My entire mouth feels better after I have used the tongue sweeper.
4,Sometimes older is better,"This review is being written from memory of when I used to watch this movie on TV!! It's a little dated with lack of today's spectacular FX, but it's still a good, clean, old-time fanstasy based on a fairly tale that the whole family can watch.I liked the story (even though it doesn't follow the actual story exactly, because in the fairly tale there was no happy ending). The music was great and based off classical music and used very effectively throughout the movie. (The piece used as the piper's tune to lure the rats away has stuck with me all my life.) Definitely a movie parents can let children can watch and not be worried about filthy language or horrifying special effects. It also teaches a lesson about honor and the consequences of not living up to it. Highly recommended."
3,Very bad transfer.,"The quality of this film is very bad. If you want to get the good version, I would suggestThe Pied Piper of Hamelin. This film has already been reviewed on the aspects of the film, so I will just say, "" Save your money on this version."""
1,not what i expected!,"it's awful! it's not dots, it's snowflakes. the fabric is so thin you can see right through it! and it feels like sand paper. I even paid the extra money to have it express shipped because i needed it by a certain date, it's horrible do not waste your time or money!"
5,INSPIRATIONAL ALBUM,"CHERI KEAGGY HAS A STYLE ALL HER OWN.She draws you into her song and make you feel what she feels,whether its an upbeat song towards the Lord such as We hAVE COME TO WORSHIP HIM/JOY IN THE LORD,MORE OF YOU AND her signature classic<""CHILD OF THE FATHER"">A dynamic performer/minister in concert,not to be missed by the young and the young at heart.I look forward to all her cd's.Alot of her songs have been incorporatedinto our Sunday praise and worship..Make it yours too,today."
5,This is a great CD to listen to. I highly recommend it.,I really enjoy listening to her music. The songs are awesome to listen to and carry great messages. I eagerly look forward to getting her other CD's. I recommend this CD.
1,blame it on the night,The video is so degraded that it can not be viewed..It almost looks like the tape is stretched....I will not purchase again.
4,Father/Son Vehicle,Excellent story of father/son relationship going from bad to better leading each free to pursue their own dreams in life yet remain in a relationship filled with mutual love and respect. Great Soundtrack! I have seached for a long time for the movie and/or the soundtrack. Can't find either but worth the time to search.
3,Ted Neeley Superstar,Ted Neeley is the unseen star of this movie. He wrote the songs and sings them. Nick Mancuso just lip syncs. I wish a soundtrack had been released.
1,Moisture in google,I purchased these goggles after I had Lasik. I wore them once during Karate just for a little protection for my eyes. Not meant for full force blow to the head. I had them on for about 2 minutes and moisture started to build up inside the goggles which made it hard to see. I would not purchase these..I was inside and had moisture build up.
5,Brigitte Bardot Rules!!,"This is a great,highly recommended documentary video of the reknowned,sexy,sensuous French movie actress Brigitte Bardot.Brigitte,we all love you, always and forever!!!"
5,An incredible time capsule of Jorge Negrete at his best.,"There will never be another authentic Mexican singer to equal his charisma and ability to sing corridos, rancheras and ballads. He could sing everything, as I can best remember. I remember his movies and his singing from the 40's and 50's. Whenever I listen to his Exitos Inmortales, I can go back in time to re-live and experience the Golden Age of the Mexican Charro."
4,Excellant product,"Glad I got the full size bed. The warmer works well once you figure the control.Now, to just start using it more."
3,Big Table,the table is great but is very heavy and bigger that I though. Other than that the table is great. I Buy this table to take it to places but is way heavier than 45 bls. Just make sure you buy a carrier or a dollie.
3,Decent table for the price,"This is a good table for the price, but (as expected) you are losing out a bit on quality when buying a cheaper table. I would recommend it for students and for those just starting out. It is a little on the heavy side, so it is not very practical if you travel a lot with your table. The face rest cushion leaves much to be desired. It is very thin, about half the thickness of a typical face rest cushion. However, it is detachable with velcro on the underside, so it is possible to replace it with a thicker cushion. The face cradle is adjustable, which is nice, and the table is comfortable to lay on. I have mine covered in a fleece pad for a little extra cushion. The table is sturdy and seems to be decently constructed. Easy to set up and take down. The armrest is a nice feature, an additional comfort for your clients."
4,THE HUNTING GAME WHERE YOU ARE THE PREY,Dont get me wrong i like a lot of hunting games but this 1 captures it in a ceratin way. Now u the hunter must watch ur back. Stalk and be stalked through dense fogs and mountains terain in search for the dinasour of a life time or the jaws of a T-REX. this game has awsome 3D ENVIRONMENTS. great sound and the animal AI is pretty good. I'd recomend this to anyone. But id wait for Carnivores 2. it should have all this game has and more.
4,A fun hunting experience for fans of dinosaurs,"Carnivores is a fun hunting experience, easy to navigate, full of tension, and graphically satisfying without being overly graphic."
5,"Buenos Aires, dias, tardes and noches","I find myself still reading this fascinating guide even after my return. The In Context section, which includes the chapters: History, Architecture, Literary Buenos Aires and Tango is well written and full of information. My favorite quote from this section is, ""By the time you're reading this, Buenos Aires could be in the grip of an economic crisis, or the good times might just be rolling again."" Ahem.The hotel, museum, monument and restaurant information was useful and truthful. The maps are clearly notated and easy to read, but if they could find a way to show the topography, the hills wouldn't have been such a suprise.I'll definitely take a Time Out guide on my next adventure."
4,Hollywoodized/dramatic,"We have been studying the book of Ruth (from the Bible) and were interested in a film portraying the Biblical story. This version is quite embellished, and quite Hollywoodized and melodramatic. The costumes likewise were very overdone...but in many respects it was an attractive film and was interesting to watch (many new twists and turns of the plot were added to the Biblical story.)The acting was good...very 1960...and the quality of the camera work, etc. was good. I was entertained, but not thrilled. I will keep it, but expect to have to explain to your children the differences between this film and the real Biblical account...not at all the same story."
3,99% Fiction,"Great production,Great settings and props,Great color.< 1% accurate.Typical hollywood fare.Stuart Whitman is always fun; curious that he would have top billing and not show up until halfway through the movie.Ruth as a Moabite Priestess story line is complete fiction."
3,Nice Story but only about 10% form the Bible,It was a nice story and fun to watch but if you compare it to the Bible it really did not follow the book of Ruth to much. It used the name and time period and did some history for the time. It did help with the idea why Ruth might not have wanted to return to her family and to leave the country and her religion but it had a lot of speculations made. So if you just want to watch it as a fun movie then it was nice.
5,Loved it.,"I loved it! After watching this movie, I went back and read the book of Ruth in the Bible. I thought it was a wonderful embellishment of the story."
1,SO disappointed,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I purchased it to supplement our biblical history home school curriculum. There is very little factual information in this movie. Every character and the timeline are misrepresented. The beauty of Boaz as a picture of Christ is totally lost because of the unbiblical way he initially treats Ruth in this film. Orpha's role is completely wrong and the ""closer kinsman"" couldn't be any further away from accurate.Please, if you are looking for a screen version of the beautiful book of Ruth, don't waste your money here. I'm so sorry I allowed my daugther to see this movie."
4,"Interesting, Fun To Watch, The Names Are The Same, But The Story Is WAY TOO LOOSELY Based On The Bible","If you are hoping to see the Book of Ruth acted out, as I was, this isn't that. It's interesting, fun to watch, and I enjoyed it.However, nothing in the scriptures tell us that Ruth was some kind of priestess who led children to be sacrificed before she met Mahlon, Naomi's son. They made it into an exciting ""action"" movie all to itself, but it had nothing to do with the original story in the Bible.Personally, I feel that the Biblical story was interesting enough without making it into something entirely different. However, even that can be done badly. I watched another DVD that was probably about as accurate as a movie can be, but they did such a terrible job on that one that they took all the passion out of it. I'll do a review on that one as well.Maybe someday someone will do this story accurately and well. Until then, we have it as written in the Bible, a beautiful story which is worth reading."
3,"Okay, but not the Bible","The Story of Ruth, the movie, adds a great deal to the biblical story of Ruth and changes some of the biblical narrative. I understand why there are additions to fill in some of the gaps, but I have never understood why writers and directors want to change the biblical story. For instance, Boaz's rival wants Ruth in this film. In the biblical story it appears his rival want's land, but is very willing to give up the land when he learns it comes with Ruth. The film shows Jewish disdain for Ruth because she is a Moabitess. Even Boaz initially shows disdain in the film. There is no such showing in the biblical story. Boaz appears gracious from the beginning in the Bible.That having been said, the film is still worth watching and does capture the essence of the biblical story of Ruth."
5,A great film of a great Hollywood period!,"The Story of Ruth was released in 1960 and I remember seeing it on a wide wide screen, curved, and in stereophonic sound; it was glorious, as were all Cinemascope films.This film is not the Bible, but a meditation on it, factual, no, but it gets the point of The Book of Ruth across.The best bits are a very moving perfromance by Peggy Wood as Naomi, and some stylish acting by Elena Eden and Stuart Whitman.The Wood scenes are excellent, and Naomi's prayer is quite striking, all filmed in a small house in earth tones...very good. Peggy Wood's many scenes of emotional upheaval are instances of excellent screen acting.The Moabite scenes are crazy, as is all of that Chemosh stuff, but this film has great appeal...for die hards only, and especially for cinemascope afficionados of yore who can re-imagine it all even on the tiny screens we must put up with now, TV and movie alike. Buy and enjoy. Still not letterboxed."
5,The Story of Ruth,"I had seen this movie in a theater when it first came out forty some years ago. I liked it very much then. I became more impressed about the story of Ruth when I became a christian later in my life and learned more about the story from the Bible. I bought the DVD the first chance I got. I liked this movie not only because it was a epic story about love, faith and courage but also I very much enjoyed the high quality of the remastered widescreened cinemagraphy by the 20th Century Fox. It's a great movie!!"
3,The Story of Ruth,"Ketuvim ""Writings"" (Book: Ruth [Rut in Hebrew])This movie has taken license in adding to the actual storyline of Ruth. An examples are; When the two Moabs claim to be kinsmen from the tribe of Reuben, or when she is married to Mahlon (her first husband) for a brief moment prior to his death, etc. The movie is well put together, but it does stray a bit from the actual writings. [see Ruth 1:16-17]Good movie. I would recomment it."
2,Tthe Story of Ruth,"The beginning of this movie is way out of the ballpark. Why would they make up something just because the Bible doesn't specify where Ruth came from. Couldn't they have made her come from more noble background? However i do watch it fairly often. As the truth is revealed rothe idol worshiping Ruth, she realizes that sacrificing little girls is wrong and she runs away from it and ends up in the royal bloodline of King David himself."
2,Not suitable for little children,"I started watching this movie on TBN, but never finished it, bec I did not like all the extreme scenes in Moab and I also felt it was not suitable for my little children. So I would not buy this movie. The new Ruth movie w/ Carmen, that was just released in 2009 is much better and close to the bible account"
4,Like at the movie theater,Excellant color and it was just like to the movie at the theater when I first saw it. Thanks alot for some fine entertainment.
2,Misleading,"I bought the video Ruth, not realizing that it was anold film and not part of the more recent Bible series. There is very little in this rendition of Ruth that is actually accurate, or that corresponds to the Biblical account. In addition, it is portrayed in typical Hollywood fashion. I look forward to learning how much of it was taken from actually research."
3,Back when they knew how to do a Biblical Epic,"The film takes the storyline of the Ruth from the Bible and fills it with lavish costumes and sets. The Moab temple scenes, the outfits worn by the cult they worshipped, etc. are all well done. The acting was all good, although it was surprising to see the actor who played Sergeant Schultz in Hogan's Heroes playing the King of Moab in this film. It was even more jarring to realize that he doesn't sound anything like his character on TV.The only reason this movie doesn't get a higher rating is that it just never seems to ""take off"" or to pace itself. Nevertheless, definitely worth watching."
4,Spiritual and Love Story,"I love this movie, aside from the biblical teaching, an excellent story of courage. It shows how God uses a woman, her beauty, and intelligence to free his people."
1,The Story of Ruth,"Note to Amazon...I have not opened the DVD. I read the captions, and when I realized from their description that they did not follow the Biblical text, I chose not to watch it. I had just finished a study on the Book of Ruth so I was hoping this would be something I would enjoy and could share. :-("
3,Not close enough for me,"Way to much time is spent with Ruth before she marries Naomi's son, and the movie has all three, Naomi's husband and two children, being stabbed to death. I expected the Story of Ruth to be the Biblical account and it isn't. I would not recommend this movie. However for a very good movie I would recommend The Perfect Stranger 1 & 2 or Joshua. All three are great movies and I would recommend them for those that are not belivers."
3,The Story of Ruth,Even though this did not go along with the old testament story it was still a good movie. This movie was good for the family. To get the true story one needs to read the Book of Ruth in the bible.
1,"Too, bad the screenwriter didn't actually read the story of Ruth in the Bible.","First off, a jew would not be making a pagan statue. The clothes are not according to the law. Where's the blue fringe? It would take forever to list the discrepancies. Saw the beginning...skipped to the end."
3,good law book from a good former dean,I went to the law school where Kay used to be the dean. She's a nice lady. She spearheaded many of the non-sexist divorce laws in California. I'm not going to say there aren't better feminist law texts out there. But this book is a decent one. It should be a valuable tool for feminist lawyers or future feminist lawyers.
4,Good Read About NYPD,"This is a compilation of stories from eleven authors. The time frame is from the 1800's up to the case of Abner Louima in 1997. Along the way the reader learns about the Civil War riots, corrupt and hero cops as well as visits to the tough precincts on the Bronx and Brooklyn. Good collection."
4,Street Stories from the men in Blue,"Adrenaline books published this book, so that tells you something- it's going to be heart pounding, fast paced, gritty reading. The stories are from the cops themselves. What it's like to work in the toughest hoods, alone with you and your patrol car. The stories range as far back as the 1860's to the present. Detectives, beat cops, undercover cops, corrupt cops are all told in their own words.Police dramas on TV and movies are popular for a reason. They're interesting-as is this book. Even the bad cops draw out empathy - they fell victim to the constant temptation and corruption that's out there. But there's a lot more good than not. Hard working stiffs who done a uniform and try to keep the peace in a fragile balance of the world of crime vs. normalcy. This is a great book for those who want to get an insiders glimpse of a high risk job, an adrenaline rush, true stories that read like good fiction."
4,Praying Mama,"I have been trying to find an album or cassette for a long time (years) with the song, ""It's a Blessing"". When I decided to search Amazon site I didn't even know the name of the album but I knew the artist. It popped right up. What a blessing! Thanks Amazon!"
3,Good Condition,"The CD was in good condition, however when I put the CD into my computer and it opened with Windows media, it opened with a different groups CD cover called A.B.G., but the music was Maya Angelou."
5,Making Assessment Easier and More Efficient!,"The Testing and Assessment kit contains a wide range of assessment options. There are Lesson Quizzes (one per lesson, include listening, reading, and writing), Unit Tests (two forms per unit, both include listening, reading, writing, and cultural questions), Comprehensive Tests (testing parts of the book - can be used as a mid-term and/or final exam. There is also Portfolio Assessment options, as well as Proficiency Tests for Reading Comprehension, Writing, Listening Comprehension, and Speaking Skills. Finally, Several Audio Tapes are included in this set.This program is a ""must have"" for any teacher using Spanish For Mastery 1. It is very well linked with the student textbook and can be used in multiple forms and variations."
5,Who would think a train movie could be so dramatic?,"This movie takes the viewer all across India on board their spectacular train system. We see all this through the film at a stage where India is shifting from using steam locomotives to electric and diesel. National Geographic shows the viewer how emotionally attached people can become to their careers, i.e. the steam locomotive crew.The viewer will see breathtaking vistas of India and become a little more knowledgeable in the Indian culture.All in all, this movie was very good, and if one were to be visiting India someday, or has a fascination for locomotives, this is the movie to watch."
1,Not what the book claims to be.,"The book is old with no updates, and while the book started off with good explanations, that quickly died. It seems like the book was getting too long, so the authors decided not to cover certain things, or would state that what they weren't covering was easy to do (like secure transactions). Not a good reference book or how to manual. There are plenty of other good books out there. I can see why the publisher no longer even acknowleges this book as theirs anymore."
2,A Mess,"The item arrived with one side of the handle off. The grommet or whatever holds it on with other pieces were loose, broken off.The opening on top is hard to reach with the handle in the way. Bodum has a similarly shaped pot, much better designed (the whole top comes off on that oen).Altogether, an impression of poor manufacture, incouding the finish."
4,20 Exitos de Miguel Aceves Mejia,I'm very happy with the CD as a whole. I remember over half of the songs from movies and such. There were several songs that I'd never heard and one that is from a very old recording and very noticeable.
4,Love Miguel Aceves Mejia's music,"Great songs, but when I transferred it to my iPod the listing of the songs was a bit messy. Never mind, I am just glad to get recordings by this superb singer."
4,A good resource regarding agricultural emergency response.,"This unique text focuses on emergency response to agricultural accidents. Many pertinant topics are discussed including farm machinery, animal hazards, incident command, etc.There are few good sources of information on this important topic, this is one. While the author ocassionally is tunnel-visioned regarding the problem solving skills possessed by modern rescue personnel, the book is generally precise, modern and well-researched.Farming accidents are common (agriculture is the most dangerous industry in the country), and almost always present emergency crews with unique challenges. Those challenges can be life-threatening not only for the accident victim, but the rescuers as well. This book presents information that is quite useful in improving patient care and the safety of the responders."
5,One of the finest scores ever written,"This sweeping work is one of Brian Tyler's finest scores to date with melodies that haunt my every waking moment. The main title, ""Tears of Joy,"" ""Transformation of Gian"", and ""Sirsa"" are my favorite songs. Every piece is superb. The credits show that Tyler conducted the Hollywood Studio Symphony which is also outstanding. The world music and percussion adds an exotic touch to the powerful listening experience. This is one of my favorite soundtracks even though I have not yet seen the movie."
4,Partition Soundtrack CD,Brian Tyler's composition goes extremely well with the movie and evokes the deep emotions protrayed in the movie. I am particularly touched by the End Credit song.
1,NEW BUT SCRATCH,I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE DVD S WERE ALL SCRATCH WHEN THEY SUPPOSED TO BE NEW!!/ I CALLEDCOMPANY & THEY WANTED FOR ME TO SEND THEM BACK TO GET MY REFUND // I DIDNT SEND IT BACK BEC A HAVE TO PAY FOR MAILING FEES/
1,Attractive guitar but that is about it.,This guitar is a very attractive red color but there are a few noticeable blemishes in the spray paint. We did not receive a full set of strings. We received three strings and none of them are the correct size to replace the one that broke upon our initial tuning. The guitar strap is practically useless without a strap button to attach it to the neck...ours only has one button located on the bottom of the body of the guitar.We weren't expecting a guitar for a rock star but we were expecting to receive at least what was described to us on Amazon.
2,Not Satisfied! ! !,"I was excited to see that the guitar arrived today...I ordered it last Wednesday for my 13 year old son. However, upon opening the container I found a few dents here and there and also a crack along the neck joint. There is paint on the frets and the nut is slightly raised from the fret board. The sticker around the sound hole is slightly off and the bridge is plastic. I thought I was getting this for pretty much a steal but the price reflects what I received. On a lighter note, my son was excited to see it and says that I am extremely picky. He is satisfied but I am going to a music store tonight to see what they have to say in regards of the quality of this instrument. I may be returning this purchase if I find a better instrument there."
5,Buy This Album NOW!!!!!!,"Rachel, Ben and Kim have outdone themselves on what is definately one of the best albums of the year! Any fan of music needs to own this album. Great hooks, great lyrics, great playing and great times! Don't miss out! Buy this album now so that soon you can be the super cool groove master who says ""I knew about them before they were big!"" Why are you still reading this? Hit the BUY IT NOW button NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Are you people nuts?,"Am baffled by the raves! Talk about the sophomore slump. Their debut CD was fresh and every song insanely catchy. This record really stinks. Melodies, lyrics, everything. In my opinion, this one is headed for the $1.99 used bins."
2,not water proof,"These were sold to me on the basis that they are water proof, much more than just water resistant.I have 6 of these, 3 have leaked-badly (the ones with kids who have occassional accidents). 2 matresses have been soiled and Southern textiles put the responsibility back on me. Did you use bleach washing it? What temp was your dryer? I cared for the product exactly according to their instructions. They replaced the leaky protectors and even one of those leaked. I have to use their chemical products to clean my matresses before they will even consider replacing them, if at all, and I am told that they will probably not, by their warranties dept.Another problem with the protectors is that the elastic sides rip, 4 have done this, of the 6 I own. The rip starts with a small whole but eventually shreds, making it very difficult to put on to the matress.I spent way to much money on this product. Hopefully you wont."
1,Product IS NOT WHAT IS SENT! WARNING!!!!,"The product that is PICTURED is the 500 gram bottle (17.56 OZ Bottle). They send you the 10.5 OZ Bottle Thus the ""price"" break. The product itself is good but Healthforce better wise up and stop advertizing the WRONG PICTURED PRODUCT! FIX IT YOU FOOLS! ADVERTISE WHAT YOU SELL. POST THE PROPER BOTTLE. DO IT RIGHT."
2,Try something else,Tried this to supplement my other vitamins. I didn't see/feel any difference. Go buy somewhere local and save on S & H
4,Beautiful book,This book has beautiful photographs and lovely poems about places and is aesthetic treat. It does not have long descriptions of places with explanations but is a series of small spiritual snapshots.
4,A Cool Game,"If Quiver, the macintosh editor for this game, had never been released, I would rate this a 2. This is the only fully 3D game with a mac compatible level editor in existence (Marathon is 2.5D). Unfortunately, Quiver is shareware and costs 20 bucks. I still have no idea what the storyline is (being a marathon addict, I expect a storyline), but the gameplay is okay. What really boosted my opinion of the game is the fact that a program that converts maps made for quake to quake 3 has been released. Now it is possible to make Q3 maps on a mac."
4,"Outdated, but...","...still enjoyable. I picked up this game for cheap because I wanted to see what the first version of Quake looked like, which I'd never played. It's very, very primitive by modern standards, but would be of interest to anyone who wants to see the evolution of what has become a major gaming franchise."
3,Gr8 fps,"talk to me a few years ago, i would have given it 5 stars, quake did for fps what final fantasy did for rpgs. Quake has good graphics for when it was made and it is ok in single player mode. Quake is really great over the internet though (if you can deal with the net lag) Quake capture the flag has to be one of the most addicting games on the net. This game is good to pick up also because it isnt that expensive. If you want a more current fps go for quake III arena, red faction, or unreal tournament."
3,A solid basic introduction to the business,"If you are interested in becoming a home inspector, this book is a great place to start. It will give you the nuts and bolts about the profession as well as the tools and marketing skills required. The author lays it out in a very simple and easy to read format. I emphasize this is a great place to start, you will need to go elsewhere to find the technical knowledge and information you need to do a professional home inspection, and the author does provide a helpful list of resources at the back of the book. It is a bit expensive but information like this is hard to come by and you can save yourself a bundle of cash in the long run by heeding his advice. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to get into the home inspection field."
3,Good but way overpriced,This book has some good information on how to start a Home Inspection business but it is really overpriced. Most of the valuable information is how to run the business but if your looking for how to become at trained home inspector you won't find it here. ... Wow that's pricey. In addition the author spends a good portion of the book on how to use their copyrighted home inspection reports which must be purchased separtley to for your use. If your not interested in using those reports these sections of the book are not very useful.
5,Just What I Was Looking For,"The many actual samples from home inspection reports and the constant emphasis on how to inspect and report while avoiding legal hassles is just what I was looking for. Even though I know a lot about houses, I didn't know how to do a home inspection or what was supposed to be in a home inspection report, but I do now. I highly recommend this book."
1,Won't work at all.,I tried this cable with a G5 Mac and both LaCie and EZQuest drives. Neither drive would mount on the desktop. OEM cables were very short but worked perfectly. Perhaps one of the 9 pins were damaged. Cable shipped without retail package. Perhaps this is a factory second? I'm probably going to try the Belkin cable next.
5,Excellent and concise,Good overview of the relationship between attachment and emotional functioning in marriage. The manualized treatment approach has been empirically supported so deserves more than just a glance. An excellent addition to the libraries of anyone interested in and encountering the challenges of couples counseling.
4,"Good, if occasionally didactic","Freedom Principle definitely suffers from the author's avocation as music critic--the prose is choppy, and the big thematic ideas occasionally get lost in the minutiae. Chapter 1 ""Steps in Search of Freedom"" is especially desultory and poorly focused. The chapters on individual players are better.That said, the book is an excellent introduction to the free jazz movement, and covers the major players well, with very insightful discussions of individual works and solos.Litweiler is at his worst when his own opinions come blazing through; he loves free jazz and despises rock. It's an opinion shared by others, to be sure, but he belabors his point, and, in the final chapters, all but bludgeons his reader with it. It's a fairly ironic twist in a book dedicated to the unbridled freedom of musical expression."
2,"Lots of chit-chat, light on rudiments","Like Buddy Rich, Ian Paice can do more with his left hand than most drummers who use a super kit and lazer beams. This performance is not even close to what Paice is capable of, but, as usual, he is brilliant. Chad Smith is steady."
5,Keeps Kids Entertained!,"My daughters were 4 & 3 when we first got this game, and they still love it at ages 6 & 5. They could sit and play this for hours! It took Mom's help to start - but then they were off & ""racing""!! (Press the F1 key for game hints & instructions.)The game changes every time you play and builds memory and teaches thinking skills - but kids don't realize that they are actually learning something! It is a fun game and definately worth the money!I enjoy ALL of the Humongous/Infogrames games--OH, so do my girls!! Ha Ha! Freddi Fish, Putt Putt, and Pajama Sam have become my girl's favorites! They beg to play almost every night!! Definately a good buy! Even up to age 8 or 9 should enjoy! (I'm 33 and I do!!) :-)1smileycat :-)"
5,Best kid games...,"My kid has all the Freddi Fish , Spy Fox , Pajama Sam &Putt-Putt titles.My kid loved the games since he was 4 years old.Humongous Entertainment did an excellent job.These games will challenge the intelligence of kids."
2,poorly written,My 3 yr old grand sone likes it but I have to set up the video resolution before it will work. All of these games seem to be written by different people and none are very professional.
4,"Lacking in some places, but a MUST for all Al fans!","This rockumentary spoof also contains eight of Al's music videos (Which, at the time this movie was made, were the only music videos he had done). This was also made while Al was at one of his many career peaks. Originally a Showtime special, this movie is an almost-true account of Al's life. Even the FBI warning at the beginning is a spoof! There are spots where this one tends to drag...at the time, Al didn't direct himself yet. However, there are some very memorable parts to this video, especially the AlTV section, which shows several of his skits from the MTV specials that had been made at the time. The music videos are also quite good. This is still a must for any Al fan, but not up to par with Weird Al's more recent efforts."
1,Don't waste your time...,"""Of Nightingales That Weep"" was a book that I read purely because I had to, at school. The plot is weak and at times confusing. The main character is so selfish that it's not even funny, and her selfishness, unlike some bad traits of characters, doesn't help the plot. In the end, she has a baby with her stepfather, which disgusted most of the kids in my English class.If you really want to read something about Japan, try a piece from Japan. It is much more accurate and the characters are most likely not selfish."
4,"Of Nightingales That Weep, a review by Dylan","Of Nightingales that Weep is a good book. The story is good, but there are several boring parts. The book is about Takiko, a young woman in feudal Japan. She is born to a respectable samurai who dies in a war. Her mother marries a peasant, and they live here for a while. Soon she goes to the princes/emperors court and stays there. Now she must choose which rival clan to support, the Genji of Heiki, the clan of her father or the clan of the emperor. Read the book to find out. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read historical fiction."
3,Riches to rags story,"I'm a fan of Katherine Paterson, so I was eager to read this book. It was a colorful, emotional tale about Takiko, a samurai's daughter in feudal Japan. Since it was wartime, she had to move from place to place (including a palace) to escape the adversary. On the way, she met a handsome young enemy warrior named Hideo and they fell in love. Would she choose loyalty to her dead father's cause or to forbidden romance? The choice she made affected her entire life. I wanted to love the story, but it was too tragic. Many of Takiko's loved ones died throughout the course of the novel. Hideo abandoned her, as did her beauty and wealth. However, it's a tribute to Mrs. Paterson's skill that a fictional story could arouse so much feeling in me. However, the ironic ending confused me. Why did the events turn out the way they did? Still, I reccomend this book for its vivid descriptions of feudal Japan and its skill in plucking one's heartstrings."
2,Good Box,"They did a great job with the dvd case. They promise a really sexy and sick horror film. What you get is a rehashed plot you've seen a hundred times, nothing sexy. Even Kristy Swanson is wasted in the film because she is obviously pregnant the entire time. Yes there are 5 murders, but aside from the rack sequence, most are common fare. I would skip this one."
3,Plot taken from Buried Alive,"First of all they took the plot directly from Buried Alive so if you want to see a much better version may I suggust Buried Alive or Buried Alive II. Second, I still will never understand why someone INSISTS on making a movie (I can understand sitcoms & soaps but NOT movies)when one of the main characters is pregnant and they try to cover it up all during the movie. Sure, they eventually worked it in but only after you spend the whole movie watching the beautiful Kristy Swanson in a completely seductive role walking around in the same dress all during the movie in this obvious bloated state."
3,Living Death,"Kristy Swanson stars as the wife of a sadistic millionaire who plots to kill her husband with the help of the family lawyer. Their attempt to poison him fails, and he awakens in the morgue with his mind set on revenge. LIVING DEATH sells itself on being just another Torture Porn entry in a long line of HOSTEL imitators, but it plays out like any other average revenge thriller where money is always the motive. The torture devices laid out in the opening act are not revisited until the final scene, although there are scattered kills throughout the remainder of the run time that offer a decent amount of bloodshed. What really takes away from the film is the uneven tone, where the otherwise serious plot is broken up by unnecessary bits of slapstick in the morgue. LIVING DEATH may not break any new ground, but one can do much worse when it comes to the murder for money theme.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,dont watch,"do not click to watch this movie, its retarded! the acting is terrible, the filming sucks and it is all around bad"
5,Hot,Installed by a pro today this box is hot found the best price on amazon would recomend to anyone fits custom
5,My favorite Mother Goose,"I have never been a big fan of Mother Goose books---generally because I am not a poetry fan and let's face it---they are poetry! But when I saw my favorite children's author, Rosemary Wells, illustrated this book, I had to have it, and I am so glad I did! My boys love it and so do it. Her painting for this book are so interesting and varied, and they incorporate themes that are real crowd pleasers in the under 6 set---lots of moons, trains and pictures of bunnies that look a lot like Max, her hero of her great Max and Ruby series. The selections here include some of the more unusual Mother Gooses, along with the old favorites. My boys ask for this book over and over and are learning a lot of Mother Goose. This is definately worth adding to your library."
5,My Very First Mother Goose,Excellent item! This is really an amazing item that anybody could buy for their very own personal time and pleasure.
3,Hmmm,"I was looking for a nice nursery rhyme book, this one is OKAY I guess but it does have a lot of of rhymes in it that I have never even heard of. It also really annoys me that they change the wording of some of the popular ones. The graphics are colourful but could definitely be more Creative. I would recommend for an older toddler."
4,Firt Mother Goose Bood,It is a good starting book to read to a baby. Easy and simple words for a baby to hear.
2,disapointing,"This book has half of the nursery rhymes I grew up with. The ones they do have, they only print half of the rhyme. very disappointed."
5,very nice looking nursery rhyme book,This is a gift for a great grand daughter. Mother Goose books are few and far between in this fast paced world. I wanted her to learn the rhymes so she could pass them on
4,What FUN to read!,Both of my daughters (age 3 years and 19 months) LOVE this book and each has her favorite rhymes. Very easy to read with beautiful BIG pictures. A favorite in my house.
2,My Very First Mother Goose,"The quality of the book as far as illustrations and print...is good, however, I wish I had reviewed my choice closer. I was looking for the more traditional Mother Goose rhymes. The illustrations just did not match my memory of the traditional pictures from my childhood. Humpty Dumpty was actually just a small egg in these pictures...I remember a big egg wearing clothes and having arms and legs sitting on wall. Jack and Jill in this books are rabbits...as most of the characters are. And someone else has pointed out...a lot of the words in the rhymes certainly do not match the old ""Childcraft"" nursery rhymes that I was looking for. I had a hard time keeping my 15 mo old grandson interested in this book. The vendor was prompt in the delivery and description...I do not fault him for my poor selection."
4,Most of the good mother goose rhymes but...,"This has most of the good mother goose rhymes, but isn't the rhyme- hickory dickory dock- not dickory, dickory dock? That one rhyme seems to be misspelled. Everything else is good. SOme of the ryhmes I've never heard of, but they seem to be the old English ones."
1,I GET IT! I GET IT!!,"well....I am certainly in the minority here, but I did NOT like this movie--I do like movies that experiment with narrative structure and I like French movies in general, especially those of Louis Malle....I even admired Last Year at Marienbad....but Mon Oncle was so flat, so uninspiring, so OBVIOUS that I had to turn it off...ok, rats in cage..wow! Now that is original!! Wish I thought of that..actually the scenes sickened me, being an animal lover...the 3 stories were not terribly original, the acting was so-so, and I really found it hard to care for anyone in the film....I had the same feeling after watching My Night at Maud's....just a shrug of indifference, even anger at being so blatantly manipulated into ""appreciating"" the film...anyway, go watch Le Trou or Wages of Fear! See a TRUE classic!!!..Scottyb"
1,Terrible audio and video.,"I don't know about the actual movie... The DVD audio is just awful -- imagine the distortion you get when the volume is set higher than cheap computer speakers can handle, now imagine getting this distortion every time somebody speaks no matter what volume your tv is set at.Also, people move at the wrong speed, and not even a ""consistent"" wrong speed. The subtitles are part of the picture; they can't be turned off."
5,I really enjoyed the experience of learning.,"I work in a Dr's office and I saw this game in the store and I really wanted to try it out. I got the sample version, but I really want the regular version. From what I got from it, it was the best game on the computer to play. You can really see what the Dr's go through. It is tuff, but enjoyable. I hope you never stop making this kind of game. Thanks for the chance to see what goes on back stage."
2,"Can only be played,if you are a real life doctor.","When i bought this game i was excited to get it. The back of the CD made it look like it would be fun. But i was wrong. I like the way you could use all the things and even go to the food machine and get snacks. But the game play was terrible. Their was not any real good help hints to help you out ,it was hard to know what to do next and when you did fine out where to go the patiant would already be dead (i mean not everyone is going to know what to do when they first play this game) so they should have had more helpful hints.They did have a place where you could go and find out what it was your patiant had and what you could do for it.But you could not understand it one bit... unless you had a Med book to look up what they were talking about. They need to keep in mind that this is just a game,not the real thing,and that not everyone is going to take 8 years of Med school just so they can play it. Not worth the buy. save your money for a better game!"
3,Maybe a little too easy...,"I thought this game was a lot of fun. In other words, I got completely addicted to it. However, I made Chief of Staff and treated all 100 patients in less than a week. Once you get to the top, the challenge is gone and it's not much fun anymore."
1,Horrible Game,"Don't ever buy this game! If you ever want to buy an Emergency Room game, the best one is ER- When Disaster Strikes. Better graphics, and you can actually perform the procedures rather than watch."
3,don't expect much,"both are low budget movies with less than stellar acting. i didn't expect a lot when i purchased it, but got less than i expected."
2,so bad lts good,"l cant tell which one ls worse , morons from outer space , big production nothing happening , an alien from la , kathy lreland richard geres ex girlfriend , proving you don't have to be talented to make a sci fi parody , part super mario with bob hoskins and john leguisino , and a very low tech blade runner without harrison ford , the trailer alien from la the best thing of the whole movie , seeing ls believing"
4,One of the best SOTW releases!,"This CD was actually a very pleasant suprise for me. I thought their previous CD, Weights & Measures, was pretty good but just not my favorite side of SOTW.I was really suprised at how great this album was. It sounded like Spirit of the West! Musically and lyrically, they're pretty much right on the mark. Some great lyrics in here.Like another reviewer pointed out, the album is more like ""Save This House"" than a ""Go Figure"" or ""Two Headed."" That's a good thing!Waiting for Martin, Come Back Oscar, July, Wedding Speech, and Be a Guy are among my favorite-ever SOTW songs. They really contain the best elements of the band. ""Enough, Already Alright"" and ""Morning in the Bath Abbey"" are also good listens.Check it out! It's a fantastic listen."
1,do not listen to these guys,"Catch 22 is now just a lame band; nothing else to say. Just look at the CD, half of it is Keasbey Nights stuff which is Tomas' and the other half is Dinosaur Sounds stuff which is the worst CD over. period. do not support this band."
3,Lost its shine,"I've always been a huge Ab Fab fan, and was excited to find this set available. However, I must say that I didn't find the episodes as hilarious as previous ones. The characters have grown older, I have grown older, some of the jokes have grown older...for whatever reason, the shows weren't as funny as I had expected them to be. At times, I felt the celebrity cameos were a bit much. I did like how familiar faces from past episodes did pop up...it was something of a reunion! It was also interesting to find Saffy looking the best of everyone, considering she was always portrayed as looking much older than she actually was."
1,What is with the laugh track?,"I liked this show 100 million years ago. It was satirical, harsh and funny. I was hugely looking forward to this new release. Then the laugh track took over.US TV laugh tracks are really bad - but somehow AbFab managed to get one worse than any I have ever heard. I bought all 3 episodes and watched half of the first one.In the first episode when someone rolls their eyes: hysterical laughter that lasts forever. When someone says something mildly amusing: hysterical laughter that lasts forever. It gets so bad that a line of genuinely humorous dialogue gets obliterated by the laugh track that preceded it when someone lights a cigarette.While the streaming series is only $4.99 - save your money. I turned it off half way through the first episode - I will not watch the other two.Shame on whoever made this mess happen."
5,UK DVD is longer?,"I've seen the first two episodes of this set and was pleasantly surprised that it was still hilarious fun. Without giving anything away, there are some surprises for long-time fans. However, I noticed this runs 90 minutes and the one on the UK Amazon site is 113 minutes. Anyone know why?"
4,20th anniversary!,"Jennifer Saunders does it again! Pasty and Edina are back doing what they do best! They still are funny and entertaining as they have always been! Hope Jennifer writes more absolutely fabulous! Not as funny as the rest of the seasons of ab-fab, but Jennifer still brings enough to make us want more of Pasty and Edina!"
4,absolutely fabulous 20th anniversary special,l It is good to see all the characters back again after a long break and with their own stories to tell. A good laugh!!
3,abfab 20,"Being able to view this was great and easy, amazon is great.If you are a dihard fan of AB FAB you may not be that thrilled with this. It was fun to see the cast again, but the story was a little too much. I adore these caractures and the actors. My favorite parts of AB FAB is Pats and Eddie paring off alone, they have a great chemisry. This just got too silly."
4,Ab Fab,If you are a fan they are as good as they ever were same antics different furniture they are just a bit older but still on the top of their game!...Ha!
5,this is fab,this is great to have in your collection it very funny and you will love it get it now its a hot dvd
3,Not the best,"At first I loved this mini HDV cam but, after it broke the first time it was the main button. Now the CCD is F-ed up. When I bought this unit I was offered the 5 year Mac cam warrinty. This is saving me the cost of a new one."
5,Capable of 720p and 24P,"The JVC GRH-D1 was released two years ago as the world's first hi-def camcorder (at least the world's under-$5000 HD camcorder). It utilizes the new HDV format, developed by JVC and enhanced by Sony, JVC, Sharp and Canon. The GRH-D1 is by now the ""granddaddy"" of HDV camcorders but it's great for those aspiring to shoot HD video. It has a comfortable grip, great image quality, and loads of pro features. The iamge quality is definitely excellent. Shop around to find this for around $2000."
3,My first HD camcorder,I got the JVC GR-HD1 on 2003. The camcorder still work OK. My only complaint is the camcorder is capable of recording in HD only on the tape but not on the memory card! Why?
5,IT'S A WINNER,"""Usually I enjoy crime novels or biographies. When I first started to read The Wild Vine. I expected it to be a novel for women. How mistaken I was! The Wild Vine has every kind of emotion imaginable. It is a novel portraying a family's dysfunction in all of its raw explosive drama. Truly a page turner with the impact of a heavyweight boxers left hook. Looking forward to a sequel.""-Paul Surden, Philadelphia, Pa."
2,WASTE OF MONEY!,"I brought 12 of these, this set and the strawberry one, they are extremely light in weight. when I opened them up the little confetti bits were everywhere, had a cheap fake feel to it. A waste of money, I also brought fake onions from this seller and again light in weight and very fake looking, these cupcakes also when in actual view look fake. I did buy donuts from Glitzy glam half the price of the donuts from these and they have w beautiful weighted feel to them the toppings are on stay on well. I'm convinced GLITZY GLAM stuff is real just with some kind of hard coating on there products, my dog dog even tried eating the donuts. I wish i had gone with Glitzy Glam cupcakes. I will add that the fake food i purchased was for my 2year olds toy market place he loves having the real looking stuff to 'sell' when he plays."
5,More Details...,This is a book with 14 short biographies of courageous Christians:* James Hudson Taylor* Wilfred Grenfell* John Knox* Billy Sunday* John G. Paton* Charles H. Spurgeon* H. A. Ironside* Adoniram Judson* Martin Luther* John Wesley* Robert Moffat* William Booth* Charles T. Studd* David BrainerdThis book provides brief sketches of the lives of these heroes in Christian history. It's a great starting point to delve deeper into those who can inspire you. I remember hearing about many of these men when I was in Sunday School as a child.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"i saw this documentary when it was on tv and at times I had to laugh just to keep from crying about what a travesty this is. First, none of these ""runners"" qualified to run Boston. Think of the thousands of serious runners who train for months to run fast enough in an another Marathon simply to qualify. These people don't deserve a spot at Boston. Second, the film made a big deal about these people being able to finish the race. Some of them took 5-6 hours to complete the race. It is not right for people who haven't earned their way into the race to take up space and tie up the roads. If you can't run under 5 hours at Boston, you shouldn't run-period! It's a race. There are plenty of ""events"" available to people like these and the ""Team in Training"" types where they can pat themselves on the back for running 15 minute miles. Do that. To make a movie about these people celebrating their accomplishments is a slap in the face to any serious runner."
4,After Life - dir. Kore-eda Hirokazu,"This is a sensitive film by a Japanese director on the subject of life and death. Its pace is gentle and contemplative, it is charmingly, sometimes playfully acted and envelopes the audience in an aura of peace and respect. Hirokazu examines the greatest mystery with which we all have to deal some time or other in our lives - what is death, and consequently what is life and what is the value of life, or rather each of our own lives? There is no overt influence of religion, philosophy or other grand ideas or theories, rather we are left to draw our own conclusions based on the experiences of real people which are presented to us.Because of the occasional almost banal nature of stories related by certain of the protagonists I got the impression that the film had a tendency to meander, but this hardly detracted from depth of thought behind the ideas and the sincerity of the acting."
5,Probably one of the best movies I've ever seen,It's filmed in such a realistic and thought-out fashion. It's especially touching how Kore-Eda deals with how we see ourselves through memories and how that can change from moment-to-moment. I loved this much more than Kore-Eda's first movie Maborosi.
5,must see/ must share,"Part of the beauty of this film is that it is Japanese. Part of the beauty of this film is that it is not religious. It is about life. It is about memories. It is about people.If you can watch one movie that brings all of us together as one people, it is this. Regardless of your ethnic origins, we share the same emotions, the same feelings, the same thoughts, dreams, wishes, hurts and fears.Having lived in Japan for the better part of 11 years, part of the fun of watching the movie was listening to the Japanese while reading the subtitles. Our reactions to other people are the same, regardless of what language we speak.A video I would love to give to all my friends and relatives. And then discuss at the next family reunion!!!"
5,Must see,"I would have to rank After Life up with Life is Beautiful, Wings of Desire, and Seventh Seal, as my favorite foreign films of all time. Anyone who won't watch foreign films just because of subtitles is missing the movie watching experience of a life time. The movie is well put thought out, wonderfully filmed, and with enough quirks to endear it to the viewer. Definitely a must see for fans of foreign. I am glad to hear that this is finally getting released"
1,Something's wrong,"I love this movie and really wanted to own the dvd to watch it with friends. But the sub-titles are all cut off at the bottom! I know what's going on so I can decipher it, but no-one else can stand to watch the thing! I'm very disappointed."
3,After life -- overrated!,"I have seen plenty of japanese films which I thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunatly, After Life was not one of those.After you get over the unique plot, we have very few surprises, you will actually look forward to the end of the film. To me, this film had lots of potential but in the final analysis, they blew it."
5,Not to be missed,"This has become one of my favorite films. Just when you think the film is about to end, it goes in a surprising direction and touches you even more deeply. You leave this film with a renewed appreciation for life and those you love. It is absolutely beautiful and very moving. I can't praise this enough. See it."
4,One single memory,"""After Life"" opens up to things that some of us may wonder about. The movie is truely magical. ""Where do we go when we die?"" The fact of being able to take something precious w/ you to the other side to cherish alway is a comforting feeling. This movie gives the whole idea of death a different meaning. The stories are very moving. Every story is unique and beautiful in its own way. It's a movie that should not be missed."
4,Interesting,"This movie makes you think about those magical moments in life (sometimes too short in time but extraordinary powerfuls) in which one is actually shaked, amused, amazed, impressed, joyed, by something or someone. The best part is that what is most important to you is very unique htat not even your wife or best friend can match because they have their own,,,,this made me think a lot about the loneliness of the human spirit."
4,"nice product, fast shipment","good product, very quick ship. Now if someone could just come up with a filter that would last longer--where is the 6-month filter?"
1,What does this cartrige fit????,Your site tells me very little of this cartrige and what models it fits as far as filter replacement. Can you update your website to give me more information?
1,Makes Water Taste Like Charcoal,"I wanted to try this filter to see if it would help with the not so pleasant odor sometimes present in our well water. I've had the filter in my whole house filtration system for three full days now, and while the smell is gone, the water tastes like charcoal. It's undrinkable- I will be ordering another filter ASAP."
3,Take a Unique World Tour,"Wow, what an exciting read of African and Amazon stories for readers of all ages! There were creepy and eerie tales, funny, and sad ones too. Don't overlook the Crocs and the Safari Ants or you will be sorry - literally. A real roller coaster ride with great pictures to accompany the saga of this author.If you want to take an unusual world tour right from the comfort of your own home, grab a copy of this book now.~ Brenda Nixon, author of Parenting Power in the Early Years and The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"
4,Superb blend of memoir and myth....,"Though a series of short, engaging chapters, A Touch of Africa chronicles Bert D'Amico's adventures, first in Africa, then in the Amazon Jungle. But the book is more than simply an interesting memoir, as D'Amico blends in discussions of mythology, anthropology and even theories of animal behaviour into his storytelling. If you enjoy National Geographic and the Discovery Channel, then you will find this book a truly enjoyable read!"
5,DATED!?!??!?!,"To the fools who think this album is dated, you don't know what hip hop is supposed to be. This album is what we've been missing, produced by Erick Sermon and you trying to say this isn't fire!???we need more albums like this and like Redman's Red Gone Wild. Half the other releases these days are novelty albums. Like the album son you got a fear of real hip hop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome,"I actually liked the cut in sequences mentioned in the previous review.. having not being to a poncho concert or being too familiar with him, it gives you that little extra between songs letting you understand the musician behind the music.besides that the quality of music and video are awesome, you turn up the volume on a good home theater and really get involved by it.highly recommended!"
4,My daughter loves this video,"We watched this video before Halloween and she pulled out her little notebook and started writing down everything Santa told her. Then she asked, ""Can we watch it again when Christmas comes?"" The short segments are perfect for winding rambunctious children down during the excitement of the holidays."
2,Major Caveat,"While I am very impressed with the author's modeling skills, patience and abilities, I am disappointed in the book from the standpoint of someone wanting to learn modeling technique. I will never in several liftimes be able to duplicate the work shown in the book and the book does very little to encourage or improve my meager modeling skills. This is not a ""How To"" book other than for, perhaps, a very elite range of extremely skilled people."
3,OK if you don't want much heat for your dog,This product has very little heat output and if the cover is on there is no heat what so ever.....I had to take the cover off so that my dog would get the heat. It does however get them off the cold ground but if this was the goal I could have bought a cheap blanket.... The heat is not throughout the mat as well it is only in certian places so you have a 12.5x18.5 pad with heat in about 9 square inches of the mat.
3,Functions well but both cracked,Works as advertised but both cracked in one season. Still works but certainly not waterproof anymore. Shock risk?!
4,Great for cats too!,"We bought 2 of the small lectro-kennel heating pads last year and they were so great that we bought another one this winter, a medium-sized one. None have quit so far. We bought these for our cats, who love them. We have 2 feral cats who won't live in the house. This is perfect for them in the cold winter. The other heating pad is used inside for our older cat who has arthritis. I highly recommend them. The only downside is the price, but there are cheaper prices out there if you look around."
1,Product is faulty x 2,"I received 2 K&H Lectro Kennel 2 days ago and put them through some testing. The product heated in different areas correctly not as one temp setting on all areas and in other areas NOT SO MUCH, meaning both did not warm to specifications. I also put weight on both as a test to see if it heated to 103 degrees as the product states, and it does not. I am very disappointed, and have 5 puppies due in a few days. I will have to keep a CLOSE eye on these products and I will not endorse them to anyone."
3,I really needed this to work...,"However after 2-3 weeks I needed to exchange it because it stopped working. The second has been working but, again, it's only been a few weeks. The concept is good...I hope the product lasts this time."
1,not worth the money,"I purchased this item in good faith.My dog tore it up the first night that it was used.Needless to say we had to bring himm inside,so I really don't knowif it works good.It is supposed to be strong."
2,lectro kennel heating pad,"doesn't work as advertised.....thought this would be great for our kennels, but it produces little heat. i will try to figure out something to use it with and get some good out of it."
1,K&H Lectro Kennel heated pad,"The unit worked only two nights and then stopped. Also the pad is a hard plastic case with a thin fleece covering. It can't be very comfortable, especially for older dogs."
2,dogs don't like it.,We have two dogs and when it's cold outside they do not want to use the lectro mats at all. They look at it if something is making noise and prefer to sleep on the cold ground instead of the mats...I used some force (on the dogs) but it's not working.. One time one mat was overheating on one spot...
1,Overheated,"Purchased June 6th. Realized today Jan 2nd the cats haven't been using it for days...I picked it up and it's searing hot and smells like melting plastic. It definitely would have injured them if trapped in a kennel with this thing when it failed. They loved it when it worked properly but has failed in about 6 months. I've had a different model 3093, which appears the same only smaller, for about 16 months and it seems to still be working perfectly."
4,Lectro-Kennel Heat Pad 22.5x28.5 In S,"product works as advertised, but is fragile. it arrived damaged. if it were tougher to crack i would have given it a higher mark."
5,My beagles love it!,I had one in my beagles' house for the last 5 years. It has kept them warm in 10 degree weather. I ordered a new one when they finally scratched through the plastic covering. Works very well. I did have to take off the front of their doghouse to get the pad in because it was too big to fit through the door but that was no problem.
1,BURNED UP IN THE KENNEL AND MELTED,BOUGHT ONE OF THESE LARGE ELECTRIC PADS FOR OUR OUTSIDE DOG TO STAY WARM IN HIS KENNEL. AFTER I PLUGGED IT IN I THOUGHT THE DOG WOULD BE NICE AND COZY FOR THE 3 TO 4 COLD MONTHS. I FIGURED OUT WHY HE PAWED THE DOOR TO COME IN WHEN IT WAS FREEZING...AT THE BEGINNING OF SPRING I CLEANED OUT THE KENNEL...WHOAAA!!!!!!!!!!!...THE PAD HAD MELTED AND BURNED INTO THE KENNEL FLOOR. COULD HAVE BURNED UP THE DECK CORNER WHERE THE KENNEL IT BUT LUCKILY IT DIDN'T.I THREW THE PAD AWAY BUT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PHOTOS AND POSTED THEM TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT IS BEING PUT OUT THAT IS DANGEROUS TO PETS AND/OR HOMES TOO!!!
2,Two barks,My dog likes comfort and takes a cold pillow over a hard heated slab. It may be nice for smaller dogs but a great dane likes cushions with his heart.
5,Wisconsin Winters,"I purchased 2 of the large K & H Heat Pads to put inside my dog cottage with a attached outdoor kennel. My two collies are outside in the kennel during the day & indoors with us at night. I have the pads on timer switches to go on in the AM before I leave for work & off when I arrive home in the evening. The dogs have the option stay outside in the kennel to go in the cottage and lay on their pads during the day. I do check every AM to make sure the pads are warm before I leave for work. When I come home they seem happy & warm. At this point I am very happy with my purchase. I like the fact that they are hard plastic, washable, and the cord has protection from chewing."
5,"Works great, keeps our little dog toasty warm in her house","Great product, arrived promptly, works perfectly in the doghouse to keep our dog warm if we are gone and she is outside."
2,"Felt mislead, ended up having to throw away","I purchased this last year for a boxer puppy we were housebreaking. I kept the kennel in the garage so she wasn't exposed to direct wind, but boxers have no cold tolerance so she just needed something to keep warm. She was rarely ever in it since someone is almost always home, but it only took her about 5 or 6 times in the kennel to chew the wire to the point where it doesn't work (and remember, she's a puppy). The coil is very loosly wound around the cord and there is nothing keeping it tight against the end where the wire goes in to the pad. It took her nothing to move the coil enough to get the wire. I am just glad she didn't shock herself. I was going to return it for a refund, but my husband threw the box away so it just became more of a hassle than anything. I wish someone would make a dog kennel with a heated bottom. Would have solved all my problems. Wouldn't spend the money unless you KNOW FOR SURE your dog won't try to chew the wire."
4,It keeps out pooch warm on cold winter days,Our dog is made to spend time outside when my wife and I are not home and the Lecto-Kennel allows her to stay nice in cozy warm in her doghouse even on the coldest days. I highly recommend the product.
2,"Works, but only for a short while.","I have bought 20 or so of these pads for my kennel over the last 3 winters. They work fine for about 3 or 4 months then just quit working. They are on about 10 hours a day, 3 months out of the year. Problem is that it is in the first few months of the second season that they quit heating, right after warranty expires. Just replaced 8 out of 10 that was purchased last year. The manufactured dates on those were 7/2011 and 7/2011. Very expensive for an item that is so unreliable. Really wish they would work on the quality. Going to try the Kane Poly Pet Dog Heating Mats as these Lectro-Kennel Heat Pads burn out."
5,Love this Heating Pad,I have several feral cats that come onto my patio to eat. This year I decided to try and help them through the winter by covering my patio chair with plastic and putting a heating pad underneath. I have seen as many as 4 of them under there keeping warm on the pad. They are very thankful for this product as am I. I was afraid that it would raise my electric bill being on constantly but it only went up $10. A friend had a smaller verion so I searched for it and found that there were larger sizes. The larger size is great for a large pet or several small ones.
3,Thin but washable,"We haven't used the fleece cover much, but the Lectro Kennel Heated Mat itself is wonderful. Our outdoor dog and cat love the mat. Our dog was developing bad arthritis, but since using the heated mat, it's gone away. It worked so well for her last winter, we purchased a 2nd as emergency backup. Very durable thick, hard plastic, but just in case, we keep it out of south sun so it doesn't warp/crack. The fleece cover isn't very thick, so we use a washable throw rug instead. The soft rubberized backing keeps it in place nicely. You're not supposed to use anything except the fleece cover, though. Fire hazard, etc.K&H; Lectro Kennel with Free Fleece Cover, Large"
2,K & H Lecro Kennel doesn't last,"I bought 6 of these pads for my cattery. They worked fine for about 1/2 of a season, but then 4/6 quit working. Very expensive for an item that lasts only a few months. Unfortunately, there are no other similar products out there that might be more reliable, so I, like so many others, will have to buy some more. Without competition, there is no impetus for the company to improve their product."
2,BEWARE!,"After using these for a number of years with great results, I must downgrade my opinion of this product from 5 stars to 2. Recently I checked on a mat used safely and successfully for the past 3 winters. Under 4 inches of straw, the temperature of the mat almost burned my hand! (That explains why the dog had been sleeping outside her cubby in the 20-degree cold.) It could have ignited the entire wooden shed. A puppy, injured or debilitated dog may not have moved but instead suffered burns. THIS PRODUCT CANNOT BE TRUSTED. If you must use due to the economy of it, check it constantly."
1,Warning ...they almost killed my friend's dog,"Never deal with this horrible outfit. We just watched our best friends endure the most horrible tragedy with the most adorable sweet puppy dog in the world. The dog suffered 3rd degree burns and almost died from these inferior products. Every day the poor dog in agony had to endure vet visits and have the scabs from the open wounds scrapped off to prevent infection and then treated and wrapped with gauze and a gel pack. This agony and torture went on for 8 weeks. NOW the totally cruel and unconscious people at the K and H company including the president and customer service employees are uncaring, self protective, rude and deliberately threw out the heating pad so they could not be sued or held accountable. Such inhumane people!!! These people should be reported. We will report to the CPSC immediately."
4,good for cold days,I purchased this product and my two bulldogs at the cold days stayed in their house all day!!!The only problem is that the cords protection is not much protective. after three days i found that my dogs chew the cord. the cord protection did nothing at all. hopefully it was not pluged when they chew it.
4,Older dog loves it,I bought this when the weather in Central TX was dipping into the teens. I have two outside dogs that spend their evenings in the garage. My Border Collie who is 11 years old loves it and won't let the Chow on it!
3,A bit of Heat for the Pets,"I probably didn't use this in the proper fashion, i.e. in a dog's kennel, but I was not particularly impressed with the functionality. The fleece cover is nice, thin, and doesn't really disguise the hardness of the mat. The instructions say to not cover the mat with anything else, so my pets never liked the beds much. I used them on a southern porch, and put them on top of their raised sling beds; they didn't feel warm unless they were in the sun."
4,smaller than expected,This product is wonderful and my St.Bernard loves it. I just feel like it not big enough to be called large. But it's better than nothing at all out in the cold.
5,Dog Bed Heater - great product!,"I have three dogs. My dog Bosco wasn't quite sure he wanted to jump into his dog house the morning after we put the heated pad in, but soon discovered the benefits of having a warming pad inside his dog house. It's been in the negative numbers the past couple of days and the dogs come out of the house, eat as fast as they can and jump into their dog houses to hang out on their heating pads. These are a great invention and I can't say enough good things about them. Thank you so very much!"
1,deep sleep & relaxation dvd,"waste of money laid awake waiting for results staring at screen, dvd was purchased based on other written reviews, feel free to purchase this dvd as long as you are willing to stare at plants, waterfalls and sheep."
3,"A new, but sort of same hunting game.","I enjoyed this game at some points and disliked it at some points. I love the different types of hunting that you are able to do, but it was sort of the same ol' hunting game. I did like playing it though, I killed a bigger deer on this game than any other. The graphics were very good also."
4,A timely piece of information,For years I have been hearing about aromatherapy but very little how-to or what works and why. I am delighted to finally find a book that includes answers to questions I had in a format that is easy to access. I have begun using some of the techniques Ms. Eidson relates in her book and have seen some amazing transformations in my life and in my family's. These changes range from direct health benefits to healing parts of my past I thought were forever to haunt me. My gratitude to Ms Eidson for getting into print such valuable information.
1,I hate to rain on the parade.....,"In spite of her substantial bibliography I can't understand where Eidson got some her information. Her vibrational conclusions have nothing to do really, with the functions of many of the oil themselves or their history. It has been my experience, so far, that any oil supports it's healing function from the most basic physical levels to the deeper and more subtle purposes. Edison entirely skips the history and physical uses of each oil, missing the chance to dove tail all the information into a more comprehensive bundle. I don't know if she thought that the conventional stuff had already been done or that none of it was germane. Now later, I may be proven wrong as I learn more, but then there's the matter of the price. This is way too expensive given that the information may be personal to just Eidson. I was really disappointed. A much better value though he only covers 37 oils is Gabriel Mojay's ""Healing the Spirit."""
2,Arbitrary Interpretations,"In an earlier review, Astat wondered about Deborah's vibrational conclusions. This struck a cord for me as well. As presented, the conclusions seemed somewhat arbitrary.Even though the subject is vibrational healing perhaps there is still a need for presenting some mundane information to create a sense of connection or continuity?I did not strongly identify with all the interpretations, wanted a little more wooing down the path that Deborah trod."
5,"Great Fun, Entertaining and Educational!","This game is noted to be for ages 3-8 but as an adult I have to admit that I am enthralled with it. The game is never the same twice so you have to really go on a treasure hunt and while the amount of information given about the different time periods is limited the game forces you to put aside things you may need in your quest and think ahead to how they might be used to retrieve different objects for barter and exchange. While this sounds too advanced for most 3 year olds it keeps them stimulated plus has game times interjected into the action for pure amusement. There is even a virtual ""racquetball"" court! Really, really valuable addition to our family pasttimes!"
3,Minor of a great series,"Putt-Putt Travels Through Time is part of the Putt-Putt series, the most exciting strategy computer games for kids aging 2+ (yes, it is right, 2+).Not as charming as Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo and Putt-Putt Enters the Race, and more stimulating than Putt-Putt Joins the Circus, Putt-Putt Travels Through Time is still an amazing way to introduce your kids to computers in a positive and creative way.My kid loved it, played with it hundreds of times and learned a lot with it. It is a good pick to extend your collection."
5,"Lots of substance, little context","This book presents basic religious texts of a variety of religions, eastern and western, with a more or less objective presentation. However, I found the introductory materials for each religion to be overly academic at times, sometimes raising as many questions as it answered. If you're looking for an entry-level survey of what the world's religions believe -- an interpretation of the doctrines these scriptures lay out -- this may not be the best resource available.I suspect this would make a fine textbook for a college-level survey of world religions, though I was familiar with several of them by the time I found this book. The layperson, looking for an introduction to what Buddhists, Muslims, or the Shinto actually believe, may be left scratching his or her head."
4,Swinging Quintet,"Contrary to to product description, there are no guests on this very well recorded studio session from 1956. Zoot on tenor, Jon Eardley trumpet and a rhythm section led by pianist Henry Renaud. One of Zoot's best."
5,GIFT for AUNTIE,Beautiful words - brilliantly matted - LOOKS very nice! LOVELY - LOOKS AWESOME! Definitely recommend to anyone wishing to buy their special aunt something to let her know how much you care.
5,A Unique Read!,"It says a lot when the introduction to a book is so interesting that one would go back and eagerly re-read it after finishing the book! Or is it that after reading the stories, I wanted more? Probably both. I've already read Brooklyn Family Scenes, which was fantastic, and now I can't wait to get my hands on Scalia's two novels. No Strings Attached was probably the most varied collection of stories I've ever read. Absolutely unique. Scalia's stories paint pictures in your mind. I was able to see all of his scenes, characters, and even feel their emotion. Each story gripped me. Scalia is absolutely fantastic."
5,Salsa Lover's Delight,"Going back thirty five years with this c.d., we know why ""El Gran Combo"" rules unchallenged. This is a compilation of their most unforgettable music of the last century.Tehy are truly an institution. It's difficult to choose one particular best. You will play this set over and over as your body girates to the rythm that made ""salsa"" great.If you like ""Salsa"" then this C.D. set is a must. You will love all thirty four songs.Viva el Gran Combo."
2,Game and graphics are way to old and tired,I bought this game hoping to improve my dove hunting skills. This game's graphics and gameplay were probably old and outdated when it came out. It is certainly hard to look at and play in today's world.
4,Not sure what the other reviewer is talking about....,I am a teacher and hesitated about purchasing this video after reading the review posted. I decided to purchase despite the review and am very glad I did. The video was energetic and captured the attention of my class. The accompanying workbook was very helpful in planning and promoting a business for young people. Because the video featured young people that had started their own business my class decided to start a business as a class project! This video also discussed saving and investing money which is very important to business longevity.
4,Awesome,This game is awesome the music has lyrics and is good to. It is even XP compatible the only flaw the graphics arent so great but this game rocks.
5,Fantastic,"I know this game is old, but it is so much fun!The music is catchy, addictive gameplay.I have so many fond memories with this game and everyone should buy it!Also probably a less buggy version is on sonic gems collection for the gamecube!"
4,good and great,"i got this with no idea whith sonic and could not play it due to system requierments but once i got it working it was great! it has huge courses, total control, and the best music on the planet because the music has words! try to get it for saturn because i heard it was beter but the PC is the only one i played because i got it when N64 was popular. the only reason i did not give it 5 is because the controls do not work well on PC but all in all i love this game sssssssssoooooooo much that one day i spent 5 hours playing it!"
5,"Just ""WOW""","You know, when I first picked up this game, when I was about 2 years old, I was a die-hard fan, and to this day, at 13, I still am. I found this game last month, layered in dust, because I was going through ""Sonic Withdrawl"", and remembered how hard it was when I was 2. I hesitated at first but decided to play it again. I was blown away! With an unlockable course and 6 unlockable characters, I could'nt put it down! I already beat it and unlocked Super Sonic O.O.This game is a MUST MUST MUST get for your Sonic die-hard fan!!!The graphics... not exactly ""awesome"" but it was great for the time!But either way; this is the ultimate Sonic PC game I've ever played.And, if you want to give your child a ""Sonic Holiday"" I stongly suggest you buy Sonic CD, also, BUT Sonic CD is NOT comatible with Windows XP! (Trust me: I've tried)"
3,toyota,"is small car I dont recomend for kids just for people take care about stuff is not for play, only decoration"
1,solitaire,this product would not download to my laptop and desktop. I keep getting a popup saying ppcload.dll was not installed on my computers.
1,You get what you pay for,It worked about 3 times but then fell apart. The case came open and a wire came disconnected.
4,"Great Book, Get this if like history or sociology,","This is such a great history of New York, it has both a very wide scope as well some depth. And it Reads Really Well. This is not your average borring cultural history that just lists facts there is a story here."
5,Beautiful entertainment for everyone in the fam,"My son asked for these when we borrowed them from the library so many times we just bought them :) They are really interesting - the songs/dances are just long enough to hold a young child's attention (he's been watching them since he was about 18 months and is now 3) but interesting enough (not pretentious or *eagerly educational*) to watch repeatedly. I also like how they use real instruments and real recordings rather than music box sounds. I ALSO appreciate that they added some jazz and a little ""mambo"" in there, since classical is not the only valid musical style in the world :) Definitely worth a buy or at least borrowing from the library, if you can do so :)"
5,Classical Baby,"This is a bright, colorful DVD with beautiful music. My daughter, who is 13 months old, gets excited to watch it each time I put it on."
3,She Loves to Dance,My 4 yr old loves to dance. It's nice to show her different music and dance styles.
1,You could do better,"If you want to teach your baby about music,there are so many educational DVDs out there for babies, toddlers, and preschoolers, that totally entertain them at the same time. This just does not provide much for young viewers to process. My favorite (and my kids') DVD by far is Trebellina, which teaches real musical concepts (like how to read music, rhythm, instruments, etc) in a very young-child friendly way."
2,Not too thrilled.,"This was not a big hit with my 14 and 32 month old children. I was pretty disappointed in it myself. I thought it would have a bit more realistic dancing in it, but it mainly shows drawn cartoon figures moving around. My kids both love music and dancing, but this didn't hold their attention. I personally think the Playschool Prep series is better for capturing interest."
2,sorry guys..,"sorry but I loved the first album, couldnt wait for the new one, but was disapointed when I finally got it. The first album was catchy, rockin, and grooving, while some tracks were simplistic and aestetic, some insanely complexe and very interesting. This new album is polor opposite. slow, not very toe tapping at all. Out of 7 songs i would only say 2 or (maybe) three tracks are worthy of purchase. the first track has some AWESOME bass work, and the 4th track is cool in its minimalist/indie vibe. Im putting this album into permanent light rotation in my collection. disapointed, but the first album nearly makes up for it. Save your money. has anyone read the book called ""the shipping news""? thanks for listening, rock on."
5,Great Timer and Watch,"I frequently take this with me around my neck when I work or when I travel. It is easy to see the time at a glance. It is also great for timing cooking when I am involved in a recipe. However, when the battery went dead, I had to remove all the screws in the back to replace it. This is difficult for me because the buttons come off easily and I can never get them in place exactly right. I guess my hand shakes too much and it might be advisable in this situation to ask a jeweler. But other than the difficulty in changing batteries without three grey buttons falling off, I loved the stopwatch."
4,Good information,"As a forensic accountant in divorce litigation, I find this book helpful. However, some of the content is a little basic for my personal needs, but good nonetheless."
4,Fun and Murder with the Tatum Twins,"Bert and Nan are at it again, mixed up in murder and trying to earn a living. These twins make the mystery more interesting by being up to their noses in suspicion.A charming read, a few good chuckles, and a killer stalked by the daring duo. What more could we ask? It's a good book for a relaxing evening."
2,"sounds dull and like pop songs you already heard again,again",I loved Becker's songs that I heard on The wow albums. But I found this cd disapointing. The songs were dull/ bublegummish. The messages about God were great. But for better music with a more interesting sound I like Amy Grant's behind the eyes and Wow 96 and 97 better
5,THE VIEWTIFUL HERO,"THIS IS A FUN AND FULL OF ACTION GAME. IT IS VERY FUNNY. IF YOU HAD A HARD DAY AT WORK, THIS WILL HAVE YOU HOLLERING. I GOT THIS FOR MY SON, HE LOVES IT."
3,Viewtiful Joe.... . this did say 2 right ?,"I really loved the original Viewtiful Joe. I was expecting to be blown away by VJ-2. Am I ....no. The game isn't bad. It just feels more like more VJ than a new game. Sylvia is added, and a new VFX move for her to use, but thats about it. Different story, but story definately is NOT VJ's strongpoint. I feel bad, its all my fault. Capcom decided to make a lil extra money and I fell for it. C'mon Capcom, u could've at least warned us. Should've called it ""Viewtiful Joe - The Deleted Scenes"" or ""Viewtiful Joe Xtreme"" Koei knows what I'm talking about. I gave it 3 stars cause its just like the first game. But the first was a 4-5 star game so ......"
2,Not as good as the Man,"King Alan is my favorite man in Washington. I know I am not alone here. But this book was not what I had hoped it would be. There are a lot of quotes and brief comments on each. Most of the book is about regulations and banking, not on the markets. In a couple of months the market information will be outdated. There is some interesting insite into the 1998 crisis, but that only covers a few pages. The juicy quotes are pretty far between. I did not learn too much about Greenspan or his effect here."
3,Words move Mountains,"A single man's words can move the greatest nation in the world. Sicilia and Cruikshank portray Alan Greenspan as one of the most powerful men in society today, while also showing him as a simple and honest man. The power held by Greenspan's words not only move a nation, they move the world as he moves the dollar.The book itself is a decent enough review of Alan Greenspan's economic career, from its inception at Townsend-Greenspan & Co. until his illustrious tenure as chairman of the Fed. Complete with speeches Greenspan himself gave, along with commentary by Sicilia and Cruikshank, this book helps to explain the economic trends of the past decade and put into perspective the exact role that Greenspan played in those trends.Honestly, the book itself became a little tired. The format of teh book rarely changes, and, as a high school student, I found myself scrying for ways to keep myself awake during the reading. Recommended if you really like economics or Alan Greenspan."
2,Do you really get what you pay for?,These sheets are awfully thin and see through for supposedly being 1000 thread count.This is the second time I tried purchasing 1000 thread count sheets and was disappointed.
2,Not for elementary classes,Too advanced for daily sixth grade assignments. Really does not give variety of synonyms or any antonyms for use with homework.
1,"""colloquial and slang terms"" are inappropriate for children","I got this thesaurus for my school age children, but it isn't appropriate for them. It includes two full pages of very descriptive terminology for the word ""sex"" and includes foul language and all of their variations when you look up such words. Not a great reference for children."
4,Roget's Thesaurus in Dictionary Form,I find this reference book most helpful due to the fact that it incorporates the style of a dictionary. It provides abundant information for words which assist me in utilizing them in numerous formats. I recommend this item with confidence to anyone who wishes to improve their writing skills.
4,:),"Well packed, quick delivery. This text really helps with wording on my class papers. If you get stuck or just want to check out something that is a bit different."
5,N,"Very nice, up to date! I've used this a handful of times thus far and it's easy to navigate through."
5,The Best Baseball Sim On The Market!,"Alright, so I AM a stats addict...That being said, I've still got to say that I have never, and I mean NEVER, seen a baseball sim as realistic and enjoyable as this one. If you like arcade style games, you'll hate BM. It has no graphics to speak of, no contol over the actual game play. You take on the role of the General Manager of the team, making trades and payroll decisions, moving players in and out of the lineup... yadda yadda. It's a phenomenal game if you like the strategy of running a team. It's terrible if you want to manage a baseball *game*."
3,"Good, but... Incomplete","When I first saw Mongle on Amazon[com.]..., I thought it was the perfect game for me and bought it right away. I always perferd the number crunching, lets make deal, front office play, but Baseball Mongle takes it too far. I enjoyed the game for a couple of weeks but it got annoying having the vowles in the players names mixed up to avoid a law suit from the players assoceation and fixing them took to much time and fo[r]..ced you to cheat using commisioner mode. The game has alot of good points like the addition of meadia,buget whitch has to include scouting Med. staff and farm system and an accurate sim* But soon the drawbacks catch up with you: There is no ""real playing"" mode in the game; it's all sims, this puts the playoffs almost completely out of your hands witch is annoying since your playoff perfomince is what the game juges you on. So in inclution, the game is fun for awhile but the gaps get annoying fast, still, for 15 bucks it's worth it."
1,Una Cara Bonita,I think that the Cd would have actually been great if Frankie Ruiz was in it. Actually I think you guys commited a mistake because the interpreter of this song is Viti Ruiz( Frankie's Brother) who has too little talent to be compared with the inmortal Frankie. That would be my review on this album. Make sure that you are selling what is being advertised. Thank You! Carlos Adorno
3,Inconsistent Performance,"It seems like I can't get both the hard drive and the built in USB hub to function consistently at the same time. I have it plugged into an Apple Airport Extreme so that I can have access to the drive on my network and have a couple of printers and another external drive also available. At times, all of this functions very well. At other times, only the main drive is accessible while the peripherals are not. Other times, I can print wirelessly but can't access the drive. I've tested each peripheral by itself directly plugged into the Airport, and they all function consistently. I think the LaCie drive/USB hub just isn't perfectly designed."
5,LaCie 250 GB Mini External Hard Drive and Hub,Good product at a reasonable price. Found it for a couple of dollars less but the no hassle of buying from Amazon made it an easy choice. Unit works well. We partitioned it to do back up plus 125 GB if additional storage space on my wife's Mini
1,Eratic Behavior,"This product has the potential to be a very useful means of backup and storage for large amounts of data, music, and photos. However, I have found the performance of the hard drive to be very erratic. Sometimes it will mount on the Mac Mini desktop, and sometimes it will not. Sometimes it will simply disappear after mounting. The Mac Mini System Profiler will sometimes recognize the device as a LaCie drive, even though the drive does not mount. Other times, it will see only an ""Unknown Device."" At all times however, the product performs properly as a hub, both for Firewire and USB devices. The lack of operating consistency is a very serious shortcoming and a source of much frustration. I do not recommend this product."
3,o.k belt,product comes as advertised but it just wasn't for me. After giving it a couple of weeks i just bought an occidential leather and was never happier
2,Does not include line numbers or Italian text.,The Kindle Edition does not include numbering for the poem's lines. This effectively blocks the needed linkage of the analytic notes to the text.The edition also lacks facing-page Italian text.These flaws critically limit the usefulness of this otherwise excellent translation and commentary.
5,sweet,Got my book a week before school started. Thanks for saving me $60 for a book in mint condition. would definetly by from you again. Thanks.
4,Used book,The book was in good condition other than a huge piece of tape on the front cover that wasn't disclosed.
1,not for mac,As a child I loved this game. after hours of searching on line for a place where i could buy or download this game for mac i found amazon had this game under the platform for mac and pc. after it arrived at my house and set up on my computer it tells me that this game is not compatible with the mac operating system. i highly recommend this game but not if you have a mac.
4,Dakota K&N 77-1546KP Performance Air Intake Kit,"This intake is good, I did notice an increase in power and fuel economy with it. Installation was a breeze and took about 45 minutes. I did a little modification to make this a TRUE cold air kit by routing the intake through the hole in the fender and behind the stock fog light. I will try and post some pictures on [...]-Justin-"
5,great season,Return to Cranford continued to be superb. The acting was enjoyable as well as the story line. I loved the setting and costumes.
5,Luv Luv Luv'd it!,"Who doesnt Love Judi Dench? This was a wonderful series-it had me totally addicted from the first episode right thru this Special episode. It really put the finishing touches on ""how things turned out"". I'm ready for a sequel!"
1,Can't be seen on standard U.S. blu-ray players,"After enjoying the first Cranford so much, I was very excited to have another opportunity to visit with the ladies. Imagine my disappointment when I received the blu-ray disc only to find out it cannot be viewed on standard U.S. blu-ray players because it's an import. This disc is more expensive than others (approx. $52) and since it's been opened, it cannot be returned. Will I buy it if it ever comes out in a U.S. format, probably, but I'm very disappointed that neither the disc nor Amazon.com made it clear that it would not play in the U.S. unless I had special equipment. Before purchasing this disc, be very sure you have the proper equipment to view it."
2,Disappointing,"After thoroughly enjoying Cranford, I was quite disappointed with the Return to Cranford. There was too many drastic changes, too many added new characters and not enough of first cast. The story jumped ahead too far and I just felt lost and couldn't get into it."
2,A Huge Disappointment,"After thoroughly enjoying the first Cranford with all its charm and appeal, this subsequent series was a great disappointment. With its splendid pedigree of actors retained, there is no lack of effort on their part but even the excellent cast cannot not fix a script/direction that is sorely lacking in most all aspects and one which renders every situation as contrived and insipid. It would have been wonderful to experience a continuation of all the heartwarming aspects of the first series but this particular rendition falls dismally short."
3,"Good show, unless you compare to original Cranford","The original Cranford made me laugh and cry. I was attached to the characters, and they were very believable. This follow-on was a little silly. The new characters were too contrived. There were too many jokes from the original that kinda fell flat. Things moved too fast to be enjoyed.My feeling is that it is a very mediocre sequel to a fantastic original."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I only saw the first presentation on PBS and I am disappointed. I loved ""Cranford"" and I wish that many more of the original cast were kept in the ""Return."" Why was it necessary to lose Dr. Harrison and his new bride and leave Cranford with no doctor at all (hence the death of Martha). A different actor for Matty's brother - Mary Smith's lack of eye glasses - and so many references to things past we must read all the books for answers. What was Mary Smith's disappointment? Hopefully, Septimus will not win out in the end.But, I have pre-ordered the DVD and I am sure I will perhaps learn to like it."
1,Don't buy this item,"Return to Cranford will not play on my blu-ray player or on my neighbor's player. It was clearly pressed for British Commonwealth blu-ray players, not for North American players. This is the second time Amazon has been sloppy in its marketing and burned me, the first time was Miss Potter which also would not play on a U.S.-based blu-ray player. I was very disappointed as I was so looking forward to playing this disc. Cranford works just fine but not Return to Cranford. Amazon needs to be more careful in the discs it provides to its viewers."
1,Don't go!,"The original BBC TV production of ""Cranford,"" based on the book by E Gaskell, is charm itself. This later production is not based on any work by Gaskell and was created from thin air and that's about what it is worth. It is so poorly written that it ruins the memory of the original series. By all means, get the original ""Cranford,"" but avoid this ersatz aberration altogether!"
1,Cranford Return to Cranford,"I bought this particualr DVD not realising that it was zone 1, however have an American friend with a zone 1 DVD player and we started to watch it...the quality is truely terrible. The colours are dreadfully enhanced, the screen rolls..don't buy it. I have since however purchased a zone 2, and am now able to enjoy this delightful production. An evening in the company of the characters of Cranford is most pleasantly spent!"
2,CRANFORD; RETURN TO CRANFORD,"I WILL TELL YOU THE HONEST TRUTH ABOUT THE DVD RETURN TO CRANFORD, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, IT WAS LIKE THE FIRST PART OF CRANFORD WAS THE BIGINING AND THE END OF A MOVIE ALL BY IT'S SELF, THEN THERE CAME RETURN TO CRANFORD,, THERE WAS NO DOCTOR AT ALL,, IT SEEM LIKE THEY DIDNOT HAVE A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON, NO SENCE AT ALL,, PEOPLE WOULD JUST LEAVE AND YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM ,AND I DO LOVE BBC MOVIES I GAVE RETURN TO CRANFORD TWO STARS,, IT REALLY LEFT ME CONFUSED, AND THESE MOVIES ARE NOT CHEAP"
4,Very enjoyable.,I love period drama but only three episodes for the second series. Shame. Perfect Sunday evening viewing. Check out Larkrise to Candleford.
5,As good as the first,So good. I loved how the characters ended up. Such a beautifully done series. Sad to see it end. I started last night and finished this evening.
3,Return to Cranford? No Thanks...,"I'll be brief. While I loved the original production of CRANFORD, I couldn't get into RETURN TO CRANFORD because I never got past the fact that the actresses looked like frumpy women dressed in straight-off-the-rack period-piece costumes. In short, this seemed an inauthentic and uninspired production and a waste of exceptional talent. When I wish to return to Cranford, I'll watch the wonderful original, thank you very much."
5,Wonderful series,This was the last in the series. Wish it hadn't been cancelled. The characters are wonderful and the series was incredibly engaging. I will miss them. We need more like this!
5,An excellent continuation,"A wonderful continuation of the Cranford series. Most of the original cast has returned headlined by my personal favorite, Judi Dench. My only complaint concerns its length - it is much, much too short."
4,A satisfying conclusion,"Although it seemed very short compared to the original, Cranford: Return to Cranford provided a satisfying conclusion to the series. It tied up all the loose ends, and I am glad that I purchased it!"
2,A sad excuse for a sequel.....,"I was thoroughly enchanted by the original Cranford and, therefore, filled with happy anticipation for the sequel. What a disappointment it is: ridiculous plot lines, poor writing, choppy pacing, sloppy editing. It contains none of the substance or subtlety of the original and little of it's charm. The actors are the only pleasure yet they are given precious little to do...a waste of some considerable talent. While I can watch Cranford over and over (and have!), once was enough for the sequel. I couldn't help but feel cheated, I'm sorry to say."
2,Really wanted to like this,"I loved the original ""Cranford"" on Masterpiece Theatre and have read the book ""The Cranford Chronicles"" (which you should all read!). I have the dvd and have watched it often and find something new in it each time. The story ends with many story lines tied up but also, some options for future story lines as the characters age and grow. Brilliant story and cast. Then comes ""Return to Cranford"". I won't spoil the story for you but while beautiful to look at, the story is shallow and meaningless and except for a few moments, you really won't care (everyone is against the railroad but no one has ever RIDDEN a train, soooooo). Most of the original actors are there but it seemed to me it was done out of pity for those of us who loved the original and wouldn't want to see new people in these roles or (horrors!) for the money. Stick to the original and imagine the future."
2,Disappointment abounds,"After watching the first episodes of Cranford on PBS, I had to have the DVD as soon as it was released. Then, when I heard they were making a ""Return to Cranford"", I eagerly anticipated it. But, this is just one more example of a quickly thrown together (""lets capitalize on the success of the first with a sequel!"" thinking) and very, very disappointing ""return"". I wish I had never seen the sequel, and in fact, have completely forgotten the sequel and prefer my own imagination of how things turned out. I'm happier, and so are my imaginary residents of Cranford!"
4,I wanted lots more Cranford!,"I'm giving ""Return to Cranford"" 4 stars only because there's not enough visit on the DVD; even though it's quite long, I was left wanting 'more'. This visit to Cranford is just as wonderful as the first, it just needs to be longer!"
4,A must see if you like period British movies,"When I first saw Elizabeth Gaskill's Cranford, I fell in love with it. Return to Cranford is an extension of Cranford. Although not as intricately woven as Cranford, Return to Cranford was still a delight to watch. If you love period British movies, then this is a must for your collection."
3,"Personally, I prefer Downton Abbey","Let this act as my review for both seasons one and two.Don't get me wrong by the rating, Cranford is a charming miniseries with an excellent ensemble, and it's extremely humorous in more than a few instances. It's just that after hearing my mother rave about it for months, I expected something different when I finally sat down to watch it. Those interested in this series are likely to get what they're looking for, which makes it a worthwhile piece of entertainment for most, it's just not for me."
3,disappointment,I loved the original series.Some of this series was repeated from the first.I can say I was a little disappointed.Diane M.
4,Better than expected,"After reading the reviews, I decided against ordering the sequal. I had enjoyed Cranford so much, I was afraid the second story would not come near the first as it is with many attempts at sequals in other films.I decided, after some more thought, to order Return to Cranford based on the main female actors being in the same rolls and how much I have enjoyed the first movie. I would give the sequal a try. While I was initally a bit disappointed at some of the lack of characters from the first movie being involved and some of the storyline altered without a reasonable explaination and the change of a few of the actors in secondary roles.,I was, on the whole, very glad I had taken the chance. The cast did a fine job continueing with the new storyline and some great new charaters added made for as much interest and mystery and entertainment as I had hoped for."
3,A very good sequel to an exceptional series,"While I could not give this sequel the 4 or 5 stars of the original Cranford, it was still very entertaining and like visiting old neighbors that you haven't seen in several months! Miss Matty, Miss Pole, and the others were as wonderful as before, with the cast additions being a pleasant group. Missing were the really strong performances of Francesa Annis and Philip Glennister, as well as both 'doctors' from Cranford I.Imelda Staunton, Jim Carter and Julia McKenzie were back as well as the 'he's grown a foot taller!' young protege/beneficiary. Emma Fielding as still wonderful as well as Miss Galindo.Just about the most perfect cast you could want on all counts, with costumes, art direction and music just excellent.If you want to live a little while in 1800s rural Britain, Cranford and 'Return to Cranford' (AKA Cranford I and Cranford II) are for you."
1,Not what it pretends to be.,"This may be a great series, but we'll never know with this DVD. When we bought it there was no warning that this would not work in region 1 (one) DVD/Blu-ray players.After trying to watch it, I went back on and found the only place one can see it won't work in our region was in the small print of the ""Product Details"". The ""Format"" just says ""Imported"".All other DVDs/Blu-rays I've looked at buying, this information is right up front and easy to spot. Not in this case.So be warned. Be very careful when buying DVDs/Blu-rays from Amazon.com because they won't take it back if you open it."
4,Love Cranford and it's citizens,"I enjoyed this second of the Cranford (I hope there will be more) series. I must admit that I liked the first more. The characters are so endearing and loveable that I almost wish I was there with them. I did miss some of the actors that were in the first installment that were not in this one. But I was so happy that most the cast was present for ""Return to Cranford."" One cannot help but fall in love with these women as they deal with life changes and trials. Keep it coming."
4,Nice sequal but mising some depth,I agree with some of the reviewers who stated that is was a fairly good series but lacking in some things. Overall..I still enjoyed Cranford and look forward to the next release as I do love the characters...
