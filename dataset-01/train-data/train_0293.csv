3,You get what you pay for... a weak Bokken,"Sooooo... as the title says, you get what you pay for. Also, the bokken you receive don't look like what is in the picture. There are no hand guards, but I don't really care about that. There was a knot in the wood of my black bokken and upon minimal partner practice it broke a foot from the top of the blade. So now a have a practice bokken and a practice shoto/tanto combo. lol. Hopefully the other one doesn't break any time soon. I expect it to though. I'll order another single one for the hell of it and hope it doesn't have a knot. I don't feel like spending more than 20 on something I'm just practicing with."
5,Great bokens for the price paid,"It came in perfect conditions, the heavier its the black one, the natural wooden whas kind of white and its lighter but not fragile. They are a great deal for the amount paid. The handguard (tsuba) its made of plastic and its made for you to be able to remove it. The only thing it's that some times the handguard loosens in the white one, but its not that bad."
2,You get what you pay...,"The items arrived pretty quickly and I was excited to get them so soon. However, being used to fine worksmanship, I was pretty disappointed with these. Both bokkens have lateral curves to them that become distracting when you are at a guard stance. The manufacturer (Made in Taiwan) didn't sand the wood (oak) well before they painted/varnished it so it looks and feel pretty unfinished and the grains stand out. If you're a martial arts purist, don't get this. Pay more and get a better one or make your own. This is basically a curved stick... not that there's anything wrong with that for basic practice."
2,"Poor quality control, returned","The black one looked fine. The natural colored one had cracks on both ends. Some as wide as 1/4 inch. Both bokens were wrapped in hard plastic. I can tell from the way they are packaged that the damage did not come from shipping. So they probably decided that a split end boken (on both ends!) was okay to sell. Amazon really made return easy. Just click on return, and print out the return shipping label. Since this item can not be replaced, I had to return the set and order another one. I will post review when second set arrives."
2,"Poor Quality, badly sanded, badly varnished, moldy","Last year I bought a previous set of two training swords, and I thought I bought the same set again with this purchase. Unfortunately not. There were three problems: (1) they had been shrink-wrapped in plastic prematurely. When these arrived and I peeled the plastic off of them, one stunk from incompletely dried varnish or paint, and the other was covered in mold/mildew and also smelled. (2) They don't have wrapped handles. (3) They were poorly sanded and had a very rough feel to the hand. The one good thing I can say about them is that they were nicely weighted. Oh well, as another reviewer stated, ""you get what you pay for."""
2,Not What I Hoped For.....,"I ordered these swords because they looked cool, but up close, there nothing special. First, the swords came WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY late to the point I forgot that they were even shipping to me anymore. Second, they messed up my order by sending me 2 of some hybrid crappy sword between the two shown. Im almost positive that they are hollow and i garrentee that if i hit them against a solid surface with any force what so ever, they will shatter like a glass vase. Not impressed at all, the only good thing about them is that at a distance of about 10 feet, they look slightly intimidating. I wouldent buy these swords again if i could but then again i could have just been unlucky. That's all i have to say, unimpressed, see ya."
5,"Amazing! but,","These swords were amazing with the execption that one broke in the middle of training, the were both very solid but the natural colored one was of a weaker wood so it broke very easily, i would buy the black one again but not in a set."
5,Awesome Bokkens,"Shipping was FAST and both came in perfect condition. My wife and I will be practicing Aikido with them and this set is Perfect. The black one has a thinner grip and is lighter, awesome for her smaller hands. The natural wood Bokken is heavier, and I will be using it. I plan on ordering from Sword demon (Kenshin's reverse blade sword!)"
2,2/5,"Lasted a week or two. Then the ""hardwood"" proke on one made of pine. If you are going to by boken just go buy the polypropolene ones. They do not break and unless you are constant, heavy user you will be unlikely to get anything more than a few dents from impact. And even heavy users will only notice a small warp over time. The boken remains usable."
2,Not sure how this compares to others,"But i paid a hefty price just so i can take this to the PE exam. I looked up maybe 5-6 terms, i think that i only found 1.It is kinda nice that after every letter there is a few pages fileld with diagrams and drawings.But this is definately not worth the $160. It says 1500pages, but since the book is so small and the print so large, its really like (300-400) pages of a regular 11x8.5 textbook (maybe even less)At that price, i at least expected the definitions to have some detail on the processesso why did i give it a 2-star? Dunno, i try not to be too harsh"
2,This is not english.,I am an avionics student and we are studying this book and it is very hard to understand. Could someone answer some questions that I have?
1,This book is written in Latin,"I agree with Ryan Eggen's description of the book, especially since I am in his class. I, too, am an avionics student and this book is extremely hard to understand. I feel lucky if I can go one page without having problems understanding the text."
5,A masterpiece!,"Merleau-Ponty's masterpiece is really an exquisite piece of writing. I know from an excellent source that there is a new translation coming soon. The French to English translation was done by a French professor, not a philosopher so some of M-P's subtle nuances are lost. Then again, so much is lost in translation anyway. Anyway you slice it, though, it is an excellent read and I recommend it full-heartedly."
1,Do NOT buy this edition,"This is a great work of philosophy that I highly recommend. However, do not by any means buy this Routledge edition. The pages of my copy began to fall out the first day I started reading it. I don't know why Routlege would release classics that are so poorly manufactured that the glue binding can't even hold up to a *single* reading. Total scam."
2,Disappointing,"I have been quite disappointed with this book. I expected some more depth in getting across what it felt like, and was really like to live in America in the 17th century. Its ver superficial. Another very annoying aspect is that when the author quotes something to back up his points its just another modern writer.I would of expected sources from the timeframe of the history, not just another author's commentary. It comes across to me like something a college student could put together.I expected to read this book and have a real sense of what it would of been like.Its just not a very good book. I had never heard of Mr. Hawke and there was no ""About the Author"" page in my copy. So when I looked him up on the internet I was quite shocked that he is a professor emeritus. While reading the book I pictured a thirty year old amature historian as the author."
4,A good overview about the American Colonies 1500-1750,"This is a good book that I found suprisingly detailed with pertinant facts that gave me a better understanding of the culture, religion, family beliefs and social way of life in early Colonial America between 1500 to 1750 (before the Revolutionary War). The author does an excellent job in emphasizing the importance of the different Christian religious sects in the colonies and how importantly they influenced the personal and social structure in colonial life. Life on the farm, in the town or villiage is studied as well as the important tools, crafts, clothing that were used. Not only is the influence of England stated in this work but that of Holland and other European powers of the time mentioned as well. This is a great book to get to understand what society and indvidual lives were like prior to the American Revolution. Overall a very interesting read!"
4,Great source for colonial life!,"One of my hobbies is recreating colonial life. I am a historical reenactor, and part of my passion for the hobby is recreating the lifestyle lived long ago as closely as possible. This book helped me immensely. I was able to understand how women especially passed their time and to pick up ways in which to create my character to her greatest potential. So many times while reading books about colonial Americans, women are virtually left out - I know they did something - but what was that something? This book helped me understand what their daily lives were all about."
2,Ok,"I bought this cd since it has a great Shudder to Think song on it since it is slightly rare and they would not sing the song when they were on tour. They are broken up now. All of the other bands are good, but don't come close to Shudder to Think."
2,Disappointed,I never recieved the item. The company said it was broken by UPS. Company did credit my account.
2,Wierd color shading,"Very comfortable shoe. But, the color would change with foot temperature. Being that your foot doesn't heat evenly, you would have these dark (very dark) patches on the shoe. Once you take the shoe off, the color would go back to its original color. Don't like them."
3,Another solo effort ...,"There's no way you can compare a Gillan album with one of his solo albums. Tormé is a unique guitar player, but without the guidance of good musicians/songwriters he doesn't impress all that much. OK, he may be punk-minded but that doesn't mean that he has to make second-rate music because he's no longer attached to a big hard rock act! His guitar still sounds good but there's much less fire in his playing. The drums are just horrible and that makes it hard for me to listen to this album. The Official Bootleg Live album suffers from the same problem. If this is what ""Tormé solo"" was meant to be, it sure isn't the stuff Gillan-fans will appreciate. But I think Bernie couldn't care less ..."
4,good interlinear,"Ignore the remarks by ""lharris"" below. His/her comments that Alfred Marshall is not a Greek scholar and that he is/was in cahoots with Zondervan to promote the NIV translation is ... nonsense. Marshall's interlinear was done in 1958, long before the NIV was in development. Read the preface/introduction.That said, this is a good choice in interlinears, as it gives you a formal equivalence (NASB) and a dynamic equivalence (NIV) translation to compare with the interlinear, to see how different translation approaches render the Greek text. Personally, I don't use an interlinear much, as I can read NT Greek, but I recommend this to those who want an interlinear."
5,So much easier to understand Scripture with this book,It's such a joy to read Scripture and be able to put the meaning behind passages much better with the different translations.
5,Great Greek Insight,"As a layman struggling to teach myself Greek, I find this Interlinear a valuable aid.To me, the ability to place two translations side by side with the original Greek and Alfred Marshall's translation is an invaluable aid to my Bible studies. By relating the Greek words to their NASB and the NIV- my favorite translations- I find I am able to gain a clearer insight into the passages I study.The other reviewers may be accurate, but to me, their criticisms are not relevant. My fluency with the Greek is too limited to fairly judge. As a student who seeks to enhance his bible reading, I find this Interlinear is a great place from which to launch my Greek journey."
2,Forgiving,"I enjoyed the time period and all the historical notes. Though a few times she referred to sending mail by Pony Express. The PE, only survived from 1860-1861. The story takes place in 1876.I would've enjoyed this much more if it was shorter. Though to me Sarah was likeable, she developed into a pathetic character after Addie left her job. Her constant nagging on Addie was annoying. Did she expect her to change in one day? And her depressed way in the end, just didn't fit. Was she depressed because of what her father did to Addie? Or upset because she didn't know how to love Noah?"
5,Forgiving,I love when I find a book that gets me so attached to the characters that I hate for the book to end.
4,Forgiving was hard to put down.,"This book started off really good. However, it seemed as though it dragged on toward the end. It was not the best book I've read by Spencer, but it was good. I like the way she made the reader feel a part of the time by being so descriptive and also by letting us know what was going on in the time and place that this story took place."
5,My Father wrote this book,"This book is slightly out-of-date, but there are many sections that can still help the prospective job seeker.Look for a revised version of this book.P.S. It was originally self published."
4,Typical MWS of the Era.,"Wow, did this guy have a ton of energy or what?! I own every MWS CD through 1995, plus ""Worship."" He settled down a bit as he got older and refined his music, but the high-energy pop sounds he (and Amy Grant) put out in the '80's drew a lot of kids to contemporary christian music that otherwise wouldn't have listened.I bought this CD for the track ""Rocketown,"" which was written for/about my hometown of Houston. (There's a version out there somewhere that has him singing ""Houston"" a couple times in the song, but I haven't found it or heard it since the '80's.) Although the other songs on this CD are good, I'm not as drawn to them as the tracks on, say, ""Change Your World"" or ""I 2 (Eye).""I would recommend this CD to fans of MWS's '80's work, but I would put at least 3 other albums - the two aforementioned plus ""Go West, Young Man"" - ahead of this one in terms of strength of effort."
5,Pinstripe surprise,Tis book was a great surprise. if you have some question about pinstripe this book is the right choice.good to paintersgood to enthusiasts
4,Excellent,"It is hard to find good sources on Runes and Rune magic. Freya requires a bit of patience, as she likes to go off about those 'life hating Christians that destroyed our heritage', and is quite opinionated at times. However, her coverage of the subject is the best I have seen. A complete, modern coverage yet with a high emphasis on traditional methods. I was quite impressed, and enjoyed her work greatly. She doesn't just give you divinitory keys, she explains where they come from culturally so you can make those connections for yourself."
1,Looks Nice---until You Turn it ON !!!,"I love SONY cellphones, but this one is a disaster mainly due to the very poor screen. Not enough light, and whatever you do see on the screen seems to be of very low resolution and low contrast.Very limited menus, although you can download some, it seems. I can't rate the other features because I got sick of it just trying to improve the themes, the wallpaper and the lighting. But, it's lowprice, so not too much money wasted."
1,Not US friendly,"This product says ""U.S. version,"" but there is nothing American about it. Mine came only with Spanish instructions and a foreign electrical cord and adapter that is not UL listed. I will not use it because I consider it unsafe. The description should make it clear that this product was not manufactured for use in the US. I am returning this unit. I bought the w200a directly from Sony Ericksson and it is exactly what I expected."
5,A First-Rate Study,"Morgan's study focuses on important concepts within the history of Christianity in Colonial New England. What were the requirements for belonging to the church? And related to this, who could be baptized and receive the Lord's Supper? Morgan supplies the answers to these questions in a readable style. Further, for the most part, he reflects on these questions in terms of what the Puritans themselves believed. In short, this is a book that anyone interested in the history of Christianity in Colonial America, especially Calvinist-oriented Christianity, will want to read."
3,"Flying, not Levitation","This is one of the best ""anorack books"" ever written, a descriptive masterpiece of what its like to fly a fighter bomber alone on a cold night. Its obsessively detailed, and its the detail that gives the account its power.Richard Bach's much vaunted 'philosophy' is almost totally absent; instead we have the musings of a lonely, thoughtful, slightly anxious young man who may have to go to war in a few weeks. For its time (around the Cuban missile crisis?) its an astonishingly mature, liberal persective on his present and the future. Indeed, one wonders how well 2nd Lt Bach, a part-time Air Guard pilot, fitted into the professional military.By the 1970s much of Bach's work had become pretentious and shallow, the flying had been replaced by levitation and seagull parables. But as his first book, ""Stranger to the Ground"" is earnest, brave and painfully honest. If you like aircraft and flying, or like reading about them, this book is a must."
5,An Old Friend,"I first read ""Stranger to the Ground"" while an Air Force pilot training student in the early 1970's. I was such an accurate presentation of the world of high performance military flying that, in later years, as an Air Force Instructor Pilot, I gave each of my students a copy as they graduated and earned their wings. It is what Tom Wolfe's ""Right Stuff"" tries to be, but, since Wolfe has never actually been there, could never achieve. I now have a young friend just embarking on his flying career and I'm purchasing a copy for him. I've just re-read my highlighted, dog-eared copy and found it as fresh and vital as the first time I read it as a 2nd Lt. A ""Must Read"" for anyone involved with airplanes."
5,Stranger to the Ground revista,"Richard Bach. What can one say about the books by Bach, except that they convey a sense of becoming and philosophy akin to poetry? If you have every reached for the long, delirious burning blue, you'll find your heart in this book."
4,Another flying story well written by Bach,"This is my second book from ""Richard Bach"". Anyhow I have lots of knowledge and love on fighter planes since a was so young so it is not so difficult to go through the book and absorb the love on flying jet fighter Richard Bach had offered. Recommended for all who are deeply in love with jet fighter stories."
3,A Conspiracy Theorist's Dream,"Okay, I will admit that this book is well researched and raises some interesting points. However, reading it is like slogging your way through the muck. I had college physics books that were easier to read. Reading this book is a commitment.I would strongly recommend that the author delete the Forward. It makes her sound too much like a whacked out conspiracy theory nut case and, IMO, might stop people from reading further. I would strongly recommend that the reader skip that part."
2,ramble ramble ramble,"I'll admit that I WOULD HAVE loved this book -- when I was 15. As an adult I am much more willing to work for the answers instead of throwing myself behind any ol good 'story'. However much Ms. Knight-Jadczk says she wants her readers to have an open mind... you can't tell from this book. Just when you think you have finally hit a good part that actually talks about something other than the author's ""future self"" conversations - she gives you one paragraph of something you can research and back to outer/inner/other space. The History of Laura's world is very interesting - to her - but not so much to me. I'll give it 2 stars because there are tidbits here and there that are interesting and useful, but there is nothing in here that is not available elsewhere. And you can find it without the pain of reading this book."
1,Psychosis,"this book, and others by the author, are a fascinating study in self-delusional psychosis. I have worked with a number of schizophrenics, and understand the world-view that is totally subjective and internal, and that cannot be challenged by such niceties are ""reality"" or facts. This proves a high-functioning psychotic can fool many gullible people, whether in politics, religion or economics! A sad world indeed when other can so easily be led astray by such insane meandering!"
1,Very disappointing .,"I bought this book without checking this person out first. What a mistake. As it turns out she is a known CULT leader and has much info out about her ideas not being founded on real facts. Her work is based on her infering that things are connected, not proving anything. Her ideas are manufactured silliness , not supported, and in many cases proved outright lies. Not history, not real, just imagined and hastily put together. Please just do your research before you make the mistake of buying this . There should be a warning somewhere !!!!"
1,lame,"Mrs. Knight-Jadzyck, advertises her book as ""a controversy that's been going on since the days of Cain and Abel"", then she throws the bible out of the window as mostly myth. Her summation of Abram & Sarah's late-in life birth of Isaac and Isaac and Rebekah's late-in life birth of Jacob & Esau as basis for the same ""myth"". As a Bible reader and her mention of Cain and Abel's origin of conspiracy and me knowing that Cain and Abel are fraternal twins of Adam and Satan from the original sin of the Garden of Eden, I was highly disappointed. For your enlihgtened discovery that there were more labyrinth's around the ancient world I say ""So?"",it doesn't seem to drop much more than a trickle in the bucket of the grand scheme of history.The most worthless 700+ pages I've ever read, can I get my wasted time back?"
5,Excellent Read!,I enjoyed this book immensely! If you want to know the TRUTH about the world that you THINK we live in this is a must read! The content is very well researched and I for one applaud all of the time and dedication it took to put this book together. Can't wait for #2! Thanks Laura!
5,This Book Is One Of The Most Important Books Ever Written,"This book is a remarkable achievement. Using the eyes of the intellect, the discipline of a scientist and historian and the heart and soul of a mystic Laura Knight-Jadczyk has brought together science and mysticism to pierce through the very nature of reality itself. Her revelations in the book regarding the hyperdimensional control system and the Techno-Spirituality of the Ancient civilizations was nothing short of mind boggling to me and I'm not same after reading it. The book had made me re-think and reevaluate everything that I had ever learned in High School and College. I liked the way the book was written. It was written for both the layman and scholar and everything in the book was backed with sound scientific research. Clearly this author has devoted her entire life to ""piercing the veil"" of reality to get to the essence of things. The book is ALIVE and is written with a intelligence that literally sparkles. I HIGHLY recommend it!!"
5,Remarkable,"Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. Ms. Knight-Jadczyk has found clues scattered throughout the world, put them all together and shows a true picture of this planet's history and what may come to be. She has bravely put the truth out there for all to see, come what may. And there are those out there who don't want the truth to be told."
5,"You've Read His-tory, Now Read Her-story","After reading some of the reviews of this book, I just had to find out for myself how good this book really was. And, I must say, that the reviews are 'right-on'. This book kept me up late at night, wanting to read more. Secret History tells us that history has been tampered with. If you are searching for the truth, this book will surely satify your craving for it, and more. Guaranteed !!JD"
1,Mind numbing boredom so far,"Hundreds of pages into the book, it's mind-numbing boredom so far. The author makes it sound like she's knows everything and most everyone else is wrong. I'm holding out hope for the last couple chapters."
5,Welcome to the real world!,"No, I'm not just quoting the Matrix in my title.Trust me, this book is one of the best books to show you the deep down truth of what is happening behind the scenes!GET THIS BOOK IF:-You ever wondered if The Matrix was real-You ever wondered why God seems so controlling in the Bible-You wonder why, even though people want peace, we keep having wars-You wonder if aliens exist, and if so, are they bad or good?-You are interested in what alchemy may really be-You have questions about anything major in the worldSeriously, this book knocked my socks off, and I'm not that much of a reader too!If you like Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, Casteneda, Mouravieff, and other esoteric authors you will LOVE Laura Knight-Jadczyk's work!If I could rate it a 8 out of 5, I would."
5,The Secret History of the World,A fantastic read!Everything you have wondered about or wanted to know is in this book.Highly recommend this one!
5,Ever Wondered Why?,"Yes you understand that Iraq is a mess. You know that Bush and Blair are liars. You understand the pain and suffering in Pallestine. You feel the whole world is going to hell in handbasket. You get sad, depressed, angry as you see the type of world being left for your children.It is time you asked why.Why is the world like it is?Read this book and you may find out."
5,a must-read for a true Seeker,"If I were cast away on an unpopulated island, and could only take one book with me, it would be this one. Truth is, I am sick of the lies and deceit of the system, and almost gave up trying to find any real answer to the two burning questions: 1) why things are the way they are, and 2) what can one do about it all? I am glad I found this book. It is packed with well researched facts, and combines scientific approach with spiritual ideas in a novel way, to paint a coherent picture of our reality. Now I can tell my children that there is hope."
4,"Clear, Consise, Informative","Author Paul Aron examines 30 different mysteries of U.S. History. Was Aaron Burr a traitor? Did James Earl Ray kill Martin Luther King? Was Alger Hiss a spy? What caused the Gulf War Syndrome? Was O.J. Simpson guilty? The author attempts to provide the answers in concise yet informative chapters that run between six and ten pages. I liked that the author seemed motivated by an honest search for the truth rather than by some desire to make political statements. For that reason alone, his conclusions seem valid. Of course, while the answers to a couple of these mysteries seem obvious, others cannot be answered with certainty. For that reason the author gives what he admits is his best guess. Also, a couple of the author's conclusions seem superfluous. But, overall this book is informative, readable and intelligent."
1,Give Me a Break,"My wife thought the book was so funny she nearly went into labor prematurely laughing so hard. I am kidding about the labor part, but she literally could not read passages aloud to me because she couldn't stop laughing. This book is nonsensical, so long as it isn't taken seriously. The authors attempt to create an alternative reality, complete with lingo, which sounds good, feels good, and has no pertinence in the reality which we all actually share. Hopefully no one will get hurt in their construct. Please don't bother."
5,A Great Book for Outlining ALL of your Choices!,"This is a super book with lots of information about the different""controversies"" in birth today. Some of the topics included are: monitoring,cesarean, episiotomy, VBAC, doulas, and much more. They offerpractical advice about how to get information you need to make aninformed decision. A must read!"
4,Great resource,"I'm pregnant with my first child, and this book did a very thorough job of explaining what to expect in the hospital, why they do the interventions they do, why these interventions might not necessarily lead to the most positive birth experience, etc. I feel more prepared now for what that might come my way during labor, thanks to this book. Anyone who claims that this book is 'unbiased', however, is sadly mistaken! The overwhelming tone of the book is 'hospitals and doctors are evil and must be destroyed'. I agree that the medical establishment intervenes too much in a natural process, but the bashing gets to be a bit much. Also, I found that much of the book's assertions are based on studies from the 1960's and 1970's...I'd like to see something a little more current. A lot can change in 30-40 years!! I still recommend the book, but I wouldn't make it the ONLY childbirth book that you pick up."
1,Does not perform as advertised.,"I found that this blade, even with a zero clearance insert cannot give a chip free edge on the back side of melamine. I'm returning it and getting a Forrest."
3,Helpful but could be better,"I am basically a newbie in this area and was hoping to learn the basics of using microarrays for sequencing and expression analysis. While it was somewhat helpful for me, I think that it is aimed at a more expert audience already well versed in molecular biology techniques. I found the documentation and other info on the Affymetrix site to be more comprehensive and explanatory."
4,Great doll,"Please people do not believe these reviews. The photo does not do the doll justice at all. She is lovely and I have bo regrets on purchasing her. I have only one tiny complaint. Her hair got messed up and came undone but it is okay cause now her hair is long and prettier than before. Her clothes are real nice. She comes with a suitcase, trading card, two toyko stickers, a dog, a dog bag, and a suitcase and ipod thing for the doll. Do not miss out on this great doll i promise you wont have any regrets! -Raye1994-"
5,What a delight with terrific heart,"I didn't know much about this film when I went to see it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival (which I almost didn't get into because it was SOLD OUT). Thankfully I got in because it was one of the sweetest, most heartfelt films I had seen in a while. A few years back I saw '29th and Gay' (made by the same team) and loved that too. What I love about Daisy Pictures is that their films are a refreshing take on gay life. Well acted, well crafted, and fun. And who doesn't love Carrie Preston on True Blood?!"
1,VERY different from the short-film !,"I saw an amazing short film with the same title and same basic plot at the NC gay and lesbian movie festival 2009. I don't know the story behind this but despite the striking similarities, the directors are distinct and this ""feature"" movie despite being longer is very shallow compared with the short one. I felt cheated because I thought this was an augmented version of the short but it is a very diluted one. I stopped watching it after 20 or 30 minutes."
1,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed on this film. First, the story is too much about the mum = 70 %, and she talked non-stop, after 20 min I stopped the dvd and throwed it away! I dont recommend this dvd to anyone."
4,A dissapointing start,I was so ecited when I got this becuse Im ubsesed with yu yu hakusho but I was dissipointined. This had vary little action. The only reson I gave this 4 stars was becuse of the comedy.
4,A dramatically diffirent Diana book.,"The book explores how Diana affected and still effects our psychic lives. The response to her death nor the public's interest during her life, can be explained only by her beauty or royalty or even her humanitarian pursuits.Diana touches deep cords within us. When reading this book, you could well remember one of your own Diana dreams that you had forgotten. I hope more is written on this subject in the future."
3,"Great bag...holds everything, but....","Great bag...holds everything, but does not drain water at ALL. I'm using it on boat dives and it's a lot more rigid than a mesh bag, but it just doesn't drain or dry out very well."
5,Jason Shinder did the research so you don't have to.,"First Book Market gives me key information on where and how I can get my book published. It includes, among other things, deadlines, addresses, hints, guidance, and awards. Creating a first book takes time. First Book Market frees me to put my energy into my book. With First Book Market, I don't have to reinvent the wheel. Jason Shinder has pulled together hundreds of otherwise disparate sources offering generous tips from those who have gone before us. It's like applying to college; without a guide to help, we face a daunting task. This book makes the daunting fun."
1,Title should be: Writing Contests for Unpublished Writers,"The only information for where to publish your first book is on 31 pages out of 308, but the information is only the very basic, IE: publishers' addresses and phone numbers. The rest is for writing contests and stories on writers who have won writing contests. I would suggest going elsewhere to find the type of information that this book implies it has. The phrase, ""Don't judge a book by its cover,"" certainly applies to this one."
2,Disappointing book with a misleading title.,"I bought this book on-line because its title promised an information-packed guide for aspiring writers. What a terrible disappointment and waste of money. There are no procedural guidelines about submitting manuscripts and approaching publishers. Rather, this book is just a collection of random, almost irrelevant musings (considering the title's promise of a fact-filled, how-to type manual) and a listing of essay contests."
5,I like the title,"I like the title. I think all three editors did a good job. I'm not trying to get a book published, but I found this book fascinating because it explores the mysteries of the sometimes zen-, othertimes shark-like world of publishing. After reading this book, I'm left feeling that these writers either need the enormity of clammy perserverance or quicksilver luck. You can't just have talent as a writer -- you need publishing talent, too!"
1,Reads like a Harlequin Romance,"The writing style is completely different than the other books. At times it reads like what I would imagine a Harlequin Romance would be like. The book is just dreadful and completely inappropriate for the target market, i.e., girls from 6 - 12. As other reviewers have stated (thorvald's and RoseFan's take below are spot on), Rose is no longer the self confident heroine but a confused follower. She falls in with the wrong crowd. I guess a parent who is reading along with their daughter could use this as a learning lesson, but the subject is too adult for the bedtime story age child. I suggest you avoid this book."
4,too rushed,"Thoroughly charming, but rushed at the end. Having read a previous volume written by Mr. McBride, I realize, however, Rose's life quickly becomes more adult, and thus, less appealing for children. She is just as fascinating as her mother."
3,Poor ending for outstanding series,"My daughter is a true lover of little house series and she reads it over and over again. But for this book, she just read it once and never touch it again. The other Rose's stories are rich in details, full of description, and going slow time wise, giving a complete picture about Rose's life. ""Bachelor Girl"" seems to be in rush to just end the series, it's not as beautifully written as the others. Rose's thinking and minds are not completely told."
1,Not a very good ending to the series,"I've read most of the rose years. The books before this one are interesting. In this last book, I was very displeased. Rose leaves home and boards in a small isolated room which leaves her with no friends. Although she makes friends towards the end, she ends up doing things she shouldn't and loses her engagment with her childhood sweetheart because of her new friends. This book was a disappointment to me after enjoying the books before this. :("
3,Disappointing,"I was a HUGE fan of the Laura Ingalls Wilder series so I started to read Rose's series too. I fell in love with them as I did for the other series. It came down to this book. I bought it as soon as I could and started reading it the second I got it. It was amazing, like the others... until the middle-end. My heart stopped beating when she talked to Paul. I don't want to say too much to give any part of it away, but I cried toward the end when Rose and Paul talked. I was upset for days after I read it. Maybe I just had high hopes. Some people may be fine with the way it ended, but I was not. I haven't picked up the book since then - that was 2 years ago. Don't get me wrong, it was written beautifully, carrying on with the series perfectly. I just didn't like the ending."
4,Good alternative...,"I purchased several of the Capella Flavor Drops for adding to coffee. I wouldn't say they are quite as yummy as a nice flavored coffee blend, but they are a good alternative for adding to a non-flavored cup of coffee. It really only takes a couple of drops, so they are good value too."
3,"Worth it, but scenes change too frequently","The producer(s) of this video managed to keep the narrator where s(he) belongs: BEHIND the camera. For a vivid example of the horrors caused by failing to do so, see another work in this genre--""There Goes A Bulldozer."" (TGAB) However, the scenes in Big Machines, as in TGAB, are too short and the changes in camera angles too numerous. A few scoops of dirt, combined with closeups, distance shots, and much camera panning, all in less than a minute, and we're off to another machine. Children enjoy repetition. They don't mind watching the same backhoe fill its bucket 20 or 30 times in a row."
4,Similar To Christie Front Drive,"If you were looking for a band who sounds like Christie Front Drive, this is it. Better recording quality, a litlte more clear on the delivery of the lyrics. Restless time is the stand out track in my mind, the slow build and suprisingly perfect synthesizers really take them beyond just being a CFD clone."
4,Great scale for tubbies,"This is great scale, can get KG, LB or stone measurements. Very happy with the product, however the shipper of choice, UPS, was abysmal. After paying them over $100 in shipping (bear in mind the scale was only about $70) they delayed, and lied and ignored my requests for information as the product was processed by the incompetants at the Chinese customs department. Thoroughly disgusted with the service and personell at UPS and will do anything I can to avoid using them from now on."
2,Difficult for those in the high weight group,"I bought this scale because it could weigh people over 350 lbs., which at the time of purchase, I was. However, I found it very difficult to use. Bending over to tap the scale hurt my knees. Keeping my feet so close together, as required by the directions, made me rotationally unstable. I had to hold on to a towel rack to not keel over. When you are in the over 350 lb category, you need a wide stance. I gave the scale away and bought a typical doctor's mechanical scale."
3,up to 440lb. but not less than 10...,"Seems to be a nice scale, it appears to weigh me within .2 pounds each time, but we purchased this to use at work also to weigh packages. Anything under 10 lbs doesnt seem to register. I thought accurate to .2 lbs meant it would work at .2 or heck i'd be happy with 3.2, obviously that's why I dont manufacture scales! Guess i need a cheapo scale to weigh little stuff? for $80 you can't get that kind of accuracy..."
5,There back the greatest band in the world the Backstreet Boys,"Wow!!!!!!!!!!!! I am there biggest fan ever , let me review the song Just want you to know.(a) An hilairious music video my favourite part was when Kevin was kissing.(b) A great song and a great rock track.FROM A HUGE BSB FAN FROM ADAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,OK but not the BEST,"I liked this song the least off NG, but I found the video cute and funny. Nick and Aj are rock fans so i'm sure it was fun for them to do this video. In fact all THE BOYS seemed to have fun with this one."
1,Disappointing,"I too was disappointed. Who cares about the history of the dumbbell. I want muscle. He simply went through his work out and it was the low volume, max to failure stuff. I just thought it was going to be more in depth and better. Don't waste your money on this video. I still don't know what the Paleo diet is???"
5,A nourishing feast of information!,"Look at My Ugly Face dives deep into the wreckage of our obsession with appearance and comes up with pearls of magic and wisdom. Reading it, I was struck by the degree to which my attitudes towards beauty and ugliness were determined by culture and by my dreams and fantasies. Halprin has provided some useful tools for recognizing when we are stuck in one role or the other--and for living each role whole-heartedly. I found the fairy tales and personal stories she used to illustrate theroles deeply compelling.A nourishing feast of information!"
1,This book is unreadable,"Halprin rambles on and on and on making little sense, only rarely discussing her topic. The entire thing is one long whine. Nothing is said as what actually constitutes beauty except from a feminist viewpoint, which is unintelligible."
2,Easy Reading,"Although the style of the writer is simple and easy to understand, I think the book is vague in regards of beauty and ugliness. At the end I didnt really know what to make of one or the other. We know the obvious advantages of beauty, but I still did not get how ugliness is suppose to improve anybody's life.Yes,there were a lot of definitons, but I still dont know what to what to make of them."
1,Avoid this one at all costs....,"A large turd left in the road by a mangy mongrel. Watch your step, folks......"
5,In the Company of Stone: Wonderful Coffee Table Book,"Being a native resident of Vermont this book is very precious to me. I lived on a dairy farm with dry stone walls that were very plain. Dan Snow made the process into an art form as well as for practical use. The back of the book gives locations of some of his work here in VT and NH and I look forward to seeing some of it next summer. This book is one that should sit on a coffee table to be picked up and scanned by your guests rather than sitting on a bookcase shelf. The book is not only about the work of Dan Snow but a showcase of the photos by Peter Mauss, in color as well as black & white. It is a book you will treasure."
4,Fresh!,"Rick gives the listener a fresh look at love in its many forms...marriage, spiritual, first love, being loved, and giving love. His style appeals to all listeners, religious or not. This album is a must for adults and adolescents facing the TRUE definition of love in a chaotic world full of mixed messages. Buy it and enjoy!"
4,Good Stuff,"This is a very nice effort by Rick Cua. He has been around Christian Music it seems like forever, and as time has gone by, his music has ""mellowed"" a bit, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't still offer great recordings. This album offers many heart-felt songs that you will really enjoy- no matter if you are a Christian listener or just a lover of good music. Tracks 6,7, and 10 are my favorites, but that shouldn't take anything away from the other tunes."
4,"Great pants, just wished they offered them in different lenghts","I bought these pants and they look great, the only thing you have to be careful is the zipper, it is a little flimsy (or at least in mine were) you have to be careful when pulling it up. I have about 4 pairs of these pants and the first time I tried one of them and was not careful about the zipper, it broke.I wish they offered them in different lengths (short/regular/long). Even though you can tie them on the legs, in my case they're a bit long and even after tying them they bunch up at the bottom. This again is not a defect of course...just an observation if you wear 30-32 length pants these might be a bit long"
4,Great pants for the Most part,"I have To say, these pants are very nice, quality is good for the price as well. Only thing is..I bought a medium, and unlike most BDU pants sized medium, these run a bit on the smaller side...Thats my only reason for the 4 stars.I wear between a 33-34 Waist, if you're the same, I would suggest a size bigger..but these are great pants."
4,Great BDU pants,"Despite their name ""Military Black Ultra Force BDU Pants' the pants you pull out of the box are pretty laid back and subdued in appearance.65-35 poly-cotton blend. Button fly, buttons on most pockets. Quite comfortable to wear all day.Waist cinch tabs are a huge plus.Great pant for the money and roomy everywhere you need it. Would buy again."
3,MADE IN CHINA,"well the textile looks good , finishing quality isn't there are various strands here and there and one more thing if waist is in the range of 46 - 50 inches don't order the XXX size because it will be bigger than your real size by at least 8 more inchs"
2,Nothing Revolutionary,"This is not so much the debunking of myths, but the debunking of the current dumbed-down version of history as taught by our contemporary school system. A serious student of history will not learn much, but perhaps it may serve to open some oportunities for the reader to do further study and to pursue a more in depth knowledge of history."
2,What happned to good book making?,"This review is a bit off topic as it is not so much the content of the book I take issue with, but the physical book itself.The book is so poorly made that it is virtually impossible to pleasurably read it. Amazon's price of the book takes the price out of the stratosphere, but still at over $25.00 retail the book should at least be bound properly and made of decent paper. This book, perhaps geared toward the paperback reader is very difficult to open, page thru and read. Frankly out of frustration trying to get the pages to open properly I just chucked it into the garbage."
5,Founding Myths: Stories That Hide Our Patriotic Past,"I was aware of some but not all the lies that have been foisted upon students, especially the young. This should be required reading, particularly those who teach History."
5,GLorie2God,1st heard years ago in Delaware. I loved the concert at Living Water Church. Great guy and great sound! I sure have missed this album. Excited to have found it again. Closer To the Fire was my favorite song in 1994. Thanks Michael and Amazon.Gary Lane
2,Doesn't Stick to Cardboard Boxes,"The tape is fairly tough, but I can't get it to stick to cardboard boxes. It does seem to stick OK to something really smooth, like a paper envelope, but not to anything with a little bit of texture, like brown cardboard (you know---all those empty Amazon boxes I have out in the garage--- ). One of the previous reviews has a response from a 3M representative, saying ""Please give our customer service department a call ... and we will work to resolve this quickly."" That's OK, but I think I'd like to see something a bit more proactive; something that makes me think the next tape that I order won't have the same problem."
1,HORRIBLE DOESN'T STICK,Can you imagine sticky tape that doesn't stick?? Not one roll was usable. A complete waste of money. I hated it.
3,Normally great stuff - Amazon is shipping defective merchandise,"I've been using Scotch packaging tape for years - couldnt live without it. But, like all the other reviewers, there is something wrong with the product Amazon is selling. Defective? Old? Stored incorrectly? Who knows...So - 5 stars for a product that is normally great + 0 stars for defective product = 3 stars for this review."
5,Best packaging tape on the market,I have used this packaging tape for years without problem. I have found it to be the best tape for general packaging and you can rely on it to get your package delivered in one piece. It is very strong and durable and it clear so it looks nice. It works very well in a tape dispenser.
1,Doesn't stick to anything,"Bought a 6-pack of this tape couple months ago on Amazon. What can I tell you - on grand scheme of things it was a waste. It simply doesn't stick to anything. Not to carton, not even to plastic. What kind of packaging tape is that? I can't even seal a plastic bag with it, never mind a cardboard box."
4,Nice strong packing tape,"I go through a LOT of packing tape so I thought I would give the Scotch Super Strength Packing Tape a try. Ok...well, what is there to say about tape. It sticks well. It cuts good out of the dispenser (you have to have your own dispenser as these are refill rolls). It's a little hard to get a fresh roll started, they do have a spot where you are supposed to be able to get a new roll started, but it is difficult to grab hold of that to get it started (these are not e-z start rolls). My only other complaint with this tape is that I think because it is so much thicker of a tape, it sometimes has a tendency to want to wrinkle if you don't keep it going in a perfectly straight line while laying it down. Other than that, it does what it should and I have not had any complaints yet about the tape being unstuck from a package."
4,"Excellent product, but pricy.","While this product is excellent in every way, there are less expensive product that will be sufficient. If money is no object and the highest quality is what you need or want, then this your product. Otherwise, you may want to shop around. At the current pricing of $29 for 6 rolls, I think you can do better, and I am not sure it's worth it."
5,Perfect mailing & packing tape,"I've been using this tape for years now and won't buy anything else. It's very strong yet easy to cut, and fits on the handheld roll cutters perfectly. I use it for everything including sealing boxes and reinforcing envelope seals or Priority Mail envelopes."
3,Called Scotchbrand Customer Service for help,"This tape doesn't stick to anything - not even to itself! Having used 3M tape for years with no problems, I called Scotchbrand Customer Service. A pleasant rep named Heather informed me that the adhesive has a shelf life of approximately 2 years and that if the tape is stored in a cold location, it loses its stickiness. I don't know whether the tape I received a year ago was old stock or whether Amazon's warehouse was cold, but apparently there was a problem before I received my order. It has continued to deteriorate throughout the year. Heather is sending a replacement. It is difficult to know how many stars to give this product because, on the one hand, 3M stood behind it, but on the other hand, the tape I received was either old or stored in a cold location."
1,Doesn't stick!!!!,"This stuff doesn't stick at all. I had one or 2 rolls of the bunch that were OK, but not great. And the rest were just garbage - no stickiness at all."
5,Best Tape for Shipping,"Love this tape for shipping packages, which we do a lot of. Originally I orderedScotch Long Lasting Moving & Storage Packaging Tape, 1.88 Inches x 54.6 Yards, 4 Rolls (3650-4)and was horribly disappointed, how can Scotch tape not stick to cardboard boxes I thought? I actually bought my first roll of this stuff from the FedEx Office store after taping up a box with the Moving tape and having it fly open a minute later. Maybe I had a bad roll but I was very unimpressed. Enter this tape, the Heavy Duty Shipping tape. Works wonderfully! I used my Amazon iPhone app to scan a 4-pack roll of these in a store and ordered the same items from Amazon, but they come in 3 larger rolls instead, so you're getting the same amount of tape as the older 4 pack. Great stuff, will buy again on the next restock."
2,Still not fixed,"I ordered this bundle of tape thinking that after months of bad reviews the stickiness problem had surely been sorted out. it hasn't been.The quality of the tape is great. It's thick and seems pretty strong. The problem is the adhesive is terrible. It sticks on well the day you put it on, but when you come back two or three days later its pulled up and off. I just spent the morning re-taping boxes.If you need tape for some local storage you'll probably be ok, but odds are you're like me, buying this bulk for a big relocation. I'm certain a little humidity and a whole lot of cross country jostling will result in all my boxes being wide open when they arrive. I've re-taped as much as I can. fingers crossed.update - The boxes came through. the tape was loose on most boxes but nothing erupted or was lost. I'm glad they made the trip but i'd still look for something else if I had it to do over."
4,Tape sticks fine,"Other reviews have commented a lot that this tape is not sticky. I ordered it March 2012 and the tape sticks just fine. It's thicker than your ordinary packing tape, but is just as clear. It's practically invisible when attaching labels to boxes. I wish there was a good non-petroleum product available that works as well as this, which is why it only gets 4 stars instead of 5"
1,Doesn't stick at all,Saturday I packed up some items I would be shipping out on Monday. I printed out some UPS labels and taped them to the side of the box using this tape. Everything looked fine at first. Then I wake up on Sunday to see that the label has fallen off. Imagine if I had sent it on Saturday - the package would be lost in transit by now. I should've known better than to buy a product that was stocked by Walmart. Demanding a refund.
1,Doesn't stick for me,"I don't know what is happening, but I just tried out some tape I bought around December 2010 and it simply doesn't stick - about as strong as a post-it note. They must be having a major issue with QC on this product. I am not doing anything fancy - taping closed cardboard boxes."
5,Good Quality Tape,"You really do get what you pay for. I've used cheaper packaging tape and I've used Scotch. Scotch is by far the best. It pulls off the roll easily, cuts cleanly, and sticks firmly to the package. You don't need more than one row of tape for most packing. What more can you ask for?Highly recommended."
5,What 20x stronger means,"20x stronger doesn't mean how much force it takes to make the plastic of the tape rip apart. Instead this is about the adhesive holding power.. how strong does the adhesive hold the tape onto the box when it is pulled in a shear direction (not straight up, but sideways). That's how the box might loosen up if the tape had poor shear strength. I've been using this tape for a couple years now and I've been happy with it's secure bond. When it comes to tape it never hurts to over-engineer a little bit so you can use less tape and so the box contents won't spill out when shipping reall heavy items."
4,It's packaging tape,"I used over a dozen rolls for my recent move for taping boxes, and the packaging tape did what it was supposed to securely. I did not experience a lack of ""stickiness"" that many other reviewers are complaining about. Perhaps there was a large, bad batch? I will not hesitate to buy more for my next move or for shipping out packages."
1,"Heavy Duty, yes. Sticky? Not at all.","Presumably I got a bad batch, but this tape doesn't stick. At all. I really have to press it to the cardboard just to make it stay. It falls off right away. I tend to think that one star reviews should be reserved for products that set your house ablaze or come to life and rape your pets, but this is pretty binary: Does this product fulfill its sole function in the world? It does not. One star."
1,Kindle formatting wrong again,"Formatting warning for Kindle readers. The formatting of the footnotes is terrible. They pop up in the middle of paragraphs sometimes even pages away from the reference, vary extremely in font size (sometimes same size as the rest of the text, sometimes super small font) and worst of all are incomplete with cut offs mid sentence. For the price being charged for the Kindle version at the moment that's unacceptable.For the actual book: 5 stars. Beautifully written and very direct story of a Japanese man being tugged between the choice for modern western life and the traditional lifestyle and the women connected to those lifestyles and choices. Quiet unhappiness in marriage without actual fights or even dislike and the main character's inactive, passive way of dealing with this seem to be reoccurring themes for Tanizaki."
3,A melancholic separation,"This is a novel about the old and the young generation in the 1920s in Japan.A couple of the new one wants to separate because their sexual passion has disappeared. The father of the woman tries to convince the couple to continue to stay together.""The reason for their decision to separate was that they did not want to grow old, that they wanted to be free to live their youth again."" (p.31)The novel is autobiographic and symbolic, which is well explained by the well-known and outstanding translator E. Seidensticker.But the story should more appeal to the Japanese than to foreign readers, because it refers regularly to authentic Japanese themes as the old and new Japanese puppet theatre or the motif of the woman as a doll.It is shrouded in a sad and melancholic atmosphere.Only for the Tanizaki aficionados."
3,Decente,"Aconsejo no prestar demasiada atención a las críticas que se quejan del vocabulario castizo en contraposición al vocabulario americano. No hay prácticamente nada que un lector castellanohablante educado no pueda entender, y el castellano utilizado en el libro es adecuado para la trama.La traducción en sí, exceptuando algún resbalón con el subjuntivo, es gramaticalmente correcta. No conozco el original en inglés.El argumento abunda en lo descriptivo, con un ritmo de la acción lento durante casi toda la obra, concentrando la mayor parte del desenlace en los últimos 3 o 4 capítulos. La sensación de desasosiego que algunas críticas mencionan en este sentido es legítima.En general, la obra es medianamente entretenida y contribuye a adquirir vocabulario."
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Excellent reading for everyone. The plot was well deveoped and the narrative descriptive and colorful. The characters are so well defined you feel as though you know them and they become friends or enemies. Just when you think you know where the plot is headed it diverts and takes a completely different direction. The book keeps you guessing, thinking and feeling. Its a ""must have"" for every young person's collection."
3,Caleb Garvin,"Fue un cumpleaños horrible para Harry Potter y para hacer cosas más mal un elfo aparece en la habitación de los Dursleys. El elfo da una advertencia de una amenaza mortal en Hogwarts (una escuela por magos y magas), y Harry no puedes ir a la escuela.Harry no escuchando escapo de la casa de los Dursleys con la ayuda su amigo más mejor Ron. Cuando Harry y Ron llegaste al Hogwarts la cámara secreta fue abierta. Con más y más personaEso es uno de los libros que yo no puedes parar de leer. Con un cuento muy imaginativo e interesante. Yo recomendar a cada alguien quien lo amas un bueno cuento que entretener la leedor todo la cuentto. Yo piensa que es J.K Rowlings libro más mejor."
3,One of the better Nazareth albums of the 1980's,"Cinema is a solid effort. To some extent it marks a return to form for the band as it contains a number of straight-ahead rockers with a few slower numbers mixed in for good measure. The production on the remastered version is very good, although the two extra tracks are disappointing in that they are very similar to the main versions already included on the CD. Highlights include the raucous ""Salty Salty"" and haunting ""A Veteran's Song""."
1,argh,$3.97 at Homeless DepotNot that thickMade in USA but they were not proud enough to stamp the thickness of this clear tape.ludicrous
1,pure crap,"trying to move, and I bought this crap tape. Unbelievable, it continually breaks and I spend minutes starting over. It has taken me 20 minutes to tape one box. May god punish them."
2,Very thin packing tape,"Even for most cheap rolls of packing tape from the local department store, the quality and thickness is much better. I'm not sure how durable this tape is, but it's very, very thin and is so thin it bunches up with almost every cut/tear in the tape."
4,"decent quality, economy grade, clear packing tape...","This is an economy grade clear packing tape of medium thickness. It is not so thin that it easily splits and tears when you are unrolling it, and it is not as thick as some of the heavier duty, more expensive tapes. It is quite suitable for general uses, like packing, strapping, and mailing, where the tape will not be subjected to excessive stress. The amount of adhesive is adequate, but perhaps slightly on the light side.Tartan is a division of 3M, a corporation who have been around for ages, manufacturing all kinds of plastic products. This tape is supposedly made in the USA, and is 1.88 inches (48mm) wide, and 54.6 yards (50 meters) in length. There are many similar products available that can do the same job, so the main selling point probably comes down to price. At $2.00 or less, you are probably getting a fair deal. Check your local store for a more competitive price."
5,good value,"Good value for cheap, but perfectly good packing tape. I was looking for bargain tape refills to go with my new tape gun, and this did the trick."
2,Screen scratched by poor design - be careful!,"I would understand if I had this problem with a generic case I bought somewhere. But for Canon to make this case for their own cameras, and have a design flaw that causes such a big problem is really poor. I love my camera but this case is the result of ignorant design. Very disappointing product design from Canon. I take very good care of my things and to have my LCD scratched in the first 3 weeks I owned it - bc of this case - is really frustrating."
5,love this case!,This case is great! So glad I bought it. It's sleek and compact. You can put it in your purse without taking up too much room.
3,Canon Digital Elph Accessory Kit 3,Great value.. but the case just fits the camera. no space for the extra battery.
1,The case will scracth your screen!,"This case has one major flaw: If you wear it on you belt, it is nearly impossible to put the camera back in without it touching the inside of the open case flap. This gentle touch will eventually put horrible scracthes on the matted camera screen, unless you remember to flip the camera in which case the scracthes appear on the camera body. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE. Get a soft one instead."
1,The case is crap,I thought I was getting a good deal with buying all these items together. I was expecting the case that I got for my SD110 which was quite nice. The case is cheap cheap cheap - Made in China crap. The leather is one step above plastic. The snap to close it scratches the camera. It is basically terrible. The neck strap is a cheapie throw in as well. Just get the battery individually and get another case. This is not worth it. I am so disappointed. It spoilt the enjoyment of getting my new SD300.
3,Not impressed,I was not impressed by the case at all. There is no padding and the fit is so tight it's hard to get the camera out of the case. Not ideal if the case is on your belt. The neck strap is OK but pretty thin and not very comfortable. I bought a LowePro Ridge 10 case at at Amazon that is much better. Has padding and a pouch for an extra battery and it was $8.99.
1,disappointing,This would be a good coffee table book. Most of the orchids highlighted are fairly common to orchid growers. This would be a good book for someone who is not familier with orchids. It is over priced for the information that it contains. I would suggest waiting until it shows up on a discount table. I would not invest any money for this book.
5,very good,i trust Natrol products and order this brand alot. i read alot of health articles and i use anything that will keep me healthy!
1,The Robe - Wes King,"As far as christian music goes I was very dissatisfied with this CD. I actually bought it for song #1 only and was hoping that they rest of the CD was going to be good. Well, at least some of the songs. I was very dissappointed. Not very much ""glorifing God"". The songs were more like a secular song that could swing the christian way if you choose to apply the vocals that way (or visa versa)."
5,Good mystery,I really liked this book because I didn't know what was going to happen until the end. I really thought that Arthur was in trouble. It's a good mystery and you have to read it to find out what it's about. I'm not going to tell you.
3,Typical Sanchez.,The track selection is good on this release. The problem is that the track selection is old. I've been hearing these same tracks in the clubs for about a year. Why then would I want to continue hearing them on this CD? The reason for purchasing a disc from a world renouned DJ is to hear fresh and unreleased tracks?
5,Absolute Greatest,"This is an often played masterpiece at my house. It is simply wonderful. If you enjoy Celtic music, you'll love The Color Green. If you enjoy folk and pop, you'll love Here in America. Bottom line, you really will probably love all the songs on this album. Enjoy!"
5,Could this be the best Christian music album?,"If you're a Rich Mullins fan and you don't own this album, all I can say is, why? In my opinion, the best thing about this man's music are the lyrics. There aren't Christian cliches in this album--it is like poetry set to music. It illustrates the magnificent beauty of God's creation, but without worshiping nature or leave you scratching your head over the meaning. And if the lyrics weren't enough, the music is. 'Peace' had beautiful piano music, and 'Creed' even has hammer dulcimer. Talk about an interesting albulm! Between the beautifu music and lyrics, this albulm is probably my favorite of all time. It might become yours..... I agree with the other reviewer, five stars just isn't enough!"
4,Filter is okay.,The air filter is okay and I can recommend it to my friend and anyone. Item delivered was as it was advertised.
5,Kids Cooking,""" A practical 'how to' book, to give young cooks a sound background in the kitchen. All the dishes are popular, well-established favorites. All have been thoroughly tested. Most important, all have been a great success with the boys and girls who attend the author's cooking classes. ... There are sections for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, party and regional dishes, as well as a separate chapter on safety rules. The emphasis of the book is on the pleasure of cooking, and the pleasure of sharing and entertaining."" - quoted from inside the dust jacket"
1,Very disappointing for a beginner,"I'm a Crystal Reports beginner. This book is not useful at all. You can easily create a simple report by following the steps described in first two chapters. However, after that, I was totally lost. The book describes a lot of things available in Crystal Reports without following samples. There are samples available for each chapter on the web. However, there was no connection between the samples and the book. I don't how the sample reports were produced and I just couldn't learn how to create reports by just reading the book. I'm very disappointed at the book."
4,Good Action RPG,"Shining Force Exa, is a good game. It's a fun hack and slash rpg with fast fast slashing game play or fast magic casting gameplay. The story isn't amazing, but it's fun to play through and see what'll happen next. The voice acting is pretty good, and I could easily sit down for long periods of time and play through this game. I'd say there is about 30hours of game play if you just concentrate on the main quest, and don't worry about other side objectives or exploring the maps. If you do explore the maps and master your abilities and level up your geo-fortress all the way as you play then you'll have a lot more content to do, and it'll be worth your while.Overall not the best game ever, but a fun 30 hour+ adventure that will be enjoyable for you to play through."
3,A stale entry into the Kate Milholland series,"While Rough Trade is not awful (hence the three star review), the author has produced better books in the Kate Milholland series. Even though the slow-as-molasses subplot of who Kate loves FINALLY picks up a little steam, the main plot of the book is convoluted. It does not help that the author does not give us enough insight or background into the book's supporting characters. Perhaps she thinks because she kills most of them off that the reader will not care. While these are annoying flaws in the book, the series overall is enjoyable. As for this book, the author keeps up the speedy pace of a mystery thriller and obviously has done her homework about football team ownership and the corporate politics it involves. ""Bitter Business"" is a better read in the series, but ""Rough Trade"" will do for now."
5,Typical Bosch Quality,"Beautiful design and engineering... unlike most stuff made in Taiwan, there are no sharp or rough edges... everytning is the highest quality, even the bolts and nuts. Good directions, actually written in good English. Expensive but the quality makes it worthwhile... an heirloom that can be passed down through the generations."
5,"You Want This -- You REALLY, REALLY Want This!","This is an outstanding product, but it's rather expensive here. You'll probably want to buy it from Amazon.com; that's where all the good, detailed reviews are, too.The product in a nutshell: a heavy, substantial base for most (not just Bosch) benchtop saws, that makes the combination of heavy saw and heavy base remarkably easy to move around. Superb balance (no hydraulics involved) give it this ease when changing between the operating and upright-for-moving positions, and pneumatic tires let you negotiate uneven ground with aplomb.Highly recommended."
5,Great Stand,"This stand is great. Easy to use and works great with my Bosch table saw. Also, folds down for easy storage."
5,Saw stand,All I can say is that I wish I had bought the saw stand years ago. This saw stand works very smoothly and with out fuss.
5,Great portable saw stand !!!!!,"I do residential remodeling, have for over 20 years, and have used this saw stand for about 4 mo. now and I can tell you that this is the best addition to the saw you could make. It makes a difference if you work out of a cargo trailer though. It wouldn't work too good from the back of a pick up as it is very heavy with the saw attached.Although I gave it 5 stars there is one thing that Bosch could improve on and that is some sort of rear support to keep the saw from tilting back when you push 4x8 sheets of plywood through.You definitely need help doing that."
1,somewhat pleased,Let me start of with my tablesaw model 315.228390 craftsman the tablesaw is heavy.That is why i bought the TS 2000stand. In the complete folded position the stand tips over.The bar should be longer to prevent this .So there goes the space safeing feature.furthermore i am a short person . there is no hight adjustment.basicly what i am saying the folding feature is useless for me . a solid stand would work just fine.bosch does not inform consumers that there are limitations with this stand .seriously thinking of returning it.HGW
5,As good as it gets,I bought it to go w/my Bosch table saw; design and material couldn't be better. Hope it could be a bit cheaper.......
5,nice!,"had to drill a couple of additional holes to accomodate my Craftsman saw, but aside from that, takes the dread out of setting up and moving`the tablesaw and necessary stand, whatever it may be. this stand rolls nicely and appears to be really durable, mine rides in the back of the pickup along with everything else piled on top.... at least for me, this thing is worth every cent..."
4,I like it but...,"If you are purchasing this to add to a stack of these you already have, make sure you check the frequency range your devices operate in. I didn't, and the range this product works in is not the same as the identically modeled products we already had at our church. Which means that I can't easily swap mics/packs around, as I had originally planned to be able to do. Oh well, live and learn. A few other items of note: the mic i received was the ATW-T220a, which has the charging pads on the side (meaning it can charge using http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATW-CHG2-Two-Bay-Recharging-Station/dp/B004MFEYDI."
4,Man in control.,A very good read.Just enough intrigue to keep you guessing. Wonderful ending. The writer is very blessed with good writing skills
4,like,I enjoyed reading this book very much. I would recommend this book to others to read. Love to read books by this author.
2,Can't stand the hero & heroine!,"Got 2 stars only because Diana Palmer writes well. BUT I could not stomach her hero & heroine. What an unhealthy codependent relationship they've got going! Heroine is so codependent, obsequious, & a doormat that even when she overhears the hero blast her about how he really thinks of her she still concedes to his wishes. Ugh! The romance is just not believable. Just hard to see how hero becomes attracted to her when he still sees heroine as extremely insecure, weak, & directionless.DO NOT waste your time reading this book."
4,palmerfan,"This is a typical Palmer read, which means the male protagonist is a chauvinist/misogynist, and the heroine is a lovestruck virgin with no backbone who, it seems, is required to suffer a lot of verbal and emotional abuse and humiliation from him before he is able to realize/admit he loves her, and she then anxiously capitulates. The description of this book was misleading as it gave me the impression that after Jodie overheard Alex's excruciating insults, she finally had enough guts to say ""who needs this?"" and cuts her ties with Alex and Margie until, after 8 years, she agrees to help Alex bust drug dealers. Ms. Palmer's stories are interesting and the romance is hot (even though she only ""alludes"" to the sex), but I hate that her females are usually victims because they are sexually inexperienced."
3,Storyline from Publisher . . .,"Ever since DEA agent Alexander Cobb had given Jodie Clayburn a Texas-size brush-off, they'd been sworn enemies. But eight years later, an undercover operation brought them back together again. This cynical Long, Tall Texan couldn't believe the baby-faced schoolgirl was now an understated beauty who electrified his senses and his heart. Or that she'd help him crack the drug-smuggling case that threatened all of Jacobsville. Tantalized to the core, Alexander would risk everything to possess -- and protect -- the untouched young woman. This fearless secret agent always got his man -- or in this case, woman. But this time would the man in control get caught in his own web of danger . . . and desire?"
1,Author Out of Control,"This book was so bad I couldn't even give it a star but it wouldn't post without one. But it's more than this book deserves.Why is it that Ms Palmer continues to write heros who are harsh, hateful and cruel. Makes you wonder what her relationships with men are. I would have told Alexander Cobb where to go and it wouldn't be pleasant. I will never buy another of her books. It's always the same weak women and cruel men. No woman needs to read that."
4,Sweet Love story,"Alexander Cobb didn't really know what or who he wanted , but he knows Jodie Clayburn was at the top of his list for a wife if he wanted one. (a little big headed.)Alexander and his sister Margie treat Jodie like a poor relation. and she takes it.Until she over hears Alexander going on about how sick he is of her. Then she cuts both of them loose.Suddenly Alexander can't live without her. And she crumbles at his feet.Then she thinks about it and starts playing hard to get. but only for a moment.I love Diana Palmer(Susan Kyle, Diana Blayne) I have every book she wrote. This book turns the pages by it self."
4,Great traditional hymns sung in the classical country style,"I first bought this collection at a retail store for a Christmas present for my aunt. She loves it and actually wants to find another set for my grandmother. It's definitely a collection for those who enjoy listening to the ""old"" classical/western style country music. It's a collection of traditional hymns which I enjoy because I can sing along with it. If you are more into the contempory style Christian music this collection is not for you but if you want traditional old country church style hymns, you'll love this collection."
4,Lepers & Lunacy,"Kenneth J. Herrman's semi-autobiographical first person account of an American's experience in modern central Vietnam in both intriguing and educational. A war veteran's return to Vietnam, to make peace with a himself, inadvertently leads to his making peace with the country he once helped destroy. In the process of building personal relationships in Vietnam, Mr. Herrman ends up creating a university program at the college he teaches social work at, in Western New York, that fosters an understanding between two countries that were once at odds. In the process of telling this unique story, Mr. Herrman describes the cultural differences, social codes, and business ethics of Vietnam, a country that is so commonly misunderstood. This book is perfect for anyone who is either considering studying in Vietnam, or intends to do business there."
4,Why did I wait so long,"Even though I have been a sci fi fan for the longest time, and I was aware that Blade Runner was based on a book by PKD, it took more than 20 years to pick up a book. I decided to star with these shirt stories and not only was I not disappointed, I can ow count in my collection 5 additional books. These shirt stories stand the test of time and demonstrate what a visionary PKD was. It brought back memories of my first sci fi movies and at the same time astounded me with the futuristic vision and character development. If you have not read PKD and you love sci fi, do yourself a favor and get these book."
4,Good selection of sci fi short stories,"This is a good place to start reading Philip Dick. From his writing you can tell his main concerns were war and also machines taking over. My absolute favorite story, though, is The Eyes Have It. Very witty look at how it would be to take things literally how they are written. Enjoy!"
4,Great for short stories,"If you already like PKD, you will like this collection of short stories. For a sci-fi newbie, this may not be a good place to start since his stories may feel dated. It' s a good collection and a great value on kindle."
3,Misleading Title,"This is hardly ""The Best of Philip K. Dick""- this is just a collection of those of his stories available in the public domain. They are still good stories, and worth a couple bucks- but you can get them free, individually, elsewhere."
4,Nice set of short stories,"The short stories are nice, well written, and if you replace the word Soviet with Chinese/Arab or any other ""acceptable to you"" villain the book will feel more familiar to you.The collection is a bit repeated with some stories' end predictable after reading the previous one, but that is because it appears that the theme collected in this set is all the same."
4,Just love Phillip K. Dick!,"The Adjustment Bureau turned me on to the amazing works of Phillip K. Dick. Love it all. There seems to be this hidden, mysterious hint of romance and a person's genuine character involved. His work is fantastic."
2,Typical for Nazareth during the 1980's,"During the 1980's Nazareth had problems with their musical direction. The former hard rock approach changed a bit and that resulted in a bunch of uneven albums to say the least. ""The catch"" is no exception! Singer Dan McCafferty said that Nazareth on this album from 1984 tried to go Techno, but the result wasn't successful. Although the album can not be compared to any effort from the 1970's, it's not all bad. The song ""Last exit Brooklyn"" with its driving bass is rather appealing, and so is ""You don't believe in us"". For old time sake Nazareth throws in a rocker: ""Sweetheart tree"". And their cover of Rolling Stones' ""Ruby tuesday"" is alright. Many songs are just mediocre, like ""Moondance"" and ""Road to nowhere"", but the opening ""Party down"" is so horrible I can't find the words. I would say that ""The catch"" is for dedicated fans only."
2,is this Nazareth??,"Umm, is this Nazareth?? The only way you can tell this is Nazareth is by the vocalist Dan McCafferty, the music is completely different, at first listen I didn't really care for this CD, but a couple more listens I actually like A couple of the songs. ""This Month's Messiah"" is one that actually sounds like Nazareth, another song is ""Ruby Tuesday"" This CD is only for the true, devout Nazareth fans that must have all of their stuff,........"
3,Good Hard Rock album but not outstanding,"Nazareth has done the hard-rock formula again. This album is more akin to ""HAIR OF THE DOG"" days...Unlike ""FOOL CIRCLE"", ""2XS"" and ""NO JIVE"" albums, this album is repetitive and uninspired hard rock.Two songs worth listening to are ""RUBY TUESDAY"" and ""MOONDANCE"". The beat are great and these songs really rocks!! So if you're causal fans or ballad lover, try ""FOOL CIRCLE"" Or ""NO JIVE"". Or just buy one of their ""GREATEST HITS"" albums."
1,VHS RULES (for this release),"First off, I don't have the dvd version, and I will not be buying it. The reason being: the track listing is the same as the VHS tape that came out 20 years ago!! I still have my VCR & this tape in my collection, it sounds & looks great to these 39 year old eyes. I can't bring myself to spend money on this when the fans have been waiting for 20 years for a video collection from this terrific band, and there's nothing new on this. If one additional video was included, they would have gotten my money. Lord knows there's plenty of promo videos that aren't included on this compilation. Five songs from the 1st album, ""Up The Creek"", ""If You Need Me"", ""Woke Up With A Monster"", ""You're All I Wanna Do"", ""Say Goodbye"", ""That '70's Song"", & ""Sick Man of Europe"". Not to mention an unending list of tv appearances, etc... AFTER 20 YEARS, throw the fans a bone!"
2,Ho Hummm,I am an engineer and writer. I have quite a few books on editing. This one is NOT in my top 10.
4,The Jury is Out -- Permanently !,"The verdict in New York City is ""Not Guilty!"" Any judge and jury that doesn't see it that way will meet quick death at the hands of ""The Sign of the Scar"". Naturally, THE SPIDER stops them. This one is worth it for the great illustration of THE SPIDER rising up out of a coffin to gun down the bad guys."
3,Lots of information,"I find this book useful, however it is missing one important item, all of the forms need to be put on a CD that accompanies the book. There is lots of good information throughout the book."
4,If you've enjoyed the story so far...,Rest assured this one is still good.But due to the quality of the book itself I'd recommend waiting for a buy three get one sale.
3,Detailed book on discovering Acadia,"I've used this book on a couple of trips to Acadia. It's best feature is the detailed pull-out map in the back which shows all the major hiking trails. This is a great book to study BEFORE your trip. It has very detailed descriptions of hiking and biking trails and paddling and sea kayaking trips. It's great to pick out the activities you want to do, but this detailed nature makes it less useful on the trail though. It's too wordy and too bulky. (Take the map with you though!) It would be better if it had more pictures of the different areas. It's also missing mini-maps of each hiking or biking trail. Instead, you're left to pull out the map and try to follow along based on their descriptions. It would be great if this book were split into two, one for hiking and biking and one for paddling and sea kayaking, each in color with more pictures and terrain maps. Until then, there's still a lot of great info in this edition."
1,the cover of the book was cut,The book cover was cut as well as many pages up into the first chapter. The book was listed as very good like new. The book reeked with smoke. I am allergic to smoke. I was very disappointed.
3,Not as good as it makes out;),"I thought this would be a miricle product, but doesnt work as well as i had hoped.Watch out as it bleaches, so dont go to bed with it on if you have good bedding!!!Also it says not to rub in the cream...its kinda hard not too! and it bleaches little marks on your face where the cream was.I think its purely an expensive form of peroxide."
5,Good Stuff,"This is a great single to buy but not the best. If your a true Vines fan like me, you will know the good stuff. if you have all the studio cds already, it is always cool to hear the demos of the songs like the ones included on this one, Gross out and Going Gone. This also features one of the best versions of their debut single Get Free. it is slowed down and much better than the original and live versions. I would recommend getting this single just for that version of Get Free."
4,Kenko Telplus PRO300 3X for Minolta AF Cameras,"From Instruction Sheet:The KENCO Teleplus PRO300 can be attached only to thefollowing lenses.1. Single-focal-length-lenses of 200mm or greater.2. Zoom lenses with greater focal length over 200mmFor example:Minolta Hi-Speed AF Apo Telezoom 80-200mm f/2.8GTokina AF80-400 f/4.5-f/5.63.

1,Does not fit '08 Toyota Highlander (3.5L),...Despite what Amazon and Kragen think. Not even close -- it's an entirely different style. Do not buy this for '08 HL.
3,"Some good ideas, but very dry","This is a very detailed look at certain aspects of SF - specifically, its 'ideology', including the idea of genius, the (perceived) danger of women, and the genre's love for aliens, robots and monsters. The age of the stories ranges from the earliest SF to the 1960s, which limits the scope of the book somewhat since great changes have occurred in the genre since 1970.The quality of the writing is far from inspiring, but the case it argues is sound and rather persuasive. Not essential for every SF fan, but certainly worth a look."
2,Piece of Crap!1,"As cute as it looked in the picture it wasnt that way in person-First off, it was poorly packaged and the tail was deattached-Since this was a gift for someone's b-day(a bulldog lover) and it was coming up soon I didnt want to bother w/ the hassle of returning it-I fixed the tail myself w/ a hot glue gun-The clock was loose and was on the verge of falling out when i put the battery in-The dog was dark and the eyes looks sick and nothing like the picture-The tail was SUPPOSED to wag back and forth but since it was too heavy it didnt do it-Overall, it was an OK gift but could have been a lot better- BUY if absolutely necessary!Sorry, but it wasnt that great to be honest-The Plush Webkinz Bulldog was adorable tho- Check out that review by me!!"
4,At a pace that draws the reader in,"The novel begins with a British informant to Russia who exposes weaknesses in England. The protagonist, a British special operations detective, investigates the death of a Russian infiltrator. His mission is to thwart a Russian coup to subvert the British parliament towards Marxism, by electing a sympathetic to the Left president. This will of course serve to weaken Europe and strengthen Russia. The tide is already moving toward socialism, and the arms race is the answer. There are many plants, but ultimately, the hunt is for the top dog, Russian infiltrator; and the Brits have their own, unconventional spy.Forsyth keeps a pace that draws the reader in. A fascinating read of detective work.True to life here in America; we have(had) avowed Marxists working under the executive.God blessScott"
5,Great read,Fantastic cold war thriller. I occasionally had to set it down due to the intensity. A slow but hot burn.
3,Too Political,"I found the book to be too political and hard to follow at times. Being set in the 80's , I felt I couldn't relate to it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A spy thriller set in the Philby, Burgess and Maclean era of MI5.Here, a thief happens to discover secret documents outlining a plot to get a very hard left pro-Soviet government elected in the United Kingdom.With Philby involved, not just by your usual democracy, either, of course, so, fun and games for an MI5 agent who has been involved in investigating this far left sort of thing.The title of the novel refers to a nuclear treaty."
4,Views on Fourth Prtocol,Well written. Plausible storyline and plot. Characters weel portrayed. Good spellbinding stuff! Brings the co;d war days vividly back to memory.
1,The Fourth Protocol opinion,"I have read nerly all of Forsyth's books and until The Fourth Protocol was pleasantly entertained. This book, however, has too many characters that are hard to keep up with, has rambling plots and is so detailed that it is difficult to maintain an interest. Sadly, this is the one book that he has written that should be left on the shelf."
4,good read,"True to fashion, there are unforeseen twists and turns here. Historically acurate (as far as one could tell). Somewhat unbelievable plot, but entertaining. Definitely a good cold war era story."
5,it works!,"I took a chance on this item, thinking that it may or may not work on the particular Kong toys that my dog has. I have only used it, so far, on theKONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red. It cleans it perfectly, so I expect it to work just fine on the other Kong items."
5,Just what I needed,"I have 3 Kongs - 2 large and one extra-large. The big one was easier to clean out, but the large size kept having food stuck up toward the small end. This cleaning brush worked perfectly! the brush is shaped exactly like the interior of the Kong and once inserted, it cleans out any residue left by the dogs. It works well on the big one, too. The little mini-brush in the handle inserts into the top end of the Kong and frees up anything left there. I was concerned because one reviewer said that the handle broke when using it. I haven't found any problem with it, but I do use it with care after reading that review. The suction cup on the bottom is a bonus. I just slap it onto the sink when I'm done to have it drain dry."
1,Sorry Excuse For History,"This book is a very poor example of scholarship. Bradford attempts to impose his hackneyed ideological theory on the men of the revolutionary and founding generation. He attacks such brilliant scholars as Bernard Bailyn for having the audacity to base his work on reality. In the place of past interpretations, Bradford invents an almost laughable concept of ""Old Whig"" thought, which in all truthfulness seems to have been made up out of thin air. I could go on and on about the horrible failings of this work, but that is not necessary. Instead, I will only point the potential reader of this work to true works of ideological scholarship, those of Bailyn, Gordon Wood, Caroline Robbins, H. Trevour Colbourn, Pauline Maier et al. While these works are not perfect, they are far superior to Bradford's brand of puerile revisionism."
3,This is what it reprints,"It reprints all of the Neal Adams stories in chronological order. Vol #2 includes Detective Comics #393-411, Batman #217,219-222,224-227,229-231, Brave and the Bold #88-90,93,95, and World's Finest #199,200,202."
1,Holy over saturation Batman!!,"I'm not sure if they fixed this, but will I not recommmend this second volume. the colors inside are just too saturated and overpower neal adams wonderful artwork. This is a shame since most Adams recent reprinted works have been pretty good (Deadman collection and Batman volume one). I would think that this is a printing error on DC's part as the colors look too dark for me and artwork gets lost sometimes; I maybe wrong though.What's most interesting is this volume has not been selling in my area; in fact it went on sale not too long ago; the shop had so many these. it may be a neal adams book, but if it's not done right well watch out."
2,Zzzzzzzzz.,Love Firth and Branagh but a bit of a snooze feat as far as I'm concerned. Somehow missed the point of it all.
4,The movie was really good but....,"I knew that this movie was in PAL (Region 2) format, which is incompatible with DVD players in the U.S. and Canada (Region 1). However, a previous reviewer said that the movie could be viewed on a computer, so I ordered it and was in fact able to see it on my computer. (When I put the DVD in my computer to play, a screen appeared saying that it was incompatible but gave the option of switching over to the District 2 format. With a couple of mouse clicks, I was able to watch the movie and enjoyed it very much.) Now for the bad news: Before switching formats, a screen appeared warning that one is allowed to change from one format to another only four times. If I had known this I probably would not have bought the DVD. However, as an avid Firth fan, I'm glad I got to see it."
4,excellent acting!,"The book rates among my absolute favourites - which counts only a handfull. I enjoyed watching the film as it captures the moods and tones of the book so brilliantly - especially thanks to the excellent acting performances. However, the film's leaving out details such as the summer outing and the sudden going away of the Keaches somehow seemed to distract from the superbly well balanced story conveyed by the book. And I'm not quite sure which style and period the mural in the film would be! A nice film for a melancholic afternoon."
1,A Month In the Country,"Well, we read the book and loved it. However, somehow in ordering I managed to miss that the DVD I ordered was Region 2. I got it, opened it and couldn't play it. That is the first time I've run into that problem. However, due to a kind Amazon Friend, I have discovered that I can indeed play it on my computer. Not the most convenient way to do it, but better than nothing. I look forward to updating this review when I have had a chance to watch it."
4,A Definite Addition to the Home Library!!,"A good portrayal by Colin Firth and Kenneth Branagh of what soldiers encountered after returning from war. I loved watching Tom Birkin's (Colin Firth) stutter slowly fading as his work progresses on uncovering an ancient painting on the wall of a church. A church in which he has to live in and where the rector's wife shows him more than a required amount of attention. When he isn't thinking of her, his nightmares of war haunt him. I was thrilled with everyone's performances. I believe the director of this film also directed ""Circle of Friends"". Colin Firth appeared in a minor role in that film, also. And, another connection in ""AMITC"" is the circuit preacher appeared in ""Shakespeare In Love"" with Colin Firth. And, the rector's wife in ""AMITC"", Natasha Richardson, played with Colin in the HBO film, ""Hostages"". I recommend these films, also."
5,Flawed but Wonderful,"The film of A Month in the Country is a lovely rendition of the novel. Unfortunately, much of the plot is left behind. In order to really appreciate the story and the performances, get the little novel and read it first. It enhances the film beautifully.Brannagh and Firth do first rate jobs throughout.Especially in the pub scene."
4,Wonderful Story; Film misses plot points but acting brilliant.,"I won't repeat the other rave comments about the film because I agree with them. First, though, the problem with this film is that it isn't completely true to the novel and drops important plot points. Therefore, it becomes rather obtuse. However, it's brilliant for what it is. Read the book and see the film and all your problems are solved! (And the book is so short, it won't take but a moment to read and is well worth lingering over.) The scene that I found the most moving -- one that hasn't been mentioned yet -- is the close conversation between Firth and Branagh in the pub in the village. Branagh is wilting into his beer in a private moment when Firth sees him and joins him at table. Branagh is literally incurably sad and, in a moment of raw honesty, tells Firth why. When he bemoans the futility of war medals, my heart breaks a little bit. His eyes fill with tears and so do mine.Oh, see this film!!! But, read the book first."
1,It stinks,"I bought this cd awhile ago thinking it was the real songs, but they're nothing but chessy remakes that sound awful. Its hard to tell that these are remakes until you open it and listen to it since the group...the countdown singers have small fine print on the back. The only song on here I dont mind is Da Funk from The Saint, but if I were you I'd take my money and buy the real songs on the real movie soundtracks. Even if you do have to pay more money. At least that way it will be worth it."
5,A perspective from a native,"This book is a masterpiece of solid research and years of hard, diligent effort. Thank you for writing this book.I read the work from an entirely different perspective than most. This was home for a number of years. Unlike many history books, this book is an easy and enjoyable journey. More so, if you know the town. Names, places, and historical events are put in perspective for the reader. At times, I felt like I was walking in the footsteps of the founders from the ""Big Field"" to the current town square.Do read the companion work about Francois Valle. While Ste. Genevieve never grew to the stature of St. Louis, it's historical and economic importance at the time is undeniable.If you wish to know more about the lives and times of the people in this area before it was part of the USA, it's a great place to start.Thanks again for an enjoyable book!"
3,A colonial tragi-comedy,"""Mister Johnson"", by Joyce Cary, is a tale of an intriguing, quixotic native character, set in colonial Nigeria. Cary draws on his own experiences as a colonial official in Nigeria, drawing a rich, topical, authentic picture of the country during the early thirties. The eponymous anti-hero, referred to only as ""Johnson"", is a pathetic creation who sees himself as an enthusiast for Empire, a champion of progress and civilisation, with the King of England numbering among his friends. In reality, he is despised by his European boss, Rudbeck, as a member of an inferior race. Johnson's life, his attempt to to become more English than the English, is set precariously between these two extremes -- the urgings of superiority and the reality of degradation, eventually leading him to the gallows. The story's culmination, involving larceny, treachery and murder, sees Johnson emerging as a pathetic but genuinely human creation, whose plight is an illustration of a genuine human dilemma."
3,Mister Johnson - stage play,"Spotted this on the site and thought it was the novel - the jacket is not clear it is the Broadway stage play. The jacket should be clear on the contents, as the authorship is different from the novelMister Johnson"
5,hours of fun for any age,My two year old nephew and my one year old have this toy and they love all the buttons and it keeps them busy and independent.
5,Just beautiful songs,"I did not know Kathy Troccoli was a ""Christian"" singer when I bought this album. In fact, I had never heard of her. I bought it because I heard ""If I'm Not In Love"" on the radio and was swept away. It remains one of my favorite songs of any artist. What a lovely, clear, powerful voice! I became so mesmerized, it was easy to feel she was right there singing to me. Although I bought it for this one song, the whole CD has grown on me. Only looking back, did I realize some of the songs are ""Christian"". To me, they are songs of love, feelings, and emotion. You don't need to be Christian to enjoy this, nor do you have to be a guy. I strongly sense that Ms. Troccoli should do more albums such as this, even if they are not traditional Troccoli. Who knows, maybe she will win over some new hearts."
2,Kathy WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO...,"Being a Kathy Troccili fan, I still found it very difficult to get into this album. It is oversythesized and I am not sure what she is trying to accoplish. I guess it is good for the collector or die hard fan but for those of us who like her christian albums or the present this cd is very disappointing."
5,"Great Service, Okay Book about GWTW","I was a very happy customer, indeed, when I received this book and added it to my ever growing books on the making of GWTW. Much of this book, including the photos, have been used several times in other works on the making of GWTW so I missed having a lot of fresh material. But still, the movie GWTW still exerts a powerful hold over today's movie fans, even though it's now nearly 75 years old!"
1,Bad,"Product was described to be in good condition, but the dust jacket was torn and the pages very old. Not satisfied at all."
5,Wow,"Arrons music is like an angel singing, his voice doesn't look like it comes from him but it does... He does alot of gospel music and it really hits home.. Would like to get his Christmas CD as well... Well worth the money..."
1,Don't waste your money. False advertising.,"Please pocket your money. Don't shell it out on this book. This book is ALL about using the extrude feature in your 3D program. Extrude this, extrude that. It's tutorials are also VERY unclear and leave you hanging in the dark with unanswered questions. It uses awful, uninspiring art for sample work throughout the tutorials. You're better off learning on your own, experimenting with the controls and what not. What a ""lie"" . The title is very misleading. I am never buying anything from that publishing company ever again."
2,In serious need of an update,"This book would have been relevent in 1995, but lots have changed in the game modeling world since then. The really weird thing about the book is the fact that they are working entirely in triangles instead of quads. It's close to impossible to really see your mesh flow and get proper ""edge looping"" in areas like the shoulders and knees, an issue not even mentioned in the book. The models may look nice, but when rigged, they will move like crap. Deformation is not even mentioned and like the above reviews state, all the pages talk about ""Extruding"" the edge profile. That's just a start. What about poly clean-up and edge spacing? You could easily trim this book down to about 10 pages. I recommend GAME CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WITH MAYA(even for max users) instead because Antony Ward goes into ""deformation testing"" while modeling a character with proper edge loops."
2,well-written incoherence,"""The Cannibal"" is an engaging, flowing novel that is also completely flat (in character and description) and jumpy, with no emotional involvement and even less dialogue (if that's a gesture of defiance toward literary convention, it certainly doesn't work). Is it possible for a book to be completely incoherent and confusing during and after reading, but still keep your finger on the next page? Apparently so, as this is certainly not the worst book I've read. It's unmemorable, sure, but John Hawkes at least exhibits a style that's free of the outright pretension that befalls authors like Pynchon and DeLillo. Interpret it how you may: ""The Cannibal"" is a book about nothing (maybe incoherence and WWII), but it is well-written, therefore it avoids a one-star rating."
1,Pretentious crap,"John ""Look At Me, I'm Writing!"" Hawkes' tries his best to be ""literary."" The previous reviewer calls this book difficult. It's difficult because it's unreadable. Hawkes has no idea what he's doing, so he just makes everything as obscure as he possibly can in hopes it will impress somebody. The emperor has no clothes. Don't bother with this pointless tripe."
2,Low cost at the expense of durability,"The best thing going for the shoe is the low cost. They certainly wil function for wrestling shoes but they are cheap and will start to fall apart in one season. The velcrow lace tuck is junk and the stitching is falling apart, but I have used them for 2 seasons coaching. Time to pick up some asics, they have always been durable."
4,Swing to the right,"I didn't realize when I was in high school how these songs would follow me in life. Brilliant; atypical Todd Rundgren. Though basically anti-establishment, some may notice some songs have been used by major companies (i.e. Nissan among others) in ads of the past ten years. A sleeper in the best sense. You should have this in your CD collection. A precursor to bands such as BNL and Phish, Utopia's sense and sendiments can be shared and felt by all who listen."
3,A period piece?,"Recording from 1981-82, the beginning of the Reagan presidency. It's not really an indictment on our 40th president. Rather, it's a regurgitation of liberal fears of what a Reagan administration would be like: war (""Lysistrata""), the elimination of the welfare safety net (""Only Human""), corporate greed (""Last Dollar"", ""Love of Money"", the title cut), and censorship (""Fahrenheit 451""). History reveals that Utopia were better artists than prognosticators (don't quit your ""Day Job"", Todd!). It's hard to argue with the tunes, however, many of which are infectious, and almost convincing (almost!). Which proves that, by definition, rock music is ""feel"" music, best served from the left."
5,Orange/Black raincoat,"Length:: 4:35 MinsParcel arrived on estimated day (Three days in U.K Customs for clearence)Again 17.88 added to cost of this coat for customs clearence so this coat cost approx GBP 80 (Coat+postage+clearence)I ordered XL coat and fits well.The coat is 50 inches long and comes well past my knees (I am 5 feet 11 inches tall"")The poppers on the coat feel sturdy and are tight to fasten and unfasten.(This is not a critisism)The coat feels light to wear and well sized. I bought the size XL and when being worn there is plenty of room under the coat for a jacket to be wornVideo to follow shortly of this coat being worn.Worn in gusty winds as shown in this little video.Coat is windproof and warm when being worn"
2,Almost Impossible To Read Text; Light Grey on White Doesn't Work,My title says it all. The text is light grey and almost impossible to read. I would not have bought this book if I had been aware. Is there a possibility of a refund?
4,Nice little rumble pak.,"This is a nice rumble pak, like many others out there. However, this one offers a memory card feature, as well as two vibration settings. If you tend to get knocked around a whole lot in the game, maybe you'd like the first setting. If you want to really feel the kickback of your shotgun in another game, use the second setting."
1,game pak,This product never got a chance to work. Put batteries in it and didn't turn on or work at all. Really disappointed. Wasn't worth the money to send it back. Don't recommmend.
2,Cute but not practical,"The red is not set in, and smudges. The sheets are nice flannel. I'd go with a solid color next time."
4,History of Early Texas,"Professor Anderson has written a highly detailed account of early Texas history. His research and relating of detail is superb! I have found details in his book never seen before anywhere. He does have a strong bias in his writing that leans toward the native American's point of view (which is fine), and against various ""white"" men and groups (Texas rangers mainly). Overlooking this minor complaint, his book is excellant, and I am glad to have it as a reference. Not a ""light read"" at all, very detailed, almost like reading a thesis. Congratulations to Prof. Anderson for a well documented, well researched book. (the only claim I found objectionable thus far on page 127 where he claims Plains Indian societies never shot down women and children among their own....not true...see the Harrell archaeological site in Texas)"
1,"Objection to the term ""ethnic cleansing""","The term ethnic cleansing is widely misused today. The proper term in this title would be genocide. Ethnic cleansing was used by Serbs in Bosnia to define what they felt they were doing, getting rid of people of the same race who had converted to Islam and, in the eyes of the Serbs, gone over to the enemy side, committing racial treason. Whether or not one agrees with the Serbs, they had a specific meaning for the term. The adoption by so many today in the news media and academia of the term ""ethnic cleansing"" as a synonym for genocide shows, in my opinion, a lack of clear thinking about terms."
5,Great product!,"I'm on my third jar. Works great! I use to do IPL treatments every six months,but no more! I use this cream twice a day. It did take about two months for the first jar to work, so be patient."
1,don't waste your time & money,"I have been using this for about 10 months, applying it 3 times a day. It does not do anything."
2,Why so much for a VHS?,"Even though this is a good movie, it seems really steep in price for a VHS.Yes, it is very good, but why so high Amazon? Please market this in DVD and affordable."
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM - I DID NOT GET ANY ANSWERS TO 2 EMAILS SENT TO THE SHIPPER EITHER,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM - I NEVER RECEIVED ANY ANSWER TO TWO EMAILS I SENT TO THE SHIPPER
1,Seller never sent item,"I would love to sit here and tell you how wonderful this pin remover is, but I never received it. I have contacted the seller and no response from them! I do not suggest you do business with this seller."
2,Not suitable for purpose intended,"Although the connection fits the Garmin I have, the original mount it came with had a speaker in it and this does not. The speaker in the Garmin handheld unit itself is not loud enough to be heard when on the windshield and therefore not really suited for its purpose. Mine broke irreparably after a month. If you REALLY need something to mount your old Garmin, this will work. Just keep in mind, there will be more visual involved as you will have a hard time hearing the voice instructions."
3,A mid-range Star Trek novel.,"This book was well-written, with a goodly amount of excitement, had some interesting characters among the non-regulars, and did a passable if not great job of capturing the personalities of the regulars. The main plot situation seemed a bit forced; I find it hard to believe that Kirk & company would have gotten themselves into that situation, and equally hard to believe that the way out that they found was truly the best solution that they could find, but all in all it was an enjoyable if unremarkable read. As usual, John Vornholt did a fine job on the mechanics of writing, but the idea wasn't really one of his best."
2,You won't get this model!,"This has been replaced, unknown to Aubuchon, with the 6113 model. It is brushed stainless on top and the plates have the grill ridges, like a Foreman. They were very nice about it when I called them, are issuing a full refund and told me to keep the product. However, I'm still on a quest to find a reasonably priced machine with flat plates. If you were to grill something really greasy on here in the open grill position, like ground beef, the grease would overflow as the ""drip"" area around the plates are not very deep. Also, the plates don't fit very tightly, so your grease could wind up under the plate in the electrical area. If you order this I would suggest using only in the closed position for sandwiches."
1,"2 years and it is already broken, with light use",Just very bad reliability for this type of product. We should expect a MTBF of at least 5 years. Very disappointing.
4,Good Overview,"This is a good overview of the history of humans and hominids, supported by ample photos and illustrations, with most of the issues and conflicts at least touched upon."
5,Absolutely essential,The photography is absolutely stunning. The book is separated into two parts 1) Central Issues of Paleoanthropology 2) Encountering the Evidence. This is the single best book on hominid evolution.
5,"Surprisingly good music for a ""parody"", novel concept.","I would rate the music four+ stars, and the concept and production five stars. It is remarkable at how Beatlesque the instrumentation and production is, while each song weaves in an interesting variation of a familiar Beatles melody. Like other reviewers have stated, it is quite enjoyable to play this CD for other people and see if they can match each tune here with a Beatles tune.Those who may see some kind of mockery in this need to keep in mind that Todd Rundgren's 1976 ""faithful"" had two Beatles covers, and more recently, Todd toured with Ringo Starr's band and also did a George Harrison tribute album.Having liked the Beatles quite a bit, I find this to be a Utopia favorite of mine as well."
5,Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant,"What can you say? Todd can do it all, and here he presents a loving, somewhat smart-mouthed exercise in songwriting. Proving that he really can write and produce any type of song, he brilliantly recreates the types of songs Paul, John, and George wrote at different stages in their Beatle careers. That alone is a gift, displaying intimate familiarity with the minutia of the Beatles recordings. The album will be a treat for any Beatles fan. It's a great record, works on many levels, and once again shows the world that Todd remains one of our supreme musical artists, a Wizard a True Star. Power Pop lives on!"
4,Outstanding in their field...,"... is what it says on the back of the LP.This is Todd and his chums writing and recording their own Beatles album , hence the ""With the Beatles"" cover. Todd is ""John"" and contributes the best song, ""Everybody Else is Wrong.""The whole album is fun, and easily demonstrates that Mr R's songwriting and performing abilities bear comparison with the best of the best.I'm not sure it tries to repay the Fabs, as Neil Innes' ""Archeology"" certainly does, but what it takes is worth buying and listening to repeatedly."
3,It has a different actual color from the pics...,This is my second pair of Fanning... for some reason the pic has a lighter hue of brown while the actual is kind of chocolate in color... Im a little disappointed because it looks like the first pair I got.. lolI wonder what's the actual color of the 3rd pair I ordered.. hmm..
5,i love these shoes,these are the best flip flops u can buy for 50 bucks. super comfortable and supportive. they take a couple weeks to break in but when they do they are great. very sturdy and dont slip easily. plus everyone gets a kick out of the bottle opener. my first pair lasted me about 5 years and these are the only shoes i wear in the summer.
5,most comfortable,Reef flip flops for the most comfortable I've ever worn. there is only flops I wear and they out last any other 2 to 1
4,3rd pair and going,"I walk heavy on the heel and I can blow out the heel on an average pair of sandals in a matter of weeks. I am not convinced that there is actually air in these heels but either way they are super sturdy. This is the 3rd pair of Fannings I have bought and I will never buy a different pair of sandals ever. This particular pair, the dark brown, has warn a little quicker in the heel and toe that previous pairs I have owned but I have also worn the S$%t out of these. Seriously, during the summer I wear them every day and for the most part these are bullet proof, and super comfortable.Thats why I keep buying them..."
5,Reef Sandals,I was very happy with the fast service I received and the gift was received with much surprise as it has a can opener on the bottom of the shoe. I continue to use Amazon because i have never had any bad service yet.!!
2,blisters,"Love the look of the sandals, but they rubbed the area raw between the big toe and second toe on my left foot and rubbed an area raw on the top left portion on my right foot."
3,Not so comfortable,I purchased these sandals for my son who was not completely satisfied because he complained of them being too tight and narrow for him to slip on. And so could not wear them for a long period of time.
1,REEFS SUCK! SIR BLACK FEET! ZERO STARS!,"REEFS SUCK, LOOK AT MY PIC. Took a pair of Reef's to Costa Rica. Everytime they got wet in the ocean the straps left huge black marks on my feet. This wasn't like a one time thing. EVERY TIME THEY GOT WET. Complete garbage for an expensive pair of sandals. It looked like I had a crazy foot disease. An it was hard to wash off. Anyways, I threw the reefs in the trash where they belong and got myself a pair of Kustoms. Cheaper, lighter, more comfortable and NO MORE BLACK FEET. I put up a picture of my stained black feet. REEFS SUCK! Oh and you look like a jack@$$ using a sandal to open your beer."
3,Reed Men's Leather Fanning Sandal,"I bought these online through Amazon.com for a friend because it has the built-in bottle opener on the sole of the sandal and he absolutely loves them, they are comfortable, durable and very useful. I recommend these sandals to anyone."
1,Not for US consumption.,"I was interested in buying a pair of these sandals since my dog ate one of my sperrys. While perusing the list of styles I noticed that they had two styles that included the colors of the mexican flag. However I saw no style that offered the red, white and blue colors for us US patriotic Americans. Nuff Said!!!"
1,Biggest P.O.S. slippers out there!,"Horrible quality, completely fell apart in 6 months. Broke in, and realized they also make your feet smell like dirty dogs a** if .you get them wet. *note, when wet you will slip and slide.all over the place in addition to the foul smell that will present itself.More about the quality; front toe strap partially disconnected @ 4 months, side lower connection shortly thereafter. Cannot believe such catastrophic failures from what is supposed to be a good manufacture. I guess that's why I will be going back to purchasing only rainbow or olulukai sandles as Reef has gone gimmick over quality.* on that note, be careful! The novel placement of metal ""church key"" beer opener in the slippers arch can cause you to lose control and eat serious s#$t when descending stairs, ladders etc, especially wood or metal! ""Stay on your toes"" so to speak!"
1,Poor product,I've long been a fan of reef sandals but this model it terrible. The soles have separated/split apart after two months of wear.
4,Great sandal,Very comfortable and great looking sandal would buy this product again.Nice support and the sole has a nice grip which you don't get with most flip flops.
5,comfort and quality,I have had these sandals for a month now and all I could say is that they were worth it! I bought them mainly because of my plantar fasciitis and it has helped with reducing heel and sole pain. They provide great comfort and I am very pleased with the product!
4,Very comfortable,These sandals are very comfortable and well fabricated. It would be nice to have some arch support to make them more comfortable to wear for longer periods. I'm looking forward to using them all summer.
4,Super Comfortable,"These Reef flip flops are some of the most comfortable sandals you can buy. They have a ton of designs, so it's just a matter of picking out a pair that you like. On the down side, I could do without the collegiate bottle opener on the bottom of the shoe. That is stupid and gross. Plus, if you're that college and have a class ring, you should be opening beers with that. Otherwise find a bottle opener."
5,men's fannings,"GREAT FIT,COMFORTABLE. HUSBAND LOVES THESE.HE SAVES WEARING THESE FOR VACATION SO I BOUGHT ANOTHER PAIR.GREAT PRICE FOR CHRISTMAS GIFT."
4,Comfortable Sandals,"Definitely like these sandals. Very comfortable to wear. Did get dirty easily, not sure how well they will clean. Overall, glad I purchased them."
3,A bit uncomfortable.,"It may be that they lack a 9.5 option, but the strap is too tight and digs into your feet. Hopefully in time they will loosen. I would have ordered a 10, but in the past a 10 gets too loose. Maybe they should think about offering more options."
5,Very comfortable and fun,"Got for my husband for Father's Day. He has a job where he's on his feet all dayand I wanted to get him something not only nice looking, but cushiony & comfortable as well,mission accomplished. These are also kinda fun, they have a bottle opener on the bottomof each sandal. My daughters and I may get a pair also ;)Will definitely buy from this seller again.Received quickly. I highly recommend."
3,Reef sandal black/silver,"The sandal is very sturdy, but a little tight on top and am not wild about the feel between the toes, they need to use a different material, it is kind of irritating."
2,Pay attention lots of FAKE reviews!!!,"I bought these based on the high number of reviews and high ratings, but I was in for a surprise. You see this sandals that everyone's ""husband"" and ""boyfriend"" likes so much and that last ""for 10 years"" (just check the reviews and you'll know what I mean). Aren't all THAT good.They are a bit large, first I ordered a Size 11 (my normal size) then had to exchange them for a pair size 10. Both times they were shipped fast, no complaints there.The second pair had a good fit, but they make my toes bleed. After wearing them for only thirty minutes or so and some moderate walking around, I had a wound on the second toe on my left foot. The straps between the big and second toe is also quite uncomfortable and quite frankly a bit painful.Overall, I wouldn't call them total garbage, but certainly not that good and not worth the current price."
3,Very inaccurate sizing.,"Before purchasing these, I read several reviews and determined that these are often sized a bit small. As I normally wear a 12 or 12 shoe, I ordered the size 13. It was way too small, so I sent it back for a 14. The 14 I could get on, but it was still too small for comfort. As that's the largest size they sell, I'll be ordering another brand.These flip flops are also very hefty. The soles are very thick, and somewhat heavy. That may be a good or bad thing, depending on your desires. For me, it's a bad thing, as I'm looking for a lightweight pair of beach and shower flip flops to carry with me as I travel, and the added weight is not a welcome thing. If they had fit me, I would have kept them anyway.The construction appears solid, but as I have only worn them for about 30 seconds before shipping them back, I cannot comment on the true durability."
4,"great sandals, but watch out for the opener","I have had two pairs of these, comfy, last well. I just wanted to say that I would prefer they lose the silly bottle opener. I don't like to drink where I walk (or ..... where I eat, for that matter). These will also scratch boat decks and wood floors when they get worn down a little. On boat decks it's worse because there are curved surfaces where even new shoes will gouge the gelcoat or paint. Great way to get thrown overboard or not invited on subsequent fishing trips. They should include a nice aluminum bottle opener key chain instead, would cost them 0.10 if that."
5,one cool flipper,I ordered these for my 14 year old son. He loves them! It has a nice design and he likes the church key on the bottom
5,Comfort at best,I love my new sandals! So comfortable and I love I can open my beers with the bottle opener on the bottom.
4,Remarkably Comfortable,"I love these sandals and wear them all the time. A good portion of my friends have said they're unattractive, but that doesn't really matter to me considering how comfortable they are. I've not yet used the bottle opener on the bottom, but it's a pretty convenient tool if you don't have one otherwise.Just be warned, the sole WILL get very dirty unless you scrub it frequently."
4,Please with the purchase,"I am very pleased with the purchase of the Reef sandals. They are not as comfortable as I had hoped, but the convenience of the bottle opener on the bottom of the sandals makes it easy to overlook a LITTLE discomfort in the sandal. I would recommend these to a friend. They have been very popular among friends and family."
5,pop-top flip flop,"Who says you can't have your beer and drink it too? These are the most comfortable flip-flops I've ever owned, and I can open my bottles too!! I'm seriously considering getting another pair now in case they are discontinued!"
2,Uncomfortable,"I have owned many Reef sandals and was hoping to upgrade by going with a leather pair. The sizing ws accurate as always and they were also stylish, Unfortunately after the first mile of walking in them, the straps starting digging into the top of my feet causing blisters. I have not been able to wear them and plan on sending them back."
2,Sandal is 5 day of use and logos are fading already.,"I've used this sandals for like 5 days now, the reef logos in the back end of the sandal are already fading and looking really bad, like the sandal had like months of use.Also i ordered the black ones and they are getting to look like white dirt or something on the foam bed. I thought they would be more comfortable but not what i expected. This added to the fading logos make the sandal look like at least 1 year old.I should return these, im thinking. For the price, i definately got ripped off. I bought Adidas sandals in the past for the same price i got these, i still have them since Dec 2007 and wore them until i got these and they still look VERY good but i just thought it would be a good time to buy new sandals, either i was wrong or chose the wrong brand. =( Buyer beware."
3,Comfortable but not long lasting,"Was comfortable, the bottle opener option is not well thought out in my opinion...who wants to open a bottle of beer with the dirty underside of their sandal? The material was kind of hot in the sun and tended to make my feet sweat which is wierd for sandals. Leather sandals in my opinion are always better."
3,Had to be replaced under warranty,Reef Fanning Leather Flip Flops are very comfortable - unfortunately the leather straps did not hold up and the church keys bent easily - Product replaced under warranty by Reef - just cost me shipping
4,flip flops,I like them and I am wearing them to where ever I go and I feel they will last a long time. gug
2,Disappointed,"I have had multiple pairs of Reef sandals and love them. UNFORTUNATELY, this pair broke within a month or so, popped out just like the proverbial Jimmy Buffett song (stepped on a pop top, blew out my flip flop), color me disappointed on this purchase."
1,Good sandals while they lasted,These were very good sandals while they lasted. Mine lasted ~ten & one half months. The outer side strap on my right one became unattached from the sole - all three foci. It looks like they might have been glued. I did get them wet a couple of times. Mine cost U$42.31. I think I should have gotten more out of them than that. I can buy a lot of rubber flip flops for that money.
4,Really Comfortable,"The sandals feel great on your feet. They're even more comfortable than some sneakers that I own. Beware of sweat accumulating on the surface of the sandals though, other than that no complaints."
5,Feel Great,"I have never been a sandal wearer but gave these a try since some of my friends said they were so comfortable. They were right, I have quit wearing my shoes and socks during the warm seasons now as these are so comfortable. They did take about a week of wearing for the sandals to ""form"" to my feet but I was told to expect that. The bottle opener on the bottom has been the topic of more than a few conversations."
5,Always Wonderful -- I live in my Reefs!,"The Reef Fanning sandals have been my go-to shoes for 10 years if the weather cooperates. By now, I must have had 10 pairs, and I have worn them with pleasure. They are always comfortable, supportive, great looking, and fun. Also, the price was good, and the option for free and easy returns is a BIG plus."
2,ok i suppose,"I ordered these to replace a lost pair of reefs that i had for over 4 years with no issues. could not find the same style that i had but these appeared to be similar to them. these weigh at least twice that of my old pair. they are ok i suppose, one of the major issues with purchasing something online without finding them local to try on/touch first. another reason to only buy books or items that you have physically had contact with first from any online retailer. to much of a hassle to return items. bottle opener on sole may be interesting but only a drunk/stoned person would even consider using it to open anything they would be drinking from."
2,Not for tall feet,Way too tight a fit for size 12 foot. The sole size was fine but the vertical rise of the strap was probably made for a size 8 foot. Your manufacturer needs to know that when foot sizes get bigger it is not just in length but in thickness and height also. Unwearable.
3,Not as durable as previous reef sandle,"I bought a pair of Freddy P's reef sandals that lasted 3 years before finally breaking. I loved those shoes. At that point I had to get the Fanning's as the Freddy P's are no longer being made.The Fanning shoe has lasted me about 1 year, keeping in mind I did not wear them in the winter, The strap that goes in between your toes has started to come apart on both shoes. And they have become loose and not as comfortable.The bottle opener is to be used only if you have to.You have to take the shoe off to open beer, if you have already had a few beers standing on one leg can become a little tricky.I guess for $40 they are worth the price."
4,Beach Bum No More,"i bought these sandals after i found out at the beach party they had a bottle opener built-in..yes a must have. then i realized that they were very comfortable and you can walk in these all day with no back pain,for me this was fantastic! i recommend to all to have the comfort and the fun! Great product!"
4,A great all around sandal,when I first Got the sandals they where a little tight on the strap side and I could not slide my foot in like I have been able to with my other pairs. Other then the strap bieng tight the Fanning sandal felt really good on the bottom of my feet. I have been wearing them on and off for the past month or so now and they have broken in a bit still not able to slide my foot in and go but its getting better with time.These are alot better cushion then any of my past sandals. The bottle opener works wich is a plus but watch where you walk you can clog it up with some not so pleasent stuff that you wouldnt want around your drink. Overall A great sandal
1,sole fell off 1 day after return policy.,"Purchased these for a Caribbean cruise. On the last day of the 7 day cruise the sole fell off one shoe. I thought it wasn't a problem as I would return when I got home. When I went to return them, yesterday was the final day I could return for full refund. I have searched for someone to contact, but that info is not available. I liked the shoe, was very comfortable, but didn't last but 1 week. I would not recommend these if you expect them to last."
5,reef sandal,Great sandals. Bought as a gift for the second time. Receiver loved them. Sandals were exactly what he wanted down to the bottle opener on the bottom
4,Wonderful pool or beach flip,I purchased these sandals for beach/pool use for an aruban vacation. I was pleased with the quality. Would definitely purchase again.
4,Very good quality,I'm a big guy and my flipflops need to be supportive and strong. So far after a few weeks of daily wear I'm very happy. They are easy to clean and the heels are supportive but not squshy.
5,Reef's,"The reciepient was very pleased with these shoes. He particularly loved the bottle opener in the sole. Oh, and they are quite comfortable too."
3,Try at a store first!,"While my title says for you to try at store, i am not sure that wearing it for a few minutes will let you have a real feeling for this sandal.I got it a few weeks ago, and tried it for the first few times for at least a couple hours straight, just walking around in my town with my wife. I wasn't walking at a fast pace. After a couple hours i felt that it was hurting my feet, on top of my right foot. It is a beautiful sandal, but definitely not made to be at my feet for too long. Sad, i really wish i could take it would me on my trip to Europe in October."
4,Comfortable after breaking it in,"Very comfortable sandals after breaking it in for two weeks. The straps were very tight out of the box and caused pain in my foot after the first day. The leather straps loosen up over time and now has a better fit. The bottle opener causes the sandals to be slightly slippery on wet, uneven tiles such as the public bathroom near pools."
4,Surprisingly Comfortable,"I have something of a love hate relationship with flip flops. Generally I stick with the $10 cheap pairs and maybe make it through the summer. This year I decided to do a little more research, and spend a little more money. So far it's been worth it. These flops are surprisingly comfortable, even straight out of the box. The bottle opener is kinda gimmicky and awkward to use but other than that these are great."
5,Comfortable yet chic Sandal,The slippers are very comfortable and look very sleek. They're great to wear with Khaki and Tan shorts. They also go great with Brown tint jeans too. I want to get more in different colors.
4,Very Nice Flip Flop,"I just ordered a second pair for my alternate locale since I enjoyed the first.My only concern is the beer opener in the sole, a gimmick I don't need. I worry that as the sole wears it could scratch the floor, though when I look at how shoe soles wear, it's probably quite safe. Nevertheless it makes nervous; hence a cautionary 4 out of 5 stars.I got a 1/2 size larger than my shoe size, and they fit great; you may want to err upward a bit, too.I was also pleased with the width of the sandals, as I have a wider foot and noted a number of reviews of alternative sandals expressed concern with their narrowness; again, these fit perfectly."
5,Good Reviews from Young Adult,"I bought this book for my 20 y.o. son. We didn't discuss it much, but he said he really liked it."
2,Advice not for everybody,"First, this book is in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church. So this criticism is not intended to imply that this book is somehow heterodox, it is not.But frankly, the advice is not so good. It certainly does not apply to everyone. And some of the suggestions, frankly, left me scratching my head.I am a middle-aged man who finds himself single again, yet able to marry in the Catholic Church. Little of the suggestions or advice in this book apply to someone my age. And since I was married before, I can say that some of the suggestions regarding married life are more likely to cause trouble than solve it.I suppose a younger person, who is exceptionally psychologically stable and well-adjust and in an environment where there are many ""dateable"" people would be able to employ *some* the techniques in this book. But that is about it.Save your money."
1,"The most insulting, depressing book that I have read","""Most of the members of NOW are lesbians"", women who dress (in the eye of the beholder) suggestively are ""raping men"", ""women are obliged to modesty more than men."" If you believe these statements then this is the book for you, if however, you find these sentiments to be mean spirited, petty, sexist, and downright ludicrous and insulting then don't waste your money on this book. This is easily the most depressing relationship book that I have read. Like many Catholics and other Christians that would choose to read a book with this title, I was looking for moral support and advice to live a chaste, self-respecting life and find someone of like mind to share that life. My disappointment in this book is immense. The overall message is that men are weak and women are wicked. There is a religious group that believes this- it's called the Taliban...Fr. Morrow please join them and leave the Catholic faith to those who fairly and accurately portray it."
5,The Best Book of its Kind!,"Fr. Morrow's book is by far the best courtship guide for Catholics in print! Steve Wood's THE ABC'S OF FINDING A GOOD WIFE/HUSBAND books are good as supplements and Jason Evert's IF YOU REALLY LOVED ME is great as a primer for Teens and Chastity, but Fr. Morrow has written a book filled with deep insights and advice for faithful Catholic's looking to establish healthy and holy relationships. Fr. Morrow, who I've met mersonally, has changed my life through his work. I used to hold very pessemistic views about myself and relationships, after going through Fr. Morrow's book, I have a renewed outlook and a more real trust in God's plan for my life. This book should be required reading for young single Catholics. Parents, BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR TEENS! I cannot praisethis book enough. I think those who read this book with an open heart and mind, with grow in ways they may not have imagined."
4,"Moving youth to find new adventures, challenges beyond.","After the second world war young Gary Paulsen and his mother move to the Phillipines to find there home with their father/husband. The encounters they face while on the way to their new home are bizzar but real. Meeting new faces and new places are a drastic change as compared to life back in Chicago eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, then having to go to a new place and eat rice and sardines. Having no rules other than be a child to having to act like an adult in a far off country."
4,Another great book!!,"I am a big fan of Gary Paulsen. Some of his books like Dogsong, Hatchet,(WHICH I THINK EVERONE HAS READ) Woodsong, and Christmas Sonata. The pictuers in the book are different. He writes about living in the Philippines. One thing that he talked abouut is that there was a war going on and he callled it ""war time"". He lived in the Philippines because his dad was in the war over there. I was very glad that I read this book and I hope you will read it too."
3,Not A Favorite,"This CD by Ian is cool, but is not one of my favorite CDs, because I like faster and ""louder"" types of music. I do not recommend this CD if you like Christian rock, however you may enjoy this CD if you like slower songs with a slight hip-hop beat. The main song on this CD, ""Supersonic Dream Day"", focuses on when Jesus will come back. It also talks about how people predict that he will come on a certain day, but he will be coming like a theif in the night. This CD has cool lyrics, but is not my favorite type of music."
5,Support for personal & spiritual growth,"This book provides both perspectives and methods for ""growing whole"" in a world full of crises and challenge. I appreciate the author's perspectives on how ""work on oneself"" helps contribute to the world; so often personal work and social action are seen as separate and even conflicting. The exercises found throughout are easy to do on one's own, or with others in a group.I also recommend the accompanying audiotape/journal called ""Growing Whole: Exploring the Wilderness Within."""
3,The closest thing to a Star Trek horror story (with holes),"As a kid, I always thought this episode was one of Star Trek's scariest, with pseudo-demonic possession, malevolence galore, and the ever-present Star Trek drama. As an adult, I find the episode still scary, but you must be willing to suspend disbelief and ignore the gaping plot holes.""Lights of Zetar"" had the potential to be one of the best episodes ever, but I believe third-season budget constraints and the pressure to deliver the script on time may have damaged it's credibility. How could a hyperbaric chamber ""kill"" gaseous entities capable of warp-speed? Too many plot holes; nevertheless, this episode still gives you the willies. A Trek-lover must-have."
2,Season Three Slump Almost Over!,"Season Three suffered from a slump which lasted from Wink of An Eye to The Way to Eden (Let That Be Your Last Battlefield and The Mark of Gideon being exceptions). The Lights of Zetar showed how the low budget of Season Three hampered many episodes that had the potential to be great. The Lights of Zetar is one such episode.The episode started off with a promising teaser. Unfortunately, the episode went downhill from there. First, it would have been better if Scotty or a member of the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad had been possessed. Lt. Romaine was a likable character but the audience wouldn't care if she lived or died. Secondly, why did the Zetarians kill everyone at Memory Alpha and not on the Enterprise? It was sad seeing how the Zetarians portrayed as an evil alien that had to be destroyed. This is clearly a step down from The Devil in the Dark. The idealism of the show suffered in this Season Three slump."
2,Wh at Am I Missing?,"I am sorry, fellow Trek fans. This is one episode that I simply can't stand. Don't be mad! Maybe I have no taste! But I do find it schlocky and the music is so terribly repetetive!I have made these comments before for what they are worth but I have always loved the incidental music on Star Trek on some episodes <Journey to Babel is my favourite> but I find this episode is overkill.For fans only. Not particulalrly bad but definitely not a masterpiece."
3,Jurlique face cream,"I love, love the old version of this product. I have to say I'm very sad it was redesigned. The scent is a bit overwhelming. I have grown used to it - but I really miss the old version. I have never in my life spent this much money on a cosmetic or any kind of face cream. I discovered it when I was pregnant and my skin became really dry - this was the only thing that helped. The added bonus is that my skin glowed with this cream to such a point that I can't go a day without it. I hope the new version makes me as happy, but I'm still not sure."
2,"Overly fragranced, irritating to sensitive skin","I take some responsibility for not looking closely at the ingredient list, however nothing could have prepared me for the overwhelming perfume scent of this product. It smells a little like someone's grandmother and it's VERY strong. I also have sensitive skin, so I ended up with a terrible red and blotchy reaction on my cheeks. If you are sensitive at all to perfume in your moisturizer or several different kinds of alcohol then definitely go a different route.I may not have written this kind of review if there had, at least, been any option to return or exchange this item, but once you receive the item, allergic or not, you're stuck with it.If I helped one person be more attentive than I was when buying this product, I'll consider this bad experience a success :)"
4,Perfect cream for dry skin,"I swear by Jurlique and have been a devotee since 2000. So, last winter, when my face became very dry due to an extreme weather change, I purchased this cream and their rosewater balancing mist to help remedy the situation. Needless to say, Jurlique came to my rescue and I still use this cream as part of my evening skin regimen. However, since this cream is thick I doubt I'll be using it during the warmer months.Last thing. This cream, as some have mentioned, does have a scent but I don't find it distracting. I actually like it because it's a ""reminder"" of the cream's floral ingredients.I gave this product 4 stars because of the fact that I can't use it all year round. Otherwise, this product is 5-star worthy."
2,By far -- my least favorite in the collection,"I have the whole collection and I like it a lot, overall. But this particular volume is not recommended.The book centers Mike's character who, in my experience, is not the typical grad student. I could not identify with his plights and behaviors. He is exceptionally lazy and sleepy. I do not think a person like that could survive in real grad school, but the unfunny jokes about his experiences occupy 85% of this book. I can relate much better to themes like Cecilia's frustration with grading and her relationships with her family and enjoy the depiction of Prof. Smith's interactions with his overworked and never prepared student. However, these themes were undeveloped in this volume. Overall, I therefore found this book not funny and not insightful. Other books, particularly the 4th volume, are much more on target and resonate with what grad school experience was for me."
5,great for all grad students,this is simply hilarious and a great stress relief for grad students of any discipline.
1,Waste of money,"Can't think of any reason to keep this book. It's justnot funny. I'm going to throw it away, something I'venever done before."
1,Not funny. Stanford-centric. Not a Dilbert goes to College.,"100% of the other reviews are most likely from grad students attending Leland Stanford Jr. College. If you are not in that category of the struggling in need of ego-stroking, then you probably won't be interested. Firstly, it is not funny. After a few pages we get it: grad students are overworked, tired, poor, and mostly geeks seeking dates. How is that different than the life of undergrads? Ok, grad students have an awkward relationship with professors (who don't even know their names and use them as slaves) and under-grads (who consider them authority figures) which gives the grad students an odd mental complex. No much real humor here. Unless you count references to how supposedly great the weather is presumably in Palo Alto which is not really that good compared to southern California. If you expect actual humor, you won't find it in this. Flame on if you must, but you know this it true."
5,You really do graduate,"... but then there's a post-doc, and, well, it's pretty easy to strtetch things out.Cham's second collection has all the sparkle of the first, the great personalities, and the voice of genuine knowledge. There's an unreality, or maybe an alternate reality to grad school that comes to life as these characters work their way from the lab, to the next table full of free food, to the nervous conversations with the advisors. There's also the spouse of the PhD canditate, the long-suffering Pht (Putting him/her through).If you're in grad school, this is your life. When (if) you graduate, Scott Adams documents the cube-dweller's life quite well. Until then, Cham has you covered.-- wiredweird"
4,Cute Family Movie,"After a recent trip to the Grand Canyon, this movie was a pleasant surprise--capturing much of the beauty of the Canyon. It's a predictable tale, but nothing offensive and just a ""feel good"" movie. The scenery is worth the price, along with bonus narrative of how the movie was filmed. Recommend as light entertainment with beautiful scenery."
4,A Childhood Memory.,"I saw this as a young child and now, as a grandmother, I wanted my grandson to see it also. It is a good children's movie with memorable moral teachings."
5,Pleased.,Thank you for the very good service and product. I am enjoying having the video as we recently visited the grand Grand Canyon.
2,Probably not your best option,"I bought this book because I need a more advanced book on PHP/MySQL - specifically in the use of mysqli, PDO and stored procedures. I found this book to be quite lacking in these areas. I have the MySQL Stored Procedure Programming book by Oreilly and it covers these subjects in better detail but even it doesn't go as in-depth as I would like.I think there is some good material in this book but it didn't satisfy my immediate need and for that I am disappointed."
1,"This is not a book to learn php, its just a dictionary of functions","If you plan to learn php from this book, i suggest you start looking for another, this is just a dictionary about all terminolgy and commands regards php, but with no excercices!!! well.. there are a few lazy excercises. Its only a description of the methods i mean.. if you are reading about the function echo() you will read something like. ""ok, you should use echo in this way ""echo ""this book sucks"", echo is for show you some info on screen, or if you are reading about loops, like for.. ""ok. for is for looping! like 1 to 10"".. that's it! now you are an php expert!!!.. if there was a posibility to rate this as -5 i would."
1,Not for novice...,"This book shouldn't be advertised as ""from novice to professional"", since it start assuming that you have pretty complex knowledge of C++, HTML, etc. The book doesn't even have an ordered structure: when you are in the first chapters, it start using functions that will be explained later, just as if you should know them before.Sometimes very complex, other times it just seems like a big appendix of functions descriptions instead as a guide to use them in real program environment.After reading the whole book, and having it at sight, I tried to create a simple program and it was just impossible, because I learned useless and too complex functions but I couldn't make the simplest program without looking for help at php forums.It may be a good option for not-novice, but if you're looking for a novice book, DON'T buy this book."
2,Not for the novice!,"Despite the title, this book is not for the novice. Even the introductory first 100 pages or so assume that you are above a novice level. The examples lead to more questions (for me, the novice) than they answer.Having said that, this book has a tremendous amount of information in it and, as other reviews mention, it will work well as a reference. Now, I hope to find a true beginning PHP book to provide the basis to use this book!"
4,A really good PHP introduction book,"First off, this book is completely useless to you if you have do not have adequate OOP programming background. It jumps around different topics and does not really explain why things are arranged a certain way. This book pretty much assumes you have knowledge of either C, C#, Java techniques - which makes PHP extremely easy to understand. If HTML is all you have under your belt, this is probably a terrible book to buy.Coming from an adequate background, this book introduces plenty of useful features of PHP and offers a good guide for reference and parameters. Since the book is titled PHP and MySQL, it is expected that the reader should know basic SQL syntax to understand how PHP works with a database.Overall, this is a good starter book on a very broad topic and it has gotten me started on writing my own scripts."
2,Definitely not for begginers,"I never got around to finishing this book because halfway through it I noticed I had not even written a single line of code.The author does not propose any excercises for you to try out what your learned through the book.All he does is list all the functions available in PHP but no examples on how to use them.I can see this book being useful as a reference after you have programmed PHP for a while, but for beginners that want to get started in PHP for the very firt time I would not recommend it."
5,Finally Re-released !!,"My Reiki teacher introduced me to this album 4 - 5 years ago and I could never find it. I am so glad that someone was able to get this recording back out. The mix of flutes, koto and synthesizers is just fabulous. I'm looking forward to hearing samples from the others, but I highly recommend this album for Reiki, for Yoga or for just complementing some time alone."
1,Didn't fit,"The description made this seem too good to be true, but it never fit properly in my old computer, sadly."
5,Great deal on Chinese made battery.,"The fit and finish for this battery pack was outstanding and considering the price, a much better deal than could be found in a retail store or Apple repair shop. Was originally purchased to overcome a TOD clock battery issue with the original 2004 iBook battery pack ... sadly, this iBook has many other issues, but NOT the fault of this really nice battery pack. Thumbs up if you have a good working iBook and need a 2nd battery for trips and such."
1,Get ready to replace it!,"Didn't work with my Mac. DIDn't work at all, defective, returned for immediate fund which was handled in a timely manner."
5,Great Sound. Great lyrics. Great band.,"This album is a must for fans of Christian alternative music. The lyrics were ahead of their time and the music was a unique blend that encouraged you to answer the question ""Who do they sound like?"" with, ""They sound like The Prayer Chain""."
5,Mindfulness practicing,"At the urging of a friend, I read this book expecting only to find things of interest to musicians. Instead, I learned easily mastered techniques for centering and focus that are useful for my non-musical life. And as for my life as a lay listener, it is forever changed by my new knowledge, compliments of Ms Elson's easy prose, of the many skills beyond those at the keyboard that a musician must develop - and CAN develop - to become an accomplished performer. A fascinating read."
3,standard Jakes,"The Lawless is the 7th of the 8 books of the Kent Family Chronicles. If you have read Jakes before, you would know how standard this book is of his. All the people are either completely good, or completely evil. Love at first site is really the only type of love he writes about. Some historical people mixed in with the fictional ones; and a look at the Americas of the 1850's to 1900, mostly.The only noteworthy part of this book, is the overall uninteresting characters. None of them really come alive, and one is never in tune with any member of the family (though the book is mostly about Gideon, with a little of Matt, and less of Jeremiah). Overall a decent book, if only to have a glimpse at America just prior to the age of Unionization."
4,The Lawless,Very enjoyable - highly recommend. Historically fun to read. Mr. Jakes makes you want to keep reading and ready for more
3,"Not high art, but ripping aerial combat!","This book, like everything else written by Mr. Douglass, will never find a high place in the history of the written word. Having said that, please understand that if you are interested in reading about Naval aerial combat... you can't miss the""Carrier"" series. Even though I beliive that Mr. Douglass thinks just a bit too highly of the capabilities of the F-14 when compared to other, more modern fighters, he does tell a fine tale. My only other criticism would be that the author should abandon this story line about his father... it is getting kind of far fetched. The bottom line is that if you have a few hours to spend, they wouldn't be wasted if you read this."
3,Beware!,"I bought this, thinking this would help me with the grammar of the Estonian language. The title was somehow misleading ;) This is rather an academic work and it's not meant to serve as a ""reference grammar"" for the learners of the language at all. Most of the book is written using some weird phonetic transcription (no IPA here!). A large part of the book is devoted to phonetics by the way. The kind of phonetics that goes about ""Relationship of Sub-laryngeal Activity to Upper Channel Activity"" I didn't expect that from the title. In short: useless for Estonian language learners."
5,Hilarious,"I thought this book would be a hipster spoof on the uptight finance how-to's, but it's actually practical, especially if you're a complete degenerate. I'm buying this as an Xmas gift for all my younger cousins - it's never too young to start 'em learning how to scam free booze."
5,"""Party Like a Rock Star"" is laugh out loud funny and saves you money",This book is a quick read but I use it over and over again as a reference guide to saving money on the weekend.
3,how to something or others............,"i got this book cos i wanted to know how to do new york the cheap way. i thought id get a lot more specifics especialyy on cheap but good shopping for clothes n stuff. dont get me wrong its a good help be could have given more names and areas etc,,,"
5,Jack Kerouac's Book of Blues,"Kerouac's Book of Blues is an important book for anyone interested in Kerouac's spontaneous style of writing. For those more familiar with his novels and prose Book of Blues will open a more pure and raw form of verse than even ""On the Road"". Kerouac was truly a poet at heart. To get the full effect of this book which reaaly needs to be read aloud to full experience I also highly recommend Kerouac's Blues & Haikus CD which contains him reading several of the poems in Book of Blues."
4,AWESOME DVD,This dvd goes over some great tips for learning to surf and what you'll need for surfing and why you need certain things. It teaches you overall basic stuff for surfing. They show you some of the cool tricks to get your attention so it's not all about learning and that's it. I loved the videa a good handy tool for your first paddle out. Get stoked and get get wet.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Don't waste your time or money on this lousy 35 minute movie of a couple of girls surfing. Other than how to 'Duck Dive' with a long, or shortboard, you won't learn anything else. There are websites with free info on surfing that will teach you how to choose a board, get past the breaks, when to go for a wave, how to stand up, turn, drop, etc. Just go into search engine http://www.dogpile.com and type in 'learn to surf'. I am very much a novice and thought this DVD was instructional...well it ain't. If you really just want to waste your hard earned moola, send your money to me instead."
4,A wonderful cookbook!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this cookbook and cannot wait to try many of the recipes. It has a lot of history before each section as well as descriptions before many of the recipes to tell where the recipe came from and how it fits into Irish tradition. It had the overall effect of making me feel as if I'd traveled to Ireland and visited the kitchens of chefs and housewives alike.The only disappointment was that at least one of the recipes I would like to try is written with antiquated measurements (ie. use two stones of flour).Still, I would highly recommend it to anyone."
2,"Good Effort, Overpriced!","While having some good material for anyone considering entry into the Family Day Care business, there is very little information provided which cannot be found in books selling for half the price. The only things I found in this book which was not in three others I have read on the subject were the copies of government forms which might be used by practitioneers once they have opened their home day care business. This does not add the enough value to the book to justify the price."
2,It's a very pretty book.,"Nice color photos with pretty witches. Gorgeous drawn illustrations. Glossy paper.Nice ideas for rituals.However, you really need to take Ms. Morningstar's generalisations and pseudohistory with a grain of salt. I don't belive this is a good book for a beginning seeker."
5,Really wokrs,This product has been out for many years and it is still the best facial cream on the market. Out performs many brands that are 3 x more expensive.
4,Nurtura is great!,"This is a wonderful beautifying cream. I use it to blend my makeup and on my skin to soften dry skin. I get compliments when I wear it. I am not sure if it stops wrinkles, but I know it makes my makeup application go on so much better and leaves a glow to my skin. I hope Avon never stops making it."
4,Good phone,"I like the n75. It has a nice screen, good features, and some cool apps. you can run on it.However, it's not too good for mobile games. The directional button is too close to the music button and it quits out of the game if you press it. Also s60 v3 wont run old n-gage games like I thought it would.The camera is not too good for stills. There is very long delay after you hear the shutter and when the picture is taken. Making action shots impossible and ""posed for"" pictures always seem to be after the subject smiles. Video, on the other hand, is pretty impressive.Battery life is not the best on this phone either. But not as bad as reviews lead me to beleive.Music player functions are good. Nokia port instead of standard jack really sucks though. It is a pain to plug things into that thing. Nokia is behind the times in this area.Overall I would recommend the n75 to anyone that wants a s60 v3 phone with music capabilities and doesn't mind the nokia port."
5,Elsie was my grandmother,"I love this cookbook, of course I am partial as she was my grandmother. The best recipe is the blueberry cobbler!!!"
2,Predictable and extra light.,"Erin's story is ultra light, too light if you ask me.Girl gets knocked up by awful boyfriend - meets gorgeous looking and ""widowed"" boss - they hit it off wonderfully and he proposes after many hot steamy nights of sex (don't forget morning sex and nooners).This is the kind of book that doesn't surprise and doesn't entice insight. It's flat, simple, uncomplicated, and might make some women entertain the idea of taking off to the Caribbean with their boss if the chance comes up.Sexual and young."
3,"Made the Grade: NY Girlfriends Series, Book 1","3.5 out of 5 stars. A sweet, hot, and funny story where you root for the two main characters from the beginning!! Mandy is a great character .... her plot about being pregnant (and everything that goes along with that) is really well written and thought out. Where Damien's past is revealed in a way where you want good things for him and it makes you wish you could help him out too. The chemistry between these two just sparks off of the pages!The only reason this novel didn't get a better/higher rating was because of how Mandy's roommates try to get involved and meddle things up .... it was very annoying and unnecessary for the plot.Reviewed By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
3,Fun read,"This was a fun, quick light read that I enjoyed. There aren't any drawn out relationship dramas, the characters are likable and it's good dialogue. The premise might be unrealistic in real life but who cares.I recommend for a weekend or vacation read."
3,"Lightehearted, Cheerful","This was a pretty lighthearted, cheerful little romp. There was no enemy, not much angst...not really ANY angst. It was a pretty mindless read, so it's good when you're in the mood for a nice little story that's not too involved and doesn't involve utilizing any part of your brain except the reading part. The best part of the book was that the heroine is British and that Ms. McCarthy makes every effort to utilize the British pronunciations when Mandy is speaking."
4,A Pretty Good Read,It's a pretty good read.A little bit erotic. Some parts I'll admist made me blush lol but they were very well writtin.Great for a summer read.
2,"Oh, no!","The subtitle for this book should have been: How to Ruin a Perfect Premiss for a book.When I read the synopsis for this book I thought 'Wow! A pregnant girl loses her bf but her boss falls in love with her! What could go wrong?'Everything.I skipped pages, forced myself to read it (which is very rare) and with a feeling of defeat, I confess: I put the book down and never finished it (and never will).The storyline is corny, brainless and insulting. The main character, Mandy is a complete loser who doesn't inspire any compassion.Don't even get me started on Damien, her love interest! If he was a real guy, he would be the type of nutcase who stands outside your apartment, in the rain, rocking back and forth, grinning at you while singing a scary little tune.Wanna read chick-lit? Get another book."
2,Pretty weak and predictable,"I really thought I was going to like this book as I am easy to please when it comes to chic lit novels. This was pretty bad and it had like 4 or 5 sex scenes that literally went on for a whole chapter for each of them. Its like the author couldn't think of a plot or good dialogue and just decided to fill the pages with rauchy sex scenes. I like romance and all but this was overkill - I found myself skipping pages by the third one. It was weak, totally unrealistic and predictable."
3,"Easy read, but not memorable","This was a cute heartwarming story. Easy to read... Perfect for some down time. This is the second time I have read this story... I read it two years ago, did not remember so that's why i am giving it 3 stars. It easy read, but not memorable."
2,Hard to like.,"The plot was fun, but I didn't like the characters. Mostly the hero in the book. I just thought he was a little bit of a sissy so I couldn't really get into the book. It wasn't one of Erin's better books. At least to me. The plot was fun. The guy wasn't."
2,Pretty Crude,"I started this book really into it, thinking it would be a great read. And it was, up until the Caribbean trip. The sex scenes were so overly graphic, you'd think a teenage boy had written them. And the characters just got dumb after that. It was really hard for me to finish, and I agree with some of the other reviewers who saw the ending from a mile away. Initially I was going to try some of the author's other books, but this one was unnecessarily raunchy in my opinion."
1,"poor character development, lots of explicit sex","I didn't know enough about any of these people to care if they lived happily ever after or not, but I'm sure they will, despite all the poorly resolved problems they have, because after all, the sex was amazing. A much better read with the same basic plot line is Morning Glory by LaVyrle Spencer."
1,Awful,"This book was horrible. Jus plain porn with no plotline nor argument at all. It has gone straight to the dustbin, and I could not wait to finish it to do just that (I tend to give the books a chance up to the last page in case they improve and have something to tell, this was not the case). This is not a love story or a comedy, it feels fake, and the characters have no depth. Don't buy it."
2,Started off good...,"I'm about half-way done with this book and I can't say I am excited to finish it.It started off great, I was interested in what was going on. It was funny and quirky.But after Mandie and Damien take off for Punta Cana, their vacation becomes a never-ending lovefest. If I wanted to read something so raunchy, I'd pick up a dirty novel. But the worse part is, the sex DOES NOT END. What started as hot-n-heavy has become redundant and completely over-the-top. We get it - they're great in bed!!!I bet I can predict what will happen: both are saying that the relationship ""cannot go any further than sex."" They get back home and their secret affair continues. They cannot stop thinking about eachother. She has the baby, he proposes and wants to be the baby's father and they live happily ever after. L-A-M-E."
2,"Anecdotal, rather than concrete","A nice enough book, as a book to read before you read a practical book about renovating your home. The anecdotes are interesting to read, but I came away from the book with little to go on for my own upcoming renovation. This is not a book I highlighted, or where I turned corners down. A much better book, with practical help in the renovation process, is ""What the Experts May Not Tell You about Building or Renovating Your Home"". Similar titles, but while ""What No One Ever Tells You"" is full of anecdotes, ""What the Experts May Not Tell You"" is full of concrete and practical, step by step processes for handling renovation as an owner, including insights into relationships between the parties (owner, contractor, architect, inspectors, lenders, etc.)."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"If your looking for practical advise on renovating, this isn't it. It's full of antedotal stories of renovations gone wrong and right, but isn't a guide to renovating...more like a book of short stories. By the end of it you'll know more about the writer and his family and friends than you will about renovating. A waste of time."
2,Remodeling sound like a pleasure cruise? Read this book!,"Honestly answer this question for yourself... Do you think your upcoming remodeling project is going to be executed according to the carefully laid plan that you've spent eons putting together?If so, then I would recommend this book, it will help ease you into some of the realities of home remodeling. You will get the opportunity to read about people who planned, and budgeted, and then found that much of their work was for naught for a variety of reasons that you probably haven't thought about. But that doesn't mean it can't be fun, just be aware.If, on the other hand, you realize that no matter how carefully you plan, the plan will be changed, and that no matter how much you make sure to budget for, the budget will be broken, then I would give this book a pass, unless you just want a good chuckle."
2,Good stories but no help if you're remodeling,"This book has some interesting stories, but there wasn't a lot of practical advice. Also, it isn't really pertinent unless you live on the East coast. We live in California and a remodel here is very different than what was covered in the book."
1,The pelican Quake pak Plus 256k Memory in blue.,"I am very sad that I was cheated out of getting the real thing,I ordered the Pelican Quake Pak Plus 256k Memory in Blue,but I got a generic Rocker pak instead. Watch out, you don't always get what you wish for. Buy from Amarzon only! not from the marketplace people."
3,I'm mixed on this book,I think Jim did a great job explaining tactics and habits but I would have like to have seen more detailed maps and charts on when the fish were running and where.
3,Uriah Heep - 'Sea Of Light' (Spitfire),"Not a bad effort by this long running British heavy rock unit, but I definitely liked their newest offering 'Wake The Sleeper' ('08) a bit better. Tracks here that should satisfy most old school Heep followers are ""Against The Odds"", the heavy hitting ""Fear Of Falling"", ""Spirit Of Freedom"", ""Words In A Distance"" and ""Dream On"". Vocalist / front man Bernie Shaw doesn't hurt Uriah Heep's longevity - as a few have mentioned before that Shaw has obviously been somewhat influenced by the likes of Steve Perry and the late Boston crooner Bard Delp. I sort of tend to agree with that. Personally, I thought that 'Sea Of Light' was a bit too commercial but maybe that's just me. Give it a listen."
3,Just okay,"I LOVE the cake mix doctor cookbooks. However, I was disappointed in the Dinner Doctor cookbook. The recipes weren't for meals that a busy family would eat."
3,Disappointed,I was a little disappointed with this book. Her other books were so great but this one did not knock my socks off and it did not inspire me like her other books did.
2,Glad I got the book second-hand...,"I found this book at a garage sale for fifty cents. It's going back in my garage sale pile. I read the other less favorable reviews and I agree that there are odd mixes of ingredients that sound fun, but miss the mark when executed. If you are looking for a ""open a can/box and put a good meal on the table"" book, may I suggest ""The Can Opener Gourmet"" by Laura Karr."
5,Great Cookbook!,Full of easy recipes using products that are usually already in my pantry. I think it would be a wonderful cookbook for beginners.
2,Save your money to buy her cake books,I LOVE her cake mix dr books but hate this one. Every recipe I have tried has been awful. I don't cook with many prepared/boxed foods so maybe it is not a fair judgement. I love the idea of the book for when things are crazy and you want to make something fast and easy but the flavor of the dishes are really bad.
2,Disappointment.,"Majority of recipes are gourmet-type recipes with ingredients my family would never touch. I was surprised, because I really liked her Cake Mix Doctor Book."
4,"Save time, but get great results","I particularly like the salads in this book--they are fast and taste great! With all of the pre-washed salad-in-a-bag available now, these recipes make preparation a snap. I like the variety, and of course, the easy and quick preparation. She has included a nice palette of flavors to help get me out of my salad rut! I do, however, wish there were pictures to provide serving ideas. The way food looks is important to me."
2,Not Very Useful,"I cook constantly for my family; I find this book not very helpful. It is supposed to be tailor-made for someone like me, I suppose, who could use some easy, quick recipes for those uninspired evenings when dinner looms. But I find that these recipes call for ingredients I would not have on hand, and the shortcuts are off-putting. You need so much grocery-store-prepared food to pull these recipes off, it seems. I'd rather cook simply from a few scratch ingredients. Besides quality control issues, grocery-store-made foods are expensive. And usually pretty bad health-wise (salty & sugary.)I was given this book as a gift and I have enjoyed reading it, but I find it wordy and overwhelming. I don't find it practical, or very enticing. I made the angel hair pasta with roasted red pepper sauce (p. 272) and it sorely needed salt, more moisture (I used chicken stock) and Parmesan cheese to bring it to life.I'm sorry, but I think this book will be in my next give-away pile."
2,A disappointment,I thought the Cake Mix Doctor by this author was just great. How could this book be such a dud? I was very disappointed.
2,This book will make you reach for the takeout menus,"I like the dessert-related Doctor books, but this book did not appeal to me at all. In fairness, I cannot say if the recipes were good or bad because I didn't actually cook anything in this book... none of the recipes appealed to me enough to do so. Most looked boring or unappetizing... is a recipe for pork fried rice really necessary? Poppy Seed Chicken Casserole sounds yucky. Despite the book's substantial size, there are not that many entree ideas which is what I was looking for. There is a chapter devoted to pastas, but other books such as While the Pasta Cooks have much more appetizing recipes that can be prepared quickly from fresh ingredients. A big section of the book is devoted to desserts, which is territory already covered by Byrn's other Doctor tomes.People with busy lifestyles would be much better off using quick and healthy recipes from Cooking Light or some other publication. Byrn should stick with desserts."
5,Memories,I loved it as a kid and this video brought back a lot of great Christmas memories. Now I can wach it every year at Christmas and remember the good ole days.
3,Santa and the Three Bears,"This was a favorite audio story and book for our son when he was a toddler. When I saw it was available on DVD I wanted to order it for him to share with his three little ones. The audio required imagination and the video was just okay quality (copied from VHS?), but wasn't quite the way I envisioned the story - since everyone has their own imagination. Cute for young children who are not as particular about sound and picture quality."
3,Santa and the Three Bears,"This version of the classic movie deletes the introduction and conclusion ""live action"" footage from the original Santa & The Three Bears. It's a great kids Christmas story, but leaves out the touching early seens with ""Mr. Ranger"" and his grandkids."
5,Santa & the Three Bears,"This is my absolute favorite Christmas program. Until I found it on Amazon, I had spent many years searching for it since it rarely airs on television. Thanks to Amazon, it's once again a part of my holiday tradition."
5,Mr. Ranger and the 3 Bears Christmas,"A very old Christmas cartoon. This was sent, as a surprise, to my adult daughter. Needless to say - she called when she received it - excited and elated.The best part of the cartoon is when the voice-over asks ""Do you belive in Santa Claus?"" Sit the kids on the floor in front of you and watch the nods of the heads. Worth the price of admission.Great cartoon for todays kids -- makes even the grown up kids little ones again.A must have."
3,Disappointed in sound,"I was excited to find this, as it had been a favorite of our's. Since it is no longer shown on TV, I thought I would make the small investment. However we were very disappointed in the sound quality."
4,Santa and the Three Bears - Image Ent DVD,"I just picked up the Image Entertainment release of Santa and the Three Bears, while not perfect, it is the best transfer out there, and also includes the live action bookends. If you are a fan, this is the version to pick up. 10/30/2012 release."
1,Beware! Horrible DVDR (copy) missing scenes and poor quality.,"I don't know how they are getting away with this, but it's not a real DVD. It's a cheesy copy in a poorly made case and laughable art. The thing skips and when you finally get it working, you notice the entire section with the real Ranger is missing and the end is cut short, with sections just gone. The release is inexcusable. It's a film in public domain, so that means anyone can release it I guess. But this is just obnoxious and an insult."
2,look for restored copy,"I bought this DVD for my 2 girls (age 6). This was one holiday story that I enjoyed and wanted to share it with them. The story is great, 2 bears want to know about christmas and the park ranger tells them about it, but the quality was very poor. I had the stereo turned all the way up to hear the sound which was laced with a low hum throughout and the actual movie quality is very poor also. It appears that this old show was copied from a VCR and put on a DVD and then mass marketed. I recommend the story but not this version, look for one that has been restored."
2,Terrible Quality,"The sound quality is awful - it's full of pops, like an old 78 record. The picture quality is so old, that it's rather hard to watch. It seems quite primative. After reading the other reviews & recommendations, I was really looking forward to seeing and owning this old classic. The story is very sweet, but I was really disappointed in the quality."
1,More effective than a sedative!,If your lacking sleep buy this movie!! I bought it thinking it was supposed to be funny. It is actually a documentary about mullets. Thats it!!! NO ATTEMPTS at levity AT ALL!!! Literally! I thought it would be along the lines of all the websites out there that poke fun at this sad state of hair. BUT ITS NOT!!!! It was dry and long and had no point!!!!!! RUN AWAY!!!!!!
2,No real effect for my engine.,"I don't regret purchasing the filter, since it is cleanable. With the age of my car I have to mail order filters so reuseability is a plus. I didn't notice ANY performance change. I am running a turbocharged engine and figured the K&N filer would do something. Nope."
5,What a show.,"What a show indeed. An awesome collection of Carvey at his best. Is there a better impressionist in world? I don't think so. He's brilliant as Perot, Bush, and Johnny Carson as well as some of his own created characters. A must SNL fans and a definite for any Carvey fan. Side splitting laughter that is as good as anything Eddie Murphy did and better than Chris Farley's (although I loved his also) stuff. Buy this!"
2,"""Not that Great""",Many of the skits just dragged on for much too long. I wish I had read these reviews BEFORE I purchased it.....Disappointed
2,"Now made in China, and not made well","I decided to buy this toaster after seeing a review stating that it's an excellent, made-in-the-USA product. When it arrived, my wife immediately pointed out the made-in-China logo. Well, the new manufacturing plant doesn't appear to be able to build this product right. When we first started using it, it seemed like the five darkness settings were: 1-warm, 2-toast, 3-burn, 4-carbonize, and 5-self-clean. But within a few weeks it started to toast less and less, so we had to turn the knob higher. But then it started to produce more-or-less random results. The other problem is that the darkness fades from left-to-right across the bread; it seems the heating element is stronger near the controls than at the far side. The only plus to this toaster is that it lifts the toast up high so that it's easy to remove; otherwise this would be a one-star product."
1,False Advertising Alert !!!!! This is NOT made in USA ...... :-(,"After searching the internet for a Made in America toaster,I thought the West Bend brand was it.I was WRONG!None of the West Bend small appliancesare Made In America. They , like many corporationshave shifted production to a factory in China leavinghundreds if not thousands of Americans out of work.Currently the government states that unemploymentis ONLY 9.6 %,BUT do you believe it ? Look at clothing labels, read the boxesof every product you buy and guess what! Chances are it wasn't made here.I will be returning this cheaply made toaster today andlook to other manufacturers like Haier and Sharp USA."
1,A Lemon,"I bought this great looking toaster back in June of 2006. I first noticed that it toasted darker on one side (when not on the bagel setting), but I was willing to overlook that ""problem"". After just a few months of use, the lever pops up after a few seconds and I have to push it back down 2 or 3 more times in order for it to toast my bread. Back to West Bend it goes!"
2,Not up to par,"We are very disappointed in the peformance of this toaster. The bread will toast good on the inside but barley on the outside. I sent email to West Bend and was told the maybe the bagle switch was stuck--no help. If I return it, shipping cost makes it not worth it. Good appearance and Company name fooled me. FYI"
3,West Bend toaster,Thought I was buying America Made. Disappointed to find this made in China. It is hard to adjust this toaster to get one slice toasted. Have to turn temperature from one number to another for one slice or two. Didn't send back as only paid around fourteen dollars with discount. Won't buy another
3,Overpriced but performs better than some brands,"This toaster, minus the bagel button, is sold in the U.K. as the unbadged house brand for ASDA (who are Wal-Mart). In the U.K. it is a budget brand and sells for under 20 (about $32). As a cheap toaster is works OK and better than some more expensive models.You get what you pay for so don't expect too much. We had our last one, made by the same Chinese factory, for 8 years. Some U.K. toasters won't accept or toast a bagel, this one does. We would buy the same again but it is overpriced at $45.95."
3,a disapointment,"While adequate, this toaster is not as good as the one it replaced. It's difficult to get consistent toasting (first slices are too light, additional slices are too dark)."
4,West Bend 2 Slice Toaster,This toaster is very good for the price. It toasts very fast and it looks sleek. It also toasts bagels nicely.
5,Worth reading over again,I have two small daughters. This book will come in handy for years to come! It deals with divorce and remarriage (which I am going through) as well as how your daughter is feeling at different ages. I suggest this book to parents with daughters of all ages. It is insightful and well written. It will become a permanent part of my library for future reference.
3,Blue is beautiful,"This is a great video. It really follows up to it's name. ""Blue Is Beautiful"", is beautiful. I liked it a lot. Buy it."
2,They changed it...,"I've been buying Zone Perfect Fudge Graham bars for years. They were a little bigger and more chewy than these new ones but they tasted great. However, the new ones I purchased (March 2007) are horrible. Like others have said they taste artificial. I think the chocolate they use has changed and is now too sweet.I guess Abbott Labs (who bought Zone Perfect in July 2003) wasn't making enough money on the original formula."
4,Family,"What happens when you catch your husband in bed with a 20 something bimbo?That's right, you take a break from life. But did you expect to fall in love with a woman. Did you expect your immediate family and friends to push you back with your husband.The woman of your dreams...is just that!"
4,"For the Fans, but nothing new.","If you are a Lizzie fan, this will be an enjoyable calendar. I love Lizzie. I love the calendar. So much more could have been done with this calendar. It has some cute sayings and some fun photos, but its really nothing new or special."
5,Lovely,"I ordered four of these for my kitchen cabinets and they look even lovelier ""in person"". One note - the two screws (included) go into these two little ""nubs"" on the back so the handle sticks out away from the cabinet door about 1/3"". I wanted the leaves to lay flat, so I drilled a wider hole for the nubs to sink in (in addition to the regular skinnier hole for the screw), and that worked beautifully with one caveat: I had to buy shorter screws because the ""sunken"" nubs were now closer to the screw ends. They look really lovely installed this way."
4,Another strong album.,"Different from the rest of SOD's albums in that it contains a fiddle. This was supposed to be a big comeback album, but the deal with the record company fell through. The tracks here are great. Into the Rising Sun, In the City, and of course Paradise; these are among the band's best. The guitar work on Law is a bit Guns and Roses like compared to the band's other work. The sax is barely noticeable, but good songwriting makes up for it. The one point where the album falters a bit is that songs like Chemical Head, Burnout, Killing Ground, and Krystalize are kind of lacking in the refrain department, normally a strong suite for Kirk. The songs are still impressive for the most part, with great melodies like on When the Bull Comes Down, and good lyrics like on Killing Ground."
4,"""...Your Red Scarf Matches Your Eyes...""","""Your Red Scarf Matches Your Eyes, You Close Your Cover Before Striking, and Loving You Has Made Me Bananas...."" For the graphic artist or just fans of the visually arresting, there are some supurb images in this publication. Chronicle Books put out a book two or three years later called MATCHBOOK ART by Yosh Kashiwabara which is a nice compliment to this Abbeville Book. The Steel/Heimann book was published at a time when Abbeville was putting out a fun, funky series on American Pop culture - John Margolies MINATURE GOLF book, and the Dyer/Spark book FIT TO BE TIED: VINTAGE TIES OF THE FORTIES & EARLY FIFTIES, all of which are useful references for those in the (or into) arts/applied arts field/popular culture/or mid-century americana. The breakdown of categories in CLOSE COVER BEFORE STRIKING works well, the text (which is sparse) is very readable, and the page layout is attractive. I'd say that it would be a fine addtion to any bookshelf."
1,Long Time Us3 Fan,"I have been a fan of Us3 since Hand on the Torch came out, and I have to say this cd is an utter dissappointment. The remixes are barely any different than the originals, they sound like they just removed some parts and replaced them with crap. They are generically mixed by generic ears. READ -Nellee Hooper sucks- The best of the worse is ""thinking about your body"" remix. It at least sounds different than the original. You want something cool from Us3? Get the Korean bonus disc that has the original songs from Hand on the Torch. THAT will make you tap your feet."
3,Not Sure,Like others I cannot review due to slow delivery. I think it is important for any picking this to be patient and not expect quick start of subscrip.
2,Morohome,"I am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\Sure it would be good if I was ever to get one?Dave TumanNew Bern , NC"
4,Not bad,"I wished there were only uplifting songs and no heartbreak songs in this collection, but there's lots of good stuff here."
5,A new and rewarding direction for a gifted artist,"I have followed Brent's career since I first noticed he was singing backing vocals and playing keyboards with Todd Rungren. Over the years I have seen his name pop up on various albums and always loved his musicianship. Brent gained some brief pop success with the duo recording ""Bourgeois Tagg"" (with Larry Tagg) and that's when I really fell in love with his writing. His next two solo releases were equally rich with great songs and vocals, but the new recording is a breath of fresh air. What an enjoyable listening experience, no matter if you are a Christian music listener or not. There IS still some creativity out there in the music world and Brent is one of the very best."
5,Great adoption gift!!,My children have received several copies of this great book! I finally convinced them to sell one. They love seeing things that came from their native land.
2,Tripping over themselves,"This is an interesting debut CD. The beat is usually simplistic on early albums, but these guys seem to accelerate into the changes. 'Tripping' instead of trippy. Which is good. That said, the production on the vocals is off. Fuzzy, in an irritating way. Songs like Change of Mind, Blown Away and Brown-Eyed Pickle Boy are better because they allowed the vocals to occasionally break through. Miles and Miles of Pain is best because they slowed down and boosted the vocals. I'm harsh on this CD (2 stars) because I rate based on how often I figure to listen to it, and in this case, not often. I'm really hoping their final work, Tripping Daisy, is re-released or comes down in price because I like what I've heard from it. So the band (or its choice in producers) definitely improved."
3,Teetering on the brink of -4-,"This is my least favorite Tripping Daisy album, but that's like saying you have a least favorite James Brown CD: they're all good. In the wake of Nirvana record labels scrambled to sign the ""next big rock band."" Island got that on this album. My Umbrella all the way to The Morning are superb, and Blown Away is excellent too. Brown Eyed Pickle Boy and Miles and Miles of Pain are the weakest songs, but they lay the blueprint for future Daisy albums, the ones where Wes and Tim and the rest of the boys gelled to creat the perfection heard on Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb and the brand new Tripping Daisy.I agree that one should start here and subsequently buy the rest so you can prgress with the band and better understand how the later albums fit into their canon."
5,Battery powers my camera properly,My original battery lasted 5 years. I expect this one to do the same. Though not promoted this battery also fits the SD300
4,Great purchase!,Purchasing a replacement battery has definitely extended the life of my camera. Most of my pics come out great except for a few at night...I am wondering if my camera is just getting old and would not consider this dependent upon the battery. I highly recommend this product!!
5,Keeps on Runnin',What a great value. You can never have too many batteries when you're out taking pictures & videos. I'm still using this thing 3 years later & it still charges quick & lasts pretty much the same amount of time it did when I received it.
1,Refurbished Battery failed in 4 months,The refurbished Canon battery failed in less than four months. There should be some disclaimers or warning statments before such products are sold at Amazon. I would not recommend them to anyone.
5,Great extra battery,I purchased this battery as a spare for my Canon SD780IS and it is as good as the original. Battery life is amazing and I was able to take around 300 pictures with a single charge.
1,this battery sucks,I wanted a reliable replacement battery for my camera so I bought the full Canon proprietary (expensive) battery on Amazon. I broke it in correctly and it charged up well at first. Then I went on a trip of a lifetime that I cannot duplicate. Within two months of my purchase this battery completely failed. It would not hold a charge for an hour. I was not able to take pictures for two weeks because I was on a raft trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. I checked the return policy. For electronics you get 30 days. Compared to the third-party battery I bought earlier (and much cheaper) this battery is not even close. Needless to say I will NEVER buy electronics from Amazon again.
3,Canon NB-4L Battery - Not as Advertised,"Battery is advertised as a ""brand name"", i.e., Cannon NB-4L Battery Pack. The product received is not labeled by any manufacturer and specifically states ""Replacement for NB-4L. I suggest that this is misleading advertising if this is not the original product as specified.To date the product has performed to my satisfaction. I was simply disappointed with the integrity of the transaction."
5,"unbeatable price, no shipping to APO","Even with shipping, I saved at least 50% compared to Best Buy. I was very pleased with the price, however I had to mail the items to a friend in the U.S. who had to mail it to me in Iraq."
5,As described! OEM Canon Battery,"The title pretty much explains it all. The battery is original Canon and performs actually much better than the original (when new). I am using this with a Canon SD300.In terms of shipping, the seller was also quick to process and ship the order. Would definitely purchase again."
4,Good Battery,"This battery lasts longer than regular AAA batteries. I take approximately 10 pictures per week and only seem to need to recharge the battery every 2 to 3 months. I have two of these batteries so that I always have power to my camera. I would never go back to regular AAA batteries after using this battery. I have been pretty happy with the life of the battery, but I wish it was smaller or required a smaller charger."
5,Great Extra Battery,"I bought this as an extra battery for my Canon camera. I went with the Canon brand rather than a no-name brand because of the other reviews I read, and I'm glad I did. The price was excellent compared to what i would have paid at Best Buy and it works fine."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I am NOT an Amazon competitor. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! I'm beginning to believe the following statement in quotations from Electro Bargains is just a cover up to make themselves look innocent- here's their statement:""Beware this feedback is left by a competitive seller on amazon to win competition by ruining our feedback."" The truth is, I ordered a battery from them that did not work (Battery did not look like my camera's original Canon battery. Print was much lighter. Connection holes on sides were smaller than original battery and did not make contact with Camera - is this a Canon imitation?), I was instructed to send it back and was promised a refund. I never did get a refund and they never answered my emails after they promised me the refund. Safer to buy your battery at a Radio Shack where you can be treated better and return/exchange your battery if it does not work."
2,Brand Misrepresented,"I was seeking a genuine CANON NB-4L battery for digital camera. Item for sale was advertised as ""Canon NB-4L Battery Pack for the SD40, SD630, SD600, SD750, SD1000 & TX1 Digital Cameras"" Product received was different brand: ""Digipower@RTM Replacement for: Canon NB-4L, Item #BP-CN4L.""I am disappointed in product but did not want to hassel with return mail."
1,This product is very BAD,I spent more money on this CANON battery because I thought it had a better quality than other brands which are compatible with my canon camera. But this battery can ONLY work for taking at most 10 pictures or 5 min video. SO there must be quality problem in the product. Moreover the appearance of this so called Canon Battery is very different with that of my original one including the words on the back side ( of course the side with CANON is similar). I will return it and never touch the product from this supplier.
4,Good value,"After checking with major retailers, this was the best price for the same identical battery."
4,It is pretty good,It is light but it exhusted a little bit faster than the battery i used to be used
2,Crazy circuit inside,"After mounting it into a charger in 10 minutes, the status LED on the charger changes to green. The charger means that the battery is charged fully. I have to let keep charging to get the real full charge. Sometimes, the camera also warns low battery and shuts down automatically. I must turn it on again and can use normally.THE BATTERIES COME FROM AMAZON IS SO CRAZY. (I bought two batteries from amazon)"
3,over priced,$40 for a battery is ridiculous. Is there really a big difference between these and the generic Canon-compatible batteries that sell for $10? Canon-cameras are so power hungry that you really need to carry a spare battery with you most of the time.
1,never received,"I am unable to review this product, as I never received it, and when I requested it to be resent, was only told I would receive a refund."
3,Not real?,"I ordered this battery for my sd960 from one of the Seller's but Amazon fulfills their orders. It is not exactly like the battery that came with my camera...this one is like a lil bigger, but it fits and works in my camera. The writing on the battery is thicker/bolder and fainter than the real battery. So I question if it's genuine because it came in really bad packaging, you can take it out, and put it back in the packaging and no one would know. Also, it's not like the sturdy packaging you get in stores. it's just really flimsy ([...]. I paid around 20$ so..i dont know how i feel about this."
2,Case popped after 10 months of light use,"Battery casing popped open after 10 months of light (mostly weekend night, followed by charging) use. That's not a good sign for a lithium ion battery, but I'd rather stick with the Canon brand than go with some generic that might actually explode instead of just popping. The popped battery still works perfectly, I just don't feel safe using it."
5,Having a spare battery is a must.,Can't say enough about bringing a spare battery when you're on an extended vacation.
5,not just impressed by the price,I was seeking fast service and the real deal! I got everything I wanted and more. I found this item online; I got the authentic item shipped immediately and my camera works again! Thanks to the vendor and thanks to Amazon!
2,"Price is good, quality is not.","I double checked if it is exactly same as the original battery that came with my camera before purchasing. It is exactly the same so i bought it, for the price was less than half as listed on Canon website. This should have been my clue, for the battery does not work the same. It takes a long time between shots which I don't experience with the original battery. WATCH OUT, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! This must not be made by Canon."
5,AWSOME,Great price great product why pay top retail get a great price I have 3 now!!!! They are very good quality and last a long time...
4,The Perfect Replacement,"This battery replaced the original battery, that came with my camera after it stop holding a charge, it has been a perfect replacement , it works great ."
4,"Having a spare is a necessity, even at this price","Amazon has the best price for this battery, even though I cringed when buying because it seems so overpriced. I wanted to go with a genuine battery after some bad experiences with off brands, and I think it has been worth the extra money. 4 stars only because of the price."
4,"Great battery, a bit pricey","This is a great battery, descent battery life, and charges quickly. It is a little pricey but since it goes with several models of the Cannon camera family, it helps with the cost of not having to buy diffeent batteries if upgrading. I have the SD400, very very early model and plan to upgrade to the SD750 and very glad to know that I will be able to keep the same battery and charger."
3,too many strings!,Frank's voice is dwarfed by the ever-present string sound. I much prefer Frank with more of a big band accompanying him.
1,Not helping...,"(Note: I posted this review a couple years ago and it somehow got moved to the ""book"" section under this same title...)The most relentlessly nihilistic, intentionally disturbing wannabe art-house vomit ever made. So totally devoid of humanity it should be erased from history. The impression is that the film was intentionally made to worsen the viewer's life to somehow even the playing field of all human existence out of some sort of morally relativistic sense of justice. It doesn't. Whether the film-maker had this intention or not makes no difference. The end result is inhumane garbage. The act of creating suffering or pain for another person doesn't guarantee any kind of revelation on the part of the one enduring the pain. I understand the value of shock. I understand our need for art to wake people up. I agree that our world is often relentlessly harsh. But no matter how noble the intentions, this film makes things worse. Garbage on garbage."
2,"If you liked ""Boogie Nights,"" you might like this.","Hey, why not make a flick where amateur porn is a theme? I loved the hot male nudity here. Foreign male actors must be much more comfortable with that than their American counterparts. The director character has a very sexy, hairy chest. This film is arthouse in that it's non-linear with fast-forwarding and tangentially related images popping up everywhere. I never read Sartre's ""No Exit"" but in the way that the three main characters seem trapped in a space, I wonder if that book was the influence. This movie also moved slowly compared to Hollywood fare. If you like experimental, indie, foreign, somewhat highbrow stuff, you might like this."
4,A Valuable book!!!,I offered this book to my uncle who recently wrote a Ph.D thesis on Tonny Morrison and I did find valuable materials to build up the core of his work. This is the book to read for all the people want to specialize in the study of this famous African American author.
4,A good overview of the weirdness extant throughout history,This book presents a lot of fascinating lives through some great black-and-white comic art. The only downside to this book would be that the stories don't get as detailed as I would have liked.Pick it up if you want to get an idea of how being different can fuel creativity.
4,"What is ""weird""?","This book explains in a fun, great to read, way how weirdness has affected human history. From the depravity of Caligula, Hitler, and Amin, to the world changing visions of Edison, Poe, and Duncan. The foreword by Gahan Wilson puts weirdnes in it's perpsective, and tells how this book can be useful."
5,A good coverage of RUP plus useful extensions,"The book provides a very readable coverage of IBM's Rational Unified Process, as well as useful extensions that address important aspects of enterprise systems planning, development, and management. The systematic and disciplined treatment is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of much useful, pragmatic advice that draws from the practical experience of the authors in building real systems.I quite liked this book. Although it doesn't give enough emphasis to conceptual data analysis (something RUP has always been weak on), it has loads of useful, practical content that make it a worthwhile addition to the literature."
3,So disappointed. The book has no exampels,"I bought this book because of its high rating among RMI developers. I was disappointed, becuase the book doesn't contain a single comprehensive example. I found it hard to learn without example."
3,My least favorite book on RMI. Can you be too concise?,"I have several books on RMI and looking for more. This is one in my collection and my least favorite. It is too reference-like, which you can find enough of on the developer's networks. Most notably it lacks continuity; it is basically a huge outline where each paragraph is the most concise definition for that topic. It makes a great reference for the experienced."
2,Reads like a medical journal,I can't discourage this book enough. It takes the interesting world of tattooing and makes it into a bland history lesson that doesnt even emphasize the more interesting aspects of its past. Tattooing is one subject that is generally vey interesting no matter how you study it but this book manages to make it boring. At times it gets so far off the subject you wonder why you dont just read a real history book instead. Very bland and reads like a medical journal.
5,Wow...,This CD revives any wandering Christian soul. I cry whenever I listen to it. It makes you think about your walk with Christ.YOU NEED THIS CD.
3,Wasn't What I Thought It Would Be,"I thought this CD would be Christian music, but only a few songs were. The rest were pop songs. It came packaged well and the condition of the CD was good."
5,My Favorite CD!,"I don't know if it's possible to have an all time favorite CD, probably because there's always something better from Michael that comes along, but I love this CD! I think it's going to get warped from being in my car CD player all the time. If you're looking for a great album with positive uplifting lyrics and fantastic melodies that make you feel like rocking, this is the CD to get! I first heard ""Place in This World"" on AC radio and was introduced to CCM music, and have been a fan since. The new songs on this album are great. ""Do You Dream of Me"" has to be one of my favorites MWS songs. The only problem I have with the album is they forgot to add ""Somebody Love Me"" and ""For You"". I just want the CD to be longer, but it still ranks up in my top five of all time favorites albums."
5,"Great ""Best of"" CD","What can I say, I love this ambum. Not a dud to he heard. The only thing that I wish is that it was a double (or triple) ambum, so it could have been a true ""best of"" CD. Highly recommended."
3,Didn't last,"This hair dryer started out great and I loved the added night light feature. It did not last long at all so now I'm shopping for something to replace it. My poor wall, this will be the third dryer. I am beginning to wonder if there is a wallmount dryer that lasts more than a year."
4,Love it,I love my new wall mounted hair dryer. It's like being in a hotel room. I would recommend this item to anyone.
4,Wallmount hair dryer,"I owned this exact product for about 5 years before it ""died"". I was pleased with its performance, so I purchased the same dryer again. My only objection was that the plastic clips which hold the dryer in place broke easily, and the part of the cord that attaches to the dryer came loose. Both of these things happened within a couple of years, but did not impair the functioning of the product."
5,love it,We had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper. We were so happy to find them again and they discounted $10 for buying two. That's so great. It is awesome not to have to look for your hairdryer and put it away each time!
2,"Owned two - both ""died""","When I first saw this model I was excited about the practicality of it's wall mount design, and the sleek styling it offered. It's 1600 watts supplied ample drying power, and the unit even has the ability to be shut off from the handset... a feature I am very fond of! The problem; they don't last! My first one lasted about 9 months and then began to continually overheat and shut off several times during my styling process. Blowing into the back got old pretty quick, and in the hope that I just got that one lemon, I decided to order another. I've owed my present unit for not quite a year now, and a few days ago I went to turn it on, and it just wouldn't. Terminal. I find myself again in need of a new wall mounted hair dryer, dreading removing this one and remounting the next. I'm presently seeking a better made model, after all, if you're going to mount something on your wall, you want it to last more than a year, no?"
4,Very Compact,This item is great if you have a small bathroom like I do. It hangs on the wall and is convenient. It doesn't have any features and only two speeds may be a drawback for some. But that is really all I need. It has no attachments but I just use my own brush to control my hair as I blow dry.
3,A good buy - and it lasted 5+ years,"The dryer is small but packs enough punch for my wife. Installed the unit when we remodeled in 1998 and it just died this morning. I'm buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won't have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value."
1,6' coil cord does not re-coil,"I would expect a ""coil cord"" to re-coil. This does not. It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try. I did not over do it. I went about 3 feet at most. I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched. What is the point of a coiled cord. I could simply use a regular dryer with a hook. I had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation...not to test the cord. I am returning this ""defective"" product."
3,burnout,i have owned about 8 of these in the last 7 years. plastic piece on holder always breaks and unit burns up after 9 months and i'm getting ready to buy # 9
4,Great little hairdryer,"Works great, looks good and was easy to install.The only con....wish it had a longer cord."
3,Wall mount review,I bought this handy little hair dryer and it works great for drying hair. The only problem is it makes a humming noise when its plugged in and not being used. Its very annoying. I thought there was something wrong with the first one and exchanged it and the second one does the exact same thing.
3,Nice dryer but a few draw backs,"I really liked how it dries and the general look. I've owned two older models and then just bought the newest model. The older ones got clogged in the filter area and had to be cleaned (one just stopped working - and smelled like over heating) -- the next one I learned to clean. This latest one I bought because I thought I would start fresh at my new condo. But they only had a version with a nightlight, which I didn't need, but I ordered anyway. For some reason when it is plugged in it has a low buzz, as if the night light is doing something. When I hit the reset button it goes away. Then about a month after installing, it fell off the wall. I had used the sticky mount option, instead of screw mounting. Before I screw mount something, I want to find another dryer that doesn't buzz and won't get clogged and burn out on me."
5,Love my hairdryer,I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another. I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there. Just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go. Great product.
5,This is the second unit like this that I have had. I like it and use it everyday.,I needed a wall mount for space . The unit is compact and easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,Very Good,"A great product and works perfectly. I love that the dryer is off the bathroom counter. The mounting directions were a little confusing, though. And the back plate was a little tough to get off."
3,Still Lake,I imagine this is one of the author's first attempts at writing romantic suspence. It's a fluffly story with nice characters but I figured out the villan shortly into the book.
3,Ok Story but Sophie was really stupid.,"Thsi story is ok but goodness for Sophie to be so smart she really was stupid sometimes. I like Griffin's brooding personality but he really like Sophie. The small town was really interesting. Marty's story was cute, too. Worth the read but not excellent."
4,Good read but ...,This was a good fast read but leaves little in the males character development. I think that the mals character needed to be more in depth. The book does have you wanting to read more. This is my second Anne Stuart book but as the other reviews say it apparently is not her best. But always read for yourself to see... Iw ill still read Anne I think her writing style is easy and very satisfying.
2,It's nothing special....,"I usually like Anne Stuart's books, but there are a few major inconsistencies in STILL LAKE that strongly detract from the conclusion. The story line hinges on one of the characters behaving in a way that is highly unlikely and to put is plainly -stupid. There is also doubt that the villain would be able to behave in the manner described. I won't go into further detail for fear of spoiling the book for others. Despite all this, there is nothing special about STILL LAKE. There is little that is original or remarkable. As far as suspense, I had no trouble whatever putting it down and was never caught up in the suspense.Anne Stuart has done much better in the past."
3,Not much romance in this book,Courtesy of A Romance ReviewStill Lake starts off with an unsolved murder in a beautiful Vermont town. The whole story is swirled around and clouded with suspense and mysteries. It isn't difficult to identify the real killer but you won't be sure until you read through the book. The portion of romance is quite little when comparing to the suspense and mysteries.
4,A quick but interesting read,"I enjoyed the book. It wasn't difficult to figure out ""whodunnit"" but the cast of characters kept my interest. The romance was fairly typical but the people weren't. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a break from their problems for a few hours."
1,Not recommended,"After having seen many of these clips with excellent comments by Bob Saget, the lousy commenting was a disappointment. Also the editing was not good, with some repeats! There are a few funny clips in here, but most of the TV shows are better."
5,This is funny stuff!,I got this for easter. I think this is just hilarious! I'm going to get a puppy this weekend. I hope it does some of the funny things that these animals do! buy it!
3,MAYBE I WAS EXPECTING MORE ~~~~~~~~~,"I DID enjoy this book; however, I maybe was expecting too much. I loved the characters, the conversations, the observations, the plot. I was just left wanting more from the book -- a deeper plot, more information, longer conversations, more detail --Carrie was a good lead character and I loved her garage sale life style. Being an avid garage saler myself, I could really relate to how she described that life and the treasures she would find along the way. Very true and realistic!!The plot was good, as stated in previous other reviews. The characters were believeable and true to life. I love books set in the South and this one was a good example of Southern lit.However, this is a GOOD BOOK and shouldn't be missed. I will keep my eyes open for more from Ms. Chappell. She is a good author, full of potential."
4,Modern Brazilian pop-jazz,"A well-crafted set of MPB ballads, which should appeal to fans of Gal Costa and Maria Bethania's cabaret-oriented style. Lucinha, who was married to pop-jazz composer Ivan Lins, is backed here by pianist Gilson Peranzzetta and his ensemble. Rio-born songwriter Sueli Costa was a favorite of slick '70s performers such as Simone, Joanna, Ney Matogrosso, Fafa de Belem, Maria Bethania, and -- one would assume -- Joao Bosco, especially since she collaborated often with Aldir Blanc. Costa recorded sparingly in the late 1970s; this affectionate tribute should help bring her music to the attention of a new generation of MPB fans."
1,disappointed,initially these headphones worked pretty good. the sound was good and they fit well. the problem was they stopped working after a month. they were also missing the carrying pouch.
3,Comfy but low in bass response,"Like it was already mentioned in other reviews these headphones are very comfortable as they sit outside of the ear canal so that you can wear them for hours during strenuous physical activities (like running in the gym or whatever) with no pain or any discomfort. However, these headphones leave much more to be desired when it comes to bass response - little or no bass can be heard depending on how far you jam them into your ear canal. So if your MP3 player does not have a 'bass booster' feature I would continue looking - I've had much more bass on flimsy $20 Sony Walkman headphones (although they broke a few month into gym routine). Otherwise, these headphones feel like they are going to last for a while, definitely are comfortable and provide reasonably good sound (unless you work out in an extremely noisy environment)."
3,Fair Game,This sound production is great quality. However I am concerned that it is marketed for Sports application. I used it while running on a treadmill for 3 minutes and then I was getting shocked in my left hear. I won't be using this product for jogging or running anymore because of that fact however I will be using it for listening to music while computing.regards
2,Better off with a $10 pair....disappointing,"Purchased these expecting them to last longer than the 3-4 months that my sony's lasted. Usually use them for working out, but also for when I sleep. These wore out in less than two months - the wires coverings split in several places. I guess I'll go back to my $10 pair from Sony."
1,became waterlogged after a couple months,"These headphones initially worked great: fit well, good sound. But after a couple of months of use, the sweat from running waterlogged the speakers, even though these headphones were marketed as sweat & water resistant. The speakers still work, but the sound is very muted and poor quality. I would NOT recommend these headphones for any activity involving moderate to heavy sweating."
2,un tres bon acaht,Il a un très bon mais les morceaux de plastiques ne tiennent pas sur les écouteurs.
1,Don't waste your money on these overpriced headphones!,"I have been on an endless search for headphones that I can use while running that provide good sound quality and are comfortable. I have had little luck, so at this point I am now just trying to find something that doesn't hurt!I was very excited to get this particular headphone! I thought for sure it would be my answer. Boy, was I ever wrong!! Just to give you an idea of what poor design they are... I am back to using the buds that came with my Ipod.The sound quality on this set is poor unless you really push the headphone deep down into the ear. The part that wraps around the ear is painful."
2,Ear buds are big and don't stay in ear,I thought the sound quality was good...however the ear buds are to big for your ears and fall out as soon as you move or sweat.
1,Worst Ever....Seriously,"These are just the worst head phones I've ever purchased. They do not stay in your ears when you go for a run, nor do they stay in when you wear them sitting at your computer. I bought these off of Amazon when they were $35.00 dollars, and its no wonder they've come down so much in price....they're just a terrible product."
3,Good product; has issues,"I tend to agree with some of the reviews that I read. The sound quality is really nice, but you need some sort of text-book perfect ears or the earphones don't stay on (only my left ear is text-book!). It works OK on a plane, but not at the gym or while walking around town.Also, while it really does not matter to me since I don't use them, the product description (and packaging) both say that there is a case included, but that is absolutely untrue. I only mention it cause someone who wants all of what they paid for might be pissed if they order this product and find it incomplete."
2,"Not great, not horrible","I try to use these for running, but not good. The design prevents me from running the cord down my back and staying put on the ear. It only stays in place when the cord is hanging down my front. The sound is poor. These are not as good as the apple ipod headphones these replaced."
3,Bad Fit; Great Sound,"I bought these to replace a cheap pair of headphones I had for my iPod. I did a lot of research and read a ton of reviews, so my expectations were high.As soon as I got the phones out of the box, I had a problem. They would not fit into my ears properly. I could get them to sit in my ears after some fanagling, but as soon as I started lifting weights or running, they would slip out.Now, as far as sound is concerned, they sounded wonderful. I heard piano in a System of a Down song...I didn't know they used piano!! If you can get them to stay in your ears, they sound great.If it weren't for the bad fit, I easily would have given these ear phones 5 starts. I should point out that they fit perfectly for my wife and she loves them."
3,Great for running - but not very powerful,"These are the best headphones I've found for running. As a runner I need comfortable headphones, and these fit the bill. The anti-tangle cord is great and works well. Sound quality is decent but not great. Good enough for exercise 'phones. The only real problem is the max volume is quite low."
3,Good Sound but Poor Quality,"I like the sound from theses headphones, but the cord split open. I sent them back for repairs."
2,Try before you buy.,"I guess the title says it, but it's impossible when you buy online.Anyway, I got these headphones 6 months ago for working out, mainly cause they are waterproof. I really like the behind the ear design. But these don't fit at all. Not sure if my ears are too big or too small, but the only time they work is if I'm sitting perfectly still. You can forget about working out and running is out of the question. Even when they don't fall out, they fill like they are.The sounds quality is OK, but the bass is really lacking.I'm sticking with the Philips SHS3200. They usually stop working every 4 - 6 months, but they only cost $10."
1,Not worth the money,"After hearing good things about the sound quality, I broke down and bought a pair of these. I usually run with similar Sony headphones available at one-third the price. Sound quality was marginally better with these, but I was severely disappointed to find that within thirty days of moderate use, the outer insulation cracked and separated at every contact point: at the plug, at each earphone, and even at the Y splitter. For the money, and as ""sports"" headphones, this material should be tougher and more flexible and not prone to tearing like this.Fortunately, the seller refunded my money without question or hesitation. But it will take some convincing to get me to try a Sennheiser product again."
2,"Good sound, great afterservice but has failed twice","Sennheiser product quality is well known and respected. Therefore, I cannot understand why within eight months of use (workouts on bicycle, Ellipticals, Treadmills)I continue to have failure problems. First one side goes out and then the other. I think there is a problem with the copper wire connections. Has anyone else had this problem? I do have to say that the Service Center does quickly replace the product if under the two year warranty"
1,"Comfort = +1 star, utterly horrible sound = -5 stars","Sorry, but these headphones are junk. They have about as much base as a worn out pellet gun. They're comfy and stay on well while running, but you would honestly get better sound from a pair of speakers plugged into your ipod and strapped to your waist. Thin, tinny sound, just awful."
2,Poor wiring - good sound,"The wires wore in numerous locations in less than 2 months. The gage is too small to hold up to active use. I would strongly suggest looking at an alternative.The sound quality is good which is typical of Sennheiser, but they have to improve the materials to justify the purchase."
3,"Not great, but the best I've found so far for running","It must be impossible to make headphones for suitable for running that 1) Stay in place without bouncing or making rude noises in your ear canal; 2) Allow some intrusion of outside sound like traffic or someone yelling and 3) Sound decent. I've been through about eight different designs and there's always some compromise among these three requirements. The OMX70's are very comfortable and don't block all exterior sound, but they just don't sound that great. The bass response is poor, even with the ""bass booster"" EQ turned on on the iPod. They're also not very efficient as I have to crank the volume all the way up when running.Pros: Look good, cord resists tangling, very comfortable, adjustable.Cons: Weak volume, weak bass, expensive.I'll keep these for now and continue my quest for the Grail."
2,not a good fit for small ears,I just bought a pair of these and took them out for a run and I couldn't get them to stay on comfortably. I have pretty small ears and have trouble with the over-the-ear style but I thought because these were adjustable they would work. Not the case. Sound quality would have been ok if the speakers would have stayed in my ears. The buds were also hard and not comfortable.
3,"Good Sound, but Poor fit","I purchased these as a replacement for a pair of Sonies that I had had for the past 4 years. The sound on dhtese are great for earbud-headphone, but I can't get these to stay in my ears. No matter how I posistion them they keep sliding out."
3,Did not stay in my ears once I began to sweat,"Out of the box I loved these headphones. The colorand the build were both very appealing to meand very cool. However, once I started to workout on the treadmill, they began to fall out of place.Could I still hear the music? Yes.Did they fall completely off my head? No.Did they feel like they would fall off my head? Yes.I guess the earbud did not fit my ear properly. It would fit in place initially, but after I began to sweat and the jarring of my run started, they would pop out of place. I tried all the optgional parts and still the same outcome.In the end, I returned them and got the Nike Skylor headphones. They fit my ears much better and the sound quality is just as good."
1,terrible,"Long time runner here, these were terrible. The fit was mediocre even with the so called features. Not even close to good sounding compared to a 5$ head phone. Stay simple, skip these."
1,"Nice in theory, but not in reality...","Product would sound fine, if it would stay in or anywhere close to the ear canal. But it really doesn't. The 'adjustable' ear pieces really aren't that adjustable, only in moving the positioning up or down about 1/4 of an inch. There is not much flexibility in these things and they don't feel that great in the ears. I bought them for running and the stay on the ear, but again, no where even near to being in the ear and enjoying what you're listening to. Another thing, if you wear glasses, these are NOT for you. Do not buy these as they will not work at all around your ears and the frames of your glasses. Even with my glasses off, they weren't really that good. I bought the v-moda's and have been super happy with them!"
4,headphones for running,Sennheiser PMX70 Sport Line Stereo Neckband HeadphonesGreat for running. dont fall off and dont cause blisters like some do when running marathons. Good sound quality too.
1,Poor design,Had these earphones for a little over 1 year. Sounded fine and held up under exercise usage. Wire covering has now split exposing the wire in 5 different parts of the wire and is now unusable. I did not cause the damage. Might not have bought them if I knew this could occur.
3,Ear Phones Deluxe!,"This is a high quality set of ear phones. I have trouble with those small plug type phones, they just won't stay in my ears. But that is not a problem with these because they wrap right around the ear! I give five stars for quality but only two for the price as I think they are a little high. So overall I give three stars."
3,Still falls out,It still manages to fall off when I'm running fast and hard. Stays on fine if I'm jogging on the treadmill. Sounds is good.
1,cheap qualiiy for premium price,poor fit poor sound outrageous color sums up an overpriced headset not as good as a $9 cvs headset dont buy it!
3,Comfortable but not great sound,"I've had these for a couple of years now and have to say they are not as good as I expected. The fit is confortable, but the actual earplug does not have a great fit in the ear which makes the sound quite bad. Because of the lack of fitting, there are pretty much sound leakage which makes you want to turn up the volume which make the sound ever worse. Also, the cord gets tangled up pretty easy."
4,"Good, practical earphones","Good sound reproduction. But best for me, they don't fall out, and are still very light and comfortable"
1,Quality product but horrible design,"Definitely a mistake picking these up. Audio quality is good for the price, but the earbuds WILL NOT stay in my ears. I have determined that this has to do with the fact that I have a pronounced Tragus. If you're perplexed right now search for it on wikipedia. It's the flap of cartilage that hangs over the opening of your ear. If yours is large it will prevent the earbuds from properly fitting in your ear canal and I suggest you find a different pair of headphones."
1,Dangerous,I bought this game for my ten year old and now he wants a gun. He borrowed mine but apparently this game doesn't actually teach gun handling skills and now our cat is dead. Would not recommend this game.
1,I didn't realize it would make me killer,"I was fine with my AK47 and Barret 50 Cal happily hunting deer and small game, and then I played this and became psychopathic killer. If only we had armed guards on every corner, that the government didn't pay for or control...."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME,"This is perhaps one of the single most horrendous games to ever come from a third-rate game creator. Truth be told, Crave Entertainment is probably more like a 4th rate creator. The graphics are painful to look at, the guns are LAME, the sound effects of the weapon discharge sound like they were made by banging two trash can lids together. Actaully, they're so weak they probably WISH they sounded like two trash can lids.NRA Gun Club could very well be the single worst game in the history of games, and I assure you I am not being dramatic here. Go look for a review on a website like gamespot. Although if you do, you're wasting your time. This game is pure garbage, and Crave Entertainment should be as ashamed of itself as I am."
1,Truly Terrible,"Possibly the worst shooting game I've ever laid my eyes on, let alone played. The graphics are poor for its time, the gameplay is downright boring, and the guns aren't accurately depicted. It doesn't show how to handle guns, and doesn't even bother with their function, largely. There isn't any noticeable sway, wind, or other obstacles to the players shooting, and the input is too coarse for the controller. Honestly, just bad. STAY AWAY."
1,Awful Game from awful organization,"So the NRA says that violent video games are the problem, yet they themselves sell shooting games. Well this game is not only awful, but it is produced by an awful organization. Do not buy this!"
1,Are you people serious?,"Anybody who buys his ""game"" deserves it. Only a complete bone head would purchase something like that for their kid. It's a great training aid for future school shooters though."
1,Mixed Messages,I don't get it? Mortal Kombat is the reason for America's gun violence problems but this game isn't? Does that make it ok to shoot up a school/cinema then if the only game I have ever played is this one?
1,Didn't live up to expectations,"Full disclosure: I had nightmares for weeks after seeing the loading screen of Kindergarten Killers and wanted to avoid vicious, violent video games with names like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse. I thought NRA Gun Club would be a nice way to have some wholesome fun. Boy, was I wrong! Not only was it just as much a video game about shooting stuff as all the other ones, but it sucked too. At least I can understand why NRA President Wanye LaPierre so conveniently forgot his organization put there namesake on it."
3,Impossible,It's hard to aim steadily even if you zoom in. The sounds are ok but if the aiming and gameplay were a little more easier to handle I would have probably enjoyed this game more.
3,It's good but nothing close to James Brown or MC5.,"I'm tired of The Make-Up being compared to ""Gospel"" acts and the MC5. The Lead singer sounds like any other guy trying to impersonate James Brown in his underwear blasting the stereo. You need to give The Make-Up a few listens before judging them. I bought ""In Mass Mind"" and hated it at first but now I can dig it. The Make-Up need to come up with new material though because the same formula gets boring after a number of listens."
2,Disappointing Product,"I just bought one second hand - should have read the reviews first. I have used several jogging strollers, but this one is very poorly designed. the front wheel attachment is very unstable, and as a result, the jogger has a tendency to pull to the left - spent more effort trying to keep it in a straight line than pushing it! Also, front wheel shows premature wear and warps. As a bike trailer only, it is adequate. However, attaching it to the bike can be challenging - best if you can do it once and leave it on. All in all, disappointing product from Little Tykes. You get what you pay for!"
2,Sheesh!,"In the 2 years that I've had the cruiser behind a bike, both the wheels have already warped. Not what I expeced from Little Tykes. I'm having to deal w/buying new tires frequently due to flats because of the wheels. Now the whole thing wobbles making for a bumpy ride. Add to the fact that I couldn't purchase replacement wheels online. Ughhh!"
2,Very Disapointed!,"I purchased the Cozy Cruizer second-hand at a yard sale. Considering that the price we paid was only 1/8th the cost of one new, we couldn't resist. Not good! We haven't had much difficulty in attaching it to our adult bikes; our problem was with the wheels. The plastic rims do not last and can very easily warp, making seating the tire pointless since it will very quickly pop off once you start inflating.In hindsight, we should have purchased a bike trailer with real bike wheels (ie. metal rims and spokes). I would have thought that buying a Little Tikes product would have resulted in quality-especially for the price!"
5,Welcome to the Hall of Fame George,"This book captures the entire story of Brett's career from childhood through his many years with the Kansas City Royals. Great photographs and layout compliment the authoring by Steve Cameron. Unlike other books on Brett, this book is an autobiography. A ""must"" for any baseball fan."
3,I don't know about this one,"I really don't know about this one. It started out really interesting but just fell off in the end. It was really wierd, because I really went from one end of the spectrum to the other. I really like it to I really don't? After a while it kinda got all artsy and confusing. Maybe it was suppose to , but I think that the guy making this film wanted you to think too much. Could have been alot better if it explained more. It was alright."
2,a bore,"This film is too long, getting bogged down in confusing and complex jumpy scenes.The first third of the movie was nearly impossibe to hear, and the closed caption so fast that I had to continually press pause to study the dialogue. Why the cough? It seemed to play a prominent role, but led to nothing. The cover on the DVD is misleading. I kept watching even though it was tedious, because I thought there would be a thriller ending with a murder. I long suspected a dumb ending and it certainly was."
2,This film escaped me?,"Adam Goldberg's attempt at David Lynch didn't quite make the grade...this film just escaped me. I somewhat got it but didn't, what I mean is it was just all over the place and very hard to follow. I feel Goldberg just tried to hard to be artsy and surreal to the point of confusion. To me it just seemed like a celebrity who was losing his mind! The ending had no real catharsis or explain much did not make sense. Maybe I just really didn't get this film and I'm a fan of Adam Goldberg."
5,Beautiful,This ring looks exactly like it does in the picture. It is nice and sllek and I am very happy with it. The ring may appear to be heavy but surprisingly it isn't that bad.
4,Insights into evaluating security risks,"I'm not a statistician or a risk expert, so I mainly view this book in terms of illuminating possible areas of risk. It was interesting to see how a threat could be evaluated, but I spent most of my time reading the initial threats portion at the beginning of each chapter. These were interesting enough.The text is a little uneven, which is most likely from the multiple authors. The graphics are poor quality. And the organization could use some work.I would have liked to have been inspired to appreciate the characterization portions of the book, but I was not moved to do so."
4,Bosch 4000-09 Worksite 15 Amp 10-Inch Benchtop Table Saw with Gravity Rise Wheeled Stand,[...]Love the gravity stand.effortless and light to haul around.
3,I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.,"This is a very nice table saw, and has the best stand in the business.I really like the soft start, and it's fairly quiet. The two major problems I have with it are: The fence when clamped is not square. You have to physically bump it with your hand to true it up. Secondly, I'm already on my second motor in a year. I know to plug it in direct when I can, but realistically you need an extention cord sometimes. The repairman said it's pretty typical of these motors to fry when used on a cord. But on a positive note Bosch replaced it for free. Overall still a very nice saw. My old DeWalt was more reliable though."
3,"Decent, but not great.","I'm a full time frame to finish carpenter. My boss purchased one of these for the site about nine months ago, to replace an old makita.Pros:Good smooth powerStableCons:Rip fence is very light and cheesy; you have to check for square before every cut.There is no wheel for the bevel setting, you just have to swing the motor and man-handle itWe've burned through one motor alreadyI own a Ridgid job site saw, which I greatly prefer over the Bosch. The fence is worlds better, and there are some subtle improvements that make the saw more of a pleasure to work with. I have also used the dewalt, and would buy that over the Bosch as well."
4,Great saw,"I am really pleased with my new Bosch saw. The saw was delivered on time and in perfect condition. I was amazed that the rip fence,blade and miter guide were ALL exactly right on. The yellow cut mark circle is even helpful. Of course the only reason I only gave it 4 stars was the usual reasons; 1,The blade provided is fair. 2,The rear outfeed extension is NOT included. 3, I'll also have to order the cheap plastic inserts so I can use them as templates to make my own. Dah! The saw;with a new blade; cuts great. Plenty of power. And the stand works really great in my small shop."
4,Close to perfect portable saw,"This saw is made in Taiwan, not China. There IS a difference, called quality. It was packed very carefully and well. I had no problems putting together the stand and then mounting the saw on it. Very clear and easy to understand directions. Took about 25 minutes. It is very high quality. I had just one problem-setting the saw arbor parallel to the miter slot. It was off. You must do this to avoid kickback. It took me an hour to finally get the arbor parallel. Once that was done, it was time to go to work. It did great on plywood, oak and ash, both ripping and crosscut. The rip fence was a big surprise-its parallel to the blade and its rugged. This is not a stationary heavy weight saw. Its made to be portable and even has a dust chute that gets about 90% of the chips-not bad. Get a vacuum hook-up or the bag they sell for it. The folding table adjustment is awesome. If not for the parallel problem, this saw would get 5 stars."
1,Motor is junk,"Used it for one month and motor went to half speed. Sent it back to factory for repair, then used it for another month and it did the same thing. Called repair center and asked if this is a problem; he said it shouldn't do it that soon, but they do have problems with it. I used it on the jobsite where I have to use extension cords - do not purchase if you have to use extension cords."
5,one-man-show tool,"I bought the saw because of a review in a trade magazine. I was tired of lugging my old ""portable"" table saw and having to re-assemble it at the job site. The folding stand with wheels is perfect for me. Truely portable for one person.This saw seems to have plenty of power. It is as accurate as you could ask for with a portable rig. Top 'o the line in this category."
3,"Overrated,better choices","As other have said there is a lot of plastic and the elevation gears TOO! They are only available as an assembly and are not cheap and are hard to repair.This is not a ""onsite cab saw "" as suggested. If you want an onsite saw that can perform, get a contractor saw w. a CI top for the same or less $. This is,like all the other portables, a total compromise in design for mobility and not as good as even the most basic regular contractor design in performance."
5,Great saw,"This is my second table saw. The first one was a Craftsman contractors saw that was given to me. Before purchasing this saw I spent about a month doing research on various table saws. I was going to buy the Ridgid similar to this one, but after reading countless reviews and noticing its quirkiness I decided on the Bosch. The fence stays parallel. Part of the raising/lowering system ARE plastic, but look to be very well made. It was very easy to put the saw and the stand together. I spent about an hour reading through the included manual and putting it together. Read the directions before using. It will tell you what and what not to do (obviously). I purchased the left extension, the outfeed extension, as well as the dust bag. Overall it is an excellent saw! Highly recommended."
2,Self Centering Rip Fence Doesn't Center,"I bought this saw for two main reasons. I like it compactness and the supposed accuracy of the rip fence and the self centering feature. I used my saw for the first time yesterday (after having verified all measurements for accuracy. Everything was fine except the rip fence did not self align. I followed the manual to adjust it and could not get it true to the blade. The fence, no matter at what distance from the blade was 1/16"" to 1/8"" off at the front of the fence when measured to the front and back of the blade. I am very discouraged and am considering returning the saw for a full refund."
2,died too young,"Bought my saw 2 years ago at amazon, thought it was the greatest thing ever, UNTIL last week. The motor quit and I'm looking at at least half the price of a new saw. Too much money for a disposable saw. Bosch was no help either."
4,Shelcore Shake n Bobble Shape Sorter Dump Truck,"My 1 yr old son received this toy as one of his christmas presents. I can tell he enjoys playing with it. He likes throwing the shapes into the truck and fitting them into the shape sorter. It does not run to well though on carpet only on floors. Overall, it seems pretty fun for him."
5,Beautiful,"My daughter-in-law registered this pattern at Bed Bath and Beyond when they got married, but BBB did not carry the gravy boat. I found it on Amazon and was so happy to give this to her. It is absolutely beautiful. Amazon had it packed so well and it arrived in perfect condition. And even arrived several days before it was promised."
5,Way Cool,"This book has so many wonderfully funny parts - Ce'nedra jumping up ""OH, NO!"", Relg's and Taiba's ""little theological discussions"", ""This isn't going to work, Rhodar,"" Anheg turned to the rotund monarch in disgust, ""What are we going to call her? The Overlady of the West?"", and so on. I memorized what is given of Ce'Nedra's first speech. I love these books! Breathe deep, seek peace. Tin"
2,Surprise! You're the Savior of the World!,"Against all odds, Garion manages to be surprised at the fact that he is the heir to the long-vacant Rivan throne, and hence the one destined to duel the evil god Torak. He deals with this with reasonable equanimity, all things considered. Then he takes the two most interesting characters he can find (Belgarath and Silk) and heads off to get the duel over with.The womenfolk are left behind to rally the armies of the western kingdoms, which thankfully all have different colored uniforms and completely different, though complementary, military strengths. But the whole campaign is really a diversion, you know... the armies of the West marching against hopeless odds to divert attention from the one bearing the dangerous artifact to the heart of the land of darkness... say, haven't I read this story before?"
5,This is the eason Garion has been going around the world on a certin quest,"Castle of Wizardry is about a boy named Garion. Garion is a young wizard that has to go on a long quest that is in the prophecy for him to kill the evil god Torak. On the way to kill Torak, Garion has to get the Orb of Aldur to Riva. once he got the Orb to Riva he has to put the Orb on this great sword when he did the whole world shook. When this happen the God Torak awoke from his slumber and started looking for his Sword. Garion has to marry Ce'Nedra. Before he can marry her he has to set off to kill Torak and save the world from total destruction. The reason Garion and Torak have to fight is because Garion is the child of light and Torak is the child of darkness and destruction. Garion does not whant t fight the god but he has to because this is all describe in the prophicythat is fortold"
4,"A familiar, enjoyable ride","No great surprises await in the series but it's a skillful weave of sharply defined created peoples, gods and cultures. Probably unappreciated for its deceptive simplicity, in actuality, Eddings is to be commended for making it all look so simple. If you want a familiar-seeming tale with an upbeat bent, then the Belgariad is for you."
5,"Brilliant, well written, funny, fantastic.","I have read all four books as well as Belgarath the Sorcerer.The Castle of Wizardry is brilliant,funny and the characters are great you feel as if you know them all i can't wait to finish reading the series although i will be sad at the same time knowing that i have finished it.....but i can always read the series again."
3,"Good first half, boring second half.","The quest for the orb's climatic finish finally occurs in this book. Garion and everyone else in the group finally battle for the orb. In a dramatic battle, the orb is taken, and all seems well. This is the first half of the book, and it was a dousy.The second half of the book, however, is dull and tedious. No real adventure occurs. It's merely a read about the management and ruling of the world, and about the princess's feelings. Nothing more than that. The series takes a dramatic turn downhill after the orb is taken, and it is by far the worst part of the series. It's tedious and dull at this point.Edding has the usual stuff going for him - his language - the characters - the development of the prophecy - and the characters. The arguments between the slave women and the Ulgo are hilarious and witty. Though probably the worst book in the series, it is still not too bad."
4,The story great! The characters lovably! Never dull!,"I enjoyed this book, this series, and has become one of my favourites. It is is light or heavy read depending on how much you want to get out of it. His characters have believable personalities, especially the ones who have lived thousands of years. Belgarath and Beldin have enough sceptisism and hope in their characters to make them truely lovable. The story itself is full of twist that kept me coming back. The only disapointment was Errand/Eriond, I guessed his fate before the end, but still wasn't to big of a disapointment, it finished so well. Eddings will be hard pressed to dupicate the sucess of this series. I hope he writes more with these characters. Did I detect a bit of sarcasism ? Mr. Eddings Thank you."
3,Great Beginning That Runs Out Of Gas.,"The first half of the book promised to be the best in the series so far, but once they reached the mysterious orb, the book seemed to climax and then meander to the end. (Which by the way, was hardly an end, but more a chapter break.) This time out it's really Garion's story for the first half, and Ce'Nedra's for the second, and as interesting as she's become, the politics and posturing to set up the final act dragged me down a bit. Hopefully the last book will finish with a bang and not a whimper."
1,Uncomfortable Florsheim Shoes,I'm really disappointed with the quality and workmanship of the Florsheim shoes. The leather is so tough that they are uncomfortable to wear. I wore them just once and will never wear them again. What a shame!
2,"If you have a DCS-760, KEEP IT!","We owned the DCS-760 in our pro photo lab. The camera was great. Then, kodak came out with the DCS-14n as a replacement. It was a huge mistake. The DCS-14n's sensor is simply of lower quality, shadows sometimes come out magenta. There is also a flare issue. Grey gradients, depending on the density come out green or yellow. And there are other issues as well, but you get the point. In conclusion, the DCS-760 was a far better camera.Kodak recommends the use of a good lens with the DCS-14n to eliminate flare. We used the same lens to test both cameras, and the tests were performed under the same conditions. The results were very clear to us: keep the DCS-760."
5,"Great camera, but now serves a very limited need","I purchased the Kodak Pro SLR/N a good number of years ago. It is the successor to the featured Kodak DCS-14N. Since then, I have purchased five different Nikons to replace the work performed by the camera in my studio. Most notably, I recently purchased a Nikon D800 and a Nikon D800E.And yet, I keep a spot open for using the Kodak with a Zeiss 25mm for super sharp wide-angle, high resolution macro shots. Because I have restricted the camera to studio use, it's only failure is of little consequence to me. A full charge on the OEM battery is worth about fifty (maybe fifty-three) shots. Otherwise, the photos it produces are excellent - no noise and great color. For all my work, I keep the ISO at 400, or less."
3,Ghost camera,"How can anyone write a reveiw of this camera?No one in the WORLD has been able to use or reveiw it, let alone hold one.Kodak is 6 months behind release date on this camera and still has not shipped one. Lets reveiw it when it finally comes out."
4,Excellent study of the post-Conquest generation,"Newman, a noted scholar of the Norman period, came to history by way of a childhood fascination with her own family's history, and her work combines a deep interest in the lives of individuals with a profound understanding of the need for sociopolitical context. This book grew out of her dissertation, fostered by such luminaries as Warren Hollister and Joel Rosenthal, and it's an excellent social-biographical overview of the people who built the 12th century in Britain, using Helihy's ""generational"" methods. Successive chapters discuss the nature of the Anglo-Norman family unit and the world in which it existed, the mechanics of royal service and the royal patronage which was its reward, and the strategies which successful nobles adopted in furthering their careers and family status. An interesting appendix also discusses at length ""The Problem of the Bastard"" -- not a small subject under Henry I!"
5,Pilgrim's Progress,Great reading!! And describes our Christian walk from beginning to the end. I would reccomend Pilgrim's Progress for all ages.
5,pilgrims progress,My church is studying Pilgrim's Progress on Sunday evenings. I plan on loaning the book to my grandchildren as I know they will enjoy reading this book.
5,Pilgrim's Progress,VERY fast shipping. I received the book within two days of placing the order. Very impressive. Book in excellent condition. Recommend these people highly!
5,Good quality,I have several varieties of original issue ripstop and these are very similar to the originals in terms of design and quality.
4,Vintage Vietnam Od Fatigue Pants,"These are really comfortable and are like the ones I wore while I was in Vietnam. The quality is really good and for the price, not to bad. Leg pockets are very handy for storing extra things and the blousing strings can be laced to keep out insects, weeds, etc,"
2,Pants too small,Pants too small. Tag inside said 43 - 47. When measured they were 44's. Must have been made in China.
4,Nice pants - HUGE,There was not enough sizing info on the site that sells these pants.....I am a 44-46 waist and these pants were big enough to build a tent out of them? Great material! Light weight and will be very comfortable when I get the right size from the company.....
1,A BAD PICK,I ORDERED ONE SIZE OF PANT AND THE LABEL ON THE PAIR THEY SENT ME SAID IT WAS THE NEXT SIZE UP FROM WHAT I ORDERED. WHEN I TRIED THEM ON IT SEEMS BOTH WERE WRONG THEY WERE ABOUT TWO SIZES TO SMALL. THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO REFUND MY MONEY AS SOON AS I CAN REMEMBER TO TAKE THEM TO THE MAILBOX. IF I HAD TO RATE THIS ITEM IT WOULD GET ONE STAR ONLY BECAUSE THEY AGREE TO REFUND.
4,The best of the beach movies.,"""Muscle Beach Party"" is the sharpest and funniest of the ""Beach Party"" movies. And it's the least dumb. That's saying a lot, really!The supporting cast is unbeatable--Buddy Hackett, Don Rickles, Peter Lupus (billed as Rock Stevens), Morey Amsterdam, and a last-minute appearance by Peter Lorre (as Lupus' father!).These were the first screen appearances of Stevie Wonder, who steals the musical portion of the flick, and Lupus, who is quite good as the ego-centered Flex Martian, chief muscleman in Rickles' stable. Why this movie works so well is a mystery, but it does. You could spend your money less wisely."
4,Saly Goes Traveling Again,"The book ""Sally Goes Traveling Alone"" was my daughter's favorite book when she was pre-school age. That was 34 years ago. I was pleased when I found it on Amazon. I was even more pleased when we received it. It was just as advertised. It was in very good condition and arrived promply. It was a pleasure to do business with Amazon and the seller."
4,"Boyfriend loved it, I thought it was ok",I brought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it and qoutes it all the time. It's a classic.
5,Hollywood Shuffle,"I have seen a lot movies that Robert Townsend played in and actually liked them so much that I would add them to my collections and look at dozen of time and never get tried looking at them. I wish I could get his and Leon E-mail, because I am a number one fan and I have some ideas to share with them."
2,Case was broken in the inside.,"When the item arrived everything was okay until I opened it. The plastic that is suppose to hold the CD in place was actually broken, and the CD wasn't secure. Which means the CD could have also arrived broken. Other than that the movie played fine."
2,Shuffling stereotypes,"""Hollywood Shuffle"" is a modest and sporadically amusing film about Hollywood stereotypes of African-Americans. Unfortunately, director/writer Robert Townsend doesn't hesitate to utilize his own stereotypes and put-downs of gay men in the film, who are treated as cheap laughs throughout. That a film that purports to expose bigotry in Hollywood can utilize and exploit such bigoted and stereotypical attitudes toward gays says more about Mr. Townsend than it does about Hollywood. Apparently, in Mr. Townsend's view, bigotry is OK as long as it's not directed at blacks; and if you're a victimized minority it's OK to put down another victimized minority."
5,Perfect,"I liked very much This serie And The actors, matt Bomer id so quide And very fin And handsome ,"
3,Love this show,I love this show. I was not happy about the video library with Amazon because I am a mac user and they only work with PC:(
3,"Good acting nice show, watchable.","I saw season one which I really enjoyed, season2 yes I enjoy it to but kind of like same ole same ole, there is an underlining plot but its so slow, Good watch, bettyer if I didn't pay for it."
4,Love it!,This show is one of the best and recommend it to everyone. So excited to have gotten this season on sale!
5,Two very good looking gentleman,I am Watching this movie now again. These are movies that one can watch over and over as the script is a little bit hard to follow with this 81 year old lady. But that is OK as Iove watching these two good looking gentleman play their part.
4,Great show!,"I love White Collar, but I was a little disappointed in this episode. I enjoyed it until the end, which I thought was weak and which tore at me. Judge for yourself."
1,What I bought is different from the picture,"The cover paper is different from the picture. The letter ""The complete second season"" printed on paper should be blue, but the letters on the DVD shipped to me are Black. It makes me wonder whether the DVD I bought is fake."
3,It's okay,"The only reason it's okay because the dvd didnt work and I had to send it back, if it had worked it would of got 5 stars"
1,Disappointing,There were a few enjoyable stories but it is definitely not worth buying. It seems like the authors didn't have enough material for a book but wrote one anyway. I was done with it in an hour.
5,Ancient Tales,"The main story of the Mahabharata is of the Pandava princes and their eventual victory over evil with the help of Krishna. But the Mahabharata is full of many smaller stories, generally told by various characters to illustrate a moral, spiritual, or philosophical point. This book tells some of those stories in a delightful and exciting way, so that modern readers can easily relish this ancient classic of India. It's great for both children and adults."
3,"Wrong Image, Right Part","The primary image for this belt tensioner is incorrect in every way; but, the second image looks correct.If this idler fails too soon (within the first 3-5 years, in my book), I will follow up with negative feedback.Otherwise, you can probably assume it's still working."
2,disorganized,"It seems to me that the top review here is just a rehash of the introduction to the book, almost in the exact words of the authors. I was disappointed with this book as it is very disorganized. The term database dump is used for a book which is just a collection of games from an opening taken from a computer and printed on paper. There is no organization to the book at all. I respect that two class players published a book, but they did not organize the material in a manner that will really be helpful to learn the opening, in my humble opinion."
5,awesome book! 5*,It is a great book! Has a lot of knowledge about our body that you might not even know!!
4,"Sizzling, Spicy and Scandalous","I enjoy the Black Lace series and always look forward to an exciting read, BUT, I usually find myself skipping pages and reading just the ""juicy"" parts- this was not the case. I was drawn in to an exciting plot, well written story and some of the most spicy reading that my tired eyes have read...EVER! It was a good mixture of betrayal, passion and revenge-- a real page turner! I enjoyed the poshness of the characters and the grahpic descriptions of the You-Know-What. The last Black Lace book I read was ""Tongue in Cheek"" and it was pretty mild compared to ""A Scandalous Affair"" This is one to read aloud to your significant other on a cold winter night... things will definately ""Heat Up""."
5,Medicine for the soul,"This album has the upbeat songs to give you the fight to get through a day you don't want to face, and the slower, healing songs when your heart is about to break. Rich Mullins' ministry through music has helped me through more than one crisis. I only wish God had left him with us longer."
5,Songs: classic Rich Mullins,"Rich Mullins was one of the best songwriters to bless Christian Music, and this represents some of his best work. If you are unfamiliar with the depth of his writing, you will be amazed at the honest appraisal of the human heart that he reveals.""If I stand, let me stand on the promise that You will pull me through; and if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You."""
5,The best songwriter since Dylan,"This was the first Rich Mullins album I bought - His honesty is refreshing in a world of sugarcoated Christian music. ""Creed"" is perhaps the best statement of Christian faith told in a modern way. ""Alrightokuhhuhamen"" spells it out what we are all called to do as Christians!"
5,"An ""Awesome"" album celebrating our Awesome God","This album is probably the closest to a ""Best of Rich Mullins"" album. It is impossible to listen to songs like ""Awesome God"" and ""Creed"" and not reflect on the power and majesty of Jesus Christ. The entire album is one huge praise and worship fest! It is perfect traveling and running music...I recommend it to anyone who wants a rock solid Christian album - one that you will play over and over again - an album that will continue to challenge and inspire you to grow in your Christian walk."
5,"""The truth is alive to shine upon the way..""","This CD embodies eloquence of lyrics whose sole purpose is to praise the Awesome God who gave us the gift of music in the first place. Probably, the most fascinating lyrics to me are in the song ""Calling Out Your Name"": ""I can feel the earth tremble /Beneath the rumbling of the buffalo hooves / And the fury in the pheasant's wings / And there is fury in a pheasant's wings / And it tells me the Lord is in His temple / And there is still a faith that can make the mountains move / And a love that can make the heavens ring / And I've seen love make heaven ring / Where the sacred rivers meet beneath / The shadow of the Keeper of the plains."" Ya just can't go wrong with this one."
5,Awesome God - awesome album,"A powerful album. I purchased this album Holy Thursday and have been listening to it every day since. It amazes me how every day there is a different song on this CD which speaks to the place I am in my faith journey. Thank you, Rich, for an obviously God inspired work and an absolutely must have Christian album."
5,An unparalleled assembly of contemporary Christian music,"If I could have only one CD to listen to for the rest of my life, this would be it. I never tire of listening to what has become this gifted man's legacy to the Kingdom on earth as he caught his chariot ride to the eternal Kingdom. Marvelous songs that encourage, inspire, comfort, and challenge, they're all here. His inspiration, drawn straight from Scripture and life, hits home in song after song. His lyrics and melodies get inside your heart, soul, and mind, and you find yourself drawn to them time after time. Add this CD to your collection, and you may never need to add another."
5,"Encouraging, up-lifting, powerful","Do you need encouragement, listen to the ""Songs"" CD by Rich Mullins. How great is our God? Listen to 'Awesome God'."
3,mullins cd,"This is a good cd. The price was good which caused me to buy this particular one. The negative is that the one song I really bought it for has a scratch in it and so it jumps. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,The most biased work available,"How anyone can rate this ""book"" highly just proves the severe bias against Hitler.I have been a Hitler historian for over thirty years and this is probably the worst work out there. It is full of lies, distortions, and half truths. Almost every passage is a bash on the man. I threw it away after one reading..."
3,trivial,"Not really a biography, rather barely related bits of trivia, some of it based on hearsay rather than established fact. A fast read, but don't expect to learn anything new or important."
4,"Have not read it yet, but plan to.",Always have been intrigued by this person. I want to know more. We should all be aware of how someone like him can come into power.
1,Reader beware..,"The author of this book set out to write about a subject he apparantly didn't understand. I don't know what his sources were, but if his readers actually believe most of the things he has written here as ""facts"", then they are as naive as he is. It is a small book full of hearsay and fabrications, making Fuchs's so-called ""Concise Biography"" anything but. This book is sad proof that anything can be published nowadays. This is definitely one to avoid."
5,The habits of Hitler,"Very different, not really about the war so much but more about the personality traits& daily habits of Hitler told by those that were employed by him.Easy read, short chapters about the Fuher's weirdness."
1,Useless book,This is a totally useless book for someone who seriously wants to study Islam or know life of Prophet Muhammed. What the author of this book has done is a classical example of quoting without background information and out of context.Hadith and Quran are a complex topic and anyone having a limited study like the author of this book will reach at wrong conclusion if he takes a hadith and tries to understand it without getting the background information or the information about when and how the order was withdrawn or replaced by the prophet.
1,The buzzword buzzword handbook,"As a person practicing and researching usability, I was interested to see what can be written about this challenging subject.In the index of the book, you can find chapters suchs as: Cell-Phone-Class Devices; the physcal layer, the logical layer, the cognitive layer etc. The same goes for PDAs, pager-based systems and so on. It seems very interesting...... until you read the text. For example, the book tells us that the Cell-phone class device has a logical layer that ""is really a tiny PC, with small amounts of 'main' memory..."" This is so rude, oversimplified metaphor, that it is more misleading than anything else! This book is full of such oversimplified descriptions or lists of obviousnesses.Big disappointment."
1,Long-waited & deeply disappointing!!,"What a waste of time and money to have this book! No more needs to be said but you are not going to gain anything substantial from this book. If the author's book on the wired web usability has some value, this on is just a collection of obsolete whitepapers and heuristic principles.Don't buy it if you can resist the title."
3,"cute, but....","the heroine was whinny and the hero just needed help, however, the story was cute and itw is worth reading"
3,It's Not a Bad Story... But,"This isn't a bad story, pretty good as far as the ""Franklin First Readers"" go. Franklin finds a special way to share with his friends a book that they all want to read. The dialogue is just right for the intended audience, although still not really true to the normal ""Franklin"" form.The story is okay, but unfortunately, this is another story that has been heavily edited from the original script that aired on television. The original television story was a very good story about taking the time to really enjoy reading and it's not fair to take a completely different story and pass it off as ""Franklin's Reading Club."""
3,General Information - There are Better Choices.,"This book, by Ron Carson and Steve Sanduski, provides the reader with a very general, but holistic view of building a multi-million dollar financial services practice. Beginning iwth a process of ""blueprinting"", where they have the reader examine their values, objectives, passions and motivations, through a series of implementation steps - including hiring, creating systems, branding, organization, marketing and personal health, the book covers the landscape at a 30,000 foot view in some cases, and buzzes through the weeds in others.In comparison to some other books, like those by David Mullen on the same topic, the book strikes me as less actionable, less specific, more fuzzy and less useful. While not a bad read, and you certainly will glean some interesting tidbits from it, there are better choices out there.If this is the topic you want to explore, look to Mullen's books first, and maybe then this as a suppliment."
1,This captures what is wrong with this industry,"This book could be ""A 9-Step Plan for Building and Sustaining a Million Dollar [insert name of industry here] Practice"". It doesn't really talk of how to become a better financial advisor - just a financial advisor who is happy and who makes nice with clients.This book could have been written by PT Barnum.Where do I get the three hours of my life back that it took for me to read this?"
3,PICK OR SHOVEL.,"I read this book thirty years ago, I picked it up because I am a C. S. FORESTER fan. The book is unusual because it is very interesting for the first one third of the book. However it was close to boring to the end of the story.The HAWK is an adventurer operating in S.America he is capturedin CHILE and imprisoned there. His story and comments while in a brutal Chilean prison hold your interest throughout this part.However the remainder of the book which is about his daughtertends to be slow moving."
5,Best Fun Western since Blazing Saddles,"I've always enjoyed Jackie Chan movies, but adding Owen Wilson to the mix gives you a whole new experience! His laid back style and dry humor keep you glued to the screen waiting on his next quip.I'll definitely be adding this title to my DVD collection!"
5,SHANGHAI NOON - an oldie but goodie,"Grandsons - 12, 11, & 9 get a hoot out of the humor in this movie as well as appreciate the solid martial arts. even though it is rated PG-13, the movie is tame by today's comparisons. Thank you Jackie and Owen for 2 hours of pure pleasure."
4,shanghi noon,I think that the advertisement correctly stated the condition of the product. The video was delivered before the stated time which I enjoyed.I also enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to my friends.
5,Hilarious and great fun,"Shanghai Noon is the latest Jackie Chan flick where East meets West. Jackie Chan plays a loyal servant that goes over to America to rescue the princess. However, there are many obstacles in the way including Native Americans, Cowboys and other bad dudes. Of course, since Jackie Chan is in it you are sure to see some brilliant and hilarious fight scenes which are excellently choreographed. His partner (the Robert Redford lookalike) also contributes to the comedy and makes this an overall brilliant product that is worth purchasing. Don't forget the outtakes as well which are just as funny. Another bonus is that it isn't dubbed which makes it far better than other Jackie Chan flicks where there is awful dubbing that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film."
2,Lame excuse for a movie!,"Sorry! But I remember having seen this movie in the theater and was bored, bored, bored. Jackie is cutting way down on his action scenes probably due to age. Instead he's now trying more for the comical effect. Unfortunately the script lacks any comical punch. Lots of filler but little else. Owen Wilson is not up to the task either. At least Chris Tucker was funny in Rush Hour but Owen keeps sounding like a ""surfer dude""."
4,"Good Movie, DVD problems","The movie was as good as I remember it in the theatre. I am writing the review to let people know that Touchstone seems to be doing things with their DVDs that I don't necessarily agree with. When you put the DVD into the player the first thing that shows up is the warning that if you make copies, sell them, and get caught you'll go bankrupt from court ligigation with Disney. The second thing on the video is previews. Here is the problem. I couldn't fast forward through them. I had to press the menu button to get past them. While you may think that's fine what's wrong with that. I say what if there were 4 previews and 3 were for bad movies but one was for a movie like ""The Sixth Sense"" you wouldn't want to skip the previews for a movie like that. This DVD doesn't allow you to do that. For that I take a star away from the movie. 4 stars/5"
2,Western ripoff of Rush Hour,"This movie is basically a western setting of Jackie Chans last comedy Rush Hour, and it isn't nearly as funny. The jokes are lame, and Owen Wilson's constant whining voice gets extremely annoying. Sure, it has a couple moment in the film in which I laughed out loud, but as a whole I really didn't like this movie. I don't recommend buying this dvd, even with some of the nice extras included. I would suggest to rent this first, because its usually a hit or a total miss with most of the people who I have talked to."
2,Goofy fun,"This is good, silly entertainment. It's for the days when you don't want to think much about what's going on, and don't want to watch movies where people undress.That's about all, though. Owen Wilson's wide-eyed naivete was over-used, and Chan's athleticism and physical comedy were under-used. The plot was adequate to keep the characters moving and to alternate between bad guys every now and then. Still, it's not the kind of movie that will keep you up late with its deep philosophy - or even with its bad puns.Perhaps the funniest scene is the bathtub drink-off (no nudity, lots of bubbles). On the second thought, maybe it was the bloopers during the final credits.If you're determined to watch something but can't find anything good on, maybe this is what you wanted. Set your expectations properly, and enjoy."
2,So so....,"I had heard alot of great things about this movie before my wife and I rented it; however, I was really disappointed. Some of the jokes are funny and the action scenes are well choreographed, but all in all the story is lacking and the plight of the characters is nonsensical. If you're a Jackie Chan fan, then I'm sure you will enjoy the action.Rather disappointed,Darin"
4,This isn't a kids movie,"So why is it in the 'kids store'? Anyway, It's as good as comedies come with some deeper themes. Owen Wilson plays a cowboy who helps Jackie Chan fit in out west. Everyone who has seen this movie that I know likes Chan the best, but I thought Owen Wilson was funnier. This would be an okay family movie because sexual inuendos aren't thrown in every five minutes."
5,Jackie Chan is the best once again!,"When I heard that this film was being made I thought that it would never work. An eastern/western? No way. Well, not only does the story line play out well but Chan & Wilson work together very well in this buddy picture. The DVD will not disapoint anyone! The extra footage is great. The stunts in this film are top notch and Lucy Lui is a sight for sore eyes. Pick this one up. This Chan film is one of his best and one of my favorites."
3,Some Funny Moments,"I'm not a big martial arts fan. I watched ""Shanghai Noon"" despite the presence of Jackie Chan, hoping to get some good laughs out of it. And I did. There are some funny situations and some funny lines here. Unfortunately, there aren't enough laughs to make it more than ordinary as a comedy. Chan and Owen Wilson work well as a team, and they inject something extra into what is otherwise a rather disjointed story, keeping the whole enterprise from sinking below average. But that still leaves it firmly in the realm of film mrdiocrity. Finally, there are the martial arts sequences. For Jackie Chan's many fans, these may be enough to raise this flick to a level above the ordinary. For me, they were mildly entertaining, if only because that was where all the movie's action took place, but they were too contrived, and they were were repeated too often. For me, this remains an average movie. If you're not a Jackie Chan devotee, I suggest you see this one before you buy it."
5,Great Movie,I've always loved this movie but I lost my original copy so had to buy another. This along with Shanghai Night makes for a great double feature.
1,An awfull film,"The story idea is good and interesting: A young lady, an imperial princess, breaking out of her court protocol prison to seek a new future in the land of the free. Unfortunately the story is practically obliterated by the interminable antics of an overage stuntman and buffoon. I feel for lovely and intriging Lucy Liu in her miseable little subordinatd roll."
5,Shanghai Noon,"If you are a Jackie Chan and also Owen Wilson, these DVD's are a must add to your collection. It is very entertaining and funny"
4,Good clean fun,"Jackie Chan movies will never win an Oscar.Now that we've established our ceiling, let's consider the following characteristics of this movie:Fantastic, ingenious and creative fight scenesClever, witty comic banterA classic milquetoast saves princess story lineA decent, none-too-heavy-handed social commentaryJackie Chan's likable comedy presenceOwen Wilson's acerbic witIt's a good time. A fun movie with plenty of action and romance, and certainly one of Chan's best of the last 5 years."
4,One of Chan's best!,"I've been a long-time fan of Jackie Chan, and have seen many of his Hong Kong and Australian made films. This is certainly one of his funniest, partially thanks to his teaming up with Owen Wilson. Wilson's monotone voice only ads to the comedy, as you really believe his character is being sincere, though naive.It is a great family movie for kids over 10. There is some mild language (probably no worse than most kids hear in school), and a couple of compromising situations."
3,Has its moments.,"SHANGHAI NOON (a take off of 'High Noon' get it?) is a decent comedy that relies more on the charisma of Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan than on any story. It is funnier than I thought it would be for sure, but it's no BLAZING SADDLES. Worth checking out for some good laughs and of course, Jackie Chan's amazing stunts. The DVD itself is quite standard fare. Nothing spectacular."
3,Action sequences trump weak script,"Jackie Chan's movies always seem to pose the same question for me -- do the exhilaratingly well-choreographed action sequences and Chan's uncanny athleticism make up for the constantly weak scripts? In this case, the answer is a grudging yes. Owen Wilson's hilarious portrayal of the ineffectual cowboy who shows the newly arrived Chan the ropes is responsible for nudging the film over the top for me. But if Jackie Chan was a rock musician, I would still be tempted to wait for the Greatest Hits box set."
4,A good and wholly entertaining book....,"The reviewer below misses the thrust of Leslie's argument. Initially, in the first two chapters of the book, he sets out to list ALL of the ways through which society could become extinct (a notion that has not been held in high esteem for policymaking relevance, anyway, in modern society). As such, he does borrow a lot from other authors. And, adding in, his lifting of the mathematical equation suggesting that we are near the end of 'our' time on the Earth makes mathematical sense, even if being totally anthropomorphic.... And the case is made, if you let it be, that we should probably start thinking about how we are going to 'go', and plan thereof....Aside from that, this book is a riot. The first two chapters, though morbid, are a laugh. The book (setting aside the good philosophy) should be read just for the initial paranoia. It's all in good fun...."
2,"tedious rehashing of other's thoughts, bordering on irrel.","Leslie may claim to be a philosopher, but he is an apocolist. He tediously rehashes almost every major thinkers thoughts and ideas concerning the mass destruction of the human race, brushing over many vital subjects, and subjecting the reader to in-depth analysis and over analysis of higholy improbable and highly theoretical situations whihc may or may not ever occurr. Not to mention that he takes as absolute a highly unregarded theory of ones place in time as being critical to how close one is to being in that population which is to be extincted. The title is highly misleading. Borrow it from the library and skim heavily, not too many salient points. For true enlightenment search the bibliography and pull up the origianl works and just cross reference them. This is nothing more than a compilation of other people's thoughts, with rarely one of Leslie's own."
5,Excellent Music!,"This cd really captures the heart of Rich Mullins and the lyrics are as always, very encouraging and truthful. I enjoy this cd and certainly consider it a must in the Rich Mullin's collection."
3,Not bad. Not great. A little tedious,"I know this came out awhile ago, but I'll throw this out there anyway. This isn't bad at all, but it isn't great either. Heavy as all get out, and very tight. It is well done, both the production and the playing. It's just a little tedious. It definitely gets me going at first, but by the end of this album I'm ready to shut it off."
1,400 BLOWS --British 80s hiphop/industrial/experimental act,I don't understand WHY/HOW they would bother taking the name already from a pioneering Brit funk/hiphop/experimental group already long established.
3,malta's role,This is a good historical account of malta during wwII. The author puts himself in the coockpit of several of the airbourne fighters and describes the action. He also puts us in the eyes of som eof the local maltese people. Some of the descriptions of the photos are a little lame sounding 'his eyes betray his depression'--a tad bit too dramatic. overall a good book.
4,My 3 and 5-yr-old daughters both love this!,"Just got several sets of the different outfits for each of my daughters. They each have the doll and the carry case as well. They just love these. Each item is big enough for the littler one to easily fit the outfits onto the doll. The dolls have long hair that can be brushed, and the outfits are very sturdy -- not a broken one yet. They really love this. Glad I got it. The prices are low enough that I'm now buying a doll and an outfit as birthday gifts for my daughters' friends."
5,A powerful album!,"This album is one of the most powerful Christian albums I own. The title track, He Is, Revive Us Again, Power In The Blood. These are all terrific songs. She has a voice that has power and she lets it rip on every track. Purchase this and you will understand what I'm talking about."
2,Not up to Arrow Standards,When chosing this tool I did so contrary to other reviews. I have used Arrow staplers for over 30 years and they have always been very good. The ETFX 50 was the highest priced. I expected more. To the nuts and bolts. The tool is cheaply made and tinny. It jambs regularly. About two jambs per 1 stick of staples. You will need to keep a pair of vice grip pliers available to pull the jambed staples out of the machine. The tool does not drive the staples flush. The Stanley TRE 550 is just as good at a lot less money.
1,Don't waste time or money!,"I tested the stapler with 5 staples when I first received it. A few days later I used it and after only 2 staples it jammed! I could not un-jam the stapler and had to finish the project using my old faithfull manual stapler. And to answer the customer service question here, YES I did use Arrow T50 staples!"
1,Lying manufacturer,"On the box there's a big 14amp sign, but when you look closer, the stapler itself is actually 10amps. Why the trickery? It seems to function alright, but the concept of truth in advertising demands a spanking here.There are other staplers out there that are electric and are much more capable, albeit more expensive, but this one already comes at a premium based on false advertising, so why bother?An update: I've put in over twenty thousand staples for a radiant heat project recently, most with a pneumatic stapler, perhaps 100 with this Arrow stapler. The recoil is annoying, and it lacks power. If I had to have an electric stapler, I'd spend $200 for the Duofast, or some other high end stapler with enough mass to kill the recoil."
1,Thoroughly disappointed.,Jams after 4-5 staples. Haven't gotten through one strip of staples yet. Thoroughly disappointed with this stapler. Am attempting to return it. Wish I'd read reviews first.
1,Broke after 200 staples,"I bought this stapler based on the brand. I have had good experiences with Arrow in the past and my current manual stapler is very solid. I have a bunch of stapling to do, installing insulation in my attic. The stapler worked quite well for the first 200 or so staples, but then quit working. It would actuate, but the hammer wouldn't move. Turns out, the part that connects the electric plunger to the hammer broke. Upon inspection, it doesn't look like a particularly good design (I'm a mechanical engineer). Other users don't seem to have the problem, and I was very impressed with the stapler prior to its demise. Perhaps this was an anomaly.When I called Arrow, I thought they would send out a replacement part and I'd be on my way again fairly quickly. Instead, they told me to contact the seller. I did, and Amazon very quickly sent me an RMA and mailing label. I'm returning the tool and am not going to replace it."
1,I'd rate this bad puppy 0 stars if I could,"It simply doesn't work - right out of the box. I pull the trigger and get a little click, but nothing strong enough to drive a staple. I'm returning this dog and reading the online reviews before I invest in another power stapler."
2,It's OK but I wouldn't recommend it.,"If you have a lot of stapling to do, a manual gun can really start to hurt your hands. I had been using a manual gun, and decided to give this electric one a try. I keep alternating b/n the two, but I think the manual one is easier to use and the staples are much flatter. I think this gun would be great if the part you pressed used your whole hand, like the manual one. Instead, you have to press the gun with only 2 fingers and it's pretty tough, especially after you've been doing it a while. I would not recommend this product."
2,junk,"Have been thru 4 of these doing insulation in my attic over the past 2 1/2 years. Unfortunately, I always seem to misplace the receipt so i cannot return it. None were bought thru Amazon. Only reason I buy it is because it's all Ive found locally that will fit where I need it to. I had an Arrow mechanical stapler for 30 years before it gave out. Thought Arrow stood for quality, but I was wrong."
1,Weak Jam-O-Matic,"Constantly jams, weak. I have one of the spring hand powered staplers that is stronger. This thing might be ok for stapling cheesecloth to cardboard, if you don't mind the constant jams. From my experience, pneumatic Surebonder 9600 is the way to go. I have a Hitachi pneumatic construction stapler for the big stuff, that is also fantastic."
1,Constantly Jams,"I was very disappointed with this stapler. Jams constantly and difficult to unjam. One day I had to unjam after every staple, with no evidence of any problems. Staple loading system is very cumbersome compared to my old Stanley, which had a simple flip out bottom for loading. Avoid."
1,"Poor performer, Poor quality",I purchased this primarily to use while installing insulation. It never drove the staples consistently. There is no depth adjustment. And it failed after only a dozen rolls of insulation were installed.I highly recommend that you do NOT purchase this item.
2,This staple gun is not heavy duty.,"This staple gun could not even put staples through a thin sheet of OSB. Whenever I tried to put the staples through the ceiling tiles and OSB the staples would just bend and hardly penetrate the OSB. The staples went through the ceiling tiles okay, but they were made from a very soft material. When I tried using the gun on the plain OSB they hardly penetrated and bent. There is nothing heavy duty about this thing."
1,Horrible horrible horrible!,"Heavy-duty my a**. This stapler won't drive through 1/8"" tempered hardboard (MDF, basically), and even in plywood about 50% of the staples are crooked or bent over. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Reliability Problems,"I was looking for an automatic stapler to upholster kitchen chairs. The arrow website directed me to this model. I was using 3/8"" staples and the stapler stopped working after two rows of staples. Amazon did a great job replacing it with a new one. I reduced the staple to a 1/4"" (not happy I had to do this) in an attempt to put less strain on the stapler. It works better but I have had to totally disassemble the thing when it jams which is often. This is not an acceptable stapler for upholstering. It may be fine driving into pine such as installing insulation. Besides the jamming many staples do not drive straight in and are in effective in holding material in place. I have gotten used to removing these staples and redoing it until I get one to drive in straight.I should have purchased a pneumatic stapler."
1,Do not buy this stapler,"The stapler quit working after less than 500 staples. I took it apart and I think something on the circuit board failed. I can hear the micro-switch clicking but nothing happens. Prior to the total failure the stapler was jamming frequently. I was using Arrow T-50 5/16"" staples."
1,stops working,"I bought this stapler and was happy at first. Then, as with another review, it just stopped working. I was working in my crawl space and having to get into difficult positions, pull the trigger and then. . . nothing, nothing. Would work and then, not work. Took it back and exchanged it. New one, same thing. Buy it if you like to pull triggers with no effect. If you need to get something done look for something else."
1,Couldn't even get through two small boxes of staples!,I purhcased this to staple chicken wire to a cage I was building and it couldn't even make it through a couple of boxes of staples. I'm sitting here looking at a job that should have been done hours ago but after repeated jams the stapler finally got to the point where it was jamming more than working. I gave up on it. Look elsewhere!
1,ETFX50 Jams a Lot,"I purchased this staple gun at my local Lowes. Arrow has been around for a long long time. I thought I couldn't go wrong with that name. Wrong. For every 8 or 10 good shots it would jam. Worse, there is no EASY way to clear the jam. I understand it can be taken apart but not quickly or easily. But you shouldn't have to. My theory is that the impact from each shot breaks apart the glued together line of staples in the magazine and then they get whopperjawed and cause a jam. When holding a line of staples in your hand, you have to be very careful to not break them.I would not recommend this staple gun to anyone."
2,Patience required,"I bought this stapler to save on time and fatigue for a canvas project requiring 300 staples.A stapler is such a simple product that it either works or it doesn't. In this case the ETFX50 doesn't work well enough to warrant replacing a manual T50 stapler.Cons:- jams too often and you fight to open the staple pusher assembly- trigger lacks positive feel- cannot fire staples quickly, during ""recharge phase"" trigger does nothing- sharp edged trigger lock rubs against your thumb- cord is too heavy as others have commented- worst of all, with all this power 10A+, staples still don't sit flush"
1,Wish I could find the box to return it!,"I was so excited to get this stapler, the one we had before was having difficulty piercing the ply wood. I was planning on using this stapler for upholstering some simple projects. However the Arrow stapler does not agree with that and jams every other staple! So, frustrating! I will not be buying this brand ever again. I agree with another unsatisfied customer, if I could give it 0 stars I would."
4,They're ADORABLE!!!,"first of all.. they're 100% cotton, so it can be immedietly assumed that these undies are comfy! not to mention each day of the week affords a member of your favorite gang!! personally, i think linus with his blanket is the best. i definently recommend these for the many fans of Charlie Brown and the rest... the only down-side is the price... but for some of us.. if just doesnt matter ;)"
5,"I liked the music, And i'm going to buy.","I also love Loretta Lynn's songs, so tell her to keep it up"
4,A pretty guide to diary keeping.,I've read through all of the pages and written in quite a few. I would haven given 5 stars but some of the things (like top 5 favorite millionares to date ...or something like that) didnt relate.A colorful and girly diary that is fun to fill out.
3,Take it for what it is....,"Take it for what it is... It is meant to be cute, non- serious, and playful. It is simply meant to be light hearted, and fun. People who are so harsh about it obviously were looking for something far more than it is. Enjoy it! Every girl is a princess and should be reminded of that. =)"
3,Just because...,"Just because you don't like Paris Hilton as a person doesn't mean you should under-rate her diary. I am not saying I'm a huge fan... but what you all should be rating here is her diary... NOT HERSELF! So, get a grip and behave yourselves.I would have to say that this diary is a great outlet for teens to express themselves and feel fantastic about themselves. My only problem was that instead of photos of Paris, it should use the space for pictures of the user's self.This all being said, I would reccomend it for a teen girl who loves to talk, shop, or just loves Paris Hilton. I would have to say a no to any guys... this wouldn't be the right gift."
1,Give Me A Break!!,"Why is this woman a star? Has our mental capacity seriously dropped this low in society that Paris Hilton not only got one book deal but two? And possibly more who knows? This is the message we're sending girls? Be a shallow air head like Paris? I have never met Paris. I don't need to. They say ""Oh this is just the image she puts out to the public eye, she's not really like this all the time"" Well then what the hell?? Shouldn't she be putting out her so called ""real image"" then? Is this what we think is ok? Be shallow and fake and stupid and people will love you. But don't show the real you, cause you'll go nowhere. This is stupid. Girls if you want to write in a Diary then buy a DIARY! Not one with Paris's face on it. A real diary. Write down your thoughts and feelings and not crap like ""I love this store and that store and these shoes and that purse!"" blah blah blah. She's an idiot and she needs to grow up."
5,A DARLING IDEA FOR AGIFT,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE ""DIARY"" IDEA TO GO ALONG WITH PARIS'S OTHER BOOK, ""CONFESSIONS OF AN HEIRESS"". THEY ARE BOTH CLEVER AND ARE PERFECT FOR THE ""GIRLY"" TYPE OF FEMALE. IT IS HARDBOUND AND PINK AND ALONG WITH SPACE TO WRITE DOWN YOUR OWN THOUGHTS,PARIS GIVES HELPFUL HINTS ALL THRU THE BOOK.SHE STRESSES ALL THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT BEING A YOUNG WOMAN THAT WE CAN OFTEN FORGET ALONG THE WAY.SHE OFFERS TIPS IN THE BEAUTY AREA,AS IN ""HAIR DO'S"" AND ""HAIR DONTS."" SHE GIVES GREAT ""BOY"" ADVICE AND THINGS THAT TEENAGE GIRLS ARE BEGGING TO UNDERSTAND. AS I TOLD MY FRIEND THE OTHER DAY,I AM AN ADULT AND I FIND MYSELF JOURNALING IN IT NIGHTLY!I HOPE THIS HELPS. ALSO, AS FAR AS DEALING WITH AMAZON AND THEIR AFFILIATE(S) I FOUND IT TO BE AN EASY AND PLEASANT TRANSACTION AND I PLAN ON ORDERING MORE FROM THEIR SIGHT. SINCERELY, PIA"
1,Good in Parts,"Before the wood-chippers and pandering, predatory publishers moved in, 'Your Heiress Diary: Confess It All to Me' was once a small forest somewhere, sunlit and breeze-licked by day, starlit and silent at night. It's becoming increasingly difficult to maintain a sense of optimism.However, for the sake of balanced criticism, it is important to cite the book's eloquently redeeming features... the small blank spaces between the words."
2,Disappointed....,"I have to say that i'm very disappointed about this book, even though i'm a Paris Hilton fan. I ordered this book directly from amazon.com that i didn't have a chance to what's it like insaide. When i received the copy, i was extremely disappointed! I thought this was PARIS' diary, but it turned out it's not, in fact, you actually need to write stuff yourself. There's a title in every page and guiding you how to write. It's just kinda boring..... The 2 stars that i gave to this book is due to those gorgous pictures inside the book!!"
5,"For Any ""Celebrity/Socialite/Pop Star/Actress in Training""","I'm writing a review that will -suprise!- PRAISE this book. I'm a 15 year old girl who happens to be a FUTURE POP CULTURE PHENOMENON. This book will give any ""celeb in training"" a special place to record EVERY DETAIL of your dream celebrity life!PS: I'm a huge Paris Hilton fan; regardless of what people think of her!"
3,"i like Paris a lot, but not her stupid ""norms""...","I do think that Paris is a super hot heiress, (well, come on, its very hard not to look like a princess / a hottie when you are that loaded!!) and i especially adore the fact that she loves animals.however, i really think she and her family and freinds should stop calling their pets ""the hottest Accessory""!!! is like the pets are toys and have no lives!!!You can certainly make a pet a part of your family but its a complete brain-wash idea for those heiress followers/fans to get a little animal as accessory!!!... those Chihuahua which were returned after certain time would be put down, we are creating and killing a scary figure of them these days...stop the madness guys!!Paris, if you really loves animal, stop encouraging those brainless to get an animal/a life for them to look cool!!!!!! start doing things for good course!"
1,I don't know why I even have to say this but...,"Ok the book was bad enough, but now we have a diary featureing advice from someone who probably thinks that the entire universe literally revolves around her continued existance. Someone whose ego is so big that a black hole would get sucked into it. I could go on but I won't. Is it possible that there are *Gasp* flaws in people! I doubt she would actually realize this. Well actually with her it's more like there are flaws herself, and that everone else is just a walking flaw. I'll admit it, I've got my fair share of flaws. For one I'm overly cynical and sarcastic. For two I have waaaay too much free time. As shown by the fact that I wrote this much about a book with no content."
2,Two stars is generous,"What a dramatic decline for a band that was once so great. Express is sublime throughout. Seventh Dream has its great moments, despite the awkward Christian lyrics. The single is really the only thing on this album worth listening to, and it's weaker than anything on Express."
2,A boring book wiwth one brilliant insight.,"What can I say? I was very disappointed in the main part of the book. I had read it before, 75 years ago when I was 14, and found it very interesting on precognitive dreams. This second time of reading I realized that only one small section of the book is really about that type of dream, the rest is Dunne's own idiosyncratic rendering of an obscure, impossible to grasp, theory about time. It reads like a badly written engineering manual for deaf-mutes. I wanted the book for a collector's item and for reference in an article I have written on precognitive dream theory. As such it was worth the $70 to me."
4,Fascinating old book with a surprisingly modern theory,"This book, first published early 20th century, has an intriguing theory regarding life, death, dreams and prediction of the future. Although antiquated in style, the idea is still fresh and original. You can try the 'experiment' yourself and sometimes it works. Worth seeking out if you are interested in the philosophy of what is life, death and what are we doing here. Was republished in paperback in UK in the 50's. I lent my copy to many people many who had no previous interest in the subject but then found it quite fascinating - unfortunately someone didn't return it to me!"
5,continuing the greatness,this volume is alot more interesting then volume 6. the main story here is how suzu has come across the long lost Asano and the two of them meet a boy who ends up being killed by a man named shoko. it ends on a cliff hanger with asano pointing his new found gun on the evil man. this volume also adds to youko and shoukei's story.
1,Very poor tires,"On my 3rd day out using these tires, I got a flat already. It wasn't glass or nails, it was a small little rock. Don't waste your money."
1,Wretched rings of failure,"I forgot that I'd had these horrendous things on my hybrid commuter bike years ago and bought a set for my road bike. I get a flat about once a week, and it's usually caused by some tiny shard of metal or glass that should've never made it through the casing. I'm not that fat (~166 lbs) and ride on decent roads. Michelin Pro2Races had much better puncture resistance than these. If you're on a budget, just buy a better tire - you'll save money by not having to constantly replace tubes. If you need a good, cheap, bulletproof tire, get Michelin Krylion Carbons instead."
1,"Terrible Tires, Do Not Buy","Absolutely the worse tires ever. I have been cycling a long time and fixed more flats than I care to count. These cheap tires came on my 2008 Bianchi (I can't imagine why?) and I just assumed they were decent, but then I had a flat.Whatever you do, don't leave home without tire levers because there is no way you are getting these wire rimmed things off without them. Then, if you are lucky enough to get it back on, be sure to ride directly to the LBS since using the tire levers likely ripped the sidewall.Take it from me, by Michelin or Vittoria, you can't go wrong. Steer clear of these..."
1,Don't Do It...,"Bought these to replace a set of fantastic Conti Sport Contacts 700x32 with a skinnier tire 700x23 -- bad mistake!>1 year and ~4500 miles on Sport Contacts = 1 Flat<1 month and ~350 miles on Ultra Sports = 5 FlatsSwitched to Michelin Krylion Carbons, much better tires in the 700x23 size."
1,Continental Ultra Flats,"I'm a regular bike commuter. Usually about 30-50 miles a week.I purchased these tires after my old tires had about 2500 miles on them. These Continentals both flatted within two weeks. At first, I thought it was a fluke, but upon inspection I realized both tires had been punctured all the way through!That is crazy, because normally I might expect to see a glass shard or something that barely got through, but never a hole in the actual tire. These are a waste of money and I've already almost broke even on buying tubes.The next time these flat, which will probably be this week, I'm replacing with the Gator Skins. I highly recommend avoiding these tires."
5,Great tire; great price.,"I'm not sure what kind of roads the previous reviewer rides on or if the fault is with his tubes, but I've been running this tire for two years now with great results. Only one flat has happened the whole time and that was a ""goatshead"" thorn I picked up on a trail that would've flattened pretty much any tire. I highly recommend this tire for economy and overall performance."
1,Should be called Ultra Flats,I have had my new Fuji (shame on them for putting these tires on the bike) for all of 7 days and have had a flat on every other ride for a total of 4. I have been riding theses same roads for years without a flat on my other bikes.
2,Not so awesome,"I only have a few hundred miles on these tires and they developed a bubble, a ring of split rubber, a few flats.I'm very observant of where I ride and avoid any thing that would dan madge the tire. I normally ride the conti Gator skin but wanted to try these cheaper tires. I will be buying some gatorskins not the ultra sport."
2,Average review for average tires,"These are very common tires to get as standard equipment on entry-level carbon road-bikes. The reason for that is how cheaply Continental sells them to the bike manufacturers. The name on these tires over-promises, and their performance under delivers. Had 2 tires (both my front and real) wear their tread out in ~600 miles of riding. Granted, Boston roads are by no means the best in the world, but even really bad tires should last longer than that. Decided to replace them when I could see deformations in them as if they were going to have blow-outs. Strange because I don't think I've ever locked up my brakes on these tires so I don't think they should have had any abuse to give them flat spots and cause this deformation.I'd spend my money elsewhere."
1,Do not be fooled!!!,"If you are looking for Caifanes the band this is not it!!!This is a real piece of s*%#. It's fake and unreslistic, part of Mexico's vault of shame. I know my country has put out some very great films but this is deffinately not one of them."
2,disappointing,"There may be a few good principles here but they were lost on me, amidst the overwhelming ostentatiousness of the houses. Do they think the only people who read design books are multi-millionaires? The houses lacked the very thing they were going for - a sense of home-iness."
5,Great place to start!,This is a great overview for learning the basic principles of home design. We were able to look back at the various places we lived and understand why we loved or hated certain elements which gives us a better understanding of what to aim for in our next house.
3,Seen it before,"I'm seeing again some of the architect-designed houses featured in other Taunton Press books, here assembled under another pretext: timeless design.... Their succesful formula: some catchy premise (Not So Big, etc.) to serve as a backdrop for the true heart of the book--the pictures. As always, expensive, contemporary designs carefully and beautifully photographed, all intended to satisfy readers' endless appetites for novelty in their escapist fantasies involving houses and furniture.On the other hand, it's very reasonably priced :-)"
5,Great Patterns that Fit with Subjective Experience of Home,I first got this book when checking out a bunch of books on home design from the library. This one really spoke to me and stood out from the crowd. I ended up buying one copy for friends who are building a house and one for me... because SOMEDAY I am going to build my house... and just has good ways to think about what I want to do with the house I'm in and what I'd look for both as existing features and potential features of a new home. Concrete ways to think about how to create a home that feels like home.
4,Patterns of Home,"Classic book on new home design. A must for new home builders. It explains why some home just ""feel right"" and makes you wnat to visit or live there.Some basic advise on home placement relative to the sun. Energy savings with functionality and visual appeal. A must read for any one considering building a custom home."
2,disappointing,"Having bought and read the original book ""A Pattern Language"" I was most interested to get this book. However I found it quite confusing and would imagine anyone who had not read the first book wouldn't have a clue what it was about. I would reccomend the first book and then if you wanted further information buy some of Sarah Susanka's excellent books which are available..."
3,Extremely disappointing,"Two typos on the introductory page largely put me off. Such sloppiness is grave warning that the book itself is very likely a hasty and slapdash effort.In that expectation alone I was not disappointed. What the author says is true. The techniques he describes for free writing are helpful. (Thus the three stars.) But in communicating the technique, he seems to have taken the worst elements of self-help guides, how-to books and management gurus, and not added any original thought.The book can be read in one sitting with ease, and for the most part, it reads as if it was written in one sitting. There are many good books about the creative process and writing. I would steer potential readers away from this one."
4,Great photos and interesting writing,"I found this book at the Indianapolis Institute of Arts. The author does a fine job of surveying Gehry's career and accomplishments. The reader is also offered some additional GENERAL information on various influencing architects, and architectual syles and/or movements. While the text is concise, it is truly unpretentious. The photographs are splendid, especially those showing his masterpiece, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. While this is not a full treatise on the works and influence of Gehry's career, it is exactly as the title suggests: it offers the essentials of Gehry's artistry and mastery."
1,cant see the track titles,This isn't a review - I just want to tell you that I can't tell what is on the CD when you only list 1 track !!Chris
5,"Aerobics for your head, less ideological than one expects.","Upon first reading, skepticism looms overhead, fat black rainclouds of doubt shadow the land. The ray of sun is: that no single opinion dominates this book, that it is refreshingly diverse. Anarchists in this volume emerge as political freethinkers, people of a courageous honesty who debate and exchange powerful ideas on the topics concerning social beings. When closing the book, wonder is in the wind...one ponders Mencken's germane analogy of politics to religion and the poplular participation of the masses in the exercise of control."
1,nothing novel in this novel,"Why would anyone want to read Shadow Box by Antonia Logue? Eighty per-cent of the source material is much more eloquently presented in Carolyn Burke's earlier biography of Mina Loy, Becoming Modern. Logue's novel seems to me to be transparent borrowing from someone else's work. It's as though she took the same deck of cards, blithely re-arranged them, and called it an original work of art. For further corroboration of this point of view, please refer to the Toronto Globe and Mail's review of Oct. 9, 1999."
1,"A good read, but...","Mina Loy lead a fascinating, adventurous life. That this novel captures much of it in such rich, well-researched detail is due, however, not to the meticulous research of Logue, but to the scholar who wrote the biography upon which the novel is based. Shadow-Box is good because it is a novelization (unauthorized) of Carolyn Burke's Becoming Modern. Why not read the original?"
1,Cribbing from Carolyn Burke,"As Emily Barton wrote in the NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW (Nov 14, 1999, p. 25), Logue's book appears to be ""cribbed from Carolyn Burke's recent biography of Loy."" And one should add that Roger Conover's writings about Arthur Cravan, which Logue seems to have used, are totally unacknowledged by Logue."
3,"Thsi is a kids book, I was fooled.",I read the book in about 10 minutes. It is a book that you would find in the children's section of a library. I was looking for authentic cooking and this has ideas but modern techniques. If you are a kid doing some research on early settlers and some of the food this would be great. If you were like me and thought it was going to be some history of cooking stay away.
2,Dissapointed for what I thought I was getting,"When I first looked at this book at the bookstore I thought, Great,,my son has ADHD and was looking for a change in his diet to help. However the book just barely skims any one topic with a paragraph or two if you're lucky on anyone subject and has no depth to it at all. If you're just looking for the tip of the iceburg this is it. There is nothing more than an overview to any subject when it comes to amounts, dosages for supplements or nutrients and the amount needed. About half way through I quit reading it since it was of no help other than a broad spectrum overview. The Myth of Learning Disabilities..etc..by Robin Pauc I think, was much better at first glance and actually had dosages for supplements to know where to start and why this or that would help brain function etc. Hope this helps."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,Great Product - ordering this slip was worth the money mostly because it was a big time saver!! It will get multiple uses. Fast Shipping along with the BEST Customer Service I have seen in years! Thanks Viv!!
4,Poodle crinoline,the Poodle Crinoline was perfect. Not to scratchy and very true to size. It made the poodle skirt look great.Hey Viv! Adult Sz: Poodle Skirt Crinoline SlipWas a great buy compared to other internet sites. Thank You Dale Chalmers
1,Cheap - provides no fullness,I bought this crinoline to go under a tea length 50's style dress. I was hoping it would provide enough fullness - to make it look like a poodle skirt. It did not even come close. It is super cheap and has absolutely no fullness. There literally is no noticable difference from when I have teh crinoline underneath and when i don't. The other review said he would not pay more than $15 - I would not pay more than $7. I am back to looking for another crinoline.
4,Decent Quality Hardware - Recommended,"This Clevis Pin Assortment has a nice range of single hole Clevis Pins that are handy for the odd repair or project. We needed two of the pins from this set for a project in my wife's shop and decided to order the assortment so we would have extras on hand the next time we need them.These are good enough quality but come somewhat greasy. The six compartment plastic container is convenient but nothing special and there is an insert that indicates the sizes contained in each slot.These worked well for my needs, recommended!CFH"
4,OK,The checkbook package was opened. No pieces were missing. But It was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a Christmas gift.
5,Looks like an actual checkbook.,It was my daughter's favorite gift. It was probably the least expensiveof all her gifts. She loves to pretend play...
3,Disappointed,"When my teenage children were younger I bought them pretend checkbooks by ParentBanc and used them for their allowance. Now that my other two are ages 7 and 10, I wanted to do the same with them, to teach them the concept of checks and help them learn to manage their money. I have not been able to find the ParentBanc checks, but I did find this set, which looked to be really nice, so I ordered them (although I feel they are overpriced). I was disappointed to find that the check register is simply two connected sheets printed on front and back, the checkbook doesn't have a cardboard backing to slide into the checkbook cover. I guess my expectations were high because the ParentBanc brand was so much nicer and more like the real deal. Also, I ordered two sets and the pen doesn't work in either set. I gave my kids a real check register and another pen, so these serve the purpose for their allowance, but for $15 per set, I really expected better."
1,Wow. I shouldn't have ignored previous reviews!,"This product is...excuse my language...crap! It really does look like I bought it from the local dollar shop. I still think my 7 year old niece will like it but wow.....I paid $18 for THIS! It really is just printed paper, not checkbook quality. For $18, you seriously are better off downloading a free check template online and printing on a color printer. Grab an old check registry (we all have one), and a cheap calculator from th $1 shop."
1,DO NOT EVER BUY THIS BATTERY,"I ignored the other guy's review about it getting stuck and bought it anyway. It immediately got stuck in my brand new Canon XH A1. It was lodged so tightly that you couldn't even get a tool around the sides of it. I finally got it out by tilting the camera all the way back on the tripod so that the battery door opened to the floor. I then took a vacuum cleaner hose and taped it around the battery to make it airtight, turned it on, and sucked the battery out of the camera. It was crazy. PLEASE spend more and get a battery that fits. Google this battery and you'll see it is a problem."
4,Canon Battery Charger,This item shipped quickly and works well. On the whole I am satisified with the service etc.
1,Broken,I received the charger and the light indicator was broken where you cannot tell if its charging if plugged in. Useless
4,Does the job!,"As other reviewers have stated, if you are sick of looking for the charger that came with your camera, this is just what you want. It charges the battery and is compact. What more could you ask for?"
4,Works Great,Folding plug is handy for travel. Got this as a replacement for the one that came with the camera which got left behind on the last vacation.Works Great.
4,"Charges quickly, shipped quickly.","This Canon CB-2LV battery charger is almost identical to the one I originally recieved from the manufacturer. It feels a little lighter, so maybe the plastic isn't quite the same. Otherwise, it serves its purpose, charges quickly, and came in 2-3 days. Can't beat that!"
3,Canon Battery Charger,"this product was supposed to be cordless. instead I received one with a cord.It does the job, but not as described."
5,Canon Battery Charger,I purchased this to replace one that had been lost. Paid less than what I would pay in local stores for the same problem. No complaints.
3,"Works, but not an authentic Canon product.","Bought this product to charge my Canon NB-4L batteries after I lost the original charger. This product did charge the battery, but buyers should know that this is not an authentic Canon product. Despite having the Canon logo, but it's definitely not of authentic Canon quality. It's made with cheap plastic and charging time seems to be longer."
4,Battery Charger Review,"Product arrived on-time and works EXACTLY like the original one that came with my camera before I lost it. Good purchase, making my camera usable again."
5,Fast Shipment- Works,The battery arrived very quickly. It was neatly packaged and works well.Not much else to report. The item was fairly priced also.
5,Nice replacement,Unfortunately I lost my original charger and had to replace it. Shipping with Amazon was quick and predictable as always. Product arrived timely and works fine.
5,Canon CB-2LV Battery Charger,"My husband and I left behind the battery charger for our Canon Powershot SD400 on our recent trip to Mexico... this one replaced our original... it is more compact and works great! Now, we will be more careful on our future trips."
1,Have never received this product despite telephone calls and e-mails to Amazon,I wish there was a zero-star option but I had to give this a 1-star rating. I can't review this product ordered almost six weeks ago because I have not received it! It was not the box with my other item and I have had no response to my inquiries as to it's whereabouts. I have not received the credit I asked for either. Very disappointing.
1,Third party chargers on ebay for much less.,"I bought a third party charger on ebay for 2.50, it works just as well as my canon charger did before I lost it and is approximately the same size and weight. Canon does not have a monopoly on this product so they shouldn't charge monopolistic prices."
1,Amazon comes to the rescue,We lost the recharger to our camera. It is still lost. We ordered one through Amazon.com which came quickly enough for us to use the camera on vacation!
5,No complaints,It works like it's supposed to and I got it on time. What more can you ask for. I'm happy.
5,mark sargent,"i went all over the place looking for an affordable battery for my camera. i then went online and found the battery i was looking for and at a far better price. i""m on a fixed income and i have to bargain shop. thank you for the excellent customer service and making me a happy customer. :) :)"
5,Exactly what you'd expect,"This is the same charger that comes bundled with the camera, but I needed a replacement after mine was stolen. It's a pretty simple device that does what you expect it to: it charges quickly and consistently. I've used it with Canon brand batteries and an off-brand battery, and it works equally well. The plug on the back is hinged so that it can fold in, which makes the charger even more compact."
4,Canon CB-2LV battery charger,"On the way back from my last vacations in Southern California, I misplaced this Canon battery charger. Instead of turning my house upside down to find it (credit card size), I figured it would be faster and easier for my nerves to purchase another one. I am glad to find a decent deal through Amazon.This compact and slim design is excellent for frequent travellers."
4,Canon CB-2LV Battery Charger,This is an excellent item small easy to carry and store and does the job required
1,Never arrived!!!,I have still not gotten the product and the UPS shipment tracking says it is in Phoenix. How do I get some help to deliver it again???
1,Canon CB-2LV Batter Charger NEVER RECEIVED,"I was charged for this product and provided a tracking number that says it was delivered but I never received it. The company that shipped the product said they would ""Open an investigation"" and let me know within 7 days what they found out. It has been almost a month and I have heard nothing. I will never order from them again."
1,Ripoff,"I lost my battery charger to my canon camera. Amazon had the lowest price, yet I still think they rip you off. I can't use my camera without it."
1,Looking for my order,"I ordered this battery 2 weeks ago, until now it did not arrive. Please contact me back asap.Thanks"
1,ok,"It's small size and easy to take with you to charge the battery. However, I didn't realize it already came with the camera package, so lost money for s/h to return it."
4,Lightweight,"I lost my original charger and decided to get this one again. It is lightweight, portable, and easy to operate."
5,Great little charger,I was surprised by the size of the charger. It is really small and great for travel. I would recommend that charger to anyone who has a canon camera.
1,What a waste of money,"The hard thing about buying anything online and used is that you cannot see the product before you buy it. And the pictures can be misleading. We bought this charger, but it quite frankly does not work. We ended up going to another store to buy another one. It was all a frustrating process."
5,great travel charger,"I bought my canon camer overseas, so I needed to get a charger that worked in US 110 volt outlets. This came very quickly and work great. Instead of a cord it has the prongs that swing out of the back of the casing and plugs right into the wall. Charged my battery from dead to full in a little more than an hour."
5,Canon Camera Charger,"Product was just what we expected. More than half the price than if you buy if from Canon directly. Works great, Fast shipping. Thanks"
3,Missing information,"It would have been nice to know that this charger comes with a cord. The charger to our one- year old Cannon camera is MIA at the moment, but we are hoping it will turn up. In the meantime, we ordered this one. The price is substantially less than those shown elsewhere. The misplaced charger plugged directly into the outlet with prongs that folded into the back of the unit. The picture of the replacement charger we ordered made it appear to work the same way. Not so. It does not have the self-storing prongs; it requires a thick cord which makes it much less handy to carry with the camera. The search for the lost charger has intensified!"
5,Best battery charger,"This is the best type of charger. It is compact, easy to carry and easy to use."
3,Canon Battery charger,"I am satisfied however I did not know the replacement charger I had ordered included a power cord attachment. My original charger plugged directly into the wall from the unit. Otherwise, so far it is a good charger."
2,$40 for something that cost $3,$40 for something that cost $3 to produce? Just another way companies make money by selling a product cheap and then charing ridiculous prices for all the accessories. Marketing at its best.
3,help,Does this charger work for the Canon 1100 IS? I have been looking and I cannot tell if it does or not. I looked at the battery and it did not say anything about having CB 2L but it does say its a NB 4L.
2,Canon Battery Charger,The product is perfect. The company which I purchased the battery charger from is far from perfect. I paid extra for expedited shipping and it still took more than 3 weeks to receive the item.
4,camera charger for sd630 cannon,"This is a good product, I put my order and the merchandise arrived in 5days."
5,"Works great, cheap price","We lost ours that came with the camera. So I went to the several websites and most wanted around 50 bucks for the sucker! Found it on Amazon for a total around 15 bucks after shipping. It is working great, glad I was able to purchase it and received it right before the holidays."
2,Cheap Clone,"I purchased through Savings 365 (aka ANS DIGITAL CORP), but fulfilled by Amazon. This is a cheap clone, for the following reasons:* No security screw (just two standard Phillips screws)* Loose battery pocketing* Wimpy battery contacts (thin wire)* Cheap molding* Packed in a plain white box with a sticky label for IDYou pay for what you get. I would not leave it unattended while charging. If I hadn't found my OEM charger I would have checked the voltages during a charge, but at this point it is not worth the effort."
2,Shameful pass off...,"I bought this as a replacement as I had lost ours on a vacation to England.Pros:I must say it did arrive very quickly.It did ""work"" technically.The packaging was minimal which I like.Cons:It arrived smelling a little funky - like burning plasticIt had marks (scuffs) on the main face in 3 areasWhen I plugged it in and left it for 30 mins (kept an eye on it due to funky smell) I took it out and the smell had become a burning one. Immediately unplugged and packaged to return tomorrow.I am all about reviewing the actual product and only ever give 1 star for service (unless it's absolutely atrocious), but in this case I cannot really review a faulty item and it lost two stars for trying to pass off a very obviously second-hand, faulty piece of equipment.When I get my replacement, if satisfactory, I will adjust my rating and review at that time."
1,Did not work out of the box!,"opened up the box and plugged it in and it made a loud crackling sound constantly, then after a minute it stopped never charged the battery. Sent it back! If I'm going to pay for this charger, battery and shipping for 50 dollars, I may as well buy a new camera. Which is what I'm going to do and get everthing in one box new and up to date!"
4,Canon CB-2LV,"Pros: It works great. Does the job.Cons: I thought it was going to be an exact duplicate of my factory made charger but it wasn't. The prongs are not the ""flip-type"" on the back. Instead, the prongs are attached via a wire. The whole apparatus is much bulkier than I had hoped."
3,Used item,"Product arrived and was just what was needed. Maybe I missed something, but this was definitely a used item. No matter, but should be advertised that way."
5,Canon CB-2LV Battery Charger,"The charger arrived in good packaging and on time.I am very happy with the product, the price and with Amazon.We have been using the charger and have had no problems what so ever. It works well with our SD450."
3,Canon CB-2LV Charger,Your have to have it & it works! It charges quickly and plugs in anywhere. The folding prongs make it easy to store.
1,Not working,"I got the defective item. The charger didn't chagre the battery, the light wasn't on. Have to return and order a new one."
1,Horrible...,Charger did not work at all. It wouldn't charge my battery so I thought maybe the battery was just dead but when I tried to charger it on my friend's charger it worked. Waste of money. Don't get it.
1,Canon Camera battery wall charger,I bought this charger thinking it would work for sure because it looks exactly like the one I displaced. IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. My camera battery won't charge at all and the little red light insists on coming on but never turning green. Even after 24 hours of charging.I'm very disappointed with this seller.Canon CB-2LV Battery Charger for the Canon NB-4L Li-Ion Battery
4,canon cb-2lv battery,This is the best battery charger there is. You plug it into the outlet on the wall and that's it. Glad I purchased it.
5,Replaced my charger that got stolen,"I had this same exact charger before and it got stolen so I just replaced it. Always loved this product, charges fast and the battery keeps a charge for a while."
4,"Received quickly, does the job","Was happy with the product! Works just as well as the original that I had! It beats buying the product from the Canon website with is like 4 times more than what I paid here. The battery lasts pretty long but I wish it was just a little bit longer...don't know if that's the normal battery life or just the charger...But overall, is a great item!!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"This is not the model that comes with the plug in a nifty little fold-out design like the original I received with my camera. I wish I had known that. Instead, it has a cord that you must attach to the blue box you put your battery in and then plug the cord into the wall. Cumbersome and ugly. If you don't mind this, it does a fine job to charge the battery."
5,Works great,Its exactly what I was looking for. I have a canon sd1000 elf that I lost the battery charger to and this is the exact replica of the original.
3,Canon CB-2LV,"Just like the one I lost. Expensive for what it is, but Amazon was as inexpensive as anyone."
5,Good charger,"Bought an off-brand battery charger first, and I've discovered that the battery gets a much longer charge from the Canon charger."
5,review,"I lost the original charger that came with my camera, but Amazon.com made it easy to replace it. easy payment, fast delivery"
5,Good charger,"I lost the charger that came with my camera, this works well, I just wish it had been a little cheaper."
4,Canon CB-2LV Charger,"Definitely worth the money to get the actual Canon charger. I ordered the ""universal"" charger from another company and it only worked once. The battery would not charge after that. Canon seems to make pretty decent products."
4,Works Well,"It's simple and does exactly what it's supposed to do. However, it is over priced, not Amazon's fault, most electronics manufacturers are way too proud of simple,necessary, accessories that cost very little to manufacture."
5,Can't live with out it,"I had to purchase this item since, I lost my first one. I previously purchased a universal canon charger and it sucked. When I received this one I realized how fast and reliable it is. I try not to leave home without it!"
4,canon camera battery charger,"the canon cb-2lv battery charger for my canon camera functions 100 percent as expected. i ordered 2 chargers from amazon so if i misplaced one, i knew where the other would be. i gave it 4 stars, not 5 stars, because of price only."
4,Great,"Had a few scratches that were not disclosed in description, but functions fine. So it was just what I needed, thanks!"
1,Broken wires,"Product was non-functional when delivered. Sounded like something was loose inside. It wasn't worth it to me to RMA the item, so I opened it up and saw one of the wires was broken where it was soldered. I re-soldered the wire to the circuit board myself, but would not expect to receive a product this way."
2,Buyer Beware,"Be wary of purchasing this from Alfatronix. The one I received had a slightly different model number (2B-2LVE) and was an obvious fake. It even came with a second-hand dusty power cord. The charger had scratches on it and its construction was very crude. Definitely, not like anything you would expect to come from Canon. The counterfeit job would probably go unnoticed to someone with poor eyesight, but to me it was obviously crude with its poor molding, gaps between the plastic, and cheap prongs (the ones the power cord connects to). I didn't even try using it because I'm certain it would have either damaged the battery or started a fire.So why 2 stars? A counterfeit item should receive ZERO stars but... I called Amazon and, right away, the customer service rep issued a refund and apologized for the inconvenience. Amazon is amazing in that regard. That's why I'll always be a loyal customer!"
5,Awesome Service!,The service was very quick. I didnt expect the charger for 10 days but it arrived in 5. It was a quick save for my cruise. :-)
3,Like... not love,"These filters are good filters, but one thing you'll need to know is that when you use these filters you'll need to zoom. Why zoom?I bought these filters for my JVC Everio230, and when went to playback the recording there was a little ring around the edge of the screen. So the only way I fixed this problem was to zoom in a little, and everything was okay after that. The quality of the filter is great. But the ring problem is an issue. Unfortunately JVC decided against continuing the production of the filters they designed for these cameras, so you have to go without a filter or zoom."
2,:(,"It is a bit big to be one size. I know I have a small head, but this hat is big enough for a man."
2,Not what I had expected...,"Has a few nice poems, but this book was DEFINITELY what I had hoped for. Many pages have what appears to be ""notes"" written in the margins, this is actually part of the book itself! Very distracting and not always MY sentiments, just random sentiments wrote by the editor or someone who wanted to get their feelings down about THEIR sons??? I bought this book to include in a care package for my military son who is on deployment, but after receiving it I decided against sending it to him."
4,A combination of the band's first two albums,"This is a quite decent collection of songs from Huey Lewis and the News' first two albums (Huey Lewis and the News and Picture This). There are a couple good songs from those early albums that aren't on here but, unless you're a hardcore fan, you'll find buying this one a better deal than both of the two earlier albums."
5,"Thriller, one of the better post ww2 examinations","This movie asks the question, how far would you go to find the answers concerning circumstances of a murdered friend, especially when that murder takes place in chaotic post ww2 Vienna.American Holley Martins must ask himself that continually, and in the process, asks himself just how much worth he attaches to friendship and loyalty.Bleak thriller, filmed in the sewers and damp night streets of Vienna in the post WW2 environment of guilt and chaos, using the back drop of a broken society to ask the larger question, which is 'what compels man to civil behavior, personal conviction or the pressure of society?' The answer may leave the viewer with chills! The movie also points out the effect on Eastern Europe that Roosevelt's allowance of Russian control had.Top notch, Cotten, Vali, Howard, and Welles are all equally good."
5,The Third Man,"Others can review the absorbing and suspenseful drama. I want to draw attention to the absolutely amazing quality of the Criterion Collection product! Dedication to providing perfection of image and a wealth of background material just radiates from this item. There is a richness of quality and depth here that will please even the most critical viewer. To those achieving this perfection I say, ""Thank you so much for setting such a high standard for all of us who do indeed recognize and appreciate the ultimate when we see it!"" How fascinating that some of the main character actors knew no english and had to learn their lines by rote! As the professionals they were, they were totally convincing!"
4,Fabulous film!,"The quality is iffy, like it was made from a copy of a copy of a copy, but the movie is just so good it doesn't take long to overlook the quality. I couldn't find an inexpensive copy of this movie, but this ""cheapest"" version made me wonder: maybe there aren't any good copies of the movie around. This would be a travesty, of course, but a movie with this much notoriety should have an affordable decent copy available somewhere. Anyway, I am happy with my purchase , which arrived on time in good condition as promised."
4,The Third Man,"Movie was good, not great. The process of ordering and receiving the movie went smoothly."
2,Poor transfer,I was extremely disappointed by the blu-ray edition of The Third Man. The digital transfer is exceedingly poor and the image looks very grainy. The movie is as thrilling as always but the image leaves a lot to be desired.
3,"Original, but not a great movie","I found this movie overrated. It has a number of original elements, e.g. mixed German and English without subtitles, leaving you just as baffled as the lead character as to what was happening. It masterfully builds suspense wanting to find out who this Harry Lime character really is. It is full of ambiguities, false leads and loose ends. It does not baldly explain everything like a Murder She Wrote episode. However, the tail end of the movie collapsed into chaos I could make no sense of. It was filmed in the dark. There was no dialog other than German. There were people running all over the place to no apparent purpose. I came away feeling cheated. The movie is deliberately underit all the way through enough to be irritating. Perhaps it works better on the big screen."
3,I just don't get it.,"Well, I hate to break the 5-star record for this movie, but here goes. Ok, so the film has very sharp contrast and bizarre camera angles. It's probably very interesting for film school students. But why is the fact that Orson Welles appears late in the movie a stroke of genius?While this is a good movie, I don't think it ranks anywhere near some other Orson works like ""A Touch of Evil."" The plot is rather dull, moves slowly and the ""surprise"" was easily predictable even though this was the first time I had seen the movie.The zither music was nice at the beginning, but the same old tune got tiresome by the end. In a lot of scenes, the rather lively music was completely inappropriate for the action on the screen. It's very hard to keep the mystery and suspense going with this monotonously happy tune blaring from the speakers."
3,Reed's Classic Not Remastered To Perfection,"The Third Man was in a terrible state of disrepair before Criterion got their hands on it. Unfortunately, this edition of the film suffers from extreme grain, digital and film, shimmering details and a rough appearance that still makes for a gritty viewing experience despite considerable restoration efforts. Orson Welles is Harry Lime, a con artist who's black market insulin sales have either killed or crippled hundreds. Joseph Cotten is Lime's best friend and totally unaware of the scam. The film is one of the post war cinemas greatest acheivements. Unfortunately, it needs a more pristine transfer than this to make it worth the while and price that Criterion is asking."
2,Third Man Aficianados Were Cheated,"Sorry to be negative, but the DVD version eliminated a key part of the entire film. You can fool most of the people, but not true aficionados who remember the original. A key part of the film occurs when Major Calloway takes Holly Martins on a tour of the hospital where children are dying as a result of Harry Lime's diluted pencillin sales. This was a pivotal scene. You cheated, folks! All the fancy technical tricks in the world can't make up for that omission. I feel robbed. The VHS version has it all, thank God."
2,Not worth the blu-ray price,"this is for my money one of the greatest movies ever made. but the video/audio quality difference between this blu-ray and the usual much cheaper dvd version is almost undetectable. the extra materials are of some interest, but they no way justify $30 for this dvd. there's no point in spending this kind of money for a reproduction that is no better than the the usual."
4,"Great Movie, Great Features","From the opening note of the soundtrack, you know you are watching a movie with something to say. Cotten and Welles are a great on screen duo and give outstanding performances. The bonus features include a great comparison of the original English version and the American version of this classic.Criterion makes the best and most informative DVD features. The amount of material on this disc is amazing considering it was made over 50 years ago.Worth buying."
4,This is Wells at his best,The movie is preserved and a faithful adaptation of Graham Greene's novel. Welles gives a signature performance in his role and as a director an even better performance. A man goes to post-war Vienna to find his friend but must solve the mystery of his friend's death and find justice amid changing developments.
5,Best intrigue movie ever made.,"Welles did not make it: Carol Reed did. Screen play by Graham Greene (before he turned it into a novel in which Holly Martin is English). Show almost stolen by Trevor Howard, even Bernard Lee (""M"" in first Bond films) is great. Valli is everyone's kind of girl. Joseph Cotten we have to identify with. Best line: ""Unwise..Holly."" This is the best intrigue movie ever made. Placed and filmed on location in post-war Vienna, rubble and all. Actors from the German (Viennese) stage are used for main small parts. According to a recent murder mystery set in Vienna when the film was made, the cafe scene where Holly displays a copy of his Western to identify himself to a ""friend"" of Harry Lime's is misplaced. Direction, mis en scene, acting, music, setting, inter alia, are beyond compare."
3,Why not letterbox?,"This is my favorite movie, so I was disappointed to find that thelong-awaited (and pricey) DVD was in ""full screen format,"" notits original aspect ratio. This film is visually stunning and should have been released in letterbox. Pity.Maybe the next media cycle.The audio reprocessing of the soundtrack is too brittle, with the background noise lowered too far --- it now sounds dubbed."
1,DisappointingI,"Great film. Rough soundtrack. And NO English subtitles--Japanese, French and Spanish, okay--but no English and I don't understand German. A very unsatisfactory experience. The studio should be embarrassed!"
1,Citerion Blu Ray Debut - Hell,Simply will not be adding this to my Bluray collection! Why? Digi pack hell! Why would anyone want Blu ray in Digi pack? If Criterion contune with Digi pack nonsense I will cease buying Criterion releases.
5,One of the Greatest of all time,"If you haven't yet eperienced Carol Reed's best work, do so now.Orson Wells' entrance alone is worth the price of admission."
1,Not worth the money. Buy the DVD.,"I bought the disk expecting to be wowed by a pristine, detailed black'n'white image that blu-ray could deliver. Could... is the operative world, because this disk doesn't. The image is no better than DVD quality. It's graining and shakes in the gate. I would thought that in the least, Criterion could have stabilized the image. But alas, they didn't.The film itself is brilliant. The best way describe the viewing experience of Criterion's edition is.... it's like watching a 16mm print on a rickety old projector, but with excellent sound.If I could return this disk, I would."
5,The subtle things are just so great in this film.,"Not the greatest plot. Perhaps not the most memorable cast.But when it comes to the subtle things, this is one of the best movies ever made.The zither music is timeless and wonderful throughout. The camera work and direction are superb. Imagine going to art gallery and hearing background music for each piece of artwork that fascinated you. That's what watching this flick is like. There's a scene about 45 minutes into the film...no dialogue.. just Holly drinking at dance bar and getting up to buy flowers from a woman. The scene is just one that's like a fine art painting with movement and sound. I might forget what this movie was about, but I will never forget this movie."
5,Classic film noir thriller,"An American writer of pulp westerns (Joseph Cotten) arrives in post-war Vienna to take a job with an old friend, but discovers he has been murdered. Or has he? This classic film noir thriller plays on national loyalties during the Cold War. Orson Welles is prefect as the manipulative Harry Lime, a black market drug dealer and Cotton does a great job as the quintessentially brash American. The underground sewer sequence is extraordinary. The film is scored with a haunting theme by Anton Karas on unaccompanied zither to an eerie effect."
1,Another disappointing transfer,"'The 3rd Man' is a wonderful who-dunnit. It is a gritty slice of life of European existence right after World War II. The story and the acting are awesome, but this transfer is terrible. It is grainy and dirty, plus it looks like a copy of a VHS tape. Too bad, since this is a great film.This edition not recommended."
3,Is Blu-ray always better?,Is Blu-Ray always better? Maybe not. I enjoyed the DVD version more. On the Blu-ray version I was constantly distracted by the tremendous amount of film grain in the picture. The movie was hard to watch because of that. The high definition became a drawback since every fault in the film became exagerated. The DVD version provided a better viewing experience.
3,"Movie great, transfer stinks","I'm a huge Orson Welles fan and couldn't wait to see this movie. Since it was coming out on blu-ray I thought I would add it to my collection. The movie was terrific, great story and performances. The problem is that it looks like crap! They put a filter over it that causes a constant thick grain that is very annoying. I got used to it but it should not have been this bad. I know it's an old film and such but come on! look at all the old films that tranfer beautifully! I bet the DVD version is cleaner. 3 stars based on picture quality. Recommend movie but be ready for a visual disappointment."
2,Only Region A?,"I have nothing bad to say about the film, or the way they treated it on blu-ray.What I do have to complain about is the region coding. I know previous Criterion DVD's were also Region 1, but for DVD's it was easy to get a region-free player. With blu-ray, that's not possible (yet, but still).As I live in the Netherlands, I'm pretty much screwed. Criterion should have made these wonderful discs region-free."
1,blue ray not nwork my machine,This DVD does not work on my machine. Others without the label blu ray work fine-- I am not going to spend additional money to buy another machine just to play blu ray. End of matter.
4,"Good film, good DVD","This DVD title is a nice transfer: the picture is clear and the focus is sharp. There is minimal grain to this clean black and white mpeg2. The image ratio is 1.33:1 (standard) and many repairs and digital editing had been done to restore this classic film. This is a fine quality DVD (as are all of Criterion's Collection).The film itself is heavily stylized with rolled camera shots, extreme close-up shots, and many night scenes with wet cobblestone roads and smoky interiors. This is early film noir with a classy European touch. The real gem of the film, aside from brilliant acting, a terrific cast, memorable characters, an intriguing story, and fabulous cinematography, is the score: sort of quasi-gypsy instrumentation that gives the film a genuine local flavor."
5,Outstanding Blu Ray,"""The Third Man"" is one of my all time favorite films. I was glad to see that the criterion collection had brought this great film to high def format. THe PQ is about the same as the previous dvd that I own, but the blacks are much blacker and the picture looks much sharper. There is a consistent amount of grain throughout the film but that is important to adding to the overall mood of the film. If you have a blu ray player and are interested in getting this film, GET IT! Being that it is cheaper than the dvd copy I would go with the blu ray copy all the way."
1,the third man,Couldn't play the dvd wrong region What do i do? This makes my whole experence terrible. What can you do to help?
2,"Bad movie, cool cinematograhpy","This movie was hard to watch because of the constantly intrusive and annoying zither music. The acting was wooden and the absurd plot moved very slowly. The cinematography was good however. This might be better as a silent movie: turn off the sound, you don't bother with the silly plot, just enjoy the images and shadows of post war bombed out Vienna. A best friend of a corrupt man learns of his crimes, betrays him, and finally shoots him. Just like real life."
1,"Boring, underwhelming film noir","I may rouse alot of ire here, but somebody has to give innocents abroad fair warning about this lousy film. Contrary to all the gushing reviews here, The Third Man is Orson Welles at his worst. The mysterious character, Harry Lime, when he is finally seen (after much buildup) is completely uninteresting and shallow. His trite dialog shows a character with no depth and reveals a writer with no imagination.And that AWFUL zither music!! This film must win the Golden Raspberry for worst soundtrack of all time!If you are an Orson Welles fan, like myself, stay away from this film. Pretend it never existed. It is not a film noir except in the most amateurish sense. You want to see a great Orson Welles film noir? A Touch of Evil is the film for you. Trust me, you'll never look at Charlton Heston the same way."
1,Not very much to say.,"I'll Make this short and sweet to the point; This movie does very poorly and it's no wonder why people {excluding critics} think that this is boring right up there with Citizen Kane. I'm sorry for other people that feel differnt, but that's just my opinon and I tell it like it is."
2,Blu-ray Too Grainy,"I rented the Blu-ray edition. While the contrast is noticeably improved over the DVD edition, I found the graininess in the close-up shots to be too distracting."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought three copies of the DVD as gifts because my wife loved the movie. Unfortunately, none of the DVDs would play. We tried them on three different DVD players."
5,very good and impressive classic film.,"I watched this film before as a TV program and became interested in it. Since then, I have wanted to get it from amazon.com but it was too expensive. This time, amazon.com sold it at a low price. So I decided to buy it. Needless to say, this film is very impressive, especially, its picture using the effect of light and shadow. I enjoyed it."
3,Mystery most foul,"The lure of the stars of this film give you great anticipation of what will unfold. Joseph Cotton walks a circuitous path to find out what happened to his old friend who has brought him to Europe with the promise of a job. Orson Welles as usual is the character in the focal point even though he doesn't appear till the final third of the movie. The story line is off putting to me, but the actors give a solid perfomrance. This shares the title of a tv show from the 50's but the plot is nothing like the TV series."
3,Average at Best,I streamed this movie using Amazon's Instant Video. The B&W and audio quality was not great. But that's typical of movies from the 1940s. I was surprised that the Orson Welles character in the movie is the complete opposite of the Michael Rennie character in the 1950s TV series. This is one movie I am happy I rented. It is not one I would want for my personal library.
1,Read this review,"I bought this movie based on reviews I read that gloated about this collection. I think those reviewers don't know what is good or funny. Unfortunately I was disapointed with this collection, and paid $18.00 for it. I didn't even laugh once, and I'm not kidding. And I like to laugh and it doesn't take me much to get there."
4,easy slicer,"Easy to hande, the potatoes sliced very evenly and quickly. The blades were a little hard for me to get in and out of the side slots but after a few times of trying it, it became much easier."
2,"Book has potential, comes up short","Overall, this book apears promising, but in the end, it fails to deliver. Some of the tips are good: smoking isn't healthy for you. Other tips are bad or dubious: esential oils are better for your skin than almost any other products. Then there's the tips that just fall into the ""just weird"" category: wash your face only once a day... or... showering for more than 5 minutes is destructive to your skin.I would have liked to see more discussion on exfoliation and antioxidants. The authors seem to entirely overlook the benefits of Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) products, focusing largely on AHA exfoliation. They also push moisturizer for all skin types, which seems kinda unnecessary.Instead of this book, I'd recomend Paula Begoun's ""Beauty Bible,"" which seems much more effectively presented, researched and documented. Note that Begoun is not a medical doctor, which makes her expertise in this area even more surprising."
1,Poor pronunciation,"From the audio sample I could tell most of the singers were not native Italian speakers. The pronunciation on several songs was medium to very poor. Although the songs are catchy, if you really want to learn good Italian it is a poor model to start with samples of poor pronunciation."
1,Horrible Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition is unreadable. I greatly enjoyed the first volume, but I had to stop reading in the first ten pages, when, in one paragraph, I was heavily jarred by seven misspelled words and a random extraneous colon in the middle of a sentence. I am no grammar Natzi, but this edition is unreadable. Kindle should be ashamed to sell such a product for $7.99. At least it was easy to get a refund."
1,Buyer Beware,"I just purchased ""Their Finest Hour"" by W. Churchill -- for Kindle.I was hoping, given the state of my vision, that I would be able to get a a kindle version so I could adjust the font size.Unfortunately, the charts are completely unreadable.I read this in several reviews, but the dates of the reviews were such that I thought they might have been referring to an older Kindle version and hoped the problem had been corrected.No such luck.Unless Rosetta fixes this problem the book is a great disappointment.However, Amazon has a return policy that will let you return the Kindle version of this book if you act within a week.If you want to check the book out, I recommend downloading and immediately checking the charts and tables to see if they will work for you. Then you will have a chance to return the book if they are a problem."
2,Kindle edition is embarrassing awful,"The book is terrific. Churchill is a gifted writer and his descriptions of the events he writes about are wonderfully vivid and riveting. The Kindle edition however has so many typos (on virtually every page) that reading the text is embarrassingly comical. No proofreading could ever have been done. The very important charts, maps and other illustrations are unreadable. Amazon Kindle should re-do the entire book. My advice is to buy this one in hardcover the Kindle edition is awful."
1,worst kindle edition,"one of the worst kindle books[ not the book itsef, it is amazing]i have ever bought,i dont belive its even worth the doller, the many charts that are throughout the book which largly add to the store can not be read, all that cam be found is ""so and so had more then so and so"" completl destroys the the book experience"
5,But why all the typos?,"Kindle has done a great service transcribing this most important historical (and entertaining) book of the 20th century. But the optical reader transcription was never edited by a human. On nearly every page are silly errors like ""arc"" for ""are"", or ""entainmemt,"" or ""fee"" for ""the,"" and so forth. Why skimp on such an important work?"
3,"Great book, poorly converted","Each volume of Churchill's History of the Second World War is a gem in its own right. Their Finest Hour is no exception. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is riddled with typos. I'm surprised a book of this quality got such shabby treatment in eBook form. Perhaps future Kindle editions will be more carefully prepared. Five star book, one star format: three star average."
3,Bad Scan,"Portions of this title are riveting. The tensions of the times in Britain come through clearly, and the bombings and sacrifices are telling. Churchill's writing style can be tedious in some areas, but the bad digital conversion adds to the issue. Several words are repeatedly misspelled in the Kindle version, and this should have been corrected before publication."
2,"A classic, but the Kindle edition is lacking","Sadly, the Kindle Edition of this work fails to do it justice. Churchill has dotted this text with numerous charts and tables illustrating the progress of the war, and every single one of them is completely illegible. The Kindle edition has included them at a shamefully useless resolution, and so I must suggest that any interested reader buy a different edition. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
1,Kindle file is corrupt and crashes K2... do not purchase!,"I'd really love to read this book. But I can't. Trying to navigate the file as provided for Kindle crashes my reader. Furthermore, it displays corrupt paragraph formatting making it practically unreadable. RosettaBooks ... the provider of the volume in digital format ... has released a profoundly inferior product. I can't speak for other Kindle versions, but if you have a K2, don't buy this. -- David Fox"
4,Maps OK on iPad,"With only 7 days to reurn the book, I thought I'd better check the legibility of the maps, tables, diagrams, etc. right away. They're fine on the iPad and horrible on my Kindle 3. In general, the Kindle rules all other devices for reading novels, but I'm finding it's capabilities for non-fiction to be lacking.I guess I'll be editing this review when i get farther into the book. I hope there aren't as many typos as early reviewers reported."
5,Their Finest Hour,This book was quite enjoyable and informative. You totally appreciate the difficulties in diplomatic manuevaring and the reasons for the fall of France and the incredibly defeatist attitude of the French. I can now understand the friction between De Gaulle and the US in later years. The only drawback was the great number of typagraphical errors in the text.Barbara Rowlings
4,The Necessary Sequel,"Their Finest Hour includes details and background of some of the more famous vignettes of World War 2: the Dunkirk Deliverance, the terrible and foreseeable Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, the British victory in Libya.Churchill's personal correspondence delivers the reader a first-hand sequential view of German aggression, Britain's ever resourceful ability to keep up technologically with the enemy, the indomitable spirit of the English people, and the incredible slowness of the American government to realize that what menaced England would menace the United States if the Republic did not join the Allied cause.What other reviewers have mentioned concerning typos is true: Rosetta did not bother proofing a horrible OCR scan, which strikes me as callously incompetent. I bought this series for $1.99 a volume as a Kindle Daily Deal, and for that price, I'll suffer the typos.The book is worth 5 stars, less one for the poor typographical rendering."
3,It''s good but not what your are expectig.,"The Artie Shaw band is a very good one. But apart for Begin the Begin and two or three tracks more, the sound is not good and the interpretación has not the brilliance one expect."
5,Artie Shaw,"Great Atie Shaw sound despite the recording in mono. Lots of big band sound, I liked Frenesi alot better than his signature Begin the Beguine."
2,Sadness,this game is amazing.I just wish they told me in the description that it will not work on a windows 7 machine.
5,Great Game,Love this game but it only works for windows xp and not windows7...It is a great entertainment for anyone and simple.
3,WORMS MUST DIE!,The first video game I ever played was worms armagedon.I got this hoping to relive those days a bit but it did not work on my windows 7.Worms 2 did work fine I did have some laughs with some old friends but we all missed the armagedon.It was still worth it
1,Won't run on Vista,"I used to have Armageddon on my old PIII, but can't for the life of me get either game to run on my Vista machine. Pisses me off because I used to love this game...."
1,Will not run on vista ;o(,"My son was so excited to get this game for Christmas after playing it at a friend's, imagine his disappointment when we realized it will not run on his computer since he has windows vista and of course you cannot return open software......."
3,Priced accordingly,I got my hopes up too high but I got exactly what I paid for. The quality of these cufflinks are not fancy but not too shabby.
4,Nice work,"Good harmonies and the appropriate enthusiasm, respect for, and devotion to the material. Two highlights are their version of the Elchords' controversial classic, Peppermint Stick (the lyrics are what we thought they might be, it seems), and their totally on-the-money take of the Marcels' My Love For You, which is just about good enough to replace my long-lost 45 version of it. I think it was the b/w of Heartaches on Colpix?"
2,my kids cry when i put these on...,"I am a teacher and I thought the concept of these videos sounded good. I got ""Meet the Sight Words"" for my 4 year old and the numbers video for a 2 year old. They cry if I put them on. They say they are for babies, and boring. I have had great success with the Leap Frog videos, as well as Word World. I think pre-school prepco products are for the very young, as in under 2 years old."
5,Wonderful!,"All 3 of my boys ages 5, 3 and 2 LOVE these dvds! They watch them in the van on the way to daycare every morning. Even the 2 year old repeats the words right along with his brothers. And, amazingly, all 3 of them are recognizing sight words everywhere! I can't believe how well these work in teaching the sight words. I highly recommend buying all 3 dvds (they also come as a set). Don't hesitate, buy these dvds!"
5,Best video out there,"We have purchased several other educational/reading videos for our two kids, but the preschool prep series by far is the best. Our now five year old is reading at about second grade level and 2 year old has an inventory of 50 sight words, thanks in large part to these videos. The characters are very appealing and the animations are great! You won't be disappointed when your child starts ""reading"" off signs and labels! Enjoy..."
2,DVD,My 3.5 year old son told me this video is for baby! He just watched once and that's it. This DVD maybe interesting if he were 18 months or 2. Definitely a no no for a reading kid.
1,Disappointed,"I teach level 1 and 2 Spanish. I was very disappointed that I will not have a use for this book after I paid so much for it. The activities do not align with my text vocab or my State Standards. Some of the puzzles are confusing and the difficulty is beyond the 7 -12 ability. In order to use many of the activities I would have to modify them to the point that it is no longer worth it. If I had had the opportunity to preview the book first I would have never bought it. Shame too, because I am sure a lot of work went into putting it together."
5,Michael W. Smith - I'll Lead you home,"This was a good buy. I enjoy Michael W. Smith when there are no more CD's available by Steven Curtis Chapman, Dallas Holm or Michael Card who are awesome musicians and composers of scriptural songs"
4,"Awesome! Hits you ""Straight to the Heart""",Wonderful CD! All songs are very inspiring. I would recommend this CD to any one who loves to hear Michael play the piano!
4,"A more ""mature"" Michael -- may not be everybody's cup of tea","This album shows Michael as a very different musician than we saw when he debued over a decade before. This album has many slower songs with orchestral accompanyment. However, the man is still a musical poet. These lyrics are probably more geared to an adult audeince than a teen one, but is still a great album."
1,Yawn.,"What is with side 2? He did it with Live the Life too. The second side of this cd, especially the ""TRILOGY"", totally makes you want to fall to sleep. What is going on with him?"
5,The Best,"This is the best Album of Smitty's yet. It has everything. ""Straight To the Heart"" really touched me. I also like ""Someday"", ""I'll Be Around"", ""I'll Lead You Home"", ""A Little Stronger Everyday"", and ""I'm Waiting For You"", which is the perfect closing song. Add this one to your collection!"
1,Will not fit!! Leak,"This filter will not fit 2001 Avalon, the connector is not the same as the Toyota one, it will leak fuel!!!!I tried 4 times and it leaks ALOT!!! Finally i looked at the old one and they are not the same, Im returning it and getting one from the dealership"
3,still wearing it,I bought this ring this year and am still wearing it - they have large sizes for my big fingers. I love it
2,"Concept great, execution poor.","The idea behind this book, of presenting the topics involved in calculus in the order in which they were developed in history, is commendable. However, the explanations, at least in the first few pages, are far too concise and confusing for my liking."
4,Book is exactly as advertised,"My mother's apartment looks over a sanctuary with an osprey nest within binocular distance from her windows. She just loves watching the birds nest each year and I knew she would love learning more about Ospreys. She absolutely raved about this book and lent it to a number of her friends with similar interests. She very much appreciated the writing and the descriptions she thought they were spot on. I purchased this hoping it would be informative and fun for her to read, and it was. I was very pleased that my mother found it to be so informative and a joy to read."
2,Blows big time,"This book, like all of the Riftwar Legacy novels, is a painful read of scripted, wooden characters that have absolutely no life to them. The plots are more like children's books, and everything is extremely predictable. The hero's are heroic, the bad guys are overtly evil, and the action is just as cartoon-like and predictable as anything being shown on Saturday mornings...It is best to skip this book, and the rest of the Riftwar Legacy along with it, and pretend it doesn't exist when you read the rest of Feist's Midkemia novels."
5,krondor the betrayal,"i have all 3 books of the riftwar legacy and am still on the first book. I really enjoy this book as well as other books by feist. This wirter is very gifted. I love Pug, prince arutha,Locklear and the famous jimmy the had. thank you so much for these jems."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"God stone sunk.Or, the bad guys don't like our religion. Can't have that.A temple raid by forces of your Dark God person sinks an important religious artifact. This leaves a bunch of Kingdom priest types lacking in power. Not so much of a problem for their opposition.So, a bit of Raise the Titanic Stone to be accomplished, which requires the unique skills of a raising from the ocean practitioner, as well as your usual cast of Midkemian heroes and adventurers to be found in the earlier books in this series."
2,Very disappointed with this effort,"I loved the Riftwar saga, and the previous trilogy. I loved the character development and scenarios that were painted - but with this book ""Tear of the Gods"", I don't know...it felt like it was created by some inexperienced creative. The characters were bland. Seriously, I wouldn't care if they all died..and that is one of the reasons I don't like this book.Some of the most powerful evil creatures to grace Feist's books were so ineffectual and inexperienced in their motives/skills that they were being thwarted by the most assanine solutions.Ultra powerful liches, vampires & skeletal warriors being killed in short order because their cleverness in hiding their soul gems in addition to just being plain impotent in their abilities. I'd expect something like this from Gary Gygax or something...which isn't bad, its just not what one expects from Feist.Are we sure he wrote this book?"
3,Just what I expected,"Ever since I read the back cover of ""Betrayal at Krondor"" the first book in The Riftwar Legacy, I knew that it would be the plot of the computer game. I didn't have my hopes up about the book's content. That being said, I'm not as disappointed as most the other reviewers. I've read all of Feist's other books at least twice but will probably not re-read this series. It's nice to see Jimmy the Hand and the beginnings of William's career in the military, but it's not the same calibur of the Riftwar, Empire or Serpentwar books. However if you are a Feist fan, you should have a little fun. Sometimes that's all I ask in a book."
2,<sigh> Poor and Underwhelming,I'll echo the words of others in these reviews and say that this is a poor novella in a generally good line of books. Feist has been one of the more consistent fantasy writers but the last three legacy books have left me cold.In fact I will go so far as to say that the novelization of the games has detracted from some of his earlier works as the familiar characters feel at best two dimensional and stilted.
2,Very Disapointed,"I've read every book writen by Raymond E Feist, and enjoyed them all. Unfortunately I found ""Tear of the Gods"" to be his weakest work. It was overly predictable and lacked the character development Feist excels in creating. A complete disapointment."
2,too much like the PC game,"This book follows the plot of the video game Return to Krondor almost exactly. As a fan of Feist I am very disappointed that I knew everything that was going to happen because I have played the game. If you haven't played the game it is a decent enough book, however, if you have played the game, save yourself some money and just play it again. You won't miss anything."
1,How Disappointing!,"Feist is one of my favorite authors. My copy of Magician is dog-earred with all the times I have re-read it. This book, on the other hand, is pure drivel.I fully agree with others who have panned this book. It smacks of basic D&D; computer game plots and is just not worth reading. Please, read the first 4 Riftwar books, the Daughter of the Empire series (wonderful & underappreciated), but skip this whole sub-series. Feist needs to take stock of what kind of writer he wants to be. Obviously he has the talent, what he does with it is up to him."
5,Mr. Feist,I guess by now if you have read any of my other reviews about Raymond Feist you must know by now that he is one of my favorite authors and the worlds and characters he creates are almost on the level with Robert A. Heinlein.
3,Far from his best work...,"This one, I must admit, was my least favorite of the trilogy. I think, because for a trilogy based on a computer game, this one felt the most like reading the transcript of someone playing a game. The inclusion of monsters, vampires and animated skeletons was just a bit too over-the-top for me. Though exciting, it just did not fit in with the the trilogy, or the overarching series as a whole. If the main character had not been one of my favorites, Jimmy the Hand, then I would have certainly hated it. I am enjoying reading all of Feist's work, but after finishing this one, I am really looking forward to re-reading the books that I remember fondly from reading the first time around."
5,Darn good fun,"While I wouldn't rate this as the best book Feist has ever written, I always welcome anything written by Feist as I never fail to be enteretained by his work. The story is a bit predictable and even contrived at points and I'm always a little put off by demons and vampires and the clear visions Feist gives of evil. However, I enjoyed reading more of ""Jimmy the Hand"" and William and the Crawler thing is, in many ways, more interesting than going to other worlds and walking amidst the ""city of the gods"". I had to buy this via amazon.uk, but it was worth the extra money."
1,No more $25 hardcopies of doublespaced-14 font PC games,"I also was hooked since Magician Apprentice and have bought everything since, but it ends here. I really wanted to like this, but this is the third time I've plunked down $20+ on a Krondor hardcover with nothing in it except that it's written in a huge font and reads like the cheats to a roll playing computer game. If Feist didn't write this, then he really doesn't want to write about Krondor anymore. There's no feeling for the characters, they go from town to town solving riddles and quests that I really don't care about anymore. I'll go back to rereading his earlier work, but won't go for the new hard covers anymore. This will be a pamphlet when it's released in paperback. I suggest you wait for it and read it inbetween class or on the train. I was really dissappointed. I feel taken. I'd be curious to know why some people liked it(though I have a feeling that being short or helping them solve the eventual PC game might be the best reasons)."
2,Dissapointed,"As with other readers I was extremely dissapointed by his latest 3 works, The Riftwar Legacy. About 8 years ago I picked up a hardback book at a yard sale of Feists Magician Apprentice and Master. I was so taken away that I immediatley bought every book he had and waited eagerly for the next. Anyone who knows Fesit knows him as a gifted writer, able to make his readers love and understand his characters. I even wanted to cry as Jimmy died, and felt my own blood rushing as Arutha defended Crydee. Alas this new series has none of that. It has left me to think that Feist has only taken a video games plot and added a few more words for the sake of it. I only hope he will continue the series as it was and continue to amaze us with the skills that make him one of the best ever."
1,Not up to his usual quality,"Based on a computer game, and reads like one. Vampires here! Skeletons there! I don't know if this is going to be the quality of all future Feist books, but the Riftwar Legacy as a whole and especially Tear of the Gods are WAY below his normal quality level. Tear of the Gods is the first fantasy book that I almost didn't finish because it was just so monotonous. There was so much action and adventure that by the time the climax actually arrived, I could barely tell from all the wild adventures Jimmy and his friends had already had. If you've read the other two and you feel like you need to read this one, then borrow it from the library because it is not worth it to buy this book."
1,Don't waste your time,"Hard to believe this is from the author of ""Magician"" and the ""Empire"" series. Tedious, trite, unimaginative - unfortunately consistent with the rest of this dreadful series."
3,"Feist continues to write excellent books, but not this one..","This is the third, and probably last, book of the Riftwar Saga.Being a favorite of mine, I must say this book mostly does it justice, but there are some definite issues.One, it's a bit too short, sweet, but never-the-less, short. Sure, there are lots of pages, yes, but the font is huge, and the content is somewhat lacking in the end. I read it straight through in 1.5 hours or so (the other two books in the series took me 2-2.5 each).Two, the story is a bit mucky, there are some twists and turns, but none of the finely woven conspiracies which made his other writings famous.Three, he did not develop inter-character relationships very well during the book, some of the characters (especially the new introduction, Jazhara) seem a bit transparent, and lack emotional depth.Those may seem like big holes, but really they're not, all in all fans will be pleased, and this is a good fantasy read in the end."
3,Has PC game written all over,"The only books I read now are from Raymond Feist. I've given up on the other fantasy authors due to various reasons. So saying that, I consider Feist to be one of the best writers so far.The first two in the riftwar legacy were rather enjoyable reads but don't come close to his riftwar books. Now with Tear of Gods I am a bit further disappointed. When I was reading it, I could tell immediately this was geared towards the PC game plot. I understand the business necessity of doing so though... If you"
1,Keep looking...or buy cheaper at a local Big Box Store...,"All Batteries dead on arrival (dealer doesn't rotate stock?). Cheaper at Wal-Mart with Tax.-The unit has limitations. The switch mechanism is extremely poorly designed, you operate the unit by rotating the battery cup into a position that compresses a leaf spring. Initially the unit is difficult to operate because of stiffness. Eventually the unit becomes too loose, and the leaf switch (a small piece of metal that wears easily) become too weak to stay on.Imagine a cheap dime store AA pen light that you twist on. This unit's construction is very durable (aluminum casing), but the overall wear upon use of the product's cheap plastic switch severely impeads it's longevity.Save your money, spend another $20 and get something that will last more than 5-6 uses."
1,Pile of Junk,"The first one had a problem with the dot size. It would start out small but as the laser warmed up or over a few minutes of useage, the dot was the size of a quarter at 25 yards. I call Laserlyte and told me to ship it back. They got it and told me there was nothing wrong with it?? She said the dot size was fine?? They sent me a new one and this one isn't much better than the other one. The dot size is small up to about 30 feet and then it just flares out. Not a great sighter."
4,My inspiration to become a virologist,"I read this book in 1975, after graduating from college. It was riveting. When I finished it, I decided I wanted to study viruses. The next year I entered graduate school to earn a Ph.D. in viruses, and the rest is history. Highly recommended account of virology before the catchphrase 'emerging infection' was coined, before BSL4 facilities and physicians worrying about themselves. For a personal account of the history written in 'Fever!', see the podcast 'This Week in Virology'."
4,An excellent read but slightly disturbing!,"I read this book when I lived in Yola (just south of Lassa) by accident and was surprised to find I was so close to such an infamous place but never went there. For me it captures Nigeria pretty well as well as chronicling the path of such a lethal disease. I decided to buy a copy as it is such a good read and have been even more surprised that the ""Out of Print"" copy I got from Amazon was in really such excellent condition."
1,"Not much better than ""sounding"" with a hammer, if that good","I went right by the directions, but it would designate that I was center stud, and my nails would go right through the drywall, finding nothing behind it. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk."
2,Too Hit or Miss For Me,"It looks like a lot of people didn't RTFM before reviewing but I still feel like mine's a little too hit or miss to be worthwile, particularly in an old Chicago apartment that's probably had one too many layers of paint on it without a good stripping. But it's not exactly an arm and a leg either. It might be helpful if your walls aren't overly demanding. I think mine probably are. I found myself tap-tapping instead and then checking (and hoping) that it detects AC more easily than studs. I'm hoping that Milwaukee m12 scanner isn't an arm and a leg when it finally releases because I would like something like this that works reliably and sensibly. The interface and feedback are kind of crummy too. So yeah, it's not an arm and a leg but I would have gotten more out of a pizza and some beers."
2,Indicated studs where there were none,Thirty-five bucks for a stud finder with a lively imagination! It'll cost more than that to repair the wall damage.
2,Weak at best,"This is the first stud finder I've owned and unfortunately, I'm not impressed. The unit fails to locate studs where I know they exist and is marginal at best in locating other studs behind dry wall."
4,Decent Stud Finder,"I used this to find studs to mount a 46"" Samsung LCD. It's a heavy screen and I would prefer that it didn't fall off the wall. This finder found the studs it was looking for, BUT it took a lot of checks and rechecks since they are behind about 3/4"" of plaster and 1/2"" plaster board (I think that's what it's called). In the end there were no holes drilled in vein and the TV is mounted firmly to the wall.Oh yeah, it also warned me of a live wire in the wall. That was nice. :P"
4,Stud finder,"Good product works just fine I'm the one who sucks at handyman work,no all jokes aside there are much more expensive stud finders out there .This is all you need ."
2,slightly complicated,I purchased this for my husband and he did not like all the bells and whistles...too complicated for him.
1,3 holes later...,"...went back to ""knocking,"" as I was getting false positives all over the wall. As a previous reviewer stated, insulated or, in my case, townhouse 'party wall systems' seem to give bad readings with this $29.98 paperweight. Hopefully I'll be able to return it.As for the ""AC Sensor,"" I am framing an area in the garage where I plan to build my work bench...wiring an outlet...put a piece of sheetrock up and tried to detect the AC, which was hot...detected it about 3 feet away...and nothing over the wiring...food for thought."
4,Still the Best Cards Around,"My great-grandmother always played with these cards, and they're still the best around. I bought these as a housewarming gift for a friend. They will last a super-long time!"
4,Quite Good - Little Too Flexible,"Being KEM, obviously this product is good. However, it is a little more flexible than I thought it would be. I would have preferred in to be a Matt surface for a better feel. However, this is the best thing that I have seen that can be shipped to places outside the USA."
2,defective,"First of all, I want to tell you I love KEM cards, but this set up was defective and I waited to long before I opened it to return them. First off, one deck was thicker than the other, by about 10 cards. One deck had a bad King and the other deck had a card with a tiny little plastic chunk on the side. I thought I could just remove it with my thumb nail, but when I did the card ripped. So within five minutes of play, I had two decks that were no good.So check them out as soon as you get them. I don't think they are as well made as the cards from 10 years ago."
5,Fun to play with and extra durable,"I grew up in a family that played all their card games with KEM cards. Over 20 years later, we still play with those same exact cards. Since these cards are 100% plastic, they don't get bent as easily and they will not get ruined by water (or coffee as was the case in my family). Remembering how well KEM cards held up, and starting my own family game nights, I decided to get some of these cards knowing they would last a long time. While they certainly don't have a true paper feel and tend to be a little on the slippery side, they are great cards and we look forward to the many game nights to come."
2,"One of Oldfield's worst, actually!","Oldfield was forced by Virgin to write pop music in the 80's, and this is mediocre 80's pop at it's worst. Fortunately, he broke out of it and is currently releasing great music again."
2,Eurovision Song Contest,"Like many instrumental muso's, Mike Oldfield really isn't the strongest of song writers. There are the exceptions however, like the Maggie Reilly sessions! This album really is bad though when you compare it to past and present works. If you are an Oldfield fan looking through his catalogue then don't worry if you never get to hear this! It's just a collection of uninspiring, digitally over produced, sugary ballads that would sit very well on the Eurovision Song Contest stage. Mike is musically eclectic by nature, we know this and are prepared to give time to his self indulgences just because he really is a genius. But there are times when one should not kid oneself! I bought this album and lent it someone, 10 years ago! I haven't seen it since and I'm not bothered. Mike has produced some very wide ranging and enjoyable material over the years but Earth Moving isn't even remotely ""moving"". Thankfully, through the nineties things have changed. Buy this album at your peril!"
2,Oldfield???,"This is far from Mike Oldfield. If you wanna hear plain 80's pop you must have it If you are a true Oldfield-fan, don't bother buying it."
4,Not as great as Discovery but still good,"Okay, this is not his greatest but still enjoyable. Don't listen 2 this CD that it is another album of the creator of Amarok or Omadawn. No! This is a pop-rock album from Mike, and it has some really nice tracks on it I think! If U don't like his pop songs, don't buy it, but if U liked Discovery's, Islands' or Crises' pop songs then it is the time 4 U 2 get it!"
1,O Jerusalem,oo much about the fighting and not enough novel about the people and what they were feeling. I got tired of just listing the names of all the army personnel.
5,A good foundation for understanding the conflict in Israel,"This is a must read for anyone interested in Israel, Judaism, Palestinians or any aspect of the Middle East conflicts that have raged for centuries. It is well written and generally unbiased."
2,Biased and full of myths,"The authors portray the bloodthirsty Arab invaders as noble fighters and devote a disproportional amount of writing to the alleged massacre at Deir Yassin. They make the libelous claim that Jews raped Arab women, looted, mutilated, and executed civilians. Even the Arabs themselves admitted that the ""massacre"" didn't take place and that Arab propaganda made up the atrocity and rape stories in order to whip up the Arabs into a murderous anti-Jewish frenzy.Stay away from this biased and mythological account. It is anti-Israeli fiction, not a serious historic account."
5,Gripping,I enjoyed this book tremdously. I go through times when I'm reading alot and times when I'm reading just a little and this book just took over and I had a very hard time putting it down.If you have any interest in Israel then this book is a must read.My thanks to the Author and all who collaborated.
2,Weak with out the Bangles,"I do own the album, but honestly without the rest of the bangles she just can't carry it off. Every song is a Bangles wanna be song. Susanna knows her voice isn't strong enough to be on its own, or to do something different. Back in the Early Days the Bangles were a quasi punk band.Why didn't she try that instead of trying to sound like the Bangles."
3,"Not so great, coming from one of the greats.","This is a not so great release from one of the 80's biggest Icons, Susanna Hoffs. Her first failed attempt as a solo artist,after the break up of the super group Bangles. There are only a tiny handful of note worthy songs on this CD. Most of the songs are kind of Poppy, a sound that clashes with the style of music Susanna's fans associate with her. My Side of the Bed, Unconditional Love, and This Time are probably the best cuts. These songs will be more familiar to the ears of her fans.I bought this CD knowing this. I'm a big fan and wanted it for my collection. That would be the only logical reason to buy this CD."
5,Very Good Pop Music,"This CD makes no pretentions at being anything other than a middle of the road pop album. In that respect, Susanna Hoffs is in fine voice, and while this type of album often tends to be overproduced, I really enjoy listening to almost every song here. I can assure one of the other reviewers that Susanna Hoffs, indeed, can sing. You may not like her song choices on this project, but the lady has a lovely voice."
3,"Not the strongest album around, but anything by Susanna Hoffs can't be that bad","Her sugary sweet voice resulted in many hits for the Bangles, and the quality of it certainly doesn't diminish here. However, much of the material here is bland and soulless; someone like Susanna Hoffs deserves better songs to work with. The track ""Only Love"" isn't bad."
3,"Hoffs hit the gong here, at least once","Doggonit, someone has to stand up here and say that ""My Side of the Bed"" is an absolutely smashing song that makes this CD a buy regardless of what else is on it (some decent songs, as it turns out). It's all-time pop classic with great hooks and deserves some recognition here.By the way, the video . . . woof! There's something about a half-nekkid girl with great hair sitting on a white bed with a big red guitar . . . darn right, I'll lay with you. Well, fifteen years ago. And without the guitar of course."
3,Right product,"They work in my 2004 Mazda MPV, but actually one of them was shot when it was installed. Thankfully the mechanic has a guy who orders parts, so he was able to switch it out with him, didn't have to go through the hassle of returning to Amazon."
1,OEM / Motorcraft coils suck THEY WILL FAIL,Please do yourself a favor. Spend your money on Borg Warner coils that will last longer than your vehicle. Always buy Borg Warner products and you will never have a problem NEVER !
4,A lot of Fun!,"To be perfectly honest with you, I went to this movie last summer completely convinced that I was wasting my money. I couldn't have been more wrong.When the president of a robotics company(James Cromwell) is found dead in his own lobby, supposedly from suicide, Will Smith's Detective Spooner is sent to investigate. Using Isaac Asimov's story as a basis, the filmmakers took a typical whodunit motif and injected it with a sci-fi twist. The futuristic setting is made more believable than most other science fiction movies I've seen, and the visual effects, although mainly constructed with the help of computer-enhanced technology, are quite good. When these things are combined to make I, Robot, the results are very entertaining."
3,"Good movie, would not buy though/rent",Good movie that kept me interested. There were a couple of parts that made me think of Men in Black but over all good acting by Will Smith. Not a movie I would take the time to watch again though.
1,Other tools are more practical,The gripper grabs the top of sheet goods as promised and has a comfortable grip. Unfortunately it is still easier to carry a sheet from the bottom with a $7 Stanley panel carrier.
1,Gripe gripper,It's hard to use. It's better to pick up plywood by hand. You can't get it by the bottom. Not happy
3,great product if you are a strong young (person),"resonably priced, very well made, BUT !!! a 4x8 sheet of MDF is heavy. I will keep this product to move 1/2 sheets off the panel saw. Then it is a 5 star!"
3,Ok product,"I ordered the Gorilla Gripper to assist me with moving 10' sheets of drywall. If I was walking on level ground, the Gripper worked perfectly. When I would attempt to go up/down stairs (tilting the drywall at an angle), the drywall would slip out.... and of course the corners would be damaged. Luckily I was still able to utilize the sheets by using them elsewhere."
5,Moving plywood is much easier,"When I decided to make my own kitchen cabinets, I knew I was in for a lot on work. But I forgot jus how heavy full sheets i plywood are, especially when you are cutting several dozen into parts. This tool makes moving them without a helper amazingly easy. It grips, too. Even with pre finished plywood."
4,Gorilla Gripper,"Item has a high price for what it is, but it does do what it claims to do.Just a bit pricey."
5,It really does grip and go.,"The Gorilla Gripper really makes moving large, flat objects much safer and easier. I highly recommend it."
2,use it if you want s1 to get killed,"I love this tool, but it could be better!This gripper is good, but needs to add an autolock once a panel in place, because once the handle is loss the board will slip off.. Dont use it to lift board to roof, especially if someone is holding the board from the bottom as the video claim what it can be done!"
4,works as advertised,"It holds panels well but I feel holding a heavy one in that position a little cumbersome, but I haven't found anything better"
4,DECEIVINGLY SIMPLE,"Now, if this device could only make a 4X8 piece of 3/4 inch ply lighter, it would be great. Unfortunately it cannot. But it can do the next best thing. Instead of having to push your ply along the ground and hope you don't hit a crack or get stuck on something, this deceivingly simple , but well built device lifts the panel off the ground for easier maneuverability. The body position when lifting is also easier on the back and shoulders, then trying to jerk it around. It's well built, but I think a bit overpriced."
3,Seems quite clever,"I was intrigued by the design of this tool, but I've had it in plain sight in my work shop for half a year and have yet to figure out how I want to use it. Hopefully I will make good use of it some day."
2,Over-rated,This product isn't exatly what they say it is. If you are a person who has muscles in your upper arms (which is most men) it is next to impossible to get your arms bent to use this gripper. It was easy for a woman to use but for a man NO. I believe that is why they used a woman on their video commercial.
4,Legacy Builders,"Nice idea and strongly designed. It worked very well on plywood, NOT so well on OSB, mainly because OSB has a smooth/slippery side. I had a few sheets slip out of the grip while walking. Hope this info helps!"
5,GREATTTTTTT!,If you need to move more than 1 or 2 sheets of any 4 x 8 material this is a backsaver. Wish I had purchased it earlier.
1,dont waste your $$$,it is a novel idea but for me it didnt help. I needed to move 50 sheets of Drywall from outside up 3 steps into house and down twelve into basement. with narrow stair. it didnt work. as soon a I got 4 steps down and needed to tilt the panel down the stair it hit a stair tread the weight was taken off the gripper and it fell out of it. and bounced down the step crushing the bottom corners. it maybe useful for flat carry by a single person but not up and down stairs. I consider it a waste of money on my part and plan to put it on ebay to see if someone else wants it.
5,The Gorilla Gripper,"This thing is awesome! If you have every had to work alone, carrying panels, you MUST have one of these! My husband and I built our home alone and used one of these constantly!Here is a great product review of it:[...]Buy it! You won't be disapointed!"
3,Video can be misleading,I watched the video and thought this would be a helpful product for handling sheets of plywood by myself. By no means am I the weakest person nor the strongest but I started with 3/4 inch plywood and it's not as painless to carry as it appears. Apparently on the video they are really strong or its 1/4 inch plywood. The product did work and I will continue to use it but with the heavier plywood I found myself bracing my wrist with my other hand. I have not tried it on drywall but I'm sure it will make carrying drywall easier by oneself.
4,works as advertised.,Works as advertised. I'm sure glad I got this item to lift wood and drywall. I don't always have the luxury of someone helping me lift or move.
4,Does What it Says,"This is NOT an insurance class and is not state specific! However, it does what it is intended to do, and that is to give you a general overview of what is on the test. The CD only allows so many attempts. However, if you read the book and are able to pass all the quizs in the book, then move to the electronic chapter quizes and pass them, and them do the practice exams you should have retained enough to pass the test. I did on both LHA and P&C with this book....Taught me more than the only class I took."
3,Identical to online Kaplan course,"This book has great information and is pretty well-written. HOWEVER, I ordered it to supplement my online Kaplan course and was extremely disappointed to find out it is virtually identical (like 98%) to the study content of Kaplan. Nowhere does the book say it is affiliated with Kaplan, so I feel duped. I wasted $18 overnighting it several days before my CA State Insurance exam only to find out I already had the info! In addition, it is outdated. Most of the content is still applicable, but certain tax laws and statutes have changed since 2005 (as one would expect), so if you buy this book, don't take it at it's word on any tax information or specific investing levels."
4,Life and Helath Insurance Exam,"Very good item to purchase - well written and instrumental tool in helping you to pass the exam,"
3,"Good book, CD DOES NOT WORK ON MAC","The book contains good information, and is presented in a way that is easy to learn. However, one of the key buying factors for this item was that it came with a CD. The CD will not run on my Mac, and I do not have a PC. This is extremely frustrating to me, and should have been stated in the listing/description."
1,What a Waste of Money,This book was totally useless and contained little or none of the information I need for the licensing exam. I spent too much time looking for answers that did not exist. Thank goodness my sponsor had a good online training system that gave me training to pass the exam on my 1st try.
4,Bowie's music is timeless--even if it comes from the 80's!,"This is David's funnest record. It may be 80's pop, but it is great 80's pop. The mood and instrumentation are consistent throughout the album, but every song is musically interesting. My favorites are ""China Girl"" and ""Let's Dance."" Also features some nice guitar work from SRV."
5,What are all you old farts talking about?,"This album is not a sell-out. Its just David Bowie changing again. Sure its 80's pop, but remember most of all those 80's pop bands came AFTER this album, obviously because they were heavily influenced by it, as well as Scary Mosters, and Low. If you listen to the music and lyrics, its immediately obvious that he put plenty of effort into this album, and its completely different from anything else he'd done previous to it. There are only 2 songs that I'd consider less than perfect, (Shake It and Ricochet) but they still creep into your skull and wont go away, because they're so damn catchy. Gimme a break. It seems some people would rather Bowie stay repetitive and boring like so many others. Even if you don't like his changing styles you gotta at least give him credit for always writing great music and great lyrics."
3,should've been an EP or something.,"Each of the 3 truly fantastic songs on this album (""Modern Love"" ""China Girl"" and ""Let's Dance"") earn their very own star. The rest is thoroughly forgettable."
4,Damn good 80's Bowie,"Just listening to this again, and I still really like it, and that is all that matters right? There are many good comments on this album, the mixing of rock and dance etc. I agree. It is also interesting to listen to Stevie Ray Vaughn (RIP) on this, not in his element, but laying down such tasty licks. On the concert Earl Slick (and the always superb Carlos Alomar) handle the guitar work, I must admit that I preferred Peter Frampton's work with Bowie later in the 80's. Having the drummer and guitarist/producer from Chic (Tony Thompson and the awesome Nile Rodgers) working on this obviously helped marry the two sounds together. All in all, one of the better albums of the 80's. The ""official"" reviewer on this is probably one of those guys who only likes things when they are really popular, I feel so sorry for him, what current throwaway pop music drivel to you think he is listening to right now? cheers."
3,Mostly bland pop,"Although this album was a huge commercial success and gave Bowie three top 5 singles in Modern Love, China Girl and the title track, it's not a memorable Bowie work. I won't say it hasn't aged well, because as danceable pop it ranks amongst the best. In Bowie's ouevre, however, it doesn't hold up well against his best work like Station To Station, the Eno albums or most of his other 70's work. Of the three hits, Let's Dance is the only one that I can still listen to, because of its funky feel. The rest of the original tracks are forgettable, throwaway numbers that add nothing to Bowie's reputation. This edition of the album includes two hit singles that didn't appear on the original: Cat People and the spectacular Under Pressure (with Queen) and that is the only reason I'm giving it three stars. Without these inclusions, it would have been two."
5,"*Maybe Not the Best, but a Good One*","I've got this one on vinyl, and I do think that I'll upgrade to a CD some time in the near future. I would not label this album as a poor album, but I wouldn't call it the best either. It has two amazing tracks, ""Let's Dance"" and ""China Girl"". The rest of the songs are very well done, but near the end of the disc they begin to get repetitive, and merge together in my mind.It's not the *best* Bowie album of all time, but if you're just starting a Bowie collection, this one should be in there someplace. (By the way, Bowie has so much wonderful music out there, don't let the fact that I feel it's not the best fool you. Even Bowie on a bad day is better than a lot of musicians ever get. I did give it five stars. This is a good album.)"
1,Bowie goes pop,Let's Dance has got a lot to answer for. It marks the first step away from the 'Golden Age' of Bowie's recording career and it led to an artistic freefall which took a decade for him to recover from. Dreadful.
3,Bowie Goes Pop!,"This hit mainstream big time on the wings of three solid singles (Let's Dance, Modern Love, China Girl) though most of the rest of the songs seem like filler. The singles have become classic Bowie and the rest of the tracks are almost forgettable like a lot of other fluff from the 80's."
2,Almost lost him here...,"He got famous and rich and his music suffered. To this, Bowie himself admitted, in a VH1 interview. ""Let's Dance"", without doubt, is the absolute worst Bowie cd I have ever heard. I'd rather listen to Spinal Tap Live, than this. I tried so so hard for so so long to like this cd, but I never could. The musical and lyrical content is weak and insipid. There is nothing new or ""ground-breaking"" about it, which is Bowie's hallmark. I have always admired Bowie for his disconcern for the status quo but this cd is music for the masses; a printing press for money. I do NOT recommend this cd if you have a mind of your own. If you want to baahh along with the other sheep, go for it. Though he screwed up this one (and the next couple of cd's), he MAJORLY righted himself with Tin Machine and hence.When it comes to Bowie, just try to forget the 80's altogether. Try ""Lodger"" or ""Scary Monsters""."
3,ricochette,"Panned by Bowie fans when it first came out, 'Let's Dance' has one of Bowie's finest art-rock tracks, ""Ricochette"". The industrical rythyms digging like oil rigs rocking back and forth as Bowie does a haunting monologue about the soul-crushing effects of the 9-5 life.My favorite part on the entire CD comes on this track when Bowie sings ""turn the holy pictures, so they face the walls."" Almost as good as ""Always Crashing in the Same Car"" from 'Low'."
4,SACD sounds great,"I have always been a big Bowie fan, but I came along later in his musical career. In fact, Let's Dance was my 1st introduction to Bowie when I was about 12, so it always has a special place in my heart. The only earlier Bowie I listened to for a long time was from his greatest hits, Changes One. Anyway, I finally began collecting his earlier stuff and now own most of his pre=80's cannon. I never bought Let's Dance on cd, so when it came out as a hybrid SACD, I decided to get it. I don't have the original cd to compare it,with, but the SACD sounds great. Incredibly clear, incredibly crisp sound. Unfortunately, they released this as a 2-channel stereo SACD instead of the multi-channel, so it is limited in that regard. However, it sounds great and highly recommended."
2,It's got some redeeming qualities......,"Bowie's usually worth a 3-4 in my book but this is really worth 0. The 2 stars for getting Stevie Ray Vaughan as guitar man. 1 for the chugga-chugga opening on Modern Love and 1 for the solo on Let's Dance helps Bowie break even on something that, let's face it, isn't worth the money (compared to what he's done before and, occasionally, since). Good only for the fact that it gave the world at large the first earful of a new guitar god....then again, i really should knock it down to a .5 just for his pretending to be Stevie Ray in the let's dance video...sad."
1,Bowie sells out for Yuppie Super Stardom,"I think my title says it all. The music is infectious pop and the only tune worth considering is ""China Girl"" and only because of the comic xylaphone (sorry about the spelling) riff."
3,Bowie is overrated,"i liked this disc alright.Modern Love,China Girl,Lets Dance were good songs.his 70's stuff was okay his 90's stuff stinks.as a businessman he is a genius but musically he has been dead for many moons.he is a so/so singer,average musician,and a okay writer.his image is his real legacy.Little Richard his hero did everything that Bowie did and did it better but didn't get the Love.Bowie is catchy but not that great or even good of an artist.he is vastly overrated to me."
1,Very bland pop for Bowie.,"As a Bowie-ologist, I was disappointed in this album overall. I think he lost it (musically) after ""Scary Monsters""."
1,"Racist Song, Poor Album","No matter what else he's done, I find China Girl to be an awful, racist song. People would raise objections if there were songs called Black Girl or Mexican Girl. I do not appreciate the double standard. Furthermore, Bowie continues to be a trend follower rather than a trend setter, which is why he is no longer comercially or artistically viable."
1,TERRIBLE,"I HATE THIS ALBUM!!! I have always hated this album and always will!!! I am a huge Bowie fan and I HATE THIS ALBUM!!! Not because of the blatant commercialism of it but because it is terrible. There is honestly not a single track that I can say that is essential for me. The title track and biggest single is a nightmare of insipid one liners, China Girl and Modern Love I liked when they were released but have come to detest over time. All other tracks are throw aways. His rerecording of Putting Out Fire is shameful (I love the original from the movie 'Cat People'). The only track I even remotely like is 'Criminal World' and even that is being generous. I even liked 'Tonight' and 'Never Let Me Down' better than this album. At least those albums had 'loving the alien' and 'time will crawl'.Is it just me?!?!?"
3,If you must sell out...,"...you might do it like this. Modern Love is the best hit from this cd. China Girl is a rethinking of an Iggy Pop song. It was fashionable to frown on Bowie's version which is much more commerical, and has layered motifs. But... Bowie's China Girl is a pretty nice song, with great production.Lots of people prefer Marvin Gaye's Heard it Through the Grapevine which is a similar rethinking of Aretha Franklin's version. Both are good.I really like China Girl, even after all this time. The rest of the album doens't particularly stand out. It's neither a masterpiece, or a dud. Bowie pretty much ended his air-able canon with this cd."
4,Some return to his old form,Who knows what he was thinking? Or maybe he was really in love.Not modern love. Bowie was dating a cover model at this time.And from all accounts he was really happy not just staged for the for thr press. This album has the same catchy tunes that a lot of his earlier work did very Danceable and it sounds good which takes effort. Bowie put a lot fo effort into let's dance.
4,what about SRV back up on Let's Dance?,Stevie Ray Vaughn was just starting out on this song track and he realy hit the nail on the head with his guitar playing.
3,"Good Stereo Sound, but NOT multi-channel","There's little doubt that ""Let's Dance"" was a Bowie landmark album and a very strong one at that. With eight solid cuts, it rose to the top of the charts. This new SACD version is remarkably clear and precise, making it sound almost as good as the vinyl release from so many years ago. However, unlike ""Scary Monsters"" and ""Ziggy Stardust"", this SACD is stereo only and not multi-channel. The bass (which is one of the albums strongest points) is mixed at a lower level than the original album. This makes no sense. If multi-channel does not excite you, this might make you happy, but I'd like to hear the fullest range of a Bowie album, if it is to be re-released."
3,"Good (as always), but it's not Dave.","I bought this album because I heard Let's Dance on the radio. It was a Bowie song I never heard, but I liked it so I bought the album. It had some pretty ""okay"" songs on it. Let's Dance and China Girl are definately the highlights on this record, and perhaps the only highlights. The others are enjoyable, but they don't rank in David Bowie's best. At least David managed to make an album with 2 of his best and most popular songs.In conclusion, I HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone who's a die-hard fan of David Bowie. If you don't exactly worship at the alter of Dave but own some of his work, you may want to stay clear of Let's Dance and just download the songs Let's Dance and China Girl."
5,A most excellent presentation,"This work is a wonderful explanation of a plague that is resting on the Lord's house in our time. To borrow from Dr. Thomas, this book explains the sea of uncertainty that the church has loosed herself onto by leaving behind the methods of Biblical interpretation that have secured it. We have begun handling our sword without care, and we are now paying the price. This text traces the methods that have been used to alter the principles that have secured our faith, and more, it charts a clear path back to the firm foundation of true understanding of the Scriptures. This book is a must read for all those who care about the interpretation of Scripture, whether a man is seminary trained or not, this book will have great value."
2,Book lacks detail,"The book informs you of various sql commands, but fails to give you the general syntax. If what you are trying to do has not been explicitely done in the book, it is unlikely to find what you are looking for in the book. The book is truly a workbook, and nothing else, and should not be purchased as an oracle sql refrence book."
4,An Handy User's Guide,This book is a great reference tool for production use. The exercises mirror real world use. I learned very quickly from using this book about proper SQL structures and understanding the logic behind SQL.
4,Misleading Title...,"This book is titled Oracle SQL Interactive Workbook. The problem with it is that its the exact book as Oracle SQL by Example. When you see ""interactive workbook"" what comes to mind is a book that has pages and pages of problems in it for you to practice. Not a textbook with Labs and exercises just like any other textbook. It should have been made clear that ORACLE by Example was a NEW title for the Oracle SQL Interactive workbook so you wouldnt think you were getting pages of exercises. The book itself is an excellent book and the information in it is VERY useful. I was just looking for a WORKBOOK."
2,Oracle SQL needs Help,"This book waltzes through conceptually difficult material for the novice SQL'er. Correlated subqueries are given 3 pages. This is ridiculous! Furthermore, before a SQL novice can digest the conceptual ideas, Rishert presents examples which differ from what the novice is trying to digest. Yes, the examples present true information, but they leave the novice wondering what makes sense. The book needs a re-write if it wants to be presented to the community as a 'learning tool'. I'd recommend it to a novice provided the novice has a tutor on call."
2,Extremely Basic,"I thought this book would have many comprehensive examples of subnetting - it does not. A previous reviewer mentioned the quality of the book, and they are correct; it does appear as if it was printed on a laser printer in someones basement. The pages are printed single-sided with a very large font. All in all, the content of this book is easily found in any book on tcp/ip; just take any chapter on subnetting, enlarge the font, print single-sided on a laser printer, and you have this book. Only purchase this book if you are an ABSOLUTE beginner. If you are looking for many concrete examples, I would definitely pass. I have returned the book for a refund."
5,evaluation of TCP/IP addressing,The author of this book explained in detail on how to use TCP/IP. He also defined the meaning of TCP/IP and explained the advantages and disadvantages of TCP/IP.
4,The Last Promise,"Good, enjoyable book. I hadn't read anything by Evans in awhile, but will read more in the future. This book held my interest and even though the outcome was predictable, the path to the ending was not. I recommend this book."
5,Great Romance Novel,"This is the first Richard Paul Evans book I have read and I loved it. I am not a big romance book person but I could not put it down and have read it three times in the past year. You can actually feel the pain the Eliana is going through. It also has good morals and makes you think about your own life, love life or not."
3,"Decent plot, so so writing","I only picked this book up because it was set in Tuscany, I had never heard of the writer. The plot was so-so and overly used, but interesting. I would have loved it if he had actually desbribed the places in Tuscany with feeling and the senses, not as a tourist guide reading a map. Not the best writing, but casual reading. I much prefer Diana Gabaldon."
3,Entertaining - Hollywood style,"Although Evans pulls a plausible story together from among seemingly ordinary people, Italian & American, and entertained me with it, I questioned often while reading, ""are Italian men generally this immoral?"" In the end I answered my own question, ""No. It is just entertainment. It was written for Hollywood. It is fiction, it is fiction, it is fiction..."" Why do I long for novels from Evans that are more true to life? I'm in the wrong section, sorry."
5,LOVE STORY SET IN TUSCANY,"Another emotional story from Richard Paul Evans. Eliana meets the author poolside at an Italian resort. She begins to tell him the ""love story"" of her life. Very interesting and emotional."
4,a beautiful piece of work,"I loved The Last Promice. It was written with vivid imagery and a realistic plot line. I could almost smell the grapes on the vine and see the brilliant sunsets. I guess I have to admit that I miss the smaller size of the authors previous books. The rough pages and smaller size made me feel as if I was opening a private journal of someones life. Though the characters were american born, I couldn't relate to the almost to perfect Eliana. Her conflict was honest and sad, but to have the hero just ""magically"" pop out of know where seemed to organized. I like it when R.P.E. gives us great stories of people we can relate to. Eliana and Ross were lovely to look at but difficult to relate to in my world. Another great book...even so. Can't wait for the next one."
4,A promise worth keeping--and sharing.,"Heaven bless Richard Paul Evans for writing the kind of books that you not only enjoy reading yourself but that you can safely give as a gift--to you mother, grandmother, ANYONE--without feeling uncomfortable about some of the content.I loved it, and I know my mom will, too."
2,Didn't lose interest...or the urge to puke...,"The Story story was just interesting enough to keep me reading, but I have never been so thoroughly put off by the protagonists of a story. Everything was so perfect about Eliana and Ross that I found them way too contrived/artificial, although supposedly based on a couple of bona fide homo sapiens, and certainly exceedingly boring. I have to wonder if the author didn't use the same device - the ""real life"" fictional interview - that others have used to try to make the story seem more true-to-life; even with this, or even if the entire story were true, it's not much of a story. At least the studly Ross's capacity for 70+ consecutive push-ups was explained by his exhaustive physical training regimen while he...uh...had nothing else to do. Glad I bought the book at a clearance store."
4,Enjoyed thoroughly,"I appreciated the way in which Richard Paul Evans incorporates Italian proverbs with the start of nearly each new chapter. These thoughtful proverbs echo wisdom and experience, and they certainly apply to any love story... allowing the reader, even if it is just for a second, to break away from the act of reading the story itself and muse about what it means to be in love."
1,The last promise,I never got this book. I am still researching if I paid for it or not. I also received an email for another used book that I ordered and did not get saying that I would receive a $4.00 refund. Never got it either. Not a fan.
1,Disappointing,"DISAPPOINTING! I was so disappointed after I read this book that it had no uplifting moral values that the past books have had. I looked forward to buying this book to share once again at Christmas but not this year. The story was lagging ... How unfortunate! As for this reader, this will be THE LAST, ......PROMISE!"
5,A Great Read,As with all R.P. Evans books this one will not disappoint. Easy read and well worth .A bit of history in this one as well as the typical Evan's romance.
4,The Last Prtomise,"I read this book yesterday when my electricty we\as off for 8 hours. Thank God for my Kindle, I enjoyed this book. It gave me an insight into another culture and their ways. Richard Paul Evans is one of my favorite authors."
4,Wonderful story,"This was a great, easy read. I love the way this author writes! When I get into one of his stories, I can't put it down."
5,A Finely Crafted Novel,"Richard Paul Evans' ""The Last Promise"" is a finely crafted novel...one which holds the reader's interest, creating an underlying feeling of suspense. Even though there are no murders or other crimes woven into the story... no 'who-done-it' theme; it is nonetheless a gripping and spelling-binding tale. It may be considered a ""woman's story,"" but--as in the case of Nicholas Sparks--good writing, GREAT writing! isn't restricted by gender.--Ron Howe / Erskine, Minnesota (rchowe@gvtel.com)."
5,A Deeply Felt Romance,"It was easy to become wrapped up in the push and pull of these two people trying to find and hold onto each other. This love story contains some beautiful moments... and memorable moments make Richard Paul Evans' latest release a fun read. I found that I really wanted to get lost in Italy myself. Having traveled briefly in Northern Italy in the past, Mr. Evans' intricate desciptions of the landscaped had me longing to return. I enjoyed the little Italian lessons along the way!"
1,A disappointment,"My Italian boyfriend gave me this book for christmas. The plot seemed promising. However, before getting to the first page, we started to find errors.For starters, see ""acknowlegments"" second page---John Pitanzo, buon fortunata (sic) with your book. We decided to ignore it. Sadly, the errors became rather too common. Many of the proverbs in Italian contained grammatical errors. We wonder why the author didn't ask one of the numerous friends he acknowledges to correct his Italian. The story did prove to be interesting, but the errors created too much of a distraction. We expected more from a published work and don't recommend this book."
5,The Last Promise,"This book is great. If you want a steaming love story, this is it. Richard Paul Evans writes books where you feel like you are in real life in the story. This is our fourth book we have read. ""The Walk"" series are great books also. You won't regret ordering these books. I can't wait to read the next one. Page turner books for sure. I always order from Amazon. I have never had to wait long for an order. Very prompt. Donna Sharrits"
5,maria feliz beautiful movie- la enamorada,Ilove this movie maria felix and pedro almendariz do a outstanding job on this movie and of course maria felix being one of the most beautiful actresses of all time makes this movie a must see!
3,"Not Bad, Not The Best","I enjoy sleeping to the various Magic Moods CDs. Of all the ones I have, this one is the one I can't sleep to. Some of the birds have a piercing squawk that's not going to let you sleep. I find that this one is not edited as well as some of the others. Still, it's not all bad. I don't regret having it in my collection but it is the least played of my collection."
2,Ego trip,"I bought this book because I thought AJ was interesting the first time I saw him on Howard Sterns E show. Since then AJ has been on Howard a lot and is really repetitive. He's gotten laid a little bit, he has hung around celebritys here and there. Who cares. The book is just AJ feeding his ego. AJ is a sick guy. He is going through his mid life crisis and really wants desperetely to be famous. He tells boring stories about how great he is ""Look at me, look who I'm friends with"" ""Look who I slept with"", ect. ect. I expected a lot more outta this book. I did however read it from cover to cover but then I threw it in the trash which I rarely do with a book. I had a couple of friends who were mildly interested in it but I told them I would be wasting there time by giving it to them. Don't buy this book, it is horriable. AJ is a nerd with an inferiority complex who has built up a self worth larger then New York City. Don't buy this book and hopefully he will go away and be by himself."
1,We All Agree,"It seems everyone here all agrees that this is a lousy book and that A.J. Benza's life is rather disgusting or at least unimpressive. ""Z"" in the review 'Tedious Reading' says it all best. I had all I could do to finish it and did so quickly. He sure likes to talk about drinking and popping pills. The one real reason I spent the one penny it cost me for the book was in the hopes that there would be some photos of him which there were. I will give him this much credit. He is a handsome man."
1,"Thank you Amazon reviewers for saving me ""one penny""!",... Thank you Amazon customers for reviewing this piece of trash. You saved me from buying it for a penny. I've been eyeing this book since it came out... I remember AJ's spot on E and thought it would be a fun read... I was obviously very wrong. Now that I think about it... I have'nt seen AJ in YEARS!!!
1,Tedious Reading,"Having liked Benza's style on ""Mysteries & Scandals"" I picked up his book, and could not wait to finish it, and throw it away. Now, I'm not a sensitive soul, but it seems like every fourth word is ""F-this"" and ""F-that. But more about that later.""He is very frank and honest about how much of a no-talent person he really is, and goes to show that by his being in the right place, and at the right time, kissing the right behinds, and having ONE person in the ""inside"" pushing for you, anyone can be a famous TV Celebrity. And it's okay if you get fired, because once you are ""famous"", there's always another job lined up. Just ask Danny Bonaducci."
1,AJ Who?,"AJ Borza is as boring in print as he is in real life. A nobody trying so desperately to be somebody, but failing misearbly. Fame is something the no talent Borza will never have so there is justice in the world. Go ahead and buy this book because he needs to money to pay his rent now that he has been fired from three jobs in two weeks. And now, Mr. Borza, we return you to your regularly scheduled anonymous life...bahahahahahahahahahaha!"
2,slight,"If Benza knew the impression he gives, compared with the impression he THINKS he gives, he'd be embarrassed."
2,Average at best&that's a Compliment,A.J. Benza is like a Fast Food Place that says 98.9 percent fat free&Grease.but you still have that 1.1 Percent Grease&Chunk in there well that is Benza.He offers nothing new but a Generic Substitute to what He already is Offering.His E Reporting&Side Gig is far better than a Book on Him.He is a trip but nothing more.
1,Poor nailer,I bought this nailer for light moulding work in a mobile home. It was not worth my trip to home depot. It will not penetrate the wood I had to use a punch to finish them.
3,Adequate,Used on quarter round. Surface was not flat so that the driver was not able to drive all the brads completely into the target. Had to counter sink all nails.
1,Tried hard to make it work,"Got this from HD and it worked fairly good for an afternoon. When it was working I still had to use a nailset to bury the 5/8"" in soft pine, regardless of whether I held the nailer firmly with both hands. I figured that was ok considering the price of the gun. But then it started misfiring and then reapeatedly jamming.After a lot of frustration I took it back and exchanged it for a new one. I really wanted this to work!Sadly, the second one performed just like the first one, and I ended up buying some brad nails and hammered them in to finish my project.Good thing HD is close and they do refunds cuz this is going back."
1,Do Not Buy This Piece of Junk!,"Do not waste your money or time buying this item, it will not last. We purchased one from Amazon to put up pine trim in our kitchen. It shot 6 brads before malfunctioning and did not work again. We then purchased a replacement at a local home improvement store, so we could finish our project and the same thing happened. Our kitchen lights flickered each time we pulled the trigger, as well. Total piece of junk. We wasted our time and money, buy a real nail gun or use a hammer, you will have a better result."
1,Big Disappointment - Waste of Money,"I bought this nail gun to use to install base molding and do some light cabinet work. The nail gun was not powerful enough to sink the 5/8"" brad nails or the 1 1/4"" brad nails completely into trim or pieces of dimensional pine. The gun left most nails about 1/16"" above the surface requiring a nail set to set them completely. Additionally, the nails tended to bend when set by hand. I would not recommend this product for any use."
1,Disappointing Power,"I agree with the review above. The tool needs more power. I work on oak, and cannot get the 1"" or 1 1/4"" brads to penetrate fully. I tried 2 hands and putting my weight into it, but still no good. The nails are very difficult to set by hand as they bend easy. When I tried to remove the brad, it would snap in half! Very disappointing, since the tool appears to be good quality and it never jams.I contemplated buying a pneumatic nail gun or a cordless nailer. The pneumatic is cumbersome and the cordless is expensive. I'm going back to using my nail spinner, hammer, and nail set."
1,Failed my initial test...,"I bought this nailer at a local home depot only because the reviews weren't good and I figured if it didn't work well I could quickly bring it back...Good thing I did. I bought it along with one box of each of the size brads it used. Took it out of the case, and figured I'd try out the longest brads (1 1/4"") figuring if they worked, it was good to go. I tried it on a peice pine (soft wood). I wasn't able to get one brad all the way into the wood. There was typically 1/4"" of the brad left to be hammered in. No matter how I tried it just wouldn't sink the brad. So, I immediately took it back. Too bad, I'd love it if it just worked!"
3,Better than the 100,"It drives brads into most woods but you still have to have a hammer and nail set to finish the job. Using both hand as shown in the literature helped. I used it on baseboard and door frame. If you have an air driven nail gun, which I don't, don't buy unless there is no electricity where you are going to use this gun"
1,Not worth the plastic it's made of.,"I am sorry that I did not read the other reviews before purchasing this item. I would not even give this one star for a rating. The first one I had worked fine through one loading of brads. The following day, I loaded it again and got one shot out of it, then nothing.I returned it and got another one. This time it made it through one and a half lines of brads, laid it down to do something else, smelled something burning, looked at the nailer and there was smoke coming out of it. I wasn't even using it at the time. So I will be returning this one for a refund. Arrow staplers have been around longer than I can remember and I'm 53 years old and they have always had quality products. They really need to do something about this gun. It is not only junk, what if I had been in another room for a longer time and a fire had started? It needs to be removed from the shelves as a safety hazard."
1,People this Arrow Fastener is really a POS,"Folks, only purchase this FASTNER GUN if you intend on ATTEMPTING to fasten jello to a very soft piece of balsa wood and even then you should have your hammer close at hand!! You will be driving every brad to flush (the hole idea behind shooting brads is to not have a hammer mark, the brads are supposed to drive slightly below [ say 1/32 inch] and should not have to use a punch to drive them below wood surface)to wood surface without using a punch. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Arrow Fastener ET200 Heavy Duty Electric Nail Gun, shoots up to 1 1.4-Inch Brads9"
1,DUD,SIMPLY PUT THE STAPLER WAS DEFECTIVE FROM THE GET GO-FROM A SHOULDER HEIGHT ARM EXTENDED IT WOULD SHOOT A STAPLE 4 FEET-WOULD NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO PENETRATING WOOD. THEN IT JAMMED. I COULD HAVE PURCHASED A CHEAPER MODEL WHICH WAS MADE IN CHINA-I OPTED FOR THE MORE EXPENSIVE AMERICAN MADE MODEL?
1,2- time loser,"I bought2 of these items at home depot to add new base boardsand casings around my doors. Had to punch throughabout 1/2"" moldings. Worked fine until both siezed-upproduct can""t handle 1"" brads.Glad to see it yankedof shelves at home depot"
2,drivn4par,"I purchased my ET200 nail gun to do some molding and other light work while having my kitchen remodeled. I read the instructions, simple enough. So I did some practice nailing before doing the floor molding. I started with the 1.25"" nails. The first few shots left the nail exposed about .25"". Okay, press down harder, no difference. Try a softer wood, still left with .25"" exposed nail. So I reviewed the instructions, nothing there. Lets try the web page. Nice looking site but a serious lack of help. The FAQs' were canned to sell accessories. No real product support. I tried some smaller one inch nails and pretty much the same problem, but those 5/8"" nail gets driven in almost flush. I took the first back and tried another. It goes back tomarrow."
3,Ver 2 Seems OK,"I borrowed this tool from a friend. I am using it to nail quarter-round to baseboard with 1.25"" nails. So long as I remember to use two hands, pushing firmly against the work, it sinks the nails flush to the surface orslightly below. Downside is that pressing hard this way damages the wood, so it needs a larger surface to press against the work to reduce damage. I understand they sell a rubber 'bumper' for this purpose, but I have been unable to find one."
2,electric stapler,ok for very light use. i would save the money and purchase a better quality one and pay alittle more next time around. i will proubly sellthis one.
1,Arrow ET200 Sucks Big Time,"Bought one of these gizmos about 6 months ago to put up some crown molding. Since you need to use 2 hands to drive the nails (if you don't every nail will bend at about the halfway mark) you always need two people to install molding. It was a small job & I was able to get it done but still had to set about 1/2 the nails manually. Pulled it out again this week to insall some 1/4 rounds & it quit working after about a dozen nails were driven halfway into the wood. Since it was too late to return the defective T200 & being the enterprising person I am, I decided to go & purchase the same exact model & then return the old one with the current receipt. Arrow outsmarted me, the new T200 quit working after I put up 3 short pieces of 1/4 round. I think it burned up as I could smell an odor coming from the gun. Will be returning the new T200 asap. I would avoid this item unless you are looking for a painfull experience."
1,Fastener Unsuited for Purchase,I purchased this product to apply 1/4 inch pine wainscot boards. It could not fully shoot a 1-inch brad through the pine board into the backing materials. I had to finish each brad by hand with a hammer and nail set.Now the real reason to avoid this fastener--it's a piece of junk. The unit failed after shooting the 19th brad. It was totally inoperable after less than 15 minutes of use. It's dead. It's going back to Lowe's for a cash refund.
1,Poor product,"My experience with this product was very poor. We bought it at Home Depot and it just stopped working after about two dozen nails. We exchanged it for a new one, which gave off a puff of smoke and died after one use.I would not recommend it."
