2,Find a better head.,"Definitely not the smoothest panning or tilting available (important for video), but for what it is it gets the job done and supports heavier setups.It has been working great for everything else but like the other reviewer, I ran into a similar problem with a piece breaking: the panning screw plastic knob broke off so now I can't adjust how tight or loose I want the panning motion to be. Pretty disappointed, currently looking for a nice fluid head replacement."
5,Pure Pop for Non-Pop People,"If only this band had gotten the recognition lesser Texas bands like Tripping Daisy got.I've had this CD for years, and I never get tired of it. It still sounds fresh, the song writing is superb, and the playing exhibits that hardest-to-achieve of characteristics: making simplicity interesting and innovative. I can't recommend this CD enough. Plaintive, melodic vocals, clever arrangemens, and lots of clean, ringing electric guitar.Do yourself a favor; buy it. Then you'll tell your friends about it. It's a lost classic, and ten years from now, you'll still be playing it."
4,"Original, intelligent, fun music","Pop Poppins has got to be the best kept secret in music. Broose's lyric's are clever and original, frequently giving the listener a completely new view of a familiar subject. William P. Love's acoustic guitar can be amazing. On a Moving Train and On Top of a Building are both excellent...worth the price of a cd on their own. There's not a song on this cd that I can complain about, unless it's to say that I'm Alive frustrates me by ending after only 55 seconds."
1,"Apalling, beyond belief. NOT MIDDLE EARTH CUSINE","""Beer, cheese, pastry, a little win, good, simple food, none of that cuisine mystique"". A direct quote form J.R.R Tolkien himself.Dear Lord, what a travesty.The Food of Middle Earth, particularly the Shire, is specifically and unequivocally based on that of rural England in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries.No Garlic. No Shrimp. No chocolate or cocoa. No chili. No bison! No peppers.I was so very excited to see this book, and then, God, what wasted effort. This book is disgraceful. I hate to say it, I hate to be so critical of this womans efforts, but it has to be said. Do not buy it."
1,Middle Earth? Cosplay tragedy...,"Some call it a labor of love, and I am sure in the very small circle of the author's friends it is loved. But outside that circle? Don't be taken in, the recipes are not from middle earth -- there are barely half a dozen that even have connection to the books. The rest are created fan fiction supplements made by someone who thinks of themselves as a hobbit. Though I am sure hobbits never used milk powder.The recipes don't even attempt to be old English in nature, instead what you get is crappy american recipes with a loosely translated elvish name slapped on them.Don't waste the money! There are better free recipes available on the net!"
5,Regional Cooking From Middle-earth:Recipes of The Third Age,"I own this book, and it has most of my favorite recipes in it. I love the little twists on traditional recipes, which is what the introduction tells us. It's like being in Middle-earth. The author paid very close attention to what foods would have been available to the people who could have lived there, and the preparations were very traditional. I also liked the use of whole foods and the vegetarian options. It is a cookbook that anyone could use, and that's what makes it so much fun. It is the perfect gift."
1,Get EARLY ON (1964-1966) instead!,Rhino's EARLY ON compilation contains not only all of these songs but eleven other tracks from earlier sessions.
1,Recovery?,"I did not find anything helpful in this book regarding recovery.It seemed to me he was more intersted in promoting secularism then helping the alcoholic deal with an alternative to the 12 Step program.""Making Sobriety a Priority Everyday"" is what I think most alcoholics who want sobriety hope for until their addicted brain tells them otherwise. Those words are simply not enough to help one cope with the stuggle of sobriety.The author tells the reader what they need to do but does not give any helpful strategies on how to do it.Again, it seems that the author was more interested in hyping his secular philosophy.Also,the last 50 pages are a waste of paper. They were the reiteration of a journal entry for you to fill in each day. I think it was added to make the book look like it was longer and had substance.I hope this book can help someone but it most certainly did not help me."
3,Anglo-Jewish novelist's late conversion to Catholicism,"G B Stern's Rakonitz Chronicles are a droll entry into a large vibrant multi-generational cosmopolitan Jewish clan. Virago has republished the first two books in the series, originally published in the 1920's. A fun read, offering a view of Anglo-Jewish competent women innocent of what happened in the 1930's. So I thought All in Good Time, this late work written as a recent convert to Catholicism, would be interesting. Well, I couldn't quite finish it. It's embarrassing to follow such neurotic self-indulgent 'confessions' of a would-be saint who keeps telling us how far she is from sainthood... But it does throw some surprising illumination backwards on what she achieved in the 1920's in the fictionalized 'chronicle' of her ancestral clan."
4,Revenge,Revenge season 2 was very interesting and Amazon made it available to watch it without commercial interference. I recommend amazon for its price and availability.
3,Really this should only have lasted one season.,This could have been perfection if resolved in one season. So 2nd season somewhat disappointing as it naturally begins to strain believability.
4,Not bad...,"Normally I wouldn't touch a mainstream TV show with a 10 foot pole. I certainly wouldn't touch a mainstream TV show about snooty people who live in New England. I heard it was good, and one night because we where caught up with The Walking Dead...we started watching it....Not Bad..The Characters are interesting, the plot doesn't get boring, and we actually enjoyed it."
3,Confused,Between Season 1 and Season 2 Daniel and Amanda broke up? How did I miss that? Did I miss an episode of are we all in the dark?
1,This review is not about the episode....,I saw season one and I love this serie but the technical problems don't alow me to see this episode. I bought and I never can't see it..BIG TECHNICAL PROBLEMS....Bad review but for amazon instant video....doesn't work at all!!
1,Twin Peaks crash-and-burn scenario,"Season 2, episode 13 ""Reunion.""The acting is terrible, but I would suppose most people who watch this stuff already know this.The storyline is splintering even more. There will be no resolution as revenge is no longer the goal. A third season of nonsense is the goal."
5,Revenge,"Awesome show! However, I will stick to downloading my episodes from iTunes when needed. Amazon's instant video leaves a lot to be desired. The video kept freezing so a 45 min episode took almost 2hours to watch :("
2,What a Mess!,"Season one was very good. The writers seem to have lost their way. The plot is now incomprehensible. Too bad, but like many shows, it simply ran off the rails. Bizarre."
3,acttion,Well if you want to forget morales and see good acting.... go for it. I prefere morales. I just cant suport it
3,Becomes boring,The fact that there is a season 2 suggests this story will never get resolved - a new character or villain is always popping up. Season 1 was fascinating because you didn't know how it would end - well Season 2 suggests it never will and I find I am rapidly becoming bored.
3,Revenge,"I love the show, however, when the movie is in progress it kept freezing up. when it did this, the only thing I could do was to unplug the Roku from the circuit and start all over. this happened three times in a row."
4,Very Suspenceful,Wife really enjoys it. I like it enough to watch it with her and be entertained. A couples must see.
2,File keeps reloading,"Lots of problems with file reloading, and sound. When we watched Season 1 on Netflix, we have no problems at all."
2,"Liked Season One, Quit on Season 2","We enjoyed Season 1, although by the end were getting a little tired of some aspects. Hoped Season 2 would have new energy, but instead quickly gave up on it."
2,Revenge Season 2,Story line is all right but I couldn't figure out how to show Closed Captions on the down loaded versions from Amazon.
2,"The show is awesome, but.....",HD bogs down and you have to wait for it to catch up before the show resumes. We have watched the rest of the shows without HD because of that. Loved the clarity on the HD but it just didnt work.
5,Suspense,Really great if you are into looking at something with alot of foreshadowing and suspense. Revenge takes you on a roller coaster ride which starts off slow and then really speeds up.
4,Revenge,"It was very interesting, there was not a lot of bedroom scenes (as compared to Grey's Anatomy). The picture quality was very good. This is the best way to watch series, you don't have the commercial!"
4,Good show,"I like the new season, but I thought season 1 was a little better and more stream-lined. Still worth watching."
5,awesome show,love this show can't wait for the next episode to come out always something new happening on this show awesome
5,Best ever,"I'm a romantic comedy girl through and through. I usually refuse to watch anything else. I'm not exactly sure how I started watching this tv show but before the first episode was over I was hooked. This has got to be my favorite tv show that I have ever watched. I will watch this again and again and never get tired of it. It has something for everyone: Romance, drama, comedy, action, suspense... I hope this tv show has a long journey ahead of it. I would hate to see it end after only two seasons. I beg the writer/director to keep it up. Thank you for giving everyone such a great show. I haven't been this excited about tv in years. Great actors too"
4,Glued to it,"It has enough suspense that it kept me glued to it. Don't ask me why, at the moment I can't recall."
3,2 bucks to watch a missing tv show?,"I think 2 dollars to watch one episode is to much but I paid it since our DVR didn't record Resurrection. It's sad when you get caught up in a series you know isn't all that good but you want to know what you missed just in case the show gets better.Revenge is like watching any of the afternoon soaps, just one of the few that doesn't have anything to do with vampires. The acting is good/o.k. but the plot is wishy washy trying to find twists and turns to keep peoples interests.The best part is no commercials!! It's almost worth the two bucks not to have to watch the plethora of commercials !"
2,More Misfires,"While we are still fans of this series, the 2nd season is not up to the first one. Too many story lines , ridiculous twists in storylines, and not enough of Emily getting REVENGE like in season 1. And to add to disappointment, it seems as if another season with NO BLU-RAY. Watch it in HD but can't get the dvd's that way. Mind -boggling, ridiculous."
3,Revenge is Getting Old,"Good Lord...let's get this over with! Poor Girl! Move on to something more positive, please. There's far too much ""sleeping around"" for me to continue enjoying the show."
4,"Liked the service,BUT","Very pleased with the availability of all the episodes, without commercials. BUT, the last episode we viewed was almost painful. The show disconnected and reloaded 4 times, each time took 3-5 mins. It took 75mins to watch a 42min show. If that episode had been the first we watched, it would have been the last."
5,Always intriguing,This series really moves at a very fast pace and keeps me intriguied and awaiting the next episode! Love this series!
3,Revenge Season 2,Revenge Season 1 was very good but Season 2 is getting complicated with so many characters and everyone is plotting againsteach other. It's becoming less real.
5,This is one of my five star favorite shows,One of the things I love about this show is that each episode never fails to intrigue and leaves you wanting more.
5,Revenge Season 2,"After looking all over to get up to speed on this series, I found Amazon Online Video... Wow what a find I made. I found season 2 and was caught up in no time with the latest chapters and am now up to date and have now gotten my husband and my grand daughter caught up in the series.. I have watched some of the episodes a couple of times and they are still great to watch. Love the ability to catch up with the episodes that I missed..."
4,entertaining...,some good plot twists.. and very beautiful folks!! worthwhile if you have to watch a chic flick with the misses..
4,Not As Intense as Season 1,"I really like this series. Season 1 was a little more intense then season 2. For a change, it's the money people messing over other money people instead of sticking it to the little person."
3,Revenge Season 2,The quality in streaming is excellent. The storyline is a bit slow too many repeats from last season break-up get back together. It more like a day time soap opera.
2,Not as good as the first season,I'm always disappointed when a TV show starts out with a fantastic first season and then fizzles in the second. It's almost like all of the creative energy was used up making the first season and then there's nothing left. Or maybe they just ran out of things to say. Either way it looks like it's happening with Revenge and I'm pretty bummed. Looks like I have to find a new favorite show.
2,"corny show, tate donovan is too over the top and the female lead character is too inconsistent to be a sympathetic character","No one in this thing seems believable. I watched like two episodes and then started watching Deception. Revenge is too contrived, but it seems to be doing OK on tv. To each their own."
3,revenge isn't always better the second time,"I like this show but now in the second season it has a Dallas feel, I am waiting for the ewings to move in next door and start drilling for oil. But I guess it is an evening soap."
5,Best series!,"This is the best series I have seen in a loooong time! Amazing cast, and the series plot keeps you on the edge of your seat!!"
5,Awesome,Great show with good story lines keep you on the edge of your seat can not wait for next episode
3,Not bad.,"The first season of Revenge was better but the second was pretty good. A bit ""over the top"" at times."
5,Can't Wait !!!!,"Accidently "" Missed"" the last episode.... and THANK YOU Amazon, for having it so fast.....This is truly a "" Tangled Web"" and so close to the truth... the average person, just does NOT realize... Money is NOT all it is cracked up to be"
3,Not quite as good so far as season 1,This season is much more predictable than season 1 and some of the new plots not as interesting. Still worth watching compared to other series on tv. Maybe second half will be better.
4,pretty decent show,"started watching based on my wife's recommendation. Not the greatest show out there but def pretty solid. Sometimes feels a little dragged out. With what is out there on tv now, I would def consider it"
4,love this show,"I started watching this series at the end of season 1, but was able to catch up during the break w/reruns. I love this show! I'm kinda bummed that I had to pay for this episode, but as with the other ones, it was pretty good. Please, please find a way for prime members to be able to watch TV shows for a lesser price. Then it would be a perfect end!"
4,Fast and Easy,We enjoy this series and had missed taping two of them. Nice way to catch up without breaking the bank.
5,Freaking Amazing !!!!!,I just LOVE this show and the characters are just fantastic !!!!! I'm waiting patiently for a new episode :-).....
5,Great Twists and Turns!,I can never guess what is going to happen next. The writers are great at building in sneaky twists and turns to always keep you guessing. The sets are amazing too!
4,love love this series!,"I love the mind bending, back stabbing antics that these people do. Great entertainment if you like trying to figure out what will happen next!!"
3,Meh,"Not as good as Season 1. Season 1 had Emily laser-focused. Season 2 so far, I'm not appreciating as much."
2,Flawed video,"I knew I was buying a used video, but the quality was listed as good. About a quarter of the way through the movie, there was a fuzzy band that moved across the screen blurring the screen and the audio about once every minute. I am a teacher and can no longer get this video from my local library so I decided to buy it. There was not time to send it back after I previewed it the night before I used it and get a new one. I had to use it and it was very distracting to my students, and almost not worth showing it. I am very dissapointed; this video was in no way in good condition."
4,Stoked,The movies were awesome on the big screen but only OK on DVD. I picked this up after upgrading to blu-ray in the living room. I love to quality of the video the blu-ray offers versus the DVD version.
5,Must have for any HD-DVD owner,"So obviously the Metrix Trilogoy is one of the better movie franchises in sci-fi genre ever created. In HD it is a whole new expierience! I have never seen such clarity. Sometimes HD movies just don't seem like such a huge improvement but with this boxset you will see it, it's shoved in your face :) The Matrix - lobby-shoot-out is jaw dropping. The freeway chase from Reloaded... you won't believe how close Trinity comes to some of those cars on her Ducati! Revolutions... well that is the 3rd and in my opinion worst movie. The assult on Zion will blow your mind apart with all of the detail you can now see. Passing on this set would be a mistake."
5,Great series.,"The whole Matrix series I think is outstanding. The affects are amazing, and I am a computer geek so I really enjoy this movie, lol."
5,Excellent Box Set!,"When the Matrix was originally released on standard DVD, it was the movie that most people used to showcase their home theater set-up. It's only fitting that The Matrix once again helps usher in the new standard for the nex-gen format. For anyone that has been hesitant to jump into the new DVD format, this box set will make you a new convert. The films look and sound spectacular and are each loaded with extra content from the original release. A MUST have collection."
5,Enjoyment .,Spectacular service and product availability keeps me coming back & telling others. Amazon is the first choice for me and my family & friends. Great Job.
5,Phenomenal,"I ordered my copy as soon as it was available to pre-order. Amazon shipped it May 22, 2007 and I received it May 24, 2007 with free shipping. This Box Set did not disappoint. The picture is absolutely phenomenal and the audio is even better. The Complete Matrix Trilogy on HD DVD is worth every penny."
4,awsome movie,The matrix trilogy is one of the finest and greatest sci-fi movie to come out of hollywood. The first installment was sufficient and the best among the three but I enjoyed the other two too. It is a science fiction on the surface but philosophy is bountiful and seems influenced by buddhism and hinduism (not the mythology though). The much stylized action sequence is jaw dropping. dolby true HD audio is mindblowing. It is a true cinematic experience.
5,Great Action,"I'm not necessarily an action movie fan, but I do like Keanu Reeves. He's one of those actors who have longevity and should bearound for a long time. I had a hard time following some of the story - I felt lost in many areas, but overall, it was a good story. Ifound that I did have to think about this movie more than I like to. When I have to do that it takes away from the pure enjoymentof a movie which is what I really want, but it has Keanu Reeves in it and that's what is necessary."
5,Good Trilogy,"The first movie didnt have the HD QUALITY i thought it would, but the 2nd and 3rd DO NOT LET DOWN!!!i like the first and second one but the 3rd one, while not bad, is alright. i guess it does its job in ending the trilogy.great demo material to show off your HD telivsion and Player...again, THANX AMAZON!!"
5,nothing better,"The Complete Matrix Trilogy is what it is... a compilation of the 3 movies... which to me, were incredible... nothing better."
4,Nice,"Good collection and amazing pq, but I dislike WB for what they did to HD DVD.I'll never buy another Warner Brothers DVD/HD DVD."
2,No Animatrix!?!,It said it came with the animatrix dvd but all I got was a coupon to download it from xbox live that had expired in 2007. Should have splurged on the blue ray.
5,Mind Blowing!,INSANE VIDEO AND SOUND. THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT HD DVD CAN DO!I LOVE MY HD DVD!!!!
5,The Matrix HD Resolution...,"The Matrix Trilogy is an awesome experience in terms of the visual technology used and in HD is something else. I have the original Trilogy and the difference in terms of colors is awesome.I recommend it, it looks amazing."
1,hd dvd?,"I bought this product for a friend's son for XMAS. It is advertised as HD DVD. It would not work on their HD dvd player or on their brand new gaming computer dvd player. Also, I had a new in box hd dvd player I lent them in an effort to turn this let down of a purchase into a success. The discs wouldn't play on it either. very sad."
1,Very Disappointed!!,I ordered this item as a Christmas gift and it didn't even work. There was nothing even on the DVD's. Then I ordered another set hoping to get ones that worked and the second ones didn't work either!
1,oops,"I have a high end dvd player w/ hdmi and was unable to view the videos and now I am stuck with them. when I sent the seller an email explaining this they responded by saying, if my memory serves me right, the movies will only play on a blueray and one other type of machine which I cannot remember now. My advice is to call them before hand to make sure your machine will play them."
1,Irratated,Gave this as an x-mas gift so i couldn't return it beacuse i order everything i gave for x-mas way in advance. I love the case this comes in but that's all it's good for for me at this time. I did not realize this was HD DVD and would not play in my DVD player so really it's my fault but beware and make sure you don't miss that HD DVD part on these porduct listings or you end up paying for it.
4,not bad but not the best,was hard to find the main menu for the discs on my bluray player but the picture quality was good and i am happy with the purchase
2,Thieves stole our trailer the first time we used it!,"We used this lock on our motorcycle trailer, and our trailer was stolen the first time we used it. The police said that the suspects in the area spray freon on these and they just snap with the hit of a hammer. The lock gives no protection from theft."
1,Master Lock 2847DATSC,"Gave all appearences of a good lock and bought two. But, strong pulling pressure and a simple twist and the body and shaft separate and come apart. No key needed to open. Complete failure as a lock."
1,How?,"How is this legal? These CD's are not commercial releases, they are bootlegs...last time I checked to sell bootlegs is illegal. I cannot imagine Pink Floyd or their management group or record company would be happy about this!"
4,A better barrier than most,"I purchased this item to keep my two messy toddlers from getting the majority of the bathwater on the floor. It does do a decent job at that; however, my one complaint is that the suction cups don't have the best stickability. They're easily pulled off the wall by my youngest.As long as the kiddos don't pull it down, this product does do its job pretty well."
5,This an excellent book,"If you want to know much better about the crusades and the background about their origins, you might need to read this book. Mrs. Regine is an outstanding researcher every time she writes a book."
1,Lacks systematic exploration of traditional anaylsis,"Carl Hodge's Trammels of Tradition reads more as an expose of subjective democratic interlude. Nowhere, does the book challenge the drastic changes in industrial technique, economy and social structure that have occurred in Europe between the nineteenth and the middle of the twentieth Centuries. The book fails to identify any feudel traits during these times. Hodge's view of democracy can only be certain under a Utopian guise without acknowledging its characterological changes of quantification and abstractification. In short, this reads extremely alienated and is ill-researched."
2,No Mysteries??,"Opening with a beautiful Ave Maria, I was hopeful about this cd. I have listened to many many rosary cds. Only 5 decades of the rosary are prayed without a mystery even briefly being announced.A beautiful Marian hymn is sung after each decade and beautiful background music accompanies the saying of the ""Hail Marys"" and ""Our Fathers"". Angelic I might add, some of the best Ive heard.After the 5 decades are prayed, other Marian hymns and prayers are sung. And yes they are beautiful. But is this the rosary? I think not.It is soothing and beautiful but..... the ""Prayer of the Church""??.....absolutely not.Fr McGinnitys rosary (Medjugoria)is my very favorite. There is no music but you know youve prayed from the heart in this one. Good Luck trying to find it."
4,Prayer of the Church/ The Rosary,"This is the second time I purchased this item as gift for friends. Good record, great sounding and clear stage. Will recommend to friends."
2,bent bars,"got the bars on time, cut the ends off , because i needed them narrower, went to mount them and saw that they were not straight, the top bar is not parallel with the mounting area, couldn't return them because i all ready cut them( my fault i guess), but i guess they should have came made right!"
4,History Of Skyscrapers,"This is one part of a five-part series entitled ""Building Big.""View rare footage of the Empire State Building's construction, and learn what drove one of the building's contractors to a nervous breakdown. The Empire State Building was the tallest building of its time.See the construction of the Eiffel tower.See the building of the tallest building in the world in Malaysia.Learn of the near collapse of the Citicorp Center.Learn of the many construction techniques that go into building the tallest buildings in the world.Documentary (Wallingford 324/1)"
3,as described but..,"As someone who has raised deer, I find the call to sound more like a duck than a doe bleat contact call. With enough practice it could be made to sound like a panicked fawn, but generally you could do better with your own vocal chords. This pretty much applies to most doe bleat calls I've tried and is not limited to this one. It's pretty enough for my wall display and cheap enough for my daughter to play with, so it's no loss. ;)"
5,Exactly what I needed,"I had a starter element go bad on my Ducane grill. This assembly installed easily, and fixed my problem. Shipping was quick. Would definitely buy again!"
1,not what is advertised,"I returned the first package because it was missing half the parts and the tube of lube.... The replacement Amazon sent was missing parts & the lube too. Only enough parts for one wheel & no lube.Sent the second package back for a refund.The product photo clearly shows enough parts for two wheels & a tube of brake lube, and states it is a ""kit"". (Nothing saying you must purchase TWO ""kits"" per vehicle, at 2x the cost.)Maybe someone in the packing room dosen't understand that, or has even looked inside the Raybestos box to see what they are shipping? Or is it false advertising? .... Anyway it would certainly upset anyone waiting on these parts to complete a brake job to only get half the parts needed!Thank you to Amazon to making it super easy for their returns, (first time was a replacement, which came super fast!... 2nd time I've asked for a refund)....Now to see how the refund goes... hopefully they will handle that as smoothly as they do the rest of their operation!!!:)."
4,Y DO WE ALL HATE GOOD CD'S????!!!,for all you haters up there this is a good CD i dont know what you are talking about and i dont think you know! i love this CD !!!!!!
2,this isn't the soundtrack,"Where is Motorhead with 'The Ace Of Spades'? What about CKY or The Red Hot Chili Peppers? Where did Sum 41 come from, they weren't on the soundtrack?I've given this 2 stars because of Deftones, NOFX and Pennywise, but really, they could have done better with this."
2,not that great,i only recomend this for some bubblegummer who wants to ruin rock and punk at the same time. i mean you got your deftones and you got your nofx and pennywise good bands from the rock scene but then you get your paparoach and sum41? both bands that are turning metal and punk into a pop sensation. i think this cd draws kids in with its relation to the video game and mainstream bands only to get them familiar with other bands that are good that kids are gonna make popular intill the band sells-out. AND THE CD DOESNT HAVE THE DEAD KENNEDYS FROM THE FIRST GAME! if you like sum41 and all those mtv bands buy this but if you like good bands like nofx and pennywise just download the few good songs that are on here from a warez site or buy the cds of the band.
2,"Great Game, Bad Soundtrack","If you are a fan of Tony Hawk games you know that they have great soundtracks. This one, screwed up. There are some unknown songs on there and the CD is missing the games best songs. Advice? If you love Tony Hawk, listen to the game itself. Not the Cd. Personaly, I think it is OK. Its just the fact that I wanted a soundtrack of Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3."
1,POSER PUNK BANDS. . . TOO MUCH METAL!!,"This Cd only has 2 tracks from the video game. Also, unless you like some metal. . . and (...) Papa Roach... Don't buy this!!!Never...Ever buy a CD with this high of a price...just buy a punk compilation CD like: Thought Remains the same, Punk-O-Rama 6 or Life in the Fat Lane...OVERALL THIS CD COULDN'T (be) ANY WORSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Where's the NEW Music?,"Ok: We all know that if someone expects a soundtrack to sell good, it needs NEW music, not music taken from already released albums! I suggest you only get this for the bonus CD rom."
1,there are better options,I bought one of these from a different vendor. I think it was Amazon and the price was less than $50. I installed it on a motorcycle and it worked for 2 hours. One of the pins on the bulb broke off- seemed to be defective as it couldn't handle the vibration of a few hours of driving. Anyways the bulb is a sealed unit and costs $40. I should have returned the whole thing to Amazon but I initially thought they would balk at replacing a bulb. My feeling is it is a bad deal when it costs nearly as much to replace the bulb as buying new. I have PIAA 2000's on another vehicle which use H3 bulbs. The PIAA H3 bulbs are expensive at $20 a piece but there are at least cheaper options. PIAAs are usually nice but these are just no good when you have to pay $40 when the bulb blows out. At that price the housings should be called disposable.
4,Shut yer yaps and read dis!,"Remember when comic strips ruled the land? Little Orpan Annie, Flash Gordon, Terry and the Pirates, Derby Dugan...what, you don't remember Derby? Feisty little Sluggo-lookalike, quick tempered, possessor of the magic wallet? Of course you don't remember; he's a fictional creation in this wonderful Depression-era novel by Tom De Haven. Narrated by Derby's writer, the novel captures the flavor of New York City when everyone was reading the funnies, and the many characters inhabiting the city were just as colorful as the strips themselves. Featuring a cover and sample strip by famous Maus creator Art Speigleman, you'll believe you're reading about a real comic strip and its authors...not just the invention of a crafty and gifted writer. A great book"
5,Classic nursing films,Great condition-new quality. Arrived on time. Was very well received by many nursing faculty members. Hit of the nurses week event!
3,try a different prep method,"this mat is very similar to cooling wraps (bandannas,foot/wraps)I use for MS problems. Soak the mat, hang it until dripping stops, then wrap & roll very lightly in a towel. The mat will feel dampish, use an old thin towel over it if your pet is reluctant to lie on it. It will provide cooling for about 36 hours."
2,It Doesn't work,"I got this for my dog in medium and large. It doesn't work. It absorbs the water and swells and by evaporating cools my doggie. Well, it's not dry here so it doesn't work and fido doesn't like lying on something that's wet."
2,What were they thinking?? Film's focus is sadly lacking,"This one gets 2 stars for the cast and a few of the bits that work (Virna Lisi and Raquel Welch scenes come to mind) but, you do have to wonder what was going on in the minds of the director, scriptwriter, studio execs, etc., not to mention Burton, as they made it. As a college student, I saw it in a theater filled with an audience that made every effort to take it seriously, as a thriller. I laughed loudly at one point and the person in front of me turned around and glared. Did the makers mean it to be camp? scary? What? The film doesn't seem to know it's point of view either. Richard Burton is a brilliant actor but, if this performance is the only one you've seen, you might find that statement hard to believe."
3,What about the animals?,"Yes, this movie is very campy. However, for those who are animal people, don't watch the beginning of this film. There's a hunting scene in which you see real animals being shot to death. It's a quick moment, however, it's disturbing for those who are not into pointless murder.The movie is campy/awful. It starts off as a serious film, then turns into a Mel Brooks adaptation, then back to serious. For example, one of his wives was always singing, and that's why he killed her. Another was an ex-nun. The bodies of his wives are nothing more then window display manniquins. I wouldn't call this Burton's best work by far."
5,This is a great art and erotic film,"I loved Joey Heatherton's performance. I strongly agree with the cover which says ""Richard Burton stars in this fantastic tale with some of the most beautiful women in cinematic history, including Raquel Welch and Joey Heatherton"" (and some fantastic European actresses such as Virni Lisi, Nathalie Delon, Karin Schulbert, Agostina Belli, and Sybil Danning). ""Baron Kurt Von Sepper (Burton) is an Austrian aristocrat who lives in austere obscurity in a large castle. He has married his seventh wife (Heatherton), to whom he seems ardendly attached. One day, she finds a mysterious golden key which gives access to a secret passage where she finds her husdand's previous wives. It is then that the Baron recounts to her the horrid and bizarre details of his past. It remains to Heatherton to fight for her survival and to avoid becoming just another beautiful frozen body."" I strongly recommend this movie."
1,Richard Burton should have been shot for this one,This film is so bad it makes the Exorcist II look like a masterpiece. The only thing that saves this horrible film are the many beautiful women it has. I cannot express how utterly repulsive this film is and how sad it was for me- a big fan of Mr. Burton to watch it. Now I understand why many critics have called Mr. Burton a sad waste of talent. Not only is this an example of wasted talent but rather an example is pure creed and stupidity. How could he follow Virginia Wolf? Becket and the spy who came from the cold with this garbage. One word money.
5,"Dance Scene Music ""De Bu Dao De Ai Qing""","The music from the Very (and I Mean Very) romantic dance scene with Situ (Lie Ye) and Yiling (Wonderful Bingbing Li) is listed in the film credits as ""Could Not Get Your Love"" -- However it is available on Amazon MP3 under the title of ""De Bu Dao De Ai Qing (This Love is Not For Me)"" sung by Yao Lee It is sold as a remix and as the best version which is the original. This dance scene, and music is extremely moving -- especially when the following story is revealed. After much looking I have not been able to find the music from the final ""dance"" scene with Cynthia (Equally Wonderful Zhang Ziyi) and Itami (Toru Nakamura). The film credits list it as ""The Moon Of A Garden Bridge"" sung by Utako Matsushima. If anyone knows where it is available or the Chinese title please post it. Thanks BC"
5,Ziyi shines - again!,"This is just a really cool movie! The cinematography is great and Zhang Ziyi is her usual breathtaking self. The 122 min runtime never left me bored for a second, mainly because I was always trying to figure out what was going on - not feeling befuddled or frustrated, but enjoying trying to untangle the story."
3,GREAT GOSPEL ALBUM!!!,"I think this is a Great album for Brandy's father, I can see exactly where Brandy & Ray J gets there talent from. I have the song wit Brandy and Willie singing a duet on repeat I think that is definitely the best song on the album. If you're into Gospel i recommend you to buy this album, it's a great album."
5,This is a useful book for high school freshman.,I was surprised to discover how many common proverbs and phrasesare confounding to high school freshman. This book has helped me to better understand the cultural awareness that thesestudents have not yet acquired. It has also been a usefultool for working to bridge that gap.
5,All you ever wanted to know,"A refresher course for all the names and dates fromhigh school. I bought it because i was in an improv acting classand it behooved me to know all the references people were making,and to add my own trivia too."
5,Best book ever,"I had the first edition and now the second edition is equally as enlightening. This is a valuable book,"
4,Mostly good,"This collection has some great songs. I think the best is ""Redeemer, Savior, Friend"" because you can tell that the lady singing it really means every word. It is a very sweet song, good for singing when you are spending quiet time with the Lord. I also like ""Lord I Lift Your Name on High"" and ""Shout to the Lord."" There are some great upbeat songs like ""My Redeemer Lives"", ""Every Move I Make"", and ""Awesome God"" (very gospel sounding!). I give this CD only 4 stars because there are a lot of very slow songs. I particularly prefer fast songs, something with a good beat, but that is just me. I do recommend this as a part of anyone's worship collection! :)"
5,Awesome listening for the whole family!,"From my husband and me at 30+ down to the 18 month old baby, we all love this CD! The kids ask to listen to ""Na-na-na"" (reference to Track #3 on Disc 1, ""Every Move I Make""). They want this CD in their rooms, in the den, and on the road. It goes everywhere we do! The sound of this music is hip and attractive to everyone, while also retaining a uplifting and worshipful attidude. I recommend this CD set for anyone and everyone!!"
4,We Speak to Nations,"Number # 12 on this three CD set is awesome!It is entitled, ""We Speak to Nations"". We sing and worship with this song at our church, and it opens the heavens. The words to this song declare Nations to be Saved and come into the kingdom of GOD. THe Lady singer for this song is annointed and when she sings you feel the presence of the Holy Spirit. ENJOY!!!Also, our Dance and Kid Dance and Flag team at church have coreographed a special to ""WE SPEAK TO NATIONS"".THis song #12, is taking the nation by storm!"
3,Can be better,This book is a good entrance to the GSM world and can still serve as a quick handbook for GSM.But the main problem is with the additional unnecessary text that some times can distract the reader away from the technical point being explained.
2,A poorly written book,"Although this book gives the reader much useful information on GSM, the style is poor and and needs editing by Artech House. when I first read the book I got out my marker pen and delated large sections of useless text. The explanation of Channel Coding and Signalling, 5.14.4, started by saying 'The passengers (user data) in an airplane may have all paid full fare, the plane may be safe, and the accomodations exceptional, but nobody is going anywhere without the a pilot and crew (signalling data). The book is still in my bookshelf as it is a handy reference manual on GSM, but I am sure there are better books on GSM out there."
5,An introduction to GSM (The Artech House Mobile Communications),Detailed yet thoroughly understandable to moderately technical reader. Book purchased as used in good condition; actual condition excellent.
3,Great book for those new to GSM,"This book is great for technicial individuals who are new to cellular technologies. The authors do a good job of covering all of the layers in the GSM system. Some of the topics could have been rearanged a bit to give the book a more logical flow. Likewise, some of the diagrams could have been rearanged to keep the reader from having to turn multiple pages. Overall, this is a good book for beginers."
1,"I want my money back NOW, very disappointing","I ordered this book so maybe our choir could sing a couple of these songs. Nowhere in the title or description did it say this book was a piano solo book and would have NO WORDS. Even a piano solo book should have WORDS. If it had said there were NO WORDS, I would have bought it. I am going to see if I can get my money back."
3,Great voice....but...,"I waited a while for this one. I liked the way ""AM to PM"" sounded and this girl looks,acts, and sounds like a diva. HOWEVER, I really really don't like the songs with her featuring rappers. This CD is way more urban than I thought. I'd have prefered some spanish songs or remixes - especially since she's Cuban. On to the review: I really like ""when you look at me"". ""Twitch"" sounds like it could be Mya.""Until I get Over You"" is really pretty, but sad. It will make you cry. ""Thank you"" is beautiful also. Very pop, not R&B. ""You Make Me Laugh"" sounds good, is catchy.I guess I just hate ""Get Away"", ""Spending Time"", and ""A Girl Like Me"".But, she's a great singer. Way better than Beyonce who's winning the awards this year!"
1,I love Christina But her first cd is wack!,This is for Mister Music fan First of all you said this Cd is better than Christina Second I don't think so This cd was poped out and you said When you look at me was better than Whatever you want you must have been high when you wrote this reviewand Am to pm is no where near better than Dip It Low I telling all of you out there go get Christina's second cd it's killing this one all the way!
5,well worth the wait,This CD is one of the best CD's I have in my collectionit was suppost to come out OCT.19.01 but never did.This is the only place that I could get it and I finally got my copy after 2 years of wanting and IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!!! trust me
4,good cd,very good cd. this is the one of the only places you can get it as it was not released in the USA.
3,Should have been released in the US,"When I was younger I got the AM to PM CD Single and played the heck out of it, so I was really disappointed to find out it's release in the US had been canceled. That's where Amazon really came in handy. I finally received it and loved it. Now looking back on it, it was a pretty good debut. Some of the songs are really cheesy though. I really liked ""AM to PM"" and ""You Make Me Laugh"", but ""Twitch"" was my favorite. I hardly ever listen to this CD anymore, but I think it was probably her best."
3,Not so sophisiticated,I purchased this cd thinking it was going to be a hot r&b album but it is not a hot r&b cd or pop cd. it's listenable but not worth buying. twitch is the best track along with the first track featuring ja rule. the rest is the usual poppy cliched music that is heard everyday.
2,Giants wear this jacket.,"I am solidly a size medium, but I was swimming in this jacket. I think it is more of an XL. I'd say the medium is for someone 5'10"" and 250lbs."
5,Wonderful and inspiring!!,"I am a senior in high school, and our English teacher shared this story with us, and had us to look for a deeper meaning. It is wonderful and inspiring. I want a copy so I can share it with my children one of these days."
4,Universal Appeal,"Dutch singing artist Rob De Nijs has a voice that is appealing, even if the songs are not performed in English. He has been a favorite of mine since stumbling across him out on the internet about fifteen years ago. As for this CD, I was even pleasantly surprised to find a cover song that I think most folks will recognize. One of these days, I really hope this fellow does an album in English!"
5,Patient reader rewarded,"After reading Chandler's Daughter a couple of years ago, I have been looking forward to Lexy Connor's next outing. I was not disappointed.Lexy Connor is renaissance woman who happens to play detective from time to time -- usually at the insistence of someone in her vast circle of acquaintances. Although she has the tenacity essential to the successful detective, she also has the ability to enjoy the scenery -- and the comradeship -- while in pursuit.Half the fun of a Lexy Connor story is her often wry comments on the situation, the protagonists, and herself. Her creator has the ability to evoke a clear, and often chuckle-worthy, image of a minor character with half a dozen words.Unfortunately, I now have to start waiting again -- not for quite so long this time, I trust."
4,Andrew Jackson,"As with the rest of the books I have read in this series, I found it to be very informative and non partisan. I find this a very effective way to learn of our presidents history without putting up with the bias of most bios. If I want to learn more I can simply buy another of that particular pres.Perry Thompson"
4,Not a hagiography; Not an uncritical assault,"The presidential biography is a genre fraught with perils. Many biographers lose their critical perspective due to excessive love for their subjects; others,driven by moral indignation, lose sight of the need for nuance. This is especially dangerous when dealing with figures as morally questionable as Andrew Jackson. Sean Willentz is nothing if not calm, critical and thorough in his examination of Jackson's legacy. While not as expansive as recent biographies, it is perhaps more level-headed (what better way to announce your intention of producing a hagiography than by entitling a Jackson biography ""American Lion""?). It also offers a good overview of the evolving perception of Jackson's legacy since his presidency."
1,Sterns Mad Dog Chainsaw Carrier Junk,Junk Junk Junk Ripoff!Hand tightening nut plastic broke off the first time I tightened it. It takes 2 men & 3 boys toget the saw in the protector then in the bracket. If you want to throw away money buy this item.1 star for fast shipping.
1,Not worth your trouble.,"The music is fine, but any Christmas album that does not include ""Silent Night, Holy Night"" is not worth your trouble. There are too many other Christmas albums to choose from."
1,"No politics, please","Cadogan Spain a is fine guide [I use it] blemished by spiteful, ill-informed political asides."
4,The best football game for the new Millenium,"Microsoft's NFL Fever 2000 is the best football game ever made. It has recieved Kick-Ass awards, surpassing EA SPORTS' Madden 2000. Although this is the first release, do not buy Madden for its reputition for $40. NFL Fever 2000 defeats Madden in every field- breath-taking graphics, over 500 motion captured animations and actual game sounds. Only drawback- there are no multiplayer options over a LAN or Internet. If you like NFL Blitz, you can change player properties (make them whatever you want), and can just thrash the opponent. Overall, this is the best game for the buck."
1,Diamond sharpener,I was really disappointed with this product it just doesn't work for me. I really should have sent it back. I have other diamond sharpeners that work fine but this one just doesn't do the job!! Bud@Bellcrest!!!
2,not 4 me,i own the same smiths product - in the wet/dry stone configuration - so i was excited to get the steel. only problem is that the rod doesnt work as well for me. dont think its a good choice for asian knives.the interrupted pattern along with the oval design rod means that the sharpening process is rough - not smooth across the rods surface. will return for a traditional diamond or ceramic steel.too bad because i think smith products are first class
4,Car driveside door mirror,Thank you for the quick servive. It was just what I wanted and want youpromised also at a good price.
5,Get this great Russian Music,"I have eyed this CD many times as I already had a few of the selections but not all of them. I am a big fan of Russian Classical so I recently bit the bullet and bought the CD and it is well worth more than the $11 price.Evgeni Svetlanov conducts with the USSR Symphony Orchestra and they are superb. In my opinion Svetlanov is the best Russian conductor. The pieces that I already had were better on this recording, and the pieces that I was missing are a great addition.Everything is incidental music from Glinka's operas so there is no singers or chorus. I especially like the ""Overture from Ivan Susanin"" and ""In Nian's Castle from Ruslan & Lyudmila"". They are seldom heard but very melodic and colorful. They alone are worth the price of the CD. On the other hand the ""Overture Ruslan & Lyudmila"" is very over played (I have 5 recordings now) but this is an excellent version and so still enjoyable.I suggest you get this CD."
3,All plastic,"I read the description and ordered these for a vintage dining room chair. I was trying to save money.They arrived on time but the package was open. Possibly during shipping since it was sent in an envelope.They seem to be the right size but they aren't going on my vintage chair. They are cheap, you get what you paid for.I think I paid more in shipping than the item price. They are all plastic, I believe the brass is just brass-colored plastic. I think I'll spend a little more and go with another type. I'll save these for a cheap chair. The instructions don't explain how to remove the old ones either, mine don't just 'slide off'."
5,Convincing,"After reading most of the popular literature available on Wittgenstein, I came across Logic and Sin. I cannot praise this book enough. It convincingly points to aspects of Wittgenstein's writings that have not yet been properly addressed by other commentators. Informed, inspired and fresh. I am in debt to the author for a truly moving analysis. I hope you will join me in appreciating this book. It deserves your attention. You will not read Wittgenstein the same way again."
5,A wealth of information,A step-by-step guide that takes you by the hand in the design and implementation of an HFC system. A must read for the broadband revolution. I've read it three times.
3,Published in 1995 - Out of Date,That's all there is to say.The book may be well written and may have been up to date in 1995 but it is now thoroughly out of date.In the opening chapter it talks about MPEG2 as a new technology and dismisses the digital transmission of video signals because of the high cost of encoders and decoders.The book also talks about ATM in the way everyone did in 1995 thinking it was going to extend to the desktop.Also take note that it is aimed at enterprises and educational institutions not cable operators.
5,A sensual story about discovering what makes us human,"Midnight Sunshine is an original novel by Kelvin L. Reed about an interracial relationship. Nathan, a lonely African-American man, and Marife, a beautiful Asian woman, have 90 days to learn whether they truly can be content with one another before they must either marry or separate forever. Midnight Sunshine is deftly written and highly recommended as a sensual story about discovering what makes us human and the eternal struggle to find love."
1,Pathetic,"I think Diane Rehm is a talented radio host. I appreciate that she has had a long and interesting career, however, being a radio host and being an author are definitely not one and the same. Ms. Rehm's revelations of insecurity, marital discord, marital sex, and the rest, felt just too embarassing. Her perspective is whiny and immature and completely uninspiring. I kept wishing I could have been a wise and dear friend that stopped her from writing this book.I shudder each time I think of her (literary) indiscretion."
1,Ugh,"Out of human compassion, I urge people who do not want to squander hours of their life to avoid this tedious, me-me-me book."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Diane Rehm is full of herself. During her long career at WAMU, she managed to amass so much power that she raised the money to make her own show national then she was able to hire her own boss, the former president of WAMU who turned out to be a disaster for the station and was forced to resign in disgrace. Now that we are celebrating her 30 year anniversary on the air, it would be a good time for her to resign. The station refers to her medical condition and wretched voice as a ""disability"". A radio host with Spasmodic Dysphonia is like a blind taxi driver."
3,"Good, but no education in bedtime","This is a good video, but there's nothing to learn from it. There's no education in bedtime. And the story line, in my opinion, was not very good as Red Light, Green Light which talks about traffic safety. All Aboard for Bed might work for you, but it didn't work for me."
2,Not the Best Big Comfy Couch Video,"My 3 year old daughter loves the Big Comfy Couch, but does not care for this particular video at all. I hate to say anything negative about the Big Comfy Couch, but for some reason they stuck an annoying ""hard rock"" style song into the middle of this otherwise cute video. Even Barney songs all have melodies that will eventually grow on you, but this rock song about interrupting is unbearable! Without this song, the video would be a 3 star video.I recommend sticking to all of the other great Big Comfy Couch videos that follow a variety format more like the TV show. The ""Are you Ready for School"" one is my daughter's favorite."
4,It's captivating!,My daughter who is 2 years old loves pretend play and this is one of the only TV shows that really fosters her imagination. Loonette talks about common feelings young people have and easy ways for kids to solve disagreements. My daughter really enjoys this video - over and over again.
4,My opinion about the Wiggle and a Giggle video,My sister which is 2-years old loves the Wiggle and a Giggle video she watches it everyday. My little cousin which is also 2 likes the video just as much when we went to buy one for her we noticed that everywhere we went to buy one didn't carry them no more. The hard rock song in the middle don't both either of them. They watch the show everyday and after that is over they even ask to watch the Wiggle and a Giggle video and they dance and have a good time while watching it. So in my opinion I don't think it is a bad movie and they enjoy it very much. They even wore the tape out watching it all the time.
1,NOT the Sesame Street video!,"The review already listed on the page describes the *Sesame Street* 1-2-3 Count with Me video. The video that arrived when I ordered from this page is a Big Comfy Couch video--not the same video at all, and not what the other review describes. Amazon only seems to sell the Sesame Street _1-2-3 Count with Me_ bundled with _Do the Alphabet_."
1,A Supposedly Fun Author I'll Never Read Again,"While some essays were entertaining, on whole I found this book to be quite annoying. The author tries to combine stuffy academic writing with popular non-fiction, with decidedly mixed results. For example, Wallace seems obsessed with footnotes (several of his footnotes have footnotes!) which disrupts the narrative flow on nearly every page of some stories. He also comes across as a whiny outsider; his stories about the state fair and life aboard a cruise ship reveal more about the author than about the subject."
2,not a funny thing at all,"i was recommended this book by a man i met in a pub in county kerry, ireland. He said it was great but when i got it home i couldn't belive how bad it was. how bad? as bad as bad can be."
2,Good stories but difficult to read,I found this writing extremely difficult to read and understand. The sentences were long and confusing and by the time I got to the end of a paragraph I struggled to follow the point. The stories were generally interesting but in the end I gave up because I found it too much work to carry on.
2,Worst thing I have read in a while,"Wordy and drawn out are two terms to describe this overbearing work by Wallace. It wasn't enertaining as much as it was tedious to get through. Footnotes, Lynch essay from hell, ""banal"", and ""w/r/t"" all overdone. The only redeaming essays are about the state fair and the cruise, where we the reader gain insight into the author's way of perceiving mundane aspects of life. But I suppose we could all be watching Seinfeld reruns instead. I will admit I skipped quite a few paragraphs in this book because the inane prattle was driving me insane. My advice, leave this one on the shelf."
1,Pretentious twaddle aka Hipster bible,"A real hipster bibleI was told well suggested to buy this book by a ex black metal guitarist turned pretentious foodie Via a liberal arts school. This book is a tedious mess .This was one of the worst books I have ever read I barely made it through before trading it in for credit at a used book store . The essay on David Lynch was rough I wonder if he has even seen a David Lynch film? Did he put it in there to seem smart? and why does name dropping make one seem hip anyway?I really agree with Bret easton Ellis , it seems makes people feel they are some kind of faux intellectual if you suggest it to people to read.My question is how did he write this book with his head up his rear end? Thats the real feat in this book!"
2,Just Okay,"David Foster Wallace's short essays can be amusing at times, but the descriptions can get tedious (see 500 footnotes for examples) and he rarely seems to connect with the people he's describing.I haven't read the DFW novels, but for hilarious and cringe-inducing non-fiction commentary, Sedaris is THE master, with Dave Eggers, Sloane Crossley and others far ahead of DFW.Sorry, I wanted to like the book more, especially with his untimely death."
3,Lots of weird stuff put together in one place,"Wallace is precocious--no doubt; his grammatical shenanigans shine in this work and inspired me to vow to risk more with my own writing from now on.He is also very, very funny when he trusts himself to get beyond junior high boy humor. I quickly tired of the ""ooooo let's snigger at the fat women"" snidery in his essay about the Illinois State Fair. (Please! It's tiresome when Letterman pulls out that old schtick, let alone some one with Wallace's obvious literary gifts.) Other than this, Wallace has a fine sense of the ridiculous as well as the salient: despite their supposed lightness, the state fair, cruise, and television essays have poignant observations about how we Americans consume entertainment."
4,some great essays from a brilliant mind,"There are 3 fantastic essays in here:""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again""""Getting Away from Being Pretty Much Away from It All""and the essay on Michael Joyce.Its extremely sad to see such a talented writer die young. This is a good book but not great only because there are a few doozies in here. Definitely, definitely read the three chapters above for a hilarious look at cruise lines, an anthropological study of ""white trash"" at the Illinois State Fair, and a behind the scenes look at tennis stars who never hit the spotlight. Dead on."
4,Wallace on a Cruise Ship?,"There are some great essays in the late(tragically) Prof. Wallace's book but the winner is the eponymous "" A Supposedly Fun Thing----"". OMG! He goes on a seven day luxury Caribbean Cruise--not his idea of course but an assignment from a magazine. I know I would rather die than go on a cruise but to be reminded in this hilarious essay just why that is the case was a delightful experience Do not miss it! The book, I mean, not the cruise---"
5,David and David,"Most people will be able to find a ""favorite"" essay among the wide variety of topics which DFW so ably analyzes in this book. I was intrigued by his account of visiting the movie set of David Lynch. This book was the first of Wallace's writing I ever read, and I can still remember the thrill of discovery that I felt. Some firsts always stay with you."
2,Doggedly trudged through the whole thing for a just reward,"This book was recommended by a highly regarded friend. Little did she know that I am truly an ignoramus and had in fact never even heard of Mr Wallace. I do have to say, as difficult as it was for me to read each painfully heavy page, I did come away with several observations: Tennis is way cool. David Lynch movies should at least be rented and watched. State Fairs, thank goodness, come around only once a year and last, but not least: I want very badly to go on a sea kayak tour of British Columbia with Mr. Wallace."
3,No wonder GenX claims him.,"Wallace, let us say, is jump-text personified,the perfect mouthpiece for a whole generationof graceless, immodest, hyper-ironic, and hyper-knowledgeable youth. In an age where readers really do want to see everything including the kitchen sink thrown into their books, where buyers care not so much about structure and coherence as they do about the amount of ""good stuff"" packedbetween covers--how much smarts they're getting for their Costco dollar--Wallace shines through brilliantly. I don't doubt the permanence of his reputation, either, as I believe we'll be seeing much more of the same from his surely imminent proteges."
4,freaking hysterical,"I got this book on a recommendation from a stranger who was reading the title essay while having a frothy brew down at the local watering hole. He was laughing so much I had to ask him what the hell he was reading. I got the book the next day and, well, you simply have to read the title essay. It's about his experiences on a carribean cruise ship- he goes into great detail about every aspect of ""cruise-life"", including (while going through one of his agrophobic moments) measuring the L x W of his cabin in Keds size 11 shoes. That cracked me up! He goes deeper too in this essay and the others (with a lot of unruly pontification) but I'll let you get the book and read it for yourself."
4,A great adventure!,"I started and failed to read this book several times beforefinishing it. Once I did, I was sorry I waited so long to dive intoit. While I was at first intimidated by the mathematical references, wordiness and abstract concepts of the first essay, once I got into it I enjoyed every word (or artifical word created by Wallace). I found the absurd references, made-up words, footnotes, and insightful descriptions of people's natures to be refreshing and thought-provoking. The last essay is particularly rich. I would definitely recommend this work to anyone wanting a bit of an intellectual stretch. Not that the concepts are difficult, just that the style takes a bit of getting used to. But it is definitely worth the effort!!!"
5,I Loved Every Word!,"I cannot think of enough good things to say about this collection on non-fiction by one of the greatest authors of all time. My favorites were the title essay, the discussion of the author's experience as a young tennis player, and his ""portait"" of David Lynch. This is a must-read for anyone who wants/likes to think!"
5,A Truly Great Book I'll Read Again And Again,"David Foster Wallace is perhaps the greatest living essayist. He's never just showing off, never just impressing the reader, even when he's showing off and thoroughly impressing. His prose rockets in every direction, changing angle and tone continously. And yet his essays are sharply focused and deeply engaged with their subject matter. Best of all, even though Wallace is forever exposing the ridiculous, his writing is warm, affectionate and modest. His pieces on taking a cruise (the title piece) and on attending the Illinois State Fair are as funny and carefully observed as anything in the english language."
4,Fast Read For Fast Times,"Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, and murder on Manhattan Island. It doesn't get any better than this. This mystery's main character, Ed Rogan, is The Man. Heavily into technology and sophisticated as all get out, Rogan is one cool cat who roughs up bad guys one after the other. Whenever it's his turn he just sucks it up and shakes it off. And he's smooth with the chicklettes.I like the way the author writes. He gives Rogan a lot of funny lines. This book is a well-written romp through the streets of Manhattan as Rogan tries to clear his name and catch the person who whacked his ex-wife."
3,Can't tell whether it's Stevie Ray or Eric,"People rave about both of these guys, and no doubt they are talented, but I think they're boring compared to Jimmy, Carlos and J. J."
1,Outdated Product,"The product arrived outdated by a month or so. Since it was salad dressing, we had to throw it out. Purchase price was refunded without any question."
4,Great early reader,"I'm a third-generation American, so I used this book to help my kids understand the immigration of their great-grandmother, especially relevant since we just spent Christmas with her. The time frame is earlier than Gramma's trip, but the desperation and the determination were right-on.I thought this book did a great job describing some scary things without totally freaking children out. And yet, my kids clearly understood how out-of-control the parents in this story felt all through their journey.The reading level is just right for this book -- excellent level 3 reader.ps -- it's so nice to read an early reader that isn't about Thomas the Train, Tinkerbell, or Star Wars!"
2,Not Impressed By New Release,"After listening to Tracys new album, I was no where near as impressed with this as I was with all of the other albums. Tracy has always been my favorite male country artist, but I feel this is a step down in quality from the other albums released over the years."
3,It's just regular.,"It ain't bad, but it ain't great.Just a regular album with better moments(LIFE DON'T HAVE TO BE THIS HARD,THAT WAS US),quite nice(IT'S GOT YOU ALL OVER)and songs written ""on the knee"". While listening, I had an impression that it's the same song playing all the time-it's because there is no HIT on the set(maybe except the first single LIFE ...). I wouldn't recommend it to a non-fan:even TL maniacs may be disappointed. Tracy!Concentrate on innovating your music not just copying your worst songs!"
2,Good vocals! No catchy lyrics,"The new Tracy cd is ok. I loved the first three cds of his career and don't get me wrong he is very talented, but he doesn't have the catchy lyrics he had when he started in his music career.His vocals are brilliant! But the songs are kinda dry. Maybe it's just my opinon I do wish him success with the new cd. But I have to be honest. Trace if you are reading this I still love you, but get some more catchy lyrics dude!And don't worry I will continue to support you and attend your concerts. Youre still my #1 fave male performer in Country Music."
2,unfortunately bad,"I was looking forward to an engaging critique of postmodernism. Aside from pointing out the most absurd examples of French Theory, this book does little else. Let me stress, I'm no fan of post structuralism, but the propagandistic quality of this work is too crude to convince anyone already sympathetic to French theory, and one is left wondering what Sokal's motives real are.Lastly, it might interest readers to know that two French brothers have recently (2001) pulled off a similar stunt, but this time the target seems to be theoretical physics. Not only have these brothers been able to publish several nonsense articles in scientific publications, they were also awarded a PHD! Poetic justice perhaps?"
1,fashionable scientific nonsense,"Neither Sokal nor those he criticizes are radical, and both of them are wrong at times, and right at other times. It is ridiculous to suggest that anything is more fashionable in the modern day than sporting the scientific attitude. This perhaps is the greatest danger of the day. Sokal could have chosen to talk about that, but there's not much fame in that. There is the other issue of uncertainty in science and many better lights of science than Sokal indeed have written about that. Perhaps Sokal's small-minded book serves the purpose of exposing obscure obscurantists but let us not kid ourselves into believing that he is defending rationality or some such construct."
1,polemically one sided approach to science.,"While I myself had not actually read the book, the problems I see with this work is tautologically apparent. PIAS works on an objective, logical truth that far exceeds mankinds framed reference of what can be epistemically available. Recent works have started to combine the gap between current science, and the emerging postmodernist methodologies to create a holistically balanced approach (I refer the reader to Sokal 1996). Our job as subjective viewers is to wait in the sidelines until the field codifies itself, but until then, reserve judgement."
1,what the postmodernism critics fail to see is that ...,"... in the end, my friend, postmodernism worships the god of the free market."
5,A Victory For Science and Reason,This was a desperately needed book. Science is easily abused; it can be used to justfiy utter non-sense and make exotic and irrational viewpoints appear to be supported by scientific achievement. Science has confered upon us a great confidence in the power of reason and it must not be used to make us loose that confindence that took us so long to achieve.Thomas Kuhn in the Light of Reason.
4,Excellent,"A brilliant and rather amusing book. It falls a little short in going down to the final consequences of the author's analysis, but it still is a book I would recommend anyone."
5,Better than I Expected,"This book was assigned as a summer project for my honors chemistry class, so I obviously had low expectations for it. I was pleasantly surprised. The book was actually quite enjoyable to read which, in turn, helped greatly in understanding periodicity. The title makes the book sound lame, but the author conveys a great and abstract knowledge of the periodic table through a metaphor - without making the reader feel like a small child. Albeit, I may be biased by my fondness for creative vocabulary which this book contains in abundance, so do not be surprised if it has you reaching for the dictionary a few times. All in all, this book is only among a few educational books I am not ashamed to recommend to people: I see that as a definition for success."
2,Still waiting for a good popular chemistry book,"I love chemistry, particularly the periodic table. However this book was a huge letdown. Whoever suggested it should have been written like a travel guide should be sacked. Instead of being an illuminating analogy it just obscured and annoyed. Phrases such as the 'shoreline of the noble gases was a lost world' just get in the way of very interesting science. Other reviewers have suggested it's a good children's book, but the science master series isn't designed as a childrens series. Others in the series (Diamond's and Margulis's come to mind) have been erudite, clear and interesting even if you have a good working knowledge of the subject. This isn't."
5,A Great Introduction,"As someone who teaches first year undergraduate students about periodic trends and attempts to give them an underlying cause that isn't physical chemistry heavy, this book has been an excellent source of discussion fodder for me. I enjoyed reading it the first time, though it didn't present anyting new. What it did do, for which I am very grateful, is present the material in a different, and visualizable way - a way that can be modified to the classroom.The metaphor gets a little heavy-handed towards the end, and at times I wished Atkins would lay off it a little, but this is likely due to my previous immersion in the material and not a problem with the book. Were it my first or second time through the material, or if I were a gen. chem. student struggling with the concept, I wouldn't feel so ""let's get on with it"" about it at all."
3,A condensed book containing the basics of the Periodic Table,"Before I embarked on The Periodic Kingdom, chemistry isn't my subject, but I am still familiar with it and have earned a top freshman student award in college. When I was reading the book, I can't help but feel it to be a review of what I have already known. That being written, the book is like a 146 page review of the basics of the periodic table including the elements. And how amazing is that? Not. Anyway, I can recommend the book to a neophyte before being interested in chemistry, and for anyone else, skip the book and find something else more hardcore."
2,A guide that helps to get lost!,"A very confusion guide though the ""period kingdom"". We easily get lost. The book could be improved if a card with a map of the ""period kingdom"" accompanied the little book."
1,Over-simplified and underinteresting,Who thought this book would be a good overview of chemistry. I doubt they're still in the business
5,"The Purpose of Computing Is Insight, Not Numbers","While there is very little text in the book, a single line in it can speak volumes when trying to understand the fundamental problem from a numerical analysis. Suppose you have been numerically studying data from an apparently chaotic process and a kind of structure presents itself in the form of a frequently found string of digits. The number itself provides little or no insight until compared to entries in the subject book. I have found hyperbolic and root functions that were not obvious, but were tremendously helpful in sorting out underlying dynamics and 'hidden' parameters. This book is not for everyone, but if you do numerical analysis, a single entry might save you weeks of work trying to find the functional pattern."
4,Multi-Cultural Music with Flair,"After going through the album the first time I found that ""Wooden Horse"" paints a picture in my mind of an old carrousel, I believe it's a metaphor for the cycles in life."
5,Great for thinning hair,FX Special Effects Root Lifter Volume Booster & Root Stimulating Serum - 6oz Great product for thinning hair just a little gives limp hair volume and texture. Can be used with other hair products also without any build up.
3,Good overview - lacks depth,This book can be good if you do not have graduate level education or some work experience. For someone just out of college wanting to start a business the book is a very helpful comprehensive guide. For someone who has an MBA or experience running a business the book can be a waste of time.
2,Not what they seemed,"I was disappointed in Amazon with this one. They are listed as being 12 inches tall, but that includes the packaging which doubles the size of the toy. They are really only about half of the listed dimensions, so not such a good deal."
3,Not at all like the picture,"Do not be an idiot like me, this does not have biometrics and looks nothing like the picture. Still it may be a decent Flash Drive."
5,It may not be the real thing ..... but it's damn good!,This mix make a sauce that tastes almost exactly like the true build from scratch sauce. The difference is that this one uses a single pan and takes about 5 minutes to make. I buy it on Amazon because my local market can't seem to get enough to keep on hand.
1,So bad we couldn't watch the whole movie,"We tried to watch ""Fire Down Below"" at a friend's house a few months ago; our friend is a real film buff, as am I, and my partner was looking forward to it too, given the great cast. Unfortunately, it stank to high heaven; the limbo-dance scene in the opening credits was the only thing worth watching. After that, it went downhill quickly, and after an hour of feeling embarrassed for actually watching it, we switched it off."
1,Bad experience,"Never received item and never received notice that item was not in stock. I had to finally inquire as to what happened, then got the run around with answers to what happened and my refund. Still don't think I ever received my money back. Very unhappy with treatment I the handling of the situation."
2,"5 stars for the original performances, 0 for the new production",Why is it that the quality is so bad that you get a headache after watching for just 5 minutes? They ought to have done far better justice to this invaluable material. Shame on these guys for lack of proper respect.
2,Horrible Footage,I purchased this DVD for my mom for Mother's Day and the black & white footage was so awful you couldn't even make out who the people were. Don't buy this peace of crap!
2,Soul collection,I had a problem seeing the artists on the dvd...because the lighting was too dark...just awful...very disappointed in the quality of this dvd
5,Just Fascinating,I recommend mostly for the music which is incredible and raw. It is like eating home cooking. But it is also fascinating to see the commercials and how over the 3 years this show was on production and commercialization developed. Plus the black & white TV format is compelling.
3,"delightful book on prejudice for children, if your family believes in God","As a whole, I would highly recommend this beautifully illustrated book on racism and prejudice. It is fun to read and an excellent way to address the topic with the youngest of children.The only thing that I think should be mentioned is it does (briefly) include religious context that might not be appropriate for all families when it concludes that it is god who was smart enough to make the zebras the way they are. While not promoting any specific god, this does make it inappropriate for a public school setting or for families of certain religious beliefs."
5,A MASTERPIECE,I love this book! I have not been able to put it down. This is a book that should be in every home. The creators of this magical book should be commended for giving us a precious gift that can support us in celebrating our differences.
4,Good Book!,"I work in a residential facility with different nationalities/ ethnicities of children. The issue raises quite often and this is a simple lesson that because people ""look"" different doesn't mean that we can't like one another and be friends. The end is a bit unrealistic that black and white come together to form one, but I truly believe that people can come together and form a cooperative, respectful union without becoming the same...differences are good and there doesn't have to be conformity."
4,And the Kenshin continues...,"This is not one of my favorite volumes, although I do like the episode about the faith healer, which has multiple layers to the story. I didn't care much for the story about the two manslayers, but the best episode on this tape in my opinion is the last one, where Kenshin and his friends go to the circus. Not only is if funny to see Kouru freaked about by the haunted houses, but we get to see (or more like hear) Kenshin do somthing that I don't think you'll hear him do anytime soon in the series; Sing ^_^"
2,BUYER BEWARE,contains the infamous sony-bmg rootkit spyware....buy at your on risk if you want to play on your PC. sony was sued and lost over putting this crap on their cd's. these were supposed to be pulled from retail sale as part of the settlement? (4 stars for the as usual excellent music by paradise lost)it may play in your pc but the rootkit IS installed like it or not. download the non-drm mp3 from amazon is your best bet
1,"Another victim of ""Metallica Syndrome""","How can I put this delicately? How about, ""This band is dead to me."" Paradise Lost is no longer metal. They used to be a unique goth-metal hybrid with visceral intensity and wailing guitars. Now the music is weak and droning. They are a hollow mockery of what they used to be. How anyone can call this album a ""return to form"" I will never know. What form? Fetal form? I've heard heavier music in a dental office.If you like intense music, check out their earlier albums from ""Gothic"" to ""Draconian Times"". They evolved nicely from album to album, hit their peak, and burned out. I guess their contract with Satan expired. Just like Metallica, they should have faked their deaths after Draconian Times and preserved a legacy of greatness. Like Jimi Hendrix did."
1,"Contains Palm Oil and and an ""amount"" of Trans fat","Smart Pop tastes good but it's not good for you. It contains palm oil which is one of the cheapest vegetable oils on the market. The World Health Organization states there is convincing evidence that palm oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. The fine print on the Smart Pop package says that the palm oil adds an amount of trans fat to each serving. They do not specify the actual amount other than to say that it's a ""trivial"" amount. No thanks!The FDA says ""Choose vegetable oils (except coconut and palm kernel oils) and soft margarines (liquid, tub, or spray) more often because the combined amount of saturated and trans fats is lower than the amount in solid shortenings, hard margarines, and animal fats, including butter."""
1,Contains Palm Oil - NOT Good,"The company wants you to think it's good for you. Since people have become aware of the dangers of trans fats and since companies must report trans fats on packaging, Orville Redenbacher / Con Agra Foods, uses palm oil instead. Palm oil is not only very bad for your health, please see some other devastating consequences of palm oil consumption, and then decide:Great info is provided by the Save the Orangutan Foundation which is a co.uk web address (and does not contain the word 'foundation' in the url / website). Just google it if necessary. The palm oil section is a MUST READ for anyone purchasing products such as this which contain palm oil.I have tried this and other of Con Agra's microwavable popcorn varieties, and they are so-so. But I refuse to purchase food items containing palm oil."
2,I guess u get what u pay 4,"dvd gets stuck alot and skips, I still watch it but its pretty agravating. wont order from them again! thanks"
5,Breath-Taking,"I have looked at this film as if it was my text book in school, over and over at least 7 times so far. Each time I pick up some amazing facts about Alleyne Wournos. This film has you caring for Lee and hating Lee, and caring for shelby and hating shelby all at the same time, whoa!!! Charlene Therone, is breath-taking in her role as ""Lee"" and my girl ""Wednesday"" from the Addams family, well she added the touches in supporting Charlene's roll. Kudos to you two ladies.!!!You know this movie makes you think how we as women are still not given respect to our bodies, even if we are prostituting,in the courtroom. Who would have believed her, if she reported the rape!!!Excellent work done by Patty Jenkins!!!"
4,Where are the special features??!,"I agree - Charlize Theron acted her ""African-American"" hind-parts off! I will buy the DVD as soon as they release one with some decent special features. It's not good enough to put a movie out anymore. Consumers expect some background information, etc. And it only serves to frustrate me when I buy the first release of a DVD only to have them release the collector's edition a few months later. So I am choosing to wait until the full fledged collectors edition of Monster is relased. And it better be jam packed with special features!"
2,Sexual Violence,This movie was very violent and depressing. Charlize Theron did a very good job. You could hardly tell that it was her in the role that she was playing because she looked so plain and the part was unlike anything I have ever seen her play; but the movie had a lot of violent sexual content and was sometimes hard to watch. If you have a problem with homophobia you definiteley do not want to watch this movie.
1,Absolutely Dreadful,I like movies in which you take something away from it. I am SO very glad that I decided to rent this schlock! STAY AWAY FROM IT!
1,a trashy movie for drunks,why watch this movie when you can see donna in indiana shes the closest to ailen warnos ive seen
3,Not exactly what I thought it would be......,"Let me start out by stating that Theron's performance is outstanding. The movie itself was good but not as great as I believed it to be from the reviews. Maybe it was because I thought it would be more along the lines of a ""Biography"" or ""American Justice"" type of film when in reality, it was closer to a romance. This film paid a lot of attention and detail to the relationship between Lee (Charlize Theron) and Shelby (Christina Ricci) and despite great acting, I found their story dragging in spots. I enjoyed watching this film's perspective on Eileen Wormus and would recommend it on Charlize Theron's performance alone (she blew everyone else away in this film) but I would not recommend repeated viewings."
4,Good just not great,"Theron's acting is better than the movie itself. The movie is slow at some points, but have some excellent moments. I would've like to see more of the trial, and less of the emotion."
3,Sad story Great acting,"The story of this woman and her life are incredibly sad. The movie did not explain enough about her childhood and past for me, but I love Charlize and Christina and would pay just to see them act in anything."
2,Monster,I was disappointed in the movie. It was not up to my expectations. This had nothing to do with your service.
4,One Real Life Monster.....,"Who would have guessed pretty woman, Charlize Theron, could have been transformed to look almost exactly like female serial killer Aileen Wuornos? Let alone give an acting performance not to be missed!!Great screenplay/movie on how Aileen Wuornos became the female serial killer she was and of the crimes she committed! Great acting performances by both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci."
1,Naomi Watts was robbed,"oh man, the pretty lady went from pretty to butt ugly and she swears a lot. let's give HER the oscar and completely ignore GOOD actresses like naomi watts and jennifer connely(sp?). this is one of THE most boring movies i've ever seen. and i'm not offended by the fact that she was a serial killer, i love serial killers, but this was just feminazi horsepiss. oh boo hoo, she was raped as a girl, any idea how many young girls are raped and DON'T turn into murderers? a lot. don't waste your time, flat movie for a boring actress. see 21 grams or the house of sand and fog instead."
1,Horrible Movie,"I absolutely hate this movie. The way the character of of Aileen Wuornos was portrayed was too sympathetic and gentle, other then her crimes. I also thought all the lies about the guys trying to abuse her were ludicurous. Poor movie. Stupid!"
1,Sick Film,"This is a true story based on the serial killings of Aileen Wournos, a prostitute. I can't add to the reviews here...they've pretty much covered everything about the movie.THe only thing I will add is that in my estimation, this is the kind of film that gives Hollywood a bad name and promotes unhealthy morals and values. A film where every other word is the ""F"" word or ""G...D...""....and there is explicit homosexual sex..(graphic hetero sex is bad enough)and...look, I'm gay myself, but I don't like to have it crammed down my throat.It is a disturbing film....NOT FOR CHILDREN>>>OR ADOLESCENTS.....the acting by Theron is good...she does scare the fire out of you with her performance but the profanity was unnecessary. I find it hard to sympathize with Christina Ricci's character...she's too whiny and childish. Please avoid this film at all costs."
5,Charlize Theron = AMAZING,"If there is no other reason you want to see this film, see it just for Charlize Theron's performance. This role couldn't have been easy to play but she was unforgettable as Aileen Wuornos. I liked her work before this movie, but now I am truly a fan."
1,Horrible Blu-Ray.... Terrific Film,Charlize Theron gives a stunning performance and the film itself is terrific. The Blu-Ray however is terrible!!! Voices do not synch with the actors. Incredibly noticeable and distracting. i immediately returned the bluray and went back to the original dvd.
5,"Disturbing, but superb acting","Charlize Theron really gets inside the mind and physical personna of the serial killer here. The makeup job is phenomenal, and she gained 30 pounds for the role. Christina Ricci, too, is fantastic as the dim-witted girlfriend. This movie perfectly captures the sleazy Florida underside where Aileen Wuornos operated. That doesn't make this movie easy to watch. It's not. It's a deeply disturbing film that is more art than entertainment."
3,don't expect a documentary,"Loosely based on a true story we see the crimes unfold through the eyes of the murderer. Always seeing herself as a victim rather than a cold blooded killer, the movie lends some support for that notion. We are to believe she is nauseous at the thought of casual sex yet does not hesitate to fire fatal shots. She is even depicted as having mercy on one potential victim who was a virgin. The acting is excellent. However, the scenery, costumes and music are mediocre. The film offers no comic relief. To its credit, the movie does not glamorize crime, but starkly portrays the bleak existence of those on the run. The title MONSTER is provocative. She did not torment her victims or even scare them. Male serial killers have done far worse, yet we judge females by a double standard. The sad part is it appears she killed merely to have money to support her addictions to tobacco and alcohol."
4,Impressive,"Gritty drama and true story about the story of Aileen Wuornos. I was completely impressed by the incredible acting and story telling. How they made the lovely Charlize Theron look so unbecoming is remarkable and she completely nailed the part of Aileen. Ricci was just as good an actress and deserved some recognition.There was nothing fancy or beautified about this movie at all. It was edgy, a bit raw and very straight forward. All the more convincing and a highly recommended watch. No sympathizing here with Aileen, just the straight story telling of her life and her tragic end."
3,If You Must,"For starters, Charlize Theron gives a landmark performance as serial-killer Aileen Wuornos as the Oscar and other testimonials will attest to. Her performance is not all make-up, prosthetics and weight gain. Theron gets inside the skin of this used and abused and ultimately evil individual. Christina Ricci matches her as her naive lover and unwitting accomplice. Also, any film that features Bruce Dern, albeit in a smallish role, is aces in my book. As tawdry as the tale here is, it is not done in an exploitative manner. That said, this is not the type of film I care to re-visit very often. It's a compelling yet not very pleasurable experience. If you have to see one serial killer movie, then this is probably the one to see."
3,monster blu ray!!!,well the movie is so great and obviously well cast.but in the blu rays deffence this really's not hi quality.its just a dvd and nothing else.i dont know why they keep making blu rays that are not hi def..
4,great acting,"Riverting acting so good the film reverbereated in my thoughts the next dayt is that well acted.Its about what happens when poor folk slip through the cracks in social services and there for the grace of God go I- the spiralling down of negative forces attract more negativeinfluences.Just moving and no hammed-up acting.More info than we need?And then the unsettling fact that soceity has its taboos for a reason because nibbling at them can be an unraveller like staring at children's genitals on the beach or one only curious hit on an opiate. Or even in Monster the young teen who trades a little sex to buy a few treats to cheer up a dreary day in a dreary life make this an unnerving film even if ""Go ask Alice"" is its counter-poise."
4,The Disappearance of Charlize Theron,"MONSTER would still be a good movie without Charlize Theron...but after watching it a couple of times, it is fascinating to watch Ms. Theron literally disappear into this serial killer.For a woman who is used to walking red carpets and gracing magazine covers, she really becomes an ugly, badly-damaged woman hooking along lonely highways. There isn't a false note in any single frame of this movie. She deserved the Academy Award, that's for sure.From what I've seen in the documentaries about Aileen Wornos, this film humanizes her more, shifts a little away from her mental illness, and makes Christina Ricci's character more attractive, although it keeps her betrayal of Aileen at the end.This is a sad, frightening story about women on the outside and the lengths they'll go to find love and acceptance in a dark and horrible world. Even cold-blooded murder."
3,"Theron's performance noteworthy, all else unremarkable.","Theron's performance merited the Oscar she received. By looking at Theron you couldn't imagine she could grunge up and portray a white trash, uneducated, disturbed so well.The rest of the performances weren't substantial and the plot itself is what you would expect."
1,WARNING This film should have been rated at least NC -17,"I saw this movie in the movie theater and felt assaulted. The language was vulgar and unending in its relentless onslaught. The rape scene was very intense. Charlize Theron's character is naked tied up across the front seat of a car while her attacker pours alcohol over what appears to be burns while she screams and then he gets a metal pipe to rape her with from behind. Not to mention the lesbian sex scenes. When I saw Matrix I wondered why the film got an R rating? What? you get an R for the 1 billionth slow-motion karate chop? I do not consider myself a prude. I watch my share of porn, and usually ""enjoy"" an occasional intense dramatic movie. This movie was too much for me. If you are a person with abuse issues or if you have teenagers, this is NOT the movie for you. Having said all that Charlize Theron did give the performance of a lifetime."
3,Depressing ...,"Excellent performances from both female leads, but be prepared for one of the most depressing films of 2003.Theron portrays a prostitute serial killer, but as we learn, she became this way because she was nearly killed herself by a client. It became a habit for her, and obviously she enjoyed killing people. Ricci portrays her lover, but I felt her character became annoying as the film went on. I'll always think of Ricci in the Addams Family.The transformation of Theron from Hollywood bombshell to downright ugly is incredible. Amazing what make-up can do to people these days.An interesting film, but is far from being the masterpiece it has been hailed as."
1,YUCCA DEW,"yes, I know, Im such a whiz with wirds, arent I. Well, despite my lack of literary talent when it somes to writing reviews, THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL! It had sooo much potential and could have been sooo good, but it fell so short that youd need a ladder to climb up to the status of errible. I think that I was expecting something akin to Executioners Song and what I got was something akin to a DVD coma.The one star that I gave was for that Charlize persons performance, which despite the boring ,slow ,awful, horrible, terrible, dull, flat ,missed opportunity of a movie,she did a great job.and her make up job was fabulous.so thats my $.02"
5,Performance of a Lifetime,"I saw ""Monster"" a few nights ago, and still find myself thinking about Charlize Theron and the performance she gave. This is surely the performance of a lifetime...for her, and possibly for anyone who sees this film. Acting truly gets no better than this....period, end of story. Forget about the make-up, which is incredible...forget about the weight gain, which totally camoflages Theron's stunning beauty...they're secondary to an acting job that is an incredible work of art. There is no other choice for this year's Oscar for Best Actress...there shouldn't even be a contest. No one else deserves this honor.Christina Ricci should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress...she was robbed, as was the film, which undoubtedly belongs in the race for Best Picture, not to mention Patty Jenkins who should have recieved a nod for Best Director.In every sense of the word, ""Monster"" is a shattering, American tragedy."
2,What a HORRIBLE script this is...,"Well, again after all the hype over this, I pre-ordered it, and watched it last night. What a disappointment! The acting was, as everyone's saying, ""top notch"", but when it comes to the script - wtf? The movie's boring, not to mention the fact that I personally had a hard time feeling much of anything for either of the main characters. If I want to watch white trash, I'll watch Gummo. If I want rape, I'll watch Irreversible. This merely dabbled in both. Again, this is an art film for non film appreciating AmeriKa... Pretty sad. Good rental for your beer drinking friends, but anyone who appreciates fine cinema will just be let down in the end."
2,going down the hill,"Ok so the main character did pick up a couple of awards but.... it was just an ok movie. It's not a complete waste of your money, although I would buy it, I would just pay my little five dollars to rent it because to be honest it's not worth more than that. In the beginning it's interesting, but then after each minute passes your like, is this the same movie that I rented thirty minutes ago?But you got hand it to them with the make up because they both just look like...well...bums! If that was the look they were trying to go for then well done!"
2,Monsters,"I found it a ok film, but got bored with it and did the fast forward thing. it has some good tender moments, not my kind of movie I guess"
2,Only good thing is the acting,"The only good thing about the film is the amazing quality of acting done by Ms. Theron. She quite deservedly won an Oscar for her role.However, the rest of the film stinks. This is a sympathetic portrait of a merciless serial killer. We are made to feel sorry for a woman who, in cold blood, murdered several men."
3,Charlize Theron is Very Good - The Movie is Average,"Monster is the true story of convicted female mass murderer Aileen Wuornos. Monster is a decent movie, but due to a rather thin story line and intermittent empty dialogue, it falls short of better true crime dramas such as The Executioner's Song. In fact, without Charlize Theron, Monster would be a B movie at best. But even as good as Theron is, there are moments where her mannerisms and characterizations remind me of Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice character. Charlize Theron is very good, but Monster still lacks the suspense, chill, and terror factor of better true crime movies such as the 1967 B&W version of In Cold Blood."
1,Blu-ray Version Don't Buy This!,"I like this film, but the Blu-ray disc is so substandard that it is hard to organize all the negative thoughts I have about it. The general video quality is virtually the same as the standard def version...non of the qualities you associate with HD show up on this disc. The dark scenes are just horrid. The audio is poor and severely out of sync with the picture...in some cases about one second off. If you own the standard def version, do not think the Blu-ray is an upgrade, it is not. Having tried to watch this (and being irritated by it) I would not bother to rent it. I own over 300 Blu-ray discs and this is absolutely the worst. I'm sending it back to Amazon for a refund"
5,Don't miss the point.,"Several reviewers have said that they expected the film to be about a serial killer who happens to be a lesbian, not vice versa. Let's keep in mind that Wuornos was not a lesbian at the beginning. She became infatuated with a woman because this was the only human being that was interested in even talking to her. Wuornos was so intensely desperate for meaningful human contact that she would have done anything to prolong the romance with Selby Wall, including murder.This film has boiled down the most distressing human experiences: homelessness, failure, shame, regret, isolation, substance abuse, etc. Its depiction of this is so real that you will truly feel something. And that is what watching a movie is supposed to be about."
5,"So, so sad","Makes you wonder why people are allowed to have children, and how many thousands of would be Aileen's that are becoming teenagers. When the young Aileen told her father she was being molested by one of his jerk-off friends and dear old dad didn't believe her and the guy kept on molesting her. That was were she got her low self esteem and thoughts of being worthless. I guess if we lived in a world where people were driven by logic and reason instead of power and greed couples would be tested to see if they could physically and mentally cope with the unrelenting stress of parenthood. But, that would be too easy."
2,Powerful Acting for a Fictional Retelling of a Story,"This movie was hard to watch after doing so much research into the life of Aileen Wuornos for school. While she had a horrible childhood and mental illnesses ran in her family, she was not the emotional wreck portrayed by Charlize Theron in the movie. Wuornos never showed remorse for any of her killings, more than one of the victims was not a ""john"" looking for a prostitute. The actual person, Tyria, that the character Selby is very loosely modeled after is also vastly different. The movie is good in its own right, but I wish they gave more accurate information at the end."
3,I was a little dissapointed,"I watched the documentary that this movie is based on, and I highly recommend researching that first. I think the actors did a mostly good job. But I felt it wasn't close enough to what really happened."
4,DVD,Chilling movie a true story!! Ms. THeron does an amazing acting job. Again it arrived early!!! !!!! !!! !! !!
4,Not Bad,"Great insight to a true story but not my taste in genre with homosexuality, in regards to women, however, very insightful and thought provoking of the real story behind these five murder committed by Charlize Theoron's character. Christina Ricci's character, crazy but not very good acting."
5,Great quality,"I had to watch this movie for a class about Women in Corrections...Went to find this on Netflix and Hulu but neither had it available. I really did not want to rent the movie from a store so I checked Amazon and to my surprise, they had it available to rent! Thanks Amazon for saving my grade!!"
2,Kit includes ONLY the filter,"Despite the name of this product including the word ""kit"", note that it has ONLY the filter and no pan gasket."
3,Interesting . . . but not exceptional,"Interesting collaboration, but nothing mind-bending here. Yo-Yo Ma has the ability to work well with anyone, but his best work is usually his straight classical stuff. Some good moments, but for something more experimental, you'd be better off with something from Steve Tibbetts or Steven Roach."
2,bombastic,"This is interesting music I GUESS, but any of Philip Glass's art feels so insecure to me, like he's so unsure of himself that he has to go out of his way to prove himself...This cd is pretty meaningless to me, though I know he & other people really worked on it with their lives. I suggest reading other reviews in addition to mine."
5,Grand Opera for the New Age,"Although I am a classical opera fan, this rates right up there with the best. Glass's works are always beyond the usual romances and petty bickering sung to music. Call this opera for the New Age or minimalist or what you will, but this particular one is a must-have for those who enjoy his music."
4,"Good, but not quite like Koyaanisqatsi","This is a good album, but my favorite of the trilogy is Koyaanisqatsi. This movie was really beautiful and this score was an integral part of making it work. If you enjoy Philip Glass, you'll like this one."
3,almost decent slasher ruined by a rushed and stupid ending..,"lame acting, laughable deaths, and only mild suspense, but still a fun movie...i found myself enjoying this a great deal...then just as things were getting good..it was over, in one second, it ended,bam, the killer was revealed and a close-up or his/her face was given and it was over...if some thought and time were spent on the ending this would have been a great flick...but it was just too stupid for words...it was clever and shocking yes, but too rushed...the movie itself was good up to the final 2 minutes...overall a 2.5..."
1,One of the good slasher movies from the 80's,"Sleepaway Camp is one of those unforgetable horror movies (slasher type) that you see and want to remember and tell your friends the scenes of deaths and dialogues, because it's all so well done and cool that you enjoy the feature. An unforgetable end that is rated as the most shocking climax in cinematic history. Recommended. Number 2 is also very cool and has one or two scenes that you will also remember for years. Good work of Pamela Springsten in numbers 2 and 3."
2,This Has to Be Seen to be Believed,"I give this a 3 out of 10, and 2 of the 3 points are for an incredible special effect involving an arrow through a guy's neck. I watched that in slo-mo 10 times and can't figure out how they did it, and it's especially amazing because it's about the only special effect in the entire movie! The other point I give because of the jaw-dropping ending others have mentioned. I won't call it disturbing or eerie because it's so amateurishly filmed, but it still needs to be seen to be believed. It's not a so-bad it's good movie, more of a ""I can't believe someone out there made this and actually released it and people 17 years later are still watching it"" movie. As for the DVD, it's got a surprisingly good picture for a low budget movie nearly two decades old. The commentary by the director and the lead actress is fairly entertaining."
3,Just a little more than another '80s slasher flick,"When I picked up this movie and viewed it for the first time, I misjudged it by thinking it was just another Friday the 13th rip-off. Everything seemed to prove that: two kids going to another Camp for the summer, the typical characters of jocks and half-naked girls. The two kids both get in the camp, the boy gets accepted immediately but his sister starts having a hard time. Suddenly mysterious, quite brutal murders start to occur - taking down youngsters one-by-one...The ending is however not your ""reveal-the-identity"" scene like for instance Halloween or Friday the 13th... I must admit it had me freaked for a while. Rent it to find that one out - this is without doubt NOT just another '80s slasher movie."
3,Classic 80's Horror,This movie is a classic 80's horror movie where you know what's going to happen before it does. I recommend this movie to all horror movie fans because it is a classic. Just enough blood and a psychotic killer.
3,About average for the genre but with a great (killer) endin,"This 80's slasher movie is about as good as many others, except for the ending. I real shocker."
3,Trashy seedy lil shop of horrors...WITH A KILLER TWIST,"This isn't high art, but for what it is - a trashy, shoe-string, seedy shoestring horror flick from the early 80s - SLEEPAWAY CAMP is at the very least compulsively watchable. While basically gore-free (like HALLOWEEN), and with a campers-in-peril setting that recalls countless other shockers (FRIDAY THE 13TH, et al.), this nasty little shop of horrors does have quite creative death sequences bordering on the hysterical...and one of the most shocking, perverted ""gotcha"" endings in horror history - the final ""shocking"" reveal is guaranteed to make you spill your popcorn. A fun late-night rental."
1,Banned in some countries,"This movie is banned in some countries, but not because it is explicit or nasty. It is banned because the government of these countries wants to save its citizens from watching a very poor horror film. It just doesn't cut it. If you want bad acting, bad sets, bad special effects and ages between things happening, then watch SLEEPAWAY CAMP. This is in my top 5 of the worst horror films of all time. People here will rave about the shock ending. They obviously haven't seen decent films like ""Crying Game"". I wondered why I had never heard of this movie because I thought I knew alot of about the genre. So you can imagine how I felt when I finally got to see it the other day. It is that bad! Avoid at all costs."
1,A Very Stupid pointless movie,"This was the second worst movie i have ever seen so being the second worst i had to give it one star and not 0. I did like one kill that was very corny and had really fake blood, and how unoriginal it was. And the ""Really Great and shocking ending"" was horrible and it is not like the cliffhanger endings that everyone dreads no no no, it's much worse! The acting wasn't horrible but it was bad. The plot could have done well, or not, we already have enough 'Jason' type movies. Again don't waste anytime with it, sadly i did. For the number one worst movie search for 'SICK'."
1,rip off of friday the 13th,this was just onother rip off of halloween and friday the 13th which are two great films(halloween is better). This film is verry cheap and there are like 12 year olds and 13 year olds ussally they hire 20 year olds to play teens that are 17 or 18 but this film accutally has kids in it. it is a verry weird with a verry wierd feeling movie and done verry messy. the killers identity was so obvious and the story behind it was confuusing watch friday the 13th or even better watch halloween.
5,Best Movie of All Time,"Bad acting + Thick New Yawk accents + cheap sets + silly dialogue + the most shocking surprise ending since The Sixth Sense = one of the most hilariously entertaining movies of all time. Thank you so much Anchor Bay for rereleasing this movie...I hadn't seen it in years. OK on to the movie. Sleepaway Camp starts out with a father taking his two young children out boating one sunny afternoon. Suddenly another boat hits the family killing the father and one of the children. Years later, we see it is Angela who survived the accident and is now living with her aunt(who seems like she's on some drugs) and her foul mouthed, charming cousin Ricky. Ricky and Angela head off to summer camp, where a campers start getting murdered. Is the killer Ricky? Angela? Their friend Paul? or that B$tc! Judy?Sleepaway Camp shouldn't be taken seriously, and is one of my favorite movies of all time."
4,Sleepaway Camp- A Gold Mine of '80's Cinema!!!,"Sleepaway Camp is a film like no other, except for maybe all ten Friday the 13th films, and any other slasher flick ever made, but don't let that discourage you. Sleepaway Camp is one of the best works of horror cinema I have ever viewed. Whilst the gore is not so intricate that it will make Grandma Rose vomit in her lap, it gets the job done. The screenplay is absolutely hilarious, in which every boy at camp is looking to get some play, and every girl at camp... is looking to get some play. For those of you who might watch part of it and said, ""This is horrid. I'm turning this piece of [junk] off and chucking it into the sea,"" you haven't watched it long enough. This film may seem monotonous and overplayed at times, but hang in there. If you watch it until the end, I guarantee you won't regret it. This film is wonderful. I give Sleepaway Camp all the praise I possibly can."
4,"A Good Horror Movie, Worth Watching","I grew-up watching 80's horror movies and , granted, Sleepaway Camp isn't the finest ""slasher-movie"" ever made, it is not as bad as some of the Friday the 13th sequels.What many reviewers fail to mention in their review of this movie is its ability to seemlessly switch from humorous, light moments to scary, horrific ones. Many horor movies have a hard time maintaining the two tones and instead rely on gross-out, overally sexual, or plain ""stupid"" humor to give their movie an element of lightness. This made Sleepaway Camp's death scenes more surprising and unexpected at times.Sleepaway Camp may not be popular like Friday or Nightmare, but it is in there league as far as storyline goes. Although it isn't a flawless movie, Sleepaway Camp does a great job of presenting a storyline that keeps the audience intereasted. I've watched plently of ""horror movies"" in the past that required a walkout due to bad dialogue or a totally lame plot; this wasn't one of them."
2,2/5 RATING=WORST CAMP MOVIE AROUND,"This has been called a Friday The 13th [imitation] by many for apparent reasons,it takes place at camp and the movie has a similar outcome. With that aside Sleepaway Camp still is pretty decent to watch,it uses some interesting twists and has nostagic feeling to it. Also the [end of life] scenes are far-fetched(flesh-eating bees)but clever at the same time. Many people talk about the ending,I thought it was ok but had similarities to Pyscho and Friday The 13th. It was unpredictable though...,plus with to many ... undertones ..."
1,This Movie is Garbage,"This movie was totally stupid and random. One scene a guy falls out of his canoe while being an idiot in the middle of the night. And it just so happens that the killer is underwater waiting for him. Its so stupid, I would definitely not rent this movie if I knew how rotten it was. I prefer the Evil Dead series or Robot Ninja (a disgusting gore fest)."
1,what a waste of a dvd and of time,this movie has a widescreen transfer and looks great it's to bad they wasted all this effort on one of the worst and sickest slasher movies of the 80's. the cast is full of over aged actors playing teens and the final 10 mins. are the sickest and most distasteful endings i have ever seen this is one film that should never have been given the green light. spend your money on anything else. the fact that 2 more were made says a lot about what some people think a horror or slasher movie should be. the worst not a good scene in the whole movie.if i could give this no stars i would. i bought this one not knowing what it was and slod it as quick as i could.
3,I'm concerned about the curling iron.,"This is B-movie material, but that's not bad in this case. Remember, it was the 80s. There's got to be a guilty pleasure in the library. Why not Sleepaway Camp? The story unfolds as you would probably expect. Plenty of horror flicks bounce out of summer camps. But I don't think anyone could predict the ending. Somebody certainly has some issues! I think I made the same face as the two camp counselors (you'll know what I'm talking about if you watch the movie) when the ending shot me in the face like a cannon. Believe it or not, this semi-predictable horror film definitely has a surprise in store."
2,Some originality lifts generic slasher film,"Eight years after a summer camp boating accident leaves a man dead, two of his kin - smartmouthed Ricky (Jonathan Tierston) and his introverted cousin Angela (Felissa Rose) return to Camp Arawak. The other campers (who have the worst attitudes since ""The Bad News Bears"") start to give Angela a hard time and Ricky swears vengeance. Soon after, the kids, the director, and the pedophile cook fall victim to a young killer. Despite the tepid story, slasher fans should be pleased by the grisly deaths and surprise ending. Film has cult following, although I'm not as sold on this movie as they are. Included is the theatrical trailer, and commentary with director Robert Hiltzik, star Felissa Rose, and Sleepaway Camp buff Jeff Hayes."
4,A Cheesy Horror Classic,"I didn't expect anything great when I bought this movie. I expected a run of the mill slasher movie. Boy, was I in for a shock! If there's one thing this movie's NOT, it's run of the mill. It's quite possibly the quirkiest horror film I have ever seen. The characters are delightfully strange and the plot is quite unique, despite the generic setting of the film. But what really makes this film worth it is the ending... the BEST ENDING in horror history, no doubt about it. Highly recommended!"
5,hilarious,"this is a great movie. not really scary, but it's actually very, very good. all horror fans should watch this. it's about these kids who go to camp, they're getting killed...who did it? im not gonna reveal anything, BUT SEE THE ENDING!! IT'S THE BEST ENDING OF A MOVIE EVER.....EVEN IF YOU HATE HORROR MOVIES...SEE THE ENDING, YOU'LL BE SOOO HAPPY YOU DID! So enjoy...."
4,Typical 80's Horror Movie,"I love horror movies. I saw this movie, and it wasn't disappointing, but I could tell they were trying to get the same audience as ""Friday the 13th"". It was very strange, and I was in shock at the end(you'll know what I mean when you watch it). I think that if your a horror movie buff like myself, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is definetly worth watching. Expect the same thing as from the other 80's horror movies. Not so good acting, but satisfyingly scary."
4,True Classic...,"First Of, The Last Time That I Seen This Movie Was When I Was Younger, But I Have Been Hunting For It For Maybe The Last Few Months. This Movie Leaves An Everlasting Impression On You. Plot and Story Line Are Good and Original. Definetely Something To Add To Your Collection of Movies!"
4,"Very Shocking, Not so scary, Confusing, Good though","I saw the movie knowing that Angela was a boy so it was to surprising, but they way it was pulled off really freaked me out. I thought the flashbacks were good, but I didn't understand some of them. Why was the little boy pointing at Angela. I didn't understand that. And what was the point of killing the father(or uncle) in the begining. Were the wo young kids Angela and Ricky. All in all it was pulled off okay with a great ending, yet a little confusing."
2,What the h*** is wrong with this movie?,"I am a total fan of horror movies, I have probably seen a million. This is without a doubt one of the worst pieces of s**t that I have ever had the disfortune to see. I ask not only what is wrong with this movie, what is wrong with all the people that gave it good reviews? I was creeped out, not because it was scary, because it was weird and nonsensical. The only parts that geniunely scared me was any scene containing that creepy-a** mother."
1,Corny Corny Corny,"I had heard of Sleepaway Camp many moons ago, but hadn't seen it until I bought this movie in the $5.99 section at Best Buy, and boy am I glad I didn't spend too much money on it. This movie is just plain cheesy, boring, and not scary at all. Okay, I've got to admit, the film kept me wondering what was going to happen and who the killer was, but the ending to this movie was one of the hokiest I have ever seen. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the film yet, but oh brother was the ending stupid. That ending was not worth the 90 minute wait, especially since the first 90 minutes weren't very interesting. It's pretty typical ""b"" movie acting and sound/picture quality, without the frightening effect of some other ""b"" slasher flicks. The death scenese are completely telegraphed and don't make you jump at all. I guess if you like truly corny horror movies, then this one might be up your alley, otherwise stay away!"
1,never received,I love this movie as a child me and my big sister would watch it all the time so when i found it on amazon I was glad even arranged a movie night for my friends and family to watch it but to my surprise I never received it Pissed off customer I will think twice bout buying something from this seller anger customer
4,Yummy!,"I'll save you all the pain of reading the novels for reviews you see down below:This movie is great, an 80's must-see and must-have essential in your horror collection. The twist ending had never been seen before back then and it hasn't been duplicated since! Yeah, I know it's the blah-blah-blah-teens-at-summer-camp-stalked-by-a-maniac cliche, but how many horror films touch the homosexual nerve and show 2 guys in bed for god's sake??? Genius! Genius! GENIUS! RENT THIS, BUY THIS, whatever you do, go out and ENJOY this one!"
2,Could've Been Better,"I read one review and have to say I agreed completely. This movie had a chance to be a huge horror success. It has all the characteristics of the genre except one, it really wasn't scary. The killings were not the type you talk about with your friends. They could've been more gorey a la Friday the 13th as it takes place in the same time frame.The movie itself, However is tolerable in that the story is interesting enough to get you to THE ENDING!! You may have seen some weird endings before but nothing can prepare you for this. As everyone else has said I'm not giving it away. If I could give 2 1/2 stars I would. If they would've expanded the killing scenes and spilled some more blood I would've rated it a 4."
3,Full version of the film!,This is the fully uncut version of the film! The Anchor Bay dvd has a few slight cuts to some of the death scenes. The picture and sound on this version are that of an old vhs but still watchable. If you have the box set get this one too just so you can see what has been cut from the Anchor Bay version. You cant beat a dvd for $5!
4,good if you like cheesy 80s horror movies,"I have to admit i am a huge 80s horror movie buff this was a good film if that is what you are into i really liked this movie along with the sequals,its basicly about a crazy women who raised a boy as a little girl his whole life, and when he-she goes to sleepaway camp people start to die in diffrent ways i especially loved the end of this movie i would say if you love 80s horror dont miss this on"
3,ONE REALLY SCARY SCENE MAKES THIS MOVIE MEMORABLE,This movie isn't any better than most of the other 80s slasher movies (many of which I love) but there is a single scene in this thing that is SURE to scare the living hell out of anyone who views it for the first time! It's strange that this scene contrasts so sharply with all that happened before it. It's almost as if it was suddenly directed by a different person! It's this scene in particular that made a name for this movie. Worth seeing if you haven't already!
3,Another 80's Classic!!!,"This was a pretty good slasher! I loved all the gore and death scenes! Felissa Rose did an awesome job and was extremely sexy as Angela! At camp, a lot of people pick on Angela because she never really talks, except to her cousin, Ricky and her new boyfriend Paul. If anyone taunts or makes fun of Angela, they usually end up dead. If you love horror, twists, and sexy transsexuals, you'll love SLEEPAWAY CAMP!!!"
2,A flop.,"This is Bush's worst album without a doubt.It has its moments, but overall it just sounds way to sqeaky clean and polished.Best moments are ""Inflatable"" AND ""Out of This World"", the rest is just throw away material and really is'nt very interesting.For the real BUSH check out the raw and less focussed sound of ""Razorblade Suitcase"" or the alternative sound of ""The Science of Things."""
4,"Hey, this is pretty good!","I recently re-listened to all my Bush CDs, and I was surprised to discover that Golden State was my second favorite, after 1994's outstanding Sixteen Stone of course. Although Razorblade Suitcase and Science of Things include some of my favorite Bush songs, their good-songs-to-crap-songs ratio is a little too high. On the other hand, I like almost every song on Golden State, except for the vapid single ""The People that We Love"" and the absolutely annoying ""My Engine is with You"". Unfortunately for Golden State, these two songs keep it from getting a five-star rating, which is reserved for those albums, like Sixteen Stone, that have no faults."
4,one step back,"This album is not at all as good as Bush's previous material, The Science of Things. I'm not saying it's bad, because it's still really good music, but it's a step back for the british band.Only a few songs really stand out on this CD, unlike on the last album, on which almost all songs were brilliant. Warm Machine, Chemicals Between Us, Letting The Cables Sleep... really awesome songs. On this one, the outstanding tracks are definetely SPEED KILLS - the first single, INFLATABLE - a great ballad that i totally love, but still far from THE Bush ballad, Letting the cables sleep, and MY ENGINE IS WITH YOU, a great, furious, fast-paced song, probably the best of the whole album.Still, Gavin sings great, just like on every other album, the songs are well written and it's a pleasant listen... you won't regret spending your money on it. But if you wanna buy only ONE Bush album, get The Science of Things."
2,Not impressive,"Although there has been hype for Golden State, there's little that's very great about it. It's not as bad as some of the fourth-generation grunge and so-called punk that's been overplayed, but it still has no edge Bush once had. Filled in the album, the Bush-we-all-knew tunes, and there are only three okay tracks. There's the strong ""The People That We Love"", which is best for its quality guitar sound. Also, there's ""Headful of Ghosts"" which is average at best, with ""Cold Contagious"" resemblance. Other than that, ""Inflatible"" is the only decent track, with the great melody from Rossdale. Rather than buy this, buy the first three STUDIO albums, Sixteen Stone, Razorblade Suitcase, and The Science of Things, before you're let down."
4,"Not bad in its own way, but missing alot.","This is actually not a bad album, although a couple of songs are a bit unbearable.The problem is it does'nt sound like the original Bush.For a start it sounds WAY to polished and is missing the typical loud distorted guitars that is the BUSH sound.That is why it flopped sales wise so much when it was released.If you want to hear the real BUSH get SIXTEEN STONE, RAZORBLADE SUITCASE or THE SCIENCE OF THINGS which has a different sound from the first two albums."
3,Not golden but still has some shine,"The first single off this album, ""The people that we love,"" was what made me buy this album. With its catchy guitar riffs and not-too-hard yet not-too-soft nature, it can easily make anybody a fan which is the effect it had on me. Another standout is the new release ""Headfull of Ghosts,"" which has some good guitar riffs like the next track. Track number six, ""Hurricane,"" describes post-breakup fealings as being caught in a hurricane, which I found clever. Overall, I found that some songs have catchy beats and it had numerous guitar riffs that I found noteworthy. Some tracks didn't quite keep my attention though."
3,It's Ok,"Not bad but not great, I think some of them just get a bit annoying after a while though. I downloaded ""Solutions"", ""The People That We Love"", ""Headful Of Ghosts"" & ""Hurricane"" before I got the album and loved them at the time. Its just when you listen to them too much. ""The People that we love"" is a very strong song and love it, ""Superman"" is also a great song that I got into quickly. ""My Engine Is With You"" is a very fast song, You have to keep up with it, good though. ""Float"" and ""Inflatable"" are also a couple of my faves."
4,The Almost Golden State,"After getting into Bush from their amazing ""The Science of Things"", I expected more music like this, and reminiscent of ""Sixteen Stone"" as well. While certain songs like ""The People That We Love"", ""Solutions"", & ""Superman"" hint towards that, most of album doesn't stand out to me like songs from ""The Science of Things"" did ('Warm Machine', 'Jesus Online', 'Chemicals Between Us', & 'Letting The Cables Sleep'). Altogether, after owning the album for almost a month, I can't say I regret the purchase, it's a great rock album, but the album doesn't live up on all the songs, which unfortunately is like most albums today."
4,Golden State Rocks!,"Bush's new album is great (too bad i am the only person who really likes bush around where i live). My favorite tracks are #7 #2 and #3, the other songs are pretty sweet too. I hope bush makes more videos or gives hollywood the right to use one of their songs from golden state in a movie, so that the album gets more popular. I love bush's lyrics and their trippy sounds. If you like Nickleback (their songs other than ""you remind me""), you will love bush and golden state."
3,"A good continuation of their stuff, but nothing spectacular","Golden State, overall, is not a bad album. There are some great tracks on the cd, but you get the feeling that you've heard them before. I still liked the cd, but i know that bush can do better. Its nowhere near the quality of sixteen stone, their smash hit album from 1994. To say the least, i think you should listen to a couple tracks first. These songs are most likley not going to be played on the radio, but see if you like them. The good thing is you can listen to this album the whole way through, but the songs sound quite similar. Some of the opening riffs are almost identical. Gavin Rossdale's lyrics are still a bit eerie and out there, but it gives a good grunge/alternative feel for these songs. Some of the great songs are ""headfull of ghosts"", ""the people that we love"", and most of all, ""Inflatable"". This slow song's lyrics are meaningfull and the overall performance complete."
3,Fans will get something from this,"But it's not their best. I was surprised at some of the reviews of Razorblade Suitcase--I thought it was a masterpiece. I love the first album too. This new 4th album, like the previous 3rd, is okay--it has some languid, mezmorizing moments. But the band's first two albums are a tough act to follow."
2,Just did'nt work,"Bush's 4th album ""Goldenstate"" has the tunes but not the music, the whole record sounds quite alot more washed and overly polished, missing the fantastic original sound of Bush on their first three albums."
4,A bit to polished sounding.,"Bush really needed to sound a bit rawer and real, instead of making ana album thats just a bit to fancy to sound like the real deal, that said it is certainly not bad album, and its reccomended, but its nothing like their other stuff....that could be good or a bad thing."
4,"Worst sales, Best tales","This album was thrown under the bus when no one was looking, but it is simply their best album since 'Sixteen Stone.' Whereas 'Razorblade Suitcase' was status quo and 'The Science of Things' lacked a defined album musical direction, 'Golden State' surfaces as a great comeback with hanuting yet beautiful melodies. Lyrically, it is superior to the last two records and Gavin's vocals are of course gorgeous.Listen to these three tracks and you'll marry this album: 'Solutions,' 'Inflatable,' and Bush's best song ever - 'Float.'"
4,Bush's best Album.,"This sound sunlike any of the other Bush albums, and its their best, every track matters on this album unlike Sixteen Stone which is more of a singles collection with some undeveloped songs to fill up the rest of the album, although they are certainly not bad tracks.Every track on this album, holds up pretty well, although a couple are'nt ones you would want to have overly repeated listens to.Heres Bush's best to least best albums.1. Goldenstate2. Razorblade Suitcase3. The Science Of Things4. Sixteen Stone (I'm sure many will disagree with this one being at the bottom)Of course they are all very good."
2,Almost as disappointing as Razorblade Suitcase,"After the few glimmers of hope on The Science of Things, I had high hopes for this release, but I was sorely disappointed. Most of the songs are indistinguishable from one another. There are maybe 2 somewhat enjoyable tracks. The lyrics are all over the place, and really don't flow. It would seem Gavin is more concerned with being Mr. Gwen Stefani than in producing quality music. Don't buy this, unless you want to take mine off my hands."
5,Bush: Golden State,"AWESOME! If your a bush fan your gonna love this album! They stay true to their original sound which for myself I like. If a band plays music that gives me chills (which Bush does) I don't want a change in style. If your like me, then this is a ""gotta have"" CD"
3,Bush is Back! Just as they were before!,"Bush new cd is really good if you liked their last two cds that is, I love Bush but they sound the same on every album. Its not a bad thing though. Let's face it the guys rock! I can't tell you its anything more than what they've done before, but I love it! Its worth buying if you loved their last two cds!"
3,"Bush returns, but not as good","Wait a second, were Bush ever good? I mean they had lots of hits, but really they were grunge wannabes. In this album, Bush continues with their ""grunge"" sound and comes off sounding fake. There are some good songs, but none as memorable as their older stuff."
1,The worst Bush CD by FAR,"Anybody who grew up listening to Bush would agree that they have gotten worse and worse over the years. Their first album was terrific, the second album was not quite as good but still was well worth getting, the third album had a few great songs, a bunch of okay songs, and some that sucked. Now with Golden State, Bush has created an all-time low for themselves without one single good song on the album. It's amazing, even the singles they picked for this album suck. Every minute of this CD is boring and uninspired. It's like Gavin used up every good idea he ever had. Don't bother picking this album up, it's worthless."
3,"Great CD, but...","I love this band. The CD is great. But I hate the name of this band. If they were named ""Kerry"" maybe I'd like them more."
1,These guys are softer than white bread.......,"There is something to be said for growth and progression when one is an ""artist"". These soft-boiled fools first are a pale copy of nirvana down to the angst filled lyrics (though we all know gavin ---his name is really gavin, ha ha ah--- is not really all that tortured of a soul. I thought they would be long gone by now but nooooo, here we are 2002 and we get more of this schlock. One word of advice to the members of bush,,,, hang em up boys the parties over."
4,Impressive,"Finally, a rock album with a little power behind it for a change! After being left to drown in a sea of nu-metal and other metal 'boy band' material for what seems like forever, we finally get to hear something that truly rocks! It seems unfair to brand Bush as Nirvana clones when there are so many Eddie Vedder sound alikes flying around these days. At least they've stuck to their style and haven't tried to mould their sound to be compatible with whatevers 'happenin' whis week. It's also great to hear a rock band without a rapper lurking around somewhere."
3,Its alright.,"This is Bush's fourth album, and its pretty good, its shame it dd not the air play it should of, especially compared to the other junk thats constantly rotating on the airwaves.Every track delivers, its just its far to stripped back and no individual songs really stand out that match it with their best songs. Still ""Solutions"" ""Headful of Ghosts"" ""Float"" ""Inflatable"" are all standouts."
4,Great Stage 2 Nipples... but expensive,I used this nipple from 6 months to 1 year old with my twins and my most recent infant is now using them(buying a new set for the newbie of course!). I've never had one break or fall apart and all 3 babies responded well and drank well from them. These nipples are pricey and the bottles will fit Dr. Brown wide mouth nipples but those are softer than these and seem to collapse more easily.
5,softer,"I have born free stage 1 nipples that came with the bottles, and these seem even softer, which i thought was strange. It's not a good thing or a bad thing though, just an observation. These nipples are great for my 15 week old. I noticed he was getting fussy while eating, and I think he wasn't getting milk out fast enough. Ever since he's used these, he finishes his bottle in half the time it used to take, and he's happier!"
5,Simulate Nature,I had no trouble converting my daughter from breast to bottle. They're very natural in texture and shape.
5,"great store , great product","great store great product, plan on being a customer for a long time, cant beat the prices or the service. Thanks!!!"
5,What I would expect,"We love the Born Free bottles and the nipples are no exception. I decided to order the next size up for my son and take the stage 1 nipples out of the rotation. Plus, I find it's almost always cheaper to order from Amazon! :)"
3,Great product!,"I love the born free bottles for my baby, and have had great success with their products!"
1,Overpriced! Don't buy born free bottles!!!,"Compared to Dr.Brown bottle, born free bottle is more expensive. My daughter turns to three months, I need to change the nipple levels. born free nipples cost too much, and it's not good because it makes more air than Dr. Brown. Don't buy born free."
3,mixed production ?,not a bad case for the price. the first one had a well made metal camera mounting bracket inside and was fine. the next one I ordered was a plastic mount and all 4 screws were stripped. made in china. the lens is glass. one issue is that if the camera your mounting inside it has infra-red led's for nite vison they glare off the glass and make it useless an nite.
3,look nice on the bookself,"If you are new to the world of windows NT this book is not for you(try Alan carters book windows nt 4.0). It is a tough read. I couldn't remember some of things I had just read because I was falling asleep trying to read it. If you are an administrator it is probably a good book to use as a desk reference and looks kind of nice on the shelf. It seems very through and then some, moving into topics that are not really necessary for server like osi reference model. But if you want a book that will cover a broad number of topics in addition to server topics this book is it. there are also a few chapters in the back about some of microsofts backoffice products which is good if you want some background on this products."
4,Good Technical Resource,I found the book to be very informative on all aspects of NTadministrati on and support. It is one of the few books that I haveseen that covers everythi ng from Hardware to the Microsoft Back Office. Its a excellent resource and study guide for anyone who is either training to become a MCSE or who is just intere sted in learning the fundamentals of Windows NT 4.0 deployment and support.
1,Just plain junk,"If I knew this tool was going to be this crappy, I would have bought beer instead. What a piece of junk!"
3,only a calorie counter indeed,The book does unfortunately not differentiate between the forms the calories are delivered; fat / protein / carbs !
2,dont buy,very pretty but dont put in the blinker bulb because after a few blinks it starts blowing the fuse in the cord it burned great as long as i let it burn steady.
5,Lights,"The whole family loved the lights, we kept them inside the house and I didn't have to use my own light switch, we used these beautiful lights that ligthed up the house!! The kids loved them, and we plan on leaving them to light up our NEW Year's Party..."
2,Mixed Results,"One of the spheres didn't even make it through Christmas while one is still shining bright today, January 2, 2011! On one of the spheres somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 of the globe burned out within a week of hanging it. How disappointing."
2,"Look great, when they work","I bought three of the 150 light spheres last year, but now one of them has about a third of the lights out and I can not for the life of me find the problem bulb. Look great when they work though."
3,"One half great, one half not so great.","I absolutely loved ""Night Shield"" in this book, but ""Night Moves"" did not live to author's standard's. It felt like the story was hurried up to the publisher just to put something in the book to fill up pages. The characters were not as developed as in Nora Roberts' other books, and the plot was not as interesting. Every author has a ""not so great"" story once and a while, I guess, this one is in that category."
4,Funk,"Are the only open minded people listening to dance music/electronica? This stuff is actually called ""Funk"", it consists of an accoustic band for the most part, guitars, bass, real drums and a live drummer, lead vocals, back up vocals, etc. The only qualifier I can see as to why this is marketed to the electro crowd is there is a guy spinning turntables. So the result is old school funk/live band meets Kid Loco/DJ Cam (they're from Montreal). It's different if you're not used to listening to old school funk, but one thing I like about new style funk ie Syrup, is the lack of vocals, so this isn't really covering any new ground with the exception of some scratching. They're a talented, live sounding band regardless, so if it sounds cool so far, you'll probabaly like it."
1,Bullfrog: doesn't give credit where it is due!!,"I was lucky enough to have been there for the 'live' portions of Bullfrog's new cd, and I must admit that I was dissappointed in the omission of Ben Conrad's name in the recording credits. Conrad, an experienced studio engineer, recorded the show for Bullfrog at the Justice League on April 6, 2001, yet his name does not appear on the album. This important omission ruins the integrity of Bullfrog and their album and should be the deciding factor of whether or not a person should purchase their music. The music industry doesn't need more dishonest people who participate in this sort of activity. It is time for music lovers to support musicians who are principled and give credit to those who deserve it."
2,Tired Grooves,"There are moments of brilliance on this CD, and in the group's live shows, most of which involve the interaction of the group with their world-class DJ, Kid Koala. What fills up the majority of their time however, is some rather flat, uninspired, generic ""old school"" funk. Blurum on the mic has a great voice and rhythm to spare, but his rhymes are dispassionate and forgettable. Tired jams and retread grooves lead you to wonder if this is just a colossal mismatch of talent, or if it's actually a host of good talent with nothing much to say. If you're searching for something really special to spend your money on, my advice is to keep looking."
1,Not Worth the time and money,"The picture quality is ok at most, but has a big lag with the sound. The manufacture customer rep was not helpful at all."
1,Save your money,"I wish I had never bought this USB TV Tuner. The signal strength of the cable is cut so substantially that I see more static than it is worth unless I disconnect my internet connection since they share the same cable line. Additionally when you use the remote to turn off the TV tuner it shuts down your whole computer without the opportunity to save anything so I lost a document I was working on but hadn't backed up yet (I know, should back up often but still an unexpected hastle). I would have been better off just doing a quick internet search for tv access online as there are several that you can use for little or no cost. Don't bother buying this."
4,TV tuner for PC,This unit works well on my PC - tunes in all the cable channels very well. This is a great value for the features.
3,It was not what I expected,"Spoilers ahead:I really did not expect the sharing issue. I have read alot of Leighs other books, especially her Breeds series and really liked those. I just cannot imagine a man who loves a woman wanting to share her with his friends, family, whoever! What is wrong with monogamy and hot sex?!I expected alot of sex but that seemed really toned down to. The names got on my nerves but I guess I can deal with that. Overall I will still look for Leigh's books. Enjoyed Dangerous Games."
3,Plot and storyline are so washy.,"After recently discovering Lora and her breed series I grabbed this book from the library this week. Needless to say although I'm a fast reader I skipped major portions of the book as the cohesion is less than stellar. For her major fans looking for great sex scenes then maybe this is it but the overall plot is poor.After an attack the young wman is more than willing to become involved in a sex scene with the man she loves and his two cousins? What utter nonsense and a slap in the face to those who have suffered such an atrocity.By the way the relationship is even wierder when you realize this is his stepsister and the cousins willing to share calls her mother ""aunty"".This is beyond crossing the line and truly equates women to creatures willing to do anything to please their man."
2,Whoa....,"**Didn't really care for it....Didn't like the ""sharing"" aspect....Little racey for me...Won't pass this on!"
2,trite and predictable,"Let's ignore the cutesy names for a minute - the whole Rowdy and Nauti boy theme didn't work for me - but even if the hero had been called Jack, I wouldn't have liked this book. It's completely predictable and not very well written. The sex is okay but the characters are so shallow and the writing is not above 5th grade level. I was bored after 30 pages, started skimming, then jumping, then read the end, and then thought, well that was a waste of 30 minutes. It wasn't bad or offensive or a wall banger; it was just kind of bland and not engaging. I'm not even engaged enough to hate it. So it goes gently back into the resale pile for me."
3,Well....,"I guess it wasn't toooo bad. I mean I wanted to give this a 3.5 instead. I felt as if the characters are kind of lacking. The plot is there but the characters were weak. I read this after finishing Forbidden Pleasure so yes I was a little disappointed. However, the excerpt for Dawg's book sounds pretty exciting and Natches! Can't wait to read his story.So because this is Lora Leigh, author of Forbidden pleasure, I'll give her another try."
4,Sexy Soldier Comes Home...,"I really like this first book in the series. The big, tough soldier coming home mentally wounded from war just to find his long-time love being stalked by a crazy person? Yeah, I like the damsel in distress theme in a story as much as I love a wounded hero. These two were hot, sexy, and surprisingly sweet right off the bat. I really liked that Rowdy would do anything to protect Kelly...and pretty much did.An excellent read!"
2,It's so sad that I was disappointed,"I have to agree with the previous poster. This book just wasn't what I have grown to expect from Leigh. I've read just about everything she's done and this is the first time I've walked away disappointed. Anyone who knows of her August series would expect something of the same thing from her excerpt on her home page and from the back cover, sadly, there was none of that. I fear that because Leigh is not writing under Ellora's Cave anymore that her books may continue to be toned down. I do remember reading this book was pulled for revision last year. I hope that is not the case, because her books are some of the best and hottest I've ever read. However, if she continues to pull away from the less conventional I'm afraid she'll continue to disappoint some of her most loyal fans."
3,"Not the best of the best, but not bad either","While I technically enjoyed reading this book, and the characters were likable enough, there were two common themes that started bugging me.1. The stalker. After reading For Her Pleasure, Forbidden Pleasures, Lora's Men of August series...etc., I'm tired of the overuse of the stalker. I also wasn't fond of having these cousins (the Nauti series) being related to the August brothers. Why? Not needed IMO.2. The virginal young woman being introduced into a menage a trois (or that's the plan). It's becoming a little too common for the guys to be oh so experienced while the woman comes in as a virgin. She holds back, they don't. I don't need or want to read about all-around promiscuity, but there could be a happy balance.It was an enjoyable read for sure, but I won't need to reread this one down the road."
3,not that great,its okay- i think i am over lora leigh and the threesome aspect of it all. and her being sexually traumatized didnt come off that true or realistic at all. i think this will be my last lora leigh book for awhile.
4,A Great Read,"Nauti Boy had the 3 G's. Great sex, gorgeous guys and a good story. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes those three things."
4,Good read,This is the first book i have read by this author. It was a good story and kept you interested. I look forward to the next.
5,Great Read,Thank you Ms. Cooper for another great read You really have a gift for words. May God continue to bless you. Always a message in your works
2,The future has a past,"Another book picked for our monthly book club reading. It's been a while since I read it, but I seem to remember it was ok."
5,I finally found the book,I have been searching for several years for this book.Amazon did not have it but one of the sellers that advertise with Amazon did. It was everything I wanted and more.Thanks
5,My first California Cooper book to read and I am smitten!,"This was my first reading of CC. I loved this book. It is a woman's book but men would learn a lot about how women think and feel if they read this book. The stories are sometimes sad, very very real--like what life is really like... I think Ms. Cooper is going to end up being one of my all-time favorite authors. I am a white woman who enjoys black writers, especially female writers. They can explain real life better than anyone else I have read."
5,Always Superb!,"J. California Cooper has a gift for good writing! I really enjoyed all these short stories as much as her other ones. I can't say that I have a favorite because I enjoy them all equally! This one has more of a theme in all four stories. All the women were hard, hard-working women with children to raise and doing with it no-good men. However, they all were able to find love and it was true love. That is what I like about Ms. Coopers stories, they may be stories of strength and struggle, but love always conquers. I will always be a big fan of Ms. Coopers and I hope she has many more stories and novels to come."
4,A collection of Short Stories,"This is a collections of short stories.One girl goes through life knowing love by using her body.Mothers going without to provide for their grown children and receive nothing in return.One lady thinks she is in love for the first time but the person she mistaken thinks is the one is only after her money.A man bragging about the kids he thinks he has but, rarely visit them because he thinks the mother of his children will always be waiting for him."
3,only half of the amount?,"I love stevia, I use it all the time, I thought the price for this product was great but I got the product I realized the pockets only contain half a gram (regular packets contain 1 gr). The deal is still good, but half as good as I thought ;("
1,It's true: You get what you pay for..,"The price for this product was too good to be true. Seems like every fourth packet contained nothing more than a few granules. Plus half the bag of packets were gummed up inside. I have to keep them on my stovetop near the warmth to dry them out. They must have been stored somewhere with a lot of moisture. It's too bad too, because when I actually get a decent packet to use, it makes my day (and my coffee!)"
1,Do NOT buy the Nocarb blend,The powder stuck inside of the packet and I literally had to spread the packet completely open and dip it into whatever liquid I was sweetening to get to the powder. The other one with dextin or maltodextirin flows out fine.
2,nustevia locarb blend,this nustevia is not the quality of my first purchase and contains 1/2 the product per pkg. I wish you had pointed out this difference between the locarb blend and the regular pkg. the product sticks in the pkg and it seems to take more to sweeten.
2,Sweet but Nasty,"NuStevia was one of the best I've tasted--and no bitter aftertaste. However, either the formula or packaging is faulty. The product does not tolerate heat or humidity. Of all the sweeteners I've ever kept, it is the only one to solidify in heat and humidity. The packets were rendered useless, as the sweetner hardened and stuck to the inside of the packets (I had to throw them out; a waste of money). The powder product holds up well in its plastic container but hardens to rock-like consistency if kept in a sugar bowl.I'll opt for another product."
3,Half the quantity it used to be,"I use NuStevia for years. I love the taste and usually purchase 100 packets.However, since I travel a lot, I bought 6 months ago 1000 packets of 1000mg powder each. It was great, so made another order of 1000 packets.This time, I found out that each packet contains only 500mg of Stevia powder. (It feels even less). This is not stated anywhere throughout the advertisement, so I suppose somebody decided to save without noticing the costumers. Since I have to use 2 packets in each serving, it's actually 500 packets for the price of 1000.Not very nice."
5,Great taste without tasting like a pine tree,I had this sweetener at a resort and it tasted great. Nicely sweet without the Stevia pine tree/mint aftertaste that I can't handle. I was very glad to find it here. Thanks Amazon.
4,Be Careful,"I have purchased this product several times and have been very satisfied in the past. However, this last time I did not realize that what I ordered this last time was half-sized packets. It takes two packets to sweeten what previously took one packet. Be careful, as the price for both sizes of 1,000 packets is about the same. This product seems to work well with my low carb diet."
4,"Very tasty, very light after taste","I've tried other stevia products before, and I've been turned off by the after taste. I did end up using a liquid stevia for a few months, and built up my tolerance to the after taste as I was trying to eliminate as much sugar as possible from my diet, but my coffee never really tasted all that good. With NuStevia, my coffee tastes almost as good as it did with the sugar. Now, keep in mind that I did build up a tolerance to the after taste of an inferior stevia product, so if you're switching from sugar it might not be tasty for you to begin with, but of the varieties of Stevia I've tried, this one has worked out the best for me.I took away a star because its not as tasty as cane sugar, but very few things in life are."
3,less is more?,This is the second order that I have placed for NuStevia packets. In the past one packet had the taste equivalent of 2 plus spoons of sugar. I usually used 1/2 to 3/4 in a mug of coffee. This shipment which I opened today seems to have much less product in each packet. So much less that for the same taste equivalent I now need TWO packets to sweeten the same mug of coffee! The product still tastes good I simply do not like the fact that the product has effectively doubled in price by having less sweetener in each packet.
1,Is this a joke?,"I bought this about a week ago and I got it on friday ,when I opened it and saw that the packets contained less than half of the regular normal ones,I just repackaged it request a return label and soon I will send them back ...I've never had this experience with the other 1000 packet stevia the packets were nice and full ,but back then it costed $37 dls. now it's $60 ..so that's the only reason I bought this other 1000 packets ,but I know better now ,I have no idea why would amazon sell something like this ,this is stealing from the costumer ,I just hope they stop selling that item."
2,Beware: There are two types of NuStevia,"I tried and really liked the NuStevia white powder packets, so I ordered 1000 packets of what I thought was the same thing. Instead I got NuStevia ""NoCarbs Blend"", which contains something called erythritol instead of the maltodextrin which is found in the ""white powder"" version. I knew something was wrong after the first cup of coffee and bowl of cereal. The NoCarbs blend isn't as sweet, and tasted bitter to me. Perhaps the version without maltodextrin necessary for those who can't have ANY carbs, but if you're just trying to find an alternative to the yellow-packet stuff,go with the ""white stevia powder"" version. Tastes much better."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with some of the other negative reviews here. I was wondering why most of the packets are almost empty. I normally purchase this item in a retail store but when I saw this great price on Amazon for buying in bulk I thought I would be getting the same merchandise. Turns out the packets are the same size, but if you look closely they read 500mg. I compared this to a packet I purchase elsewhere and they contain 1gram of the Stevia power. I don't see anywhere on this page where it lists the actual amount. I will go elsewhere."
2,Stevia,"We have been buying Stevia from Amazon for several years. However, the last two shipments of the product have packets in them that have very little product inside. Some of the packets are completely empty. Amazon has made this right with us. I have suggested they bring this to the attention of the manufacture as they may not be aware of the problem."
2,Swindle,"Although the price was good,the amount in each package was less than half of the amount I received when I ordered directly from NuNatural."
2,"not the ""regular"" nustevia","I thought I was ordering the regular nustevia, but this is no carb blend which only holds half the amount in each packet. Doesn't make it bad, only different. I needed to use twice as much."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR,"I love this product, it's the best Stevia in the market. The price for this product was too good to be true. Every packet contained nothing more than a few granules, at least half of what the normal packet should have. So I am using 2 packets instead of one and even 2 packets is not as much as the regular one packet."
2,Perhaps a different version?,"I have always liked Henny Penny as a good example of the foolishness of assuming that news broadcasts are accurate, which is an especially good lesson in today's world.This particular edition is the variation of the story in which [warning: spoiler ahead] Henny Penny and her friends are eaten by Foxy Loxy and his family. In today's world of fluffed up fairy tales, Henny Penny should probably be rewritten to have received some other consequence other than being barbequed.I was not impressed with Paul Galdone's illustrations. The sketchy style of the pen and ink details and the quick strokes of brush color give it an air of being hastily done. I think I will find some other versions and compare them."
5,brought back memories of the book i had when I was little,I bought the book to read to my niece. It brought back so many memories of when I was a child
5,A Parent's Favorite!!!,I remember reading this book as a child and still love it!!! I was happy when my son's teacher placed it on his reading list. It's very much a classic!!!
3,a bit disapointed...........,"I like this piece but it really is very very slim , small , and maybe not worth th e price . It does look nice but it is not a braclet that is all that noticeable. I am going to keep it , but have to ""pair it "" with other braclets for any effect ............"
2,MIRACLE,"I enjoy the Winans very much, this DVD I did not enjoy, and is more of a home video that maybe the Winans would enjoy of their early days. If I'd had a chance to preview this DVD I would not have purchased it. THANK YOU"
3,The Winans - The Lost Concert,"This is the only live performance available of the Winans, therefore I consider it to be a collector's item. The video and sound quality are both subpar but, with it is still a rare gem."
2,Hmmm....,I love the Winans which is why it kills me to have to give this DVD such a low rating (as I expected more). Didn't live up to my expectations...which is truly sad :(Rick
3,4 out of 16 is not that good,"I only enjoyed 4 out of the 16 performances...""Goodness, Mercy and Grace"", ""Question Is"" - MY FAVORITE!, ""If I Labor"", and ""Restoration"". I don't advise ANYONE to pay over $10 for this dvd."
5,no mess painting!,"We got these from Grandma for a gift. All three of my kids love them. I can even let my 20 month old paint without hovering. I haven't noticed the paint staining the clothes, and we have had them a few years--although it could be the paint just hasn't got on the clothes.There is not the problem of mixing colors, losing brushes, or drying out (as markers do when the lids are left off). I plan to get some for my nephew, who is 3 for Christmas!"
1,Stains! DO NOT BUY! NOT WASHABLE,"Do not be fooled. These are NOT WASHABLE! They bleed and stain and some colors even stay on skin. nothing will remove this ""Dye"" if it bleeds even the smallest amount. One drop will cause a disaster in your home and laundry."
5,A Great Soundtrack,"I think that the Faculty Soundtrack is great! It has very good songs. I was disappointed with the last track which is a wordless introduction to the first track. But Neve's ""It's Over Now"" and Stabbing Westward's ""Haunting Me"" as well as all of the other songs more than make up for that last track. I highly recommend watching the movie and getting the soundtrack."
5,an awesome soundtrack,"this is a kick butt soundtrack i did not see the movie but i have the soundtrack! I didnt really like the fact because some people redid songs but i got it anyway. when i went home and put it in my cd player i thought ""oh great a crapy cd with crapy cover songs"" but i was wrong. i was amazed at how well the whole thing was put together. so if ya can buy it it kix!!!!!"
3,"The covers are really, really, really, really bad!","The Class of '99 sound liked stoned, brain-dead teenagers doing the pink floyd covers. There was no passion in their vioces. The rest of the songs are good, but it would be a 5 STAR soundtrack if the had used the orginals."
5,The Faculty Soundtrack,Its just plain out and simply greeeat It totaly rocks I really love the whole cd if your into rock and or punk rock this is the cd for you!
3,"It's not the best soundtrack, but if you buy it,...","buy it for ""Medication"" by GARBAGE. That song makes the sdtk. recieve 3stars from me."
4,A good collection of redone songs by some great bands.,"This is really a CD to buy if you like the bands on it and like the bands being redone.I espicially liked the Class of 99 (Layne Stally, Tom Morrelo etc.. etc.. ) Another brick in the wall by Pink Floyd.Creed, Offspring and Soul Assulm songs are all good too.Buy this one if you can."
5,Great Album!!!,"The Faculty soundtrack is definitely one of the best soundtracks available. Best tracks-Another Brick in the Wall by Class of '99, It's Over Now by Neve, Changes by Shawn Mullins, and Maybe Someday by Flick. Go out and buy this!!"
4,Wickedly Awesome Soundtrack,"The movie was great, in a corny but satisfying way. I think that part of the reason I watched the whole movie was because of how great of a soundtrack it had. After I had seen the movie a few times I had decided to buy this soundtrack. I totally fell in love with it. I love how soundtracks can open you up to new kinds of music and even points of view. I would suggest this soundtrack to anyone who liked the movie enough to watch it more than once!"
5,"Neve's ""It's Over Now"" is best track","While the movie was only so-so, this disc is aweseome. Ton's of great music from a bunch of artists.But don't miss Neve. ""It's Over Now"" is an absolutely great song. Make sure you check them out. They're also on another soundtrack with another song. Pick up the ""Here On Earth"" soundtrack for more Neve. Go Buy both of the CD's!"
3,Far from the mist of Avalon!,"I must admit I am not finished reading the book. I'm on page 375. The story so far has been intreging enough to keep my nose in it for the last day. The only thing I have a hard time with is the relationship with Evalia. They are very strange to each other even close to the end. Maybe it has something to do with the ending or Im missing somthing. Anywho.... It has been a great read so far although I seem not to have a tight bond with any of the charaters, maybe because its like that not to give the story away untill the end. I dunno. But again a great read. I will give a full reveiw after I finish all. I couldn't help myself;}"
4,Puppy Food,"We used this product for our puppy's first year. She never had an issue with any type of adverse reaction and seemed to enjoy it very much.Actually, she liked this product even better than the adult food we are now using. Our puppy would eat this straight from the bag!!!! No need to mix anything else into it...It kept our little girl healthy, bright and beautiful! Helping her grow into the strong doggie teen (she will be 2yrs old in june) she is now!!!Kept a nice coat, good breathe and healthy teeth...Really liked this product."
1,"I am a Gansky fan, but I didn't like this one","Gansky's writing is unique and keeps your interest. But at the end of the book, I felt as if the story was not complete. Read Vanished or Distant Memory to get a better sense of his creativity."
3,"Dated, yet a good read.","This dated, 1970 book is a fun read for Mr Field's educational observations on his ingredients, origin of his recipes, and his solid explanation of preparing them.There are 150 some recipes in this 372 page book, so you know he likes to write, and it's a pleasant read. There are no pictures, and the recipes have nearly all been in McCalls or Holiday magazine in the 60's, so there are simple or simplified generally ""comfort-food"" recipe versions, and the meals should be tasty just the same.He is a well respected teacher, and edited the Time/Life Foods of the World series, so his commentary is no less valid today."
2,Spontaneous breakage,"These glasses, although beautiful, crack and shatter with little or no provocation.Very disapointing."
2,"Pretty, but not functional","I've been shopping on Amazon regularly for years and haven't bothered to review a product, but I felt it was important to warn folks away from these glasses.I'll start with the Good:They are heavy, and appear to be high quality - they look fantastic and will impress your guests.The Bad:They crack easily and react poorly to temperature changes. I poured some chilled vodka and ice into one of these glasses last week and when I picked the glass up, it split apart. I've never quite seen anything like it, it looked as if someone had taken a samurai sword and sliced the thing in half! The bottom crashed down unto my foot while I stood there soaked in vodka staring dumbly at the top half of the glass.If you're looking for purple glasses that look nice on your table, these are winners. If you plan on using them and don't want your guests soaked, move along friend."
4,Plum Artland Glasses,I received my glasses on time. They were very well packaged. The glasses are a nice size. Would have rated them a five expect the ones I received are much darker than what is pictured. The bubbles can only be seen when held up to a light source.
4,Nice,The first set I had bought awhile back had thicker glass...the latest set I bought had much thinner glass...not happy with that~
4,A little pricey but nice.,"These bubble glass tumblers are really fun. Nice size for adults with a ""not to heavy"" base. Really like the bubble glass, but think they were a little pricey. Comparables were not available until after the holidays so I bought them anyway. Not dissappointed."
2,A lovely mess,"I loved the look and feel of these glasses. They got many compliments from visitors. I've had mine for about a month now, and one of them cracked tonight when I poured cold water into it. Fortunately, the glass didn't shatter, but it is completely unusable. Something about the way these glasses are made causes them to crack and break for no reason. Of course, now I see the other reviews bringing up this problem, too, but it's too late for me. It's not too late for you! You're better off buying a sturdier glass elsewhere."
5,Great look and quality,"Really happy. Love the hand blown look! Definitely would recommend! Nice weight to them, not too heavy! Color is exactly as shown."
5,Perfect!,I ordered these for a special birthday gift. They were a little larger than I expected...no problem! They are great!
2,Disappointed....glasses don't look like picture,"I ordered the light green. They look like the green glasses from Mexico that have matching pitchers, which is fine, however not what I expected nor had hoped for. They are nothing like the picture, with the nice light and dark green contrast. The glasses I received are solid green. The website picture looks more artsy/classy. They seem to be nicely made. Although a made in China sticker is on the bottom of each glass. I prefer to buy USA products, so that too was disappointing. Wonder if the other pretty plum and turquoise glasses look like their pics? Maybe I'd like them better. Not going to chance it, though."
3,"Last about 5 years, then crack","I purchased these Artland glasses about 5 years ago. I love how they look, how heavy they are, and their large capacity. But 5 years seems to be as long as they're made to last - suddenly, mine have started randomly cracking. I've had to throw away about 8 of them within a couple months' time. I haven't changed anything at all about how I'm caring for them; it seems they are just at the end of their life span. Haven't decided whether or not to buy them again - I do love how they look, but to me, 5 years isn't that long to hold up, especially considering how much they cost."
5,Perfect,I didn't know what to get my wife for her birthday. She likes a lot of cultural events. I got these glasses for her and she adores them.
1,Bad News,This looks pretty and worked for a couple months so i ordered another.As soon as i ordered the new one the old one stopped lighting becauseof something going on at the end of the tube. I could only light it with a match.Drained it and did all that good stuff and didn't help.I sent it back to a place called 'Intergral' out of Florida.They 'repaired' it which amounted to having the same defect untouchedwith an additional defect which had Butane gas leak abundantlyand noisily out the back end. A pretty but pretty poor lighter with horrid service.
5,Perhaps The Best,"A few years ago, I became acquainted with the mesmerizing, Islamic poet of love, Rumi, and since then he has become, hands down, one of my favorites. His mystical poems are spiritual, universal, and sensuous in nature. They have been translated into many languages; he has been described as one of the most popular poets in American libraries today. I found this volume to be one of the best."
5,sandwich knife/speader,Have you looked for one of these things lately? Used to carry them in grocery stores the country over...not any more. I finally found this one on good old Amazon. It was inexpensive and it has a serrate edge that is perfect for slicing bread or cutting the sandwich in half. Nice wide rounded blade for spreading. Good bamboo handle that will take being washed over and over for years.
3,Tokyo Joe,"Let's be up front, this is NOT a Bogie classic. It is entertaining & it's an interesting role for him. The story takes place in Japan shortly after WWII. Bogie returns there to reclaim a business that he had prior to the beginning of hostilities. Along the way he gets involved with some unscrupulous individuals who want him to do some illegal things. Of course, Bogie isn't very compliant so he works a double cross. There is an ex involved who has since married an American who is there. The judo fight scene at the end of the movie between Bogie & a Japanese henchman is a hoot. Quality of the dvd is very good."
3,TOKYO JOE,"Bogie is GREAT,as always. Not in the same caliber as Casablanca, and at times tries to be. The Judo scene between Ito and Bogie is a RIOT!"
5,IN LOVE!!!,"Because of my bra size (36 DD) I've always had problems finding good bra's...I discovered wonderbra 7234 while I was in holidays in the US, and I can't live without them since!it's the perfect combination between push-up (having an ample bosom doesn't mean you don't need a little push), comfort, sexy design, good quality and affordable price!I just bought 8 of them! i just hope wonderbra will continue to make this WONDERFUL model!! :)"
2,Not the best,"The band fits very well, but the straps are very short. I'm a 34B and I had the straps as long as they could get and it was still a struggle to even get it on. They were digging into my shoulders after only a few hours, making it very uncomfortable. I've never had this problem with a bra before-I have other wonderbra's (that are also pushups) that don't do this so I'm very disappointed."
1,Not right to size..,My husband bought this bra for me... and I'm a 34B... and it just didn't fit.. and not only that the strap broke within days... the center part in the picture.. is not there.. this is not a correct picture of the product... I'm disappointed ... I'm having my husband get a refund..
1,What Happened To Wonderbra?,"Worst Wonderbra ever purchased. The fit is horrible. The straps are too short, even when extended to fullest length they are very tight. The cups are stiff and bulky, suppose to be gel but didn't feel like gel at all. Very disappointing. It was not true to size at all."
2,"Fit is way off (in my size, at least)","I purchased this bra based on the rave reviews I found on other websites. Now, this could be a fine bra in other sizes, and perhaps for those in my size with a lot of fullness on top (or augmented). But for me the fit was way off (34D). Too much padding for that cup size. Also, the shape of the bra was not as pictured. It cut across horizontally like a balconette, not a plunge bra as pictured."
2,Much smaller than my current bra (exactly same model),"My cat chewed up the strap of my black Wonderbra that I loved, so I went online to hunt for another one. I found it on Amazon, and happily ordered it. However, the one I received (same size and model as my old one) is a lot smaller. I have to adjust the straps out to the maximum length...and it's still almost not long enough. ?? Rather than go through the hassle of returning it I decided to give it a try, but I'm sorry I did. Now I cannot use my contraption that turns it into a crossback bra because the straps are not long enough."
3,Runs small and didn't like the way it was packaged,"Runs small in size and the strap is a little short. When I got the bra, it was folded in a way so that one of the cup had this line in it that disfigured the bra. I tried one at a store a bigger size and it fits better so I returned the one from amazon. I do love the bra, just don't get it from amazon."
2,Cute Bra...Runs Small in Size!,Purchased this bra along with a pair of gel inserts for a little extra lift. Very pleased with the price of the bra and the quality (considering the cost) but found the size to be extremely small. I am normally a full C-cup anywhere else but this bra was sized like a B and the straps were to tight even after adjusted.
3,Pretty print,"Print is pretty and does not show through tops. Cups are natural looking. Straps are a little squeezy, though. They compress a little too much by the underarms because of the strap placement. Probably would not buy again but will continue to wear into bra rotation."
4,Groove & Chill in One Set,Good quality stuff. I liked the movement between stylin groove and hoppin chill. 3 discs for whatever your mood might be.
4,Muzzled- the truth of PC (Political Correctness),"Smerconish has it right on the ball, most of the time. As the old saying goes, ""If walks like a duck, quacks like a duck,..."" Several years ago, I diagnosed myself as being ""politically dysfuntional""- Much the same thing, only ahead of my (our) time. He seems to be obsessed with continually connecting this 'Muzzled' phenomenom with the terrorism crisis. Maybe to some degree, but... Interesting rainy day reading."
3,"Political Correctness, or Politeness?","Michael Smerconish makes a few good loose ended points, and I commend him for letting his opinion ring thorugh the minds of evry reader wh oagrees with him. But is it wrong to be polite and unbigoted in a multicultured country? I saw him this morning on The View, and all I can conclude is that he is an educated, highly-opinionated, racist. He seemed to have a problem with being poilitcally correct about Islamic extremism and Black people but that was not so for Jews...hmm makes you wonder.We have to keep in mind that we do live in a diverse world. It's taken so long to get the idea of White Supremecy out of our minds, and I feel that this man just brings it all back to the, unfortunately, narrow minded and ignorant people in this nation who can't really think for themselves.However, I still value Mr. Smerconish's opinions and views. He has inspired me to write a book of my own."
1,"Terrible, horrid, total waste of money.",Don't buy this book. Your money well be better spent elsewhere.
2,Doesnt work on my nails,I have a hard time keeping polish on my fingernails. I have tried several different types of base and top coats and thought since this one is an OPI it would be great. I have used it a couple different times with different brands of polish and the polish chips off much faster than the others.
4,Love OPI products,"I generally like all OPI products. This one is pretty good, since you can use it for three purposes at the same time."
1,Worst nail polish ever!,This nail polish is not shiny and it drys sticky. Worst OPI etter yet wort nail polish ever. I think $1.00 Wet n Wild may be better!!! You guys should stop selling it.
3,all right,This product serves as a better top coat than a base coat. I found that my nail polish chipped more when I used it for both base and top coats than when I used a different base coat and this as the top coat. I saw no difference in nail strength when I used it alone.
4,Unabashed pop-rock whimsy,"Rarely does derivative conjure a positive light, but in the case of Mercury Rev, imitation has led to emulation. If the Flaming Lips do not follow up their relatively average latest release, we might see the comparisons begin to flip judging by this strong disc. Breathy production, excellent bass-work, and some acquired vocals from a powerfully timid singer make up their secret arsenal of weapons, transporting ordinary structured songs into elevated musical celebrations."
3,"Too poor to be as good as ""Deserter's Songs""","This was the album that some critics aclaimed as a masterpiece.I was one of the first people to purchase it the first day it was out (what a fool..).OK, that doesn't mean that it isn't good at all but it's full of cliches and it sounds so unfinished.There are many good tracks in here but the majority of the songs is really poor.Better luck next time you guys."
4,"softest known landing, flailing and felled: secret review #5","An album certainly. A digital introduction of tones and lines. Perhaps the numbers crawl and build pottery office buildings, seventy stories of clay and middle management. Without the backboards, this album finds itself a chucker, a clear morningedsky, a test match reminding us of overnight, and the threats that music can make.for more secret reviews: secrettechnology (plus com)."
3,Beats? YES. Lyrics? NO!,"BOTTOM LINE:This album would make an EXCELLENT instrumental joint or a mixtape. But Large Pro will never be accused of being a tight rapper. It was painful to listen to him read his lyrics off the paper. It was that obvious. The guests by Busta, Tip, and Nas helped immensely! Still got luv for Extra P tho."
3,Eh,"Some of these songs actually are nice. Most of them, however, particularly Rhythm and Northern Light, are repetitive and homogeneous. It would be nice to have some variety in regards to the vocals. There is next to no instrumental diversity. I won't deny that the album as a whole sounds pleasant, but it's not much more than this. Listen to Hello, Dear Wind instead; even though it came out less than a year after Come, I'm a Lion, it is a vast improvement."
3,Too good to be true?,"The first question that pops in your mind after reading this slim volume: Is this for real?... for such are the goodies offered in return for such little effort... But then the first thing the author says is:""If you stubbornly cling to the idea that such things are impossible, reading this book will be a waste of your time"" After all, trying out something as harmless as his prescriptions can't take too much out of you... The promised payoff is too tempting! Me? I am giving it a try! Check with me after a month!"
5,Mini Tabletop Christmas Ornament Tree,"After deciding to downsize my Christmas decorations this year, I ordered the Gold Star Mini Regent Tabletop Christmas Ornament Tree to replace the traditional Christmas tree. I selected my favorite ornaments to hang on the tree and have displayed it on the table behind my sofa, where it is noticeable in the entire room.I am very pleased with the decorative ornament tree and expect to use it for many years to come! It holds about 15-18 ornaments depending on the size."
3,Movie has a twist,"This movie has great acting and great effects. It's not your cheesy drama/horror type film. The movie does have a twist. I was surprised at the ending. I gave this movie a three star. Becuase, their is movies similar to this. I felt like this movie is a combination of a Lifetime movie, mixed with horror."
4,CLEVER SHOCKER THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU!,"'The Uninvited' starts out like so many other stories of this nature and makes you feel very comfortable. I think that is part of its cleverness to let your guard down and think you know what to expect. There are many scenes where you know what's coming, but still made me jump! The acting is very good for this type of film and I have to admit I was surprised at the ending. The film has a few good shocks, creepy images, brisk pacing and the last quarter of the film completely validates the cliché's that plague the rest of the film. 'The Uninvited' is a very good shocker with a few great surprises!"
2,Completely predictable,"If you can't see whats coming from the get go, then you haven't been watching ""Horror"" movies for the last 10 years. Can we stop recycling these tired, once original concepts which are now completely cliched please?"
3,Invitingly good.,"This movie felt like the classic old ghost stories Hollywood used to make. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and film style. This was a great thriller. Honestly, I was expecting it to be a horror film, but I didn't read the back either. What I got was a pleasant surprise- a psychological suspense movie with a bit of jumps here and there.The ""tale of two sisters"" within the film is actually quite touching. I really enjoyed the sister's chemistry - it was very authentic. What great young actresses! It made the twist ending all the more powerful!I would have given it another star - but after watching it I had a strange feeling I had seen it before. It kind of made me think of The Sixth Sense and The Others. So the twist wasn't all that unique really. What made it special was the girls interaction with each other and the moody atmosphere. That made it definitely recommendable!"
3,"remake of an Asian film,","i was skeptical of this movie at first,for two reason reasons.number one is that it is a remake of an Asian film,which usually doesn't bode well.number two is that it seems we have been flooded with movies of this genre the last few years.neither my friend nor i had seen the original,and it would cost us nothing but our time,so we thought,what the heck,let's give it a shot.turns out it wasn't half bad,once it got going,just after the 40 minute mark.from that point on,things start happening,and a good little mystery begins to develop.Elizabeth Banks,who is a very good comedic actress,shows some great dramatic ability here.i would have given this movie a 4 if it hadn't taken so long to get going.hence 3/5"
4,The Uninvited,"Anna returns home after spending time in the hospital following the tragic death of her mother. Her recovery suffers a setback when she discovers her father has become engaged to her mother's former nurse. That night, Anna is visited by her mother's ghost, who warns her of Rachel's intentions. Together, Anna and her sister try to convince their father that his current fiancee is not who she pretends to be, and what should have been a happy family reunion becomes a lethal battle of wills between stepdaughters and stepmother. This is a good movie, the twists and turns in this movie came to a unpredictable ending which is really good."
3,good thriller nice plot twist,"good movie with strong, very talented cast.the story is told at a good pace and keeps the viewer's attention. the plot has a nice twist and the movie is entertaining as a thriller."
5,Definitely a mental case movie,If you like getting tricked by mental patients this is your movie. I was shocked at the ending where the camera changed her clothes with a sudden realization she was no longer the victim here.
4,Really Enjoyed it!,"The movie is well done, and frankly, it has a good twist. There is sufficient enough re-direction in the plot that it kept my 'willing suspension of disbelief' going until the end. I think the movie is well worth seeing. A lot better than most."
3,attention: this is not an alvin and the chipmunks movie,"I was confused by the title and thought this was an alvin and the chipmunks movie. turns out this is not an alvin and the chipmunks movie. I'm not saying this is a good movie or a bad movie, it's just not an alvin and the chipmunks movie. Hope this helps clear things up for people."
2,"Mildly interesting, but not particularly ""thrilling""","Horror movie fans aren't likely to find it anything particularly out of the ordinary. The last fifteen minutes of the movie are okay, but you have to stick with it for a long time to get that far.It's really a difficult movie to review, because I can't find anything overtly good or bad about it. I was in ""ho hum"" mode for most of it, and kept telling my husband, ""Maybe we should just shut it off and find another one to watch."" The acting wasn't bad, the film wasn't bad, nothing was acutally ""bad."" It was just boring to the nth degree up to the end. The ending is the only reason I give it two stars. That being said, the ending has been done much better in several other movies, so I couldn't give it three."
2,I wouldn't recommend even renting this,"Definitely suspenseful and a bit scary and creepy, but the plot was predictable and so were all the twists in it. The girl who played Anna had distracting lips. I felt like I was watching an Angelina Jolie wannabe. There are holes in the story, and I didn't really enjoy it excluding the few frightening jumps it gave me. Get it as a freebie with a coupon or at a redbox on Mondays with a promo code like I did."
2,"Been there, done that!!! Hollywood's unoriginal version....","Well Hollywood does it once again by attempting to take a foreign film and adapting it to the mainstream market. Without going into detail, (don't want to spoil the movie) if you have already seen the original Korean version ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" this remake will feel like a let down, and will not ""thrill"" you since you already know the plot before the movie even begins. Hollywood followed the original Korean version almost to the letter, and I assume they bought the rights in order to do so.The original version is far superior to this remake in my opinion, but if you simply cannot tolerate movies with subtitles or have no interest in Asian cinema, then this version maybe worth a peek. I would recommend waiting for the DVD release. 2 stars for its lack of originality."
1,We SHOULD NOT have INVITED this movie into our Friday night at the theatre,"My friend treated me to this movie on a Friday night.There are no suspenseful or scary scenes here.There are a couple of twists. The worst thing is at the end, I found out the main female actor killed people because of her hallucination!The film is ridiculous because it contains so many illogical holes.We SHOULD NOT have INVITED it into our Friday night at all."
3,Has a Good Twisted Ending,"With: Emily Browning, Arielle Kebbel, David Strathairn and Elizabeth BanksThe Uninvited was a fairly scary movie and the acting was pretty good. The story follows Anna on her journey home fresh from the asylum where she takes up with her sister to rid the household of her father's girlfriend whom they fear is a murderer and has doom in store for them.There are a few twists and turns that keep the story engaging and some parts of it were fairly frightening. The actress who played Anna, also starred in A Series of Unfortunate Events, was good in this film too.I found the plot to be entertaining - and you might figure it all out or you might be quite surprised by the ending as I was was."
4,Good thiller,"This is a well made thriller about a girl whose mother died horribly and whose dad takes up with the woman who had been a caregiver to the mother, who was ill before her death. There is good family drama going on, along with the mystery of whether the young girl is telling the truth or if she is merely sliding back into psychosis.Good stuff, and decent performances."
4,"Not amazing, but pretty good","About 1 to 2 years ago, this used to be my favorite horror movie, and movie in general. I was basically obsessed with it. It had amazing cinematography, creepy scenes, and an ending you don't see coming, but as ""Paranormal Activity"" came into the mainstream, that quickly became my absolute favorite and I started to forget about ""The Uninvited"". I also realized that the ending really wasn't anything new to psychological horror, but it still has it's twists that make it different from other psycho-horrors. ""The Uninvited"" is based on a 2003 South Korean horror film, called ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". It's another one of those American horror films that are remakes of Asian films, but out of all the others, (""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"", ""One Missed Call"", etc.), this is one of the smartest remakes. It has creepy pop-outs and nice suspense all the way to it's fulfilling ending. Altogether, it isn't my favorite horror movie, but maybe it's somewhere in my top 10."
4,Eerie.. but with a twist of an ending!!!,"So I am one of those people who absolutely love horror movies, even the crappy ones like 'The Ring'. So with this movie I had no idea what it was about until me and my cousin rented it.For those who don't know 'The Uninvited' is about two girls, one of which has been recently released from a psychward after the strange death of their mother. They both start investigating the past of their father's new girlfriend (who happens to have been their mothers former nurse). Later they come to the conclusion that she setup the murder of their mother and they try and get people to believe them.Anyways, I would reccomend this movie to most people who love the creepy kinds of movies. It really isn't a movie that makes you want to have bad dreams for a week, but their are a few parts thay could be certified as 'creepy'. Furthermore, the movie is really good especially the ending!(which happens to be one of the biggest twists I have ever seen in a movie!"
1,Redone Over & Over Again,"Nothing original in this movie that hasn't been so many times I'm going to die of overexposure. Same trite story of girl leaves mental hospital because of tragedy in family comes home to a dysfunctional household. The twist, copied from another movie, that I forget at the moment (must also have been bad) is the presence of a another person as seen though the eyes of ex-mental hospital girl except this other person doesn't exist and you aren't suppose to learn that until the end. Everything is boringly cliched and predictable to that point. Conclusion - one star for copy cat film making."
3,A Bit Lame,"This felt like a low budget movie. Nothing special, nothing overly scary, nothing really that entertaining. Its ok for a rental, but not worth buying."
1,Awful,"Most of the The Uninvited suffers from the kind of contrived predictability you'd expect of a Lifetime TV movie. Even the implausible plot twist at the end can't redeem it. Avoid unless you enjoy being frustrated, intellectually insulted and wasting your time."

5,Good Book,"If you play blitz chess or even 10 or 15 minute games regularly like me, this is definitely a good book. It includes invaluble lessons on what to do with certain amounts of time on your clock, and some different openings, that while not neccesarily the most sound opening to try in a slow game, are perfect for intuitive tactics to come out of in five minute games. Get this book if you like blitz chess!"
1,Truly Dreadful,"The advice is unoriginal, unethical at times and overall, this book is a waste of time and money.The recently released ""Bullet Chess"" by Nakamura and Harper is a delight to read, very entertaining and for those truly interested in improving their Blitz game, the one to get."
4,Bizarre cornball but still entertaining,"Yes,virginia,there REALLY is a song on this cd entitled""It takes a tough man to kill a chicken""...likewise there is also a bizarre littly ditty entitle""She looked like Judy Garland""...these story-songs are unique little gems,and artists pete chambers and travis wetzel aren't bad as musicians either...All in all I would have to say that this particular album just cannot be classified...it ain't country,or bluegrass,although elements of both abound..neither is it the sort of Harry Chapin story-telling that most story-telling items like to compare themselves to..It defies any effort to specificly describe it's content,beyond the fact that it is amusing,in its way,and well done"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,Mine arrived hard as a rock. It was old stock. I bought it the second time in an actual store so I could feel the tube to see if it was dried up before buying it.
4,long but not forgotten memory,"the watermellon explosions were a misterious memory till i recently rented this film and realized it was one of the few my family owned when i was a child. this may have been the cause of many childhood nightmares, but i do attribute my early film viewings to my present unorthodox state of cognition.i now love david cronenberg's film."
1,not worth the price of the DVD,"I am not reviewing the movie itself (though it is not one of Cronenberg's better films) but the DVD media. I am so disappointed in the quality of this DVD. The picture is lame and the sound is just awful. I have great equipment (TV, stereo surround, etc.) and then I see this! I know the movie is from 1970 and low-budget, but there should have been some ""bump-up"" in sound quality, at the very least, for the DVD release."
2,Not My Favorite...,"I became a big fan of Cronenberg after renting Naked Lunch and Videodrome, and I started buying his movies. Then I bought this movie, and I wish I hadn't. The problem may have been that I expected Shivers to be an extremely high quality movie like the two aforementioned movies, but it is not. It is, in my opinion, a run of the mill B horror movie. It is bloody, and has Cronenberg's characteristic sexual content but after watching it once I knew that I wasn't going to be watching it again for a LONG time. I found myself laughing at it more than anything. If you are one who finds these movies amusing for comic relief, you'll probably like this movie more than I did. It is worth seeing once, but I wish I would have just rented this movie instead of buying it."
2,Guess What?,Cronenberg is a thief. Who has he robbed you ask? William S. Burroughs. He told on himself when he raped Ol'Bill's novel Naked Lunch by trying to turn it into a film. Just read Cities of the Red Night and then watch Shivers. You'll get what I mean.
3,Slugs and sex,"For those of you that like Cronenberg movies, you won't be disappointed. This is an earlier film by this director. It has the usuals that you would expect from this director: lots of sexually oriented material and wierdness. I did enjoy this movie, but mostly because it was silly and easy to laugh at. The acting is poor, and the plot is your usual Cronenberg wierdness. It has the feel of many of the zombie movies, altough with sex instead of explicit gore (ie. Zombie, Day of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, etc). If you like Cronenberg movies, this is a must see. If you don't know how you feel about him, move on to something else."
3,DVD version has problems,"One of my favorite Cronenberg films...raw, low-budget fun. HOWEVER, the DVD has pixelization and artifacting. It's not the worst I've seen, but it is annoying. I suggest buying the VHS version from Anchor Bay instead...clear, crisp and perfect. IMAGE ENT should take more care in their DVD releases if they want to compete with the majors. Disappointing."
3,A hint of whats to come,"David Cronenberg's (DC) first comercial film is given a surprisingly clear transfer, though there is some pixelation and glitching in a late scene that I don't recall being on the LD release, it *may* be a problem on my DVD copy.Really the first film in the resurgence of biological horror movies. In many ways this is one of the inspirations for ALIEN, aparently Dan O'Bannon even cites to it directly.All of DC's prime issues are here, even the twins and some of the social issues from Dead Zone. In many ways this really feels like the seed from which many of DC's later work will grow. At times the film is clumsy and it's 70's independent budget and style haven't really aged well but a lot of this can be forgiven because of the doors this film opened. In it's way it is as important as Haloween or Eraserhead, of course that also means that it has a small but devoted audience.Long Live the New Flesh!!!"
3,Early Work by One of Cinema's Greats,"Not one of Cronenberg's best, but passable. It feels like the film was not pure Cronenberg, as if he was forced to bow to outside pressures of producers, etc or he simply had not fully developed his vision. The teeth just don't seem as sharp as they should. Standard Cronenberg body horror combined with an interesting post-Sexual Revolution anxiety make for an interesting watch. Plus, the only other place I'd ever seen Joe Silver was on reruns of Match Game '77."
4,Terror-ific film but the DVD has problems,"I love this disturbing and entertaining film. I too, noticed the pixelization and artifacting on the DVD expecially in the beginning moments of the film. I'll get the LD for good measure. In respect, this is Cronenberg's champion starter. How scary the idea of parasites and disease and utter chaos relate to current events. Notice there is hardly any characters to ""root for"" apart from the bewieldered doctor on the premesis. This film cannot be called cliched, that's for sure. Interestingly, Cronenberg's open casting call (and subsequent hiring of non-professional actors) really compliments this film - they act like the tenants of any apartment building. Scary? It depends on what you find scary - of course, I'm absolutely terrified of any woman who comes pounding and scratching on my door with over-done make-up and lusting after food! Entertaining? You betcha. Most highly recommended."
4,shivers of unease,"From the start the film assaults you and all your social values, nicely intercutting scenes of horrid violence with scenes of domestic tranquility, underlying from the start the nature of the tower block deathtrap, its all about facades, the facades of human morality over our true animal nature. All played out in chilling metaphor of modern existence."
3,Double Helix In The Sky Tonight,"This CD is a perfect example of what's wrong with the recording industry. Follow this recipe: Find a young, pretty, talented artist and by the time the CD is released all emotion, artistic merit and depth has been erased by bland music and forgettable lyrics.Now, if you like soft hooks and generic lyrics, this CD could be just for you - Natalie Imbruglia on downers, or a lobotomized version of Alanis Morissette. Tori Amos and Alicia Keys have absolutely nothing to worry about from Aja, no competition there.However, there are possble hits on this CD, potentially big ones if marketed properly. Isn't that what it's all about, anymore?I would only give this CD 2 stars, but I am soft-hearted, and after all, she is named after a Steely Dan album."
4,"Primaforce ZMA - Good product, bad taste","I gave this product 4/5 stars solely because of the taste. I guess it is the ""vegetarian"" capsules, but these pills leave a bad taste going down. Otherwise, if used properly, this ZMA delivers its claims. I have slept better, and recovered faster from workouts while using this supplement. For the price, the taste drawback is worth it in my opinion. If you need a budget ZMA I would recommend this product."
2,Didn't notice any effect,"Every body is different--mine just didn't see any effect (positive or negative). Not terribly expensive, so give it a try if you're curious I guess."
3,ZMA,"I started taking this product about three weeks ago. It's too early to tell the exact results but I can say, I'm sleeping more at nights. I used to sleep about three to four hours at nights before waking up. I now sleep soundly for about six to seven hours and loss about four pounds so far. I will do a follow up when the the bottle is finished."
4,Cheap Generic - Does Not Include Proprietary Blend of Name Brands,"Yes, it has the zinc/magnesium. However, it does not include the proprietary blend the Now Sports (orange bottle) brand has. This is a good product, but it does not knock me out as quickly, nor make me feel as deeply rested in the AM. I think I will be switching back to the name brand. There's something special in the proprietary additive in the Now Sports brand."
1,Right part for the wrong car.,used the seller's site to pick up the mirror. The mirror came in a timely fashion however it did not fit. I contact the seller and asked him how do we remedy the situation; to date the seller has not been back with a proper resolution. A proper resolution would be replacing the wrong mirror with the right mirror.I am still waiting for the seller to reply.
2,Glock 26 Gen 4 ..........,I have had Fobus holsters in the past for other handguns and found them to be quite excellent. However this product with the Glock 26 gen 4 has some major issues. I must say its retention is unbelievably to tight unless you use two hands. I even did the hair dryer trick an managed to get it to draw somewhat but then it rattles in the slide area of the pistol(quite noisy) an still the retention is far to unreliable for a quick drawing situation. Only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it Fobus an still usable on the range with a two handed draw.
4,Hot,"Wow, Frankie and Reese make for exciting reading. Written in a way that you can believe the mafia side to the story and Reese's conflict between his college's believeing Frankie is the killer and his gut instint that tell's him he knows she did'nt do it. I would of liked a bit more detail at the end on how it worked out for them but was happy with the story and looking forward to reading more of Karin Tabke."
5,I'm about to order the CD . . .,". . . but I was there the second of 2 nights at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, sitting behind the likes of Andy Griggs, Johnny Hartford, Colin Raye and Leroy Parnell. If you have any spot in your life that has ever been touched by the music of Waylon, this is a must have CD. He's every bit the common man's singer/songwriter as he ever was. Seeing him and Jessie after the show was an added treat. Even though his back was giving him major problems and he had to be helped down the back stairs of the Ryman, he still took the time to speak to those of us who waited by his limo to wish him well. Someone asked him why he didn't run for president and he said things were screwed up enough in Washington without his help. Great show, Great guests, Great Living Legend!!"
3,Waylon Comes Full Circle,"I don't take criticizing Waylon lightly. I own just about EVERY item he has recorded, literally. This CD is worth buying for the simple fact that it is his last and for that we are all very sad but if you are a hardcore Waylon fan, this is not the CD for you. If not for his incredible talent, this CD would be horible. Waylon comes full circle. After leaving Nashville and inventing his own sound, here at the end, he returns with a horn section? Travis Tritt? Recording Dobie Gray's Drift Away? Let's say its a long way from Waylon Live and The Restless Kid Live at JD's. The raw Austin sound is gone and the slick country of today invades. If you listen to his music and miss him daily like I do, this CD will not do the trick."
5,Love this movie!,"The Polar Express rates as one of favorite movies! I lost the first disc I had, so was glad to replace it through amazon.com!"
5,polar express movie,As soon as my gra ndson opened this package he jumped up and put it right in the player and he and his toddler brother both sat down and watched it. They love.....it.
5,Great Movie,Quick delivery of Holiday Movie. Great condition. I would definatly purchase from this seller again. Thanks..
4,Believe!,"Great computer graphics in this movie and great message in the power of believing in the true power of Christmas. This is a great family, holiday movie and a classic in years to come. The storyline is timeless and the movie is all around fun to watch. This movie has a lot of fun scenes and action in it that will keep kids watching it."
5,Great movie,This is a great movie! Very fun for a night in with the family. Now we want to see the 3d
1,This red/blue 3D is AWEFUL!,"This is a review of this 3D version. My children were so excited. We sat down for Christmas Eve veiwing of the 3D version and we all immediately felt dizzy, sick, blinded! ALL of us felt this way. It was impossible to watch this movie through the 3D glasses provided. Fortunately it came with the regular 2D movie, so we immediately popped out the 3D version and watched the 2D. 3D version and glasses went straight in the trash. DO NO BUY."
1,THIS IS NOT REAL 3D,IT IS NOT REAL 3D. THOSE CRAPPY GLASSES DONT WORK AND IT IS NOT FORMATTED TO PLAY ON 3D TV'S. WHICH HAVE.. I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED.
1,Unable to hear it,The audio was low. I purchased it to watch with my first grade class and we were unable to watch it because they could not hear it
1,"Film is great, but wouldn't stream in HD","Love Amazon and the digital products. But this HD streaming movie wouldn't stream in HD for the life of me, my high-speed Internet or my Xbox-360. I even reset everything, and speed-tested (20MB+ to the device) but only get a grainy SD version of this otherwise great holiday film. I wound up abandoning watching it on Amazon Instant and using another vendor."
5,One of our favorite Christmas movies,My children (2 & 3 year old girls) loved having this movies this past Christmas to watch. I look forward to watching it again in future years.
5,Great Movie,"Great movie for everyone. Small children may need the puppet scene fast forwarded and some may be sensitive to the lost ticket scene. Other than that, EXCELLENT movie and one we probably watched 200 times over Christmas. No foul language. Just a cute movie."
3,"Good quality DVD, not the best story","The quality of the product was great, and I thought the movie was well done. But honestly, I think the story is a bit empty, kinda making Christmas all about believing in Santa... that's not really the true meaning of Christmas in my mind, but more of a fun element to it. Anyway, I love the whole train idea, but I just thought the true meaning of the story was lacking, not something I'd want to teach my kids to be the true meaning of Christmas, and the movie was actually a bit boring/slow moving in my mind... especially for kids. Basically, I don't think I'll be watching this every year :)"
1,Hated By KIDS but loved by adults,"This movie is so bad. Its terrible, not funny and the animation is creepy. For some reason adults love it but kids hate it? Usually its the other way around with these type of movies but this one NO!!! ITS BAD! Its not funny! i didnt laugh once, When i saw it the first time it was OKAY but the other times was just dumb."
1,3D Polar Express DVD review,"DO NOT BUY THE 3D VERSION OF THIS FILM.Yes, I like the movie, but the 3D version is awful!! The 3D version should not be available for purchase.It is the worst thing I have seen. The 3D imaging is blurry and there is very little of it.Stick with the regular DVD version.Please, please don't waste your money!"
4,Polar Express Blu-Ray,"The product: Product description accurate; received in excellent shape in time specified.The movie: 4 out of 5 stars when compared to holiday movies such as Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th; on par with Elf. Enjoyable Christmas movie to watch with pre-school/Kindergarten-age kids. Lots of music, interesting animation, and a good lesson to boot. Also consider the book so you can read the book since you're not going to watch the movie repeatedly."
2,2d is fine but 3d is horrible,"This blu ray looks amazing in 2d. The problem is with the 3d version. Terrible ghosting throughout the whole movie. It makes it challenging to sit through more than 15 minutes. If you are buying this for the 3d, DON'T! The regular version is cheaper and has better special features. The 3d is a waste of money and aspirin."
3,"Nice, But Not As Good As It Could Have Been By Far","I was full of anticipation for this film, but was disappointed to a certain degree. Though it does have many good qualities and I enjoyed some of it, I felt the filmmakers took out much of the warmth of the story and focused too much on the cool high-action effects they could incorporate. It distracted from the magic this story could have woven, and I can imagine much of it actually being scary to kids--who I thought were the intended audience.Also, again...with what looked like the intent to appear ""cool"", rather then genuine, Christmas town looked cold & industrial, rather then enchanting. I don't think these people get what childhood is about...It felt like creating something wonderful for kids was not their focus, but rather all of their their special new software and equipment they got to tryout."
1,Terrible,This movie was absolutely terrible. The 3d did not work with any glasses. Keep seeing a double picture. I would Not get this movie from this seller.
2,This is not actual 3d Movie,"Hi,This is not looks like 3D Movie, Its looks like normal DVD.I have 3d LED tv,I am not feeling the effect while watching the Movie.Thanks,Shiva"
1,A disappointment to say the least,"This movie was written for young children with very little to stimulate adults. Most good Christmas movies connect with all age groups. This movie was boring, predictable, and really did not say anything healthy or meaningful to children as far as I am concerned. I agree with the reviewer who is concerned about this movie's theme of ""believing without doubt or questioning."" That message is a very dangerous one considering the world we live in.My wife and I were looking at our watches a great deal, even though we like Christmas movies. I guess it might have been visually exciting if I could have seen it in 3-D."
5,Timeless Classic,"We already purchased the DVD when it was first released. Now that I have an HD DVD, I was surprised to learn that The Polar Express was also available in that format. Therefore this was the very first HD DVD that I ever bought. I'll comment on both the HD version and the regular version.I played the DVD over last Thanksgiving when my parents came to visit. I grew up in the 50's and 60's. My dad said that it really put you into the Christmas spirit. This movie will go down as a Christmas classic. How many times have my family watched this since it was first released? Don't ask. I lost count."
4,"Seems so simple, doesn't it?","Either you get on the train or you don't... And as long as you continue to get on the train, you'll grasp the meaning of Christmas. The TRUE meaning of Christmas. But you have to be willing to get on.This movie was a great adaptation of the classic story. I must admit I was a tad bit wigged out by the animation. It was just oogey in some ways. Realistic at times and, at other times, so unbelievably fake...I couldn't decide if I liked the animation or not. Still can't. But the story itself is worth the struggle I had with the animation.Get on board! You'll be glad you did."
1,Quality control,"Can't believe somebody who wants return custmers would sell junk like this. I rated be cause I had too, but it should of recieved a minus.3D Glasses for 3D DVD (3 Pair, Plastic) Extra upgrade Anaglyph"
1,Never received it.,"Since I ordered The Polar Express I have never received it.Money down the drain. I ordered it on Oct 21, 2008."
2,SOUNDS FUN....UNTIL YOU YARN TO TEARS IN THE EXPRESS TRAIN,"WOW, I went to the movies with my husband & My Baby girl. We watched the 3D Version in the city. Picture was beautiful, but the plot to this movie needs major work because it was really boring. My daugther was the only one half delighted, but has not mention the movie to me again. I definity won't be making this part of my collection, although I Love Tom Hanks. Well I might consider buying it for a dollar, No more then five, just for the picture. Full price is not worth it."
1,BUYER BEWARE - Not a 3D Movie,Only good thing is that it has 3D disc and 2D disc. Even after using the included glasses we could not see it in 3D. All one would see is picture with dual lines. Do NOT buy if you're buying this for 3D.
2,"Oh, the drama","This movie makes a big deal out of everything, from drinking hot chocolate to losing a train ticket.Everything is so over dramatized. I guess they did this to make the film longer (out of a lack of available content to put in the movie) but there is no need to fill up a nearly 30 minute segment of the film over a stupid lost ticket. Another downside to the movie are the characters- they are pretty creepy looking for a Christmas children movie, especially the main character and that constant, annoying grin he keeps on his face.I remember reading the book every year in elementary school- they would turn a section of the library into a train and we would read the book aloud- a great, imaginative story but a stupid, unimaginative movie."
1,Cross-eyed Characters = 1 Star,"The fact that every character was cross-eyed totally ruined this movie for me. I can't comment on any other aspect of the film because I was constantly distracted by those eyes. At first I thought it was my imagination, but after looking closely (and constantly), I confirmed that one pupil was not aligned like the other. I can't believe that someone like Robert Zemeckis could allow such inferior animation to be released."
1,The Polar Express-3D (Red/Blue),"I was unaware that this item was old 3D technology and came with 4 sets of red and blue 3D glasses. I could not really play the movie on my HD TV because the HD technology doesn't mesh well with the red and blue glasses and colors on the screen. The movie only cost $9 and did include a DVD (2D Version) of the movie, so it wasn't a total wash. I'll figure something out to do with it or give it to Goodwill. Thanks. David V."
1,Red and Green,"I assumed when it said blue ray 3d that I was getting cutting edge technology of 3d, not old school red and green. Save your money or be satisfied with 2d because the 3d version on this disc is as bad as it gets. People should be made aware of this c**p before they buy it. As far as I'm concerned this is just and out right con job. I feel completely cheated in every way."
1,Polar Express 3D,The film is 1950's 3D vintage. I thought that it was a real 3D movie to view on my 3D Samsung Television. Made me nautious in trying to watch the amatuer 3D. I threw the DVD away and found a real 3D version in Best Buy. I feel that this product was misrepresented and I regret buying it from you.
3,Polar Express,"I have already reviewed this. The product arrived in good condition and in a timely manner, however, it was an old 3D movie with paper glasses and red and blue. We have a new 3D TV and this one was awful. I gave it to my grandsons."
3,IS TO SCARY TO CHILDERN !!..,"I took my niece she's five years old to see this movie because looks real good in trailer, I told her ok lets go see it, because she wants to see it real bad...but when I was watching the movie with her, she's jumped few parts of this movie some scenes was scary for children and have spooky looking animations these children have in this movie also. They story a bit thin..Real didn't liked it, so my five years old niece and is very strange this is rated ""G""That's hard to believe too with some scary parts. Scary for children, Anyway was ok.. Nothing special about it. I guess just a pretty good rental that's all about it. Anyway if u never seen it ..Rent something else a lots better animations movies and great Christmas movies out there beside this lame movie. B"
2,Creepy Animation,"Ick - I thought this movie was dark and creepy. The computer animation was odd and the elves looked like they came right off the set of Deliverance. I couldn't wait for this movie to end and would have walked out in the middle of it, except my 5 year old wanted to stay and see how it ended. She didn't ask to see it again, though, and now her school is having a Polar Express party for the 1st Graders - and they're going to have to watch this movie again. Ugh!"
1,Horrible,"this happens to be my least favorite movie ever. it stinks out loud. i hate the dancing waiters, i hate the amination, and i hate the babyish plot. there was no violence. see ocean's 12 in stead."
5,Polar Express Blu-Ray Superb,Outstanding transfer to Blu-Ray. All the details and nuances of the production are revealed. We own the HD-DVD verion and were very surprised to see more detail in the Blu-Ray version
5,The Polar Express (Blu-ray),This movie was great on dvd but the Blu-ray is even better and looks awesome. Our boys can't get enough of it even 3 weeks after Christmas.
4,Classic animated holiday tale with some bite,"First half of the movie is spectacular, with the perceived danger of the rushing train in the winter wonderland. The objective of the story is a bit vague, it appears to be one of making the non-believer ""believe"". It's pretty hard not to believe, if you see what these kids saw, so nothing surprising there. So, yes, a lack of story telling tension, cliched, if you analyze it too much. However, it IS a holiday movie, and the animation is exciting. The dystopian industrial strength North Pole is unappealing, and a weak counterpart to the part of the movie where our heroes travel to the North Pole. All in all, a lot of fun, with a weak ending. The ride is so exciting, I don't think anyone will complain!"
4,Good 3D movie,This is a good family movie. The 3D effect is good and makes this movie worth adding to any collection.
4,lovely,"I enjoyed the book a few years back and looked forward to this film. A lot of the fine, mysterious magic feeling did transfer to the screen in this movie about a young boy, a train to the north pole, and the spirit of Christmas. I did find it a bit creepy in places and am not sure of its appropriateness for the very young. I was very impressed by the technology used to transform the living actors into picture book characters. I recommend this film to anyone who loves Christmas and loves childrens books."
2,"Great special effects, lame story","I saw this at IMAX 3-D which made the special effects truly excellent. The animation is amazing in its detail and worth seeing on the big screen for that. That said, the story line is pretty thin, the ""moral"" of the story way too plainly and insultingly stated, and Santa's downright creepy looking (no jolly old elf here..he looks like a serial killer). Also don't like the way they treat the reindeer, dragging them around and whipping them. Not an immortal Christmas show, but maybe worth seeing once just for fun."
4,trains,"My son loves trains and this movie we all enjoyed. I love Tom Hanks in any movie, he has watched this movie a few timesin the two weeks we've had it.."
4,"Classic movie, enjoyed by parents and young children","I have seen Polar Express many times...however, this was the first showing at my house for our 2.5 yo and 5 yo. They were enthralled by the story and loved watching it. From a parents perspective, this is a great Christmas movie full of magical wonders."
2,3D version Ghost images will Disappoint,"I was really looking forward to the 3D version of Polar Express, but am very disappointed with the quality of the 3D. This version has very little of the color of the original HD or Blu-Ray versions, and the double or ghost images of the 3D effect are very noticeable and distracting. The 3D effect is quite nice in some scenes but the quality of the 3D images themselves is very inferior to theatrical 3D releases.In short, I'll keep this one for the novelty of some of the 3D scenes, but I wouldn't recommend it over the regular HD or Blu-Ray version."
5,Great movie,This is a great movie. It came packaged as it should. I can't wait to sit down with the kids and drink hot cocoa while we watch it.
5,CAPTIVATING,"My husband and I must have been the only people in the world who had not seen this enchanting movie. After we recently viewed it from Netflix, I decided to buy a copy of it for my mother, who loves both trains and Christmas. I can't wait to give it to her for her birthday in early December. She will love it."
5,Heart warming.,"Loved this movie when it first came out. Loved watching it over again at Christmas and even other times. Even more amazed now I can view it in 3D. This is a keeper, to be enjoyed annually, especially in the company of friends and family. The 2D version is great; the 3D version is even better."
1,Newer 3-D TV's,"I bought this thinking that it would work on my new 3-D TV after reading some reviews, however it doesn't. It does come with 4 pairs of 3-D glasses but they are ancient technology and by today's standards they stink. It did also come with a regular DVD which was good."
3,Polar Express0-D,"I was disappointed in the 3-D effects in this movie. Even with the glasses there was hardly any difference. The story is great, but the 3-D effects aren't."
5,stunning,Wonderful for young and old... beautiful animation and a great story. We watch this movie every Christmas. you won't be dissappointed.
5,Its like a hot chocolate on a cold night!,"Recomnended for all who have tried to ring their bell but can't hear it! One of my favorite holiday movies; Its a Wonderful Life, A White Christmas and Polar Express. Enjoy the memories, Happy Holidays"
5,Wonderful story for the whole Family,This story will touch children and adults with the magic of Christmas! My 3 yr old enjoys the Train and all the excitment.
5,Loved it!,"I got this DVD for half the price of every where else I looked. The movie is a beautiful movie and definitely a keeper! This is a great value, as I only wanted the movie itself and not all the extras."
4,Warning if you live in a cold weather state,"My review is not of the movie or the item itself. It is a warning for those considering ordering this item if you live in a cold weather state. I ordered this as a Christmas present for my nephew. It was delivered on time. I was home at the time of delivery around 6:00pm Chicago time (where it has been averaging 10 degrees for the last week). When I opened the box, I noticed that the Items I purchased were wet. The liquid was coming from the Polar Express Gift Set. The liquid in the snow globe was frozen, which caused the plastic globe to expand forcing it to separate from its base. I'm guessing my package sat in the UPS truck all day before it was delivered to my house. I can't exchange it because it will only happen again.Merry Christmas"
3,Not a bad Christmas movie.,"There were things that I liked about the movie-the characters look so real and the message delivered is a good one, but this movie wasn't able to hold my interest completely. I would suggest a rental."
1,Worst Animated Movie Ever!!!!! For Very Very Little Kids,"Im 15 and loved Madagascar, Shrek, Shark Tale, Robots and Ice Age. I understand this is a holiday movie and it has to be a little different than the other animated movies but it sucks!!!!The animation is terrible. The characters look scary, that kid in the glasses that wears a yellow shirt is very annoying, santa looks creepy and somebody please tell me why a hobo is sleeping ontop of a train. This is crap!! I saw it twice, to give it a second chance but i still hated it. They tryed way to hard but failed"
2,Freaky movie,**1/2I can imagine the thousands of hours of caring work it took to render this animation in such detail. Wish the creators had spent a few hundred hours with better plot and character development--not much spirit and warm-heartedness here.
3,"Excellent movie, but 3D effect needs to be improved upon.","If you have never seen Polar Express in 3-D at an IMAX screen, you will probably enjoy the blu-ray 3-D version. But if you have seen the IMAX 3-D version, then you will be disappointed in the blu-ray version as the technology for the 3-D effect is not nearly as well developed. At times, you just see 2 separate pictures through each eye that do not blend together for a 3-D effect. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a terrible 3-D version. It just does not come close to the IMAX 3-D version."
3,save your money and buy the book,i read the book as a kid in the 80s i loved it but many year later i saw the move a thought it was crap so save your money and buy the book
5,My kids love this!,Great movie for the whole family. Our Elf gave the kids this one morning. Great surprise. We have now seen the movie at least a dozen times. Music is good as well.
3,used dvd review,The dvd stopped a few times the very first time I played it. I'm disappointed in my purchase and will not do this again.
2,CONFUSED! MINE IS NOT TRUE 3D,"I am truly confused. Reading the reviews it sounds as tho many rec'd a disc that is true 3-d. Mine has a 2-d disc and a 3-d disc that uses some cheasy kid cardboard glasses. I have a true HD 3-d I just purchased a few months ago and was really looking forward to watching this in true 3-d. I notice the casing does not say blu-ray. Can anyone expand on my understanding (after the fact) that unless you get blue-ray 3-d you are not getting the true 3d dvd to be watched on the new tvs? And why did some buyers get what seems to be the real deal as advertised and others such as myself get the ""low budget"" version?"
2,No heart or soul,"For its time, a modest technical achievement with some fine sequences (the lost ticket, to be specific) but overall the computer generated characters are lifeless, and more than a bit creepy. It misses the mark by a fair bit, and this animated movie highlights why the Pixar animated movies are so successful. Pixar starts with the story and characters and gives them depth and substance, which extends to the animation. This film takes the opposite approach to its own detriment."
3,Polar 3D,"I was not so impressed with the 3D version of this movie. It was not easy to watch on TV. I was glad there was a non 3D version enclosed. My grandson who loves trains and went to see the Polar Express Train when it came to Midway, Utah, loves the movie and we have watched it many, many times. He won't wear the glasses, so I have another reason for appreciating the non 3D disc."
2,polar express in 3D,The 3D option does not work well on the flat screen tv. It is much more effective in a movie theatre.
2,Not very good,I really didn't like this movie. I wish I didn't buy it because I doubt if I will ever watch it again. The movie seemed long and boring. Almost an hour on the train seemed like forever. There are better films out there.
2,The movie was good but...,"We bought this package because of the globe and train. When I opened the box, the globe's plug was out of the bottom and it had leaked. Now, I'm stuck either waiting for the manufacturer to replace it or for Amazon, but either way I have a very disappointed little boy here. :("
4,No bell?? Somebody PLEASE call Warner Home Video!!!,"This movie is simply AWESOME in every way. Ever since I saw it I've been eagerly awaiting its DVD release, and I was PRAYING for a gift set. Now that it's finally coming, I'm very dissapointed that the gift set will not include a bell -red ribbon and all- like the one The Boy gets at the end of the movie. Big bummer there, Warner.I'm scratching a star for that alone.R.V."
2,My Mommy says this MOVIE IS TOO SCARY FOR ME,Im 6 years old and my mommy doesnt want me to see this movie any more. She said the characters are scary and one of them is thrown into trian tracks. A little boy gets eaten by a wolf too.
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"Ok, the visuals were stunning, but other than that, this movie didn't fall, it plummeted! The characters were awful: A goody-two-shoes girl, a boy who is determined not to have fun, and a dumb boy who doesn't believe in Santa even if he is surrounded by elves. The movie is boring. The only exciting bits are motion simulators, and the bits that try to be funny just aren't. With all the computer animation these days, you'd think that they'd make a GOOD story to go along with the visuals.It's all just chit chat about nothing, and two songs that are just flat out weird. I do not recommend this to anyone who hasn't read the book, because you won't want to read it after this movie.The time of the movie is entirely taken up by a really boring and depressing train ride. It seemse like the creators wanted the movie to be long enough, so the filled it in with junky parts.Santa was scowly, and seemed mean. The movie was flat out awful."
1,2nd hand for new price!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"ordered New Polar Express 3D Blu-ray, but received a second hand one. Had 2 e-mail chats with M.J. Entertainment. Best they could comeup with was to return it for a replacement. Now I see they want me to put more money out of my pocket, for their mis doings. I decidedthat's not happening. Just keep what I have with out further exspense to my self. But, would not buy from them again! Or reconmend themto anyone."
1,This is a Horror Movie for 5 YEAR OLDS!!!!!!,This movie is very scary. The characters have very strange eyes and their heads are shaped weird. Characters are thrown off a moving train chased by wolves. That was very scary for my son to see. He had nightmares about his movie. Its a very dark story and i threw away the DVD because he was crying. This movie is okay for children over 5 but under 5 THIS IS LIKE THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
1,Polar Express 3D Blu Ray,I have to start by saying I love this movie and watch it each year at Christmas time. However the 3D effect is terrible. We started watching the 3D version with great excitement but after 15 minutes we were forced to switch back to 2D so we could still enjoy this movie. Save your money and stick with the 2D version.
5,Believing in the Christmas Spirit,"This is the movie to see this year for children, parents and grandparents like us. We took our 3yr. old granddaughter to see this and she loved it, as we did !! She has talked about nothing else for the past 4 wks and thinks each time we get in the car, we are going to see The Polar Express!! I bought the gift set, book, tape,cd and BELL at Walmart for her for Christmas. Wrapped the bell in a red box just like the movie and you should have seen her eyes on Christmas Eve. That was worth it, right there !!! Can't wait until the dvd comes out... I guess I will have to get 2--- one for my house and one for hers !!"
5,Timeless Christmas Story,"There is just something about the story and graphics that make this a Christmas classic.Adults and children can watch this story together and not get tired of it.My five year old grandson has watched the dvd over thirty five times, and still loves it.We gave him the the dvd last year and just bought another for our house for when he visits."
4,Christmas,"I just love the build up of this movie. The animation is just great and then when we got to the north pole, a little let down."
4,Rockin',"This was a very fun movie to watch. It is worth it just for the scene at the end with Stephen Tyler singing ""Rockin' on Top of the World"" on a unicycle (because he is an elf and can't reach the mike on the stand). Great fun and excellent animation."
5,Do you have your ticket?,"This movie was excellent in the theater. The scene where the train goes over the mountain and makes you feel like you are in the movie was great! This is a great family movie in light of the kind of garbage they are coming out with lately. To those who have seen this movie and did not like it, they must have skipped child hood and gone straight to grumpy old geezer. I highly recomend this movie to anyone."
5,A NEW HOLIDAY CLASSIC!,WONDERFUL! EVERY FRAME OF IT. HAVE SEEN IT TWICE ALREADY. IF THERE IS A BETTER FILM THIS YEAR...I HAVEN'T SEEN IT!
5,Amazing 3D Effects in Polar Express,"I purchased the Polar Express 3D version in 2010 - Knowing that in the future we would be getting a 3D TV in the future. Well, fast forward to December 2012 and we purchased a 55"" LG 3D TV and all I can say it WOW!!! The 3D effects are amazing. I felt like I was transported back into the Movie Theater in 2004. The effects at home were just as good as they were in the Cinema. I've seen other reviews where others have given negative reviews for the 3D effects of the movie. I can't duplicate their experience but I can tell you that I have Sony 3D player, an LG TV with adjustable 3D settings to enhance the ""Wow"" factor, and a 2 + year old 3D disk and it all works perfectly. There is plenty of reviews of the movie itself and I won't bore you with another. Suffice it to say it is a very good movie and has been added to my annual Christmas replay list."
3,Just so-so,"The 3D quality was poor but, I believe you do get the regular DVD version also in this pack so, that was nice."
3,3-D version,THe 3-D effect is not good at close range as in a home television setting. You see double of everything. The Train ride did have some good 3-D effects...
1,Polar Express Fails In 3-D DVD!!!,"Polar Express is a brilliant film, The Blue-Ray Dvd is perfect...but I thought the new 3-D version must be equal if not better...how wrong.After the fantastic 3-D version of Journey To The Centre Of The Earth...the best I have ever seen...You would think Warner Bros would at least equal the process. It is cheap and nasty, plus it will give you a bad head after just 5 minutes. Stick with the Blue -Ray."
3,It's not 3-D and 2-D together,"When I bought this movie,I thought it was gonna give you the choice of 3-D and 2-D,like ""Journey to the center of the earth"",but it didn't.If you want the 3-D version,you have to buy it separately.For me,a minus."
3,The Polar Express 3D,"[[ASIN:B001F12J48 The Polar Express Presented in 3-D]. As with the original movie, the theme was excellent but I was not impressed with the 3D effect. It often distorted color and created too much visual interference which quickly led to eye fatigue. I was glad that the DVD set also included a disk of the original movie. We switched to it and thoroughly enjoyed the magical ride."
3,Great Movie but the 3-D is very poor quality,I just bought this movie to play on my 50 in big screen. The movie itself was great yet we were not able to watch the 3-d version because the quality was extremely poor. I suggest you purchase the regular version if it is cheaper because the 3-d version is simply not watchable.
5,Great Movie,A good family holiday season movie. Wonderful graphics. Really enjoyed it.The story line is very good.Everyone needs to watch it.
5,Wonderful,One of the very best Christmas stories ever!! I recommend it to everyone who loves Christmas and fantasies.Top notch.
5,Magical story,Most amazing story ever. Every child / adult should see this movie. I love all the classics and this one has been added to my collection.
5,Polar Express DVD,I can watch this movie over and over again. The product arrived on time in excellent condition and I plan to enjoy this for years to come.
5,Wonderful movie!,"I expected this movie to be ok, but not great. I was so wrong! My daughter & I have watched this movie over and over, and never get tired of The Polar Express. It has a great story and adventure. I'm not a huge Tom Hanks fan, but he does an amazing job and plays many rolls, some of which I did not recognize his voice until I read the credits. We originally bought the DVD, but there are so many parts in the movie that would be enhanced by blue ray, so I have now ordered the blue ray as well. Hope you enjoy it!"
5,Fantastic,"Ok, lets stop the whinning about the 3D effects. Turn up the brightness of your hd tv.sit back and shut up & enjoy the movie. No it's nothing like the theater version of 3D that I agree, but this is tv folks and by the way, at it's best. If you were honest on your own review than you do know that when you purchased this 3D version it came with a 2d version as well. I never once heard those people mention that in there reviews. Hmm makes me wonder if they ever purchased the Blu ray version..I ejoyed it in 3D as well. It is what it is. A great movie in 3D and in 2DIf your not happy with the 3D, than plop in the disc 2 and watch it in 2D, it's just that simple folks! Watch it and become a kid again!"
3,Mixed bag,"The book is a lovely story with exquisite illustrations.I bought the book and the Tom Hanks DVD for my 3 yr old grandson not knowing the story. It is too old for him but he enjoyed the book anyway because he loves trains. This is his first year having a clue about Santa Claus so he was hooked by the story.The movie, however was way too scarey for him starting with the very loud noise of the train when it came into the yard.I thought it was dark and heavy not the uplifting story I expected. It was not the warm and fuzzy Christmas entertainment I was looking for."
3,disappointed,"After seeing Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3d at the theater I was really looking forward to seeing the Polar Express in 3D, but was truly disappointed in the visual components. It was such ancient technology after the Journey experience."
2,Where is the 3D?,This movie was sold in a package with 4 pairs of 3D glasses - the movie is NOT the 3D version! I got ripped-off! Buyer be aware!
3,For any television not just 3D tvs.,As with the Shrek 3D movie this product is not just for 3D tv's. It can be used with any tv. I bought this for my daughter and son in law thinking it was for their 3D tv. It did state this but I just didn't realize it after seeing the 3D symbol I just assumed was for 3D televisons only. This product takes the red/blue glasses.
3,Eh,"It was an entertaining movie, but I wouldn't see it again. It just wasn't that compelling. My kids liked it but didn't love it."
2,Not for all children! Preview first.,"My husband and I rented the DVD and previewed it before showing it to my 3 year old son who loves trains. I am very glad that we did that because it was way too scary to be shown to him. There are several scenes where the children are walking on top of a snow covered train and almost fall off. Another scene has the train losing control on a lake of ice and then the ice starts to crack. There is also a mystery ghost man who ""lives"" on top of the moving train. I know that all children are different, but I can't imagine letting my son see this movie until he is much older. I suggest that you preview this movie before you give it to the little ones in your life."
2,Uh... why?,"The only reason to see this movie, in my opinion, is if you are a young child. I am eleven years old. Too old to find it entertaining. I have read the excellent Chris Van Allsburg book (be sure to check out his other awesome books too) every Christmas Eve night pretty much. It has this nice smell when I open it. But it should have stayed a book. It went on for about an hour and a half longer than it should have, and most of this irrelevant time frame was spent sliding, screeching, or walking down or up areas at high speed, like on top of the train, sliding down a gift shute, etc., et(yawn)c. For me it took away the whole charm of the book to see an action-packed Polar Express. If you have to add superfluous things to a book-movie, then it should stay a book. I haven't seen Zathura yet, but maybe it will be better than this unneeded venture into animation."
3,No Difference Really,"I bought the Blu Ray edition b/c my 3 year old wore out the standard DVD edition. It got so used I could recite most of the lines in the movie, so I thought the Blu Ray edition might POP on my 1080P set. I really couldn't tell the difference really in video quality. The audio was equal also since I played both on my 7.1 sound system. My advice, stick with the standard DVD and save yourself some cash so you can buy something like Inception that will make your eyes pop and is a pleasure to listen to.I gave it 3 stars because the movie storyline is quite excellent and my boys watch it year round. If the video or audio quality was better, it would have been a 4 star. Very few things in my book get a 5 star rating."
1,Avoid 2004 version like the plague!,"This is a good movie, but if you want 3-D do NOT buy the 2004 version. It has the RED/BLUE glasses. I'm holding out for the newest 3-D version when and if the price comes down."
5,Fast shipping,"I love this movie for the holidays, and was easy to find during a search. It got to us quick. Thank you!"
5,"A must see at Christmas, but then again, I'll never be too old to hear t he ""bell"" !",....a staple of our Christmas entertainment !! The theme and the overall production of this marvelous story are so heart warming. The Polar Express is always a companion of The Christmas Story !!
2,Letterbox version not better than DVD,"I purchased this blu-ray to replace a damaged dvd version. My dvd version had a 1.85:1 ration that fills up the entire screen on my tv. The blu-ray version is like 1.240:1 which gives you about 20 inches on a 60 inch screen. I couldn't see any higher quality with it being in 1080p over the dvd. It was cheap at under $10, which is it's most redeeming quality."
5,The Polar Express,One of my favorite holidays films of all times. Draws me back to my childhood years. I see the film every year in December. You need to add this film to your collection to enjoy for years to come.
4,great holiday movie,"this is a great holiday movie, beautiful animation, color and detail. the 3D feautre is not that great, when you put the 3D glasses on, that are supplied with the dvd, the perception of images is not good at all, you can see red and green glow around the images, even with the curtains closed and lights dimmed in the room. I think it looks more 3D and realistic while watching the 2D version. Over all great movie, but do not bother with the 3D."
5,Polar Express 3D,"The Polar Express Presented in 3-D [Blu-ray]This is a great film and in 3D as I presume it is was originally for is really something else, the sound quality is extremely good. Very enjoyable for the whole family and remember being region free it plays on all blu-ray machines."
3,Red and Blue Glasses included,I really thought I was getting Real3D such as in the movies but was shocked to see it used paper red and blue glasses!The 2D was fine though and the movie was 5 star in story and content. However I was disappointed that the 3D was the old 50'sstyle.
5,Fantastic 3D Movie,"We recently purchased a 3D LED TV, and this was one of the first 3D movies that we purchased and watched. Great picture, awesome color, and great affects!"
3,3D Polar Express,"I love this movie and was kind of disappointed with the 3D glasses. They made it much more difficult to see the movie because they kept moving around on my face. The 3D wasn't that great, either. I'm still glad I bought it, though, and will continue to watch it. Maybe you should offer really good 3D glasses as a separate purchase advertised as the ultimate way to enjoy your 3D purchase."
2,Great Movie Bad 3D Version,"The Polar Express Presented in 3-D is as most say - Not Very Good. I kept thinking something was wrong with the TV or lighting or even maybe the glare but after trying different things I realized that it was just the poor quality in 3-D. It is true the Red images and Blue images do not come together - for the entire movie you see double of everything. The snow effect and other small items will come in 3-D pretty good but all in all, I wish I had never gotten it without reading all the reviews. I have not tried it on a 1080p TV yet but if it is truly better as one reviewer stated, I will make sure and update this review and note that."
3,Christmas on a Rollercoaster... literally!,"The story of 'believing' in Santa just got lost in the repeated 'roller-coaster' action not-so-special effects of this movie. As many reviewers have mentioned, over and over, as will I (LOL) the animation makes the children 'look' like they've risen from the dead. The North Pole workshops look like some sort of dark, severe, lonely factories where one could easily get lost... and that no elf would even want to work in for 364 days a year... but then again the elves might have well been robots, by the way they looked acted.... no personality! I'm sorry but Tom Hanks makes one LOUSY Santa!"
3,2D is better than 3D,"Not sure if it's my equipements, but I bought 2 different 3D movies (Polar Express and Journey to the Center of the Earth), they both look very colorless in the 3D version. First, when you slap on the 3D glasses (and I bought the quality 3D plastic glasses, not the paper glasses given with the movie box), the red eye looks dark, like a blind eye. You can only see out of the blue eye. When we adjust the brightness/contrast, you can see more with the red eye, but the movie appears not as vividly. The 2D version shows much better color. And this 3D version is nothing like the 3D in the theater when we saw this at IMAX. We could see the ""golden ticket"" flying in front of your face. This home-version 3D doesn't do that. It's very barely 3D in our opinion."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was intreged by this 3-D movie, expecially given the low price. However, don't waste your money as the quality is very poor. We are great fans of the Polar Express movie and excited by a 3-D version. But very disappointed with the quality. It is unwatchable."
2,I don't like it.,Poor animation.Annoying characters.My 6 year old even lost interest in it after about 10 minutes.There are so many good Christmas movies out there... Don't waste your time with this one.
1,Polar express,Thought it was a 3d movie and it was but it comes with the red and green glasses. This one is not made for a 3d tv. The movie is great but I ordered the wrong dvd
1,Not what I expected.......,"This movie is distributed for regular television with blue and red paper glasses. I am very disappointed. I thought this was a movie I would play on my 3D player, but was disappointed to find out that it wouldn't. If you are looking for that also, pass this one by."
2,"not a blue ray movie, nor 3-d","well, i bought this movie thinking it was a blue ray 3-d movie, but I was wrong. the 2 stars is because you can stiil see the movie in 2-d and avoid the funny glasses they include and just do nothing for it. I believe people giving 5 stars to this movie are really reviewing a different format. don't buy it if you have a 3-d capable tv. you will be dissapointed....I'm giving this movie to someone doesn't expect to have the 3-d experience"
3,Decent Family Flick!,"Though this is now old news, this is a pretty decent movie for watching with family during the Christmas season."
5,Good for families,Heart warming show good for the young and old in the family. My children loves it and watches it again and again. Good for keeps.
5,good movies for children,M son loves to watch it all the time and specially for grown ups too. it will be watched again next Christmas.
1,Polar Express 3d,Are you kidding me? this reminds me of when i was a kid and 3d first came out.. I have a 2012 3d tv not one that uses red and blue paperback glasses. ripoff.
5,My kids loved it! ...so did I!,It is a great holiday tradition and having it on blu-ray just made the experience even better! Can't wait to watch it again next Christmas!
5,Wonderful Classic!,Every kid and adult should see the movie and read the book. It's great! They are beautiful and real Christmas classic.
1,POLAR EXPRESS 3D,This rating is for the 3-D version that at best is 1/2 3D. Using the red blue glasses also erase most of the color content and the cheap cardboard glasses are uncomfortable. Too bad they couldn't have duplicated the great 3 D that was shown in theatres. Warner Brothers should learn to perfect this system. I have been anxiously awaiting a good 3 D quality movie for years and have wondered why they think a red/blue pair of glasses is going to provide the effects. Also...the 3D effect is so much better with JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF EARTH (this time going red/green glasses why can't they at least give a better 3D effect with this great holiday movie. Very unhappy with this product
2,I wanted to like this,"I recently purchased The Polar Express... again. The plot is cloying, the central theme revolving around cardboard characters. The backgrounds are exquisite. The faces of the characters are likely frightening to younger children and are extremely off-putting, in particular, the character of the main female lead. Plot points are made with a sledge hammer... repeatedly, but as my wife said, for little kids, that might be appropriate. But some of the scenes would probably frighten little kids.I wanted to like this. I like Tom Hanks, I like Christmas and I like Christmas movies. This one though seems geared to getting Christmas presents, characters are introduced and leave. The subplot labored, all in all, unless you are a fan of commercial Christmas, I would suggest giving this a wide berth."
4,blu-ray polor express,This review isnt about the movie itsself.. I absolutely love this movie.. Ibought this blu-ray copy to analyze the video ... The wide screen format is ok i suppose but i prefure full screen.. I have an excellent copy of this in a standard full screen dvd.. There is very little or no differance in the video quality... on this movie the blu-ray just isnt worth it....
1,3D is TERRIBLE!,"Speaking about 3D portion only... I bought the standard 3D version of the movie... not the blue ray version. Within minutes we had to shut it off. The images are distorted. There are terrible shadows around the chraracters and objects. The glasses are made of paper, with red on the left eye, and blue on the right. The colors of the movie are distorted from the glasses. A complete waste of time and money. Tried this movie on two different televsions, and with two different DVD players.Rip off."
5,5 stars for the 3d movie,"Enough has been said about the movie. The 3D on this movie is excellent. I am not a fan of the movie, but watching this in 3D was enjoyable. The reviewer that wrote about the ticket was dead on...that was some of the best 3D work I have seen. I understand why they are asking $26-$34 for this 3D movie. I'll be glad when we can rent 3D movies!"
3,Magical Adventure to Never Never Land,"Throughout the film children are taken into the magical world of make-believe where they are entertained by dancing, singing waiters; ride the roller coaster of their lives; experience the great ice adventure; and finally get to see Santa's hometown-the North Pole.In The Polar Express, many children enter the train but only two step outside themselves to see what's truly important, friendship. While the other children party on the train and eagerly wait for their chance to receive the first Christmas gift of the year, two children reach out to a lonely, poor boy. Throughout the film, you'll watch the compassion for another human evolve into a friendship that helps three children find their inner-strength."
1,DVD didn't work!,"The very first time we played it, it got stuck in several spots and would not continue the movie until we skipped the entire chapter. We missed a quarter of the movie, as a result! We ended up throwing it away and buying a new copy at the store."
1,Not Blu-Ray 3D,I was disappointed to find out this was not Blu-Ray 3D even though it was listed under the Amazon heading of Blue-Ray 3D movies. It has the old fashioned red/green cardboard glasses (4) sets come with the movie. It is not recognized as 3D format in a 3D TV.
2,Do not buy for a 3D tv,"We purchased this video to watch on our Sony Bravia 3D tv. It comes with a ""3D"" DVD and the regular DVD. It also comes with 3 ""3D"" glasses. If you try to watch this video using your personal 3D glasses this picture is distorted and there is a large red shadow around everything. If you use the glasses that came with the movie, it takes away the red effect, but it is not 3D and you can only see out of one side of the glasses. Horrible! We took it out and watched the regular version. The video itself without the 3D is amazing. A fantastic Christmas movie."
4,I'm glad it came in 2 disc,"I ordered this movie because of the 3d. I am glad it came in a 2 disc package. We found the 3d was unwatchable. I don't know if it was the cheap paper glasses We used, but the 1st mate and I after 10 minutes of the movie pulled the disc and put in the 2d disc. The picture was quite blurred and distracting. It was giving us both a head ache in 3d anaglyph. The 2d disc was enjoyable, good story line. After watching it for the first time I can see why it is a classic."
5,great Kids movie...,A great Christmas movie to pull out every year to watch with the family. The animation is wonderful. They almost look real!The story of a boy who has stopped believing and has to have a little help in being reminded of the reason for the Christmas spirit.
2,Great movie! POOR 3-D Version!,"This movie is a hit and will become a classic to future generations. Well done to those that teamed-up to make it. HOWEVER: the 3-D version does not work. We waited for days after purchasing this version to see it on thanksgiving day as a family. What a disappointment! My husband and I got an instant headache just by watching it for a few minutes with the 3-D glasses on. We tried the blue ray dvd player and even real 3-D glasses from the theater... nothing worked. To their credit, a few scenes were OK, (we skipped the movie to the most visually stimulating scenes), but generally speaking is not worth to hurt your family's eyes when the original version is almost 3-D by itself! I very rarely review an item online, but once cd's or dvd's are opened they are not exchangeable (unless is the same item),or allowed for returns. I hope this info is useful."
1,More that a little missing on DVD,"The DVD of the Polar Express I received did not contain the exciting scenes when the train was on the frozed lake, quite a chunk of time. Also the DVD stopped close to the end and would not finish the movie. This was very disappointing as it was a gift for my husband who loved the movie and especially the train on ice portion.The Polar Express (Full Screen Edition)"
1,The Polar Express,"I would like to tell you what I think, but since BOTH dvd's wouldn't play, I can't. I have returned them both and haven't received a new dvd, yet."
2,Children might like it,"I am 50 yrs old, my fiance is 48. We settled in on Christmas night to watch Polar Express. Her first words was that the animation was kind of eery and spooky. I commented that it was like watching a movie with animation that had the same look and feel of photo's from childrens books. Maybe we were too used to the amazing animation from studio's such as Disney's Pixar? We loved CARS, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc etc. The bottom line was that the animation for Polar Express was just too odd to keep us interested and we turned it off after 20 minutes and switched over to watching ""Cars"" from Pixar. Polar Express may very well be a wonderful movie, and kids might enjoy it. But it just didn't do it for us. This was the Blu-Ray version, so perhaps my expectations were too high."
1,What a COMPLETE RIP-OFF!,"The anaglyph 3D used here is absolutely JUNK - worse than anything I have seen, and certainly not of the usually high standards of WB Home Video. This is a MAJOR faux-pas for Warner Home Video, and a complete rip off for consumers. Double images, not depth. I urge Warner Bros. to go back and re-issue this in proper 3D form, similar to the ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"", and let consumers get a replacement disc. What a way to kill the value of this great catalog title!Despite the novelty, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
4,Is there a 3-D version?,"I too saw the movie in 3-D. It surpassed my expectations of an animated movie. The special effects of 3-D added another dimension to animation: you feel the snowflakes falling, and I remember the reflection/image of viewing the character from below ice. Everyone falls in love with the Polar Express train as its engine appears bigger than life.I would also give the 3-D version 5 stars. Is it available?"
1,Totally Awful 3-D effects,"After getting a Sony PS3 for watching Blu Ray movies and getting the 3-D version of ""Journey To The Center Of the Earth"" , I just knew that this one would look awesome in 3-D. Boy was I ever WRONG. This thing is HORRIBLE. Double images and the glasses are terrible.It hurts your eyes to watch it more than about 5 minutes. This movie is not at all like the ""journey....Earth"" Movie. Maybe they will come out with an update or something later that will fix it , but for now ,,,PLEASE don't waste your money on this piece of crap."
5,Blu Ray 3D does this movie justice!,"My 6 year-old son is a HUGE train lover. The Polar Express is one of his favorite movies of all time. We owned a toddler version of the book, we own the actual book, we own the DVD, the 3D version of the DVD, and now the Blu Ray 3D version. Blu Ray 3D blows them all away.The story, about a boy struggling to believe in Santa, is a wonderful journey to the North Pole. Seeing it in real 3D for the first time was like actually BEING on the train! I gasped when the train pulled up to the house, it was that incredible (and this from someone who has seen the film dozens of times!)Since Amazon seems to aggregate all reviews under each version, if you own a 3d capable blu ray player and television, please look for the version that says Single Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo. There is another ""3D"" version of the film that comes with the old school blue and red glasses - this is NOT what you want. Trust."
1,Nicer Glasses Don't Work Any Better,"I just wanted to let everyone know that nicer glasses don't work any better. I purchased a set of nice high quality plastic glasses hoping that this would correct the horrible double image with the cardboard glasses but it did not. The image looks exactly the same so don't waste any more of your money on that idea. It's too bad, this was such a wonderful movie in 3D."
4,Must have,Adding to my collection of xmas movies for my kids..well made...all together my purchase went smooth and received quickly also
5,IT MAKES YOU FELL ALL WARM & FUZZY,"I (47 yr old Mom) took my 6 yr old son and 9 yr old daughter to see this movie on Christmas Eve in the hopes of extending what seems to be my daughter's renewed belief if Santa this year.This movie beautifully reinforces the magic of the season and the importance of loving one another, even though we are all different. Santa speech at the end of the film is appropriate for believers and older children alike.This will undoubtedly be a Christmas Classic as time will tell. It has visual as well as emotional appeal for all ages. It is captivating, intelligent and fun REFRESHINGLY unlike today's dumbed down, rude or violent PG movies aimed at our young children. Parents will find nothing objectional in this film, which is a delight in itself.Go see it with your loved ones, and buy it when it comes out on DVD. I know I will."
3,BEWARE of topics that will raise questions!!!!,"I don't normally write many reviews online but I had to come on and write a quick review about this movie. Today, I took my 7 year old son to see the Polar Express. We were both looking forward to it very much and I personally thought it was a well written movie, but....my son went in fully believing and came out with a lot of doubt and a lot of questions to my dismay. I know that the movie is supposed to make kids with question suddenly believe, but, it did the oposite for us. It opened his eyes to a lot of things that he hadn't really thought about until he saw it being questioned in the movie. My advice to parents is that if you bring your kids to the movie, be prepared for the possibility of the doubt coming out of the film."
1,DISMAL 3D,Whatever happened to this dvd.The 3D is apalling in the close ups with double images all the time.Like those 50's 3D films I used to watch.The background is okay in 3D however. Why wasn't it done properly in the transfer to dvd?
1,3D garbage,"I'm angry I wasted my money on this 3D joke, most of the time there's no 3D or it's blurry or there are lots of double images, this DVD is trash please do not waste your time pure trash, how can the people who put this out not see the quality of this pile of donkey dong, I'm selling mine for $2 dollars or better yet perhaps it will make nice flames in my fireplace.PLEASE AVOID THIS AT ALL COST. Robert Zemeckus shame on you for ripping us off here. AGAIN HOW CAN THE PEOPLE WHO PRODUCED THIS NOT SEE THE MAJOR DOUBLE IMAGES THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE."
1,"I expected it to be bad,but it was WORSE.","How could anyone like this??Okay...let's see how everyone responded...They say it's so touching and made-my-cry-when-I-saw-this,and the reason why is because it's a deliberately sappy tear-jerker.And you know what...I don't like sappy stuff.And the songs...they were worse than ""The Christmas Shoes"".It would have been better if they had just replaced them with pong noises.Even the cheesy free game on Postopia.com entertained me more!"
1,"5 Stars for the Story, 0 Stars for the Production","I liked the theme of the story. I hated the production. Either do true animation in the form of cartoons or claymation or have real actors. I hated the way this movie was put together. I do not want to watch computer generated animation in a film. If I wanted computer generated characters, I would play computer games, thus, this movie was a bust."
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!,"This movie is horrible. First, it was very slow. The train ride to the north pole seemed like it would last the whole movie (I almost fell asleep). Second, the movie was very sad. And last, to me, I felt that the were giving the message ""Seeing is Beliving,"" for the boy never belived in Santa untill he saw him. This movie makes the story look bad. Don't by this movie, and save your money for a better, happier movie."
2,3D Polar Express movie,"When I ordered 3D Polar Express movie, I assume it was a movie for a 3D TV.It was a format to wear paper 3D glasses on a regular TV and very disappointing because it was a gift for my sister.With confusing electronic technology these days, a clear description would be a better way to describe the product."
2,Tough to Watch,"First and foremost, the character animation in this film is just plain weird. Unfortunately, what would have been a really solid Christmas story has been transformed into something eerie and creepy. The child-like images are strange as are all the other characters. Also, using Tom Hanks voice for half a dozen characters in this film is overkill and nauseating. In particular, his high-pitched screechy voice for the train ghost and conductor is like nails on a chalkboard.Some of the music is very good, but the classic renditions like ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" sung by the elves... Again, very strange. If you like eerie, dark animated content to tell a good Christmas story, you'll be drawn to this one. If you're buying this movie for young children, make sure you have the DVD remote in hand to skip ahead from the more bizarre scenes."
1,Don't waste money for 3-D Version,"Just repeating what has already been said here many times....the 3-D version is a HUGE disappointment. Wearing the old blue and red glasses, I felt like the red eye was blind and no matter how I tried to maneuver the glasses the picture was at best mediocre. I would get flashes of the 3-D and get excited, but then it would slip back into blurriness. All I got was an incredible headache for my efforts!"
1,The 3D did not work,The 3D version I received was a very old style format and will not work on newer style projectors. I have aSony system.
5,Same Great Movie--Even Better in 3D!,"Got this as a gift for my nephew, but ended up loving it myself when we watched it over Christmas together. There are some publications that claim children under 3 years old either:a) shouldn't watch 3D Blu-ray movies because it's not good for themb) may not have the depth perception/binocular vision to really appreciation the 3DThe first one doesn't really concern me, because I don't think those concerns have been substantiated, and (for what it's worth) my 2 year old nephew really seemed to think that the 3D was cool--don't know if it was that he actually thought that the movie was cool, or he just enjoyed wearing the 3D glasses :)As for the adults, we all really enjoyed the crystal clear clarity of the movie and the additional depth added by the 3D effects. This movie is wonderful for all ages, and a must-see every year around Christmas."
3,Good Christmas Movie,"The movie was good and I'm sure I'll watch it again next Christmas. Visually, the characters look a little creepy. Don't really like the way it looks, but after I got used to it, I looked past it and enjoyed the story."
2,3D Doesn't Work,"My son liked The Polar Express the first time he watched the movie in school. We bought the 3D version hoping it would be like watching Journey to the Center of the Earth. Unfortunately, it wasn't a bit like it. Despite our many attempts to change the settings on both our player and TV, it still gave us a terrible headache. It was a good thing, the pack included a 2D version or else our AUD20 would have gone to waste... I feel cheated in a way..."
5,Great movie,My children love this movie. Great Christmas story! Follows the book for those who have read it. Very reasonably priced too.
5,Cherished book and fun movie!,"All the fun and mystery of Christmas and belief. The artwork is stunning and, in 5.1 sound, very compelling auditorily."
3,better viewed in 3D,"I saw this movie in 3D at the IMAX theatre in downtown San Francisco. The technical features are spectacular. There are several breathtaking scenes, including snowflakes falling down from the sky, the train sliding right over you on the ice, the roller coaster ride in the North Pole, and three children walking on a very high bridge.There is not much beyond technical brilliance. The movie lacks emotional warmth and magic that usually exist in a Christmas movie, such as Elf or The Santa Clause. The train conductor and the guy on top of the train are sometimes too creepy, maybe that is why some young kids do not like the movie. This movie won't make you a believer of Santa Clause for sure."
2,Not pleased with type of glasses,Did not realize the 3-D would be using the out-dated paper blue/red glasses...Will definitely ask more questions in the future. Disappointed.
5,3D The Polar Express,"I thought this would play on my 3D TV with my 3D blue ray player. The 3 D version (DVD, not blue ray) does not play with a 3 D TV, it is only good on a regular TV. I guess because my LG 3D TV does the conversion in the TV and this movie was made for a regular TV. The price was good, so I will give it away to my Grandson. Shipping was fast and condition of the movies were good, just my mistake. But I do now know you cannot play the old 3D movies made for the paper glasses.Continued: I did send the DVD Polar Express movie to my Grandson. I found this in true 3D, so just remember that you need to see the specifics of the movie before you order. This movie is great in 3D blue Ray version. The effects are as I expected them to be, and I always loved the movie in regular 2D format. I am just spoiled with my new 3D TV. Used the Prime service and arrived as promised. Condition of the movie was perfect."
2,not for 3D t.v.'s,"this video is not for 3Dt.v.'s. it comes with its own cardboard glasses that are not comfortable and do not work very well. the 3D feature is horrible. but if you want the regular 2D version, then this one is good. I have an LG 3D t.v. and can not see this movie in 3D without their own cardboard glasses. i will give this movie away to someone who does not have a 3D t.v."
5,A New Christmas Classic,"I have a widescreen TV so the movie format was perfect. This story will warm your heart and thrill the little ones, young and old. This is the new Christmas Classic."
5,Love this movie!,"We love the fun story line and heart-warming lesson to ""Believe"" in our hearts of the symbols of Christmas. Our 2 1/2 year old so loves the ""Train Movie"" too. We love how the movie animation follows the animation in the book which is another favorite of ours."
3,It was alright,"This movie was just a 3 to me.Lots of gorgeous landscape scenery (snowfall, northern lights) and an exciting rollercoaster ride (aka rollercoaster tycoon), Hanks made an appearance for at least 4 different characters, the computer generated kids were just disappointing (think claymation with each hair strand blowing realisticly through the breeze..) I could not get past them being CG, Pixar and Dreamworks are much better. It's a good attempt though.. Show this movie to the under 10 year old crowd. I'd be pissed if my kids got on a train in the middle of the night.. blah The high note was the ending song by Josh Groban what a beautiful song."
3,It gets you in the christmas mood,I am a huge fan of christmas movies and found this one enjoyable. The film aims moor to the younger age but anyone can also enjoy the film. The film gets you right in the christmas mood and features some good chritmas songs. The best thing about the film is the animation it's great the only bad animation was santa I felt like he looked the least real of all the charactors. The story is slow at the begging and dosent get really good till the middle. But again it's a good christmas movie to get you in a festive mood.
5,Very happy with this!,Bought this for my grandsons for Christmas & they didn't want to stop watching it. Their parents loved it too. 3 years old & up it was a perfect gift.
2,Polar Express,I purchased this movie and it skips in a certain spot every time. I sent Amazon an e-mail about it but I never got a response. I do not know if I will continue to purchase DVD's through Amazon anymore.
2,Disappointed,"I just got a new 3D TV and blue ray player. I thought this would work on my new tv and player, but it didn't...it was all blurry. It is such a great movie, we just had to watch the regular version. I was disappointed that nowhere did the description say that it would not be compatable with a 3D TV or blue ray player. Presented in 3D is misleading. Still enjoyed the movie itself though."
2,Not happy with product,The 3-D glasses were not effective at all. We did not enjoy it as we thought we would. We could not see through the red eye part of the glasses.
3,Dissapointed in format,I did not realize there were differents types of 3D.Be sure to check you TV for which type of 3D is used.I should have read the fine print.
2,Sleeper and poor 3D,"This movie seems to get tons of great reviews but I have not been able to get through it without yawning and wanting to fall asleep. While the story might be sweet for kids, the Tom Hanks characters are tiresome and the 3D effects are lame and not worth paying extra for. Get the 2D version if you must by this slow sappy turd of a film that is like watching a tranquilizer in slow motion."
1,Polar Express 3-D?,"The 3-D movie wasn't the new 3-D HD technology. You had to wear these funky red/blue glasses, not the glasses that came with our 3-D tv. You could not watch it during the day and the quality was poor. We can't even watch it. A total waste."
1,blu-ray blues,"won't play in my blu-ray player, other blu ray disc play, but i can't get that one to play, so you tell me"
1,"I rented the 3d version, but the picture came in normal and not even as good quality as my DVD.","So I went to customer support and they tried to tell me it was my fault. So I just went to another site and selected the 3d copy and it played fine...in 3d! Sorry Amazon, I love your site, but when I do a search for 3d titles, then rent it and it doesn't display in 3d...you should just refund my money and not make a big deal out of it."
4,The Tom Hanks Express,"It's a good movie, good story. My boy likes it...well, he likes the train. My only surprise was to see that Tom Hanks DIDN'T play the part of all the children too."
5,Fantastic 3D,I originally bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I watched this amazing movie on my lcd screen and was totally blown away. You have got to see this. Thank you Amazon for an amazing deal.
5,3Delightful,"The story is adorable, but the best part is the 3D effects and the animation, the snow actually looks like it's falling in the living-room. I was like a child watching this movie in 3D. I can't wait to have the kids and grandkids come watch it too."
5,Polar Express,Engrossing for kids for all ages. I'm not sure if it's my laptop but it would be nicer to be able to turn up the volume more.
5,Polar Express DVD,"My mother (age 60) kept mentioning whether my boys (age 7 & 9) and I have ever watched this movie, so I ordered this for her and us to watch together...We have watched it 2 times soo far, it's great!"
3,MY GRADE: C plus.,This CGI animated tale of a boy and others traveling up to see Santa Claus at the North Pole was hit or miss in story plotting though my little nephews and nieces enjoyed it well enough and I suppose that's good since they were the intended audience.I enjoyed the hot chocolate dance scene the most with runner up being the kids on the big tree at the North Pole.Notable voices by Tom Hanks and 80s Eddie Deezen. I'd know the latter voice almost anywhere.Based on a novel of a similar title by Chris Van Allsburg.SOUND/MUSIC: B to B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY/CGI: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus (higher for kids); WHEN WATCHED: end of December 2012 (streamed).
2,3-d version not worth the money,Save your money and buy the 2d version of the polar express. The 3-d version is blurry and doesn't compare to the imax 3-d version.
4,Really Need a Big Screen TV,"Thought the movie was great in 3D and you can see it on a regular TV but, if you have a big screen TV, it would be so much better. It works on regular, don't get me wrong, but my son sits pretty close to the TV to really get the effect.Thom"
4,"Enjoyable movie, solid 3D experience.","The movie is great to begin with, adding 3D just enhances the experience. The 3D version does a nice job of providing depth as well as some occasional images that pop off screen. For those that want the screen to jump out at you, you will be disappointed, but in my opinion, 3D quality is both about the depth and screen pop combined. Too much of either and not enough of one can leave the viewer dissatisfied. While it does not have a great deal of pop, it does have enough and excels at screen depth.I would rate this an 8.8/10 overall. It will become a family tradition around Christmas time each year."
2,Broken DVD Case- DVD is loose inside case!!!,"The movie itself is wonderful, so please don't let my review stop you from buying The Polar Express movie. However, the inside of this DVD case was cracked. As a result, the actual DVD flops around inside the case. There is no way the inside got cracked without a mark on the outside of the case. Someone picked up this DVD, realized the DVD was loose on the inside, and they simply didn't care. I left a negative review with Amazon the day after we received the DVD, and I requested a new case or an exchange. They NEVER got back to me. The DVD will definitely be scratched and in a few months."
1,"Okay Movie, Cr@ppy 3-D","Regardless of what you think of this movie, the 3-D presentation sucks. It didn't work for cr@p on my 27 inch TV. Maybe on a bigger TV it would work better, but I doubt it. If you you loved this movie in 3-D just stick with the regular version and bombard your local I-MAX with requests to bring it back this Christmas."
3,A Word on Believers -- The Theme of the Movie,"I must confess that I found this movie somewhat amusing. Although there is not, on the surface of the movie, a plot, there are incredible graphics throughout the movie. (It is true, as many will be wont to point out, that there are far better graphics in many other movies, both animinated and not, but that is besides the point). The central theme of the movie, which is aimed towards children, is that if you have ""faith"" in something, you can hear and see things with which non-believers will not notice. This is largely true: notice the crying spells in our nation's (the United States') churches: certainly non-believers could not relate or understand the crying spells. The believers do -- and that is what differentiates the two. The believers believe, and thus, see, things that others do not have. I say this as an agnostic non-believer: but I do not doubt that the believers actually feel something and see something that others do not see."
1,They blew it!!,What could have been an exceptional move became mediocre!The adult characters in the movie are either grotesque or loud & in the kids face or both.Instead of being kindly of face the elfs are old & mean looking.Several scenes appear to be there purely to induce an adrenaline flow.aSoaringHawk
1,"As the critics say: ""Hellride to Creepyville""",This movie deserves 0 stars but since you can't select 0 stars i guess i will just do 1. This movie is the weirdest creepiest movie in the world! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! DO NOT RENT THIS ITEM! DON'T EVEN WATCH THIS ITEM! But you should read the book!
4,great for train lovers,"My 4 yr old son loved recreating the train scene where it skids across the ice. He asked us to make an icy river that can connect to his wood Thomas the train set, so his train could slide around on it. We took a piece of plywood and cut semi circles out of the edges of it, so it could lock into his track pieces. Never even needed to spray paint it blue... he loved it and thought it was just like the movie. There are parts of the movie that are a bit scary (the marionettes in one of the rail cars and the man on the top of the train with the coffee mug) that we could do without, but overall, it's a great movie."
5,a great movie,this was a great movie every body in my house loved it.I give it five stars it was amazing how one actor acan be so many people.so once again it was a supper duper calwatappuer movie or athor ways as sweet
3,not worth the money but good,I wouldt pay to watch it again but it is a cute movie and kinda creepy at the same time lol.
3,Nice for the holidays,"I just bought this on Blu-ray and watched it with my 3-year-old son. He liked it, but the action scenes were a little too intense for him at times. The animation isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done. I like the story, even if it is a little cliche."
3,Good Movie not great,"The movie was OK I know it's popular, it had a nice message, but was ruined by the horrible playback of on-demand"
3,not thrilled,"I like the price, my son loves trains, but my husband and I did not enjoy it with him, seemed a little unusual"
2,Polar Express - 3D,"Poor 3D effect - Not satisfied. Bad 3D video. Picture is blurry and not clear to view through 3D anaglyphic glasses, causing eye-strain and headache, and had to terminate viewing."
2,very disappointed,"This is what I imagine a bad bootleg copy would look like. Even wearing the included 3-D glasses, the picture was blurry and all the color disappeared to almost just black and white. We have other 3-D movies that work perfectly. This one was simply awful."
2,The Polar expresss in 3d,"IT is not a very good 3D DVD, I got it because there are good review that was I got it. I'm dispointed."
3,Polar Express DVD,The DVD works just fine. The case was not in the best shape. My son just loves this movie and it was a good price.
2,"Good movie, bad 3D","We love this movie, so we wanted to buy a 3D version for our new tv. This is the old 3D, that requires the red and blue glasses(included). The movie made us dizzy and the effects were terrible. The movie can be watched in 2D mode, which is the reason for 2 stars. Movie is watchable, but certainly not in 3D mode. I bought the newer, blu-ray / 3D combo pack, and it is excellent. In short, this particular dvd is good for 2D, bad for 3D."
3,Great movie - Credit card number stolen???,"The movie was great and the delivery was quick - no concerns there. Somehow our credit card number was stolen and 6 other purchases were made after we bought this movie. We hadn't used this card in several months and this is the only purchase we made with it. Not sure who's fault this was but it did not make us happy! Luckily, the credit card company was able to stop the transactions."
1,NOT a 3-D movie!,"I already owned the movie and wanted the 3D version. Sadly, this is not true 3D. Pass on this one,"
5,great gift,"My nephew went bonkers when they stopped playing this movie on netflix, he still watches it every day since we got it."
4,Great movie for the holidays,Me and my family watch this movie every Christmas. This has been a tradition we do every year. This movie is great for all ages.
3,Cute but not great,"This is a cute movie, but it is lost on an adult. It has great CGI and the chaarcters are so well done, they could pass as real people. The voices are great. Hanks does a good job on all his characters. The story is a little bland for this adult. A good attempt but it lacks something."
5,Wonderful Experience.,My grandchildren (ages 3-14) loved this beautiful book as well as the video. It was a wonderful addition to our POLAR EXPRESS (Texas State Railroad) train ride that we took during the Holidays.
2,The Polar Exspress DVD,The Polar Exspress dvd that I received will not play on my lap top or my son's dvd player.. Very disappointed.
2,Polar Express Blu- Ray,Love this movie to death! But the 3-d transfer IS straight Horrible! I have viewed some very nice 3-D transfers and this is CLEARLY not one of them! U will be dizzy from beginning to end- Ya! One of those kind of transfers'
5,Polar Express; A Movie for All Ages,"Polar Express was a great movie. After reading the book, it was great to see the realistic action on screen. The animation of the characters was very lifelike. The story formation caught my undivided attention throughout the movie. Loved it! A great movie for all ages."
5,Great DVD,"I am ahead of the curve this year. Due to the repeated usage and viewing from the little one, this is yet another replacement for an awesome movie."
5,Brilliant DVD -Veiwing a must !!!!,This DVD is absolutely marvelous!!! A must for young and old not to mention those who like a distraction for the kids while you get on with daily chores!!!
5,The Polar Express,I purchased this movie for my grand-daughter who loves it as much as I do. It is such a magical movie and can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.
4,3d polar express,"Movie is great for the whole family , I recieved it 2-3 weeks from time ordered , which was within the time frame stated."
1,Horrible,"As it's our favorite Christmas movie (we also have it on Blu-ray), we thought it would be fun to see it in 3-D. It is UNWATCHABLE! The colors are beyond awful and the 3-D effects pathetic. We tried through different scenes and finally gave up after a couple of minutes. The glasses which are provided can only comfortably fit people with tiny heads. By the way, we have a brand new Philips LCD 42"" and followed all the guidelines. Do not buy in 3-D. Just enjoy this great movie on regular DVD or better yet, on Blu-ray."
1,Avoid the 3D version,The original movie and DVD were very good. The 3D version is another matter. To say this is poor is an understatement. Do not buy it. Check the blogs first. I wish I had. This movie (3D version) is not watchable. I have tried it on multiple TVs and DVD players. It is full of ghost images and characters with 4 eyes and 4 eyebrows. Save your money - buy the original version.
1,3D is Disappointment,"I had to go to several stores to find the 3D version and was excited to watch it - Polar Express is one of my favorite Christmas movies. We put the glasses on over our eyeglasses and were immediately disappointed. We even tried wearing our eyeglasses on top of the cardboard ones and that didn't really help. The quality was poor, the ghosting lines, blotches and the colors were all washed out. We were really disappointed. Yes, we could see the additional dimension sometimes, but it gave me a headache at first to get adjusted. I'd stick to the Blu-Ray 2D version."
1,Polar Express (3D Edition),"This product did arrive on time. However let me say that I ordered this product not knowing about different regions which affect the playing of a movie in your dvd player. I had always assumed that if it was in english you were good. I looked for that and that was it, so it will not play in my player. I contacted the seller admitting my mistake and asked if they could help me in some way they have yet to contact me. This was about 2 weeks ago. Contacted them through Amazon so I'm pretty sure they got the email. I guess they feel it was my mistake so....."
1,Polor Express 3-D,"It is not worth the money I paid for it, it is 3-D but not as good as most of the 3-D movies Ive bought, it just doesn't have the special effects that 3-D should have or that's my opinion..Thanks............."
1,polar express,"When i try to play it ,the3d glasses include wont work.i dont know how to watch it in 3d.my kids are complaining cos they wanna watch it.what can i do to make it work.."
2,polar express is siderailed,i do not like this 3d. nothing comes out at you. i thought it was the one that took special 3d tv and glasses but came with the cardboard ones. i am disappointed and do not recommend this version.maybe the other one is better but i do not know. to me it was a boring movie.
2,3d POLAR EXPRESS,3d affects were very few and not up to par of the newer three D movies on DVD. Was very disappointed.
4,"Great movie, fast shipping!",We ordered this movie b/c we couldn't find it in stores anywhere-out of season- & my daughter's other DVD hadn't gotten scratched & was not working. The movie was delivered before it indicated!
4,great,"great movie. very geared toward the 3d version, but overall still a good movie that's very original. some parts are just weird (i.e. the ghost on top of the train), but good for kids."
1,"Not the ""new"" 3D","I just upgraded to the new 3D TVs, and wanted to get a movie to test it out. I did a search on Amazon for ""3D"" movies, and this one popped up. Great movie, so why not? Well, turns out it's the old version of 3D, with the red and blue glasses. So, if you're looking for the new technology, this is not the movie you want."
4,The Polar Express,Fabulous Christmas Movie!Had a great time with the whole family.Something I will probably watch on a yearly basis.
4,Great,Easy and enjoyable to watch. I would recommend both for Tweens. Love the service and how convenient it is to rent.
5,"Make sure to see it in IMAX 3-D, not flat 2-D","THE POLAR EXPRESS is the first ever full length movie released in IMAX 3-D! The film is opening on Nov 10th in thousands of theatres nationwide in a flat 2-D version; and in Giant Screen IMAX 3-D in equipped theatres on the same day.Don't bother with the flat version, see it in 3-D. This is polarized 3-D using clear glasses, not the inferior red/blue anaglyph stuff used for SPY KIDS. Take your kids to a REAL 3-D movie!"
1,Nightmare in 3-d,"Loved the 2-d version & the 3-d movie version. This version is awful! Gave me a headache after only 5 minutes. The scenes were either red or blue, no vibrant colors, uncomfortable glasses, double images. I would not recommend this 3-d version at all. I do not remember the old 3-d movies but I thought technology would have improved since the old days, I guess it has not!! If you are thinking about buying this do not even bother! I wrote a complaint to the website address on the back maybe if other unhappy buyers do the same we will get an answer!"
4,"OK. Is it or is it not, in 3D?","I saw the movie in an IMAX theatre and enjoyed it a great deal. I'm a 60 year old man who watched the House of Wax, Charge at Feather River, Hondo, etc., in 3D when they first were released, in the 1950s. I love the process and am happy that more movies are getting duplicated in 3D for the big screen...and the little ones too.The description, for both the standard and Blu-Ray version, states: ""The version of the film on DVD is the standard theatrical version, not the 3-D version seen in IMAX theaters. --David Horiuchi""The term ""3D"" is set out, on the DVD box, in larger font than the name of the movie, but Amazon includes the claim that it's a flat version, and nowhere refers to it as ""including glasses"" as it does for ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.""I'm not buying until I know...but, it is a really good movie."
3,Better parts than sum,"Hate to be a Scrooge, but this is a train-wreck of a movie (pun intended). It's as if the film-makers set out to see how many different themes, visual effects, musical styles and Tom Hanks's they could cram into one movie. I really have no idea what the film is about.Having said that, many of the things that are crammed into this movie are well done. The music is great, especially the duet between the African-American girl and the boy from the other side of the tracks. The roller coaster effects were great, I wish I could have seen this in the theater--it would be really cool on IMAX. Although I'm not sure we need to more apologetics for Santa Claus, the movie has some thought provoking insights into the nature of faith in general.For parents: there are some spooky scenes which may be inappropriate for small children. My kids (aged 8-13) liked it a lot, however."
1,Zero human or holiday spirit,"This movie is one of the worst of all time and will remain so for eternity. It has absolutely no spirit, or soul, of any kind. From characters to digital effects, it's a totally *cold* movie, period. Watching it was very painful from the very start, a chilly experience."
3,Decent film,"This probably would've been a better movie if done with real live actors. The characters looked weird and some of them even scary, there was no life to their faces and eyes, I just couldn't really connect with anything.And the dancing waiters? FREAKY hahaHalf way through the movie I was sitting there wondering what was the point, it's a kid on a train getting himself into problems, some problems didn't even make sense. The plot was weak...BUT towards the end it got a little better. The action scenes were pretty good, those helped the movie a lot.Overall I enjoyed the movie more towards the end."
1,Polar Express STINKS!!!!!!!,"The Polar Express is one of the worst movies I`ve ever seen. First the story is just dumb, I mean a bunch of kids getting on a train and going to the North Pole. It`s impossible to do that anyway because the North Pole is an island! And the kids get tickets thats stupid because they let the kids on the train why would they need one when there in the train? And the guy who hole punches how does he do it so fast? Did he take advanced hole punching at Dork University? Whats with the room with the hanging puppets real scary not. When they go through the present thing like anyone would do that. And the hillbilly who if you pull his beard he can talk to caribou I mean come on. The only good thing was the cutting edge graphics. I rate this two thumbs down one star."
3,Slow Movie,This seller provided me with a perfect copy of the movie BUT the movie is just not a great movie. I bought it to add to my holiday movie collection and was disappointed. It puts the kids to sleep. Just not that great. Tom Hanks puts them out.
1,Low-tech loser,"In this ever-changing high tech world, I have fallen prey to ignorance. We had just purchased an HD plasma TV and could not wait to view this wonderful movie in HD. What no one told us was the DVD player had to be HD also. And the battle between HD and Blu-ray dvd is not over -who knows which will win??? Meanwhile, we own a dvd we can not view!"
4,"What a wondrous creation from the very stars above! 4.2 stars.,",Enchanting. Innocent. Adorable. Instills Hope. Charming. Lovely. Interesting. Lulling. A Rarity. Christmastime. Expanding. Adventure. Like-able. Tempting. Engulfing. Young-at-heart. Snow is everywhere. <3.4.2 stars.
4,I liked it,"I was amazed by the animation, which from time to time is difficult to distinguish from live action movies. I would love to see the 3-D version. I looked at the book again (for the first time in about 10 years or so) after seeing the movie, and was surprised to see that all the scenes in the book were close to the movie. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and I enjoyed all of his performances in this. I also thought the appearance of a little elf named Steven Tyler was hilarious!"
2,Not Very Good Quality,"The 3D effects were not quality. A lot of green, red and dark spots while watching the movie. I tried watching it with my expensive good quality glasses as well as the ones that came with it. Same thing with both. Disappointed..."
1,would noy play,Simple.... Would not play on my Blue-ray Disc DVD Player. Returned this one and ordered one that I hope will play on my 3D unit. Should have known by the price something was wrong. I have to read more careful what I am buying.
5,Christmas Magic,It is a wonderful movie. It capures the essence of the Christmas spirit and Christmas magic that children need. Believing.
2,Poor 3-D,"My expectations were dashed after viewing on my new Sharp Aquos 70 inch 3-D TV 20 min. into the movie. NOT 3-D at all. My grandchildren took off their 3-D glasses to watch the movie. Viewing was a hassle, as well as ruined the original color graphics by making everything look red and blue. Just terrible."
5,A true Christmas classic,"My husband, myself and our 9 year old son really enjoyed this movie. It was magical and exciting and it tugged at your heart strings all at the same time. It brought back many childhood memories of the curiosity of Santa and the desire to always believe. May we all hear the bells ring this Christmas. Go see this movie, it will make you remember what Christmas is truly about."
1,Horrible take on the book.,"I went to see this last winter with some friends from college. I saw that Tom Hanks had a hand in making this flick. Normally I have been very pleased with his work, but this movie downright disappointed me! It had great special effects, but very little to do with the actual story.Every Christmas Eve, my mom reads the book to my sisters and me, and it seems the magic is still there. But this movie wasn't magical at all."
2,Regarding the 3D.....,"I will not provide a review of the movie as there are plenty of movie critics out there. I will however, concentrate on the in-home 3D aspect of this movie. Of all the new Blu-ray 3D movies I have, this is the worst and most disappointing - especially after seeing what was possible with this movie in the IMAX. as with the anaglyph 3D version of this movie, the image on this Blu-ray 3D ghosts terribly which absolutely ruins the entire movie. The only advantage over the analglyph version was an obvious improvement in the picture color. If I could turn back the clock, I would avoid this purchase until the company releases a clean version."
2,Don't get the 3D version..waste of money.,"The movie is great, but the 3D effects are horrible. You see ghostly images and the 3D aspects have no depth. I EMAILED WARNERBROS ABOUT OFFERING A REPLACEMENT DISC AFTER THE PROBLEM GETS FIX. EVERYONE DO THE SAME. LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE DISC AND MAYBE THEY WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!"
5,The Best Christmas Story Ever,"My family - daughter, son-in-law, and my two grandchildren ages 4 and 5 - rode The Polar Express near Mt Hood Oregon... it was a great replication of the story including hot chocolate and a visit from Santa Claus himself. I purchased this DVD so we could all re-visit this fabulous experience... this is a great movie and I also bought the book. My plan is for us all to watch the DVD on Christmas day and then I will read the book to my grandchildren on Epiphany when their family celebrates the coming of Christ."
5,Awesome!,"My 3 year old LOVES it. I think it has helped him understand Christmas and Santa, highly recommended from us."
3,Polar Express DVD Gift Set,"Make sure you're OK paying a premium price for a plastic snow globe and little 2 piece toy train about 6 inches long. I bought the gift set expecting something nicer in the snow globe but was disappointed and don't think the extra money was worth it. However, my 5 year old grandson really likes the snow globe and I don't worry about him breaking it, so that's some consolation."
2,Middle Aged? Still Blame Your Parents? Buy This Book,"While the writing is certainly readable, it isn't without frustration. There were times I wanted to shake the author out of her deulded state. I do think there comes a point in your life when you have to accept the things that have happened and move on. Parents are not perfect. Find me a person who thinks their parents made all the correct child rearing decisions. That person is lying. While the author does not blame all her troubles on her family, these are the moments that scream the loudest. It's okay to pout about your parents and how they raised you, but to write a book about it after the age of nineteen suggests a deeper problem."
3,not bad,"there's a lot here i liked.... but i have a complaint about this book... and perhaps it will be viewed as very superficial, yet nontheless it had an effect on me (and a few other readers i've spoken with)... it's the cover.... i'm really bothered by the glamorization of smoking on the cover. okay, so it's in the story... but still, book covers are ads, and when smoking is glamourized in other ads, it is viewed as irresponsible. i think that's the case here as well."
3,Not what we expected,"We had great expectations for this book. After all, we were living on a cruising sailboat in the Sea of Cortez and we kept seeing all these great rock formations along the coast and wanted to learn more about them and how they had been formed. Unfortunately, this book didn't give us much insight. However, we couldn't find any other books that did any better, so I'm giving it 3 stars.The book does NOT cover all Baja, but rather just the Punta Chivato area, between Santa Rosalia and Mulege on the east side of the peninsula. The hikes are virtually impossible to do, as a result of housing and other development right on the land described -- most of the landmarks have been obliterated and many of the geologic features have been destroyed (NOTE: we found this true when we were there in the summer of 2007, and there has been more development since then). However, it still is semi-interesting reading."
2,"Like watching a train wreck;you know you shouldn't look,BUT","Blessed Goddess, I HOPE this was a terribly skewed book! It presents a fascinating but ultimately nauseating portrait of Alex Sanders (founder of the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca) as an egotistical, hateful, perverted individual. I found this in a second-hand shop, and horrified, read it cover-to-cover. Contains black & white photos of historical interest to modern Witches, and features naked Pagans dancing 'round a bonfire on the BACK of the dust jacket! Amazing that this book (full of photos of naked Witches) got published in 1969! Salacious, bizarre, and not-at-all flattering to Alex Sanders...I wonder if he sued after publication?"
3,Disappointed . .,Not what I remembered from several years ago. Didn't really work for my body chemistry. Might be good on other people though.
1,not what I expected,"just a bad scent, not at all what I imagined from description, smells exactly like the chemical ladden perfume counter in the department store."
2,Not very tasty...,"If this was a large, hardcover book with a lot more pictures it would make a nice coffee table book. However, it's a small, paperback book with a good number of pictures (some so small as to be only decorative), a fancy font that makes reading annoying, and not very much information of interest to those hoping to grow their own fruit. There are better books out there for beginners, including those by Stella Otto."
5,Thank You!,"I was always uptight about my iPod getting scratched or broken and I almost wouldn't take it out of my room, but with the case I can be a little more relaxed. The kickstand feature is great for watching videos so you don't have to hold it. I bought the black color and it looks very stylish. So I give it 5 stars for being functional, feesable, and most-importantly good looking."
2,ONE MAJOR FLAW,PRODUCT IS GREAT BUT THERE IS PLASTIC OVER THE MENU SECTION WHICH CAUSES DIFFICULTY IN USING IT. I HAD TO CUT IT OUT..PROBLEM SOLVED. U WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TESTED IT.
3,Not in Original Packaging,This came in inside a small zip lock bag rather than sealed in original packaging.Priced a little higher than some other similar products on e-bay I was hoping for a new unopened product.Shipping was also slightly delayed by a day.I am not sure as to the longevity of the battery but I am keeping my fingers crossed.
5,For those who remember it from childhood,"This little book is for those who remember it from childhood. Hard to find. Beware of used sellers who try to take advantage with outrageous prices. This was modestly priced, delivered quickly and in the condition described."
2,Not as it seems.,I bought this item for a gift and the Amazon pic did it no justice. It looked like a piece of plastic that came from a bubble gum machine. The only nice thing I would say is it's size and the price. Just wish it looked like the pic instead.
1,small sliver pentagram,"I'm very disappointed with this pentacle, it said small but I did not know it was that small, I was at least expecting the size of a dime or quarter, seriously who is supposed to wear a pendant that small a doll?. a complete waste of money."
2,Last Choice,"I wanted to learn more about African Cichlids, I'm enjoying the hobby of keeping them. This DVD is scientific but for the most part unadaptable to keeping them in an Aquarium. The cinematography is great at times. The DVD has helped me understand Cichlids in there natural habitat a little better, more so what/how to feed them. The narration is unbearable. The case and menu needs updated to suite 2010."
1,P and U! What a stinker!,"When my best friend's sister said this was the worst movie she'd seen in years, I should have listened. Figuring this movie had Bruce Willis AND Michelle Pfeiffer(and Rob Reiner directing) , how bad could it be....?My husband and I are non-violent, happily married people but we were hoping the characters would have take two pistols,twenty paces and simultaneous shots..it would have been easier than watching this stinker.Save your money and buy a classic movie for your collection instead!"
2,"Dull Movie, drab DVD","This is a movie about how difficult women are and how the secret to staying married is to put up with a lot of nonsense until they'll realize how spoiled they are. My wife thought the movie was about something completely different but I don't know what she said I wasn't really listening.DVD Commentary by Rob Reiner is sparse - many long pauses, as though he really had nothing much to say about this film."
1,A disturbing and disappointing film,"This movie takes the viewer through the turmoil of a disfunctional relationship. There is no redeeming quality, no art, and no message or statement to be found in this movie. If you like listening to (and watching) people argue, then you will enjoy this movie. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen."
4,Good Movie,"Heartwarming and endearing, this story is one everyone can relate to. Good movie to curl up and watch on a rainy afternoon."
1,A Boring Movie,"I saw this movie a few days ago and i have no intention of seeing it again, the movie had a good promo and sounde like a great movie, but after i saw it i was very disappointment. The movie started nicely, but after the five first minutes i saw it was a regular movie, parents depart parents go back to each other. it is niether an emotinal movie, nor a funny one- i wouldnt recommanded it."
2,way too sappy.,"The problem with the movie is it was about divorce without ever examining why their marriage wasn't working. I saw a similar movie that was much better called SHOOTING LILY on cable a while back, also about a couple going through divorce. Go check out that one instead."
2,"Marriage From Hell, Movie From Hell!","If you Like To Watch A Film In Which A Married Couple Are Yelling And Screaming At Each Other During Two-Thirds Of The Film, Then This Movie Is For You! The Only Reason I gave this Film a 2 Star Instead Of a One is That the Performances are Good! Speaking Of Performances, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE MICHELLE PFEIFFER A DECENT FILM TO STAR IN, I am So Sick of seeing her Perform In Films that are Beneath Her!"
3,"Good, but...","This was a pretty good movie. But it was also weird. And in some parts boring. It definetely doesn't deserve any award, but it had it's moments"
4,Reality,"This movie portrays the ""real"" life situations of self-seeking self-autonomous relationships that spiral uncontrollably towards divorce when married couples seek to control the relationship or change their spouse. While some of the references to sex seemed to be added for shock effect, the reality is that without some sense of ""us"" guiding a relationship the reality is the meaningless and vanity that the husband and wife experience in most of this movie.Some cheesy scenes and: (1) Who sends their kids to camp all summer and (2) Who believes their kids are oblivious to their parents marital problems?In the end, though, the recognition of communal fellowship grounded in the other brings hope to the tyrannical, self-consuming, and chaotic relationship which is symptomatic of current American society."
5,a male pig's perspective,"I'm sitting here, half drunk recently alone again. I put in the only ""chick flick"" romantic movie I own, ""The Story of Us"". Since the first time I saw this movie I have loved it, and I'm a war, epic film buff to see my collection. This is the only movie I asked for in my divorce because I wanted it THAT bad. Rob Riener's best work ever in my opinion. A movie that jumps around from place to time and back again so often, it keeps you riveted to the seat. The dialog is the heart of the story. And the way, under Riener's direction, Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer portray this stuggeling couple, makes me feel part of the story, not just watching it from a distance.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes sappy romance movies or believes in true matter of the heart."
1,what a disaster,"dragging and stretching and it didn't really express any emotion in spite of the screaming, arguments, tears.very artificial. Some movies are just too terrible for words."
3,Good movie,I actually couldn't watch this movie all the way through because I am not into lovie-dovie movies but it was decent and Bruce WIllis is hot as always!
2,Star Turn,"This movie was a sugar coated, jagged little pill that became hyper-saccharine with a bogus, tie-it up-with-a-neat-little-bow ending.Setup: Drag us through the muck, make us chuckle now and then. Payoff: Hit us with a happy Hollywood ending for our patience.Actors are great. Dialogue is uneven, but now and again it is dyamite. But then it devolves into a skit. Then dynamite, then skit ... you get the picture. The characters' flip-flops at the end are unnervingly bogus. It's the writer saying: I think you are really this gullible to the audience.Would have been way more effective if it ended on a low note."
4,A True Love Story,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh and cry, but mostly laugh. I was so glad to finally see a movie that portrays a marriage the way it really is, with good times AND bad. I thought they had great chemistry in the movie, and some of their arguments in the movie were very familiar to me. Overall a great movie for anyone who's married, or ever wants to get married."
2,"The More Clichéd the story is, the harder it falls.","The Story Of Us is noticably recycled material. The story of a marriage through it's ups and downs may be ture ot life, but this is just plain and simple boring. This film is blunt, annoying, and unfunny in it's comedic endeavors. For a better example of a sharp, witty and real movie of the same theme, check out Two For The Road with Audrey Hepburn instead."
3,Uninspired,"I hate to say this about a Rob Reiner film, but I have to say that this film is long on production values and short on depth.The story is easy to watch, with good visuals, good acting, interesting dialog, and such.But I kept watching for some level of understanding and insight, either from the characters, or at least from the filmmakers. But it never came. The characters stumble blindly through a dysfunctional relationship. Until the end, that is, when a feel-good ending is tacked on out of the blue. I would have expected much more with the resources they had to work with."
4,Uplifting Flick -- Recommended,"I expected a maudlin yawn-fest ... a run-of-the-mill slog through a marriage's predictable ups and downs ... I was wrong! Instead, I found a funny and touching portrait of a struggling marriage. This movie feels quite true-to-life and features characters who are flawed but likable and familiar (as in looking-in-the-mirror-familiar). A great cast and enjoyable soundtrack add to this flick's appeal. Satisfying ending, too! When the movie was over, my first thought was, ""that was time well spent"" ... and God knows, that doesn't happen often enough these days. Recommended."
4,Great! .........Touching yet Funny!,"This certainly isn't worth an Oscar...But this film has both its sad and emotional parts, as well as its funny moments from the supporting cast. The chemistry displayed in the movie isn't great; but nor should it be after all this is supposed to be a couple having trouble with their marriage. Both Willis and Pfeiffer give an excellent performance in this extremely touching, funny, and romantic film."
4,A better Rob Reiner Movie,"I've seen this in the past and just watched it again last night. This movie is very well acted, the script is very good, mosty marrital strife, but there is some levity. It is a very good movie and I highly recommend this movie to others who like drama dialog driven movies. This isn't the normal fluff you expect from Rob Reiner. Pfiffer and Wilis were very good and had good chemistry in both hating and loving each other. This movie, again is for those that like drama, dialog movies, mostly for married or serious relationship folks who are 30 plus and have a mature aspect of the up and downs of relationships. After seeing it the second time, I am buying it."
4,Don't expect a romantic comedy,"This film jumps back and forth between genres, which is a good thing. The whole point of the film is to depict the highs and lows and mediums of a marriage. Accordingly, there are funny momments in the film, dramatic momments, and just plain normal momments.What I'm trying to say is, if you just sit back, relax, and watch the film you won't be disapointed. If you're waiting for the punchline every five minutes, or waiting for candlelight dinners and sonnets, you will be disapointed.To sum it up, this is not a film for people who are looking to be entertained. This is a film for fans of 'reality' films.The acting is wonderful, the directing is great and the ending is solid. If you can handle the previous things I mentioned, you'll love this film!"
4,Bright and digestible material that's excellent for children,"Windrow's children's book The Greek Hoplite is a fairly good book, not groundbreaking, but it would make a good gift to the kid who is starting to show an interest in ancient history. The text covers most of the bases of the origin and lifestyle of the typical Greek citizen-soldier in a very simple and easy to read style of writing. The illustrations are bright and colorful, which makes it fun to read. The only point I wish Windrow would have emphasized more is how independent the Greek city-states were. Other than that, it's a very good book that's almost up to par with what Nick Sekunda has to offer for the younger crowd."
1,Not so much,"The product decription stated that the charger was compatible with my camera. However, upon recieving the product it was clear that this was not compatible and would be unable to charge my camera. Very disappointing."
1,It arrived torn.,"Unfortunately, this item arrived with a 4 inch tear and a replacement will not be shipped until April 3. By then,a winter motif won't really work. I guess I'll save it for next year."
1,Insightful,This book gave me insight into German culture. It is no wonderthere was a Holocaust with children's books like these. Max and Moritz are adventurous children and they are caught. Being caught isn't enough. They are ground in a flour mill for punishment. Not even that suits the miller. he feeds their remains to the ducks. It instantly reminded me of concentration camp victims being cremated and then turned into soap. This story will forever give nightmares.
2,Incredibly tedious.,"First person narrative consisting mainly of the uninformed scheming and random thoughts of the protagonist. Very little action or description. Annoying inconsistencies (at one point the author forgets it's a weightless environment). Almost all the characters are kids, and act like it. Great cover art."
5,one of the best sci-fis I've ever read,"This is one great book. I could not put it down. And you DO want to savor every word from his descriptions of the smells in a 2000 year old ship to the complex thoughts of the main character. It is a mystery and a sci-fi all in one and it really makes you think, pondering not only the vastness of space but about what it means to be alive."
2,Hard to finish,"Not a very good book. It starts off okay, but soon begins to read like an unrevised first draft--the characters are cardboard, the dialogue sounds nothing like people really talking, important events are summarized instead of depicted in detail, the author seems to forget that it's a zero-G environment, and events that should be significant (e.g. the protagonist steals a weapon from the captain's personal quarters) have no consequences. Some of the speculation on the ship society is interesting, but the faults make it impossible to suspend disbelief, which make this book a very hard slog.(...)"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The Dark Beyond the Stars was a book I had a lot of trouble getting into, and it ended up not really interesting me at all. On a starship on a really, really long flight a young occupant keeps getting into accidents, and soon, it appears, that someone is actually trying to kill him and make it look like that is not the case."
4,I would recommend this book...this is a must have.,"I could relate to this book because I am from the KC area and it was nice to be able to identify some of the landmarks that were described in the story. And the story was very interesting. Kind of a intercity fairytale with alot of reality thrown in. This is definitely not a happy ever after type of story...more of a can't wait to see what happens next type of story! Please pick this one up, you will find it hard to put down."
1,Review Change,"I just received a contact from the owner of this company. Not only did she refund my money but REQUESTED THAT I NOT RETURN THE KIT. I still do not care for the kit but THIS COMPANY HAS SUPERB CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO TRY ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. i WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THE STAR RATING TO 4 BUT AM UNABLE TO DO SO IN THIS EDIT.I ordered this kit and it was received in about 5 days. Then my trouble began. This is a kit with split dowels through which you pass your canvas then it is tightened. The longer dowels were 1/16"" smaller (doesn't sound like much)and fit too loosely. The side stablilizers could not be tightened enough to hold the canvas.Another thing, small wing nuts are used as tighteners and, as a senior, caused pain to my hands when trying to screw them tightly. When I tightened the stabilizers, it caused the cross pieces holding the canvas to bow and the canvas slipped out of the center area."
4,necessary crosstitch tool,Serious crosstitchers find these frames work very well. They have to be replaced every so often - the threads on the screws wear out.
4,"practical, love it","item came before estimated delivery date; wood cuts are rather rough and one of the frame pieces arrived cracked at the end, but this does not affect the integrity of the frame as a whole; once you start stitching you will lose tension"
4,"Finally, and as good as I'd hoped... almost","Wow, modern rock actually lives. The comments by other listeners are accurate enough. I just wanted to add that I was a bit disappointed in the album version of the songs that were released on the Blue Monster promo, hence not a 5 star review. Even taken into account the preference we often have for the version we hear first, I still think those recordings are better - you might try hunting them down."
3,"Good acting, but not much more","Storywise this stylish movie made in the Arizona desert does not offer anything special, it's been done before and after: Older women who are deliciously bad and do not hesitate to plan and commit murder. The performances of the main actresses are a great delight to watch (especially the opening scene). Geraldine Page is hamming it up nicely, Ruth Gordon for once does not play a brash, vulgar loudmouth but is emulating the great character acress Thelma Ritter as Page's servant. At moments this movie made me think of John Sayle's Passion Fish. Was it an inspiration for that truly great piece of art?"
4,"""Baby Jane"" meets ""Sweet Charlotte""","Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon are the formidable females of this Gothic ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?""/Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" spin-off. Page is an Arizona widow who maintains her very comfortable lifestyle by murdering her housekeepers and appropriating their savings. Gordon is a tough amateur sleuth who hires on as her next victim in hopes of getting to the bottom of missing persons mystery. A very fine, entertaining tale of suspense. I dare say it's more than a little farfetched at times, but the strong performances by the veteran leading ladies are always believable and make the film reach the pinnacle of art. The newly restored, widescreen edition from Anchor Bay is absolutely flawless and is a must!!!!!"
2,not a fan,love both actresses. could not get into this. geraldine page is too good at being diabolically crazed to be humorous to me. might have been more interesting if the roles had been reversed. ruth gordon would have given the role the camp it needed.
4,whatever happened to aunt alice?,"I have always liked ruth gordon. I liked this movie also because geraldine page was a bit subdued at times and let ruth gordon take the lead. If you like geraldine page,and love ruth gordon , this is a great movie."
3,What Ever Happened?,I purchased this dvd on spec due to the rave reviews but found this film to be highly over-rated for my taste. The acting was fine but the plot was simple.
2,Creepy 70's tv look,"I found this dvd hard to watch because of the old 70's look. The fashions of the time are very stale. It is not like ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" which I found enjoyable to watch and not very dated (except for the beach ending)."
3,Pretty scary; definitely fun!,"The original poster of this movie really stayed in my memory! Even though I was four when the film first came out, I remember my family talking about the plot of murders and people buried in the garden. Over the years, I'd seen parts of it on TV, but finally broke down and bought a copy of the video. Definitely worth the money! While it's not the scariest movie I've ever seen, the premise is pretty creepy, not to mention macabre! I LOVED Geraldine Page's cackle sewn throughout the film; that really added a campy twist. All the acting was fine, and for an addition to the 'Baby Jane' genre, 'Aunt Alice' definitely holds its own!"
4,realistic depiction of relationships,"Rarely have I seen a novel that shows relationships with ex-spouses not filled with hatred. I would like to think that many if not most dissolved marriages were based on something in the first place, and that that something doesn't entirely go away when the divorce is final. And the sparks may still be flammable, even though a current relationship may well be much better. Like the first reviewer, I couldn't put this book down. To me an entirely realistic novel with an intriguing premise."
1,Hard to Say,"Very Hard to review since both times I purchased this Ornament as a Christmas Present, it arrived crushed due to improper packaging, I am making one more attempt, cross your fingers.....!!!!"
3,OK Collection,"Given the choice of this or ""The Very Best of Rainbow"", you should definitely go with the latter. It is a better collection, with more cuts. I would also recommend ""Final Vinyl""."
5,Excellent CD!!,"Good mix of great tunes on this cd! I would have put Gates of Babylon on it instead of Rainbow Eyes, even though it's also a good Dio tune. Love the Joe Lynn Turner selections! Definately meant to be cranked up!!"
4,Rainbow,Good hard rock music plus some good Ritchie Blackmore licks on the guitar.Ronnie Dio excellent on his vocals on the CD.
3,Rainbow is Rainbow,"Although some - and possibly be all - of Rainbow's regular albums (e.g. Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, Rainbow Rising, Long Live Rock'n'Roll, etc.) may be better than this selection, it is still a pretty decent one and could be recommended for those who want to get familiarized with Rainbow's music. This selection is of less interest and value for those who know the band's music well, probably. However, it gives a pretty good idea of Rainbow's musical efforts, which are still to be discovered and appreciated by many true rock music fans. And when I say ""rock music"", I mean ""hard rock"" first of all. So if someone is into boys' bands (which is nothing wrong but definitely not my area of interest), that's not your stuff."
3,Good price for OK scope,This scope is well priced but the quality is just OK. Easy to zero in but can never zoom in to get it magnification clear enough.For the price it's a good buy but you pay for what you get. I should have stuck with a bit of a higher end scope.
5,A must buy!,"Wonderful product. My husband would highly recommend this to anyone for the price, the scope is clear and easy to set. He mounted it on his AR-15."
3,Works ok,"Took a little while to get it zeroed on my mini 14, but once zeroed, performed addequately.Still continue to test."
3,Very bright scope,very bright easy pull up has very nice fit and finish would tell any body this is a great product for the money spent
5,Great scope,"Ordered this scope for my Optima 209 .50 cal inline muzzle-loader, and was quick to site in and very accurate. I was able to get 1"" grouping at 100 yards. Scope is also very clear. I stayed at the range until dark, and even with very little light I was able to see the target clearly. I just ordered another one to replace the one on my .22. Can't beat the quality and price."
2,You get what you pay for,"I currently own one of these. I have it on top of a Remington 700 in .308. The rifle, scope, rings, and mount were all brand new. I took the setup to the range once in a new hard case (read I didn't abuse it). I put about 75 rounds through it, cleaned it and put away for the winter. When I took the rifle out to clean it, I found the rear lens of the scope was loose. I am not sure what happened, but now I gotta to have it shipped in for warrenty working.I should have known it was going to give me trouble.The scope held zero the whole time at the range and I had no troubles zeroing, which is why I gave witt two stars instead of only one."
3,Mounting Issues,"Received the World Class scope and looked fine in quality but lacked some features like focus and parallax adjustment that can be gotten in similar priced scopes. My main issue was that the distance between the objective lens and eyepiece ""bells"" was shorter than older Weaver models. Therefore, you will need an extention rear base to mount this scope. Even with an extention, you will have a limited adjustment range (moving scope forward or back in the rings) for comfortable positioning of your cheek on the stock. This seems to be a common issue for new model scopes. This is certainly the case for ""long"" actions like the 30.06 and others."
2,"Would be great, but ruined by Patton's clowning","Charley Patton is a likeable songster and all, and he gets your feet moving, but he is always throwing his guitar over his head and clowning around, sometimes all he does is beat on his guitar for an hour without ever playing anything. That isn't music, that's the march of time, and the march of time equals death. If Charley don't quit drinkin, he's gonna be dead of a heart attack soon one morning."
3,Shrek Bingo is just ok,"This is a fun DVD game for children who can recognize numbers, and can play regular Bingo. Different Shrek characters can be chosen to be the Bingo ""callers.""However, the erasable markers that come with the set can be easily obliterated by a small child's hand resting on the card; the marks smear very easily. I think the game could be improved by having paper cards that could be marked in pencil or crayon."
1,Terrible,"This game was awful. Not only was the speed of the bingo calling way to fast for my 8 year old, the dvd portion was very boring and monotonous. For that price and the technology we have today, this game was archaic and disappointing. Don't buy it unless you like boring things"
3,Good Classic Lutheran Theology At Work,"Prof. Rossing shows her Lutheran heritage well as one of the main differences between the Evangelical(Lutheran) Church of the 16th c. and its more radical offshoots was a stout defense against millenarianism/chiliasm which is what the 'LEFT BEHIND' series is all about. Condemned as erroneous almost 500 years ago, this error is still erronous-even in its new 19th c Darby-Scofield manifestation. While some within the Protestant camp (We Catholics have never been afflicted with this curse)may be discomfited; I challenge them to READ the book and then rethink what they have been told."
3,Good But Not What I Needed,"This book was certainly very readable and the writer clearly went to great lengths to provide an alternative view of the Book of Revelation. The problem I ran into was that the focus was excessively on being a response to the ""Left Behind"" books with their dispensational, premillenial eschatology. This focus was downright distracting at times, as was the repetition of key terms like ""Lamb power."" Conservative evangelicals would not be convinced by this book, mainline believers who care enough to read the book may appreciate it, but I'm going to have to keep looking for a book that delves deeper into the actual meaning of this apocalyptic book in its historic context."
3,Throws the baby out with the bath water,"First the good news: Barbara Rossing has written a very good critique of the ""Left Behind"" series. She summarizes the books very well and explains the theology behind the books and their authors, LaHaye and Jenkins. It one the better summaries and critiques I have read of this popular but dreadfully written series.Now for the bad news. She doesn't believe in a second coming (with or without a rapture), and she doesn't take the New Testament and particularly Jesus' repeated predictions of terrible things to come very seriously at all. But she does believe in Palestinian rights, ecology, feminism, liberation theology, etc., and has no problem spouting her views on these subjects.All in all, worth reading for the criticism, well written, but too much leftist propaganda for my taste."
1,Poor Scholarship,"This book represent what is wrong with theological writing today. Instead of a studied approach to the concept of rapture (a term used by the early church fathers when writing in Latin) what the author presents is a conglomoration of complaint, disparaging remarks, and simply made up facts. While I too have questions regarding the rapture this is NOT the book to read to investigate them. In short, the book made a great fire starter but nothing more.If you have questions about the rapture find another book to help you answer them. This is not worth the paper its written on and it exemplifies all that is wrong with supposed scholarship today!"
1,Disappointing,"Rossing's attack of the rapture seems more aimed at the fiction books in the Left Behind Series than at the Biblical doctrine itself. Taking a decidedly non-literal view of Biblical prophecy she of course does not think there will be a literal rapture. She also tries so hard to remove any ""judgment"" from the Book of Revelation than one is left to wonder if she is actually reading the same book the rest of us are."
5,"A thoughtful look at ""rapture"" theology","The only ""problem"" with this book is that the very people who most need to read this are those who most likely will shun its message. We need to get past the idea of the Rapture, which is a made up notion less than 200 years old, and get back to the real meaning of Revelation--God is with us to the end, no matter what trials face us. The ""enemy"" will be defeated.I wonder if we would recognize Christ when he does come back. The majority of Jews didn't recognize him the first time; what makes us think the majority of Christians will recognize him the second time? We have all these pre-conceived notions, and I think we will be in for quite a shock when he doesn't come exactly the way we expect him to."
4,Very good review,"The author methodically reviews the background and support for the current views on the rapture held by many fundamentalist Christians. When compared to her own academic review of scriptures this support is found wanting in many areas. She does not leave all conclusions entirely to the reader, but her book presents a clear and cogent argument for discounting many of the current views expressed in such books as are found in the Left Behind series."
1,Ignorance is Bliss,"It's amazing to me how someone with a title behind their name can spout this heretical nonsense as if it is fact! Mz Rossing has no real knowledge and/or understanding of the Bible, when she states that the land of Israel doesn't belong to the Jews. It's time she read the Old Testament prophets such as Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and I could go on! They constantly repeat that the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people, even to listing the exact boundaries. As for the rapture, it is well documented in a number of New Testament books. All I can say in closing is as Paul wrote in the first chapter or Romans: ""Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools"" !!"
1,Where in the world are our mansions?,"John 14:2 - In my Fathers house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.vs. 3 - And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.SO, you guys are saying Jesus will come back to earth, and stay here with us. It doesnt seem that way to me. If so , where are all these mansions? And where is God's house?"
3,The Rapture Exposed,The book is being used for discussion in my Sunday School class. It is good info but since we all agree there isn't a lot for us to discuss. It is good for a pro/con class on the rapture.
3,Theologically great; politically disappointing,"A great job on debunking rapture theology. A beautiful interpretation of the book of Revelation. But, spoiled by her extreem leftist political views which color the whole book. All but says there is a vast, right-wing, conservative Christian, conspiracy to get us into the war in Iraq, encourage the bullies of Israel to pick on their Arab neighbors, and destroy the planet by not caring about environmentalism and global warming. I was very disappointed that she didn't stay in the theological arena, where she is an expert; and stay out of the political arena, where she is somewhat less of an expert. She is certainly entitled to express her views but I was left wondering how much her political agenda influenced her theological conclusions. Still, a worthwhile read."
5,Rocket is always so flipping good and this is further proof,"My only complaint is that it is only 26 minutes in length. But what you get in the same span as a ... sitcom is the amazing strength of a band just blasting into perfection. From the electricity evident by Speedo and company with the onset of ""I'm not invisible"" through the wreckage of ""Too Many Balls"" you have a capsule of high octane pleasure. Rocket has found new life on Vagrant and the horns have never sounded better."
5,"quick,raw, and angry!",Dont listen to the negative reviews on this one. This is stripped down angry rock from beginning to end. No filler here.
5,Rockets' best yet,"The most prominent thing about Camp X- Ray is the fact that there is no filler-none whatsoever. Almost every other Rocket album has that one or more songs that are simply skipped, but not here. One thing people have to realize is that no one band can release album after album that sound exactly the same (to those so fond of saying 'oh its no State of Art, but...') RFTC have outdone themselves yet again."
5,Yet Another Great RFTC album.,"The only complaint is using the word ""Live"" as part of their album's name. It confuses those overly sensative woodbe rock critics.This album rips from beginning to end, which is probably why there are complaints about the album length. Anyway, RFTC definitely keeps you wanting more. If you want a pure rockin' album minus al the fluff of todays music PICK this one up."
4,Not the best RFTC album.,"That said, it's still better than a lot of music being released this year. It just doesn't live up to the other Rocket From the Crypt albums. This is a good album for hardcore fans of the group. If you are new to the group get Scream Dracula Scream, RFTC, or Hot Charity"
3,Necessary accompaniment to the Hudes deck.,"A good companion & necessary accompaniment to the Hudes deck. A bit of new Age without overkill.I find it most helpful not even for that specific deck, but as yet another perspective on the cards in general."
3,I wanted to like this film...,"I really did. I was so mad that all reviews I read basically called this movie crap, and I found it hard to believe after the first one was so amazing. So I watched it last night, and I find myself right there with everyone else. The guy who plays the teacher (from the Dead or Alive trilogy) should stick to Miike movies cuz thats what hes good at...over-the top acting that doesn't work in a supposedly serious movies like this. The gore wasn't as shocking as the first one because it was almost all guns and the necklaces. it was very preachy and the over delivery of what it was trying to say made me feel like i was at church being told that i was going to burn in hell from the pastor. If you loved the first film you should see this just don't buy it. Oh, and the end of the battle scene left me highly confused...you'll c what I mean."
1,"Yes, it is as bad as they say","I was a big fan of the first one. Then saw this one, and now have soured on the whole franchise. Stupid, silly, irritating and unintentionally humorous -- especially that stupid Riki character.We were booing the TV screen!"
3,so so,the first one was way better this is more mellow id say the action is less and their is more talking but its still an alright movie.
2,As usual sequels are rarely as good as the orginal,I really liked the first one. It had an interesting story. This one started off just as good. Then the kids meet the terrorist and the story made little sense. Then it went South very fast.Ironically the acting and special effects are better in this version.
1,"Avoid ""Board Dudes, Inc.""","I could not agree with L. Deeds more. I wish I had seen Deed's review before purchasing this product at my university bookstore.The cheap aluminum frame is attached to the fiberboard back by punching a hole into the frame to create a rough metal surface that ""digs"" into the back to hold it.To hang the calendar, you bend two very thin pliable metal strips (with holes in them) from the back to the front. You then put your nails through the holes and into the wall.In the process of bending these strips back, they came right out of the frame. The calendar fell, scratching my wall, and when it hit the floor the thin aluminum framing popped off and broke.This calendar is not worth the money; very poor design--avoid it!"
1,Should've read these reviews first,"I bought a Board Dudes 23 x 35 and it, too, is unmountable with the hardware provided. Or with any hardware, really, because I am rather adept at hanging things on walls (such as pictures and TVs) but I shouldn't have to reengineer something like this. Ridiculous. There is no secure way to hang the thing. Too bad, otherwise it would be a fine board. But they really skimped on the aluminum frame by not including some basic mounting mechanism."
3,Stop whining,"Hey, I paid 15 dollars for the thing. I don't expect that it was engineered by NASA. I got my own markers and used double sided tape to hang it. Use your brain and stop complaining."
1,"Mounting hardware does not work, keeps falling off.","Mounting hardware does not work, keeps falling off and the Velcro does not support the weight of the product. Also the edge of the frame was warped."
3,An Honest and Realistic Opinion,"I have been a Cranberries fan since they began and every album they put out I've listened to over and over again until I knew all the words, then listened to them a million more times. I can't do that with this album. I've tried, believe me. But it just isn't as catchy as all of their other ones. So basically I agree with a little bit of everyone on this. It isn't as good as their earlier stuff. But by no means is it bad, either. If you are a Cranberries fan I would definitely recommend getting it because it is a must have for your collection. You'll probably really like quite a few songs on it. But none of them will be your favorite Cranberries song. I will continue to listen to the album occasionally for something different, but I don't think it's going to grow on me as one of the best Cranberries albums of all time. I have faith that their future albums will be better though, so I'm not writing them off just yet."
3,"good, but follows the path too many artists have taken","Overall, this is a good cranberries album. It is by far their most approachable and best for a new fan of the band. Yet this band seems to have taken the path that bands such as Garbage and No Doubt have taken this year; theyve gone too pop! There arent any great lyrics any more, they are just now basic lyrics where the number 1 priority is for them to rhyme with eachother. The songs have too-familiar and catchy melodies that will have you hooked the first time you listen. But it lacks the depth of Bury the Hatchet, or No Need to Argue. The lead singer doesnt experiment with her soaring vocals that much on this album, either, which is disappointing because she definatley has one of the most distinctive voices in rock music today. So give this album a try if you are into pop, but i think its more of a disappointment, at least coming from the Cranberries."
2,Static remembrance,"2 1/2Try as they might, Cranberries were never quite able to recapture the essential spark that made their mild alternative rock so endearing on two start-up releases, so listeners slogged through a few more albums attempting to salvage redemptive scraps of melodic purity, as lyrical content stubbornly preaches. Even if some relatively solid songs remain, the juice feels all but extracted."
3,Wake up and smell the luke warm coffee.,"I own all five of their albums, and what I seem to notice, is that each album isn't as good as the one before it. Ok, maybe ""No Need To Argue"" is the exception, but this is my least favorite of the bunch. It's not bad of course, it just seems to be alot of filler to me. I only really like 5 songs alot, and 3 of them are also on ""Stars"", which means I'm pretty much keeping this just for ""Never Grow Old"" and ""Dying Inside"". I hope they make a comeback sometime soon, but as far as ""Wake Up And Smell The Coffee"" goes, get the other 4 first."
2,Total Disappointment,"Unfortunately O'Riordian had been lazy this time. Music 3 stars, Lyrics 1 star. Only Analyze could satisfy Cranberries fans a little..."
1,"I love craberries, but I hated this album!","I bought this CD because I am an avid Cranberries fan, but I was very disappointed!!! The lyrics [are bad]..., the writing is lazy, and the songs are entirely too short!Thier previous albums had exciting music and surprising lyrics, but this one is monotone, boring, and repetitive!Dont buy it! I dont care how much you loved thier previous music!!! Its not even comparable!"
1,whatever,cool cd. i really enjoyed it a lot.that is why i have given it one star.they are the best at what they do.she sings really well.they play good music.this compact disc bored me out of my mind.i took it from my girlfriend and threw it away.now i have to buy her something really nice or she'll sick the cat on me again.
3,wake up and get a proper title,"Not a bad album, but not the Cranberries @ their best. Shallow sing-along, with highlights here and there.Yes, an upbeat, friendly, nice, smiling, happy album. But we dont live in such a world, so wake up and face reality.""radiation...deprivation"" come on please !I get the feeling some bands just need to put something out in order to make those contracts. Something needs to pay for all the bills ..."
3,An Honest and Realistic Opinion,"I have been a Cranberries fan since they began and every album they put out I've listened to over and over again until I knew all the words, then listened to them a million more times. I can't do that with this album. I've tried, believe me. But it just isn't as catchy as all of their other ones. So basically I agree with a little bit of everyone on this.

I will continue to listen to the album occasionally for something different, but I don't think it's going to grow on me as one of the best Cranberries albums of all time."
3,More of the same,"If you liked early stuff, this will feel like a fine vintage. Not good enough for four stars for me..."
5,Cranberries have done it again!,"This is one of the very best albums I have listened too for some time. The Cranberries have done a masterful job with their latest album. The track Analyze is certainly one of the best songs the Cranberries have done. Listening to Delores' voice is like listening to an Angel's voice. I certainly recommend that you purchase this album, and buy one for your best friend."
1,Do not buy this one,"I bought this CD Knowing Lerner's music, in this CD his charm is lost since he invited other singers and ruined his music, if you don't believe me just buy it and you will be as upset as I am, now looking for a CD sing only by Alejandro Lerner."
1,Not 26 x 1 1/2,"These tires arrived in a bag, twisted and out of shape. What I needed was 26 x 1 1/2 ....these are 26 x 1.5 and will not fit on my wheels. I've since learned it was my mistake there is a big difference between a tire marked with a fraction and one marked .5, I thought .5 was a half but not in bike tires. So don't the same mistake I did. But still I thought they were poorly packed for shipping"
3,Some Interesting Releases,"Interesting array of diversified artists contribute to a mediocre soundtrack. There are some nuggets here, depending on your taste, that are not available elsewhere"
5,Fantastic sink for the garage!,"I bought this sink based on reviews of other customers, plus thirty dollars makes it a no-brainer!This is the perfect size to install in the garage without taking up valuable space. I don't have any use for a full size utility sink, they're just too big and take up too much of room.This Mustee sink is a great size for paint clean-up and gardening chores without making a mess of the surrounding area. Installation is a breeze, just three screws or bolts on top to the wall and put the drain on.One thing is due to it's narrow size you'll need to spend some time looking for a wall mount faucet with short spout that will fit. Since this install is about doing it on the cheap, I found a Zurn faucet with total spout distance of 8"" from the wall for $85. This faucet has a 3/4"" garden hose connection so it will serve dual purpose of being able to hose the kids off after a day at the beach.You can't go wrong with this sink!"
3,O.K. for low cost compact laundry sink for the home.,"This sink is a good low cost alternative for a compact wall-hung laundry sink. The poly plastic will stain and will not stand up well to severe use, so gentle home use is the best application. If you use it in a shop or manufacturing environment it will suffer more than a base mounted sink, or a certianly more than a stainless steel sink. But these are more or much more expensive. For most use this should sink be more than adequate."
5,Great Sink,"Sturdy construction and perfect for those locations where a normal mop sink wouldn't fit. It installs very easily, with only three bolts. Great sink."
3,Age Appropriate,"My 2 year old triplets use something similar to this in therapeutic play and I thought it would be good to have at home. The problem is that the pegboards they are used to don't require that you push to get the peg in. I will re-review in a few months time when they are perhaps more ready for the extra force required.Right now, they are a few months behind developmentally, and I would simply say that if you are purchasing this learning toy, make sure you are purchasing it for a child who is at least 2 developmentally. The pegboards that allow you to just place the pegs without pushing are just as educational as this one and easier for younger or less developed children."
5,Pegboard/Pegs Set,Great product for the price. Couldn't beat the price anywhere else online! I would choose to purchase this product again!
1,Died in less than two years,"This monitor died after about a year and a half of moderate to light usage. This is quite disappointing. I have had monitors last up to 10 years. If not for this, I would have said the monitor was great."
2,Disappointed!,"I bought a factory-refurbished one of these based on excellent reviews in several places. I wanted it for photo editing on a limited budget. I especially wanted a 4:3 aspect screen because that's the best for most photos. This seemed to be just what I wanted.Now I've disconnected it and reinstalled my dependable 15 incher. Many times over the past few months, the monitor does what I can only describe as ""flashing"". This happens unpredictably and not continuously.It's blinding and a bit scary but I usually have to continue what I was doing or lose it. (Also the Natural Color feature doesn't want to work on my Dell for no particular reason.)"
5,Gary Allan greatest hits,"Love the album, Gary has two new songs on this CD. If you are a Gary Allen fan this one is for you."
2,Gary Allan,I really don't care for most of the songs on this CD. I bought it because I really liked the one song on the CD and I can honestly say I only like 3 songs on the entire CD.
1,If you've bothered to study pinyin ... then this book sucks,"If you have no experience with pinyin, then this may well be a fine phrasebook. But if you have studied pinyin (or are planning to) this book will be hopelessly confusing.What were they thinking of?My 2 cents: like it or not, pinyin is the standard for transliterated Chinese. I recommend spending a little time to understand pinyin pronounciation and get a pinyin phrasebook. You'll be happier in the long run"
3,Disappointing for LP,"Lonely Planet miscalculated on this one. In this Fifth Edition, they decided to ""improve"" upon the rather intimidating Pinyin system for Romanizing Chinese by creating their own pronunciation system that is more natural for English speakers than Pinyin.Unfortunately, Pinyin is the official Romanization system in the PRC: street signs, highway signs, shop signs, and maps use Pinyin. Readers of this book may be good at pronouncing the words in it, but they will not be able to handle the Romanized Chinese they see on the street.I've located a used copy of the Fourth Edition (2000), which uses Pinyin, and I'll toss my Fifth Edition. Others seem to be doing the same, since used Fourth Editions are now selling at 2-3 times the price of new Fifth Editions! Too bad, because the Fifth Edition otherwise has a modern, attractive layout that is a genuine improvement."
2,Yeah...,"I agree, they really should have done it in Pinyin. However, I do like picture on the cover..."
3,6th ed. does use pinyin!,"Some of the negative reviews harp on this book for not using pinyin, but they seem to be referring to the 5th ed. The 6th ed. published in Sept. 2006 by A. Garnaut does have pinyin. That shouldn't be an issue.I have found this book useful, but it does have some basic vocabulary gaps. Also, I have been studying Mandarin for about a year, and I have just now found it really helpful. You could always point at the characters to ask questions, but if you are a new speaker of Mandarin, it won't help you if you have absolutely no background."
2,not what i expected,This book is written in the beijing style of mandarin which isn't how they ever teach mandarin in the US or how they speak it elsewhere. it is pretty much useless for learning mandarin if you want to learn it the right way or speak it anywhere other than beijing.
3,"Disapointing, I agree",I have to agree with Preston's review. I have just bought the fifth edition and was very dissapointed to find that it was not using pinyin. I used the fourth edition recently and found it wonderful. Its a pity they have made this mistake. I Better find a copy of the fourth edition before they are all gone!
1,A sad rewrite of the (formerly) best Chinese language guide,The abandonment of Pinyin was a devastating mistake. The new edition is useless for learning Chinese or speaking it. I have purchased at least six of the older editions. They will be much sought after now!
2,No Pinyin AND language errors!,"I am usually a big fan of Lonely Planet products but this little book really let me down. I've studied Mandarin for a few years. A book like this should be useful in that a traveler should be able to use it quickly and easily. Unfortunately the move away from ""pinyin"" to LP's own crazy system is irrational. It is neither intuitive nor useful. My other grievance lies with the book's numerous language errors. If a traveler has problems pronouncing something, he or she should be able to point out the sentence to a fluent speaker. With this book though, you could very well be asking the wrong question. Sometimes the Chinese characters, English translations, or the LP symbols do not match up. Lonely Planet needs to make some adjustments with their next edition if it's going to have any success."
4,I couldn't have survived without it!,"I think for the tourist, this phrasebook is invaluable. Honestly, in 2 weeks I wasn't going to learn to write or speak Chinese well enough to hold a conversation. I used this book as a rudimentary way of communicating, by looking up phrases or words, then pointing to the characters. It really helped me in quite a few different situations. Also made a nice conversation piece on a long distance train ride--the staff were looking up words and trying their English! I can see how this would be useless if you are trying to navigate street signs, or learn to speak the language. But for a tourist who will be in and out of the country, I thought it was great!"
3,If it helps you survive,"I had to buy this for a semester abroad in China and, truth be told, I never used it. I looked through it and I found some interesting stuff but using a phrasebook to get around isn't recommended except for emergencies (like transportation). Also, it helps to have some understanding of Chinese anyway because you can't just read the words of the page phonetically- you have to say the tone too."
2,Not a fan of this phrasebook,This phrasebook doesn't use the pinyin spellings of the words so natives can't read the text. It wasn't that helpful of a book and I had much better luck with just a translation dictionary.
2,Chinese Phrasebook,"When I started learning Chinese this book was strongly recommended by a friend. What a disappointment; it's not suited for learning Chinese it's to superficial. This book could possibly be of some help on a visit to China, but if you seriously want to learn Mandarin - choose another one. On the positive side: This book has an appealing layout, and is easy to use."
2,Surprisingly poor,"Over the years I've been a strong advocate of the Lonely Planet series of books - they've usually been pitched at just the sort of level of travel that suits my budget and interests. This was the first phrase book I bought by them and found it to be very, very disappointing. Not only is their pronounciation system a waste of time learning, many of the translations were found to be incorrect by my chinese friends in terms of sentence structure and word order. A number of key phrases weren't provided and the ""strokes"" dictionary in the back is also a waste. Also many words used in the phrases were not the same as the ones provided in the dictionary. Basically a lack of consistency throughout...a very, very poor effort and a very disappointed customer. LP should offer a refund."
1,I want a refund or LP should release 4th ed as a PDF,"This is a terrible book. The author has come up with his own pronunciation system that is only somewhat different than pinyin. So instead of having to learn the Chinese script, pinyin, and pronunciation and tones, you also need to create a key to translate between the LP system and pinyin. This takes a difficult task and makes it even more time consuming.If I could talk to the people at LP I would suggest giving anyone who bought this disaster a free pdf version of the 4th edition (a guy can dream can't he). Get the ""Rough Guide to Mandarin Chinese"" which is going to updated in April 2006."
5,"Quino y los médicos y, bueno, los enfermos","Fántastico, lleno de los guiños a la realidad tan propios de Quino. Bueno, tanto para médicos como público en general, porque todos alguna vez nos vemos necesitados de recobrar la salud y este libro contibuye de manera excepcional."
1,Poopbah,"Loud farts, the movement is common with constipation with the dancing Poopbahs and poop sounds definetly new age alright totally describes them."
1,SCARY TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,HI I AM A VERY SMART 3 YEAER OLD BABY. WHO WOULD WANT TO WASTE THEIR TIME ON A STUPID TOY.BOOKS ARE MUCH COOLER.THE SILLY SOUDS BOOBAH SOUNDS LIKE IT HAS CONSTAPATION OR HAS A BAD CASE OF DIE A REA. DONT BUY IT.IF YOU DONT BUY IT THERE IS A VERY SLIM CHANCE OF BECOMEING A VERY COOL BABY LIKE ME.BUT IF YOU DO BUY IT YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF BEING A VERY COOL BABY LIKE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Overall very good but the author needs to do more research,"I read this book and was very impressed with the women featured and the research that had gone into it until I reached Queen Victoria. Ms. Felder stated that Queen Victoria had commissioned the Victoria Cross for bravery where it was in fact her husband, Prince Albert, who commissioned the medal in his wifes name. It is of course a small point but it had me wondering what else was inaccurate in her book. Saying that though, her choices revealed women that I had not even heard of or realised their contribution to society as a whole, so where I would have easily given 4 stars as I found the book very educational I must deduct at least 1 for lack of research."
4,The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades,A very good book. A good review of history and a definite eye opener as to the thoughts and beliefs of Islamists. A must read for those who care about the future.
4,Open your eyes America,"This was a fascinating look into the violent history and present of Islam. It revealed an aspect of Islam about which no one is willing to talk. The downside, however, was that, toward the end, the book began to get repetitious and a bit tedious."
1,"Full of half baked truth, lies and misinformation","Robber Spencer uses this technique of lies.For example I say, ""My cat is pretty ugly""Robber Spencer takes that sentence and removes the last word to make it look like what I meant was, ""My cat is pretty"".These type of cheap shots he takes at Islam and his hatred for Islam is very transparent. His self-claimed ""scholarly"" works are refuted and shreded piece by piece on websites like [...]Also, see a lot of comments for critical reviews and hardly any for helpful ones."
3,PIG Islam,"Not as good as I thought it would be. Does not provide much insight, but makes you want to learn more."
1,Garbage,Arabs and the muslim religion are one of the few minorities left in this county that can be openly slandered at will and this opportunist and liar takes advantage of that bias and ignorance. This book is full of lies and garbage history. I spent many years in Arab countries while I was in the Marines and was wounded in Beirut. Unlike the chickenhawks who like this sort of tripe I've been there and know that equating all Muslims or Islam itself with terrorism is the same as saying all Christians are Timothy McVeighs or KKK'ers. Pathetic.
1,If I could give it ZERO stars I would.,"This book is written by a hatemongering, ignorant idiot who has no real sense of what is going on in the world, but would rather continue to fan the flames of ignorant hatred. If you want to read a really good book on Islam read Bernard Lewis's book or you could read Fareed Zakaria's book, The Future of Freedom. (And imagine, it's written by a Muslim who doesn't want to blow up buildings and kill Christians.) What saddens me more than anything else is that there are so many reviews for this book that use words like ""enlightening."" Nothing could be further from the truth. This may sound elitist, but stupid people should not be allowed to put their opinions out there for everyone to see. It might encourage more ignorant people to buy this awful book."
1,Despite the other reviews...this book is inaccurate,"I am a typical, blond haired, blue eyed, dyed in the wool patriot. Yet one thing is for certain, this book really twists the truth a lot!!!I won't bother writing a 5 hour count by count review. Just do this...go to your local bookstore, sit down and peruse any number of historically accurate accounts of the crusades. Neither side was innocent back then, however, we Christians were certainly cruel, murderous, treacherous and terroristic in our battles.This book by Spencer makes it out as if we are sweet little innocent victims. We are not. This does not mean we should be sorry. I cannot possibly be responsible today for what happened hundreds of years ago. I am simply saying...BE HONEST and UNBIASED if you're going to write about history."
1,Offensive polemic - don't waste your money.,"I agree wholeheartedly with Ms. Martie D. Kelley's review. There is no objective research and the ""facts"" Spencer states are verses pulled out of context. If you want to learn more about Islam and the Crusades, there are many other unbiased options that can provide a better and fuller understanding without resorting to the intellectually lazy and bigoted approach that Spencer used."
1,"Paranoid, nonsense","This book is just awful. Its written from the perspective and motive of hate and anger. How objective and fair can anyone be when they are angry or filled with such hatred? And on top of that, I sense such fear, such insecurity and such paranoid. Its a shame I had to give it even a star. Ir you want to learn about Islam properly, read something like Martin Lings, Muhammad or Roger DuPasquier, Unveiling Islam. Or get the Koran for Dummies or something like that."
2,A little all over the place,"I think the writer is a bit too emotional about the subject. It is clear he has done his research, but for me, it is a little too shallow and all over the place, at least the first half. I have not read the Crusades section yet (part2). It may improve there."
1,HILARIOUS!!!,"They say you must never judge a book by its cover, but by placing ""The crusades were a defensive war"" on the cover- well I just burst out laughing. (I hope Robert Spencer isn't so stupid that he actually believes what he says- but statements like that make me wonder.) It's hilarious that somebody thinks they can pass this fairy tale off as fact. For once, Spencer's ""research"" is more comedic than offensive. This guy is a regular Michael Moore!"
1,This book is a promoter of hate & full of bias,This book tries to pursuade readers about authors bias view of Islam & justifies more violence against muslims. Not sure why he would go so far to abuse Islam & Muslims.
1,?????????,"As a teenager and most importantly a muslim girl, I would say that ISLAM is the most forgiving religion so robert spencer do your self a favor and go get some education because these words show how IGNORANT YOU ARE"
1,DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE A STAR!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS ALL PROPAGANDA!!! THE CRUSADES ONLY OCCURRED BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH COULD NOT ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE, A DOMINANT CHRISTIAN EMPIRE SUDDENLY FELL TO THE OTTOMAN TURKS (PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIMS). WE OUGHT TO SET OLD TIMES LIKE THE CRUSADES ASIDE AND FOCUS ON THE PRESENT. THIS BOOK IS TRYING TO START/FUEL A MODERN-DAY CRUSADE!!! WHERE'S ALL THE LOVE?????"
1,A joke,"I bought this as a joke for my roommate. A bad choice- there weren't enough funny pictures and stupid commentary in there, so don't be fooled by the ridiculous cover. Not to mention the guilty feeling that you're giving money to this writer, and supporting all the people who write positive reviews of this book. Joke book buyers beware!"
5,Exceptional notation of sources,"If you ever had any doubts that a peaceful Islamic Society could co-exist with all the other faiths of the world; Read this book. It will put your fears to rest with insight and illustration of Koranic verses. Under praticing, orthodox Islam there can be no 'moderate muslims' and their options in how to deal with the unbeliever are black and white. Any doubters, please read."
4,Refreshing read,There is no better book on Islam than this one. A very Non-PC book and a fair guide to what every sane Westerner must know about the religion of Islam in a non-PC fashion.
5,WAKE UP CALL,"Much that seems absurd, disconnected and irrational now makes perfect sense. People who fly planeloads of innocent people into buildings filled with innocent people, videotape beheadings, blow themselves up and go psycho over a cartoon need to be understood. The hate-America left is not going to tell you the truth. Hollywood has already started rolling out the lies with the movie ""Kingdom of God"". Look no further than this very readable, well-researched book. Anyone who believes there can be any peaceful co-existance with these fanatics is kidding themselves."
5,Perfect Primer,"As a non-religious person who objectively views Islamofascism as a much greater threat to Western civilization than say, Jerry Falwell, I find this book to be the PERFECT PRIMER for anyone with a shred of interest in current events.It blows apart so many ""multiculti PC myths"" - too many to list here. And it's quite the easy read.Generally, there are three types of people that will dislike or ignore this book: Muslims unwilling to look in the mirror, Leftists that have long ago lost their minds to their multiculturalist hearts, and apathetc, ignorant folks (alas, the vast majority of us).If you know people who do not fall in these categories, pass this book on! My girlfriend and father are next in the queue!Highly recommended! And thank you Robert Spencer for risking your life to write the truth."
1,Oh please start over,"Manly, good virile propaganda for Christians at last! It would have been a perfect addition to my coffee table library--next to Guns & Ammo and other heterosexual magazines. That is why it pains me to point out a fatal error. The front cover features a guy from my own militia. He's a good Christian. Not an Islamicist."
1,"good muslim,bad muslim",instead of this garbage and a bunch of lies i invite all of u to read the book (!!good muslim bad muslim !!)by mamdani a correct description of the events leading to the current geopolitical situation in thie world that we live in today asthey used to say in the old days what goes around comes around
1,You are right this an INCORRECT GUIDE TO ISLAM,"This is book is far away from the truth and the facts about islam, I was surprised from the lack of knowledge in this book, really frustrated!! IT IS AN INCORRECT GUIDE TO ISLAM"
1,Think...,"It is interesting to see people think they know everything about a religion by reading a book written by a so-called 'expert' on Islam. I suggest to those who enjoyed this book, to take a college-level course on critical thinking. You may then be able to see things objectively, because it seems most of you are taking what the author says, and running with it as if it's the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.If I wanted to build a home, I would NOT hire my physician who only knows what a home looks like, to build it. Similarly, if I wanted to learn about the Christian tradition, it would be foolish to ask a Buddhist monk to teach me. Get the drift?Being a Muslim, I can see that there are many things which are being distorted about the religion. If you are really sincere in wanting to learn about Islam, Google up a local Mosque and ask someone who REALLY knows the religion, and not someone who only pretends to...May God guide you all to the Truth..."
1,Is This a Hateful Book by a One-sided Islamophobe? You bet!,"This light, breezy and easy-to-read introduction to Islam is a shocking and dishonest distortion of Islamic culture and history. The author relies upon selections from serious and far-from-serious books on Islam to present an unbalanced and devastatingly hateful image of Muslims. It's not that there are no grains of truth to Mr. Spencer's book, but they come packaged with half-truths, misrepresentations and an astonishing amount of venom. If you are looking for a book to close your mind and succumb to hatred, then seek no further! However, if you want to rise to the challenge of understanding the different cultures in our sadly battered world, then give this vicious polemic a miss. Remember: The Peacemaker Never Lost. And Mr. Spencer is not a peacemaker.P.S. Anyone with an ounce of Christian values will want to read Steve Bell's Grace for Muslims?: The Journey from Fear to Faith after this dreadful dirge."
1,"Lies, Lies and More Lies.","According to former President bill Clinton, over 300 Muslims from various nations died in the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on September 11, 2001.In addition a large Muslim prayer area was in the WTC to accomadate the daily prayers of the Muslims who worked there.Stop being misled by people who want their Gentiles to hate Muslims."
2,A little less Christian bias,"I have been looking for an objective rewiew of Islam since it is having such a profoundly negative effect on conditions in the world today. I was pleased that this book does document most of it's references so they can be checked, since I have seen some really wild ""quotes from the Koran"" which have no similarity to the actual text. However, the focus of the book seems to be to convince the reader of the superiority of Christianity. Since I am already a Christian, I didn't need that. Some comparisons are useful to an understanding, but there are far too many in this book. It does contain some useful information but you have to wade through a lot of anti-Musllim diatribe to get it."
1,NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER!!!,"I cannot review this book because I never received it. I also ordered ""Going Rogue"" by Sarah Palin -- never received either of these books. I took the tracking number to the Post Office and they say it was never scanned at their Post Office.What do I do now???I would either like to have my books, or my money refunded.Please AdviseMarilyn Cranemcrane@riogrande.edu507-475-1599"
5,This was eye opening reading....,I was in the dark on all of the Islim issues and needed a good look into the world of Jihad..This book is a very good read and has all the facts right.The side by side Mohammad vs. Jesus was a nice touch. I also liked the PC index...
5,An important book for America,"This book exposes the Muslim fanatics for what they are. After reading this book, there is no question, based on the facts, that these fanatics want to harm the West in their lust for global control. When one considers the murder of our soldiers and the tragedy that their families face when hearing about the death of a loved one from cold blooded killers, you wise up to the issues that threaten America, and the world as a whole by these fanatics. You will be dismayed by the facts and will be shocked by the thorough scholarship of Robert Spencer's work. The books is very lucid in its presentation and rallies irrefutable facts about the dangers that await Americans, and Westerners in general. America, wake up. Our mission in the Middle East is a noble one that secures our freedoms and dignity."
5,Great book - particularly about the crusades,"Great book. The first part looks at most of the major myths that exist about Islam - from its supposed invention of the number system to its alleged tolerance, particularly in Andaluzia (Spain). The latter part dealt with the crusades, and what really ignited them. I haven't seen a better account of the crusades ever, even in encyclopedias that addressed the subject at some lengths (try finding out about the Second Crusade in other material). The book also analyzes what Europe's history would have been like had the crusades never happened, as well as some of the things that Crusaders were required to do - that we would as well - before going on their crusade.Note: one doesn't need to be a Christian to appreciate this book. A Muslim isn't likely to like it, given the uncomfortable truths that the book lays bare about Islam."
3,"An Interesting read, but repetitive","This is a good book and spells out clearly the direction of Islam and it's leaders, but spends a lot of time repeating the same material. This could have been a much shorter and more enjoyable read if the author had just made his points and called it a day."
3,Politicaly Incorrect Guide to Islam,Interesting and surprising reading. Easy to read and understand.
4,Ask yourself this.,"After reading this book and seeing alot of negative comments by what are probably followers of Islam and Mohammed I asked myself this question. Was Mohammed a peaceful man that he is made out to be?One only has to look at the battle of Badr, where Mohammed attacked caravans of the Quraysh. He attacked the caravans for the wealth they were escorting, 'This caravan belongs to Quraysh, and will carry much wealth. Attack it; God may present it to you.' The men got ready, some pleased, others apprehensive because they had not thought the messenger of God would make war."" (Kathir, 253)Many Muslims did not want to fight with Mohammed for they possibly believed that their faith was one of peace.Mohammed was known for this type of tactic, so did it happen? Yes. Was he peaceful, hardly, more of a early version of a thug/train robber. Therefore one only needs to fiqure the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree.Read the book, do some research and make up your own mind."
1,All Abrahamic Religions are bad.,"Judaism is bad. Just look at all the killing, mayhem, barbarous activity mentioned...as well as the fantasy (Parting of the Red Sea? LOL). The God of Abraham is depicted as a vindictive prick who enjoys brutally killing those who don't get down on their knees and worship him.Islam is bad. In fact, Islam is hideous. I don't need this book to tell me that, I only need to pick up the Koran and read the first ten pages.Christianity is bad. Christ was good, even wonderful. If we could all follow his simple statement ""Love Thy Neighbor As Thyself"", we'd be living in Paradise. Too bad Christians on the whole do anything but."
1,"Hate-filled ""psycho-talk""","We got this book hoping to get some information about Islam. Instead, the author presents a very biased view of Islam, insisting that Mohammad and all Muslims since then teach and practice violence. The author reminds me of some of the John Birchers of the 1950s, with their negative diatribes against the Jews and communists. According to the author, Muslims have no good in them, they are full of hatred against Christians, and are taught this hatred from an early age. He is particularly anxious that people who see the new film, ""The Kingdom of Heaven,"" should not get the ""wrong idea"" that Muslims could practice a loving, peaceful spiritual life. He even blames the Muslims for the crusades. If you want to get a good inside look at the thinking of some bigoted extremists who believe we are in a war against Islam, you might enjoy this book. If you want to learn about Islam, try another book. Are there ""negative stars?"" If so, two negative stars for this one."
1,The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam,"Very poor book. I was trying to get a serious reading, however I this book is a waste of money. The autor seems to have as objective to create hae against Islam. He shows a distortionate picture of the Islam, showing a lot of hate for Muslims; I am catholic... I am blessed to travel and meet very intresting, open and respectful people who are muslims."
1,Hate some more people...thats all we need,This book reinforces the medias hold on our society...once you have been fed something for so long (in this case that Islam is bad) it is quite easy to belief when people start picking apart pieces...i embraced Islam 1 1/2 years ago and it was the best decision i have ever made...i do not prescribe to some of the most socially damaging behaviours of our time drinking/premarital sex/overindulgence in material possessions/environemenatl damage....Islam has put all these things in perspective for me and has given me a foundation and guidance as to how to achieve these things.....I love all people and respect their beliefs and literature like this CREATES FURTHER DISTANCE BETWEEN HUMANKIND......like we need anymore hate and discrimination....
1,What a nutcase!,"A blatant attempt to make money off of sensationalist fictionalizing. By the way, the Christians invaded during the Crusades, not the Muslims."
3,I confess,"I confess that I did not read this book...yet. I gave it 3 stars so that I did not help or hinder its ratings. I did find one thing interesting about the reviews of this book. Reviewer TW reviewed this book and gave it one star. I clicked on his name to see all his reviews. He did all his reviews on May 9th and gave any ""anti Islam"" book one star and all but one review is EXACTLY the same. Am I supposed to believe anything that TW says. Please....He found several books that he did not like the theme of, did not read them and gave them scathing reviews. Come on...get a grip!"
1,This is Garbage,"I recently had the misfortune to leaf through this book, whose very existence should be an embarassement to our western culture. As someone who has had the chance to study Islamic history in some detail, I was sad to see that this book not only is intentionally inflammatory but riddled with statements that are factually incorrect. It is not so much ""politically incorrect"" but straight out incorrect and misleading."
1,What a garbage,"I would have given this book 0 stars, but 1 is the lowest available. Spencer has a history of writing books that attack Islam, I guess he has nothing better to do. If you want to know about Islam go to the nearest islamic center and ask about it.(...)"
1,Has no clue...,"It always makes me laugh when a non-Muslim writes a book purporting to be the ""authority"" on Islam. Islam is not like any other religion, besides the fact that the entire Qu'ran and Islamic law is written in Arabic, a language the author is completely ignorant on, but it would take years of study to fully understand -- a fact that the author admits he spent a few months ""researching"". My favorite comment from another reviewer sums thi sbook up perfectly...""only in USA such a stupid writer can make money""."
1,Terrible and wrong,"A terrible and misguided publication that has nothing more than incorrect ""facts"" about Islam, Muslims, and the beliefs of Islam. Nothing more than an attempt at spreading hate and misinformation, and does nothing other than fulfill an agenda filled with intolerance, war, and misconception."
1,Sad and divisive,"A book for someone with the emotional maturity of an 8-year-old. This so-called incorrect guide holds back its conspiracy ranting till the second half. There are sufficient facts presented that the book may be worth a tenth of its price, but you may get a headache weeding through the propaganda. Said spin is quite sophisticated, taking the form of debunking the PC opinions that the author says you have. Eventually you will come to understand that the Politically Correct comprise a monumental conspiracy holding - surprise, suprise - any opinion about the subject that the author disagrees with. Ultimately the book is as much about the righteousness of some other religion, but that idea backfires to the point that the underlying message is that all religions are pernicious. The book is divisive, war-mongering, and retro. Whether it is true or not isn't especially relevant simply because the human race will never progress or overcome while our thoughts are guided by children."
4,shades of gray,"This book makes a strong case for Judeo-Christian culture by contrasting it with that of Islam. Islam is the religion of the sword, and always has been. That is an essentially uncontested fact. There is a world-wide effort to obscure and deny the obvious implications of that fact, and Spencer unmasks the deceptions. Unpopular truths are illuminated in the process, and they may make some readers uncomfortable. Those ashamed of their white European ancestry owe it to themselves to see the other side even if they have to hold their noses while reading. If they are honest, they will feel much better when they are done."
5,A Must Read,Spencer presents his case clearly and backs it up with historical references. There are numerous one star ratings for this book which are all critical of Spencer. One thing they all have in common is that NONE of them refutes any specific details from the book. If the book is really inaccurate is it so difficult to provide a few examples?
5,What you need to know,"Robert Spencer is doing all of us an immense service by studying the threat of radical (or not so radical) Islam and writing books like this one. In The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam, he shows how Islam is not the religion of peace and tolerance by quoting from the sources- the Quran and the Hadiths. In doing so he is warning us about the threat to civilization posed by those Muslims who take their scriptures seriously. I do not believe that Spencer could be called ""Islamophobic"" except in the sense that he is afraid of what will likely happed if these people get their way and manage to impose Sharia on the whole world."
4,Insensitive but true,This book is written with little or no sensitivity but the contents of the book are accurate. I just wish the author wrote with a little more love.
4,An eye-opening look at Islam,"This is the second P.I.G. book I've read and it's a keeper. It provides an good history of the religion, Mohammed and the Crusades, and does so without regard for stepping on those with PC toes. In fact, much of this book may really tick off those intent on portraying Islam as a peaceful religion. It provides a much-needed balance to the predominantly pro-Islam message in our mainstream media and frankly, I was hoping it might give me a warmer and fuzzier feeling about the religion and its followers. However, it didn't and that causes me concern.Read this book to learn more about Islam and Muslims, but understand going in that it's not PC. Gee, I guess that's the whole idea!"
4,Very informative....,"A must read for anyone interested in getting down to the nuts and bolts of why radical islam hates ""the unbelievers"" and why they want to establish global shari'a law. Read this book if you are interested in learning about what CNN and many other media outlets simply will not show."
3,"OK, but a little simplistic",I found the pro-Christian bias throughout the book to be very off-putting. Just because Islam has problems does not mean Christianity is good. I would much have preferred this book if it were written from an atheist point of view.
3,A good introduction; a bit over the top,"A brave book, given the tenor of our times. For a serious student of Middle East conflicts, the book is a bit simplistic, and would benefit from a greater appreciation of forces impacting the Islamic world since the beginning of this century.Not all of Islam's woes are attributable to following the literal dictates of the Q'uran. The author relies a bit too much on exposing the often horrorific implementation of Muslim law, or Sharia.Not a bad introduction to the topic, particularly those with right wing views. But to get a wider appreciation of this pressing problem, be sure to read other books, too, such as The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict (2nd Edition)."
2,Good book for the ignorant,"Propaganda at its best..I'm not even muslim but I'm well educated in the subject. This book feeds hate in people who already don't like muslims, or those who are ignorant of the topics. There are bad people in every religion, Islam is no different.. I definitely think the author has his own designs in mind.. Crappy book."
1,intentionally dishonest,"criminally disingenuous in its one-sidedness. examples are cherry picked to boost christianity and bedevil islam. it would be ridiculous, but that people believe the assertions."
1,Great book for sheeple of a right-wing bent.,"Like all of the ""Politically Incorrect"" books, this one preaches to the choir of narrow-minded righty types who aren't interested in actually learning anything new, but rather wish to see their agendas affirmed in writing.Typically of these books, quotes are cherry-picked and taken out of context in order to support a predisposition. Anybody with any intelligence whatsoever can see that this book represents nothing more than the logical fallacy of begging the question."
3,Informative,"The book is informative, although some of the author's conclusions appear to be ""Opinion"" based on selected ""facts"". As a reader I am left with a suspicion that facts contrary to the author's may also be valid.At any rate this is a broad subject that can not be explored in depth in a single book.Overall, met my expectations as an overview of ISLAM.Additional reading needed for the truly curious."
5,A Must Read for Any Brainwashed American,"In the interest of hearing both sides of the Islam story, read this book. You won't get this viewpoint in any media source."
3,Balance is key...,"Whatever your background or beliefs one things is certain do not think this book will give you the answers about Islam and the west, it may for some be a useful starting point, for others it will confirm a bias.I would recommend reading the Koran first and then reading this afterwards, that way you will be able to truly understand and agree/disagree with the arguments contained in this book.Remember one book does not a library make."
5,Politically Incorrect?,"1. There is one god in Islam! 2. mohammad,Jesus, Moses,David (and others) Peace Be Upon Them are messengers of Allah. 3. Islam was spread by the sword? Islam is one of the fastest growing religions in the world, TODAY. 4. Allah is not the God of Muslims only. He is the God of all people and all creation. 5. The Islamic concept of God is that He is loving, merciful, and compassionate. But Islam also teaches that He is just and swift in punishment. Nevertheless, Allah once said to Prophet Muhammad, ""My mercy prevails over my wrath."" Islam teaches a balance between fear and hope, protecting one from both complacency and despair. 6. Muslims neither worship Muhammad nor pray through him. Muslims solely worship the unseen and Omniscient Creator, Allah. and the list goes on and on!"
1,IT IS A GOOD BOOK FOR SELF-DECEPTION,THE BOOK IS FULL OF LIES. IT IS NOT WORTHY TO SPEND YOUR MONEY AND TIME AT ALL.
1,I don't recommend this book!,"If you want to judge Islam, judge it by what is written in Koran, rather than by some author playing with facts. The aim of the author is apparent from the cover of the book."
1,Hilarious,"While reading a brief except from this book, I could not stop laughing. Robert Spencer's claim that the crusades were defensive had me rolling in laughter. The image of the Children's Crusade (during which by the way, many innocent children were sold into slavery under the guise of religion) as somehow defending Europe is ludicrous. Spencer manipulation of the Quran is ridiculous; I wonder is he ever even consulted with a Quranic scholar at any point while writing this book. It is a sad commentary on the people of the United States that a book so ill-researched, so poorly written and so arrogant could somehow make the NYT best seller list."
1,"Seems to make sense, but doesnt have the spine you think it has","To some one looking for answers it may seem that this book has all you need to know about the real Islam. Yet if if you knew anything about the quran and the way that its verses were revealed, you might know better. All verses in the quran were revealed according to different situations in Islam during Muhhammads life. The way these verses are portrayed are made to make them seem to apply to all aspects of life which is completely false. It seems that some people can take verses out of context and people will believe it in its still seemingly corrupt form. I can assure you this book has some true statements from the Quran, but none of which are explained with or given the true meaning and relevant purpose of which a muslim knows god had clearly intended and revealed.You can read this book or take it from a true Muslim, but that is your choice"
1,"Lye, Deception and Fear sells.","People like Spencer continue to earn a buck by creating fear and intimidation through feeding folks deceitful information and lye. We continue to be looking for easy way out and be shortchanged by people like Spencer just because we are too lazy to do the research and understand Islam or any other theology or subject matter ourselves! Feel like spending a few bucks! Instead of buying this book, give to charity and save yourself a few ours to walk the dog in the park."
4,Primer to understanding Islam,"The book is an excellent primer to the Islamic religion and why Muslims are acting the way they are today in the world. It gives you history about Muhammad and compares his teaching with Jesus as well as the history and teachings of the Islamic religion in general.The book is full of citations to the Qur'an to support the author's statements. It is a fancinating book and I could only read about 10 to 15 pages at a time since it made me stop and think about the author's statements and compare them to what is happening in the Middle East and in the Muslim communities around the world.If you know little or nothing about Islam and Muhammad and want some insights into what is happening in the Middle East and the religious violence, this book is an excellent start."
5,"POWERFUL. Great insight, well documented, very disturbing","I like the early chapters where the author goes through common arguments like 'Even in the Old Testament Moses killed off tribes... so how is this different than Islam?' This and many other common arguments are answered and dealt with directly, not with clever phrases, but well thought and very rational answers. A MUST READ! Changes the way you see the news on the main-stream media. Look at the reviews below that rate this less than three stars. They don't even comment on the content and references sited. I was very impressed with how meticulously the author referenced assertions and claims that would understandably upset those that follow Muhammad. No matter what side of the fence you are on before reading this book or listening to the CD version, truth is truth, and this author can't change truth. Do the research and be informed. A fantastic read and listen! AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ FOR THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT THE WESTERN WORLD. Semper Fi."
5,The truth & nothing but the Truth,"Personally I found the information on the Quran and Mohammed nauseating and depressing. I think there should be a sign posted on the front of every Mosque, ""Abandon hope, All Who Enter""! We are dealing with people who's core belief are to subjugate and murder and conquer other Human Beings. Mercy, Forgivness and Meekness is not in their creed. We would do well as a Nation to keep this in mind. To ignore this threat will be the genocide of Civilization. Islam Is a Fascism that has been rampant for a thousand years. A Fascism that began with a small Band of murders and thieves seeking justification for their actions and Spencer backs up all his points with indisputable direct references to the Quran.GR Godin"
4,Great product,Description was accurate and shipment came on time. All pieces were intact without any scratches. I would definitely recommend this product and seller.
4,"Wicked, mad, cool sound track","As a huge fan of the show, I would like to say that this Cd lives up to the quality of the show. While the show doesn't get a huge number of viewers (less than Joan of Arcadia whom pulls in 10 mil. viewers atleast) the Cd should help promote the show.If you watch the show and like the music (or like the band posters that Seth Cohen has on his wall) you should consider buying this Cd. You'll love it."
4,The OC,This is one of the greatest shows to come along in quite awile. It has good acting and story lines and is emotionally envovling. The show also features great music and it is all put together for you on this great disc!enjoy the show and the music!
1,Soul Free entertainment,"This is a great example of the modern pseudo-indie lowest common denominator.It's bubblegum for George W's new world order: designed to keep you snagged on the hooks and lulled into compliance. I won't argue that the artists themselves designed their individual worksspecifically to turn you into an idiot, but taken as a whole package...that's exactly what will happen to you. Resist the Californication lobotomy and buy a BIG STAR album instead."
1,The OC,The OC is a terrible show and is just not cool I am cool not these loosers even the WB version is better then this junk and the music may be worst 1 star territory as the one and only Das Efx would say Wiggity-Wiggity-WackRecomended-OC the rapper now he is tight
5,Awesome Soundtrack,I'm not the biggest The O.C. fan but I love the show soundtrack. It's amazing.It is a nice collection of great songs.My favorite songs from the CD are:- Honey and the Moon- We Used to be Friends- Orange Sky- California- Paint the SilenceIt's a nice mix that even who didn't watched the show will like.
5,Music from the O.C. 1,This has lots of great music from the later season. A good variety with something for everyone. Sounds like the soundtrack to my highschool years.
4,Extremely pleasantly surprised,"I tried out this CD at my friend's urging, expecting it to be completely lame and laughable. However the songs are all incredibly pleasant to listen to, mostly very chill and acoustic, from talented bands that I never would have heard of otherwise! Also, for those hooked on the theme song, the full song IS on the cd... I definitely recommend this CD for those who may not even like the show, it's wonderful to relax to!"
4,Nice one Fox,"I think this soundtrack does justice to the series! Im a huge fan like all the others out there and never miss an episode. However I do think that there certainly could have been more tracks included on this cd or even made into a double cd. For instance; does anyone know what that song was on the episode where Oliver took all the gang to palm springs and he flipped out at ryan. it was heavier than the usual OC standard but man it was so grunty and you could really feel the frustration in the music. Anyone know what it is??SOngs like these would have been beneficial to mix up the soundtrack abit...but nevertheless this soundtrack is a must-have for the hard out fan, or even for those who simply want a good compilation of sounds"
5,Lively and original songs for children.,"Folk-pop singer-songwriter Justin Roberts' Yellow Bus showcases twelve lively and original songs for children. Specifically composed, written and performed so that kids will want to sing along, the songs comprising this highly recommended addition to any personal, school, or community library music shelf include: In The Car; Tickle My Toes; Thought It Was A Monster; Willy Was A Whale; Mama Is Sad; Rocketship; Tie Your Shoe; One Little Cookie; Hey Hippopotamus; Giraffe/Nightingale; All Eyes On You; and the title piece, Yellow Bus."
1,Sorry,"Sorry - recently ordered cd's by Laurie Berkner, Ralph Covert, Jessica Harper and Justin Roberts.Yellow Bus, buy Justin Roberts was a disappointment. Nora's Room by Jessica Harper is the family favorite. Have trouble getting all the way through Yellow Bus."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS RALPH'S WORLD,Roberts songwriting falls flat . We didn't find the songs as appropriate for children as many other children artists. Roberts songs are very bleak and not children friendly. Stick with Wiggles or Ralph's World.
5,great for kids and adults,"We love Justin Roberts - my husband even listens to it sometimes at work! I have to admit I enjoy even more his CD of songs from the Hebrew Scriptures (which Amazon doesn't sell, but you can buy through the artist's website) that's called ""Why not sea monsters?"""
4,Good for dad and daughter,"Bought this for my granddaughter (age4). She likes it.But, the best part is that dad does too. He says it isnice to have kid's music that doesn't drive him crazy!"
3,snoozer,"I never got past the 2nd chapter. If the first chapter doesn't rope me in, the book goes on the used book list."
5,Incredible first novel,"Great intertwined summer read with many suprises for the reader. Interesting acknowledgement of self-love throughout the book. It is very thought provoking and left me wondering if the narrator may have been the author or the ""villian"". Very autobiographical feel to it"
1,"ICK! Unfortunately, really bad...","I wanted to like this book but I just couldn't. The narrative devices the author uses are juvenile, the construct of the book is farcical--by the end I was pulling my hair out I was so frustrated with the writer. To be fair, the start of the book is okay--you become mildly interested in the characters, but the author really runs out of tricks (and any originality or freshness) by about 75 pages in. Considering this book is over 300 pages, you're not in for a fun time. I was sad to see the book devolve so drastically. I wish this book were better!"
2,How is it that Yale + NYC = yawn?,"I read the pre-publication comparisons to Fitzgerald and McInerney and could barely wait to get my hands on ""The Tourists"", but what a dissappointment! The characters aren't so much unsympathetic as unrealized; I didn't care about them, but perhaps that was because none of them seemed at all real. There is also no effective sense of the rich settings of the novel (Yale and New York City); reading this book is like going to New York on business and never getting a moment outside the airport, a taxi and a conference room. Sad, because the possibilities are so great! And the unnamed narrators long, unrequited longing for the ex-Yalie, ex-model, faux-designer Samona is inexplicable with what the writer chooses to reveal about her, and more appropriate to a pre-teen setting than to a bunch of New Yorkers pushing hard at 30. Oy, how I wish I'd gotten this one from the library!"
1,My Labels is getting worse,"I used a previous version of My Labels, and was quite pleased with it. After changing computers a few times, the old version would no longer work with WinXP, so I ""upgraded"" to the newer version. Here's my gripe list:1. When I tried to open my old My Labels files, it kindly offered to convert them to the new format. How convenient! Not at all. The data gets converted (duh), but the label design disappears.2. Entering data is unbelievably frustrating. If you have fields that are the same, you can copy and paste, but that's it. Ctrl-D is supposed to work, but it doesn't really, making you type the same things over and over. Modern software is supposed to increase productivity, isn't it?3. This is really a stamp selling program. They actually only want you to buy stamps, the software only being a hook to bring you in.4. Placement of objects is very clutsy and it's difficult to put things close together.5. Very limited creative options.I'll never buy this again."
5,MYLabels,I have used this label maker before and found it easy to use and was glad to find something I was familiar with.
5,Great gift!,"I gave this as a present, and the gift reciever loved it so much he read it within a week of the gift-giving."
3,Lot's of fun!,"This is a coffee-table collection of pre-production art work for ""The Incredibles."" If you're a big fan of the movie (like me), it's indispensible for your collection...especially if the price is right, like it was when I bought it. You won't get much in the way of the movie-type stills, so it's not for the casual fan or the kids."
3,Not quite the book I thought it would be.,"I thought the book would describe how the artwork the artists made got into the movie. Instead, this book has the conceptual drawings of the characters, buildings etc, some made 10 years before the movie was made. The artists come from the field of flat 2D animation, and with the use of software at Pixar, transformed that into animation with depth. Unfortunately, they only mention this happened, and gave no details or before/after examples. There are no scenes from the movie, only sketches and drawings of characters, the robot, buildings, etc. There is very little explanation about why a character changed over time.I did like the captions showing when a sketch was made and by which artist. Near the end of the book, you could begin to guess who made a drawing without having to read the caption."
3,Not as good as the others,"This is an unusual book. Unlike other ""Art Of"" books, even in the Pixar line, this doesn't show a progression of development, or even have much of a text description of what they're showing. Instead it seems to be the earliest pre-production art, long before they applied the ideas to the digital results.The art is extremely stylised in a very sixties fashion, unfortunately a style I have always found ugly and unpleasant. The colours and shapes are extreme and haphazard. I can see how they apply to the finished film, but that aspect isn't really shown very well in the book.There's too much missing from this book for me to really recommend it unless you're a completist or an Art major who likes that retro era style."
2,"Smart French is a bit too ""Smart""","I certainly would not call this a beginning level CD. It starts right in with advanced level conversations, offering no information on vocabulary or verb conjugations. I've had seven years of French study, but I bought this ""beginning"" level to brush up on my French for an upcoming visit to Provence. The one helpful thing about this program is that it does show you what to listen for in native french speakers. I would definitely not recommend this CD to someone who is a BEGINNER."
2,Pronunciation only,"This product is not bad if all you want to do is learn how to pronounce French more like the French people do. But if you're expecting to actually learn any of the language beyond its conversational pronunciation, you would be much better off buying a different product.The whole package consists of 3 CD's -- a total of seven 1-minute long conversations that are repeated multiple times. You are expected to pick up pronunciation from listening and repeating after you hear each phrase. [...]If you already know French pretty well and just want to learn how to listen/speak more authentically, this would be okay for you."
1,"Boring, teadious and repeatitive...",I was so exited about the course because of amounts of good reviews it has.... However a total disappointment... So boring and repeatitive that I didn't even finish the 3rd lesson!!! They read and explain 5 times for about 10 minutes a 1 minute conversation. For me it was a waste of money. I would not recommend it.
2,How to say French Words,"Maybe I missed something when I ordered this, but I didn't realize they were only going to focus on how to pronounce words. I still listened to all the cd's multiple times, but I haven't increased my knowledge of French in any measurable way."
4,Good start but be sure it's what you're looking for,"I received the wrong CDs at first, but the problem was corrected quickly. I ordered these a few weeks before leaving for France and they were helpful. These are REAL learning French CDs, not just a couple of useful, everyday phrases in French. If you're looking for something like that, you might be better off picking up a basic guide of phrases. But if you're looking to learn the language, these might be better. I'll be using this program for the next few months, we'll see where it goes!"
4,A Great Product.....but not for beginners.,"This is a definite must have product for those who already know some French and are serious about learning the language. I know that there is a beginner CD set but if you know nothing of the French language, you will be lost. This product is best for people who have studied the French language (vocabulary and grammar) and are wanting to learn to understand and participate in conversations with real French people."
5,SmartFrench Audio Cds Beginner - Learn French From Real French People,Reviewer: Nancy (NYC) - See all my reviewsThis is the best way to learn how to speak french on this side of the Atlantic! You will enjoy hearing your own voice pronouncing french words correctly!
2,Disappointed,"I am really an intermediate student rather than beginner, but thought I'd start with the beginner CDs in this series. Like most intermediate students of a language, I need to work on listening comprehension. This program does strive for that, but in my opinion offers too few opportunities to listen to native French speakers. Too repetitious--I kept falling asleep, or having trouble paying attention. Can't believe I bought these CDs! The narrator keeps repeating points he had already made...I won't be bothering with the intermediate or advanced versions.And of course I bought them based on reviews from others, which I consider to be a good indicator...not in this case, though!I have 2 other sets which I consider better (the ""Learn French In Your Car"" is especially good for beginners), and a set from the library that is no longer available."
1,I didn't like it,Poor methodology. I would suggest to continue looking for something better. You will not learn frech with this!
2,not for beginners,"I would not recommend this to someone who hasnt had some French before. I m using it with a friend who hasnt ever studied French and it is very difficult for her to follow along. I, however, took some French in high school and have a basic knowledge and found it quite helpful to be able to learn how French is really spoken on the streets. So, if you re starting from scratch, this is not for you. But, if you just want to polish up and learn some new grammar and some good pronounciation, it s a good buy."
1,smart french,"This was a bit more than I was prepared for, the first conversation turned me off as it was a dialog on smoking, one I felt I would not encounter on my travels. I chose to return it and chose a more generalized course that appeared to be better at teaching me vocabulary with dialogs. Much harder than described for a beginner."
4,Excellent learning too,"I teach a small group of adults French and I've just started using the Smart French Beginner Audio CD set with my students who love it. They all agree that listening to the conversations is an excellent way to increase comprehension and augment vocabulary. We all value listening to native speakers carrying on conversations about everyday topics.I find that including both a slow version and a fast version of each dialoguemakes the Smart French series an excellent tool for teaching and for learning French.Sandy K.Berkeley, CA."
2,Not ideal for the beginner...,"I believe this program is better suited for the intermediate/advanced French student looking to improve his/her pronunciation. Definitely not for the beginner. You are basically listening to and repeating normal French conversations with a little commentary thrown in for good measure. As a beginner, I got more out of the ""Behind the Wheel"" series."
5,Very Helpful,I found the Smart French lessons very helpful. I'm planning on a trip to Montreal and I really need to pronounce French properly. Learning phrases are easy but saying them properly is a different matter. These lessons really helped me to learn to pronounce things I never thought I could pronounce.The people who administer Smart French are also extremely helpful. I needed lists of French to English words and they emailed it to me immediately. I really appreciated their customer service.
2,smartfrench- BEGINNER'S LEVEL,The packaging is inadaquate for the protection of the product during shipping and handling. The stubs that grip the centers of the discs are plastic and crack loose leaving the discs scratched as a consequence of them rattling around over the sharp edges of the plastic stubs.
2,Skip this one...,"I came across this book unexpectedly and bought it with great anticipation after having so enjoyed Robert Littell's novel The Company. While the bar may have been set unreasonably high for The October Circle, I must classify this book as a disappointment. I enjoyed the insight into life in 1960's Bulgaria, but the storyline was too slow to develop and the characters, including the main protagonist, were entirely undesirable. I recommend skipping this one."
4,Good Nutshell,"One of the better written Nutshells. There is a combination of good examples, black letter law, case analysis and quizzes to test comprehension and learning. The authors do a good job of making a complex topic approachable and understandable, and identify a number of common pitfalls and likely exam topics. While I read the 2nd edition, a newer edition is available and would be recommended to the practitioner."
2,Not very useful for exam review,"As acknowledged in the preface, ""this book alone will not present an integrated coverage of the subject."" It just focuses on a few areas and delves into them in great detail, without really providing any sort of overview or anything to help you complete the whole picture. Not the book to go to if you are expexting a comprehensive overview of wills and trusts. I was very disappointed with this nutshell, because isn't that what a nutshell is supposed to be? I would recommend trying to see if another line, such as Examples and Explanations, has a book on the area."
2,YUCK,Book was great but I wish you would have warned me that it came from a smoker's home because I got the book a week ago and still have it outside fanned out trying to get the smoke out of the book. I can't even use it yet because it is so smelly. Other than that the book was great and super fast shipping. Great amazon purchase I just wish I would have known about the smoke. THANK YOU
1,Poor travelling companion,"I should have known once I looked at the first map and Vietnam was mislabelled as ""China"". Poor editing, unreliabale information, inconsistently updated. I chose this guidebook because it was recently published (Feb '03) - MISTAKE! For instance, some prices were up-to-date and some were out by a factor of 5 (if the prices were consistently low it would have been easier). Dates were wrong, telephone numbers quoted had changed in early 1990's, hotel listed were in the wrong towns, maps were difficult to follow. I have travelled with Rough Guides before, so I hope this is an exception, but DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO TRAVEL WITH THIS GUIDEBOOK."
3,2nd editon worse than the 1st one,"While the first edition of this book was very good, the 2nd one was updated by completely omitting one of the 8 major regions of the country (Maluku) just because there was some political trouble there around 1999-2000 (well over by the time this edition actually got published) - it is now worse than theLonely Planetguide which, with all its errors and shortcomings, at least does cover the entire country."
1,NOT GREAT JOBS,"I liked the idea the author had of helping people without a bachelor's degree. Unfortunately, some of the jobs listed are, quite frankly, a JOKE. An actor has the potential to be a great occupation, but what are the odds of every reader becoming Tom Hanks ? (reality)Most likely they will starve waiting for there big break. I also don't consider a ""Taxi Driver"" a fullfillng career. The last time I checked a taxi driver was not one of the most highest paying jobs out there. Which leads me to my most important point. Most of these jobs that are listed here, with a few exceptions, are low paying jobs. Money is not the most imprtant thing in life,but the author seems to beleive that you can become a teacher's aide, make $6.50/hour and live happy !!! Does the author realize that someday I may want to retire, and with a low paying job I can't save that much to retire on.(...)"
3,Baby days? Toddlers days I would say!,I was a bit disappointed by Baby Days. I was looking for ideas and activities for my BABY! I ended up reading more or less 15 of 289 pages since the vast majority of activities are more appropriate for ages 18 months and up. The book is not a loss though. I love the dozen ideas I can do with my under 1 year and a half baby. I will simply need to return to the book as the baby gets older...Parents of older kids will be delighted by the ideas of this book though.
4,great resource,"This book is a great resource if you're looking for ideas of what to do with the toddler set. I run my own family daycare, and with a bunch of little ones running around (plus older ones, so I have a mixed group), it's great to have a go-to book of ideas when the kids need something to do."
5,A great baby present!,"I read this book in a day and have already tried several of Barbara Rowley's ideas. She has very practical and inspirational thoughts on raising a baby and making your home ""kid-friendly"". I loved it!"
2,Difficult to use,"Because the chapters are organized according to time of day rather than age group, I found the book difficult to use. I bought ""Baby Days"" to learn some activities I could do with my 3-month old twins. Most of the ideas are for older children, and I had to search the book rather extensively to find anything appropriate. I will keep the book as a reference to use when my girls are much older."
5,Are you a Native?,This DVD documents on how to trace your Native American background. There are many people in America and worldwide who have Native in their blood but don't realise it. Well this DVD will show you how to find your Native blood. Recommended by anyone who is curious if they have Native blood or not.
2,Tracing Native American Heritage,"This DVD was not very informative. Every aspect of the research revolves around knowing the tribe that your ancestors came from. Most people don't know this information therefore the rest of the program is not very helpful. Personally, I thought it was a waste of my money and time."
4,Book on Native American Heritage,"I haven't had the time to read this book yet. However, it looks like it has some good information in it."
5,i loved this book,"what a wonderful read. i couldn't put it down and after reading it, i immediately lent the book to others who agreed - the author has an authentic new york voice, and her characters are heartbreakingly real. a true achievement. bravo!"
4,Very different!,"Read this book for college reunion book club discussion. It certainly stimulated a good discussion! A very unusual story which kept me anticipating the end. The ending wasn't what I thought it would be.Thought provoking re the culture of the 70's, perspectives of different religions, and the issues faced by a variety of ""loners"".I enjoyed it and would recommend it."
3,"More character development, please.","I hate to say this, but I guess I was pretty disappointed by this book. I really did like the author's style of writing, but I didn't feel as though the main character (Valentine) was very well developed. I didn't understand her motivations or have any inkling of what she was thinking. I don't know if the author did this on purpose, or what.I would like to read more by this author to see if I might like her other work better."
3,Rubbermaid shoe box,"I purchased a variety of shoe boxes from various companies to get some resemblance to organization of my closet. The rubbermaid variety is functional, but the lids didn't stay connected and they aren't attractive at all. Just plain ole plastic shoe boxes."
4,Savage Circus sounds just like old Blind Guardian,"I was not happy with Blind Guardian's Opera album. Maybe that is why Thomen left, to continue to play the kind of music that band is known for. If you like their earlier stuff like Follow the Blind, then this CD is for you. Same paced rhythms, same aggressive guitars and basically the same type of vocals. All just produced so much better. I think this is a good album, doesn't do anything new, just more of the same. If you want to add another old Blind Guardian CD to your collection, run don't walk to get your hands on this. You won't be disappointed. If you were a fan of Night at the Opera, be cautious."
2,Bad Sound Quality/Effect,"Props: Nice and beautiful looking;Cons : bad sound quality;This is very nice looking home theatre than most of current market home theatre systems. Looks beautiful and attractive, outside finishing is ver nice, nicer than my Panasonic system.However the biggest drawback is the sound quality which is the principal functionality for this item.Bass is muffled and blurred, tremble is very unclear and harsh. It could not even match with my existing very cheap home shelf systems .Let along if you compare with Polk system, then it is almost unbearable to have it stayed at home, I returned thme immediately.Only beautiful looking is far not enough for an audio system, Pioneer should pay more attension to sound quality rather than the outlooking appearance, it is waste time purchase for me."
2,disappointing,"This book has excellent pictures and tables, however it lacks in depth and substance. For example, in the atopic dermatitis section, there is no discussion on differential diagnosis/other clinical conditions to consider. The drug allergy chapter has a nice chart for drug desensitization, but the chapter lacks a good discussion on any of the most important drugs...IE the PCN drug section is skimpy at best. And for some reason, they don't even have devoted chapter on food allergy. Overall, I am disappointed with this book. This book is best applicable to medical students and residents. In my opinion, it will not fit the need of Allergy/Asthma/Immunology fellows or practicing staff. I highly recommend ""Pediatric Allergy"" (also from Mosby) which is an excellent resource for Pediatric Allergy. Patterson's Allergic diseases is also good reference."
4,Thank you,This book is easy to use but full of need-to-know items. My son has really enjoyed it. The character lessons are also a great way to talk to my son at a level he understands.Thank you!
3,good,this was very useful.. great way to keep up with schoolwork during the summer sokids dont forget everhything they learned
2,unorganized,I have all of the summer Bridge books. This one disappointed me in the lack of organization and structure. The activities were either way to hard for my soon to be 6th grader or way too easy. It wasn't balanced.
5,Highly recommend,"This is an excellent way to prevent summer droop in academic perseptivity. With about an hour's work each day, the book is taking my daughter through a review and introduction to higher levels of all subjects. She seems to enjoy it."
1,"You're kidding, right?",The price is now up to $14.75 for a 17 oz container. Shipping is TEN DOLLARS AND NINETY CENTS. LOL
1,"Difficult to assemble, cheaply made","Buyer beware! This hamper is not worth the money! I purchased this item to match my baby's nursery and it was the worst mistake I ever made! The hamper came unassembled, so I had to put it together. It took me forever to assemble it because all the pieces wouldn't fit together. You have to put rods into pre-drilled holes. However, the holes were too small and it was tremendously difficult to push those rods into them. I tried to hammer them in, but it still wouldn't go in. Plus, I ended up with hammer marks on the legs of the hamper. What came out was a wobbly hamper with marks all over it.The cloth part of the hamper is also attached to the bottom and top rods. I was hoping to be able to take it out and wash it occasionally, but because I had to jam the rods in the holes, they won't come off now, making it impossible for me to wash the cloth basket.Don't make the mistake I made! Purchase another one for your baby's room!!"
2,"Functional, but very cheaply made","I bought this hamper without seeing the other review. My husband put it together and it is very cheaply made. When he drilled the screws into the rods, they split open. The material is very flimsy and the flap which is supposed to be firm all the way across, was broken. I would not buy another one of these."
4,cute and useful,the assembly for the hamper was easy. it really wasn't rocket science. the two things that was a little off was the way some of the pieces were cut. which made it a little wobbly but if you turn the pieces it evens itself out. the other thing that was wrong with it ... the pre-drilled holes. they didn't always match up so the screwing of the screws into it was a little tough. I suggest a really good screwdriver (or even a drill) all in all a good hamper for the money.
2,Short Lived,"It's a Battery, I know. But in a small travel alarm clock, it lasted only about 4 months. Far from what I expected from a Lithium Battery."
1,"Died almost instantly, Package was open",When the product arrived the package was torn. I didn't think any more of it because the battery worked instantly in the remote controller I installed it in. The battery was useless by the next time I went to use it.
