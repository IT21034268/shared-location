3,Not what I expected,"I got this on recommendation from a friend, but I haven't gotten as much as my friend did from the book."
5,You Can Not Browse Through This Book Without Being Inspired!,"This book has become one of my favorite Italian cookbooks. The photographs are so glorious, you cannot browse through it without running to the kitchen afterwards, inspired to create some tasty dish. As the Italian Food Host @ BellaOnline, I am always looking for inspiration to create new Italian recipes, and this book has lots! I have made over twenty of the recipes so far for family and friends, and every one has been a big hit. This book is well worth the money!"
5,My favorite cookbook!,I love this book. I got it as a Christmas gift and I use it all the time. The photographs are gorgeous and each recipe is illustrated. I like that the recipes are relatively simple and require few ingredients. I also enjoy the descriptions and definitions of terms and regions in Italy.
1,"Remaindered city,four months tops - lower than 1 star -zero.","Positive proof that ordering a book before it's published is really stupid. This isn't the Art of the X-Files, introduced by William Gibson (maybe William Gobson would have been a better influence). It's a bunch of X-files images interspersed with melodramatic ""art"" and groaner explications. ""The creative act takes another aspect when the spectator experiences the phenomenon of transmutation; through the change from inert matter into a work of art, an actual transubstantiation has taken place, and the role of the spectator is to determining the weight of the work on the esthetic scale."" Oh, please. There are also lots of very large images of the title mottos. Do you really need a two-page color spread of the words ""Everything Dies"" (one page, necessarily, is just plain black), or, too appropriately, ""Deceive Inveigle Obfuscate""? Trust no one. I'm waiting for the apology."
5,Sewing 911- I love it!,"I have`t taken any sewing classes since high school. However, I felt I needed to update my knowledge on sewing for practical reasons. This book was perfect for me. With the information in this book, I was even able to repair my black, folding Mushroom Chair! It`s simple, creative, funny, entertaining, user-friendly and practical. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for practical information on sewing dilemmas, starting with the basics."
5,A book ahead it's time,"""Tera, My Journey Home"" covers a wide array of healing and esoteric information. There is an interesting chapter called ""Ama Deus"" Shamanic Healing from the Jungles of Central Brazil, in which Kathleen shares information from what she has been taught and shows how to carry out and use these symbols for healings. There is information on purification, releasing earthbound spirits, bringing in a spiritual guide for self and healing the planet. Symbols for Tera-mai Reiki-Seichem I & II with diagrams. A chapter on the Ancient Art of Hands-on-Healing as it is practised today with case histories. An informative section on iridology and herbs. A chapter about Initiations (all Initiations come from Mother/Father God) and last but not least a short talk on meditation followed by a guided meditation created by Kathleen called ""Journey to Sacred Mountain."""
3,Bigger and Better,"I have recieved the newest version of Tera, My Journey Home, and find it much improved over the first version. While I do not agree with Ms. Milner on all things, she has certainly taken everything she knows and tried to put it in a format for her students and the general reader, that will enhance their use of hands on healing techniques."
4,Project 86 Using Harmony?,"This CD is a good one any good muscisian or Metal fan could respect it. Guitars sound fairly well a little to many effects for an old school metal person like my self. But overall its a good tight sound the drummer makes some unexpected stops and as always his heavy hitting contribution to the band. The singer is actually using harmony NICE!!! ... Ne Wayz GREAT HARMONY I have really enjoyed the harmony in the chouruses. WARNING the cd isn't as METAL or ""Hardecore"" (regarding the fact they are not hardcore) as there last cd. But look at it this way the first cd was a statement a vision this cd is a developement a step foward in to being better muscisians. :-)"
4,The softening of Project86!,"I have their second album ""Drawing Lines"" and I absolutely loved everything about it. I immediately bought this CD when it came out thinking it was going to be better but it was softer. P86 has officially become nu-metal, they are not hard and heavy. I don't know I just wish more of the songs were like Drawing Black Lines. I just barely found out that there is a story going on in the songs. I think I'll go back and find out what the songs are about."
2,Huh?,OK let me tell you that I love Project 86 first. Their self-titled album was good and drawing black lines was freakin awesome. But this album wasn't much good. I hope their next album is more like drawing black lines.
5,PROJECT 86 ROCKS YOUR INSIDES WITH NO MERCY!!,"I CANNOT EXPLAIN THE CALIBER OF THIS CD!! IF THERE WERE 100 STARS TO RATE I'D FILL THEM ALL!! IF YOU WANT LOUD, WAKE-YOUR-NEIGHBORS LYRICS AND BASS, PLUS CRAZY GUITAR SOLOS AND MESSAGE FILLED, BREAK-THE-SUBWOOFER SOUND, look no further!! Project 86 delivers, and delivers in style!! Their sharp, thought-filled messages about the MEDIA WILL KICK YOU IN THE FACE!! Everyone is guilty and sinful, you can hear it from me... OR YOU CAN HEAR IT FROM PROJECT 86!! CDs GET NO BETTER THAN THIS!! YOU'LL BE SURPRISED WITH THE MESSAGE INSIDE!!IT WILL MAKE YOUR HEAD SPIN!!"
2,Big Label Blues,"Well, Atlantic has done it again. P.O.D. went to the label, and Atlantic turned their records into overproduced mediocrities. Now they've done the same thing with Project 86. Prior to coming to Atlantic P86 did Drawing Black Lines, a pleasure of a record that featured a heavy, ferocious sound that managed to also have some vocal hooks and musical catchiness. On Truthless Heroes the sound isn't as heavy, the production is overwrought at times and there are truckloads of vocal melodies and harmonies, a sure sign that Atlantic has sweetened up the P86 sound for mass consumption just as they have with P.O.D. most notably on Satellite. It's ironic, then, that on Truthless Heroes P86 rails against commercialistic forces in society when the band's own music has been compromised for the sake of commercialism. If you ask me, P86 has become what they claim to despise."
4,A very misunderstood album,"This album seems to be very misunderstood by a lot of people. Yes, it is much more of a punk sound, and much more melodic than DBL or the self titled album. But this album was meant to be very cinematic and to tell a story. This is Project 86's complex and imaginative rant on modern society. The lyrics, though quite a bit different, are every bit as thought provoking as anything else the band has released. Yeah, some of the consiparacy theory stuff was a little over the top, and yes, some of the songs sounded similar (as they were meant to carry on a unified theme from beginning to end), but I really do love this album."
5,This Cd Will Blow You Away,Who cares if you are christian or not. This cd is the best. The cd is a 13 song story about a person that grows up in the world. It starts with his childhood and spans out to his death and afterlife. It includes four commercials mixed into the chapters to make it seem like a tv show. Project 86 has always fascinated me with their heavy metal vocals and their look on life.
5,great cd,When I first got this cd i didnt think it was that great. but i listened to it again and i loved it. This band is very skilled at what they do. The vocalist and guitarest is amazing. His voice is so strong and powerful. There are no other words to discribe this cd exept amazing. Little Green men is probably like the coolest song ever. Rock on Jesus.
2,just ok,This cd has like 3 good songs on it and the rest are blah. But I gave them another chance and ordered Drawing black Lines a couple of days ago I havent received it yet but I'll be sure to write a review for it once I have listened to it.
3,Not for me.,"Its kinda just plain. I expected it to be different from other Project 86 but theres just often the same beat and a lot of the same old same old. If thats what you want then buy the cd, but if you really want Project 86 go for the older cds. Just some helpful hints."
5,THIS IS INSANELY GOOD!!,"This by far is Project 86's best album ever! With crazy guitars, awesome beats and powerful lyrics, this band is on its way! If you don't have this cd....BUY IT!!! Songs like little green men, and caught in the middle are AMAZING!! Mixed with a little rap/hardcore, this band meets my standards and anyone elses! BUY THIS TODAY!!!"
4,Nice CD,"I write for a Chilean webzine call kievre, and someone brought to me this cd, and i was impressed to see it because i had the drawing black lines (AWESOME CD!!!) and now i had this, the Truthless heroes cd, the last album from this Christian band.So i put it down in my cd player, and the first time i heard it, it was, way too different from their last album, it sounds lot more melodic rock, like sevendust, or nonpoint, i missed that rapcore stuff that had this great band in the past.anyway, this is a good cd, check 'em out."
3,Drawing Black Lines is still the best!,"I would have to say that I am a tad bit disappointed with Truthless Hereoes that I RUSHED out and bought. It is clearly a heart-felt, angry CD with lots of mixed emotions. There are also a lot of double entendres hidden in the lyrics as well, which is not necesarily a bad thing. It just doesn't have a sound that I can get into, and since I'm not feeling the lyrics either, it, in my opinion, isn't a good CD. It also doesn't help that this album is several levels below the previous album, Drawing Black Lines, which I recommend. It will totally rock your face off."
5,The Best CD I will ever own!,"Truthless Heroes is the best CD ever! My favorite songs are:Little Green Men, Caught In the Middle & Shelter Me* Mercury, but they all are incredible. None were a dissapointment! Project 86 is truly the greatest with this concept album. I'd recommend this if you like music, period.Thanks for Reading,<Vapor>"
3,He was much better with Roy Ayres,"I bought this CD because I heard Zachary Breaux playing extatic guitar on Roy Ayers live CD. Turned out too much of a mixed bag, heavy on an easy listening. Still some pieces very energetic."
3,"Good music, poor product","I bought this a second time because the first one was stolen. This is a stone cold groove, people. If you like jazz, or if you like guitar music, you will love, absolutely love this. I don't know what happened to this artist (and I mean that in the truest sense) but I sure am thirsty for more.One problem: the CD I bought was scratched so badly I couldn't listen to even one song. Talk about frustrated."
5,great artist,All three of his albums are great. Too bad he died when he was only 37. We missed a lot of good music.
1,Bad Shipping,Ordered this metronome to replace my older one of same model that I had for 6 years that finally died :( I love this metronome and would recommend it. In matter of fact I have had 7 friends go out and purchase this exact model!The only COMPLAINT that I have about this product is that I paid for overnight shipping since I needed it for a rehearsal in two days time and it took OVER A WEEK TO ARRIVE. Can't believe I paid three times the amount of regular shipping- TOTAL RIP OFF!!!
1,Warranty?,"This product lasted 14 months for me and had been suitable for my purposes.After 14 months, it just died.The manufacturer has a 2 year warranty and provides no address in the product information; instead it instructs the buyer to contact the ""dealer.""Amazon, from whom I bought this product, refers the buyer to the 3rd party seller who only accepts returns for 90 days. Tried ""googling"" this company's contact information and I got an address in Korea.Metronomes are electronically rather simple and this product should have lasted much longer. This may have been a defective device. However, the product gets one star because of essentially leaving me without a way to use the warranty."
4,Pretty good,"I like that this metronome is fairly loud (there are still times when I'm playing with my piano trio that we can't hear it.) But for personal practice, it's definitely more than adequate. I like the tone of the notes for tuning to. Another small qualm is that the speaker is on the back of the metronome. It's nice to have the temperature and hygrometer, but a friend who has this metronome told me that he has to put new batteries in it all the time. I've had mine for only a month so I haven't experienced that yet."
3,Only if you're realllllly philo-Semetic,"The Bottom Line:A movie in which a 40-year old woman plays an 18-year old boy and a musical in which all the songs sound the same, Yentl succeeds in depicting the world of fin-de-siecle Poland and features a winning performance by Mandy Patinkin, but is less accomplished in its love story; if you really like all things Jewish the movie might appeal to you, but otherwise pass on Yentl.2.5/4"
1,Let's hear it for promoting stereotypes...,"This film has done more to promote ugly anti-Hasidic stereotypes about how we Hasidim supposedly mis-treat women (not!) than anything else I know of in the media market. As REAL Hasidic Jews, both my wife and I found it inane and insulting.The original I.B. Singer story, ""Yentl the Yeshiva Boy,"" was about a female-to-male transgender person who remained living as a man even after the divorce. It was not a third-wave feminist polemic about a woman who eventually went to America to find ""freedom."" (That scene on the boat to America is in neither the original story nor the play.)Streisand's film tells us a whole lot more about about her own agendas than it does about traditional Jews. If you must watch this, at least keep in mind that it is about as stereotyped in its portrayal of Hasidic Jews as ""Tonto"" was about Native Americans."
3,nothing more than okay,"You'll have tons more respect for Streisand after viewing the goodies on the second disk, but this movie was on the whole a disappointment.At least this time it was. I saw it when I was a teenager and found it powerfully affecting at the time. Returning to it as an adult, however, I found my enjoyment stymied since the plot is so far-fetched, the message heavy-handed, and the ending almost a deus ex machina.Still, this movie makes me wish she had helmed more films."
4,Yentl - French release,"I decided to risk the French release and am very happy I did. It is marked Mono on the DVD jacket but the music, songs and effects are in stereo, and listening to it under headphones was a treat ! It is in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio and can be seen in widescreen on a 16/9 TV in either the Zoom, Wide or Smart formats, so until the official DVD is released by B. Streisand, this will do very well."
5,This Is too be released This Year !,"In Yentl one of Streisand's greatest performance is in the production and is to come out in 2005 (no exact date). This movie has everything you need the greatest star , great music , and a great movie line."
5,Yentl Is A Classic!!!! Release On DVD Please!!!!,There are moments in your life you never forget and this is definitely one of them!! Why no release on DVD????? This is crazy when so much crap is out on DVD but not a classic once in a lifetime motion picture like Yentl!!!! Please wake up!!!!!
5,How could anyone give this film anything but 5 stars?,"This is one of my favorite movies. It is a very interesting and moving picture and also very funny in some parts (Anshel's first night of wedded bliss with Hadass comes to mind.) Barbra Streisand was so talented in ""Yentl."" But I think Mandy Patinkin was just as entertaining, maybe more because the character of Avigdor was so multifaceted. They worked so well together. I don't understand how a classic like this is not on DVD? How could anyone give this film anything but 5 stars?"
5,A very impressive directoral debut,"This has to be one of the top 5 Streisand films of all time! Streisand pulls off one of the most impressive directoral debuts that I have ever seen. The film looks as though it was made by a veteran director, and every scene glows with love and care.Streisand recieves great performances from both Mandy Patinkin and Amy Irving, but it is Barbra herself as Yentl/Anshel who steals the show with her moving performance.This is a musical, but it's different in the fact that it is Yentl's internal dialogue and thoughts that are put to music, and most of the time she only sings when she is alone and no one can hear her. The music is wonderful and complements the story extremely well. ""Papa Can You Hear Me?"" and ""A Piece of Sky"" are among the most memorable songs.Just when I thought the movies had lost their ability to touch me comes along this beautiful and uplifting film."
1,I bought this for my wife,"She is a huge Barbara Streisand fan. On the other hand, I am not. But, getting this video is one of those sacrifices you make as a husband. She probably would be annoyed that I gave this such a low review, but it is honestly how I feel about the movie. When it first came out in the theaters I went with my wife to see it and I totally fell asleep. The only other time I had ever fallen asleep in a theater was when we went to see Reds (Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton). Anyway, if you're a Streisand fan nothing I could say would convince you that this is anything other than one of her major contributions to civilization."
5,NEED this on DVD!,This movie DESERVES to be on DVD! I watch this movie at least twice a year. My VHS copy is worn out and I therefore want to move up to a DVD. I will not buy another VHS.
5,"Yental the ""Movie""","Great movie, timeless and the singing is so moving. This is a movie to keep for all time. To think she did everything to get this movie made just shows you a woman can do anything. Go Barbra!"
5,Yentl(Two-Disc Director's Cut) DVD,I waited for a very long time for this movie to be out on DVD. I love Barbra Streisand and this movie. You will not be disappointed in this purchase. I loved the insight into why things were done in the movie. Great behind the scenes information. I loved it all. The music is so beautiful. It is fantastic and I would highly recommend it. I will watch it over and over again. Yentl is a work of love.
1,"wrong disc, two times in a row","I saw this movie ""Yentyl"" and loved it so I wanted to get the soundtrack from the movie ""Yentyl"". I ordered it and along comes the MOVIE, but NOT the soundtrack. I emailed you my complaint and the immediately issued a return address label and said they would send me the SOUNDTRACK right away. The next shipment I got was the same MOVIE as they sent the first time, so I complained again. This time I got a longer email from someone who even provided me the hyperlink to the SOUNDTRACK to ""Yentyl"". Then I went to the hyperlink and bought the SOUNDTRACK that I wanted on the first time. I was somewhat disappointed that it took three times to send me my correct order. Every other time I have ordered from Amazon, there was NO PROBLEM and I was extremely satisfied.I was dissatisfied that I received the WRONG order two times in a row."
1,Would have been great two years ago...,"For what is arguably the best musical made in the last 25 years, it's a crime this was brought out like this and not released simultaneously on blu-ray.As most of us know, the real power of blu-ray is the soundtrack, and this is one that definitely deserves uncompressed sound. Quite honestly, I have NO idea what they were thinking about in releasing this now (two years ago, before BD won the war, this might have been welcomed).As it is I would recommend that most folks stay well away from this in the hopes it will encourage La Belle Streisand to make this the first BD release of her many wonderful films. We've waited this long, might as well wait until it's done right."
4,Yentl Movie,The quality of the film was a little scratchy in parts but otherwise very good. I am not sure about the extended cut since we didn't watch the original cut.
5,FINALLY!!!,"FINALLY! The 2 DVD Director's Cut for the movie Yentl will be released... I've been waiting for a long time for this movie to be released. I fell head over heels for this movie the very first moment I saw it. I would recommend it to ANYONE (actually, I've already recommended it to friends). Unfortunately, it's not shown on television very often; but, it doesn't matter anymore. I'll soon have my own copy. It is definitely a classic. I can't wait to receive it."
2,Beautiful Movie - horrible Europe-DVD,"Don't be to sad, when ""Yentl"" will be published in Europe in July. Why not to be sad? First reason: Sound in 1.0 MONO (!!), second reason: Picture in 4:3 - no widescreen, reason three: no Bonus, no Extras ... nothing!And that's the worth of this DVD: Nothing: To publish a Movie on DVD, which called itself ""A Film with Music"" in Mono is a shame. To use the format 4:3 for a Movie (not a TV-Series) is a shame too! Shame on MGM for this publication which I will not buy, BECAUSE I adore ""Yentl"". This beautiful movie with so much beautiful Music deserves much, much more than this."
4,Barbra Streisand's Dream Movie,"You may love her or hate but the truth should be admitted - Streisand is an extremely talented artist. ""Yentl' is her baby of directing, producing, co-writing and starring as a girl who wants to study and become a rabbi and who has to disguise herself as a boy to be accepted in a college. Streisand had fought the studio for 15 years to get it made, and she put her heart into this. Barbra is a gifted director, and the film is beautifully shot. I liked her acting - I thought she was convincing and touching when her character started to fall in love with a fellow student (very appealing Mandy Patinkin, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father: prepare to die"" of ""The Princess Bride"") and had to hide her feelings. I also like her singing and I think that the songs belong to the film and can not be taken out of the context."
1,Yentl VHS,I got the VHS in the allotted amount of time but the tape was not connected to the reel. It just keep ejecting from the machine. My husband had to pull it all apart and reattach it. It apparently had not be checked for damage before being sold.
2,Isaac Bashevis Singer Trivialized,"It would take quite an achievement to turn Singer's mavelous writing into something more or less like a Lifetime Network made for TV special. The beauty and sensitivity of his writing and characterizations winds up lost in a vortex of Babs' narcissism and the result is close to sacrilegious. One can clearly see the level of Streisand's abilities in the conversion of such a timeless literary masterpiece into a pure exercise in kitsch and cliche, while perpetually playing ""mirror, mirror on the wall...."" Judging from the reactions often on Amy Irving's and Mandy Patinkin's faces, they were both perceptive enough to know it, but classy enough not to come out and say so. If abasement of the wonderful culture of the prewar Eastern European shtetls is a major avocation, this one is not to be missed and ranks up there with Jerry Lewis' magisterial The Day the Clown Cried."
3,Yentl 2 DVD Director's Cut,The DVD's arrived in great condition but I was expecting more bonus features from Barbra. I didn't like the editors markings throughout the deleted scenes. It made the DVD look cheap. Otherwise the quality of the picture itself was fine.
1,Very disapointing...,"I Love this movie and was heartbroken when I found that I spent all this money on a ""Two-Disk"" Directors cut which came as only the one disk of commentary alone. I couldn't even watch the movie I thought I just bought. Very DISSATISFIED! I also have to go through a extraneous process just to return the darn thing. Do NOT Buy this product."
2,Yentl dvd didn't work on both discs,Yentl dvd only worked on one of the discs; already sent it as a gift.
1,I have not received this product yet,I cannot say anything about the quality of the product as I have not received it from the sender yet.
2,Could not watch it as the streaming video would not work properly,"It looked like it might have been a fine film to watch, but I gave up after 30 minutes of trying to get the streaming video to work."
5,This movie will make you cry!,"I love this movie. It is about a Jewish girl who just wants to learn about the scriptures, so she dresses up as a boy and goes to school. It is sort of a ""Twelfth Night"" type of theme when she pretends to be her brother and falls in love with a schoolmate who thinks she is a boy. The one she falls in love with is in love with another woman who is in love with her (because that woman thinks Streisand's character is a boy). This is similar to Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. There are a lot of movies out there with this theme, like ""She's the Man"".Anyway, the man who plays the man she loves (Mandy Patankin) also plays Inigo Montoya in Princess Bride. He's an excellent actor!!!"
5,great service. finally out on dvd after 25 years!,I've looked for this on dvd for the past few years and was only able to find it on vhs until now.
4,EXCELLENT FIRST TRY AT DIRECTING...,"Barbra Streisand does an amazingly good job at directing this simple but enthralling story -- of course, she is too old to play Yentl, but you go with it anyway. And the score, which remains lush and captivating, does not quite fit, though again, it is easy to let it sweep you away. On its own terms, as a series of musical videos, the movie is near-brilliant -- the camera intoxicatingly swirls in time to the music, and bends around each tree and door frame with a knowing sense of surprise. There is an inherent sense of choreography in the camera work of this film, which comes from Barbra's obvious musical sensibilities. Amy Irving enchants and Mandy Pantinkin heats up the screen with a powerful and energetic performance. The ending, with its bow to Funny Girl, is way way way over the top -- you almost expect immigrant Yentl to take off in flight herself -- but then again, it works."
1,Fleischer's Superman/Lost Episodes,"First of all, l was less than pleased with this DVD set, and also the one that preceeded it. The sound has modern sound effects dubbed over the original sound track (why? the original sound effects are fine) and the original sound track has been messed up to sound ""tinny"" and like it's coming out of a tunnel! Image Entertainment has also released a DVD set with all 17 cartoons on one set. I originally bought the laser disc version of this release, some time ago. On the laser disc, picture and sound where fine, except they had the opening title only on the first short, with the end title, only on the last short. Someone elses review on the dvd version said the quality was not good, well then l would have to say to collectors, do not buy either of these dvd releases. You are better off with the laser disc set, or the vhs tapes, which are all better quality, and no tampering with the sound on those!"
3,Okay; kept me turning the pages but left me unsatisfied,"As other reviews have stated, this book is basically two novellas very loosely tied together by an aging legendary photographer and the influence he has had on the central character's life and work. It was good for a bit of escapist reading, but left me wanting something meatier."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this latest David Morrell effort. I have read all his books and thoroughly enjoyed them, but this one left me wondering why I even finished it. The ""hero"" is a shallow, uninteresting man and solutions seem to just fall in his lap -- or bed, as the case may be. The ""sex goddess"" that he dumps his girlfriend (who, by the way, nursed him back to health in the beginning of the book) for is a business tycoon who apparently can't function without him after their first meeting. Lines like: ""I'm afraid to sleep alone."" and ""I've never experienced anything like . . ."" are straight out of a daytime soap opera. My conclusion: Don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,"poorly crafted ""double story""","David Morrell is one of my favorite action authors. Usually a great story teller. But, Double Image is poorly crafted with one story and one buried short story that doesn't fit well into the novel. I was very disappointed!"
2,One of Morrel's Worst...,"Unfortunately, the Booklist review is quite accurate and Double Image is comprised of two stories that are poorly integrated. Additionally, the character development is weak and character motivations seem ""out-of-character"" and contrived. On several occasions I was tempted to disspose of the novel. Though, with morbid fascination, I continued reading to uncover how many more irrelevant and unrelated plot twists Morrel was going to throw in. The story itself is worthy of a 1 ranking, while following the mistakes of a prominant writer (Morrel) earns a 5, thus averaging a 3 overall. It was a very dissapointing read in light of Morrel's previous efforts. Also, it's always a shame to give away ~$20 for a book that doesn't entertain."
5,Hitchcockian intrigue,"I think it's great that David Morrell is exploring more avenues of fiction, though I still believe that fast paced novels are what he excels at. I think that readers who did not enjoy the book should reread it and see what Morrell was trying to accomplish. This novel is not a hunter-hunted novel, but is a novel that explores the fearfully dark corridors of the human mind."
2,"Readable, but",A recent convert to Morrell I bought this book in eager anticipation to be left disappointed. Two distinct story lines that I felt never linked sucessfully left me with lasting impression that the book could have worked but did not.
3,"Give the man a break, people!","All right. So the book was disappointing to a lot of you. A clunker. You want every book to be his best? If you liked his last 5 books, why do you want your money back? Take a few deep breaths, relax, and wait for Morrell's next book. Now, if that one's bad too, I say we go over to his house and water his bushes. But first we wait...bide our time..."
2,Uh-oh,"I love David Morrell, I have read everyone of his books. The action, the characters, the spy habits. But this is not like his other books. Does David Morrell question his desire to write spy novels anymore? This book is not what I was expected at all! It totally lacked Morrell's famous tension. Foremost, I was disappointed with the trashy themes, I had to skip ahead several times because it got so graphic. Is he going through a mid-life crisis? Well get over it, love your wife, and go back to writing exciting action novels."
3,ordinary,"David Morrell has a tendency to roller-coaster the successes and non-successes of his books. Some are great and some are bad. It's hard to maintain a consistency in greatness and should he be able to do so, then I can stop believing in God.I finished the book in one day. Not because the book was overly exciting, but both stories were short enough to read quickly. For the effort that I put in to finish the 500 or so pages, I did not feel ""gyped"" for the money I paid for the book. I just felt that the stories were too short to develop the characters well. I think that this contributed to the ""floppiness"" of the book as seen by the other readers. I liked it. But not as much as THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROSE ""series"" and Rambo.I'll look forward to his next book."
1,Thoroughly disgusting!,"Coletrane, the main character in Double Image, is as annoying a character as is conceivable. During the majority of events in this book, he usually is found whining, being scared, and thinking almost exclusively about himself and only himself; for example, he deserts the woman who put her life in danger for him and barely thought twice about it. The course of this book is saddeningly predictable. In addition, it seems to be about 4 books all crammed into one...first, a terrorist stalker, then suddenly, a mysterious picture of a woman, then next, a vixen with 60 boyfriends and a thing against men. And throughout the entire book, the inconsistencies in plot and minor details all add up to a completely unpleasurable reading experience. Buy this book only if you'd like a good laugh at idiocy."
3,Not up to Morrell's usual standard,"Pace, character, plot, everything was less than I have come to expect from Morrell and I have read them all. One nagging nit to pick. Much of the technical photography details were just wrong. Then the author defined ""circles of confusion"" almost completely backwards, and went on to use the photographic term metaphorically in several places. This led me to have questions in the back of my mind about the accuracy of details in his previous books.An interesting read and I probably would have been happy with it as a first novel. But not at this stage from David Morrell."
1,A terribly dull and stupid novel.,"I was looking for a light entertaining read when I picked up this book. Many quotes from critics praising this novel and its author, David Morrell were provided . I found it to be stupid and unbelievable. Because it is so far out, the many action sequences turn out to be dull. It is really a rough patching together of 2 novels. In the first, the prime minister of Bosnia is chasing our hero around LA trying to murder him, his family and all his freinds. In the second novel our hero gets mixed up with the most beautiful woman in the world, She is also rich and exudes (would you believe) static electricity. He gives up his girl to go to mexico with the goddess. She turns out to be a diobolical serial killer. After he puts her away his girlfreind (would you believe) returns to him. I wondered how such poor writing gets published. Then I found out Morrell wrote the Rambo series. If I had known that I wouldn't have read the book in the first place."
5,action plus,Great book. Both sections full of action and suspense. Love Morrell's books! Especially love a book I can't put down as these are hard to find.
2,Good effort falls short,"This book left me going, ""Huh?"" Basically it is two seperate plot lines very loosely tied together. One of them ends partway through and is not at all plausible (I'm sure foreign militants leave their country and stalk photographers that caught them in the act all the time--I've just never heard of it). Too much graphic sex and violence with not enough story to back it up. It doesn't work, and I'm not sure the war crimes-stalking thing would have worked anyway.. it's way too bizarre. The other plot line was okay, and with some more fleshing out, could easily be a book of its own. I do see what he was trying to do with this, but I, personally, found it convoluted rather than complementary."
2,Below par for the great author,"Admittedly it has been some time since I poured through this latest offering from David Morrell, but I'll throw in my two cents anyway. Of all the Morrell I have read this was my least favorite. I didn't connect with the motivations of the main character at all, and the storyline was way beyond belief from someone who generally skirts this line thin but successfully."
5,The Red Tent,"This book really brought the biblical characters to life!! It was facinating to read about how life would have been for Joseph's sister. I cried a few times- both happy and sad tears!I wish that the author would write more books in this historical/non-fiction - fiction mix!! I would love to learn more about the people written about in the bible and this is a much more interesting way to do it then just reading the bible. But one does need to remember that it is a mix of fiction and non-fiction and not to take it all as ""gospel"". Hope that you enjoy it as much as I did."
5,splendid!,"THE RED TENT is absolutely splendid! I have recommended it to all of my friends and then some! I simply could not put it down. From the very first words to the last, the story of Dinah and her mothers is nothing less than incredible. Though NOT a religous book, it is very spiritual and uplifting. This is one story that should remind all women of the marvels and gifts of womanhood. Enjoy!"
3,"Flawed, yet still a fascinating read","The Red Tent opens up a world, and that is what makes it so compelling. It personalizes and humanizes the matriarchs and patriarchs (perhaps too much for some). The details are rich, and it is unlike anything else I have read. Detracting from this though is the writing style, which in many places veers towards the cliche and the sentimental. The characters and the physical descriptions are stock as well. The voice in many places is so modern (and has overtones of 90's pop psychology) that it strains credulity. Yet I kept reading and reading and didn't want to put it down. So depsite these flaws, there is enough wonderful in it to keep you going. If you liked this, I would also recommend The Ladies Auxiliary, by Tova Mirvis, and Mazel, by Rebecca Goldstein, both of which use traditional Jewish stories and retell them, as Diament did here."
1,It doesn't sharpen,I think I need to return it because it does not sharpen my knives. It is difficult to use and my husband has tried multiple times and they just don't feel sharp to me. I think I will go the professional route instead.
4,Completely original,"The name of the band, CD title and the cover picture, which appears to a prostitute taking a drag on a cigarette in front of a juke joint, suggest this is not going to be a highly polished, easy listening CD. And South Filthy is the kind of band you might find stumbling into some small, gritty bar someplace in the middle of nowhere, which is the beauty of this CD. And the music turns out not to be anywhere near as raunchy as outward appearances.You're not going to be blown away by any of the musicians, singing, or songwriting. What blew me away was the joy of the songs, which have no interest in following any normal conventions of traditional blues/country/bar band rock and most importantly, commercialism. The songs, done so earnestly, if not spectacularly, are largely original.I doubt you've ever heard anything like it, and probably never will again."
3,About the leap on 'Leap',"The book is inspiring and well written with examples that are diverse, didactic, and illustrative. 'Leap' has its momentst force you to think twice your regular way of doing business. And here comes the 'but'. You do get the sneaking suspicion that you've heard one or two of those ideas and examples somewhere before, or that you've heard the same 'tune' before... maybe it is that advertising and business books have lost their 'Leap' factor or may be it is time to leap for another refreshing book genre!!"
2,One man's view,"The value of this book comes more from the entertaining story-like approach, rather than the business value. This is your book if you are looking for ideas/phrases like: the end of advertising; revolution in creative business strategy; left brain meets right brain; brand and company DNA; we face new times that require new tools.The lack of research behind it makes this book more a local man's tale and a long opinion, which in turn causes the book to fall into repetitive ad and business jargon clichés. Probably the common mistake of many successful-business-man-turned-author.My recommendation: approach this book with a great deal of business skepticism, but with a great sprit of enjoying a good story (especially if you are part of the madison ave crowd)."
3,Leap! A Revolution in Creative Business Strategy,"Book came in a timely manner, however; was not forewarned about the writing and the highlighting throughout the book. Had I known, I would not have ordered it, I find it very distracting."
2,Used as a sales tool ... to his own staff,"As a former employee of the EuroRSCG empire, one of the most common things we heard from the top brass was, ""hey theres a new book out by bob, go buy out"" I swear we got that once a week. I did read the book, found it interesting, and would have given it a better rating if i wasnt sick of the sight, and name of it.Good ideas and the CBI concept would work, if we actually used it, which we never did. Twaddle + (Internal & External) Book Promotion = One Rich Bob S."
1,WHERE IS MY VIDEO?,"I have not received the video, I'm lost as to what to do? I sent you an e-mail and received the below message:Dear MARY BROWER,We are sorry to let you know that your email(s) below cannot be delivered. The recipients have decided to leave the Amazon.com platform or are not eligible to receive any further email communications.(Krisriddy6)Can you help me, or can you at least send me their phone number, this has been very upsetting, I wanted the video for my granddaughter's Christmas.I have used Amazon several times, never had a problem until now, but it seems like you do not want to become involved. I can be reached at 310-851-7249. Thank you!"
1,"Look out, another TJ Roberts masterpiece of horror.","If you don't already know the "" 'Kid' in Title Rule"", you just might deserve to watch this movie. But in order to be nice and to contribute to the general good of society, let me explain it to you: If a movie has the word ""kid"" in the title, it is a must-miss. More specifically, if the title starts off with ""the"" and is followed by an adjective or a noun that seperates the kid of the title from other kids, it is subject to the "" 'Kid' in Title Rule."" Examples are ""The Skateboard Kid"" or ""The Invisible Kid"" or ""The Dirtbike Kid."" Anyhow, ""The Magic Kid"" follows this rule to a tee. It can be very dangerous to the alone and unaware viewer. The acting of course is terrible, but TJ Roberts adds a special degree of hateability to a movie that's bad enough as it is. You were warned!P.S. I might be wrong, but I think that this is TJ's movie debut. What a tragedy, that Hollywood unleashed Roberts into our homes. END"
5,A black belt visits his uncle in California Who Owes a mob,I want to know t.j Roberts e mail addres so he can know how big a fan i am because im a MAGIC KID too
5,best single by a young band in '99,"Speechless hits the chart! And makes this a must buy in '99. Along with Neve, 2 top bands this year. much better than Keanu Reeve's band, which is their goal. Remind me a lot of Our Lady Peace the way they have beckoned with popularity and being so confident at this young of age. A great buy."
5,the mysterious mr.borges,"dr.christ has written the single best explication of borges i have come across to date .he is a fine scholar whose style is accessible to all readers.borges is not an easy writer to comprehend,but after reading christ's book i understand him far better than before.i highly recommendTHE NARROW ACT.DR.JAMES F.MULLAN"
5,A good book if you want to design Your own hats,"I have attended evening-classes in millinery, and it was obvius to me that the writer is an experienced teacher. The book focuses mainly on how to make hats of ones own design. You are instructed how to construct your own patterns and how to make the patterns into hats. Most techniques were familliar to me from the evening-classes, some were variations. If You have some experience of sewing or millinery and wish to transform your dreamhat into reality I recomend this book to you."
5,awesome hat making book,as a professional designer/sewer over 30 yrs. had a hankering to look into hat making. this book is awesome!!! great pictures and instructions and hints. highly recommend it to serious sewers. not for novices or beginner sewers.
4,makes great coffee,"THis is a great french press that makes great coffee. I am a huge cream and sugar fan and can drink this coffee with no sugar and very little cream. You may need to grind your own to get the right size ground. The only problem with this is that even when you use very hot water (not supposed to use boiling) and preheat the pot, the coffee does not stay hot long at all. I do like the double walled stainless steel but still, it does not keep the coffee hot. Great if several people have a cup and then you make a new pot and it is not sitting there cooling. Be prepared to scoop all the grounds out with a spoon or your hand when it is time to wash it. All in all, a great cup of mild yet strong coffee."
5,Great press/carafe combo,"No more having my brew cool before I am able to drink it. The seal is fairly tight, rarely to grounds get past it. If you've never had pressed coffee you're missing a real treat.Some tips:Grind to a course grind and always use the recommended amount of coffee/water ratio. Using fewer beans can result in bitter coffee.Pour hot - not boiling - water into the carafe THEN put the grinds in. Stir a bit then put the lid on. I let mine sit for 3.5 minutes before pressing."
3,It's good....but worth it?.....not so sure,"This is a very good press, there's no doubt about it. But, does it live up to it's price tag? Not really. This is one of the largest coffee presses I've seen, so I was excited to get it. One of the main reasons I purchased THIS press was the fact that it was a Thermal press. But, when I received the pot, it really didn't impress me....The Thermal feature really didn't work. Bodum says the coffee will stay hot for up to 2 hours....but after less than an hour, the coffee was barely warm, and once I added cream, the coffee lost all its warmth!So, it was hard to justify paying $70 for a 'Thermal' coffee press which doesn't really keep the coffee any warmer than a glass pot that costs less than half the price!So, if you want something that looks nice, and brews good coffee, and money is no object, then go for it....But if you just want a pot that brews quality coffee, I'd recommend going with a less expensive model."
2,Good for awhile,"We received the press as a wedding present, and I used it regularly for loose leaf tea. It worked really well until a couple of months ago when the shoulder nut came loose when I pulled the plunger out and the mesh stayed stuck to the bottom of the carafe. I tried to pry it out to no avail. I e-mailed Bodum asking if there was a solution to getting the mesh unstuck from the bottom, but never received a reply. For such an expensive item, I think a quick e-mail is in order.While the carafe functions well in keeping tea warm and no leaves ever got out, I'm disappointed in the quality and in Bodum's customer service."
5,It works great!,Tired of crafs that are glass and break easily. This is sturdy and holds more coffee. Now we get two cups of coffee each instead of one.
2,Bodum Columbia Thermal 51 oz Stainless Steel Coffee Press,So far I have not had good coffee in this press. I am still trying to get the right amount of grounds. It does not keep the coffee hot like I had expected.
4,good cup of coffee!,"After ditching the Cuisinart drip maker with the grinder, my husband and I decided to go back to basics. First we did a percolator, which made a great cup, but did not last (see http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A5GDSXJ5WCIA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm). We went back to our 4-cup french press and had forgotten what a GREAT cup of coffee it made. This was a natural progression, since it holds more and keeps the coffee hot longer. My only two complaints are the price (ouch!) and that the coffee really only stays HOT for about 30 minutes. After two hours, you have a lukewarm cup. Still love it and am sure I will NEVER go back to drip!"
5,Very Pleased,"This is much sturdier than my circa 1994 Bodum single serving glass carafe. I can make 4-8 large mugs worth of coffee. I still default to my old glass carafe when making coffee for just myself. The straining mechanism (on the new one) is much sturdier and easier to clean than the screw-apart one that came with the glass carafe.The two great points:1) Capacity2) Keeps coffee warmer than a glass carafe does**The only drawback is the shiny outer surface of the carafe. Mine has already gotten scratched! Water spots show easily too, so if it's out on display like mine, you may feel compelled to polish it often. I wish Bodum made one with a ""brushed stainless steel"" exterior to solve this problem."
5,"Attractive, sturdy, easy to clean, makes great coffee","Three years ago my husband and I bought a small French press and used it once. I thought the coffee was pretty good but not worth the hassle, and put the press away. A few months ago I pulled it out again for fun and this time we got hooked. However, it consisted of a glass beaker with a separate metal casing/handle -- a pain to clean and I was worried about breaking it. A few weeks ago I ordered this stainless one and I couldn't be happier. It makes great coffee, looks great on the counter, is practically indestructible, and is easier to clean than the old one. I ordered this size so we'd have enough when guests come over, but I think we'll get a smaller one for the two of us because this one is a bit unwieldy for daily use if you usually only drink one cup each. (You aren't supposed to make extra and let it sit in the press because it will get too strong.)"
5,OH MY GOD!!,"Well if you like good coffee or tea this is the way to go. I have a few french presses and this is by farrrrrrrr the best I have used and I did a lot of looking before buying this one. No worry of breakage, coffee stays hot much much better than the glass ones and the clean design looks great on you counter, I constantly have people ask about it. I could not be happier."
4,Great tasting coffee.....but,"Everything you've read about the great tasting coffee is true. The reason I gave it four stars: The pot has no markers on the inside indicating the amount of water needed. I fill 3 mugs with water and then pour it into my kettle and heat it. Then I grind the coffee which always leaves a mess. When the kettle whistles I add the ground beans and musn't forget to set the timer for seven minutes. After enjoying the delicious coffee and, it truly is, you have a mess of coffee grounds to scoop out with your hand. It's a lot of steps when my previous pot did the grinding and brewing without much attention. Is the extra work worth it? I'm still undecided. I wish some of these issues had been addressed by the reviewers."
5,Great product!,"Since my regular drip coffee maker broke, I decided on an alternative with the Bodum Columbia Thermal. The thermal function really works! I have been able to enjoy hot coffee throughout the morning, without that burnt taste from a regular drip coffee maker. The pour spout is designed with good dynamics and does not promote spillage. I love the way it looks, and I especially love the way it makes delicious, rich, creamy coffee! Just make sure to use dark roasts, as light blends come out too weak."
5,Used every day for the last year,"This makes GREAT coffee. I agree that is it not piping hot after one hour, but we usually each have two cups max within half-hour so a non-issue. Big advantage is the size of the press, which is perfect when we have company. We even take it on family vacations!"
3,filter,"easy to clean, great coffee... until the silicone on the filter shrinks. then expect to sieve a lot of coffee grounds.the only place to get this filter is from the bodum website."
3,Nice! But tastes like rubber if it sits...,"Just like every review; I will also say nothing beats a coffee press! I used to have a glass, 8-cup press which I had for 2 years and just loved it. The glass broke, and instead of replacing it, I seen this (non-breakable) stainless, insulated, 12 cup unit (I love coffee). I made my first pot and just like the glass press, it tasted fantastic the first round. The second round; it had the smell and taste of the rubber gasket around the screen (and yes I washed it thoroughly). I sure hope this issue subsides with usage. I would have preferred if they stuck to spring gasket (like the glass pot). Perhaps the metal on metal prohibited this design. All-in-all, I wish I just replaced the decanter."
2,Returned for good reason,"I usually just read reviews and use them to make my purchase decisions. I actually did the same with the Bodum Columbia 12 cup press. That's why I'm writing this. This product has recieved many positive reviews and I felt compelled to buy it. I have to say that I was not a great product for me. It simply does not keep the coffee hot very long (I even pre-warmed the carafe with very hot water). Now...I like my coffee hot. So, if just warm is OK with you, maybe this is not an issue. I found that the lid did not fit very tight. Maybe that was the problem. Anyway, I returned it and found a BonJour thermal coffee press a TJ Maxx for $24.99 which is smaller (1 liter or 33.8 oz., called 8 cup) but actually keeps the coffee hot for well over an hour. It's a little small for 2 people but I like it better because it's vacuum insulated. I can always make another pot if we want more. BTY, the coffee tastes really good out of both presses."
3,kind of disappointed,"I've been using a Melior since the 70s. When Frieling came out with an insulated, stainless version I grabbed it for obvious reasons. First the plunger knob broke off. My husband made new threads and put a different cap on. Then the handle came loose. Another fix. Didn't last. I still use it, but with a swinging handle. So, I next tried this Bodum. My only big issue with it is the sloppy pour. I have the largest version and the filter is so large that it tilts, allowing grinds to come through. And there is no way to tip out the coffee so it doesn't dribble down the pot. Not perfect, but serviceable. I'm not in love with the aesthetics. The large pot is ungainly. Tries to be elegant, but misses."
3,Little disappointed,"The coffee from this pot was amazing. The only downside to me is that it did not keep it as hot as I would have liked. By the second cup I felt I needed to heat the coffee up more. I put hot water in the pot to preheat it and used my warmest large tea cosy to keep the heat in, and the coffee still did not even stay as warm as tea does in my Brown Betty teapot. The best solution for me was to prolong the heat by drinking out of a thermal cup so that the heat the coffee did have was retained as long as possible. Those who really have to have their coffee hot may be disappointed. I am returning mine."
3,Bodum should have left out the plastic parts.,I love Bodum press pots. Unfortunately this model has a plastic gasket/screen combination seriously reducing the overall quality of the product. I wrote the company to no avail then found a friend with a set of the old 3 part stainless steel screen/gasket (from a broken glass press pot) replaced it and threw away the plastic one (sorry landfill). Now I am much happier but still a little miffed that they would make a beautiful stainless steel pot and put plastic parts inside. If I had know before hand I would have looked for a different model that didn't use any flavor destroying plastic parts.
5,Great watch at a bargain price....,This is a great watch for the price! I needed a watch for when I get dressed up....which isn't too often so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've been very happy with this watch.
2,Not Good,"I used this for a couple of weeks, and it was okay. Then it started leaking and now it no longer keeps my coffee hot for even a couple of hours. Not a good buy."
4,love it,"Love it, however do not drop it as the glass inside WILL break. I keep it by my bed and refill my water glass with cool water."
1,Leaks...,"This Thermos starting leaking on the fourth use, about a week after it arrived in the mail. I checked the bottom, made sure it was screwed tight, and all other parts looked like they are secure. Still leaks. I'll be returning it ASAP."
2,Too Brittle,"The container works great but it is very fragile. If you drop it or put ice directly into the room termperature container, the inside glass insulation will shatter. I've bought four of these things and they all would break one way or the other. Not good unless you handle them gingerly and don't travel with them."
1,Junk,Started leaking out the bottom in less than a week. Cheap price but another lesson in you get what you pay for.
5,Thermos 341OUSP,This isn't your dad's thermos... It is well made with a durable plastic outer-shell. The two stackable cups are great if you want to share your beverage and the inner screw cap has a small stash compartment for sugar or creamer. Great for the money!!
1,From mediocre greatness is possible,"I'm a big fan of Marge piercy and was looking forward to reading the nove. The best thing that can be said about it, is it's a good inight into marge piercy's writing career. This is a very early ovel and it reads like that. Polemic, shallow characters and a wandering plot. It's inspring to me, as an aspring writer, to realise someone like piercy, who i admire so much, did write mediocre stuff in her early days.Rohan"
5,Another impressive addition to the TZ library,"I could cop out and simply say that Albarella's As Timeless As Infinity is written such that it is more than worthy to be associated with the high quality of that most unique of television programs - but hell...anyone lucky enough to own any one of the volumes publish to-date knows that. This is beautiful work - well-thought out with rare photos and wonderful anecdotes from those responsible for its greatness.Serling would indeed be proud of these works. I confess to popping in DVDs and following along with each script - One gets a real appreciation for the art of the script and how it is brought to life and just how good these things were when conceived - nearly ""camera-ready""But I will also confess that I enjoyed reading Mr. Albarella's uniquely titled and very insightful episode commentaries as much or more."
3,Fun For The Whole Family,"Like his Which Way movies, Eastwood again makes a fun family film. This time he is a wannabe cowboy, who runs a wild west tent show.Falls for Locke, and has genuine fun."
1,Bronco Bland Billy,Bronco Billy is bland and corny. It is not funny. I only laughed once. It is boring. It is not believable. It is similar to a bad situation comedy.
2,wrong dvds to play in europe,the products I received they are not to be played in portugal that you send is (1) and it shoud be (2) . Watch your next shippments should be2..
2,The movie tries to be funny but...,The acting is below average. The movie tries to be funny but it's so forced that it's not.Clint Eastwood is much better in other movies.
4,Different,Bronco Billy is that different movie of Clint Eastwood's that you have been looking for. It's definitely different but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good for all ages.
4,pre chair syndrome,"Oddly Clint chats to real people and hides his secret super power of chatting with chairs ???Not once does he inject a false personality into any chair that he runs into, maybe because he was younger and wiser ???"
5,Prince's BEST! Also for the new millenium.,"This is Prince's BEST album, EVER! You can't go wrong here... All songs are really nice, strange, interesting, funky and cool! The lyrics are the best Prince ever has thought up, and years after still very up to date.Every Prince fan has this album allready. For everyone else: buy this album!"
5,It's not the White Album by the beatles but it's still great,"There are a lot of reviews out there that raise this album to almost unapproachable levels. Bottom line: this is a solid - one of the most solid - offerings from Prince. Lot's of pop, rock, and funk songs.I still say 1999 and Purple Rain stand out as the best of Prince but Sign 'O' the Times should still be in your collection.One huge negative has to be mentioned!!! This cd needs to be remastered. The sound is awful. I finally burned it into ITunes and changed the equalizer settings to get a half way decent sound but remastering would be a great idea."
4,Great Work!,"Almost every song is a masterpiece on this album. I said almost on purpose, cause songs like It, Forever in my life, and Strange relationship just doesn't fit into this album with their poor and dumb tunes. Some say Strange relationship is one of the best songs of it, I say it is one of the worst with it's monotonious drum-machine that is terrible. But there are more good songs then bad ones of course, like it used to be on other Prince albums. My favs are Housequake, Slow love, If I was your girlfriend and It's gonna be a beautiful night. This last song starts the new funky way that continues with the Black album and Lovesexy, another great album of his. Sign O' the Times was his best in the 80's with Purple Rain, but now the times'd changed. Get Emancipation to own the best Prince album!"
4,"Good, but not Great","Sign 'O' the Times is a good double CD. My two favorite tracks are Sign 'O' the Times and Housequake. The title song is definitely timeless. It's just as true today as it was almost 20 years ago. The disease with the little name is now known all over the world, and Meth replaced Horse in destroying a person in less than nine months. The remainder of the songs are dated. It is a good historical perspective for anyone that want to get a taste of what music was like in the late '80's. Unfortunately, I would have to say Controversy is MUCH better than Sign 'O' the Times."
5,Ultimate Work,"I have every album, single and maxi and this is by far his best work (2nd best is 1999). This being the first album after the Revolution era, there was no doubt that he was trying to prove (and he did) that he was still ""the man."" Not to mention the video recorded concert for this album. Again, there was no doubt. There was also no need for him to title this album because every song told a new story and had its own concept. If your a Prince fan (or a o-+> fan), you already have this album. If your not a fan, this album will certainly make you one. Enjoy!"
5,A bucket full of genius...,"The most superb recording ever released by Prince. I've personally heard every album he's ever released (and most of the bootlegs) and can't find one compilation of songs that even begins to rival this collection of masterpieces. ""Starfish and Coffee"" and ""The Ballad Of Dorothy Parker"" on one disc and ""Strange Realtionship"" and ""Adore"" on the other. What a mix-up! Each song is infinitely listenable and it just keeps getting better with age. The layering of lyrical and musical nuances is enough to keep you listening for decades. Buy this without hesitation...if you don't like it, send it to me...mine's getting worn out."
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE ALBUM BY HIM,"In my opinion this is his best album of his career.. i know people can make an argument for his other great work like Purple Rain, 1999, Dirty Mind, Controversy, but as great as they were this to me is even better .. Not as polished or highly commericial as Purple Rain or 1999 but what you get is raw funk grooves that will keep heads boppin plus throw in one knock out ballad Adore you have his best work that range from the genius of his early work to experimiting with other sounds.. There is so much to choose from on this double disc gemHighlightsSign o TimesHousequake One of the funkiest jams ever by himThe Ballad of Dorothy Parker.. very reminicient of Cameo's early workU Got That LookItI Could Never Take a Place of Your ManAdore.. Killah ballad one of his truly best ever"
5,The Must Have,"No, I'm not gonna say that this is the best album ever! But everyone who's seriously collecting works of Modern Music >must< have this. Wouldn't say that it is the essential Prince CD, since he is much too diverse to be reduced to only one, however if you're determined to have only one of his Albums, it's got to be SOTT!"
5,Prince's Best and most varied,Oh my god. Hearing this CD is like a religous experience! Just listen to Adore!Nuff Said!
4,An Overrated Album,"Though great, mixing rock, funk, jazz and pop, ranking one of this two best albums in the 80s with Purple Rain, it is an overrated album. Despite its experimentation in various musical styles, some of the songs are not so beautifully written and memorable. The good songs on the album are Sign of the Times, Playing in the Sunshine, Housequake, It, Slow Love, Hot Thing, Forever in My Life, U Got the Look, If I was your girlfriend, If I could never take the place of your man, The Cross and Adore. 12 good songs on one album are just great enough. The editoral review is correct: the sound is a bit dated in 2001. Yet the sound on Michael Jackson's Bad released in the same year is still fresh! Music needs polishing and editing! In my view, Purple Rain, Graffiti Bridge, Diamonds and Pearls, Come, The Gold Experience and Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic are more consistent and enjoyable."
3,Only got 1 disc,"Love the CD, but only received disc 1 and not disc 2. The CD was in good shape, but the CD box was distressed, so I'm not sure that it met the very good standard. I will contact Emerald City to see if the absent CD was just a mistake or if they only intended to send one disc"
4,rare,"As the years go on the harder it will be able to find prince's music. Glad to make this purchase, I will always ask for a lower price to make the purchase better. He is a real musician if your not a fan just see him preform at the George Harrison benefit with tom petty."
3,"I loved Star Wars too, but....","I read this book based on Nick Hornby's review in the Believer. It's a strange beast. Shone makes very clear that he wants to deflate the argument made by Biskind in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls that the Blockbuster killed the New American Cinema. I really did enjoy Biskind's book, though it certainly is gossip-laden and pretty fast and loose with the facts-- so I was quite interested to read Blockbuster for an alternate take on the ""Blockbuster killed the Art film"" debate. Unfortunately, it is pretty weak. While Shone derides Biskind's take on the after-effects of Jaws, etc. - he really doesn't back up his own stance beyond some very basic observations that do little to convince. Basically, there is not much meat to the book - some good anecdotes are sprinkled throughout, but nothing that doesn't seem like it could have come from a back issue of Premiere magazine. All said though, I did tear through it. The prose is engaging, and it's an easy read."
4,Pro Team Megavac,"This backpack vacuum is Pro Teams largest and most powerful. I use it for cleaning houses, boat, and car. Quality and performance is excellent. It is a tad heavy and bulky. I would have preferred a slightly smaller model, but the smaller units have smaller motors.My only criticism is that the covers on the top and bottom continually unscrew themselves and fall off (no matter how tight they are screwed on). It is difficult to screw them back on without taking the vac off. Quite annoying."
5,This book is a gem!,"Bob Christiansen presents the facts very well.He cited the scenario on its real perspective. Anyone who reads this will have no second thought of owning a shelter dog. I am touched from the story of Harry Oakes, the internationally known K9 Search and Rescue trainer and of course his hero and K9 partner, newfoundland mix Ranger who succumbed from hip dysplasia after serving SAR for many years."
5,"Love This! Easy to Use, Intelligent Design, Idiot-Proof!",I absolutely love my Zo Mini! I watched the helpful video and used the recipes in the booklet. The Basic White Bread turned out perfectly the first time. A superior product that is well worth the price. We're making loaves to take to the neighbors for Christmas.
5,perfection,"I got this for a birthday gift and could not be more pleased! the bread is absolutely perfect, control panel is idiot proof and the instruction book comes with some great receipes. I've used all of the settings offered and each is great. I especially love the french bread setting, the crust is fantastic.I am a first time breadmaker owner/ breadmaker and have not made a bad loaf yet thanks to this little Zojirushi! And since i live in an apartment with limted kitchen space it is absolutely wonderfully sized."
5,Great Bread Machine,"This wonderful little bread machine is just right for our family of four. It is really easy to use and makes excellent bread. I make white bread for my children and more ""adult"" bread for my husband and myself. I have not bought bread at the store since I received the Zoji."
4,Excellent to make bread and jam,It's a great machine for two people. The only thing I don't like is the handle is hard to keep out of the way when taking the bread out but it's a minor annoyance. It makes pefect jam.
5,Best. hands down!,"I used to own a different maker's breadmachine. It was all right, but it was incredibly loud and also huge. I also used to bake bread all by my hands, too. This mini is amazing. It is so compact that it does not take any space on my kitchen counter. It is so quiet that I can set timer before going to bed. The functions are easy. I am soooooo happy about this purchase. I am so glad I chose this machine. I already started to modify the recipes that came with the machine but they all worked so far. I recommend this machine to anyone. Do not wasted your money on cheaper machines! Buy this one. You won't regret."
5,ZOJIRUSHI MINI BREAD MAKER,I'm about to use this item again today. It did a wonderful job on the first loaf. I just need to find better TASTING recipes.
5,Repeat User,"This is my second Zoji bread machine in 20 years and I STILL LOVE IT. The results are absolutely perfect - I notice this model is quieter than the first. The front ""settings"" and timer panel has changed some but it's still user-friendly and simple. Having ""cheated"" and purchased another brand several years ago (which I used twice before consigning it to the back of a high shelf- ugh)I can honestly say I would never stray again ! Once more, you get what you pay for. Superb !"
5,Wonderful,Love this little bread maker... definitely worth the money and so easy to use! I live alone so the small size is perfect.
5,Fantastic Bread Machine,"I have had this bread machine for about two months now and I have loved it! I make several loaves every week and they all turn out delicious. The machine works great, excellent quality and workmanship on the product. I don't have any complaints at all and recommend this machine to anyone interested in a bread machine. It only makes the one pound size but it is just right for one person, I don't get bored eating the same ole loaf for long since I eat it up and make a different type next time. It has been so much fun making yeast bread because I did not have the knack to make it by hand, the rising part was impossible for me to do."
5,Best Thing in a Little Package,"I live alone and this breadmaker makes the prefect little loaf. I can make bread every other day and have fresh bread without going to the bakery. It is VERY quiet and cleanup is easy. Small and lightweight, well written instruction booklet. This breadmaker is definitely worth the money."
5,Great Little Breadmaker,"I ordered this bread maker before Christmas and made multiple loaves over the holidays. All the bread came out great. I used it to make a cinnamon roll recipe by making the dough in the unit, shaping the rolls and baking in the oven. The rolls were delicious. The size of the unit is nice; it takes up about as much room as my coffeepot. I gave away my old bread maker because the size of it made it impractical to leave out on the counter so I never used it. This bread maker is always ready to go. I like the size of the loaves - good for a meal for 4 without any waste."
5,Awesome Breadmaker,"This is an awesome little thing. The size of the loaf is perfect for a couple: anything larger we would just end up throwing away. And this machine has been on heavy rotation in our house for over a year. We bake about three breads a week and this powerful little thing still performs without a hitch. The breads turn out great, and this is across the whole spectrum, as we make some pretty dense whole-wheat German breads. Recently, we replaced the kneading blade because we had damaged it (our fault) and that was also a pleasant experience: affordable and quick shipping. I would definitely recommend this breadmaker without hesitation."
5,best thing since...sliced...bread...,"this thing is awesome. loaves are a bit small, but will serve 4 to 6 for breakfast. make most of a week's worth of lunch sammiches for 2. The smell of baking bread filling your house, with only a modicum of measuring on your part is pure magic. there are a bunch of modes. jsut got it recently, but have made 5 loaves in 3 days, and made awesome pizza dough (buy a pizza stone too). loaf baking time from ingredients in to loaf out range from 2.5 to 5 hours. this and a zojirushi rice maker are my 2 best kitchen investments... pretty much ever, (well, that henkels Santoku knife is used on the daily for about 5 years now, so add that to best purchases ever for full disclosure's sake(and it cost as much as this machine)(oooh nested parenthetical references!)).in short, buy this, or the bigger one. if you are at all dissapointed, it's because you didn't really want a breadmaker after all."
5,Excellent breadmaker-but can't recommend their recipes,"I bought the Zojirushi BB-HAC10 breadmaker in August 2008, and have used it regularly since. My 1st loaf using a recipe that came with the machine was disappointing, but when I switched to favorite recipes from Donna Rathmell German's Bread Machine cookbooks - small loaf quantities - the results have been uniformly excellent. It produces a nice crusty crust, high rising bread with good consistency. It is quiet, easy to use, easy to clean, with no problems after 15 months of use. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for home baked bread."
4,Good Machine with Blah Recipes,"The Zojirushi BB-HAC10 Home Bakery 1-Pound-Loaf Programmable Mini Breadmaker does exactly as it advertises; it makes 1-pound loaves of bread. It is very consistent in the breads that it makes, but all the recipes end up kind of the same in terms of texture and taste. I have been experimenting with the recipes to make a lighter more chewy loaf with limited success.A good machine but not worthy of a 5.0"
5,Great breadmaker,Really like this breadmaker for my compact kitchen. It does the gluten-free breads very well (follow directions from the package). Like the many options too.
5,Awesome,"First bread machine I've ever had, and it doesn't seem like it could get any better or easier. It takes me just 5 minutes to gather the ingredients, measure them out, and set up the machine. The timer function is very handy. I set it up before I go to work, then when I get home, the house smells like bread and it is ready for dinner."
4,Works but modified recipe,"As soon as I got the bread maker, I tried it out with the instructions pasted on the side and it worked great. Then I tried some of the recipes that came with the machine and it flopped for a while. The bread either didn't rise enough or collapsed because it ended up being really hard and really dense. However, it did come with a problem solving section so after tries or different water amounts and greatly increased amount of yeast, it worked and I have been enjoying fresh bread since. It is a perfect size for couples and really convenient."
4,"Love it, use it often, but the blade wore out in 1-year","Love it, use it at least 1-2 times/week. But the blade wore out after 1-year of usage. The nonstick coating is peeling off. I am looking for replacement on-line. It cost $8 + shipping. I guess it is not too bad."
5,Best bread maker in the world,"Simple and perfect bread. I have yet to make a bad load with this bread maker. I think I compared every machine made and read hundreds of reviews and I am so glad I chose this machine. It's the perfect size for a single person and doesn't take up a lot of counter space on my small kitchen counter. Clean up is nothing, just wipe it out with a damp cloth and you're done. The controls look more complex than they really are, just push one button to start. The loaf has so much more taste than the bread from my supermarket bakery. I do add gluten and use bread flour by King Arthur. The machine is well made, and the outside stays cool while baking.You'll love the Zoey."
5,Never a bad loaf,I researched the machines and decided on this model. I was not disappointed. I've been using it for months now mainly on the setting for Rapid Rise yeast which cuts down the baking time. I tried cookie dough & Jam once but that was not worth the trouble. The cake settings still come out looking like a loaf cake but that's to be expected. I make bread every couple days for two of us and we've been very happy never having a single bad loaf.
5,Best little bread machine around,"I have had three bread machines and this was my most recent purchase. I bought it just before Christmas and have used it just about every day for the most foolproof bread around. It never faulters and my family loves the end product.If you purchase this bread machine I suggest you also purchase ""Bread Machine Magic"", by Linda Rehberg & Lois Conway. They have bread making down to a science and every recipe I have tried so far has been a big winner. If you have put your bread machine in the closet order this book and I promise it won't go back to the closet again.A great combo, order the two together and you'll never by store bought bread again. Besides you'll save money. I can make a 1 lb. loaf for under a dollar and that's with the best flour you can buy, which is King Arthurs unbleached all-purpose. No need to buy bread flour when you use King Arthurs flour! Check them out at www.kingarthurflour.com."
5,Really pleased with Zoji,"I am really pleased with this machine. I've made 2 loaves and they both came out great! I totally appreciate and agree with the advice of another reviewer to use ""Smart Bread Recipes"" by Woodruff. Though the book is only available in the ""used"" section, it is worth the price - the breads are whole grain, delicious, and healthy. The tips on using diastatic malt powder, lecithin, and ascorbic acid are very helpful. I made the Corn Rye Bread yesterday; the Dijon Rye today; and tomorrow I'll make the Russian Black Bread. I'm baking them and freezing them for later use."
2,Lemon Purchase,"Mine lasted less than a dozen uses before sudden failure to run. I was past the warranty time, so didn't return it. In my opinion, it's overpriced for the features. The pan is tiny. I should have returned it as soon as it arrived.I bought the newer model 2 lb machine; it's great. Live and learn."
4,breadmaker,"The bread maker works very well but I wish I had gotten a bigger model. The bread is firm and the crust is crispy. There are other settings but I haven't tried them. Overall, I am very pleased with the Zojirushi -- just some regret over not having gotten the full size."
5,Perfect bread machine in a small household,"I've been using this bread machine for almost a year and haven't purchased bread in the store since. I love the ease of use, several settings, including dough setting . . .but most of all, it's size appeals to me. Counter space is a premium in my kitchen, but this machine is so small, it easily fits inside the cabinet between uses.The full size Zo this mini replaced, was used for 15 years so I'm confident the company builds these to last. It's so nice having having complete control of the ingredients that go into the bread without all the extra preservatives, etc. The smaller loaves are the perfect size for a one or two person household and recipes for larger machines can easily be scaled down to size, especially those using weight measurements as opposed to volume.All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase, just wish I'd found this lower price here as opposed to the higher in store price I paid."
4,Amazing convenience!,"I can't believe how easy this machine is to use and how there is not even really any clean-up, just wipe out with a paper towel. I am single and the size loaf is just right for me. I have only made two loaves, one white and one french following the recipes provided with the machine and they turned out pretty well. I have made bread the old fashioned way in the past and I must say that bread was better but a whole lot more time consuming. I am hoping that with experimentation I can improve on the bread from this machine. At any rate, the bread is much better than I can buy in the supermarket!"
5,"Nice, compact, quiet, simple to use . . . like it very much!","I have baked a couple of white flour loaves in this, and they were very tasty and browned nicely. It makes a good one pound loaf and the paddle is pretty easy to get out of it and doesn't leave as large a hole as other breadmakers I've used tend to do. My main purpose for this is to make dough that I then shape into loaves by hand and bake in my own oven. It's a perfect size for my family of 3. Because of its small size, it has made a better quality bread maker work with my budget. And the handle makes it great to move around to make room on the counter."
5,Much better than expected,"I have been an avid (amatuer) bread baker for some time and used to turn my nose up at the machines but this one really turned me into a believer. The quality,taste and ease to turn out a delicious loaf along with the aroma to wake up to thanks to the timer are beyond belief. A really nice surprise."
5,Awesome!,"We were a little hesitant about buying a bread machine that was double the price of many others, but this was the only small loaf bread machine we could find. We love Zojirushi machines (water boiler & rice cookers) so we were pretty sure we'd like this too. Too bad Amazon doesn't ship to Canada as we had to ship it to our American address, and then bring it on an airplane with us to our Canadian address.The bread turns out really nice. We use all purpose Canadian flour, which is as good, if not better than American bread flour. Our favorite is the Quick Method Raisin Bread, and it only takes appx 2.5 hours!We wanted to experiment with making red bean paste swirled in white bread, but haven't had much luck. The machine just mixed in the paste so well that it just became part of the bread. We had this type of bread in Japan a couple times before. Maybe if we throw the paste in during the first and second rise, it might turn out better?"
5,bakery bread maker,A great product! Tried several recipes and the results were super.The loaves are just the right size. Highly recommended!
5,Works at high altitude too!,"Pros:- It works at high altitude. (At elevation 9,000 feet, it makes superb bread.)- The recipes that come with the machine are clearly written and easy to follow.- The bread tastes wonderful and is of a very pleasant, flaky consistency.- The machine is so quiet, the first day I kept going back to see if it was still working.- The 1 pound size is perfect for couples.Cons:- As far as my family is concerned, there are no cons."
5,I love this machine,This one pound bread machine is easy to use and turns out perfect bread and cakes every time. The one pound size is perfect for us (two people) but could easily satisfy a family of four or six. Watching the VHS tape before you start is highly recommended. My only recommendation: produce a DVD since a lot of folks no longer have a VHS player.
3,100% Whole Wheat,The 100% whole wheat bread came out too hard and not bread-like. Had a yeasty taste and kind of flat. Decided to return and go for the bigger machine (Virtuoso).
5,idiot-proof bread is a reality,"Next to my electronic rice cooker, this is about the coolest kitchen appliance I've ever used, because it saves me enormous amounts of time that can be better spent elsewhere. Everything is automated. The only thing you must do in order to get a fresh loaf is add the ingredients in the prescribed manner, enter the appropriate settings with the controls, and wait. The non-stick pan makes serving and cleaning very easy.So far, I've had not a single botched loaf, just a whole lot of fresh, tasty bread that costs a quarter as much to make than to buy. There are plenty of recipes included in the instruction manual that work satisfactorily, but you might want to get a decent bread machine cookbook that focuses on higher-quality ingredients to get ""truly excellent"" rather than the ""merely good"" bread you get with the Zojirushi recipes."
1,bad experience,"I bought this bread machine to replace one I had for a good 20 years by National. The National was great and just died of old age. I went by the ratings for the Zojirushi and am very disappointed. I attempted to make 4 loaves going by their recipe and only one of the loaves turned out half way decent. I found that most of the time the ingredients just sit there, no kneading, resting they call it! Well all I would get at the end is a burned up mess of unstirred ingredients. I have returned it to amazon for a refund."
1,Bread Machine Fire Purchased from Amazon,I purchased the Zojirushi 1-lb Bread Machine. I placed all ingredients in baking pan as instructed and started baking process. My husband and I went out for dinner and when we came back we were greeted by the fire truck. The entire house was filled with black smoke and the machine had started a fire. My dog and cat had to be taken to the pet emergency clinic for smoke inhalation. I can't believe that Amazon still has this machine on their website after I reported this incident on the phone with them. My house could of been burned down to the ground!!
2,Is that NEW one??,"There are several scratches inside...Looks somebody returned it before, and I got it..."
5,works as promised,"This machine is more expensive than most of the others we looked at, but when we read reviews from all the other machines there was always something that was a deal breaker. Didn't read a single legitimate bad review about this machine, and it has not disappointed. Makes a wonderful loaf of bread. The 1 pound loaf is a bit on the small size, but it is a perfect loaf. Tried the banana bread, and it was not nearly as good as one we make in a conventional oven - a little bit dry and not enough banana flavor. Machine is quiet, and the bread comes out of the bucket easily."
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,I purchased this about 3 weeks ago and probably have used it every other day since then. We love it not only is the loaf small enough that you can use it up in 2 days but the loaves are perfect every single time. I have not had one of them flop or fail to rise properly and I have tried a ton of different recipes. I also purchased a bread cookbook from this site so I have been able to truthfully say it seems to work on all kinds of bread.Since I have owned 2 other machines previous to this I can say for me personally this is the best bread machine out there.
5,idiot proof,"and I mean that in the nicest way. I've baked two loaves already. The kids really loved the honey bread recipe. That teased their sweet tooth. The loaf is firm yet soft on the inside and that beautiful warmth and heat as the butter just runs down a slice is phenomenal. I have tried to be exact with measurements but I am sure I wasnt a chemist at it. Still, an amazing choice. We are a family of 5 and one loaf is perfect in size. No waste!"
2,Sorely disappointed,"Had read reviews & bought it. Worked beautifully the first 2 weeks, now it seems that the paddle is not mixing up the dough at all & I have a gooey mess! Im sending for a replaceemnt as I have faith in the reviews but Im only willing to give it one more try!"
3,breadmaker,Good breadmaker but can't make sourdough breads & nothing I read on Amazon.com info indicated that. Would not have purchased it had I known.
1,Dry and too tough to chew,"The reviews for this bread maker were so encouraging. It is quiet and mechanically works well, but we didn't care for the product it produced. We tried several times using the recipes in the accompanying manual. Not one of the attempts came out satisfactory - we are returning it and looking for another brand."
1,Makes absolutely tasteless bread.,"I replaced my wonderful Dinner for Two bread machine that is no longer made with the Zojirushi Mini. It bakes a beautiful loaf, once I started using the soft crust setting, but it has absolutely no taste, when toasted it has an airy texture. I have made the basic white and a part whole wheat neither taste like bread."
5,Worth the price,This bread maker is one of the best machines I have ever used. It is user friendly and the receipes are easy and precise. I would recommend this product to anyone who either has used one before or wants to purchase one for the first time.
5,SO EASY EVEN I CAN MAKE BREAD!,"I have never baked bread before so was puzzled to receive this breadmaker as a gift. I read the booklet, watched the DVD, & made the 100% whole wheat bread following the recipe exactly. I couldn't believe how easy it was to make. The 1st loaf looked too good to be real & tasted even better. I have adapted recipes with great success making mostly 100% whole wheat adding wheat germ & omitting fat, milk, sugar, & some of the salt. I also use the ""dough"" function. Worth it just for the smell of freshly baked bread in the AM. And how did I thank the person I who gave it to me? -- with a basket of my homemade bagels of course!"
5,Amazing,"I bought this as a gift for my parents and when I go over there I'm amazed at the quality of bread. Excellent texture, nicely cooked and a nice light crust. They have been using it for a year now with no problems.They did buy another bread pan for it because they thought that after making the raisin bread it leaves a slight flavor in the the next loaf (yes they washed it). Now they have a dedicated pan for each type.I know they have made white bread and cinnamon raisin bread with this machine. My mother and father both use the machine and they both have excellent results. She says they don't watch the dough at all just measure the ingredients and let it do it's thing.This makes a nice size loaf that slices into a normal size that fits in a toaster."
2,bread making works for about 1 year,"I still have other products made by zojirushi that have lasted over 3-4 years. But this one is disappointment.Here is why:1) Used only commercial available high quality breadmix and yeast from day one the bread was less than normal quality in terms of baking function. I was still happy for 1st year as it was atleast doing the grunt work of getting bread ready regardless of baking quality.2) after one year no matter what yeast or what breadmix I try, the dough never rise enough and baking makes it like stone hard no matter what setting i tried.I even tried rising the dough outside with manual method and just added dough back to this machine for baking and it still does not bake it right. My whole experimentation with this zojirushi machine is failure.Only thing this machine can do is knead the dough for you and still functioning after 3 years for kneading only.Thanks"
5,Great bread maker,Using the recipes in the book/video are easy and makes great bread. Loaves are perfect size for two. Runs a lot quieter than the last breadmaker we had.
1,Makes a poor loaf of bread,"I have a large bread maker which I was using less and less because of it's size. I thought getting the ""mini"" breadmaker would work better. I like the size of the smaller machine as I can keep it on my counter and handle it easily. However, I was very disappointed in the quality of the bread. I tried 3 different recipes. One was the Seven Grain Bread recipe using the ""Firm"" setting. It came out damp and soggy; the Cheese and Onion just didn't work at all--didn't rise; was just a lump. I tried a modified recipe with partial bread flour and wheat flour. That worked the best, but the loaf was very small, hard, and lumpy. It was very difficult to get decent shaped slices from it. I guess I'll go back to my large breadmaker or just make bread the old fashioned way."
5,this is one of the funniest movies ever made,"i had almost forgot how funny real men was when i rented it , i had only seen it on tbs a few times but let me just set up this ""clip"" james belushi is nick, nick walks into his bosses office to give him a map he has gone great lengths to get as he holds his hand out a man standing in the corner leaps infront of him and grabs the map, and throws it out the window where another man catches it and drives off, he is escorted out of the office screaming, ""We have the map, and you'll never get it back!!!"" nick looks up and says ""its ok, that wasnt the map"", ""what was it?"", ""it was a note telling them i know who their leaders are"", ""who are their leaders?"", ""i dont know"", i just died laughing and i am dead set on purchsing this movie now, it is hard to find, no one seems to know this movie, but is it freaking great, the plot line is somewhat silly, but only in the style of the movie, not insane"
5,Real Men,This is a very funny movie. Jim Belushi and John Ritter are great together and really play well against each other. I couldn't recommend this movie more.You will get some belly laughs from it.
3,Good actors but a weak story,"John and Jim are two great comedy actors, and they perfectly compliment each other's styles in this film...but the plot is just so far-fetched it hurts. It was really funny as Jim told John all sorts of lies to get his help, then you found out that all the ""lies"" were real and the story just becomes too far-fetched to hold on to. I have to say, however, that Jim Belushi's scenes with the girl he picks up at the bar are as hilarious as a film can get! Well worth watching for those minutes alone. Throw in some excellent acting from John Ritter and you get a film worth spending 2 hours to watch, but you probably won't watch it again and again."
3,Real Men,"This was an okay movie. It had a lot of weird scens in it which I guess made the movie interesting to watch. The only really bad part of the movie is that they really made john ritter out to be a real wuss. All and all it was an okay movie though. john and his sidekick james belushi embark on a really intersesting adventure to try and save the world before the aliens take it over and the only way to save it is with one glass of water,lol. At least watch it once so im not the only one writing a review"
5,Martin Booth's finest,One of the best books I have ever read and certainly one of Martin Booth's finest. I recommend this book highly.
4,Intrigue - love- sadness spellbindingly honest,Yet another spellbinding read by Martin Booth who has the ability to pick you up and carry you along with his characters he is a remarkable author - such is his understanding and sensitivity don't miss this one.
4,Very good introduction to root cause analysis.,"This book does an excellent job of quickly covering conventional root cause analysis. With an emphasis on documentation, the author takes you through a series of steps that include defining the problem, methods for collecting data and gathering information, analysis of the problem, and ultimately developing corrective action. This book moves very fast, reading more like a slide-show presentation than a book, yet the author is able to communicate a lot of good information using this minimalist approach. Rather than detailing numerous analysis methods, the author keeps it simple by sticking with a fixed path to problem solving. I found the ""Pitfalls of ..."" sections after each topic very insightful. In addition, the collection of forms, tables, and checklists included in the book (great appendix) are excellent. Don't look for case studies here, this is a straight forward how-to book"
1,Boring,"Big disappointment! It is not the older original Havoc In Heaven. My children and I had greatly enjoyed stills in book form of a different Havoc In Heaven film by Yan Dingxian, Pu Jiaxiang, Lin Wenxiao, etc. It was made into a lovely, intelligent book by Tang Cheng published by Foreign Languages Press, Beijing, 1979? The art in these stills is gorgeous & so is the story line.This film I'm reviewing is boring,dumb, maybe fundamentalist so I discarded it."
4,Dominique Moceanu: An American Champion is good book!,"I liked this book, probably because I am in love with Domi! It had a lot of information on Dominique and her gymnastics career, however,I wish that it had more info on her personal life. She talked a lot about competitions and such,but she didn't mention things like boyfriends and what her family does together. Dominique didn'tgive a whole lot of detail about anything. If you love Gymnastics, then you should read this book.If you love Dominique, you should still get this book, but you may be a little disappointed"
3,Too short - better for younger readers,"I would recommend this book for younger readers. It doesn't give a whole lot of detail about events in her life and, being a huge gymnastics fan, it is not one of the best gymnastics books I've read."
2,I gotta dissent....,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE French films, Theater of the Absurd, Surrealism, Dada, Ionesco, Beckett, Genet. I think all the actors in this film are tops, especially Bernard Blier. But this movie is like a high school exercise in all of the above styles - it's shallow, predictable & not at all imaginative. The only thing that saves it for me is Michel Serrault's cameo scene in the beginning. Maybe I would liked it more if I were dependent on sub-titles."
3,Hot to Not,"This was a pretty good read. The first half to 3/4 of the book was awesome--I couldn't put it down. The storyline was great, the love scenes were very HOT. However, I was VERY disappointed in how it ended. It's like the author just decided to end the book. I was literally looking to see if the last few pages had been torn out of my book because it was such an abrupt ending, which really bothered me. The story got very boring toward the end. Once the characters declared their love for each other, it was very dull and really had no further excitement. There was many opportunities for excitment, but like I said, it's like the author just decided she was done with this book. Overall, it's a good read til you get to the middle, then it peters out and doesn't get any better."
5,Like Monet,"More like a Monet than a photograph, McDermott's, ""At Weddings and Wakes"" reveals its beauty by memory impressions rather than by the harsh black lines of plot. No less lost than others who have written here in the ebb and flow of the timeline, I, however, trusted the author. And soon I was intermixing with the memories of the book my own childhood memories - and identifying, in the moment, with the joys and tragedies of this family. I dare suggest any who read this book, liking it or not, will find themselves remembering family stories of times past - memories happy and sad, with characters tragic and heroic and possibly rethinking them in the light of McDermott's graceful treatment of such moments. It was an exquiste read. That is, for those who are comfortable with impressions leading you to see clearly the beauty in life's tragedies and joys, as like a Monet painting. But if you need/seek/want the clarity of a photograph for beauty - skip this book."
3,Beautifully Boring,"It is a shame that this novel, which has some of the most hauntingly beautiful writing I've come across, is so deadly boring. While Alice McDermott is capable of creating some wonderful scenes - some funny, some heartbreaking, many recognizable - because this novel is a string of memories there is no conflict, no real dramatic tension. I have no problem with slow-moving, contemplative novels, but there has to be some through-line; otherwise, what you end up with is oftentimes similar to this book. ""At Weddings and Wakes"" is like a well-written diary: fascinating, sad, funny, and tender, and when you've finished all you have are snapshots, not a novel."
1,TOO MANY WORDS,"If half the words in this book were left out, maybe you could find a story there you could get into. The superfluous descriptions of subway rides, door handles, stone steps and wet leaves left me groping to find anything to carry me through this book. Almost two thirds through I realized I had no idea what was going on so I left the book in a coffee shop on purpose. I never missed it. I feel bad for whoever found it."
3,Rememberance of things past redux,"This book evokes memories of my own childhood growing up in New York City and spending time on the trains and buses that took us out to the Bronx or down to Lower Manhattan to visit family. The textures of the train cars as well as the scents and sounds round out the sense memory of those years. The displacement of time and place may be a bit disorienting but the story is not so difficult to follow and clues are strewn along the way with the ""end"" about half way through for those who are paying close attention. McDermott captures the zeitgeist of the time which was simpler and more innocent. I found it satisfying and worthwhile although the subject is less than uplifting."
3,Not for everyone,"This is the third McDermott book I've read (Charming Billy and Child of My Heart) and the first one that I didn't absolutely love. The writing is beautiful, but the lack of anything remotely resembling a plot made it a bit of a slog for me. Rather than rely on a through line, it read like a family scrapbook taken in a very particular place and time.As usual, I found the characters well drawn and slightly mysterious, with the exception of the mother whose unhappiness I can only say must have been genetic.Still a fan of McDermott's. There is no doubt she is hugely talented."
1,Boring -Chick flick!!,"Boring! Detailed interpesonal discussions within a family of Irish women.On and on and on.Maybe if you are an Irish women with family memories and lots of anxt from your childhood you can get some enjoyment (or pain) out of this story.Reminds me of one of the endless ""chick fliks"" being ground out by Hollywood. Recently I had to sit through one of these on a plane trip. Brutal! At least with this book I could throw it across the room. Which I did.I got this book becouse it was referred to by other Irish books but ended up dissapointed."
1,another disappointment,"I keep hearing all of these wonderful things about McDermott's books, but I just cannot seem to find the light that people are talking about. In ""weddings and wakes"" I kept expecting some sort of development and none could be found. There was no character development and like in the Bigamist's daughter you are left with a feeling of apathy towards the characters. I was expecting so much more but found myself painfully pushing through this book."
5,Very comfortable sneaker!!!!,"I am on my feet for 9 to 10 hours during my work day. Even though these sneakers are for running, they are a very very good sneaker for walking!!I recommend these sneakers to anyone who needs to be on their feet a lot!"
2,Comedy?,"This film fails as a comedy, it fails as a vampire film with really silly vampire effects; the vampire's eyes glow different colours depending on how she's feeling; when she's feeding madly, they're glowing red, when she's happy they're a soothing green - obviously because the director thinks the audience is so dumb as not to be able to tell without all these additional 'hints'.When released here in Australia they had so much faith in it, that they renamed it ""A French Vampire in America"" in order to cash in on the fact that it was done by the same guy who did ""An American Weerewolf in London"" (which really does blend horror and laughs much more effectively)But, in short this is about a French vampire in America who feeds on Italian (mafia men). She has scruples, because she only kills bad guys, then blows their head away to stop them coming back as vampires too. Dumb!"
1,Drector of American Werewolf in another duff film shock!,"Comming from John Landis I was expecting big things, but boy was I wrong. I had been told by friends that this was an 'hilarous' comedy. So I sat there for almost 2 hours waiting for the comedy to start strangely enough it didn't. The 'hilarous' mourge scene almost raised a smile, almost.In the end i watch it all to see if it could get any better, but nope it didn't.You can see them in the movie moguls office trying to sell it ""yeah gangster movies are hot, but since Scream so is horror what can you do John"" light goes on ""yeah i know we will do a gangster Vampire film yeah great, and becasue no one will be able to take this seriously we will call it a 'Comedy'""Lame"
5,Never play with the food!,"Start with The Mob, throw in some vampires, let John Landis loose, and you've got Innocent Blood, one of my personal favorites. Anne Parillaud is simply delicious...sorry about that...and her ""never play with the food"" line is priceless. Landis took some heat about all the car crashes in Blues Brothers so he shows total restraint in this film, until he just couldn't stand it one minute longer. The last third of the film is filled with Landis style car wrecks. Very entertaining and absolutely delicious...sorry, again."
3,FRENCH VAMPIRE,"A great film,more humour than horror! Good cast with witty dialogue and good script.Unfortunately the DVD has no extras,but that will not stop me from getting this film,as it is worth owning.I have to say that over here,the title is ""FRENCH VAMPIRE IN AMERICA"" A more suitable title and one that i wish was named everywhere else.I have to see if it will be released here on DVD,and if it has the same title.Regardless,i'm happy this is available on DVD and have to say I enjoyed it more than ""AMERICAN WEREWOLF"""
4,"What, no sequel?",Excellent horror/black comedy/gangster flick. Anne Parillaud is awesome! This movie BEGS for a sequel. QUICK! BEFORE THE ACTORS GET TO OLD!
4,"""He Ate My Manny!""","4 1/2 Stars = Minor MasterpieceJohn Landis's, Vampire companion piece to his masterful ""An American Werewolf in London,"" is grossly underrated!One of the more successful & original Vampire movies of all time! Featuring, beautiful Anne Parillaud as the Vampire, who has a taste for bad boys. Anthony LaPagila as an undercover cop, infiltrating the mob, & the undead. A hilarious black comedy performance by Robert Loggia as the mob boss turned Vampire, & how could anyone not like a movie with Don Rickles as the Mob lawyer?My favorite line?""He ate my Manny!"""
3,Vampira meets the Godfather,"What A creative idea! Take a sexy female vampire and have her stalk Italian mobsters in Pittsburgh. I really enjoyed this film for a couple of reasons. There really is no other vampire flick like this at all. John Landis is a genius at mixing the elements of classic horror with comedy and making it work. Take gangsters,erotic vampirism,good soundtrack and this is what you get. The only bad thing is that the film runs a wee bit too long(112 minutes). There are scenes that could have either been cut or shortened. But in all this is a very enjoyable flick."
4,Just Plain Funny,"I am a science fiction fan and I like some horror movies. That's NOT why I like this film. If you want unrelenting gore and true science fiction you probably should look elsewhere. But if you like unusual genre combinations you should appreciate this one. Objecting to the mix of the mafia and vampirism means that you've just missed the point entirely. I found the mix hilarious. The movie requires that you just suspend judgement, and enjoy the unfolding of the what if proposition: What if the Godfather had been bitten by a female Dracula? The fact that the screenwriter thought to ASK that question cracks me up. What is more serious and harrowing than a mafia film? To me comedy is about the surprise element, the ability to turn generally serious matters and turn them on their head. If you can allow for that, you'll be on your way to seeing how and why this film succeeds."
3,Innocent Blood,"This is one of the better vampire movies that I really enjoy. It has a nice blend of comedy and horror....all rolled into one!! Nice transfer to DVD, but that's about it. Everything else [disappointed]! Warner Bros. really know how to jack up movies for DVD! There are NO bonus features....nothing special about this DVD. Since it wasn't such a blockbuster, I guess it didn't deserve to get anything special when it was released on DVD. I guess it's cool... guess I got what I paid for!! I still felt as though they could have done more for this movie."
1,False advertising,"I am hearing impaired and only ordered this disc because it is advertised to have English subtitles. It has no subtitles and was, therefore, a waste of my money."
3,They work but not that great,I purchased the Hitachi blades to do the cement siding on my house but also purchased the Pac Tool shears at the same time. There was only one cut in a piece of trim that the shears couldn't do and the blades worked ok but with a good deal of dust.
5,Does a great job,"Haven't cut a whole lot of siding pieces yet, but what I have cut has worked great. The blade cuts easily and leaves a pretty nice edge. Good results on both long cuts to fit around a window and some smaller cuts with a little contour to fit around a socket. Blade is still sharp and clean."
5,Bodum Columbia Stainless-Steel Sugar and Creamer Set,I purchased the coffee and creamer set for my wife (can't convince her to drink the good stuff black and hot). She said she loves how the creamer keeps the heavy cream ice cold. She also said the brown sugar stays soft in the sugar bowl for days. We both like the quality and art deco look and highly recommend the product.Bodum Columbia Stainless-Steel Sugar and Creamer Set
5,Sugar and Creamer Set,"These perfectly match my large Bodum French press and will live on the counter top as useful decor. They arrived on time in good condition and I would purchase again from this seller. They are a bit smaller than I anticipated, the creamer lid is well designed and stays on when pouring either liquid or dry creamer. If you like modern design, you will love this quality set."
1,Nice looking but not as functional as it should be.,"Nice looking set. However, the creamer has a serious flaw. The opening is too small and the coffee creamer tends to plug up the opening after one use. A shame they couldn't design it a little better."
3,nice design.,"I loved the simplistic appeal, but I can't figure out the creamer. The cover keeps falling into into the milk."
4,Stylish and Practical,I was fed up of my glass creamer sets always ending up broken or chipped. I opted for this set because it matches any tea or coffee set and it is very durable. Like the tight fitting creamer lid that doesn't fall off and allows a controllable stream of milk to pour out.
5,perfect,a little small but still perfect. will complement my bodum columbia french press. It is not brushed but shinny stainless still.. very contemporary which is my style. love it
4,pretty good,"This is a very cute sugar and creamer set. My only gripe is that the lid to the creamer is so tight that when I use cream, it clogs up in there and blocks the spout next time I want to use it."
5,great gun,"I've had this gun for almost 4 years now and i have to say that this gun is the best!!! I have used plenty of other rifles and i've never got the same accuracy and power. This gun can shoot lizzard sized tagets perfectly from long distances so immagine a larger target. The amount of power depends on how many times that you pump it and it uses zinc bbs. All in all, i think that this gun is about the best deal out there!!!"
1,awful!!!!!!,"I think it is awful that this would even be advertised as a clildrens toy.Why do children need to be subjected so much violence. I was looking for a TOY that my grandson could pretend to cut trees with ,NOT BLOODY"
3,Creepy!!!,"I have heard of the brand Leatherface a lot in the hardware store. I kind of get it confused with those guys who dress up in San Francisco (I live there) at the parades, so I was kind of confused when I found it was a hardware supplier. Well, this is just creepy. I don't understand why you would sell a chainsaw with what looks like blood on the blade! Certainly this isn't what most human people are going to use their chainsaw for. Maybe a butcher might use a chainsaw. I would have to research that. When I finally choose my chainsaw it is going to be used for wood and wood only! I'm also a little suprised that the chainsaw would advertise itself with ""sound."" In looking for a chainsaw, I want one that runs as quiet as possible so that I don't wake up the neighbors. The price on this one makes me suspect too. So in conclusion, I don't think this is a good chainsaw because it shows blood on the picture and it is probably very loud. I don't know."
5,The Realities of War,"This book was popular and scandalous when released -- an unvarnished perspective of what it was really like to be a World War I pilot. Particularly shocking was the author's recounting the fact that the men were drinkers and skirt-chasers.One pilot's daily recollections communicate the joys of flying and the sense of profound loss that occurs as comrades fall.Pilot John M. Grider, who died in France, was the author of the diary which was edited and amended by a friend."
4,Great Stuff,"It was one of those books you couldn't put down...Cheney and Shiloh have a connection similar to Katheren Hephburn and Carey Grant...I wanted the next book as soon as I read this one...I just can't quite believe the ending, their has to be another book in the works...."
4,Fairly good reading...,"This book, like the others in the Cheney Duvall series, is not always realistic or totally believable, but those weaknesses can be overlooked because the sparks between Shiloh and Cheney are there, and we all want to know what happens between them!"
3,"Weakest book in series, but a must-read for serious fans.","Island of the Innocent is a let-down from the previous books in the series because it lacks the depth of characters and strong plot line that the first six books have demonstrated. If you are a die-hard Cheney fan, you must read this book to find out what happens to Cheney and Shiloh. I would not, however, recommend this book for anyone's first exposure to the Cheney Duvall, M.D. series. I hope that the next book in the series is more in line with the first six than Island of the Innocent is."
2,Not so sure why everyone loves these books,"I like Gilbert Morris - the Wakefield Dynasty and Spirit of Appalachia books were wonderful - but honestly I couldn't appreciate Cheney and Shiloh very much. Their interactions don't seem natural at all, Cheney is an annoyingly stiff character, and I can't help but feel like the story is strikingly reminiscent of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman...Sometimes I get wrapped up in the plots, and other times it's hard for me to stay interested. Characters like Walker are endearing, but the main characters are less so. Rather indifferent."
4,whoa! hold on for the ride!,"all I can say is ""wow."" this may not be my favorite Cheney book, but it offers the most thrills and spills. it goes so in depth into Cheney's relationship with God, and then takes it even further by searching out her relationship with Shiloh. one of the really exciting things is that Shiloh finally finds out about his past. growing up as an orphan, he has kinda been a loner all his life. but now he finds out about what really happens, and even more surprises await! Cheney and Shiloh are put through the ultimate tests of their friendship/relationship, even to the point of being willing to die for the other if neccessary. I can hardly wait for book eight! the suspense is to much for me!"
5,One of the Best!,"The entire Cheney Duvall series is fabulous! This particular book was action-packed, creative, and full of surprizes. The ending blew me away, and left me hanging. I can't wait for the eigth book to come out.The characters in this series make it such a huge success. Shiloh and Cheney are so human, and so likeable. They are everything one would ever like to imagine.By far,this is one of the best book series I've read in a long time, and I do a lot of reading."
3,Weems and Plath Ship's clock,"The ""Bell"" on this product is rather wimpy. We had an old Seth Thomas ship's clock before which had a much better Bell. The numbers on the Seth Thomas were larger, which we liked better. Other than that, the new clock is fine."
1,EMI-STOP USING COPY CONTROL ON CDS-WE CAN'T PLAY THEM!,"I got ""tricked"" by EMI Records on Kasey's last Aussie Cd single ""True Colours""-which had their ""Copy Control"" feature on the CD (rendering it useless for play on most CD players, as well as most computer CD players)....Sony Music has just STOPPED using this ridiculous system due to the high volume of consumer complaints. How long do you think it will take EMI before they wake up? It's a shame too, as Kasey Chambers deserves better."
5,These tapes are incredible!!!,My 2yr old is learning songs in four different languages...and so am I!!! All parents should expose their children to foreign languages at an early age.... it's amazing how much they're capable of at such a young age.
3,Tatting Needle,I purchased this as a gift for my niece who is interested in learning to do needlework. I'm hopeful she be happy with it.
4,Learning to Tat,I hope to have a chance to try this in the near future. The holidays have taken all of my time currently. I hope to learn tatting really soon. Thanks
5,This is the story of the Indian wars between the conquest of Canada and the American Revolution.,"Like Parkman's other works this book is intricately documented. It is the story as it was written by the people who saw it. Much of it is disturbing. It is not idealized or whitewashed. If you want to know what really happened on the frontier between 1763 and 1776, this is it."
3,Biblical Rhetoric,"Hello,Readers interested on the subject will found a systematisation of textual structure in Roland Meynet ""Rhetorical Analysis. An Introduction to Biblical Rhetoric"""
3,"Nice, but...","I ordered three of the 12"" Magnetic Tool Holders, two for the kitchen and one for the shop. 30 lbs of holding power sounded like a lot. I'm not sure where that number comes from. Knives, small screwdrivers, all work great, but try to put something that weighs much more than a pound on it and it falls right off. I had a fish scale handy and used it to pull a paring knife off at 1.5 lbs.Otherwise, nice looking and they will serve for holding knives in the kitchen and small tools in the shop."
4,Well prepared commentary,I appreciate the depth in which the commentary was written. There many excellent examples and much historical data in this commentary. I highly recommend for personal study.
2,PLEASE...,"I don't understand why Cecilia Bartoli is loved for a lot of people. In a many cases, there are high notes with estridence, gasping, and also the vibrato is excesive . If you want to enjoy a great Rossini's opera, listen Maria Callas and Victoria de los Angeles."
4,Tough but interesting...,"Though no book will make you a filmmaker, some will help you refine your vision. This book, for me, added some poetry and texture to the imagery already in my mind. Pretty much the only thing that will improve your film skills, is making them."
5,..,"if i received a quarter for everytime i realized what an excellent film stardust memories is, the computer i am writing on would be rotating rapidly around my body."
3,Interesting Descriptions Of Different Types Of Women,"Stardust Memories is one of Woody Allen's most philosophic movies. It not only describes the life and thoughts (meaning the outer respectively inner life) of a celebrated comedy writer, it also gives some ambitious characteristics of the very different types of women to whom the writer is attracted.Despite its brilliant plot, promising attempts and interesting characters, Stardust Memories never really suceeds in becoming a fully entertaining, catching, and complete story."
4,Just getting started!,"As a collector that is just getting started in this field, I found this book both highly interesting and amazing. Anyone who is interested in this field will find this book enjoyable. I would have given it five stars, but it is the first one I have read and did not have a reference point."
5,Love it!,"Awesome book, lots of art environments that I had never heard of before. There is a list of 5 or 6 pages' worth of environments in the back of the book, many of which I would not have known about otherwise. I wish there were more photos, too!"
3,"Facts, statistics and determinism","First - someone in an earlier review said that this book is not for everyone, it's an academic book. Well that doesn't mean that only academics should read it, does it?The book presents lots of facts and statistics, and then tries to explain ""the informational economy"" and the economic development. Many impressed academics have written many reviews on this one. It's not a bad book, but it's no ""Das Capital"" either. In 10 years it'll probably not be as ""important"". It's a very good contemporary piece though.../JBgood, Kista"
5,Rumpole of the Bailey Seasons 1 and 2,Rumpole is unique. Good to watch several times to enjoy all the nuances you may have missed the first time.
3,Great content. Bad DVD implementation.,The enjoyment of this great series is indeed hampered by the poor technical implmentation in DVD format. The audio is difficult to hear and their are no subtitles of any kind to help to decipher the British accents which make this series enjoyable. How disappointing!
4,Rumpole,"I purchased Rumpole of the Bailey, set 1 for my husband christmas present. It was on his wishlist. Initially, I thought this would not be a show that would interest me but after watching only few episodes. I was hooked, the main character Rumpole pulls you into his world almost immediately. He is what you hear and see. You either like him or hate him. I would recommend this older T.V. show... if you enjoy english humor."
5,A Long Time Coming,I agree whole-heartedly with the other reviewers. Rumpole on DVD has been a long time coming. Great series; can't wait for the other seasons.
3,okay is not good enough,I thought I would really like this but alas it could not keep my interest. I would not buy it again nor watch it again.
5,Reluctant Spouse Agreed to Watch and Loved It!,"My serious minded spouse, who is more interested in Astronomy, Physics, etc, reluctantly agreed to watch the first episode with me. We quickly ran through all of the shows in about 10 days. We both loved them! Strongly recommend this DVD set to anyone with an interest in intelligent television and movies. The Rumpole series explores several contemporary themes, including the ethical issues of lawyers defending clients they know to be guility, the impact of family loyalties and office politics, the nature of racial and sexual prejudice, etc. Definitely a keeper!"
5,Great for Urgent Care,"I am an urgent care physician and have found this book incredibly useful in my day to day practice...great ""watch out to not miss this"" notations! Highly recommend!"
3,overrated,I purchased this book based on good reviews and found content of this book not much adding to my knowledge.
5,"Careful, Fragile!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This set took me 5 hours and 30 minutes to build. Don't hold it by the plastic top because I used to do that and I dropped it, but thankfully it landed on a pillow.I used the Bespin Guard's head and hands for my Mace Windu, But my dog bit on it so now I don't have it any more. I lllllllllllllllooooooooooovvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeee having BOBA FETT!!!!!!!!Awesome set overall a must buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great set overall,"This is the great set, it has great detail on the exterior and you get a decent amount of minifigures. This set is very durable for the most part. While you are building it the set isnt breaking like some other ones. The only problem with this set is the interior because you can fit boba fett in there nicely but what about the other figures. There is no room for them inside it but other than that this is a great set."
1,The bottom falls out,"My son and I spent hours trying to put Slave I together. The bottom is very unstable because of the curve pieces. If you push the block part of the curve piece down onto the base, the curve side pops up. When you flip Slave I over, you will see that you will need to add more pieces to reinforce the base. So, make sure you have additional Lego pieces. We enjoy putting Star Wars Lego sets together but this is one expensive set that you can do without. If you want the minifigures, then you're better off finding them elsewhere."
1,"One step forward, Two steps back","This ship is really poorly designed. REALLY! I kept waiting to get to the point where the ship would be supported well enough for it to stop falling apart everytime I added a new piece. The only way to build this ship and not get completely frustrated is to use glue. I have nearly all the lego ships, big and small, and all the technic lego star wars people (clones, darth varder, r2d2, etc.)and have never has such a problem. They should fire the person who designed this. I'm only 9 and I've designed better ships than this!Also, it is much smaller that it looks on the box, or that the size of the box would indicate.I'm fairly certain that the good reviews must have been written by someone selling this item. This one is not worth the money!"
2,Don't BUY!!!!!!,"it comes with Boba Fett, Han Solo in carbonite, Denger, IG88 and a bespin guard. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! IT DOES NOT STAY TOGETHER!!!!! IN FACT I RETURNED IT TODAY!!!!!!!!!"
5,Rutlemania Is Here!,"Finally available on DVD, this treasured parody of the England's FAB Four is given new life and is welcomed to true Rutle fans of all ages. Sit back with your tea AND biscuits and Meet Dirk, Nasty, Stig and Barry who will warm their way into your funny bone. Remember: All you need is lunch!"
5,The best of the Beatles Parodies..,"Higly recomend this for ONLY beatles fans. This was and is not intended for the average fan who just loves the ""Mop tps"" this is for the serious Beatleologist. Lots of fun and great songs."
3,Not Nearly As Funny As I Remember...,"I remember watching this movie on VH1 years ago and thinking that it was funny. But watching it again recently, I realized it is not nearly as funny as it could be. There are a few funny gags, but not nearly enough funny, memorable lines. The pros of this movie are: great cameos, catchy Beatles-eque songs, the depictions of Idle as Paul and Innes as Lennon, and some funny laughs with Idle as the narrator. However, this movie is nowhere near as funny as Spinal Tap and doesn't even come close to Holy Grail. Whereas those two movies had lines that were so memorable that they are still quoted today, The Rutles movie is missing that. It doesn't have a very good flow to it and it feels choppy and there is too much time between each joke. Very original when it came out, but I think it will always be overshadowed by Spinal Tap."
5,It was certainly their tight pants,"I love the Beatles and have followed them since 1964when I saw ""A Hard Day's Night"" on a double bill with""Fairy Cross the Mersey"". Like Elvis before them, these fellows just sort of fell into it. The movie shows you that the music they started with wasn't all that good or original. Bob Dylan was original.So why these strange British poor guys made good isjust one of those historical musical wonders.That they actually did become good is the other..."
3,Better in conception than in reality.,"This was...okay, you know? Not hilarious, at least not in the way that I found other ""music mockumentaries"" like SPINAL TAP or A MIGHTY WIND hilarious. Not even hilarious in the way that Monty Python were hilarious when they really let fly. The best parts of ALL YOU NEED IS CASH are the song parodies--Neil Innes managed to capture each stage of the Beatles musical history and give it the proper send-up. But the visual jokes are not enough to sustain the show for the whole length and I found myself looking at my watch a lot of the time. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm also glad I only rented it and I'm planning to stick with the soundtrack album and ARCHAEOLOGY whenever I need to get ""rutled."""
3,great songs; moderately funny film,"Beatle fans tend to regard The Rutles very warmly--and no wonder: the whole project is plainly a love letter to the Beatles phenomenon. It should be said, though, that the best thing about the whole thing is the brilliant and funny musical pastiche by Neil Innes--not the film itself, which some will find a little tepid.The problem is that the film is just not as funny as it wants to be. So, you feel like all the cues are there for you to laugh: there's Eric Idle's goofy face, there's the pause before the punchline, there's the inevitable joke. But the clever touches are somehow only halfway clever enough, so there's very little oomph to the laugh. The overall concept is fine; one can only wish that Idle had put the script and gags through a couple more drafts to get the most out of his material.So, my advice, for what it's worth, is to buy the first Rutles CD (which is wonderful). But rent the film before you buy it.-"
4,Still holds up after 30 years,The Rutles is a must for any Beatles fan -- a brilliant parody/tribute that still plays very funny even after three decades.
4,"The Rutles ""Rock""","If you are a fan of the Beatles, Monty Python, Spinal Tap and A Mighty Wind, take all of these, roll them into one and you have ""The Rutles: All You Need is Cash."" The song parodies, and video footage is ""spot on"" with the history of the Beatles. There are great cameos by people like Mick Jager and Paul Simon, which add to the ""realism"" of this ""Mockumentaty."" Great movie to add to your collection if you love this genre."
3,All you need is to be a Boomer.,"Funny if you remember ""Beatlemania,"" but over the head of most everyone else. I've shown this film to younger friends and my own kids, and none of them get half the gags. Still, if you were around in the mid 1960's and want a good laugh, this film may be worth checking out."
4,Great for Beatles Fans,"This made-for-TV film predates the mockumentary ""This is Spinal Tap"" and surely influenced Rob Reiner's effort in style and form.Some of the jokes WILL NOT be understood by casual or non-fans of the Beatles. So much comic ground is covered- Brian Epsteins sexuality, Harrisons fascination with all things sub-continental, Allen Klien, and the Yoko factor to name a few.The music is good enough to fool some untrained ears, very derivative but actually sometimes hummable in it's simplicity and so similar hooks. Nice cameos from people who may not be regarded as important as they were when the film was made."
4,Very funny--and well thought out,"When watching this movie, the more the viewer knows the Beatles, the harder he will laugh!! Eric Idle (of Monty Python fame) did just and excellent job researching to put this together. You will see a lot of familar faces, like Glida Radner, and even George Harrison!"
3,Idle Treatment of the Beatles,"It's more of an affectionate tribute than a parody of the Beatles. Neil Innes's music so perfectly captures the Beatles style that, even when he's not directly lifting one of their songs, the music's verisimiltude is dazzling. He's really the whole show here, despite Eric Idle's dual role, because his songs contribute all the highlights and the most enjoyable moments. It's clear that the four ""Rutles"" and their guest stars - most of the late 1970's SNL crew, Mick Jagger, George Harrison, and Michael Palin - are enjoying themselves. But the film isn't very funny and the script isn't too relevatory. It's amusing in the sense that children telling jokes or playacting are amusing: we enjoy watching the actors enjoy themselves (they're acting out a fantasy of playing the Beatles and got their own Beatles music to boot) - I smiled throughout but never laughed."
2,Only a few laughs,"I enjoy Monty Python and I am a big Beatles fan, so I was surprised I didn't like this movie. Basically, there are only a few laughs, and they weren't specific to the Beatles so it could've been put in any mockumentary. What also disappointed me was there was not much interaction of the Rutles - you don't get to see them talk to each other much, which could've provided many funny moments. The song parodies weren't that funny, either.What I did like was the visual aspects of the movie - they really did get the look of the Beatles throughout the years pretty accurately. It was also good to see many of the original Saturday Night Live cast and they provided much of the few funny moments in the movie.If you want to see a funny mockumentary, check out ""Spinal Tap"" and ""Fear of a Black Hat"". Both movies have two necessary ingredients that this movie lacked: hilarious banter between the band members and funny lyrics in the songs."
2,Simply not funny,"Unless you are over 35 or a big fan of the Beatles (i.e. familiar with most of their work) you will not find this funny. Not even remotely comparable to works like Spinal Tap. I sat there just waiting for clever jokes but there were only a couple. The lyrics to the music are just too plain - really lacking jokes.Maybe rent this one from the library, but you can save the money - you'll see my copy up on ebay soon."
5,great Book,This book is great! It gives you lots of tips on how to grow a successful city garden. I give this book 5 stars because it is so exelent.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS STOVE!!!,"This stove design is very good in theory, but when they made it they did not test it. The air vents need to be much bigger. Even when fully open, the creosote builds up in the stove pipe so fast that it chokes off the chimney. Chimney and spark arrestor need to be larger to accomodate the smoke. You cannot make a fire small enough to keep smoke from coming out of the door when you open it. Don't let the apparent great design fool you. This stove is terrible."
1,Don't let the looks fool you,"I too made the mistake of purchasing this stove/heater. For the first 3.5 hours the 8 man tent was filled with smoke (toxic?) from the sh***y paint that was not heat resistant. After 50% of the paint fell onto the ground the thing could not keep a fire going, vent adjustments are too limited and flue is too small. The flue is lacking a damper and lets all of the hear go out the top. I too had the issue that when I opened the front to add a log the smoke filled the tent and gave me a headache and then went out @ 4am since after 6 hours of constant tending it couldn't keep a fire going on its own. I used it once, I will be throwing it away. Complete waste of money. Don't let its good looks fool you."
4,Clever beyond words,"Charlie Sheen returns for part 2 which is basically a send-up of Rambo with T2, Seahunt, Apocalypse Now and Kickboxer thrown in for good measure. Sheen's Topper Harley is brought in to rescue prisoners from Irag, including several other rescue parties that got captured trying to rescue the original prisoners. Lloyd Bridges is hilarious as the president who never quite knows what's going on. Sheen does a good Rambo impersonation and they have Richard Crenna playing the same father figure role he played in the Rambo movies. There are site gags galore and clever wordplay. So much goes on you have to watch it more than once to catch everything."
5,CLASSIC COMEDY!!!!,"HA! THIS MOVIE IS REALLY FUNNY....The first HOT SHOTS is good, but this second part makes me really laugh!!!One of the best moments of Charlie Sheen..."
5,Great Movie!,This movie is sweet. Very funny when your drunk. I would watch this movie everyday if i didnt passout from drinking at the stip clubs.
2,Ho hum,"Oh, there were a few funny gags here, but mostly this is pretty low-brow stuff. Part of the problem lies with the fact that Sheen is not a comedy actor."
3,Not Connie Mason's usual awesome fare!,"The story has been well outlined and is pretty much your typical western fare. Man with issues + woman with issues = romance with issues. The difference is the adorable little boy, Abner and how much he and his mom have to endure. It was a nice, pleasant read but I thought it dragged in the middle. Then end chapters were very good. Hoping the 3rd of this series will be better.(p.s. hero Chad is a hunk and a sweetheart)"
3,Good But occasionally Wishy-washy,"This wasn't a bad sequel to ""To love a stranger"" but it was not as strong as the first one. The antogonist was forboding but was not as all imposing as the first one. Overall It was a good read."
4,"Hero, finds woman in need, and is doing the right thing","This book is quite good, however not one of the best I read. The heroine Sarah Temple does not live an easy life as a single unmarried mother in an unforgiving town when Chad Delaney shows up and, reluctantly, resques her from her hard life."
2,Superficially developed characters with litte feeling,"This is a wonderful series of books covering the civil war from the Southern viewpoint through the eyes of a Yankee sympathetic to the Southern cause through highly stretched circumstances!!! Superficial at best, enthusiasts will be left wanting. When one knows the author is British, one wonders why he would try to write this historical fiction when he has no feel for the genre...and it shows; it lacks feeling."
3,"Yeah, big whoop","I read this book in mostly to find out what happened after the first installment. It was decent, but I find the author's generalizations of humanity unrealistic. Sure, we may fight constantly, but any casual glance could tell you that we can do more than make war.He's written better, but it was still a nice read."
5,"Genetic, psychic, and underrated.","This book, second in The Damned series, takes place during the war. A group of aliens that look similarly like humans find they were geneticly changed. They turn against the creatures that did it to them and are helped by the humans. When helped, it is found that they have gained psychic abilities. The False Mirror goes through the pain of being betrayed and the harshness of war. Foster creates many different types of aliens, each with a distinctive attitude and personality"
4,The False Mirror,I've been a fan of Alan Dean Foster for a very long time and I rate this 3 book series as one of his best. It's right up there with the Flinx series.
3,Where the hell is Sweet Thing?,Good compilation. But in MHO it is missing the best song and my favorite sequence from the film.Sort of a let-down.
5,Moonlight mile soundtrack,CD arrived in perfect condition. Great older less heard song that haven't been played to death.. I would recommend this to anybody.
4,Great car music,"Saw the movie, loved the music, bought the cd, first time purchaser on Amazon, very happy with service an cd. The music reminds me of my childhood, it's great to listen to your favourite artists performing less know works. Highly reccommend this cd if you like the artists. Some tracks are a bit scratchy but mostly very easy listening."
3,ok soundtrack,"considering they didnt put what i feel is the most defining song of the movie, Elton John's ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"" (the song for the trailer)."
4,Instrumental,Buddy- I don't have the title but it's very similar to the music on Silberling's other film-City of Angels. Perhaps it is the same composer. Hope it helps a little bit.
4,"Sounds great, but........","I have only recently watched moonlight mile and even now I havnt seen it all the way through. I have watched it all mixed up! The film is full of emotions. I have been listening to the sound clips to see if I recognise any of the songs, which I do. The main ones I remember are:moonlight mile-the rolling stonesrazor face-elton johnbuckets of rain-bob dylanThese are the three main ones I recognise the most since I have not seen the whole film!however, one of the MAIN songs I do remember, that is not on this cd is calledsweet thing-van morrisonI was humming this song after watching the movie and I cannot believe it is not on the soundtrack for this film! really it is so part of the film and a tune which really stands out!The whole music is emotional and moody, and has a romantic feel/sound to it. A definite to listen to in a car, or as summer tunes.cant wait to catch the rest of the songs in the film.......Priscilla x"
1,Worthless,"We actually waited for the toilet to be clear before attempting to use this (It clogs every day), and we were hoping this would push through whatever must be further down the pipe than the plunger can help with. All it did was get jammed about 6"" into the toilet's drain. HOPELESSLY JAMMED! There was nothing to prevent it from moving forward except the u-bend of the toilet, and apparently, the broad knob at the end of the auger was too large to take the tight turn. The more my husband and I tried, the more the ball-shaped knob at the end became crushed and twisted, but it never would take that turn through the tube. What a waste of money. I can't believe I paid extra to overnight this piece of junk."
2,Singer that can't control her voice,"Decent hard rock bar band with a female singer that can't control her voice. When she nails the note, she can sound as good as Nancy Wilson (Heart) in her prime. When she doesn't, which is more often then not, there's hell to pay. The EP is presented as a live recording, so hopefully things will be cleaned up a bit with the studio release."
5,Great Album,I am not much of a writer but this CD is just excellent.Songs to pay attention to:- Better Sorry Than Safe- I Get Off- Innocence- Love/Hate Heartbreak- Bet U Wish U Had Me BackThere is some resemblance to Heart but a bit harder.By all means buy it !!
5,Space saving.,"I love this item,it leave some extra space for my mirrors,speedometers and my bike lights.I would recommend this to my friends."
5,Works with recumbents too,"I wanted a way to mount my Sigma computer with my Windcheetah recumbent trike, as the handle bar area is tiny. The flexibility of the Topeak Bar Extender worked perfectly and I can now see how fast I'm speeding around town."
5,Works well. Easy to use,"I use this on my recumbent bike to mount my Garmin Etrex. I mounted it to the left side of the handlebar, out of my line of vision and where I can easily reach the Garmin with my left hand. With a little practice I angled the mount and articulated the post so that the Garmin is pointed toward my face so I get minimal reflections back to me and can see the display day or night. This has held up fine for the 600 miles or so I have used it so far and stays in position, but I think that it might be a mistake to mount something much heavier than the Etrex on it."
3,"It does what I expected, but I need another 2 inches.","It does what I expected, but I need another 2 inches. I cannot seem to find a longer one."
3,TOPEAK BAR EXTENDER,THIS IS A PRETTY COOL DEVICE AND CAN BE USED MULTIPLE WAYS. IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT WITH OPTIONS. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE I SAW WITH THIS IS THE DIAMETER IS KIND OF LIMITED AS TO WHERE YOU CAN PUT IT. IF YOU HAVE A BULKY STEM IT MAY NOT WORK ON IT AND SOME METAL MAY COME IN CONTACT WITH THE BIKES FINISH/PAINT. ITS GREAT ON SMALL/THINNER STEMS AND HANDLE BARS. THE PICTURE SHOWS THIS WITH DOUBLE LIGHTS WHICH I WAS LOOKING TO DO MYSELF AND COULDN'T ACCOMPLISH THIS DO TO THE STEMS SIZE(DIAMETER) UNLESS I CHANGE IT. I DON'T LIKE IT GOING STRAIGHT UP OFF THE BARS JUST TO PUT 2 DEVICES - FOR THAT I WOULD JUST USE THE ACTUAL HANDLE BARS AND KEEP THAT OTHER STUFF OUT OF MY FACE UNLESS YOU PUT IT FACING FORWARD AWAY FROM YOU AT AN ANGLE SIMILAR TO THE STEM.
5,Works very well,"Used to mount GPS and cycle computer above Ortlieb handlebar bag on our tandem. Worked precisely as described. It is simple, rugged and stable. Good design."
4,Good flexible extender,"It is easy to install, and it is the only flexible extender in the market. I am using it to mount my two lights on it. This is my second one that I bought. First one broke after 6 months of use. I have a mountain bike and travel 50 miles daily obn it. Most of gadgets that I buy for my bike last about 6 months and so due to the abuse thay taqke. if you take care of this extender, it should last you a long time."
4,Does exactly what it is supposed to do,Yep it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It fits nice and secure and it has many different angles and positions so it is very versitile. The only thing i would change on this product would be to put some kind of barrier at the end of the handles so things won't slide off.
1,broke on first ride.,"I put the bar extender on and thought it was great with all the ways it can be adjusted. Then, toward the end of my first ride with it (~2 hours), it just snapped. The shiny chrome-looking bit connecting the base to the bar extension appears to be metal, but in fact is cheap flimsy plastic. I'm just glad I was less than a mile from home and my computer wire and air zound tubing kept it from falling into my wheel. I didn't think my air zound horn bit, cateye strada cadence computer and small headlight were too much weight, but I guess I was wrong. Do not waste your money on the cheaply made piece of junk."
5,Well Designed Light and Cyclometer Bar Extender,"I mounted this bar extender under my handlebar stem down in the front so that I could mount a pair of USB rechargable LED headlights lower to the ground and of of my handlbar cockpit.It can be used in a T-shape or a straight bar configuration.Once you get it installed with its clamp, its on there rock steady. Now worries. Have 500 plus miles with this xtender installed. has not moved. Very happy."

2,Broke on me,"Purchased in July '12. Worked nicely for some time, but on a ride today I hit a bump and the stem snapped at the mount along the weld. An attached light and cell phone went skittering over the pavement. Maybe I had it overloaded, but I don't consider a bare Samsung Galaxy Nexus 2 and an LED light overkill. I'll try the Minoura next and see how that fares."
3,Good idea but poorly designed,"This product is a good idea for all of us who like gadgets on our bikes but don't have the room. The big design flaw is that unless you have straight handlebars you are unlikely to be able to mount your gadgets in a level position. It does allow for changing the position but only at preset increments of 30, 60, 90 degrees, etc. So, I took off the nut and reversed it and it allowed me to lock it down on any angle. So far it is working well. One of the things I do like about this extender is it allows you to extend in different directions; up, down, forwards, etc. Another is that it fits the design of a bike and almost looks like a factory part. I mounted twin planet bike led lights on it and it looks awesome and is very functional."
5,Works Great,"I have an old school mountain bike with narrow handle bars and very little room for accessories. I did have space to mount my computer and two of these bar extenders. They are very flexible in their mounting location and angles. They can adjust to almost any position you want them. I needed to mount 4 headlights and these two bars worked out great. They actually allowed me to mount the lights higher and farther forward of the handlebars. You can easily fit two headlights on each of the bar extenders. They are easy to mount and adjust even after placement. The only thing I would recommend is using an old innertube or rubber shim to help hold it in place and provide a more secure mounting. Without the rubber shim, they tended to shift on my handlbars, but after putting the shim in, the problem was solved. I highly recommend them if you need to mount headlights and such on bike."
3,Not Topeak's best effort,"I own many Topeak products and have generally been very satisfied. While the Topeak Bar Extender is useful and has a versatile design, it falls short of the standard set by their other products. The method used to attach the Topeak to your handlebars is not the best. I had to use lots of rubber and really crank down on the Allen wrench to keep it from slipping. The angle of the extender bar is also adjustable - a very nice feature - but again the method used falls short. The adjustment method does not secure the bar in a fixed position. I use mine for two headlights. On a bumpy road or trail, I have my lights flopping up and down just enough to be really annoying.The bottom line is that the Topeak Bar Extender has a clever design that offers a lot of flexibility in how it can be used, but it suffers from some design issues that frustrate when trying to install and adjust it."
1,Another Poor Design,"Once again, Topeak has another product with a design flaw. I could not get the mounting base that attaches to the handlebar to tighten properly. In fact, the metal strap actually deformed and simply wouldn't stay tight. Maybe I did something wrong but I seriously doubt it. As with their handle bar bag, they seem to have a problem with mounting brackets. They LOOK nice but form follows FUNCTION! I have a lot of Topeak products on my bike that I would highly recommend but they really have a problem with handle bar mounts. I noticed that most of the other reviews for the Extender were favorable but I had a very bad experience with mine. So, just make sure you keep your receipt."
4,Works for me - not perfect,"I waited a long time to pull the trigger on this purchase. I was looking for the perfect way to mount a few more things on handlebars that weren't really conducive to mounting anything. I didn't find the perfect solution, but this extender is good enough. I have two headlights mounted on it. The initial installation was fairly easy, and I found the flexibility with adjustments to be quite adequate. The only annoyance is with the stability of the headlights mounted on it. The mounting bar itself doesn't have a great mechanism for holding things in place. The lights slip down once in a while after going over bumpy spots and such. I have the lights cranked down pretty tight, but they still don't stay in place all of the time. I can pull them back up and they stay in place until the next big bump. It's not ideal, but this bar does make it possible for me to have these lights on my bike at all, so I'll take it."
2,Did not work on my handlebar.,I struggled with this a long time trying to get it to work on my riser mountain handlebar and could not get it. The main problem was the extension could not be adjusted level with the ground and pointing forward. It has some limited coarse adjustments but nothing to suit my handlebar. Another problem was the diameter of the extension was too wide to fit my Planet Bike Blaze headlamp. Also the clamp must secured to an even area of the handlebar -- if there is any taper the thing will slip.I'm giving it a generous two stars because it looks like it may work in some applications and once adjusted it sits quite solid. Also the concept is a good one.
4,Well-engineered product,"Just installed this on my bike and already have dual Bell iPulse LED Bike Torch headlights attached to it. A quick spin around the acre of property shows that it won't shift over the bumpiest terrain I put the bike through. The installation wasn't intuitive as this was my first experience with the item, but let that NOT be a reflection of the product. I think it was a well-engineered and well-made, durable product which I will undoubtedly count among my best purchases."
4,Great illustrations!,"I own a lot of knitting books, and in my opinion this one has the easiest-to-follow pictures of any of them. I would highly recommend it to any beginning knitters. The book isn't encyclopedic, and some of the patterns are a little dated, but you can come away from this book with a good understanding of most fundamental knitting skills."
4,"Good beginner instructions, but projects are quite advanced!","It seems a little strange that a book titled ""Basic Knitting"" would include mostly sweater and vest patterns--several with cables. Very few of the patterns would be easy enough for a beginner. The instruction in the first half of the book is great, but it will be a long time before I'm ready to tackle a sweater with cables!"
5,Best Knitting Book,"I originally purchased this book in 2006. It is a difficult book to find and a friend was new to knitting. I purchased this copy for her. It is one of the best books to have when learning how to knit. Great instructions, great visuals, and some nice projects to play with. Great for a Beginner"
2,"great for presentation skills, not for promoting a seminar",The title could be misleading...don't be confused. This book is great for discussing skills needed by presenters. It is not a how-to book for designing or promoting seminars.
3,Corporate Workshops & Seminars 101,"I purchased this book based on all the glowing reviews. I wish I could tell you I am as optimistic. I felt the author offered a straight forward common sense guide. Get this book if you need to confirm you are doing an effective job. If you are in the corporate field you may find this book more helpful. For non-corporate seminars and workshops, I'd skip this one."
4,Great example of what comics can do,"I've read several of Jason's books. Perhaps ""read"" is the wrong word; they are generally almost wordless, relying on his spare, precise drawings of highly ""schematic"" anthropomorphic animals. Most are tales of hurt, alienated people.""The Iron Wagon"" is quite a departure. It is a word-heavy comic book version of a Norwegian mystery story, set at and around a resort hotel where the lead character is vacationing. There's a murder, than another; a detective comes to town and digs up family secrets and odd local legends.Overall, a satisfying tale that, though populated with talking rabbits and birds, has a charming turn-of-the-century flavor."
4,This is a great CD,A variety of feelings and mostly original work on this CD. I can't believe he plays this stuff on the bass (isn't he missing 2 strings?). I can't get September out of my head it makes me feel so good!
5,We haven't bought it yet.,"I am looking for his Brian Bromberg ""Magic Rain"" cd. I know it is no longer being sold, but any ideas where I can get a copy? I need to find it, and have had no luck."
4,Bromance!,"This korean movie is so sad, but so romantic at the same time. The subtitles are fantastic and the video quality is very good :) I highly recommend that each person should watch this film!"
1,terrible movie,"This movie has some good parts, but the disturbing ending makes it seem more like a very bad dream than any form of entertainment. When one person is trying to knock unconscious the other and then bury him alive, they have no business together in the end ! It was a terrible image and movie !"
4,Toypedo review,This is a great swim toy. My sons love it! I have seen other toys like this but we liked this one better. It spins under water when you throw it.
4,Great toy for SCUBA & Snorkeling Classes,Just one thought this toy is not like a nerf toy it is made of hard rubber and is designed to be thrown underwater. I teach SCUBA & snorkeling classes. Most of my students (adults & children) love tossing the toypedo around. By it self it has limited educational value but it is an excellent teaching aid for Snorkeling and SCUBA.
1,dangerous,This is a very dangerous toy. I'm a lifeguard and I have had two head injuries by kids using these toys. One of them had a very deep cut from the tip of the torpedo and ended up getting stitches. Definitely not an okay toy.
2,disappointed,"I am embarrassed that I sent this as a gift to a relative. What appeared to be a hard rubber toy when I bought it turned out to be nothing more than a styrofoam ""Nerf"" toy. I have questions about its durability as well."
1,Sized wrong,Have tried to contact seller to no avail. The toilet seat is beautiful but sold as a standard size. It is not! supposedly adjustable but it is not. The seat will not stay up because of the elongated fit. Very bothered that the seller will not respond.
4,Lacan can be easy...If you read the man yourself!,"If you want to read Lacan, forget all the confusing introductions by people like Zizek, Gallup et al. And absolutely don't bother with ""Ecrits""--they're dense rewritings of earlier speeches. Instead, begin where it all began...the seminars, Paris, the 1950s. A who's-who of Paris intelligentia are here to listen to the new kid on the block with an intriguing new back-to-basic reading of Freud. Lacan here, in transcriptions from his class, asks only one thing from his students: do your homework. If he's going to talk about a particular essay by Freud, he expects you to read it. You get group presentations by the students, plus Lacan's sardonic asides. Great fun."
3,"Good for engineers, bad for scientists","This book explains all relevant aspects of database systems, but in very informal way. It can be used for introduction of different aspects of databases to people that are not interested in theory, but in praxis of databases. There are some new aspects explained, such as data mining, object-oriented databases, ect. But there is no formal propositions nor proves of anything in it. So, from scientific view the book is worthless."
4,A considerable change of style,"Now this album, released in early 1987, is moderately O.K. The track 'Jet Airliner' shows a considerable change of Modern Talking's style. It isn't as good as the other featured singles of Modern Talking's 1980's era, but I would never call it bad. This track is more 'trance' oriented with a touch of 'Euro - disco'. The track 'Charlene' is also made of a similar style and it is good too. The best track of this album is 'Don't Worry'. The worst is 'Blinded By Your Love'. If you're very fond of 'rock' music, then the track 'You And Me' should be your choice for the best track. Also, the track 'Like A Hero', is without any percussions ! It is still the best ballad of this album. This just shows that Modern Talking is an evergreen band."
4,Romantic Warriors!! Unusual work of Modern Talking.,This is truly a great album! I would give this album 4 out of 5 as I will that Dieter made a foolish decision by putting only one song a single! 'Don't Worry' and 'Romantic warrior' should have been singles of this album and 'Jet Airliner' doesn't compare to those two tracks! I don't know why he did this but 'Jet Airliner' is a good track but I feel it shouldn't have been a single. Modern Talking explores Rock with Disco and many tracks are also like Rock. 'Don't Worry' as a heavy metal guitar right at the end which is super and I feel in this song they have the highest pitched voice in their career. 4 out of 5 brings music to my ears!!!
4,Saturday Night Live comes to life!,Some of my favorite actors portray their best SNL characters in this movie. It has been a long-time hit in my family and I was just dying to finally own it because its never run on television anymore. It was a blast to see this again now that I am in my late 20's and able to understand some of the humor that I never got as a child. I recommend this to anyone young or old.
3,Classic comedy based off a classic TV show,"This is a great comedy. That's all I can say about it. Great comedy. See it, it's great."
3,Excellent Service - Wrong Region,"There was a kink here as I did not know and it was not listed but, Region 2 type DVD do play in the Americas as a Region 1 does. Had to return this product but, hopefully I will get a replacement with a Region 1 so I can add to my movie library and enjoy the antics of the Coneheads. Still waiting for this issue to be worked out."
4,My Dad Loves this,"I bought this movie for my Dad and he just loved it. We had been searching quite a while and everywhere for the movie; Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, etc. and none of them had it in the store or on their online sites so I was very happy to see it on Amazon and for a reasonable price. Thanks for making my dad laugh!"
3,not what i expected,im not sure now what this product was rated but it was definatly not in the condition that it was said to be in...the case was fair and the dvd the same...my daughter has not told me of the quality of the dvd yet but i was dissapointed in the shape of the case.
1,did you all really pay $69 for this ? haha,"i love the movie but its not worth that much, you can find it at least for $20 IN STORES"
2,Coneheads (region 2),"I tried, but could not find out what ""region 2"" in the title meant. When my uncle recieved the movie, he discovered it would not play on a regular DVD player, but he needed to have internet connection to view it. He does not have internet. It took a long time to get to him. He was so disappointed, and I then he had to pay postage to send it back to me, I had to print a mailing label and pay to ship it back to the seller, and am still waiting for my refund, which does not include these charges. Sellers should tell in the discription of products what limitations there are in the product they are selling. It was a gift I wish I had never purchased."
3,Consume Mass Quantities!,"Graduating characters from sketches on Saturday Night Live to a feature-length movie is not new; but the timing was fascinating for the big-screen reprise of the family from the planet Remulak.Released in 1993, it seemed like the period of comedic relevance had passed by Beldar (Dan Akyroyd), Prymaat (Jane Curtin) and Connie (Michelle Burke). But armed with a neat movie tie-in with Subway, cameo appearances by many past SNL cast members and a script heavy in cartoonish skits, Coneheads was clearly pointed in the direction of a fun romp.Michael McKean and David Spade are the stumbling and bumbling antagonists, in their roles as officials of Immigration and Naturalization Services. There is a good dossage of special effects, but the monster, Garthok, steals the show in all of its low-grade madness.The main characters may have lost a bit of their edge from SNL, but that isn't the point; Coneheads keeps it light with laughs, while not taking itself too seriously."
3,"Great movie, but missing scenes","This is a great movie that I remember watching from when I was a kid. Dan Akroyd and Chris Farley really know how to put a smile on your face. The only thing that I find wrong with this movie is that there are missing scenes. It seems to be skipping particular scenes that I remember. One that stood out was after they return home to Remulak, they are eating green stuff and drinking. While watching it, they don't include that in the DVD. Either I got jipped, or they just didn't bother to include it."
5,Is all good,I always get my used movies from Amazon.com and never have a problem with them. Coneheads is part of my Sci-Fi movie collection. It is an amazing movie and one of its kind. I recommend for you to own this Sci-Fi comedy.
3,underrated,"despite the negative reviews, I laughed out loud alot during Coneheads. And the movie is a fairy tale of sorts...despite their VERY obvious differences in appearance & mannerisms, the Coneheads were still treated as equals by their neighbors & friends, and they were able to live in (relative) harmony & mingle amongst the rest of society. Only in the movies! But, it did give the movie a warmer feeling than your typical screwball comedy IMO. Dan Ackroyd is hilarious, and Chris Farley's role makes me miss him even more (not to mention the legendary Phil Hartman, too). I think Coneheads is worth watching...it's nothing heavy, just a breezy but very humorous movie..."
5,Awesome with one disappointment!,I could watch this movie over and over. It has the humor most movies don't have today. There was only one problem. There are parts in the original movie theatre version that are not on the tape. But I do highly recommend it!
4,Funny movie,"Very funny and entertaining. I had seen it before, but that was a long time ago. Forgot how funny it was (especially the chewing gum."
3,A very peculiar movie!,"Well what can I say! It was very difficult to get a handle on this one... throughout I felt like I just wanted to feel one way about what was going on but ended up feeling neutral or unsure or downright weirded out about every scene. Maybe that was what the producers were going for? I haven't seen the SNL skits this is based on, but I guess you could say it was like that -- every scene was like a skit and they wanted to thread them all together -- and in that respect you could say they succeeded. Check it out if you're looking for something different!"
3,Yeah,"I like this movie, but I dont love it. It has a great cast and everything (Dan Aykroyd is the best ever!) but it just wasnt what I expected. I saw it in theatres when it first came out, and I wasnt too fond of it, but now that I have seen it a few times, it has kind of grown on me."
3,VERY GOOD COMEDY!,"""Coneheads"" is a very well made comedy, with Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, David Spade, and Chris Farley. The plot is original, with cone-headed aliens trying to adapt with surburbia, their daughter dating a human, and trying to decide whenever or not to go home. Rated PG for adult situations and mild violence."
4,One Of My Favorites,"This is one of my favorite movies for sitting back, forgetting everything else and enjoying the silliness and parody of our everyday lives in this lightly satirical comedy. It features some of the best talent of it's time. I have purchased this movie in every format it's ever been released in. A real hoot time after time and enjoyable to watch repeatedly in the same way Caddyshack or Christmas Vacation are. A must-have and a real value at its usually discounted price."
3,Better on TV,"The Coneheads seem a lot less strange in the movie than they did on Saturday Night Live. The movie Coneheads don't continually freak out unsuspecting visitors or do anything of that sort, which is what they always did TV. When the Coneheads first started out on TV, you'd see someone visit the Conehead house, get freaked out by the weirdness of it all, and (usually) run away.Oh sure, there are parts in the film where people get freaked out, but no one runs away, so the Coneheads actually start to blend in. When that happens, the Coneheads just aren't as funny. Also, I think the higher budget of the movie and its elaborate storyline took away a lot of the goofiness that made the original Coneheads so great to watch."
4,Funny,It was just as funny as the first time I started seeing the skits on Saturday night live back in the old days!
1,nothing against the movie..DVD doesn't work,"I purchased this a year ago, for my 7 year old, its hard to find in stores...and it has some kind of licencing issue, I guess it only works in European DVD players..disappointed"
1,NO GOOD IN US,I can not watch this dvd! I have never heard of region codes. I got this as a gift and he was so excited only to find out it would not play in the US. I was extremely upset with this dvd. I would have liked to have been warned about the region codes.
2,Annoying,"I saw this movie when I was 10 I thought it was tolerable, I saw it again on tv a few years later and it was worse than I remembered. There's probably 10 seconds worth of comedy in this, the rest is stupid. Good parts include Chris Farley with the mating hat, and where the daughter conehead scarfs down a foot long hogey lickadysplit. The stop motion creature was pretty cool too."
2,This movie came out when I was in The third grade,This movie came out in nineteen ninety three ( 1993) - I was in third grade back then!! when I was younger it was sometimes harder for me to tell the differnce between real and fanasty because of the fact that was very autisic back-then; now I am 21 and more higher-fuctioning--- and I know for a fact that Aliens and UFOs aren't real... because they only exist in science-fiction- However Connie (Michelle Burke) seemed to respent what most teenagers feel... by wanting to fit in with her peers.
4,BIZARRE DISASTER FLICK,"Perhaps the CGI effects are too gimmicky and some of the acting a little stiff, but VOLCANO DISASTER has some unique twists in its storyline that elevate it anyway. A young volcanologist (well played by Chris William Martin) loses his wife in a volcano eruption. He had promised her on the day of her death that he would accompany her on a trip to her homeland in Italy, which he does after her untimely demise. Once there, he meets a strange girl who has some kind of mystical connection to his dead wife. The villagers think she's demented, but it seems she may have some kind of warning for the young widower. The supernatural overtones help fill out the otherwise routine plotting, but the volcanic eruption at the end is well staged and involving. Not bad for an unknown low budget film."
3,The Exorcist Meets the Ghost Whisperer Meets Volcano,"This movie tries to have something for everyone. Take one cup of ""The Exorcist"", add one cup of ""The Ghost Whisperer"", combine with two cups of ""Dante's Peak"" mix and bake and voila, you have ""Volcano Disaster."" If you're a dedicated disaster flick fan you'll probably find this one mildly entertaining.It takes reasonably predictable disaster film elements and combines them with unexplained supernatural elements which results in a less than usual predictability for the overall film. The movie was good enough that I watched the entire movie without giving up in despair. In all honesty I'll have to admit I give disaster films more latitude as I am a fan of disaster flicks.It will probably be a long time before I watch this one again and I would recommend you see it before you buy it. If you're an avid collector of disaster flicks you'll probably want to add this to your collection."
2,"Okay, but I wouldn't pay alot for it","My mom and I love to watch natural disaster films, so I got this one on a whim. As a movie, it's actually not too terrible, but it didn't have a lot to do with the volcano itself, so I was disappointed with that. In fact, the volcano is barely mentioned. It's one of those side story kind of movies. I did't pay much for it, so not too bad."
1,The Volcano Disaster,"Sucks. Sorry I bought it. Thought it was a disaster flick, it was way out there in some realm that didn't come close to ""science fiction."" It's not worth the cd is recorded on."
2,?,"this movie was awful. i thought it would be about a disaster, but aparently it was about a mute girl who speaks to the dead. it turned out ok if you knew what it was about but if you were looking for a thriller this isnt it."
3,Unpredictable Quality,"Our first order of this was fresh and tasty. We also enjoyed the versatility of switching out the noodles for brown rice, and tossing with sauteed chunks of chicken breast with either broccoli or fresh spinach. Thought we had a winner.But then, an order arrived with two of the noodle packets punctured with the noodles growing green, fuzzy mold all over. Disgusting.Then the most recent order, June 2012, arrived with rancid sauce and rancid peanuts unfit for consumption.Now we're not sure if we're game to try our luck with these any further. Probably not.As the for the spicy heat some people mention--it's really great, and we actually add a few drops of ""hot"" seasoned sesame oil right right before serving to make it even hotter, more intense and more enjoyable.The problem is the unpredictable quality control."
4,Great for a fast lunch,"At work we have a break room with hot water, and this makes a quick good lunch for me."
4,Pretty good!,"Bought this at the supermarket because it was on sale. Very pleasantly surprised! I think it tastes as good as any standard take-out joint. Good flavor and texture with a little kick. The prep is a *little* more complicated than your average microwave meal, but definitely worth it."
4,"Good product, just to high priced.",I love Annie Chun's products. They're just a bit expensive for only 6 bowls. I would suggest getting them at the store if possible.
1,didn't like it,"I love annie chun but this particular soup just does not do it for me personally, however you may love it. The soup has a very unusual taste. I really wanted to like this soup but I will stick to the other flavors that I love."
5,Great quick noodle bowl,"This one and the Miso noodle bow are favorites in our house. Both are mild kid pleasers. This one comes in at three times the calories of theAnnie Chun's Miso Soup Noodle Bowl, 5.4-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 6)though. Its a very hearty serving size, and is a slightly sour sauce. My son likes an extra spoonful of peanut butter stirred in -- I totally second K Vandette's review, the quick way, start with hot water I use our insta hot tap) microwave for a minute, stir and add the other ingredients and microwave for another 30 secs to a minute.Tastes great and is super fast for your kid that has to get some place with minutes to spare :-)"
4,Pretty good... worthy of 4 stars,"These are easy to make in the microwave but do require opening 4 separate packages of noodles, sauces, peanuts, and flavorings. It taste pretty good, good enough for 4 out of 5 stars. I would consider buying them again."
3,"Tasty, but...","Nice flavors, plus, noodles weren't sticky but, for us, the upset of post-prandial indigestion was a killer...ruined the day!"
2,Changed Recipe ruined a great product,"I have bought these numerous times over the years as a 'backup' quick lunch at work if the need arises. Frankly it was my favorite flavor since I tended to vary the noodle flavors I bought over the years for variety. But this last order convinces me I wont be buying this flavor again. What once was a good ""Peanut Sesame Noodle"" is now a horrible ""Lemon Noodle with peanuts"". They changed the recipe for the peanut sauce and it's now just overpowering lemon grass. I don't expect fine dining when I get these, but I do expect edible and it's nearly not."
4,Pretty tasty and filling.,"None of these instant bowls comes anywhere close to fresh local food, but this one is not bad at all. Though a bit more fuss to prepare than some, it's worth it, as this bowl definitely tastes better than most I've tried. Also, the whole bowl is enough to satisfy a man for lunch or a quick dinner. However, high in caloroies and sodium, so I would not eat them too often. (The package says that a ""bowl"" is two servings, very misleading, but what can you do? So remember to double those nutritional numbers!)You get enough peanuts to matter and they tasted good. The sauce was good. The ""cook and rinse with hot water"" method they use means the noddles aren't too oily like some I've tried. And the bits of vegetable, while sparse, help some.Easy to make, noodles are very good, tastes is good, price is fair. Thumbs up!Update 2012-02-17: These have gone up in price since my review."
3,Peanut Sesame Noodle Bowl,"I was initially excited to buy this product as I love noodles and peanuts. However the noodles are disappointing. They are clumped together in a separate packet but the noodles do not separate well and tend to stay together almost doughy or gluey. First I made them according to instructions and was disappointed. The second time I put the noodles in boiling water first and that helped a bit but was still problematic. I later added the noodles and the other packets to sauteed vegetables. The taste was really good, but the problem is the noodles! Maybe dried noodles would be better as they would not stick together."
3,Fatty! Caution. Compare to Simply Asian,"This particular Auntie Chun's has 20 grams of fat, 5 grams of which are saturated fat.This is not much healthier than Nissan fried Ramen.Simply Asian noodles have 1 gram of fat! One gram per whole serving! And the servings are the same size, and the taste is just as vibrant and lovely as this Auntie Chuns. I, personally, won't be buying Auntie CHun's again, and wanted others interested in nutrition to notice this startling difference.Quality of product and taste is same, essentially, Auntie CHuns and Simply Asian. I get the Teriyaki noodles or the Pad Thai Simply Asian.Healthy living to you all!"
2,"Edible, but not very good","You can easily make your own by boiling some spaghetti and adding some scallions, cooked diced carrot, soy sauce, broth, and peanut butter, along with some ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Annie Chun's is a poor substitute for homemade."
3,Best in Bass,"The rap is not all that on here but the beats hit hard. DM Records will always be, ""The Best in Bass""."
1,Unreal!,"Who ever put this CD together should be shot! How do you take a classic song by the treacherous three like Gotta Rock, try to sing it over and think itll sound good? Where did they make this CD, in a bar? THIS AINT KEREOKEE you clowns!"
1,Fantastic movie awful DVD,"Eros should be ashamed of themselves for destroying this beautiful movie by cramming such a poor quality, badly authored dub onto a DVD5. Amazon is doing itself no favours peddling such shoddy substandard merchandise. The movie is all about beauty but the DVD is ugly and ruins the beauty of the story."
4,Works pretty well,I wear my hair very short and have a lot of trouble getting it to look as good as my hairdresser does. She recommended one of these so I would have better control over using a bulky hair dryer. I do a much better job but still not as good as her.
2,Too hot,The hot tool is too hot. I don't use it that often...the air and the barrel gets too hot and can easily burn your skin if you are not careful!!!
1,Curl release button doesn't work,"I specifically bought this brush roller/hair dryer because of the tangle-release button. Straight out of the box, the tangle-release button didn't work, not once, not ever. The amount of trouble it's going to take me to re-package it, re-box it, and return it, is not worth it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,Curling Brush Lover,I have used the Hot Tools curling brush for several years. I love the ease of use and the wonderful results on my fine straight hair. My hair never looked better. My only problem with the product is that it does not last more than between 9 months and a year for me. They lose power and smell hot. I have tried other brands and haven't liked those as much.
4,Almost Great,I really like this product. The 1 1/2 size barrel is perfect as well the heat setting being enough to get the job done. The only issue is that in the last couple of years since I have found this product and use it ... the heat element burns out quickly. I have used/gone through about 2 to 3 a year. This time I have purchased 2 so that I have back up when the first one dies. I do have fuller heavy hair and that could be why the heat element burns out more quickly.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,The brush bristles are very short therefore does not hold the hair as you try to blow dry. Heat is acceptable but gets hot at the tip so you have to be very careful are you will get burned.
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I ordered this product to replace another hot air brush I was using. I have worked in many salons where professionals have used Hot Tools products so when I read the reviews I didn't hesitate to purchase this. Upon receiving the product and opening the package, I immediatley thought it felt cheap. It is only 800 watts and it took forever to dry my hair, which is not very long or thick. After using it twice it stopped woking and smelled like it was burning. I wish I could return it, don't waste your money!!"
1,caution-gets hot in wrong places,"Using this for drying and curling hair is nice, but the tip gets pretty hot. I have another brand that does not have this problem. My grand daughter, age 9 loves this brush but I had to get her a different brand because of the brush having hot spots. I wouldn't recommend this product, there are others for a little more money that work better and don't get too hot to the touch."
3,"Not great quality, but potentially a good product","I had a similar tool in France which was GREAT, but unfortunately i could not bring it to US because of different electric system. So I bought this tool online, it looked similar to my French brush. The quality is definitely inferior - gets too hot, doesn't have much choice of spead/ heat setting; is noisy, and I have an impression it contributes to hair breakage more than other tools I have used... I use it on the lowest setting, in the absence of a better tool, but would gladly switch for something better as soon as I find it"
1,Broke after one week!,This product was a HUGE disappointment. When styling your hair you can easily burn your fingers and it stopped working after I used it for about a week! I returned it to Amazon!
1,This HOT TOOL fried my hair.,"I purchased the Hot Tools 1073, Hot Air Styling System, 800 Watt. I used it less then a minute and it was in motion during that time. I could smell my hair burning. I turned it off, waited a few minutes and I decreased the switch from high to low. Once again I could smell my hair burning. I'm assuming the product is defective. The Amazon 30 day return policy has just lapsed: win some, loose some. I also bought a Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron and it is great."
2,Worked well for a while....,This product did work well for a while but it only lasted about 1 1/2 years before burning out.
2,Not satisfied,"Mine lasted through about 10 uses and then would not even turn on. I have semi-thick, wavy hair and I don't think it did a very good job drying and styling at the same time, at least for my hair. I need a more powerful dryer."
3,It does not release that easy,This product is okay. The release feature is not that good compared to another old hot air styling brush I had. It is kind of loud but not too bad that you can't stand it. It doe its job.
3,good for bangs but thats it,this is nice for blow drying small parts of your hair like your bangs. it doesnt work for anything else though because the bristles are very short
3,Decent tool but not what I expected,"I miss my Revo rotating hairbrush :( and found this when I was looking for a replacement. For some reason I thought it rotated. Since the reviews were good on this product, I decided to try it. It's okay but I still have to basically dry most of my hair before I use this or I'd be all day doing my hair. My hair is frizzy and moderately thick and it did not control that at all. It's a good supplement but don't throw out your regular hair dryer."
4,Nasty! Nice!,"""the sensuous man"" Sounds like it was recorded on forty tracks of digitally demented dictaphone - And that's a good thing! Twisted, twisted, twisted songs that dare you to like them... and you will. Just don't sing them out loud in your office. Strictly for under the covers with a flashlight. Nasty! Nice!"
3,That's One Dense Book,"This is something that should have been written in 200 pages or less by HK. Instead he drones on and on for over 600. A lot of it is just his opinion and I doubt that it could either be proved or disproved by anyone. For that matter I don't think it would even be applicable to any of the situations that this country could face during Cold War. For a much better book on the topic consider ""Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy"" By Henry Kissinger."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The material was well thought out, but I couldn't get past all the outdated references."
5,A must listen!!!,"A Canadian classic rock icon of the 80's has come back with an incredible new CD. Although Harlequin's lineup has changed (the CD is listed as Harlequin II), the project highlights some of Canada's best talent, including bass master Spider (Kim Mitchell, Tom Cochrane, Streetheart, Loverboy), Murray Pulver (Crash Test Dummies), and of coure George Belanger, the original frontman. You won't be disappointed! There is a song on this CD for everyone, and George has never sounded better. Great production!"
2,so so,"I found this book rather simplistic. It may be good for someone who has never had kittens/cats growing up. I didnt agree with the part where the author says arching the back and fluffing the tail shows aggression, maybe in the wild but my kitten does that all the time when hes just playing. I think many topics were just touched on,would of enjoyed more detail but again if you are familiar with kittens its not going to tell you anything you didnt already know but for someone who knows nothing about them it will help,hence the name I guess."
4,Excellent information for beginners,This book has plenty of information to get you started on your journey with your new kitten. I think there are some areas that could have been a little more in-depth but it is on my coffee table and is referred to often!
5,Fantastic Book!,This is a great book for anyone with a new kitten. I have had kittens/cats for many years but when I got my new kitten I decided I would read up on them to see if there was more to learn and this book has taught me so many new things about kittens that I never knew before. I highly recommend it!
4,Good book from Amazon,KITTENS FOR DUMMIES is a good book for a new kitten owner or as an update on new information for a long time cat owner like me.
5,Book,I could not have done it without this book. It was such a help that I have given them as gifts with positive feedback
1,Doom and Gloom,"I have had cats since I was very young. Recently, my husband and I brought in a 6 week old kitten. I have never raised an indoor kitten that young. I wanted a reference on how to riase our kitten not to be a terror. This is not that book. I typicaly read before I go to bed. I had nightmares. If you want to learn about all the different ways your kitten can die with examples, you might enjoy this book. This book is also not well organized. It seems like every other paragraph they are refering you to another chapter. Not good writing. Overall, I would recommend passing on this purchase."
1,Hack cat hater tries to cash in,"How much mercenary gaul can a hack journalist cram into one thin book? There's not much evidence that Mr. Wren has ever liked cats, ""Henrietta"" included. True, he admits as much in the introduction (well, that makes it alright), but the few genuinely affectionate details come second hand from his children, who should be writing their own books, not his. When Mr. Wren isn't subscribing to a general I-hate-man and-beast facsimile of humor, he finds time to:1) Complain constantly about Henrietta's upkeep2) Begrudge her a redemptive talent for eating house rats (paying her board I guess).3) Eat a cat (yes, a cat) at a Chinese restaurant (but he didn't tell Henrietta, *giggle*)Read carefully and you'll see that Mr. Wren really wishes he'd abandoned Henrietta or his book contract or both. Maybe someone should pay a real cat lover to write the travel/cat book he wouldn't."
2,Not for cat lovers,"Do not give this book as a gift to a cat lover such as myself. Henrietta's first owner only had her because she never bothered to spay her female cat. Instead of responsibly finding good homes for the kittens, she placed the kittens with anyone who would look twice at an offer of a bottle of scotch (and cheap scotch, at that). Mr. Wren adopted the cat as a thoughtless and last minute Christmas gift, a common way animals end up in shelters. He goes on (and on) to explain how he tried to get rid of the cat so he'd be free to travel. I didn't get much past that, but I take it they lost the cat several times in foreign countries, and who knows what the poor thing went through. I work for a humnane society and see too many animals neglected and subjected to such misconceptions as contained in this book."
2,Not particularly interesting or amusing,"I'm sorry, but the anecdotes in this book are not nearly as interesting or amusing as the premise would suggest. The stories are generally along the lines of ""my cat sat on Andropov's lap"" or ""my cat ate from KGB trash cans."" And more of the same. Sorry, although this sounds like such an adorable book, it does not live up to expectations."
1,mmmm....,"It doesn't fit at all... leave an space between the borders, and it is big at the bottom, because it is less than a millimeter greater than the original stereo hole, i have to install it with glass fiber and polish, paint and cover with vinyl...."
3,You ain't jivin'!,"Here I thought I'd discovered an unknown writer -- Ha! Turns out that Al Young is a poet, a novelist, a creative writing teacher, and a genuine intellectual (check out his website, which is easy to find).Snakes is Al Young's first novel, featuring African Americans in Sixties Detroit who speak a colorful version of English and don't have too much hope for the future. Drugs, music, and even a little bit of sex are included, as this is the story of a poor but honest lad who becomes a pretty good guitar player.Definitely a readable book, but it won't change your life. It's worth it, though, to learn about a man called Al Young."
4,Powerful poems,"Hayes is a man of power. His poetry doesn't act upon flowery language or the use of a thesaurus. The power lies in the emotional restraint and outlet. My personal favorite poems are the ones focusing on the music of the past. He pegs David Bowie down pretty well.Many of the poems are racially charged, further enhancing the emotional impact of this book."
3,Experiments in sound...,"This book of poetry tackles real situations and race issues through symbolic repetitions of nouns and verbs. Moreover, copious modern allusions help hammer blunt political outrage. Best of all, conversely, there are pretty turns of phrase that alliteratively bathe the reader in wordplay. The overriding metaphor: the title of the book itself (several of the poems employ that resounding nom de titulo)."
3,Personal Comments About Developing Distribuited Applications,"I found the Rational Rose diagrams in the book soo useful with very clear example and good tips to mapping classes to tables but when I read the code I found very serious mistakes, overall in the business and data access components. First the data access component don't return the correct value when you use a query to insert or delete a record (use records affected to return a correct value) e.g. Cn.Execute MyQuery, ConnectionString, retVal. Finally, the parameter are variant in the function getInfo and you read and skip nulls for each record, If the table has 20000 records! your application probably frozen. You should use a by value recordset and to skip nulls you should make code in a COM component. e.gtxtFirstName.Text = objNull.SkipNull"
5,"A facinating film that examines the important relationship between doing what's right and ""honor.""","This film takes place during an uneasy time of peace in the early 1600s in Japan, and centers on a man that asks to perform Hara-Kiri in the courtyard of a high ranking lord, and is told the story of the previous man that asked to do the same. The story, and how it unfolds, is as masterful as ""Rashomon"" and twice as beautiful. The film's dark tone is conveyed perfectly through the dark color scheme and somber music. But the most stand out aspect of the film is the sound work in one key scene that I will not describe, because any insight into what happens would lessen it's impact. But suffice to say, the film is something not to be missed, especially if you love films such as ""13 Assassins"" or ""Seven Samurai."""
1,10 yr olds with Plastic Swords,"OMG - even ""The scantily clad Princess Tritia of Blue Land"" can not save this movie.Perhaps more scantily clad princess warriors that are less clad would help the ogle factor but the movie would still be absolutely pathetic."
2,Good if you like cosplay,"I have not seen many of the Asian ""B"" movies, so I am not sure if this is pretty standard fare or not. Acting is, well, lacking. Seriously, it's one big long cosplay movie. About two thirds in it, the girl gets tortured several different ways, I thought that was to much S & M, I fast forwarded past all that. No woman should be portrayed that way for that long in a film. What's the point?Sorry, but if they cut this down to about 5 minutes on youtube, that's about what it's worth.I like Scifi, but this fails at that genre."
3,Drill Bits...,How excited can you get over some meadioker drill bits. They are not top of the line and not crap!! They are ok for a home owner for do it yourself projects around the house. Not a bad price as well.
3,Another Chinese tragedy,"I like watching Chinese movies to understand thinking and culture, but this is typical of a Chinese movie in terms of real entertainment value. It's another tragic story, so don't expect any feel-good vibes at the end."
3,"A well-made, but flawed, cultural portrayal","This film was beautifully filmed, and the acting was, for the most part, excellent. Gong Li did not live up to her usual brilliance, but still did a very good job portraying the character she was given. The problem lies in the character she was given. This film is exemplary of the mistaken attitude of China's intellectuals about ""peasant consciousness."" Chinese intellectuals, even those who sympathize with the peassants' wishes, tend to think of the Chinese peasantry as being backward, simple and childlike. This perception stems from resentment of Mao's centralization of the peasant during the Cultural Revolution, but as such is nonetheless invalid. The movie is interesting, at times entertaining, but for the most part not an accurate portrayal of life in China's countryside."
2,A real disappointment,"I love this man's films - from Ju Dou (an early classic) up to The Road Home (saw it yesterday in the theater - beautiful...), but this one is really a bummer - none of the sweeping visual style or strong emotion, but lots of wandering around experiencing the dull, uninteresting pain of bureaucracy. Perhaps there is a China-specific commentary being made here that is of interest to some (most of the positive reviews here dwell on that), but if you like Zhang's movies for their more universal themes, don't disappoint yourself by watching this.If you've only seen one of his films and are interested in more, make sure you've seen Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern, as well as the lesser heard-of Shanghai Triad, which will also satisfy any Gong Li requirements you might have."
3,Just so-so.,"in this film, not a lot happens at not a great pace with some good understated acting. Its kind of relaxing but it lacks the amazing cinematography of something like 'Farewell My Concubine'. Maybe I missed the point but I found it a tad long winded."
1,The Story of Qui Ju,"We originally saw this movie through Netflicks and liked it so much I ordered it from Amazon. That was some time ago.Last night we played it for the first time for some house guests. What a mess. From nearly the first frame it skipped and froze continually. Large sections of the story just disappeared in a flash....It was so bad one could not follow the plot, even though I had seen it before.Then, two thirds of the way through, the thing just quit altogether.The whole marvelous ending with the new baby and the arrest of the chief...the sad lesson to Qiu Ju about pushing things too far...totally not there....nothing niente....I was so disappointed."
3,A search for justice in Communist China.,"This film shows Gong Li's acting ability. If you are purchasing this video with hopes of seeing Gong Li's ravishing beauty, you will be disappointed. She is blandly dressed and pregnant through most of the film. In this film, she is a farmer's wife in search of justice within the bureaucracy of the Peoples Republic of China. Stubborn and relentless, she repeatedly pursues an ""apology"" from the man who harmed her husband. Along the road to justice, she meets many nice people who offer practical advice. But she does not heed them until it is too late. This film is interesting but, if you love Gong Li, try Temptress Moon or Raise the Red Lantern.LouinDC"
4,One of the best albums,"'In the Middle of Nowhere' is perhaps the best album by Modern Talking to date. I has hits like 'Geronimo's Cadillac' and 'Angels sing in New York City'. There are also some slow and soothing songs like 'Give me peace on Earth' and 'Stranded in the middle of Nowhere'. On the whole, a good collection."
3,In The Middle Of Nowhere 1986,".This album isn't as good as other 1980s albums, but I like some songs -02 Riding On A White Swan04 Sweet Little Sheila06 Lonely Tears In ChinatownThree singles were released:Geronimo's Cadillac (+Keep Love Alive [on 12""]) - Oct.1986 Hansa 7"" 108 620, 12"" 608 620Give Me Peace On Earth (+Stranded In The Middle Of Nowhere + Sweet Little Sheila [on 12""]) - Dec.1986 Hansa 7"" 108 778, 12"" 608 778Lonely Tears In Chinatown (+Give Me Peace On Earth) - 1987 Hansa 7"" 108 838, 12"" 608 838P.S. The following album (""Romantic Warriors"" 1987) is much better!."
4,Seems to work,"Seems to work, what else can one say about a coffe pot cleaner. Vendor got it to me very quickly."
3,Clean the machine,"what can I say about this coffee cleaner, it was costly but wanted what was recommended for our new Krups coffee Machine."
4,Stand out in a crowd,"Soul is definitely not a shy fragrance. It's floral, but not in the typical sense. It's more woodsy in nature, along with more exotic flowers like freesia and water lily. Like the previous poster said, bamboo is also a main component, so it's certainly not your typical fragrance. It's a warm, sexier type scent, and the bottle is pretty cool, too."
5,Beautiful!,"This scent is soo beautiful, light floral and sweet!! I am so happy with my purchase. It smells like a very expensive bottle of perfect and for the price you can't beat this! Reminds me of spring and summer by the blooming sweet garden fields with a nice hint of sweetness and light aroma. Warms the soul ++++++"
4,like it,lovely and sweety smelling. I think this can be worned everyday.Not regret buying it since the price it not expensive.
2,too strong,The scent was not what I expected. It is also very strong. I recommend not more than 1 spray. Lol.
4,Bunraku,"AWESOME MOVIE. This movie was Kill Bill, Scott Pilgrim, Sin City all rolled into one. Even if you arent a fan of anything other than kill bill, you probably will like this. It reminded me of the cheesy karate movies from when I was a younger, but with a funny and cool twist. It was edgy, creative, funny and FULL of action. It was so creative, we were very impressed.LOVE the fact that I didnt see any nudity and only remember a few cuss words, which is rare in movies nowadays. They feel that if we want action or to laugh, they have to stick boobs and butts in our face or use foul language throughout the movie....not so with this one.We laughed and were wowed throughout this movie."
4,Fun Movie,"Fun story, great acting, cool action! A good movie to pop a tub of corn and enjoy with a tall cool coke."
5,Such a great movie,"Movie arrived on time, in brand new condition. Boyfriend loves the movie, and I was happy to find it for such a great price!"
4,Cool movie.,"I liked it quite a bit. It had a comic-book movie meets old-western and old-samurai film feel. All in all, solid purchase for people who like that kind off genre."
5,What is this???,"I just watched in Blu-ray this movie. Make a movie like this is not for everyone! Great visual, a mix of a lot of influences, great interpretations, great scenes, great music. Few scenes are weak, maybe when they go to the camp. Must watch!!!"
2,Feels like it was filmed on a stage,"I picked this up as a rental and could hardly make it all the way through. It feels like a stage play, all artsy and full of unusual sets. But the actual story is weak and feels like a series of pasted together moments. If you're in the mood for an interesting visual experience/experiment, try it out. If you want a good action movie, don't bother."
1,Can a movie be this Bad?,"I just don't understand how people with millions of dollars, with able actors like McKidd, Demi Moore, Harrelson, Perlman can produce such BORING, repititive garbage!? Sword-fight after sword-fight, bare knuckle power beats up many, many, many bad guys; and always for the right reason (something about freedom?), etc. The visuals grab you at the beginning; the comic-book scenery back to live-action is interesting for about 10 minutes, but nothing changes in this dull, 1-dimensional no-brainer. There is NOTHING of any interest to hold your attention."
1,Cheap looking Sin City wanna-be.,"The film attempts to follow in the visual story telling of Sin City, 300, The Spirit etc., but fails. The story line and the acting leave a lot to be desired. The movie is full of popular actors, but no stars. You recognize mostly what I can only guess are out of work actors. This is a typical Saturday afternoon made for cable movie."
1,Wretched,"I sat through this at a film festival last year and everyone in the audience I spoke with afterward agreed that this may be the one of the worst films of all time. It is boring, moronic, and clueless. The only thing it has going for it is a nice visual flair... which gets you through about ten minutes. Everyone involved in the making of this atrocity should be ashamed. I can only believe the good reviews on here are from plants... and I don't mean studio plants, I mean potted plants, because even studio shills have standards."
5,"Awesome! It's like ""live"" Anime!","Watched ""Bunraku"" last night. I think it is awesomer than awesome! The animation is stunning, and combined with live action, is pretty incredible. Yeah, I know there are lots of movies that do that, but the art style and the physical sets are beautiful. I've read some really negative reviews for this film, and I don't think they get it! It's a ""graphic novel"" style movie, but the best one I've seen. You could pause on any frame of the film, and it looks like a graphic novel. The lighting and art direction are spectacular. It's like ""live"" Anime! So ignore the reviews, and watch the film!"
5,A page-turner.,"I recommend buying not only Dead of Night but also The Killling of the Saints, where Abella introduces his character Charlie Morell. All the right elements, passion, underworld figures, ethnic elements, are masterly weaved by this skilled writer. If you want to learn about the early days of the Cuban Revolution, read Abella's historical novel, The Great American, packed with solid research."
2,Not what I expected!,"Mr. Abella definitely lost me on this book. Perhaps it was the fact that I never read his previous book in reference to the main character. I was genuinely impressed with ""The Great American"", and was expecting more of the same type of storytelling. Perhaps I expected too much."
5,5 star review,"The book ""Immortal Longings: Meeting Jesus Along the Way"" is a book that shows great intellect about our religous faith. It is not just a textbook format of religious facts, rather applied to everyday life by a terrific author who has a million stories for everything. It is a book that allows your thoughts to keep wandering even when you are done with the book. It is a book of reality and highly reccomend it to anyone!"
3,Too little too late!,"Yeah, ok, maybe, going outside and doing something is the answer to all this CRRRRRRRap!"
3,"Worth the money for a refurbished, not a new one.","First Dewalt saw I have owned, and not that impressed. I know it's not the most expensive one out there, but it doesn't seem anymore powerfull than a Ryobi 14 amp saw ($70) I own. The Ryobi also has a laser and overall nicer saw. The only reason I bought the Dewalt was because of the price since it was refurbished. If you can get it for $70 it's worth it, anymore than that, buy something else."
1,yet again,"yet again, not available, wrongly described, out of stock,the list goes on, shopping on amazon a nightmare use you as a last resort!!!"
5,Perfect for the drive,I drive about 35 m. one way to work. This is perfect. You will be in a great mood when yo get there.
1,Shine needs to Re-Born,"""Born"", Bonds first album, was an incredibly inspiring and amazing album: varied, passionate, deeply enlivening. ""Shine"" is the opposite; repetitive tunes- uncreatively commercial and superficial; simply mediocre. Considering ""Born"" one of the best albums in my library, Shine was a total disappointment. I wasted $18 on an album I could't bear to hear more than once...what a contrast to their other work!"
1,For kids only,"When I was a kid we had this kind of kitsch, called ""Hooked on Classics."" It was inspiring and a lot of fun. But, I was a bit shocked when I got to music school and learned that Dance of the Sugar Plum Faeries didn't immediately jump into Lt. Kije.There's no way this album would please a lover of real classical music. It's puerile to an adult.I'm not against anything that's good for music education in the aggregate. Maybe buy this for the kids if they like it. Then gradually introduce them to the real thing as they get older... maybe get them some lessons too."
4,Shine Review,"I thought Bond's new CD was going to be better then the first CD but it wasn't. I found it more techony than the first CD and there's not much complicating parts like in the song ""Duel"" from the first CD. As a figre skater, I was hoping to skate to the second CD becuase too many skaters already skate to the first CD. But there are only a few songs in the second CD that are skatable. The melodies of the songs are ok, but not as good as the first CD (except for the re-written songs). Overall, I do like the second CD, but it's not as good as the first CD."
4,Great music,"I fell in love with bond's first cd-born-and when I found out that a second was in the process of being made I was estatic! I was hoping for something above and beyond born. When I got the cd and played it, I was not disappointed. However, upon closer listening, I did feel let down in a way, it wasn't as good as I thought originally. But listening to it more, I have fallen in love with it. There are a few cuts that I prefer over the others. (personal favorites: cut 6 and 3)I loved the first cd because they showed their talent (rather expertise) of their instruments and had fun. I felt, at first, Shine was a push to make rather than taking the time to enjoy the process.None-the-less, it is still good driving music and worth the price. But I hope they will listen to the fans when they come out with the third. Good Luck Girls!"
3,Classical with a Modern twist,"I purchased this c.d. for my husband. He loves it, but I like their other c.d. ""Bond"" much better. This one seemed to have a greater ""pop"" sound to it and not as much depth to the music."
4,Cool Music!,"I like this album. I am really into classical and I like some pop, but listening to this CD is like listening to a classical and melodic trance mix Cd mostly dominated by the classical part though. It's great. One thing that I hate though is that these girls's alubm cover is packed with sexuality...totally unnecessary...leave that to those who don't have talent and need that appeal to sell their stuff. Seriously. I got the CD for the music not the pictures, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one!"
3,Not Up to Previous Standards,"I eagerly awaited this second effort from Bond but wound up being a bit disappointed. It seems flat compared to the excellent BORN and the girls' talents get lost in too much background music and extraneous noise. Drum machines should be outlawed. Some great tunes, but the mastery is lost in the poor mix."
3,A Great Concept WAY Over Done,"As a fan of Bond and of Born, I was anxious to hear the new CD. In the midst of enjoying the music, I stopped and listened closely, trying to hear the strings. On a couple, I heard none. When I did, I could not be sure whether it was the girls or their backup orchestra. In an interview last year, one of the ladies expressed a wish that their next album could be more pure strings, without such heavy production and electronic overload. Clearly that did not happen. I still enjoy the CD, but I find myself imagining how frustrated the girls may be with their work being drowned by synthesizers and techno noise."
3,"Over-produced, not as good as Born","I love their first album, still listening to it weekly a year after I bought it. Their second album on the other hand I can tell I won't be listening to nearly as much. It's way over-produced, too many drum machines and special effects. I bought this CD to hear them play, not hear them accompany an engineer playing. This album reminds me of any one of a hundred ""Dance Mix"" CDs I've heard. It's better, but it's definitely reminiscent. Their first album was much more original, I'd give that one 5 stars without question."
3,Was a little dissapointed,"Was expecting a little more from this. Though they have allot of albums out, so they must have a good following. I just didn't find the music to my liking. I do like Lindsy Sterling, Fleetwood Mac. Five finger death punch, so I have allot of different genres that I listen to, this one wont be one of them"
2,I like their first CD better!!!,"Granted sex sales.... forget about the CD cover and the pictures inside... now how about the quality of music... I could hear their violin much better, much clearer from their first CD ""Born"". In this second CD, there are a lot of background music, digital effects, etc. that made it difficult to hear their violins. This CD is a bit too commercial. The background effects masked the ladies' true talents in violin."
4,Close and almost perfect,"I had really high hopes for the release of ""Shine,"" and the girls were only a chord off the scale. I think that the girls played magnificently; it was the first song that made me want to skip it. Some Euro DJ has decided to remix ""Allegretto"" / ""the DeBeers Diamond is Forever"" tune into some [weak], synthisized beat. I can't stand what they did with that, so when bond came on with it, I almost wanted to turn it off. All their tracks are full of the energy and renaissance of classical music.Their music expresses so many emotions, but all put you at such ease and state of relaxtion, it's the perfect choice for any stressful situation. My favorite track is either Kashmir or bond on Bond.If you found ""Shine"" a masterpiece, then ""Born"" will blow you away!"
5,Complaint,"The CD is wonderfulL. However, since I have yet to get reimbursed from the returned ""2nd"" CD I received, I will not be ordering from Amazon again. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE CD BY NOW!and since Amazon collected the payment, Amazon should credit my bankcard."
4,Cheers to the girls.,"Well I came into this CD with an open mind, not knowing anything about the 'band' and not knowing what kind of music to expect. I was pleasantly surprised I have to say. I'm a big fan of electronica as well as eastern and classical music. I have a very eclectic taste and I think that this CD appeals to each of them. For what it is, I like it and I recommend it if you like a little technology with your strings."
3,I miss the old Bond,"This CD was a bit of a let-down. As the other reviewers has pointed out the album seemes to focus on the wrong bits of the band. Most of the time you can't even hear the quartet very well. They get drowned in the background arrangement.The best songs on Born were the ones with little or no background arrangement. But instead of making more songs like that they ended up going in the opposite direction.Not only isn't there a single string instrument on any of the pictures in the cover, but many times there doesn't seem to be any in the music either. And then what's the point of Bond?Still if you are a fan it is probably worth the money, but if this is your first time buying one of their CDs I highly recomend going for Born instead."
5,The Diva's Can Play,"I was astonished by their masterwork together. This is my first CD and my first time being introduced to them and I find their music is wonderful, vibrant, young, and absolutely fearless. Please take some time to get to know these ladies and fill your home with the sound of strings. They play with a strength of a bull. I am very pleased. I am going to try their other music as well."
3,"Great violins, repetitive and unimaginative synth...","Just bought this mp3 album after hearing ""Big Love Adagio"" on Pandora. I've listened to it a couple of times, and unfortunately the songs become almost tiring to listen to after the first go through. The violins and cello sound wonderful! However, the synthesizer is repetitive, at times sounds very cheap, and is often under-developed."
5,Bond Shines Another Day,"Fans only had to wait two years for Bond to punch out another Classical/Pop/Dance album. The finished product is some of the string quartet's best work. With the return of violins, a viola, and a cello, these instruments provided the basis of Bond's Classical music sound. But to acheive the full sound of Bond, the electronic instrumention for Pop/Dance music returned as well. This time around, Bond dove further into the Classical genre and arranged pieces to match their own sound. With a name like Bond, the string quartet also performed their version of a James Bond Theme entitled ""Bond On Bond"", and it landed them a spot to the score and soundtrack for the film The World Is Not Enough. With the release of this remarkable record, it was clear that Bond and their new form of Classical music would not diminish.Stand out tracks include:""Allegretto""""Shine""""Fuego""""Speed""""Gypsy Rhapsady""""Bond On Bond"""
1,Redundant Hangups,This book starts off with some interesting ideas. Super heroes based on mythology. Quickly she overuses phrases such as 'frowed his brow' and 'licked his lips' so much so that it is laughable and equally irritating.Every emotion seems to be explained at one point or another by 'licking ones own lips.' The sex scenes are also ridiculous and not a very good idea (many little organisms live in saltwater).This book has moments of adult reading stewed in with writing styles more appropriate for the 'Babysitters Club' series.Though this book will be the last Kenner novel I open; I really blame the editor for allowing much of this material to ever see print.
5,Outstanding biography,"Having now finished all 2000 pages of Churchill's Marlborough, His Life and Times (books one and two), I would like to encourage those with a love of history - especially military and political history - to make the attempt. Churchill's prose is wonderful, and the story of Marlborough's diplomatic and military leadership in the War of the Spanish Succession is fascinating and compelling. I note that one reviewer preferred book one over book two, as Marlborough's greatest military victories are told in the former. I found book two to be equally fascinating, as Churchill describes the vicious English internecine political strife that destroyed the anti-French alliance, nearly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. If you think 21st century American politics are divisive and ugly, read book two and you will feel better."
4,Wonderful......,I recommend this music for anyonegive it a chance and see whatgift it bestows upon you.
1,"No Japanese, false advertizing by Amazon database",The DVD was advertized as having Japanese. No Japanese anywhere possible with it and was the only reason I bought it. Be warned when it comes to Amazon's listings of DVD's having Japanese. A LOT of these are incorrect!
3,"Not as good as the earlier shows, too much slapstick.","This pokemon show seemed to stress comedy rather than the serious theme of the earlier shows. Relying on slapstick throughout with little effort given to further character development of story telling. We will still buy the next shows, but this does not bid well for the upcoming movie."
4,Ride The Train,"The Captain & Me finds the Doobie Brothers perfecting their unique sound. The most famous track off the album is the classic ""China Grove"". The song kicks off with an instantly recognizable guitar riff and then moves swiftly through to a beautifully harmonized chorus. While not as famous as ""China Grove"", ""Long Train Runnin'"" actually charted higher and became the band's first top ten hit. The song peaked at number 8, while ""China Grove"" stalled at number 15. """"Long Train Runnin'"" also has a great guitar riff and is longer than the more concise ""China Grove"". These two songs are the album's obvious standouts, but aren't the only things the album has to offer. ""Natural Thing"", ""Without You"", ""Clear As The Driven Snow"" and the title track are all strong tracks. The album itself was also their first top ten album, peaking at number 7, and started a streak of 8 consecutive top ten releases."
2,"Get the CD, not this.","This is a great album, one of my faves, but get the CD instead. The MP3 version sounds like the guts have been ripped out of it with almost no bass....worse than other MP3s I've heard."
3,Captain & Me by Doobie Brothers,"Captain & Me by Doobie Brothers - Another good Doobies early albumn. Not my favorite of their library of work, but I still listen to it on occasion."
5,"If you are ""hooked on"" the 70s... Get this album","The Doobie Brothers... High School times... The first parties with your friends... The harmonica sound on ""Long Train Runnin'""... If you loved 70s American Pop & Rock music, you can't miss having this album in your CD collection (P.S. Get also ""Toulouse Street"". You cannot appreciate the Doobies great Rock music, without having both of them!)."
5,The Captain and Me showcases a mature band,"I guess you would call me biased when it comes to The Doobie Brothers but what the heck. IMO, they are one of the greatest American rock bands in history and belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame which has snubbed them forever. Eagles, CCR, Beach Boys but no Doobs. Shameful. The Captain and Me was their third album and is a masterpiece for sure including the classics 'Long Train Runnin', 'China Grove' and 'South City Midnight Lady'. Buy it, listen and you'll love it"
5,Multi-Channel fun,"I own the DVD-A version of this recording. If the SACD is anything like the DVD-A, then you're in for a treat. You must get an SACD player to be able to get the multi-channel goodness on this SACD. I have an Oppo player which will allow you to play either DVD-A or SACD (and DVDs and CDs). Anyway, this is probably their best album. Many hits, and even those that were not ""hits"" are great tunes. And, the engineers did a wonderful job in making this a great multi-channel album."
2,If it aint' broke don't fix it.,this record was never broke. Ted Templemen produced an incredible sounding rock record. And these guys remastered it. They added a lot of bass boost. You can barely hear the the Doobie Brother snare drums and hi hats. But the original.
1,Dreadful sound,"This sacd sounds just dreadful. How can MOFI release such crap? I'm really angry that they boast about fantasic sound, etc, when the sound is just muddy, no high, no low end, no nothing.MOFI really has lost the plot. Nor just this release but all the latest releases. They most use the wrong equipment or something. The records they release sounds dull with no snap and no dynamics. I sugest that we as consumeres tell them and protest by sending them e mails telling them this."
2,Not 5.1 Surround,"The SACD Original Master Recording - I contacted Amazon by e-mail before purchasing, and they could not tell me if the SACD layer is surround. Unfortunately, I had to order it to get that information. The SACD layer is NOT surround, and I don't know why Mobile Fidelity would release it that way. I have to return this disc.As of this writing, Amazon has the description for the Japanese SHM version here, and the reviews are from different versions."
5,Great memories,"Remember when bands played a big variety of sounds? Even on the same album? If you can remember any of the tunes on this disc, I think you'll find it worth playing once in a while."
3,Doobie Brothers / Captain & Me DVD-A,Better than the CD release but not great by any means. I believe they could have done better...
1,no disc,"I'd love to write a glowing review of this product. The package was as seen in the photo, but the surprise was that the cd was NOT included. So my review of this seller is that he, she, or IT is a ripoff and should NOT be trusted. I paid $30.00 dollars for a picture of the album....and I HAVE the album. 0 stars and NO thumbs up!!"
4,The best of the doobies,"I think people need to hear this album again and find out what masters these guys were. True Rock without MM effing them up. A hint, Doobies with MM are not the doobies, but rather a backing band for a corporate rock machine, NOT a bandthis is a band, a great band."
5,Hybrid Super Audio CD playable on any CD player.,"This is a numbered Limited Edition Stereo Hybrid Super Audio CD playable on any CD player. However, to enjoy the superior sound of the Super Audio CD layer of this disk a Super Audio CD player is required (do a search for an OPPO universal player).This Mobile Fidelity release of one of the best records of the 70's is given their typical gold disk treatment. The sound on the Super Audio layer is superb. By far the best sound ever of this album."
3,Better than most with similar design,"The wood on this gate is much thicker than other designs I have seen. This makes it a great option if you're dealing with dogs or toddlers. (We have both). The non-pinch top is good, easy to install unit, works. Height is perfect, width more than adequate, and it's just flexible enough to install in odd places. I recommend it. I doubt however it is something that could withstand more than a couple of years of being beaten by dogs and kids. Packaging was horrible, but item arrived in one piece with all its parts."
4,Super easy to install.,"The price was right. However, it's not for chewers or a big dog that really wants out. My dog chewed right through the wood, but I glued it back together, using popsickle sticks, and haven't had a problem since."
5,My personal favorite!,"A Book Dragon is a fabulously written story about a time in which dragons were as common as wolves are today--""Here there bee dragons."" I first had this book read to me when I was in fourth grade and I absolutely loved it! I have been trying to find a copy of it for years. It is a story about a dragon named Nonesuch who becomes able to control his size. He finds treasure to guard in books. This is a wonderful story for all ages, and best if read aloud."
4,Lots-O-Fun,"How To Meet Cute Boys is definitely in the marshmallow-fluff category, but everyone needs a little junk food now and then. The writing was smart, hilarious and fast-paced, and the little magazine 'articles' were clever and almost too cutesy. The only thing that annoyed me is that the heroine takes her desperation and worry toooo far. It kinda got old, but all in all it was a fun read. Looking forward to the author's next endeavor."
1,this gives chick-lit a bad name,"From the beginning it's hard to tell where the story is going. There's so much self deprecation on the main character's part it was depressing. There's not one hint of strength or self love. I also have to comment on how I annoyed I was with the character referring to her mom as ""The Mother"". It's ridiculous. I can't say enough how much I disliked this book."
1,"Good Story, Bad Ending","The story line that deanna wrote was good. it showed issues that seemed real, and it wasn't your average book, but the ending stunk. It wrecked the whole book. it seemed like the author ran out of time, and added junk at the end. i wouldn't recomend buying it. if you really want to read it, get it from the library, because it's not worth the money"
2,leaves you hanging,"This book was a fun beach-type read. At first. I enjoyed it and was looking forward to seeing how things turned out. The author doesn't wrap up anything that happens in the story, which was a major disappointment. Consider yourself warned."
2,Shallow and insipid,"Writer and editor Benjamin Franklin (a name that unto itself is gag-worthy) seems to have the perfect life. Except, she spends her nigts at parties hoping to find someone to replace the hole tat her ex boyfriend Jack left. Enter Max, who seems like the perfect guy... until he turns out to be seven years younger than Ben. When she tries to get him to commit to a relationship, the predictable happens--he runs away. The plot spirals downwards from there, leading to NOTHING. That is, as other readers said, the book had no discernable ending!The characters, Ben included, are all shallow--there were numerous places in the book where I just wanted to scream at Ben for acting as dumb as she acts. Sure, the games, quizzes, and little bits of trivia are cute, and serve to distract from the fact that the book has no substance. Definitely a miss."
4,Listen to the book on tape and crack up.,"I ""read"" this book on tape and found it to be hilarious. The book was good and the narrator was just perfect for the part with very amusing voices. I would recommend this to my girlfriends."
3,Clever story - weak ending,"I thought this book was very clever and entertaining. It kept my attention throughout the story. I sympathized with the main character even though I have not been in the same situation as her - so I consider the writing to be good enough. But, when it came to the ending, I felt that it was very weak. I was expecting the story to continue for another 10 pages or so, but instead, the story ended and the book concluded with 10 blank pages. The ending (or lack thereof) reduced my rating. If the ending had been stronger, I would have given the story 5 stars."
2,unsatisfying,"...There are several spot-on, laugh out loud observations about commitment-phobic men and the dating/party scene in Los Angeles. I savor a good girl in the city read as much as the next girl in the city. However, the character in this book is such a neurotic, spineless victim that this book became increasingly difficult to enjoy. Far from being as original and sophisticated as other good Chick Lit we all love (Candace Bushnell, Jane Green, Helen Fielding, etc.)"
1,Are you kidding me?,"""Are you kidding me?"" is what I said when I finished reading this book. I enjoyed the easy read of this book until the end. This. Book. Has. No. Conclusion. To. Any. Of. The. Plots. I feel like I wasted my valuable time reading this book."
2,Not for me,"Benjamin Franklin(OK,the name was just a bit too cute)writes for Filly Magazine. She(yes, she)is also trying to find a man who will commit,or just not be an absolute s**t. When her sister Audrey announces her engagement,Ben not only has to reconsider her single state,she has to find a date for the wedding.""How to Meet Cute Boys"" is liberally sprinkled with articles,quizzes and wisdom pulled from Filly magazine. Ben used their wisdom as she navigates the single life. And she comes to realize that her life is not so bad after all.This book is filled with pop references and pop psychology. It is a bit too lightweight and fluffy for my taste(or my age group). I got way too many snickers diricted my way as I tried to read this at my desk Maybe a good read for someone younger"
4,SURPRISE!,"To be honest, I never thought that a) Harrison Ford movie or b) a modern crime movie could be this good. The genious plot and the stunning photographic scenes kept me glued to my sofa throughout the whole movie. Now, I am not a very big fan of any serious stuff ( I prefer Coen bros. - movies), but now I must admit I'm impressed. Very professional."
4,Better over time,"I like this movie more now than I did the night I first saw it. Back then, the flashbacks irritated me, Julianne Moore's aborted presence frustrated me because I knew she'd done more, and the whole concept of Kimble's primary nemesis not being the one-armed man but a friend and colleague (the cynical 90s -- betrayal and conspiracy) still rankles.Nevertheless, the intelligence of Kimble and Girard, and the taut pacing, make this one thriller that I really can't help but enjoy seeing often. (I only hope that Ford one day receives the career recognition that Jones already has. True, it was Jones' lacing his character with flashes of wit that likely earned him the Oscar, but Ford's intensity and the empathy he draws from the viewer are also admirable and contribute greatly to the movie's impact.)"
4,Who is the fugitive ?,"Ok I like Harrison ford, to my mind he is one of the best actor for this kind of movie ! But the game was not won, and make a story with a fugitive is quite difficult. How can the spectator participate in this crazy story ? ... noone is free on the earth, who say that one day you will not be catch by the police and you are not the guilty? I am from france whre the death sentance is forbidden but look in USA ... So for people who are scared of this situation ... you could get some nice ideas form Harrison ford. Ok you have to be lucky, but we never know ! This movie has a real good suspense and you are often surprised ! Harrison Ford is brillant (I love his beard). Enjoy your movie !"
5,A classic action thriller,"What makes ""The Fugitive"" such a successful and superior film is that it knows what it is: an action/mystery film. It makes no attempt to make itself bigger or more intellectual than it is (as did the American version of ""The Vanishing""). Harrison Ford, surprisingly underplaying the role of Dr. Kimball--others might have overworked his grief and angst--turns in a brilliant performance. And the always reliable Tommy Lee Jones does an icy, sparkling job as Kimball's persuer, US Marshal Sam Gerard. So good a performance that he earned a well-deserved Oscar for it.The other key to the movie's success is Andrew Davis' dazzling direction. He keeps the pace frenetic for a good deal of the film, and the pot is always kept boiling. Close calls and intense chases keep the tension and suspense at fever pitch. ""The Fugitive"" will endure for a long time as a classic action thriller."
5,pure fun in the best way possible,"Sela Ward(tv's Once and Again) is Harrison Ford's(Hollywood Homicide)wife and she is killed....Ford says its the one armed man..but he is thrown on a bus to prison when the bus is taking over and he escapes running threw the woods and dodges cops trying to find the one man who killed his beautiful wife...Tommy Lee Jones(U.S. Marshals) is the man on the hunt for Ford and he will stop at nothing just to get my man..twists and turns take a good ride in a nicely written script..forceful performances make this worth the ride and Ford should of one an award...both him and Jones should of. also starring Tom Wood(Under Siege), Joe Pantoliano(The Matrix) and Julianne Moore(Magnolia)"

5,Outstanding film!...,"This is one of the best adventure stories, best mysterys, best suspense-thrillers of 1993, of the 90's of all time. Harrison Ford is brilliant. Tommy Lee Jones turned in the best performance of his career. It also has one of the top 5 action movie stunts ever recorded on film. That train wreck sequence is just so heart pounding, edge of your seat, biting your nails down past the cuticles exciting that you just have to stop and watch it again, rewind it immediately and just watch two or three extra times. Phenomenal, phenomenal story, performances and film as a whole."
5,wow,harrison ford rocks! the movie was every bit as good as the tv show and more. no wonder jones won an oscar. keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout!
4,Fugitive,this movie was amazing!I loved every part of it(except the opening credits)It kept me wondering what was going to happen and it awed me beyond belief when the truth was revealed. An excellent movie.
4,The Fugitive,"The Fugitive---Harrison Ford-Tommy Lee JonesTwo multi-talented actors in the same movie-Great! One of the best remakes of any film or series I've ever seen. I list this as one of my top 10 movies. The street scenes as well as location scenes are well filmed. The story follows a simple line, without the viewer wondering what is happening! Superb movie, I gave it 4 stars, because I've never seen a 5 star film."
2,"Great DVD, ""TERRIBLE HD DVD""","2 stars because the movie itself, all though now old and dated, is still edge of the seat entertainment and very well produced.However, on HD DVD, the audio and video quality is extremely poor, well below par and I think far worse than the original DVD.I had friends around and was showing off my HD DVD player and was so embarrassed after watching the first 20 mins or so that I turned it off and played a DVD !0 stars for the general movie quality, it is appalling!""Don't waste your money on this horrible HD version."""
4,Excellent film on the way to becoming a classic,An excellent version of the original David Janssen character and story. Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford are both terrific in their respective roles of hunter and hunted. As an added bonus (for Chicagoans or people who love Chicago) the film provides a realistic view of the city where most of the story unfolds. This should be in most action/drama/suspense fan's flim collection.
3,Good for VHS,"This VHS arrived, I must admit I was expecting a DVD, but that was my error not the seller. We did enjoy the movie and the tape had no faults."
3,Why Harrison Ford's Kimball was better than David Janssen's,Janssen was actually an actor of very limited acting ability. He was also drunken and self-absorbed and this all got wrongly mistaken for a man deep in thought as he was on the run from the law (as Kimble was supposed to be). The Fugitive series could suffer violently in watching it rerun as Janssen's obviously highly limited acting talent makes all the eps seem way too much alike. Harrison Ford OTOH is an actor of far greater emotional range. He could have perfectly played Kimble on a weekly tv series and been 5 times more interesting than Janssen had ever been. Ford also has greater energy than Janssen ever did. This makes Ford a great screen presence.
2,I Didn't Do It! It Was the One Armed Man!,"Come on, give me a break. That's what they all say, Harrison. What's wrong with you people? This movie was boring. It started out alright with the murder scene and Mr Ford looking like some kind of a wooly mammoth, which was amusing, and then went downhill fast. I don't know, maybe I'm just hard to please. But my viewing partner agreed with me that this one was a big fat let down. How many minutes of this film had Julianne Moore in it? Five? So what is her name doing on the opening credits? The ending is also pathetic. Oh, it's ok Harrison. Gosh, we're real embarrassed and sorry about all of this. Forgive and forget? Uh huh. I never once held my breath or even felt sorry for the good doctor. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Harrison, I weep for the good old days."
5,Best Actors Ever!,Exciting! The good guy always wins in the end.Coudn't have picked better actors for the movie.What a great way to spend my evening!
2,"Excellent film, but non-lossless audio on bluray = waste of money","You'll get more comprehensive synopsis of the film in other reviews. I am just appalled that there is no lossless audio. For those of you that don't know, Dolby Digital 5.1 is DVD quality audio. Ripoff. The picture of course is a bit better that the DVD just because of the resolution (it WILL look better than the DVD on your HDTV) but also subpar to most blurays (even MUCH older films). Just look at what was done with Jaws. I am mainly posting this because maybe if enough people complain, it'll get a proper release, just like what happened with The Fifth Element and Total Recall (original film). Don't buy this garbage release. Five stars for the film though."
5,Great special edition DVD,"They did a good job of putting this together, considering the movie is 8 years old. Lots of technical and creative process covered and the commentary track was interesting to listen to as well. I was very surprised at how much the actor's themselves contributed to the making of this movie and is a real tribute to their skill."
5,Much More Than Excellent!,"This film, when made, was far ahead of its time. Superb performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones leave you on the edge of your seat in an entirely credible story line with a cast of supporting characters second to none. This film is packed with suspense, drama, incredible surprises and a climatic, emotional ending. No wonder it was nominated for over half a dozen Academy Awards.The DVD quality was virtually flawless, but for one isolated instance that seemed a one second overlap in splicing which, for a 17-year-old film, is entirely inconsequential. Somehow without the use of special effects and modern CGI, the director and all his technicians created exceptionally brilliant scenes that seemed entirely real and vivid. Especially dramatic was the train wrech, Kimbal's jump off of the dam and the fight scenes on the top of the hotel where the medical conference was being held. You could almost feel yourself there experiencing everything live."
5,Always exciting,No matter how often you watch this it is always exciting. One of the greatest movies ever made...
2,Warning - Cardboard 'shell' and not true widescreen,"This review has nothing to do with the quality of the movie and everything to do with the quality of the DVD.The case is cardboard, not a plastic clamshell. As a result, it will deteriorate much more quickly and lose its aesthetic qualities.The 'widescreen' is really a fullscreen movie with matting (horizontal black bars) added at the top and bottom. What does this mean? MISSING CONTENT.This is a big disappointment for something identified as being produced in June 2002."
5,Incredibly brilliant!,"The Fugitive is Harrison Ford's best work of the 90's. It is a magnificent film. Ford as Richard Kimble must stay ahead of Lt. Gerard, played by Tommy Lee Jones. As a suspense/thriller/action movie, The Fugitive delivers. It intelligently keeps Kimble barely out of the law's reach, culminating in breathtaking escape scenes. Then there is the bus-train-wreck that is one of the best film accidents ever. This a movie that well deserves its reputation. See it and you won't be disappointed"
5,Intelligent thriller,"I watch this about once a year and have for over 3 years, and I see more and more of the nuances each time. There is not a lot of gratuitous violence (like in many ""thrillers"") as it focuses on a compassionate doctor's efforts to stay out of prison while trying to clear his name. Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford are both excellent in this film."
4,11 year old gives thumbs up,My middle schooler gave this movie high thumbs up. He thought it was very exciting. It's an oldie but goodie.
3,Great Movie! Poor quality dvd.,"No doubt about it this is a great movie. It was nominated for Best Picture in '93. But my three star review is for the poor quality dvd. The picture is very grainy. I'm waiting for Warner Brothers to come out with a better quality dvd, maybe a 20th aniversary edition-where they can use a better quality copy of the film for the dvd transfer. And from what I understand the Blueray version is not much better."
5,Of Course I will Help Harrison Ford:) !,"What woman in her right mind wouldn't help Harrison? I mean ocme on, he's smart, he's cute and he needs help! Plueeze people? What's the problem..?Once Tommy Lee figures out that this guy is on the right trail, he wants his new super hero to win.Heck, I will do anything to help the good doc uncover the truth in his search for liberty, justice and to clear his GOOD name."
5,Amazing,One of the best movie classics from Harrison Ford. A great movie to watch over and over again. I would suggest seeing this movie if you have not see it before. Five stars!!!!!
4,nicely done HD-DVD,"All right, so this HD-DVD is not home theater demo material. It still easily surpasses the standard edition upon side by side comparisons. Yes, there are still some scenes that look like standard DVD, but for the most part, you can see Harrison's beard more clearly as well as many other details. Perhaps this is a testament to the movie itself...the story is so good you don't simply sit there and marvel at the clarity! Until another edition comes along to best this latest one ( and you know one will), then this is the one to buy!"
3,"Picture quality was on par with DVD, not really sharp like Blu","Picture quality was on par with DVD, not really sharp like Blu-ray. I was kind of frustrated because I expected more, but it is better than DVD, so go ahead and upgrade if you get it cheap. Definitely don't pay more than $10 for it, though...and don't expect it to compare to other Blu-ray titles in the picture quality. Great, great film, though!"
2,"I'd give it a much higher rating, but this one's on the Blu...","warner continues to issue all of their products with the Nasty, NASTY VC-1 codec because it was easy for them to do it both in Blu-ray and hd-dud. And I can see the differences in their releases and other companies who use the FAR more superior AVC. They even stick only to the antiqued douby-digital! Never have I seen a release with a DTS track in any of warners stuff, and it rubs me raw because I usual see the DTS mark at the end of the credits in most of the movies!!!"
2,Worked only 6 months.,Bought this for our modem. Worked well at the beginning but lasted only 6 months. Had to buy a new one.
1,Horrible,"This is by far the most horrible record I've ever heard. A thin voice and a thin production. It might be something for die hard discofox and Modern Talking fans, but I really doubt that. All in all: a very very ""thin"" CD."
3,Not what I expected,"Another ""just ok"" book. It was just not what I expected. I would not really recommend this to someone that is looking for great ideas."
3,Warhammer Novel had potential,"This fantasy novel held great potential, but unfortunately runs kinda out of steam about halfway thru. With beautiful art cover work, this novel held fantastical delights that rivaled those of R. A. Salvatore's hugely successful dark elf series.I loved the imagery of the dark elves and their T-Rex-like war steeds, and those action sequences were done quite well, but with the main character being so bad, with no redeeming qualities, the reader is left not caring much for him. After about the halfway point in the novel, I found myself not caring much for him.But the novel was pretty fast-paced, laced with enough action to keep it from being too bogged down. There are better fantasy novels out there with the full range of everything one needs to read to fulfill all areas of storytelling. But for a light adventure read, this one should do."
4,Ubermonkey says thumbs up!,"THE GOOD: This a very good book! Dan Abnett nails the grim world of the dark elf in the grim world of the Warhammer universe. His writing style is terse and he holds nothing back. I truly enjoyed each scene as they were displayed before me.THE BAD: Only if you have a weak stomach will this be bad. The dark elf society enjoys much carnage and Abnett likes to show as much as he can (without be sickly gratuitous).THE UGLY: Malus...conniving, evil, smart and darn ugly!Ubermonkey says that if you are looking for grim, dark fantasy with no real protagonist, this is for you."
3,not very good condition,"The front cover of the book was bent, this was purchased as a Christmas gift for my brother in law"
1,Misleading,"Far too many of the suggested careers in this book are long shots, at best. Nemko makes it sound like if you're willing to get the necessary education or put some effort into getting some expreience, you can move into any of the niche areas he recommends in his book. If only that were true. Too many of his recommendations have long ago been discovered, or are simply areas in which your odds of being selected, even if you are a Harvard grad with impeccable credentials, are about the same as winning a state lottery."
2,"Lots of Options, but Impractical","I still had no idea what to do with my life after graduating and losing my first job after college. It's just the economy, and now I've had a good job for a year. You don't have to choose a career. One will choose you eventually. You will float from job to job until you find something you like enough to do for a while. Reading about different jobs and how to obtain them was just overwhelming and impractical to me."
3,A decent book.,This book gave me a few new ideas. I found it to be a inspiring read and I liked the format. Its not a book worth buying though. I suggest you check it out from your local library instead.
1,Basic job hunting info and misleading career guidance,"I came across this book when advising a friend's college-age child who was researching careers and was using this book.On the plus side, the book does contain info on basic job search skills. I would say that most (if not all of it) is now widely available via the internet.Very troubling was the inaccurate guidance regarding specific careers - some of it was just outdated, but some of it was inaccurate to the point of being ""dangerous"" for a reader with little knowledge or experience, and who would choose to spend time/effort pursuing a career based on the info in this book. I would have to recommend against using this book as a key source for making a career choice."
3,"A fun book, but was expecting more.","After reading through this book several times I found a few problems with it. I noticed that most of the questions found in the ""25 most revealing questions"" part of the book were not specific enough and did little in helping me find a career that suited my interests and needs. I wasn't able to find a career or two to really research, which disappointed me a little bit.There were some good parts of the book such as ""The Cool Careers Yellow Pages"" which gave a list of many careers and its niches. But There were some problems: It did not clearify what kind of degree's to get for some of those careers. It could have gone into more detail.The book was very fun to read and gave me some good ideas to boot. Unfortunately, I was looking for something a little more serious and concrete."
4,"disruption, reconfiguration, and meaning","In a genre often characterized by works so boundlessly eloquent as to say nothing, Wolfe explores the power of a carefully limited and restricted discourse to say *something* - ultimately, something very important."
5,"""Uncanny"" is an understatement...","I wish I could give it 6 stars! ""Uncanny"" is a disputed understatement of the visual encounter found herein. I couldn't believe my eyes--it was like staring into the sun. The candid witicms offset by the terse sense of jaded sarcasm were unnerving. ""Panic now"" indeed!"
5,uncanny,Refreshingly redundant like double aged French brie. Mr Wolfe certainly deserves two thumbs up for victory.
5,UN. . . believable!,"This book shines, a marvelous addition to any collection . If monkeys, muscle cars, defunct superheroes, and crazy bio-mechanical thingies are your bag, then you gotta get two. A real page turner. It will keep you guessing until the very end, and then some."
5,Vote Wolfe,"No matter what your opinion of art or books, this is the one to buy this holiday season. Mr. Wolfe has his finger on the pulse of what it means to be a consumer in the year 2000 or what being a consumer was like back in'79 for that matter. If I were a wealthy art collector type, I'd buy all the original Shawn Wolfe I could get my hands on, but I'm not, though I'm perfectly satisfied with owning fine reproductions of Wolfe contained in this quality paperback book, which I proudly display on my kitchen table. It goes great with any General Mills brand cereal and a cup of Starbucks coffee. It's mighty tastey when perused with straight whiskey, Jack Daniels, as well. Buy this book, feast your eyes, then gift it to a girlfriend who will cherish Mr. Wolfe's book, although soon forget you. I've lost three copies of this precious art document to transient women this month alone! So spend your money where it counts. Vote Wolfe."
2,A bum-licking Dragon,"The summers of my childhood were spent with my head stuffed in a trunk. My nimble fingers groped for Legos in a vat of sweat, dust and debris; a plastic prospector, searching for the perfect design to assign to the heat induced delusions of poor ventilation. It was then that I saw it, the bum-licking dragon-The visage hovered above me, dripping salivary stink onto my brow-- anointing my cranium with crud-stench...In the tangerine bliss that followed I had a glimpse of the future. That glimpse was this book, ""Uncanny,"" and Shawn Wolfe is that dragon.Amen."
4,The Orange Milkmaid Can,"How do you know when to stop? All the oceans could not hold the amount of color, a sampling, fortunate seedling. It's hardly uncanny. Rather, it fills the eyes, makes the hours flow into a lens of your sweet, sweet shining. Shawn has provided a slice of the wonder, a soft wing under which we may rest from the storm, a slight shiver. Who?"
1,FauxAdvertising w/ Retro Imagery? How Truly Subversive & Rad,"The best thing about the end of the millenium is we finally got rid of that Beatkit guy! The '40s advertising imagery (""detourned,"" 'natch), the slacker irony, the '70s typography & color schemes, the sub-Negativland/ Andre sticker campaign--who cares about any of it? It's all eye candy for slow indie-rockers and beat freaks who find ""The Baffler"" profound. This material is all handled so dunderheadedly by Mr. Wolfe, no wonder it had to be printed in a vanity edition. One can always trust Dave Carson to have his finger on a dead pulse."
4,"fun, fresh new monopololy version","This is a fun new twist on an old classic. I like the way it is designed to play faster thnan the original as well. You really need zt least 3 poople to play, but it is a good time when played!"
2,Unexpected,"I'm a grandma and my 11 year old grandaughter really enjoyed playing Monoploly Tycoon on my computer so I ordered this for her thinking that it was a computer game. Yes. I know I should have read the details!She said it needed a television to play it and it was kind of neat, but she didn't play it anymore."
4,"Great music, you'll tap your foot","I love the music, but I think it fits my yoga practice more than my meditation practice. It is quite upbeat and, in meditation, I find myself 'chair dancing' rather than finding my still place."
4,Shocking and poignant.,"This book shows the story of the rendition of ""people."" One would think that when the subject of ""rendition"" or kidnapping by government would only concern Taliban or Iraqi insurgents or international terrorists. In many cases it does. In most cases however, it contains stories of people who were just living their lives normally like any other citizen. Some of them were and are innocent American citizens. Guilty of being Arabic or Muslim. I am a Christian, but fear that if the administration in power doesn't agree with my political ideals whether it be democrat or republican, they could render me. It really makes you think."
4,A good starting point,"The size and book jacket caught my attention at the local bookstore. I'm glad that it did. The book is around 200 pages and filled with photographs. It can be easily read in a day or two.What I like so much about this book so far, is the feeling that your part of the investigative team. Partly this is due to the writing, which is clear and concise. Second, are the photographs (""Ghost"" signatures, documents, buildings) which correspond to the story being told at that point. All of the photographs, except for one were taken by the Mr Paglen.What conclusions if any, the authors come to, I dont know. I'm on page 58. I do know its an engaging and page turning story that will leave me wanting to learn more. Thank you Mr Paglen and Mr. Thompson."
3,Please deliver me from the eighties.,"The first several chapters of the book are valuable tools to help ""brand"" yourself and create a ""mind map"" -strengths, weaknesses, core competencies etc. The rest of the book is just filler. Ryan writes, ""Nobody gets to the top without hard work"". ""Play close attention to your hygiene.."" ""Smile often.."" ""Get a manicure.."" These little gems of advice don't make me feel too warm when I am about to be crushed in the jaws of the corporate interview process. Ryan's tone is more condescending than empowering and left me wondering if Ryan is really in touch with today's corporate culture."
2,Good grief!,"I bought this album, at considerably more than I usually spend on music, because I had heard ""The Jogger"" and other Loeki Stardust pieces on YouTube. On the one hand, their performance is always incredible, full of vivacity and technical excellence; on the other hand, with the exception of ""The Jogger,"" I found every piece on this recording completely unbearable. It's all postmodern stuff; it was literally painful to listen to in places. The quartet can't be faulted for this--they brought surprising feeling to work that I found totally inhuman--but the pieces themselves are simply unmusical."
4,"1, 112 Down to Earth Garden Secrets review","This is a great book for novice and experienced gardeners alike. I am a semi serious gardener and after a quick flip thru of the book, found tips useful for my area in that first 10 minutes!"
4,An insider's look,"In my opinion some reviews of this book have been overly harsh and might I say holier than thou. I for one appreciated the honesty of the author throughout the book and found it quite revealing. That doesn't mean I agree wholeheartedly with his attitude but I definetly thought it was worthwhile for him to publish his true thoughts and emotions. All in all I though the book was enjoyable and I was glad I bought it. I learned a great deal and could see why (as I have always wondered) so many doctors are detached, unemotional and seemingly uncaring."
1,Read White Coat instead.,"Konner was an anthropologist before he wrote this book, and he looks at medical school from an anthropological perspective. At times, I found his views to be overly critical of the medical field as a whole. Overall, the book was just boring to me. If you are looking for a more humanistic approach to the med school experience, I highly recommend the book ""White Coat"" by Jennifer Lerner Rothman."
3,"He's not a teacher, is he?","I found this book to be a good journey through med school. Dr. Melvin Konner is too ""teacher-like"" for me. To me, it seemed that he was trying to tell me too much and that I wasn't smart. He also told too much about his life before medical school. It had a slow beginning. Other than that, it picked up in the middle. Good Book."
1,Waste of Time,"Both my girlfriend and I have read this book and both of us were sadly disappointed. If you are looking for information on what medical school entails in terms of what rotations you come upon, then this is a great read, but usually that information is available simpler on most medical schools websites. Melvin Konner, arrogant and brash, should rename his book ""I am right and everyone else is wrong"". If you are looking for a poorly written dialogue on the criticism of Doctors and criticism of the way medical school is run THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! A great but semi-dated book on medical training is ""The Intern Blues"" check it out."
5,Must read,"I will fall into the camp of reviewers who found this book to be insightful and valuable. People who see Konner as arrogant, pompous, and overly critical of the medical field are missing the point. It is Konner's prior experience as an anthropologist that allows him to analyze the social and cultural dynamics of medical workers. I don't know where Konner's arrogance is being perceived. Konner certainly judges actions and deeds according to his own values, but those values are neither elitism or pomposity, but empathy and humanism.The premise of the book is such: at Harvard Medical School, the ""best"" in the country, one should receive the finest medical education and be exposed to medicine at its best. Read the book and find out what it's really like."
3,"Nice effort, but little depth","Dr. Konner meant well, I assume. His memoirs are interesting to read, but they seemed to gloss over the true feelings experienced by third and fourth year medical students. His self confidence oozes from the pages (""I only applied to the 'best' schools, and you should know that I AM a PhD""). If he were my classmate, he would have been despised by the other students and residents."
3,"Interesting, but seriously flawed and dated","Although I did enjoy portions of this book, I was also particularly annoyed at his constant misogynistic tone -- women, be they patients or fellow physicians -- are often first described physically, with particular note paid to their attractiveness. It seems that Konner clearly believes he is superior to many of his co-workers, as he repeatedly interrupts the medical narrative to mention his status in the anthropological field. This isn't a terrible book, but it certainly isn't a book I'd recommend to very many people."
3,back to the studio,"I bought this cd because of Chris Stamey's work with the the dB's and his talent as a producer. None of the covers on this disc really compares favorably with the originals and the original songs are nowhere near as strong as his contributions to the dB's albums or his production efforts. If you are interested in this artist check out the early works of the dB's,try to find a copy of Mavericks w/Peter Holsapple or listen to his production of Whiskeytown, Yo La Tengo and Alex Chilton among others."
2,unfortunate,"I love most of Stamey's solo stuff, I like YoLaTengo...but how did they get the idea to do a joint-live-covers disk....just doesn't work"
2,Not worth it,"I wouldn't buy again. I was expecting to get 2 rings based on the picture shown with the product. You get only one and the shipping costs much more than the ring. My fault, though. I didn't read the description carefully. However, I wish I had gotten a metal ring because the terracotta can easily slip off the light bulb and break."
4,sweet story,"It was just to short. But I still liked it well enough. I recommend ""Stardust of Yesterday"". the brother of Jason, Kendrick a most hansome ghost."
2,To Kiss In the Shadows,I really didn't enjoy this book. Ms Kurland writes well but her need to make her heroines pure and her writing PG is annoying. I understand writing sexy characters might be more of a challenge but romance should be romance.
2,great strings except 3rd...,"i recommend all serious players use elixirs...whats wrong with eaze of play? this particular set was disappointing tho, i wanted heavier strings for my lower tuned guitar. great stuff but the 3rd string comes coiled like the 4rth 5th and 6th...usually strings 1, 2, and 3 are smooth..on this one it came wound...i hope it was manufacturer error, cus i also notice that that particular string is impossible to bend. ive been playing for a decade now, so dnt assume its me. for a full bend i probably get 1/4th a bend...sounds horrible. this has convinced me to go back to mediums. 11-49, i have these on my d-e standard tuning guitar, work great."
2,Not so good guitar strings,"These strings are great when you play power chords, but if you want to play a solo or something that requires playing a single note at a time, the rest of the strings will start playing without me touching them. It's annoying and a tried to fix it by lowering the Gain on my amp, but it didn't work. If you're a beginner like me (2 years playing) I sugest lighter strings. I love playing metal songs and I guess I thought the heavier the better, but I was wrong. Elixer is a great brand, but I will get lighter strings next time."
4,Great gate,"Excellent dog gate. Even in tricky, not evenly spaced areas, this gate does the job. We bought this gate because we didn't completely trust our dogs with our newborn and it has helped us live a little easier."
5,roots music from the Sahara,"A marvelous recording of real roots music sung by Tuareg musicians of the Saharan region of north Africa. Most are focused on unadorned solo and ensemble vocals, accompanied by percussion and drums, occasioanally by spike fiddle. No guitars, no electricity. This is the real deal.The record label says: The desert represents both a concrete and an abstract reality, in the sense that it is a natural barrier surrounding an area where the harshness of daily life can cut one off. But it is also a mythical space untrodden by man, a place for spiritual exploration, and an essential cornerstone in the collective unconscious of the Tuaregs, whose culture is transmitted entirely by words of mouth. Ikewan is the testimony in poetry and music firstly of the ancestral values of a threatened people, but also of the gradually disappearing collective memory of the Tassili n'Ajjer area."
3,Extremely dry,"Much of this book is related directly to experiences of the Franco-Prussian War, which is unfortunate because if you don't have a very detailed knowledge of the war it will be very hard to follow. Moltke was undoubtably brilliant but it is difficult to see where he is going sometimes. If you have more than a passing interest in either the 1871 War or German military history you will no doubt be gratified. Everyone else, watch out."
2,ONE bowl,"I bought this thinking I was buying a set of 4 bowls. I gave it 2 stars because the bowl is fine, however there needs to be a better discription stating that you are only buying ONE bowl."
1,Has Lead,"After reading that corelle plates are not completely lead and cadmium free, I decided to switch to glass! The levels are supposedly in the ""safe"" range, but I'd rather go with glass ones that I know have zero heavy metals. Plus, it's made in china."
3,Nice,"Holds food, easy to wash, looks a bit more distinct than the everyday bowl. Doesn't insulate from heat too well, though."
3,why would they put sticker on all the corelle war i ordered??,"i ordered and received bowls and plates of different sizes.... everyone of them had a sticker that was very difficult for me to remove...even after washing them i was cleaning paper out of the sink and the corelle ware still had glue and backward writing on them, the stickers had some sort of directions on them that could have only been seen on the other side of 'clear' glass not through winter frost, i never did figure out what it said, maybe i should have used a mirror and a magnifying glass.... also i found small bubbles on the bottom of the bowls and the very bottom was rough...."
3,It's a bowl. It's microwaveable. It costs too much.,"There isn't much to say: It's a bowl. The material is durable. It's microwaveable, and you don't have to worry about chemicals that might leach into your food from a plastic bowl. I don't know that I would consider these particularly stylish, but I have not found anything better for making my morning oatmeal. The bowl holds much more than a mug, though I admit I sometimes miss having a handle.I'd give the bowl a 5-star rating if it were not so ridiculously expensive. When I bought mine a couple of months ago for about $10 (and free shipping) I thought it was high but not unreasonable. At today's price (~$15 cost plus nearly $10 shipping) it is simply not a very good bargain.The bundle of four of these bowls plus a serving piece that another reviewer suggested is currently $24.99 (and eligible for super saver shipping) so I don't see how buying this bowl makes any sense at all at today's price."
1,*one* bowl for how much?,"I bought this assuming I'd get 4 bowls. Instead I got a box with tons of bubble wrap on one bowl.The bowl itself is nice enough. It just isn't worth $19.75.This is a much better deal at $23.99Corelle Livingware Corelle Fun Packs, Winter Frost White"
5,Deep dish perfect for soup,"My husband and children complained about the size of the standard bowl Corelle includes in the package so I purchased these. I think they are a little big, but I am overruled 3:1. The bowl is a huge hit with my family."
4,The Window Of My Heart'1992 (her second album),My favourite songs areBirds Of ParadiseSail Over Seven SeasSayonaraThe Window Of My Heart
1,Didn't work,"We got this for my son and it just didn't work. We thought it needed a harder through, so we got his uncle (a softball coach) to test it out. He pronounced it ""pathetic"" and we returned it."
3,Order 0.5 size bigger,I run with such shoes (differnt color) for about a year on cross-country trails. The shoes are light and nice but fell apart - they are cheap. I wanted to order another pair but forgot the size previous were. Usually i wear 8.5 or 9.0. There's something wrong with this model. I ordered 9.0 and they don't fit but since they are so cheap I gave them as a present to my friend. Happy end!
2,Too little information,"Basic Wiring was and is a major disappointment.Much of the 128 pages are dedicated to pictorials of electrical components.The photographs are of high quality, but who wants to know what the""face plate of a manual timer switch"" looks like?That took up half a page.Too basic to help any one but the totally uninformed."
3,OK book,Its just OK...you'll need another book to feel comfortable enoug to do actual electrical work
3,Screenwriter's Own Comments,"Honor & Glory was a prime-time HBO Feature; and Entertainment Weekly gave us a B-.I wrote the screenplay for Honor & Glory. The line of dialogue cited in another Amazon review (""I'll peel your testicles like grapes."") is my own. I like to think it signals a movie that isn't taking itself too seriously.What we did have going for us, back then, was something now so normal, our pioneering isn't even noticeable anymore. We were among the very first movies, long before The Matrix, to incorporate kung-fu action into strictly American locations.Cynthia is a major star in half the world -- just not this half. Our loss. What a woman! And in the right mood, Honor & Glory is still a righteous hoot.We had fun. Hope you do, too."
3,average.....,an average fighting movie.....starring chynthia rothrock..... no impressive martial arts in here......but worth watching anyway.....an average action movie....
3,Horrible experience- improved,"After amazon lost my original order, they shipped a second order that came a week late. As soon as I open the package to make sure everything was right, I noticed that half of the hardware was missing. I took days off of work to fix my vehicle with this part, after the first order was lost by amazon, and the second order missing hardware I wasted time off of work and still cant install this part due to the missing mounting hardware and screws.Amazon sent a third order which was complete and shipped it overnight express. I am extremely happy with the product. I highley recommend the product. If it was not for the shipping problems I would have given 5 stars. At least amazon corrected the problem."
4,Flex-a-lite,"I installed this on a 2000 Silverado. The kit fit however they sent the wrong fuse. The instructions were ok, easy to follow. Shortly after installing the fans it became obvious I needed a larger alternator to handle the load. (take this into consideration). After all is said and done it does what I needed it to do so I am happy with it. I only had issues with the parts in the kit."
5,Best Since Either/Or,"This is a CD single version of a 7' single that was as far as I know released not long after the release ""Either/Or."" This CD shows definite hints as to what Smith would do with the Dreamworks album ""XO"" however this album stands out as a far superior songwriting and production than that of the major label release. Some of the finest Smith with a larger band. This is the best recordings of Smith since the album ""Either/Or."""
3,A good espionage story,"Peter Arundsen is bored with his conventional wife and his respectable job in the city. He hankers after the dangerous days as a spy with the SIS, and cherishes his contacts with other disbanded members of The Firm at regular weekend parties, hosted by their old chief, Philip Wetherby.But this time the party is overshadowed by news that one of their member, James Dunne, has defected to East Germany. First Arundsen resists Wetherby's request to investigate, but cannot refuse his beautiful and mysterious niece Mary.As their love affair deepens, Arundsen finds himself in a tangle of treason and intrigue. And caught in a trap where terror and tragedy block every exit, and the woman he loves is the bait...The good old days of the Cold War revisited. An excellent reading by Sean Barrett makes this audiobook quite enjoyable."
2,Roads to Love and Happiness,"Being married 72 years and reading the various comments of the persons reasoning their longevity of marriage I concluded the most important beginning was the honesty of the individuals and reason for making a commitment. Attractions to each other had include,love, sharing, devotion and above all no thoughts of ""sampling"" It was doing one for another and enjoying the joys in so doing. ."
5,A Real Live Reviewer!!,"My wife and I were fortunate in having been selected to participate in this wonderful book.We are now into our 61st year of a happy marriage and would hope young folks reading this book would take lessons from the ""pros"" that have made it together for 50 years.The book is so well organized and exciting...it could be a must read for a psychology class by teaching....always have the last word....""yes dear"""
2,I'm dissapointed,"I love Hellboy and that makes watching this all the harder.The animation is bland and ""Saturday morning"" grade.The voice work is bland and uninspired. Listen to (and watch) THE AMAZING SCREW ON HEAD and then watch and listen to this and you will see and hear how good art and talanted voice work make all the differance.One can be a good actor and still do bad voice work and that is clearly the case here."
4,hell why did they make it,The quality of the video was good but the plot was thin. Ron Perlman and the other actors played their parts well but were limited by the script. I'd stay with the movies and the other cartoon of hellby which was superior to this one.
4,It's great !,"Super de retrouver le démon sympa en animation.Histoire bien menée, animation correcte, ambiance générale respectée, humour au rendez vous. Une réussite."
3,Some much better than the live version.,"I'm not a reading of comics but liked this movie. There's just something lost if the creaters try to cross over out of animation. Makes me wonder how Ghostrider will be? I don't have high hopes. Only the makers of Spiderman got it perfect. If you like cartoons in general you'll most likely enjoy this one. Also, You'll enjoy Mask of the Phantasm- the only good Batman movie, IMHO."
2,Good plot and dialogue,"I gave this more than just one star because I was able to watch it all the way through once. But that's about it... The plot and dialogue are pretty good; I never read the comic series, but loved the live action version, and this seemed true to the spirit of that one.But I'll never watch it again, because I just don't understand how in 2007 a cartoon can be released with worse art and animation than Looney Tunes was capable of in the 1940's. Worse even than most anime (oooh, harsh, but true). Think ""Steamboat Willie"" in color."
1,low quality animation,"the animation for mignola's 'the amazing screw on head' was awesome. not only did the designs look very close to mignola's style, but the timing translated the humor very well.this hellboy animated movie was not made by the same animators. designs are just drawn very poorly, and the timing was awful! the pauses between dialogue felt awkward which ruined the humor of the stories, many of which were directly sourced from the comics.i'm being critical because i'm a huge hellboy fan, a fan of animation, and this one is just not worth watching because of the poor quality."
5,Awesome Extras for a great film!,"This film is a nice introduction to the world of Hellboy. Before this film I could care less about Hellboy, & now I've bought the live action version & some comics!The extras are amazing on this DVD! They aren't the traditional ""a storyboard is like a giant comic book"" that you get on every other animated DVD. This does very well at explaining how it went from the comic to the animated form & how it differs from the live action. In fact there's discussion from DelTorro who did the live action film. There's also the comic con presentation. There is talk with the voice artists and more!The best part is the DVD-ROM. You can watch the script &/or storyboard along side the movie! However it doesn't work on all computers... But it's great!!A Great Buy"
5,Correction,In my previous review I mistakenly called the Russian editor Katkov. The correct name is N. Nekrasov. Sorry :)
2,No book jacket,"I have ordered two titles in the Everyman's Library series from Amazon. Both were pictured with jackets (see image with this book), but both arrived without jackets. I ordered replacement copies (noting the problem) and replacements were duly sent...with no book jackets. Check before you purchase if you expect to receive the jacket as pictured."
5,Very Sweet,"This is a great gospel album. The album have numerous of style. Traditional song such as ""Born Again"" and Contemporary songs such as ""Miracle Worker"" and ""New Life"". My favorite is ""Serve You"" becauce of the slow groove. They ,also, have a GREAT live performance. If you are in to the hard-down southern gospel singing as will as the contemporary singing, get this album you won't be dissappointed."
4,ouch,"This touched a big nerve. If you've never loved anyone like this, Greene shows you what its like. If you have, then he reminds you what its like. Fantastic characters, weak where everyone is, and strong when required."
3,Odd,"It's an untypical love story, because the characters act very reasonably and don't just follow the voice of their heart. There is a tension, because the reader wants to know how the relationship will develop. The fact that there are several subjects in this book, for example religion, makes the novel more exciting. The end of the novel is very surprising, because you wouldn't expect these events at all. It's a book that you should read yourself. I can recommend if you don't like the usual love stories."
5,More humanistic than some would seem to believe.,"I have to disagree with the previous poster who says this is more spiritual than anything else. Though it is couched in religious terms, I see this as a cautionary tale about the danger of falling into despair, which is relevant to all humans in addition to being the unforgivable sin. I am an avowed agnostic, and this remains my favorite book after several years. I have never read a better book about the experience of loneliness, jealousy, hatred, despair and selfish love."
1,Was it me?,"I tried...I really, really tried. I bought the book and thought ""Hey, if a movie's being made out of it, there must be something there."" Well, I've rethought that idea and I certainly hope the moview is better than the book. I found the writing style to be quite heavy handed and I felt at war with the story and they way it was written. I could only make it through to the middle and then giving up...I couldn't make heads or tails as to what was up and what was down. I sincerely hope the movie is better. <heavy sigh>"
4,"emotions, theology and ethics","If you made a promise to God, from the bottom of your heart and the depth of your soul, would you keep it if He answered your prayer? What do you think would He do if you did not keep your end of the bargain? We can see through most of it, but there is still that cloudy interior which pretty much sums up Bendrix's writing style. The novel written by Graham Greene, is very interesting to read. I like also the romantic and sad parts. The end is very unexpected. I can recommend this novel to everyone who likes to read things which deal with a lot of emotions, theological and moral problems."
4,simply moving,"Following a very interestingly created chronological build, the reader develops a deep empathy with Bendrix, the main character of the book. But its not only the line of time and the characters that are fascinating: London at the time of war is the perfect place for the story of a love affair the author has presumingly not just imagined. Thus, the plot is very lively. The often occuring philosophical thoughts aren't just ornaments, they were a real input for me to discuss again our world and aspects like the possible existence of a higher being."
5,End of the Affair,"My husband read this book for a relgion class in college and I picked it up about four years ago to do some light summer reading. I do not recommend this book for that purpose. At that point I found it hard to get into and put it down, with the intention of never picking it up again. However, when the film version was released this winter I decided to read it (I always read the book before viewing the film). This time I found it to be very compelling. This is an intellectually satisfying book. It has a love story, but also brings in religion and gives one something to think about. I particularly like the characterization of Bendrix. Good read...try it."
3,an extraordinary love story,"first i was't excited at all as i realized that this book conserns a love story. I thought it would be a typical tearjerker, with a happy end. Everything would turn out well, a fairy-tale that would never happen in real life. But it wasn't that way at all. Not that it was any more realistic, but at least it was more thrilling to read.Especially interesting I think is the structure of the book. By anticipating certain rather important things Graham Greene makes the reader curious to know the next event.Nevertheless it was a little confusing to read and it's hard to reconstruct the plot."
5,Before and after the one and only Love of a Lifetime,"I was impressed by the essence content of this very short book. I have never made as many notes from other books as I made from ""Affair"". Snip: (...)"
2,WELL WRITTEN...AND DEADLY DULL,"As well-written as The End of the Affair may be, to me it was a tedious, slow-moving slog. Boring, really. The book is period piece of sorts (written soon after WW II) and there is a small amount of interest created by that fact. Yet, this is not enough wind to keep this sailboat from remaining dead in the water."
2,Would It Ever End,"I am a Greene fan but this story simply dragged when it needed to have some emotional drive. By the end, I cared neither for Henry or Blistex, and had long forgotten Sarah. Greene seems to have had a kernel of a story without an idea of an ending or what the ultimate message was."
3,Greene Was Always Forging The Unknown,"It's amazing that Graham Greene always wrote a book like it was his first. That is also the case in this book, Greene is venturing new territory. This book tells the story of an affair with a mentally disturbed married woman.OK commenter guys, I have edited my review, I hope it does not disturb you anymore. Sorry Guys!"
2,Improbable and boring,Why do I say improbable? Greene does not succeed at all in portraying Sarah in a way in which every male character in the book seems to fall in love with her. There seems to be absolutely nothing special about her. Also Bendrix is portrayed as a cruel egotistical jerk. Why would Sarah fall in love with him? In addition the book is incredibly boring with lots of agonized agonizing. At least it's short.
4,Hard hitting story of the men who defend America,"This book details the bravery and sacrifice made by US servicemen to defend democracy, freedom and decency. It should be read by all who value what we in the West and our civilisation stands for. I salute the tankers, and Ralph Zumbro for his clear sighted and fearless assessments. Buy this book!"
4,A SMALL BOAT MECHANIC'S MUST HAVE!,"I think that most guys would be looking in this book for specific information about specific engines. I know that I purchased the book to help me with a specific outboard problem. Not only was my specific problem adressed, but the information provided helped to lay rest to some long term nagging questions that I had been living with. Just to let you know. This book not only helped me with the problem that made me buy the book in the first place, it helped to jump start me on a couple of engines that I had been putting off for way too much time. It's nice to turn semi-dead inventory into cash. This books not only worth buying. It's worth keeping. Of course, I know that I, personally, and most of you mechanics, could have written a much better book! I guess we'll just have to get along with this one! PRS Linda Isle, Newport Beach, CA."
1,Mastering Errors on the MGM DVD Version,"Definitely don't buy this DVD version from MGM. They have made some serious mastering errors on this edition. Several scenes are subject to double-imaging (no excuse for that), as well as variances in the color timing and the volume. This title is also in badly need of Technicolor restoration: it has a greenish-look and suffers from color fading (I understand that the previous HBO DVD release did also). At the very least, MGM Home Entertainment needs to pull this title and correct the double-imaging."
1,Don't Buy This MGM DVD Release!,Like so many other people I was waiting for this new release on DVD. Imagine my disappointment when I get 24 minutes into the movie and I get double images! It lasted until about 32 minutes later (when Bob Hope encounters the Bucket of Blood). MGM needs to get the message that these classic movies simply can't be treated this way.Fortunately I still have my earlier DVD release thru HBO Films because I'll have to return this copy of the Princess and the Pirate.
2,Poor quality DVD - Good movie.,"If you want a good clear image, you won't be happy with this DVD. I thought I just had a bad one, but as you read the other reviews, you can see that they all have the same problem. I am returning mine. Hope MGM fixes the problem."
4,A Hope Classic - Poor DVD Presentation,This movie is a Bob Hope Classic. What goes through the mind ofthe person responsible for its presentation on DVD?Several scenes are out of focus and colors are unsteady and fadein and out. It is obvious that the print utilized was a well usedcopy and had not been previewed. The sound is also not reproducedwell and volume must be set very high to get the most out of the mono soundtrack. If this is the best that can be done it was awaste of time and effort. The Theatrical Trailer looked and sounded much better. Very disappointing that no background or insights areprovided with this movie either.
4,Bob Hope in Technicolor,"This is a very funny Bob Hope comedy with lots of his trademark bits.(He breaks the fourth wall a lot and makes insulting cracks about Bing Crosby.) He plays a coward involved with pirates Victor McLaglen and Walter Slezak. Walter Brennen is really hysterical . There is a lot of homo erotic humor in this picture, especially between Hope and Slezak in the bath. The transfer is very lush and crisp, and the costumes are beautiful. Virgina Mayo is pretty good and sings a song. The trailer is included which urges you to ""see it from the beginning""."
3,The Princess and the Pirate 1944,"A great movie with a great plot , but theres is some damaged parts in this movie who never been restored , its such called ""double-images"" which mean that the color coating glide apart from the frame , which have to do with film are aging , they could restore movies even in that condition , but its cost much time and money ! , but as they realese this movie they would not sale many . Its a realy great movie and funny . Parts that are not damaged are okay , sharp and clear . If you dont want to get mad watching this movie , its recommended : Do not buy it !"
4,"Good, simple pic","Everytime Bob Hope made a picture in a costume, people would cringe. It doesn't have to be that way, as this movie is heads and tails above ""Cassanova's Big Night"". This is a fun, silly pirate movie that I loved as a kid, and still love now as a twenty-something unemployed male unable to graduate from a state college."
5,At Last!,"I don't know about those other reviews, my copy seemed fine so they must have fixed those poor CQ issues - what else is there to say; Its Bob Hope and Pirates!!!"
5,One of Bob Hope's Best,"I found this movie to be one of his best. In this swashbuckling movie I found a great mix of Pirate action adventure and comedy. The action adventure was real clean fun, and the comedy romance wasn't too mushy. This is a great film for both young and old alike. My 4 yr old boy loved it; I was amazed it kept his attention. He learned alot about Pirates too.My friends 13 yr old daughter couldn't stop laughing."
5,"as usually, NOVA give the insights","as a curious person, I always like to update the newer or newest knowledge, As usual NOVA presents, in interesting way, the new development in green energy, making stuff..... etc I like it. NOVA always give out good stuff."
5,An engaging and entertaining story,"In The Boy Who Stuck Out His Tongue, Edith Tarbescu retells an old Yiddish folk tale about the son of a widow. When his mother asks him to light the fire He just sticks his tongue out at here. he would rather make snowballs than help with chores. But then sticking his tongue out gets him into a problematic situation. When this happens, all the folk of his little Hungarian village rally to his aid -- and our young man learns an invaluable lesson. Judith Mills' colorful artwork is a perfect enhancement to Edith Tarbescu's engaging and entertaining story that will have young readers gleefully turning the pages, one after another!"
5,She's the belle of the ball!,"Sylvia Jean is a young piglet who has Miss Piggy's flair and wardrobe but thankfully not her overbearing and entitled attitude. She loves to dress up for every occasion, be it big or small. Her family and friends take it for granted that Sylvia Jean will show up in something marvelous every time. When the announcement comes that a costume party and contest will be held in town, everyone assumes that Sylvia Jean's outfit will be the biggest and best one of all. Surprise! A wonderful story accompanied by colorful illustrations that match the mood of this porcine community. This little piggy teaches both young and old that sometimes the best way to stand out in a crowd is simply to be yourself."
5,A funny guy talking about an even funnier one... Awesome!,"I wasn't really expecting this kind of amazing compilation of materials and I loved being able to read some of the original cut scripts and here about ideas which were later discarded. I have listened to the radio series and watched the TV series and I really likes Gaiman's portrayal of the behind the scenes drama, as well as some sneaky information on how they got it all done. I also love the snippets we get about Adams working style (disorganised) and his personal life (baffled) because I am terribly nosey and love getting to know more about my favourite authors. I love Gaiman's other work, particularly The Graveyard Book, and expected nothing less than amazing and I was not disappointed."
3,Mostly harmless,"Interesting and funn at times, this book is pretty bland considering it is a biography of one of (in my mind) the greatest authors I've ever read. (I've only read about 5 different authors, however).In Douglas Adams' own review of this book, I totally agree:""The best biography of Douglas Adams & the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy written since this morning"" - D.A.I'd give it a miss, in retrospect. (Maybe you can buy mine)."
2,You get what you pay for....,I bought two of these and two Wavebirds at the same time. As a family we have spent maybe 20 hours or so using all four units and the wavebirds are holding up much better. The biggest problems are sticking buttons and battery holders that keep falling off. I'll be heading out to replace the two Pelicans with two more Wavebirds.
1,Horrible,The accuracy on this thing is horrible. I only use it when I really need to because its so bad. You can click one direction with the joystick and when you let off it will send your character back in the other direction. Its almost impossible to do things that require lining something up or going in a precise direction. I would NOT recommend this controller to anyone.
1,Avoid this item,"I bought two of these controllers and within a couple weeks, both we'e having problems. Both controllers would almost always go to the left. I would be trying to move right, or stand still, but my character in game kept going to the left. As you can imagine, it's hard to aim this way. After a little more use, you can't turn left at all, it just quits working. Keep in mind I bought two different controllers at different times, and they both had the same problem, and they lasted about the same amount of time. My recommendation, find a wired official controller, I've never had any problems with those kind of controllers. The only reason I got a wireless in the first place is because I gave my cousin my gamecube, and I wanted to play my other gamecube games on my wii."
1,Junk,"Bought two at wal-mart to use with the Wii. They do work with it, but very soon after I bought them the analog sticks began to stick in one direction, and they occasionally 'lock up' and need the batteries reseated to work again. Now one controller won't even move in one direction.Junk."
1,Analog sticks fail after a few months,"I bought the black version of this product at Wal-Mart roughly two months ago to replace a wired controller that had worked for me perfectly for a good two years. The wireless controller worked fine for about a month and a half, but now it tends to move the character to the left, even when you're not touching the analog stick. It makes it impossible for me to replay Metroid Prime properly.Avoid this at all costs. Huge money waster."
1,never got it,one week after I the controller was supposed to arrive I got an email from the vendor saying that they were sold out.
1,Does not work with Wii,"I bought this controller along with Super Smash Bros and Mario Cart for GC, and I couldn't get anything to work. None of the games, and none of the Virtual Console games, worked with this thing. DO NOT BUY."
1,A Poor Follow-Up On The Original Model,"I owned the Pelican G3 model that pre-dated this for quite awhile, and was totally and completely satisfied.However, I read that there was a new model that included rumble, and took a flyer on purchasing one. I ended up disappointed.First off, the model you receive may or may not be the model that has rumble support, but probably will not be. Secondly, this particular controller has a serious problem staying calibrated. The control stick is defaulting slightly right, which causes massive problems with gameplay. With no way to manually calibrate or reset, you're pretty well stuck.I'm chalking it up to an error in judgment on my part and looking for a new wireless Gamecube controller."
1,Trash!,"This controller started messing up on me less than 2 days after opening the package. As a previous reviewer stated, the analog stick messes up and your character goes places that you don't intend to take him. This is very unfortunate while playing Smash Brothers on Wii. It is also unfortunate that I got rid of the packaging so I am unable to return it and am forever stuck with this $20 boomerang."
2,"So far, so good","I bought black versions of these from walmart. So far, they work. No problems like I had with the Madcatz/Gamestop wireless controllers. However, these things just feel awful in my hands. These controllers are too big and awkward in my hands. I don't have small hands either. They feel pretty rugged though."
3,OK but not my first recommendation for Denmark travel guide,"As one of four travel guides my family is taking on a 3-week long trip to Europe (mainly Denmark and Sweden), Globetrotter's Copenhagen and Denmark Travel Pack would be lonely on its own.On the plus side, we have enjoyed the removable, fold-out map in the back jacket pocket of the guide. Sidebar comments are also interesting to know. The physical book is of good quality and the small, thin size make it easy to pack and tote around.Suggestions we have for improvements:(1) Write in bullet points, by topic, or in sections by page. The narrative paragraph format, going on for pages at a time, doesn't work well for people trying to coordinate a travel schedule.(2) Decide what makes this guide stand out from the pack and deliver it. Aside from the map, there isn't much in this guide that I couldn't have found out from another of the guides we purchased."
2,Save your money,"""Touching Evil"" has all the elements of a successful series but somehow good story lines and great acting aren't enough. The series just begins. There is no back- grounding. Who are these people and how did they wind up collectively bashing in doors? What is their organization (CSA doesn't tell us much) and what is its or their mission? The photography stinks: Somebody is addicted to hand held shooting. Most the time the screen is a jumble of unrecognizable scenes and sounds. This old Yankee may just have bad hearing but I've been to the UK many times and thought I knew its accents. So much of the dialogue is wasted on things like throats and walls (as opposed to microphones) that even my pretty, young wife (with perfect hearing) can't recognize what the characters sre saying to one another. All these little things add up to a big flop. What a tragedy."
5,Moonlight,Works great! Actually is very bright and intially me fish were confused and would not go to there typical sleeping habits. I angle to moon light against my flurocent light and it works great. The fish were well adapted in one day and now I finally see my banded shimp at night. It also gives all my coral a beautiful glow at night. Lots of oohs and aaas from company
5,Another winner!,"Jenna Mills has written another winner in this fast paced, suspenseful, love story. The characters are complex, with layers of emotions unfolding at just the right pace to keep you turning the pages."
5,Shift in Zeitgeist,"I read this book years ago, and I am getting ready to reread it now. Whitmont's message is one that heals, without being afraid to look at the heart of the matter. If you are interesting in mythology, women's issues, 20th century history, and depth psychology, this is a book for you. It is worth hanging in there with this book as the start is slow, but you are able to mine gems of true insight if you stay with it.This book is for those of us not afraid to look at things clearly, while at the same time knowing there is more to life than meets the eye."
3,not for general system,"had the same problem as the other person, very low volume. I too must not have a premium sound system with my 2008 sonata. I cut cut away the black box and respliced the wire and the radio works fine now, plenty of volume. you can get a regulare harness at crutchfield for $ 10"
1,"Bad harness, cheap/weak solder","The soldering on the speaker output resistors is really bad. Several pulled out when I was connecting it to the stereo. I would avoid this product but if you have to have it just cut the speaker output wires before they enter the resistor box and use them direct, it's not even needed and I'm not sure why they added it.p.s. the resistor box is the black one in the picture"
3,"About the best available, that's still in print","This anthology of biographical quotations is the best of a thin field. It contains about 400 pages of quotes, distributed among the great, the notorious, and current celebrities. Most of the subjects are English and American, with a smattering of European worthies added in. The tone of the collection tends to wisecrackery. A fun collection for dipping, but more solid reference tomes of biographical quotations have been compiled."
2,How to overdo an otherwise nice idea,The flag seems well-made. Only time in the sun and wind will confirm durability.The down-side is that the touted 'antiquing' is so far over-done that the flag looks mildewed and dirty rather than 'aged'. If I had the choice I would replace it with a clean one with 13 stars.It was not a good choice for me.
3,very wrinkled and darkly stained..,"The grandson loved the flag but I thought it should have been lighter, like the picture. It was stained to look old but it was very dark, the white was all at least the color of a lion? and it was wrinkled so, and I do not know if we can wash and iron it, since we are trying to instruct him on the correct handling procedures of a flag."
2,Betsy Ross Flag Quality,"The quality of the flag is not what I expected. The material is thin, not a heavy weight cotton and a small thread count per inch. I can see through the material. Otherwise, I like the flag and have decided to keep it. I would not have purchased the flag if I had seen it first."
2,Disgracefully Dirty,"When I first opened up the flag, my first thought was that it had been sitting out in the rain in it's packaging during the hurricane due to how muddy it looked. Then I noticed the packaging was pristine. I just wanted something nice to hang up, but this just looks far too dirty. As a current military man, I honestly feel it's too disgraceful to present on my wall. Antiquing is one thing, but this, as others have mentioned, is just too over the top.Quality-wise, I will say that it is well made and of quality materials. I suppose it's a decent product, just artistically terrible.(Sadly for me, I bought this from a different site without looking at the reviews here first.)"
3,amazon sent me the wrong flag,"I ordered this and what came in the mail was a nylon brand new looking version of the flag. I returned it and asked them to send me the correct flag, which they eventually did after about 2 weeks. With that asside I can agree with other reviewers that the flag looks too brown, although another reviewer recommending washing it once without any soap and that should lighten it a bit. I plan to use this outdoors in place of the new flag so I have yet to see how well it is going to do outside. Also I noted several imperfections including stiching being white and coming off like ends of a string at certain placed along the flag, it was cheaply made."
1,piss poor,"Says its fing antiqued cotton, got it today and its 100% Nylon I am very disappointed and let down .... a shame to America"
2,Purists should pass on this CD...,"If you're looking to buy a cd with the original pieces used from Stanley's films, don't waste your money on this disc. Of the 19 tracks, only 2 are the recordings from the actual film. ""Midnight, the Stars and You"" was transfered directly from 78 and was not processed at all to remove surface noise. The main title from ""The Shining"" is a cheezy re-recording that sounds like it was played on a Casio keyboard. What a letdown."
2,Be warned,"Also Sprach Zarathustra is a great tune, but the version of We'll Meet Again is not the same one that plays as the bombs explode in Dr. Strangelove. Had I known that, I probably wouldn't have bought the disc."
2,False Advertising,"I only bought this cd for the Vera Lynn ""We'll Meet Again"" song and it was another version that's not nearly as good. The rest of the cd is solid, but not solid enough to make me forget my disappointment."
4,A Wonderful CD,"When I saw this disc, It was like a dream come true. These are new recordings performed by by the City of Prague Philharmonic of music from ""Lolita"", ""Barry Lyndon"",""2001"",Dr. Stranglove"", ""Spartacus"" (What amazed me was it's the version of the Main Title you hear in the film not the short verison you hear on the MCA CD) as well as new synth vesions of ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Shining"" (This one sounds pretty close to the original recording).However the biggest surprise is a new recording of Gerald Fried's music from Kubrick's early films like ""The Killing"" and ""Paths of Glory"" and others. The composer has arranged this music into this stunning suite that really sounds incredible!!!!!!!!!There are also some songs like ""We'll Meet Again"" from ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Surfing Bird"" that are by the original artists.I can hardly wait for ""Eyes Wide Shut"" now!"
5,Beautiful !,Truly the definitive collection of music from the films of Stanley Kubrick .Masterpiece !
1,Clean your ears with barbed wire!,"Ever wonder, ""Just how bad can it get?"" Well, this is the ""it"" you may have wondered about! Categorically the worse compilation of film ""music"" I've ever come across. What music there is barely constitutes 25 percent of the disc. And you've probably heard most/all of it before (and before) in other recycled compilations from the same CD label. The rest is a vast collection of orchestral sound effects, orchestral noise, electronic noise, and just plain analog noise (the latter comes from an ""raw"" 80-year old recording by the Ray Noble Band). For a no-cost preview, find an old blackboard, and scratch your finger nails across it. No finger nails to spare? Try small garden tools."
1,"Worst movie i've ever seen, and yes I'm counting the Star Wars Prequels and Spiderman 2","I saw this ""film"" about 5 years ago and it has stuck in my memory as the most horrible experience I've ever had. After sitting through the MST3k version I was literally shaking because of how horrible this film really is.(Yes I mean that, I was actually trembling and on the verge of tears.)Even the guys at MST3k had a hard time just sitting through this film. They had to film their responses weeks apart because they couldn't watch the whole thing without it affecting their families.The whole plotline is nonsensical but it is so repulsive that you don't know why all of a sudden some men in sportcoats and Fez hats are climbing a stone staircase.The whole premise is"
4,High carb theory,"Most of the book reasonably covers the disease and associated problems. The problem is that the authors advocate the mostly carbohydrate diet which may not work well if you have Type II diabetes with obesity and insulin resistance. If you have Type II diabetes and you are obese, you most likely have ""thrifty genes"" so large amounts of carbohydrates do not make any sense to me to either control blood glucose or loose weight. If you have the apple shape you may want to consider other dietary options. I suggest that you use your meter or at least your HB1AC readings to determine what is right for you. If carbs make you numbers go high, then carbs may not be for you."
4,Lasco Replacement insert,The replacement for our garbage disposal fit great and seems to be working fine. Water drains a bit slower than the original insert but not a problem.
4,Short story of his works,"Book is about more his professional life more than his private life. After very short introduction his scientific life story is told through abbreviated sayings, speeches of his own. Since most of the text is from his speeches and abstracts you get a lot of his opinions and comments on various subjects including use of atomic power."
4,Mexican Spitfire,"Lupez Velez and Leon Errol are great in the first of this RKO b series.Enjoyable film where Leon's wife tries to anull the marriage of their nephew to Lupez, so he can marry a socialite but Uncle Matt (Errol) helps Lupez out.Great print and transfer to DVD. I am looking forward to watching the rest of the series."
5,Really worth my free time...,"I really liked the well developed characters, and the way I had a hard time putting the book down. I don't want to ruin anything so if this seems vague. I apologise, but really get a sample I think you will find its a really good read."
3,I like this book!,"I liked this book, which was quite surprising since i never really liked science fiction before. im eager to read the next 2 books."
2,Predictable and shallow 'formula' novel.,"I have to hope that this book is mostly the work of Ms Scarborough, it would be sad to think that Anne McCaffrey's writing has descended to this level of shallow 'fantsay for teenagers'. The characters are poorly defined, and the whole book overlaid with a thick layer of fake Irishness. I half expected leprechauns to pop up on a toadstool somewhere, offering to lead people to pots of gold.Considering the very believable and skillfully planned books that Anne McCaffrey is capable of (the early Pern books for example) this one looks like it was thrown together out at $0.0x per word. A pity."
1,pitiful,"Alas, Ms. McCaffrey strikes again. Throughout her writing, she is plagued by....bad writing. Her ideas are wonderful, and if only properly executed, could make up wonderful books. Too bad that she, and this book in particular (the early Pern books were not so bad) is predictable, inconsistant and sloppy. She might care to try reading her books and noticing the number of things that change from page to page. This is particularly infuriating, as it should not be so difficult to avoid. Unfortunately, she appears not to have made this one small effort. In this book, there was a) no character development worth speaking of, b) no surprises or involving moments, and c) much that rang false and superficial. Not worth reading, except on a desert island."
4,A Concise Survey of Swinburne's Poetic and Dramatic Theory,"Although Connolly makes some bold, difficult to conclusively prove statements early on--including the assertion that ACS refuted ""art-for-art's-sake"" in favor of purely social or political themes--the majority of the book is an effective tour of Swinburnian theory at work in the poet's verse and criticism. Drawing on Swinburne's critical essays, Connolly traces an emerging poetic theory with clear examples from the poet's most controversial work, logically establishing Swinburne's unique and unwavering standard of morality. The lines of Greek classicism are well supported in Connolly's argument, offering a clear insight into the inner workings of a poet whose critical theory is consistent in both his critical and poetic work. Swinburnian's will want to add this book to their reference library."
2,Terrible research blunders,"I was given this book as a present by a good friend, who had not read Bruce Alexander's books herself, but had had them highly recommended.Well, I have got to page 31 of Blind Justice (no mystery yet -- and the mystery just might save the book) and have been stalled by horrendous historical blunders. Tuppenny pieces? Please! Tuppence was two pennies -- two coins. It is like someone writing about 2002 and having two-cent coins. Muslin sheets? Oh dear. Muslin was a fine, porous cloth used like cheesecloth today. (He probably meant linen.) And ""tallow candle."" Oh, very, very dear -- what a shame. Tallow -- sheep fat, was the cheapest lighting fuel available at the time. It was poured into dishes when melted, a wick thrust into it, and it was used by the poor for illumination. Alexander meant spermaceti candles, perhaps ...Well, to please my friend, I will read on. But I hope the plot is a lot better than the historical background."
4,18th century crime drama Dickens would be proud of,"This was a great read. Set in the 1700s based around John Fielding, blind magistrate. He makes up for his handicap with his keen other senses and brilliant deduction. The narrator is 13 year old Jeremy Proctor recently orphaned when his father dies in the stocks. Jeremy comes before the magistrate accused of a crime he does not commit. Fielding ""sees through"" the con of Jeremy's accusers. Fielding sets him free and sets out to find an apprenticeship in the printing trade, a trade taught to Jeremy by his deceased father. A Lord is murdered and John presses Jeremy into service to be his eyes and help him solve the crime. This is a wonderful plot full of twists turns and wonderful characters. The use of language is excellent and plops the reader right in the middle of the times. The characters are diverse and captivating -- reminiscent of Dickens. I strongly recommend this to anyone who loves a good mystery as well as great historical fiction."
4,Recommended for readers of the locked room genre.,"Sir John Fielding (1721-1780) was a real person, a blind English magistrate responsible for creating London's first police force. Alexander co-opts this historical figure in writing a series of mysteries, of which this--Blind Justice--is the first.The story is told by an older fellow looking back on his younger days as helper to Sir John. In this installment, Sir John, in his capacity as magistrate of the Bow Street Court, is investigating an apparent suicide in a locked room."
4,19th-Century Retromystery,"The world of 18th-century London comes to life through the eyes of 13-year-old Jeremy Proctor. This light and enjoyable murder mystery introduces the compassionate, brilliant blind magistrate Sir John Fielding. The mystery itself, moderately easy to unravel before the end, is not as compelling as the fascinating cast of characters."
3,Good mystery - but a tad jumpy,"This is a good mystery, written (so it seems to me) in the style of the Sherlock Holmes stories. That doesn't lessen the enjoyment at all; on the contrary, it makes the story easier to read. And it would also make it easier to follow, if it weren't for the fact that there seem to be a lot of gaps in the story. I wasn't at all sure why several characters came into the tale, and where exactly they figured into it.But I did enjoy what I could follow of the mystery, and I was affected by the subplot of Sir John's wife and her illness. Sir John and Jeremy are two very promising characters, and I hope to see more of them in future installments of this series. Hopefully Mr. Alexander will improve on his ""flow"" in the next book."
4,"Very Nice, Enjoyable Characters, Good Mystery",I really enjoyed this murder mystery set in eighteenth century London. I enjoyed the characters of Sir John Fielding and his charge Jeremy Proctor.The customs and flavor of London during the times were well depicted with horrid smells and all. The characters were well developed and realistic. The mystery was a good one and I was surprised at the big reveal at the end.It was an easy read with good tension and I enjoyed the narration in the fictional account of Master Jeremy's memoir.It reminded me a bit of Kate Ross' Julian Kestrel Mysteries which I really enjoyed as well.
5,Napa Style,This little pan is very nice. I wish I could afford many items from the Napa Style catalog!
1,"MedWeigh MS - 3200 High Capacity Medical Scale, 600 lb","The scale consistently shows different weights. When you step off the scale and step back on, it shows a different weight. We have moved the scale to various locations without success."
4,Great little machine,"I bought this machine from another source, it IS cheaper here on Amazon though...anyway. I use it for my kids clothes and it is WONDERFUL for someone who doesn't have a washing machine in their house! Easy to set up and works great!"
4,Works Great,I bought this washer about three years ago and it still works great. I do not have a full size washer at home so this is great when I need to wash out something to wear for the next day.
3,Not As Convenient As It's Seen As...,"If you think this is the equivilant of a regular washing machine, it's not. It does beat handwashing, but it also twists up your clothes (not good for delicates). Also, you'll have to buy a rinse bucket and a clothes dryer or line dryer along with this product as it does not come with a rinse cycle."
4,Good product considering the price,"This washer is not perfect, but considering its price and convenience, I still think it's a good investment. I've used it for 5 or 6 times and so far so good. Usually I will wash it for 15 mins and then pour out water, and put another bucket of clear water to rinse for another 10 mins. The clothes come out pretty clean and easy to rinse. This washer is not very stable during the washing so usually I will put it in the corner of the bathroom and pull a chair in the opening side to make sure it won't move or spin during the washing. Without this little washer, it's a headache for me to separate my laundry with different colors, different materials... Now I can do laundry whenever I want. It's really convenient!I hope the future generation of portable washer can do rinse job, it will make life much easier. So far I didn't find any available one in current market."
4,Great Item!,"I feel like I'm taking better care of my clothes because this machine washes better than I can do by hand or by using a larger washer. Its actually enjoyable to pop in a ""load"" every other day. It could be improved with a more powerful motor."
4,Nice little washer,"I bought this off CL and really like it. My w/d hookups aren't in yet, and it's saved me from going to the laundry locally. It does a good job washing and not a hassle at all to use. I'm in Arizona where the air is dry anyway, so my clothes drip dry outside in no time flat. Definitely a worthy way to do laundry on the cheap."
4,mama's wonder washer,"the wonder washer was easy to put together and i was surpised on how well it worked, and how fast it goes. it is a wonderful addition in a especially small apartment, and can be stored in a closet,or under the kitchen sink, i would recommend this product to all persons interested in a portable washing machine. i am thinking in the near future of buying another one for my daughter. thank-you for this-machine-it has been a life-saver . thanks again sincerely applewine"
4,Does a great job,I decided to take a chance on this after reading many reviews. I couldnt believe how dirty the water was after my first wash.The only drawback for me is that the clothes dry with so many wrinkles. This might be solved by not wringing out the clothes before hanging them to dry. Otherwise I am ver.y happy
4,Great little Washer,As a mother of a [...] and a [...] who lives in an apartment I must say that this mini washer is great. I love it. I do about a load or two a day hang it on a dryer rack and I am done. I dont know what I would do with out it. Saves me a lot of money at the laundry mat!!!!! Just wish there was a mini dryer avaliable.
4,Great for felting knit items,I bought this to felt hand knit items and it works very nicely. It seems to be a well made product. I had no problem with the top (it needs to be turned so the tabs fit under the slots to lock it closed). I'm happy with my purchase.
2,loose screw,"I've had this little machine for about 2 months. It workeded great, provided you keep loads small. Unfortunally, mine developed a loose screw. With it being loose, clothing just sits in the water. I've tried tightening it several times, but it continues to loosen, leaving it useless. Overall, I spent more money purchasing this than I would have using the washer at the laundromat."
2,Wonder Washer,Was a Little Disappointed in. Not Quite what I though. Giving for a Gift Hopefully she will like it.
1,Think twice before ordering from As seen on TV,"I purchased this from As Seen on TV and was shipped a Sweet Machine instead. When I called, an employee stated the mailing labels are done in bulk and there was a mix up in my order. I told him it was a gift due on Wednesday 12/19 but he assured me that I would receive the item in one week by Thurs, 12/20/07. It is Friday 12/21, and still no item. Several friends have purchased the washer and love it. The item itself is good but beware of the Seller. This has been the worst online experience I've had and I warn people before ordering it from As Seen on TV."
3,insoluble dirt cannot be washed out,"-does not work as well as expected.-if there's hair or other large particles on the clothes, you need to pick them away first, otherwise they get clumped up in the washer.-clothes remain fairly wet after washing because there is no spinning of the clothes.-knobs are hard to turn.-power cord is too short."
2,piece of garbage,"The bucket's agitator is linked to a motor via a rotating piece with female grooves in it that catch onto a male ends on the base. unfortunately, for this piece of garbage, it keeps slipping and produces an obnoxious grating noise. garbage garbage garbage.garbage."
2,works in a pinch,The wonder washer is good if you only have one or two items to wash. Such as a bloush or a pair of shorts. Any think larger does not wash well.
4,Great for the purpose.,Wonder Washer does all it is promoted to do. It is being used in an apartment for small items between laundry mat runs. I would definatly recommend it to others.
1,Did not work!!!,"Wonder WasherI purchased this item from Get Organized on Amazon. The item arrived in the original packaging, no other box or packaging to protect the item during shipment. The box looked beat up and there was a slight dent on the washer. I followed directions but the washer never turned on. It just didn't work at all. I called customer service at Get Organized and they stated a return label will be mailed out to me in about 5 business days. A week later I still haven't received the return label, but I received an email from Amazon stating that they have begun to process my refund."
3,It's ok...,"It works if you really need something like this. I agree that the knobs are kind of hard to turn. It's really heavy once filled with water. I live in an apt. and purchased it to wash cloth diapers, but it takes way too many refills to do a decent rinse. This would be the perfect little machine if it had a rinse and drain function."
1,Need to get organized in packing packages,"I will not be ordering from this seller again. First of all, the tracking never showed up until the package arrived, then the package did bot come to my door by FedX, but by regular mail, which I have not had mail coming to my house in 17 years, last, the package did not come in a packaging box, I paid for shipping and handling, but it came as is. The box was bent and beat up. The item is completely made out of plastic and it should of been cushioned. This item that I ordered was a gift. I am bed bound, now I have to get someone to find a box for the item that I ordered. Get Organized needs to know how to organize packages for shipment. I will never ordered from this company again! I will notify Amazon about this horrible experience. I need to have my total amount refunded back!."
4,Does what it says,"I purchased this product after going through reviews. It's worth buying and does what it says. Thought squeeze and dry still your work, it does half of your job. Definitely worth if you have a baby and use cloth diapers."
2,DIDN'T LAST LONG,"I liked the Wonder Washer but it lasted only 7 months. Very disappointed in this product. I would not recommend it to anyone. I noticed something wrong when it quit agitating after 6 minutes. Shortly after that, there was water all over the floor. What a mess. Now I'm washing my delicates in a small plastic tub and it's working just find. No leaks. I threw my money away on this purchase. Win some, lose some."
2,Its OK kind of washer,I am not that impressed with this products. I wish to see some mechanism to drain the water. Its very painful to ring the cloths and then rinse in water.
1,Do NOT Buy,"I purchased this because the hot water fed to the washers in my building is not hot enough for whites.I put in 4 linen napkins (to bleach and wash gently).The motor spun the load in one direction for 5 seconds, then died."
1,CHEAP,"This thing is cheap, loud, noisy.. I would not recommend!! I ended up going with another product that cost a little more but actually operated like a real washer minus the spin cycle.. It held the same amount as this but stood still and had a rinse cycle.. This is just a bucket and a blender"
1,Broke after 3 uses :(,"Was really excited about this! Had no problem the first three times I used it. But when I went to use it the fourth time, the motor unexpectedly wouldn't work. I never dropped it, got the motor wet, and stored it as described in the instructions. So not really sure what went wrong. Unfortunately, this happened just outside the window for return. :( Of course. So if you do get this product, I'd recommend using it as much as possible while you still have the chance to return it!"
3,durable magic washer,"The magic washer is efficient, economical, and durable. I highly recommend this washer especially for college students as well as to be used for camping. If you are an African, this is very efficient if you want to wash bitter leaf (onugbu in Ibo language)"
1,Not very useful actually,"Pretty much the hand crank type of home washing does a much better job. It needs too much water for the amount of clothes you can actually wash in it. the unit I have gets hung up frequently while washing 6 pair of socks or 2 t-shirts. (I have even watched it hang up with the wash bucket removed from the base.) So I have to monitor it. Not very convenient if you ask me. Construction quality is not very good either. I have used it 12 times so far, read the instructions twice to make sure I did not miss something. I have an expensive bucket currently. The hand crank washer I have does a much better job. ONE NOTE: do not expect it to have a extraction cycle, this is a bucket with a agitator."
4,The Felting Washer,"I am a knitter who loves to felt, but my washing machine is a front loader - yes I know you CAN felt in a front loader, but it's not possible to be precise in how you felt - you can't stop it, check the felting process and then re-start it. So I bought this washer for the sole purpose of felting. I use a no-rinse detergent, so I don't have to rinse, and although the process does take a little longer than a conventional washer, this is not a problem. Unfortunately my husband hates the noise [but I don't find it loud]. It is great to be able to felt a small project without running the big washer. It certainly saves on water, soap and energy."
4,does the job,"Doesn't work as well as a standard washer, but gets the job done if going to the laundromat isn't an option. Make sure to put the clothes in first, and then don't fill the water above the top fill line or you'll end up with a puddle. Washes very well. My only issues with it are its lack of rinse options (you have to do this by hand and wring it out yourself) and the clothes tend to get tangled together during the agitation process. Still very happy with this and would recommend it to anyone who can't install a regular washer or doesn't want to spend hours at the laundromat."
3,wonder washer in afghanistan,"A nice little product, handy to have around when you need to a small load and can't make the laundry turn in time or when they stop taking in bundles."
1,Very Disappointed,"I owned this machine before and it functioned very well, later I gave it to my friend. I bought this for myself again and it only worked once and never work again...I am very disappointed...wasting my money."
4,Item as in description,"Great for individual use as myself living in an apartment, although rinsing kinds of becomes a problem since you have to do it by hand but it does safe me the trouble from going to the laundry shops. Note the size, as a female like me this can wash up to 3 tops at a time, or 2 jeans (but I recommend one for the cleaning effect ^^) One little problem is that when the item was just put into use the spinning part in the bucket sometimes could not stick close to the bottom, that takes away one star, but after several times it runs fine now."
3,Good product,"This washer worked well for two weeks. My clothes washed even cleaner than the laundromat machines, however On the third week it started making this banging noise and I decided to return it for a refund as I thought it was a bad sign. I would recommend it though, as it does the job."
1,Wonder it isn't,Washed one small load then shorted out because the bucket leaks! Totally waste of money I am really disapointed in this product
2,washer,It isn't what I thought. Its smaller. The one I wanted had a handle and held 5 lbs. You could spend rinse with IR. I dont like this one it was a waste of my no eyes. I have to rinse and wring out by hand. Wish I could return ot
4,The Little Miracle,"Hello Amazon, The Wonder Washer is a miracle for people who don't have room for a regular size washer. Or for that matter if you don't have the necessary plumbing as well. It is really nice not having to go out in the cold or hot or rainy weather to do ones laundry. Even though the lid sometimes may come off while in the washing cycle, but it hardly ever happens. Maybe a locking mechanism isn't a bad idea. The lid should fit better. Maybe a heavier lid is needed. On the video of how the device works doesn't show that you should put a rubber matting under the washer. On the underside of the base unit there are holes that water drips through. It is necessary that rubber matting is shown on the video. The washer sometimes spins loosely on the base unit. The knobs on the washer could be redesigned so turning them would be a little easier. I still would buy the Wonder Washer again if these changes were made. Thank you Wonder Washer!!!"
4,wonder washer,although not as good as a regular washing machine (of course) it really comes in handy if you dont have access to one. you can wash a pretty good size load in here and its fast. just have to get used to rinsing everything out since its a bucket and the water stays in there with the soap when done. but all in all its a very good thing to have in your home even if you are just washing small things like your delicates. very handy! and can be kept anywhere
4,Great little washer,"I bought this to take on vacation with me, but used it at home first to see how it performed. It gets clothes REALLY clean. I had a pair of my daughters muddy socks, and washed one in my regular washing machine and one in the Wonder Washer. The one I washed in the Wonder Washer came out cleaner in a shorter amount of time. I put Wonder Washer in the (empty) bathtub b/c there can be some minor splashing when the machine is on. You also have to make sure the Wonder Washer tub is dry in the bottom or the whole tub will spin around instead of just the agitator and clothes.Pros: Gets clothes clean, portable, holds a lot more than a sink and is easy to use.Cons: Heavy when full of water, you still have to rinse the soap out of the clothes, tub lid flimsy, and you have to manually drain.I would buy it again."
3,Now my girlfriend laughs at me because I WonderWash my clothes instead of using the big laundry machines,"Just moved into my first apartment for the first time.Decided to try and ""economize"" by buying the Wonder Washer, it's only okay...:( It's a bit embarrassing when the guests find that the clothes are drying in the restroom with a fan and the drying rack.when I dry it outside, it just gets stiff and not nice to wearnow in a household of 3 roomies, I am the only one doing heaps of laundry with the Wonder Washer^^currently waiting for the machine to finish rinse cycle^^"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This machine only worked for a few months. It does clean your clothes, but you have to dump the tub yourself each time. It's not as convenient as I thought it would be. Mine is now in the garbage. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Great,"This machine is easy to use. I use it to wash and rinse my cloths. I put industrial strength velcro (with the sticky back) on the bucket and lid and use that to keep the lid from falling off when emptying the water. After the water drains I take off the lid and add fresh water and run a short 5 minute cycle...I do this twice. I then take the unit upstairs; sqeeze out the small items and take the larger cloths, throw them over a towel bar in half and twist them to wring out the excess water. Then I place the cloths on hangers over the tub on a seperate shower rod and turn a tall fan on to help things dry. Everything is dry within four hours. Beats going to the laundrymat during cold minnesota winters."
2,eh gross,"Everything with order went fine until I got it. I bought a new wonderwasher as listed in the new catagory on amazon. So I recieved it relatively quick but when I opened it the boxed looked resealed and it wasn't exactly new someone had already looked through and written in the instruction manual and the machine itself was in good shape but I am not sure exactly if it was new. I mean this is a clothes washing machine, I wanted a new ""Wonderwasher"" washing machine as advertised not one that had already washed a bunched of someone else's dirty laundry before I got it."
3,Leaks even when at low water level.,"Wonder washer-It does an excellent job for the price. Great for be being in an apartment with no laundry facilities available. Leaks water spills over the side, if you don't mind a little few drops of water don't worry then. I just put a plastic trash bag under it.Just washed today for the first time. Clothes smell clean, stains came out, and I used the Organic Naturoli soap nuts in a bag for the first time as well. I am very pleased with both products.Recommend using cheap hamper with holes to put in bath tub to drain the excess water before wringing laundry by hand, then just hang up fresh clothes.Excellent until I move to a house, even then I would use it."
1,Will tear your clothes apart,"I purchased this a few years ago & threw it out just a couple of months after buying it. It worked as promised & I really thought I'd save on trips to the laundry room and money, but after a while I noticed that it's really tough on clothes.The mechanism works by spinning an agitator left & then right. The ""gentle"" cycle spins it for a briefer period of time in each direction, but with no less force.This constant forceful twisting back & forth twists your clothes up in knots. Sleeves get tangled up, any loose threads get pulled off & twisted around your garment. Even putting things in a delicates bag didn't help - the delicates bag got twisted up along with the clothes inside it.I wouldn't recommend this for anyone - my clothes came out far too damaged in this thing - any money savings that I may get from not visiting the laundry room would be canceled out from constantly having to buy clothes again.I really wanted to like this item, but it's just not usable."
2,Worse with time,"I have had this product for about 6 months and am writing a second review now. At first, I didn't understand the negative reviews, but now I do. My wonder washer has gotten significantly louder and less stable in the time I've owned it. It used to make a low hum and stay put while the wash cycle was going. Now, it makes an extremely loud sound (I can hear it clearly through a closed door, even with music blasting to cover the noise) and walks all over the floor. I'm concerned that continued use will be unsafe.This is not build to last."
1,"It's a ""wonder"" why we bothered to buy it!!!","I bought this machine to use for baby clothes when I gave birth 7 months ago. Well, after seven months the machine stopped working altogether. This is a total waste of money. It's poorly made, makes tremendous amount of noise, doesn't wash well and doesn't rinse. You will be better off just soaking your clothes for a few hours then rinsing. This machine is not worth buying!!! I paid $80 for the machine, plus $15 for shipping and all I have to show for it is a large blue bucket!!! Save your money!!!"
5,Wonder Washer,"I really love this washer. It does a great job for it's size and some. Less trips to the laundry mat for smaller items and easy storage. I use it next to the kitchen sink. When it is done with its cycle I just empty the water into the sink then rinse out the soap from the clothes, only takes a minute or so. I learned from previous reviews about using to much detergent and experienced it myself the hard way, learning curve. You only need a tablespoon more or less. I then put them in my mini countertop spin dryer, then place them on my quick dry garment station. I now have much more time to get other things done."
2,Hesitation in washing cycle,"I bought this portable washer in Dec 07. It worked very well until a week ago. I notice it became very noisy and then the washer cycle started and stopped the way it suppose to do. However when it would start the cycle again I noticed a hestation and a humming then it would start to wash the clothes. Presently it stops washing, hums for 2 cycles and then start to wash again. Can anyone help me with this problem? I don't overload it, I wash 1 pair of scrub pants and then the top separately. I don't know what happen to this machine. I really like it. I initially rated it 5 stars and now I've given it 2 stars. If anyone has advice please post. If I need to buy parts where can I purchase them? Can anyone help me save my little washing machine?"
3,What can you expect for a low price?,I used this little washer once. I put it next to the kitchen sink for filling and to empty it. I was aware that it did not have a way to rinse so I filled one side of the sink with rinse water then I had to manually wring out the water by hand. I am disappointed that the machine does not spin the wash load. I was hoping for at least that function.It vibrates quite a bit so I have to stand there and hold it down so it does not walk off the counter top and spill on the floor. It's fine for small loads of underwear and baby clothes. Anything larger needs a spin dry before I can line dry it. I have a drying rack that I put the smaller items on to dry. When things have not been spin dryed they take much longer to dry. I can't wring all that good.This still lets me stay away from the outside machines a lot longer and for that I am grateful.For the price I think it is acceptable.
1,wonder washer,The wonder washer gets clothes clean BUT leaves them soaking wet. It does not spin the water out like a regulare washer. AND does not rinse the soap out.
1,Don't buy this!,"I used it a few times. Doesn't wash much laundry, and it walks while washing! Literally walks across room! Also noisy. Doesn't wash well either (I used it for underwear, socks, pantihose). They come out soggy and you have to wring them. Cheap prodcuct."
1,Do not buy it!,"I will never recommend to buy this product. I was looking for a portable washer. I hoped this would work. But it did not. The shape of the handles is terrible. It was not possible to grab and move the timer . I could not do it. Finally I got angry and put this washer in the garbich. Sorry, but this is a true."
2,Worked well 3 times...now doesnt work,"When I first used this, i was very happy with the results. It worked fine, and it was very efficient. But after using it for the 3rd time, the bottom half stopped working. I was very upset because I wasted money that i could have been saving for a better version...Very unhappy with the Wonder Washer."
2,Think Twice,A couple of GOOD songs and then.... many not so good. Lots never heard of before.... Disappointing to say the least...
3,and it don't stop,"The real question is why was this not released until December of 2003? The song came out almost a year and a half ago. @ any rate, if you hadnt purchased it through the Brown Sugar Soundtrack, now is the time. The instrumental track is kind of a waste. I also didnt care for the version (track 2) without Common singing on it. Lastly, another remixed version of ""Danger"" that isnt that great. However this remixed version of ""Danger"" is not available on the ""Danger"" single and therefore this appears to be the only place to get it!! For the price of $13 something dollars you may be ahead to get the Brown Sugar soundtrack."
5,OK RESISTANCE,"LLEGO A TIEMPO TODO BIEN GRACIAS POR POR TODO,ESPERO SEGUIR COMPRANDO CON USTEDESLLEGO A TIEMPO TODO BIEN GRACIAS POR POR TODO,ESPERO SEGUIR COMPRANDO CON USTEDES"
3,Not the best choice of board game!,"Bought for my grand daughter for Christmas, she is 5 yrs. old and loves Ariel. She wasn't that thrill with this game and I'm not either when I play it with her. Don't seem to keep her interest."
4,Works good.,"Had to bend one of the center pins out of the way for standard newer IDE cables which have a pin hole blocked. Not labeled too well, so just guessed which pin to bend. Worked fine."
5,Jalin's Review,I'm very excited to watch this DVD. And cannot wait for it to come out(NOV. 20TH Yall!)
1,Weak & predictable at best,"Where do I begin? I really wish I could return this DVD and get my money back, but I guess I will have to just use it as a coaster for my drinks. Never really was a fan of Beyonce in the first place, I just don't see what everyone else sees in terms of her being a singer. She's way too over dramatic and comes across as phoney to me. Now if your impressed with a moderately attractive half naked curvy woman who shakes, struts, wiggles and flaunts her body on stage then yes you will love this DVD. As for ACTUAL singing and vocal TALENT? Save your money and buy Mariah Carey's DVD...You get the pretty face, the cury body and the struts and wiggles (without all the rawnchy stuff) and get this...someone who can ACTUALLY SING!!!"
1,"bad, bad, bad!!!",I never recieved my order from them. when i emailed them they did not return my email!
3,"Okay, but she's done better.","This concert was okay, but I think her Beyonce - Live at Wembley (DVD with Bonus CD) was a lot better. But even better is Destiny's Child farewell concert DVD. If you want to see her and her girls at their best, get that one.She didn't seem to give the same energy we've seen her give before. It's like she was holding back so she wouldn't tire herself out through out the concert and it seems like her back up singers did most of the singing. Maybe because she looks a little more out of shape than she did in her previous concerts.Also, the video is streched to make her look thinner (like Paula Abdul's Promise of a New Day Music Video). It kind of disturbs the eyes after awhile and makes you think you got a bad copy.Beyonce is a great artist, one of the best of her time, but this DVD did not deliver what I hoped it would."
5,the best of the best!!,Its so great!!for all the beyonce fans out there u must have this dvd!!its really a diffrent experience.THE BEYONCE EXPERIENCE!!
5,Fabulous!!!,Beyonce's performance was absolutely fabulous! She really shows her talent in this concert. Her vocals are on point and the dances are great! It's a great dvd to add to my collection!
1,The Video is stretched,"I demand Sony re-release this in a corrected version, the video obviously is stretched beyond what it should be. No I'm not talking about the Widescreen format, I'm viewing it on a Widescreen tv and the source is stretched vertically and is extremely distracting. I'm not the only one that has noticed this, as another review mentions this issue. Nice show, but terrible presentation by Sony."
3,Not bad; not the best,"While I enjoyed most of this DVD, I found parts of it to be annoying. Beyonce can put on a show but she left the stage way too much to change and the band played songs that are Beyonce or Destiny's Child related as she changed. When I see a DVD Entitled ""The Beyoncé Experience - Live"", I expect the music to be all Beyoncé material. When her bad started playingSo Fresh, So Clean,Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, And with Beyoncé mixingCrazy's lyrics in withCrazy in Loveit threw me away from ""The Beyoncé Experience"" I am supposed to be getting from the dvd. The interpertations weren't bad it just wasn't Beyoncé. Other than that, The DVD is pretty good"
2,The Beyonce Experience - Live!,"Compared to performances by Mariah Carey, Kylie Mingoue and Mary J Blidge I have to say that the performance and the video with Beyonce wasn't up to my expectations."
2,Performance needs improvement,"I like a lot of Beyonce's songs and her style, but the performances on this DVD were lacking. She demonstrated that she's not the best dancer, and that her voice sounds better when it can be retouched in a studio. Keep looking for other live shows by Beyonce, this one is not it."
4,"Great Movie, Disappointed Casing","Product was listed ""Like New"" and do not mention that the case had damage done to it. But still great movie and love it."
2,BEYONCE REVIEW,"AFTER ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS I THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR, IT WAS'NT THE BEST. I WOULD NOT BUY IT. IT THINK FOR THE PRICE IT SUCKED"
5,WOMAN WOWNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Beyonce!!!What else need to be said? Nothing else, She is phenomenal! Her performances are unbelievable. I already have this DVD, but want to watch it again. Instead of looking for it, i would rather just buy it again. The enjoyment is well worth the price of the DVD. Beyonce is now 30 and I am 40 and she is just Great! I want to be Beyonce!!!!! Not really, but if I was younger, she would give me something to aspire to be. The performances on this DVD displays her true raw talent! How did GOD bless one person with so much of everything!"
3,pretty good,"off the bat Beyonce has Personality, charisma and is a Fione Chick. she makes you notice. vocally she is on point. my only knock and it is a big knock is that the majority of her songs are just kinda there to me. she still hasn't made that One cut that i call a signature song. but she sings so well and strongly that she makes the material she does have, feel good and she connects with the crowd and never lets up. the band and background are all cool. Beyonce is worth checking out live."
4,The Beyonce Experience--DVD,"I would never really call myself a Beyonce fan, however, I did enjoy this concert... However, the concert should have been videotaped instead of filmed!!! What a disappointment..However, Beyonce's all-female band was awesome!!!!KUDOS for Beyonce and management company for using these talented musicians! I think that it was the band's music, not Beyonce's singing that made this concert successful!! Fortunately, I was able to see enjoy this via 47"" flat panel Sony w/ home threatre!Envally"
4,Beyonce in Blu-ray,"Exception picture and sound quality. If you like Beyonce, you will love this Blu-ray disc"
5,Definitely entertained!,"This was an awesome show from beginning to end. Watching this dvd made me feel as if I we present in front row stage. Costumes were awesome, the dancers were awesome. It was worth every penny. If you are a Beyonce fan. Amazon is the way to go for affordable concert dvds. This same dvd was in best buy for $29.95. I paid a 3rd of the cost.Enjoy!"
5,Hush,"Hush all of you...Not his best......ignorants....like you for example have ever done anything that would come close at least to his value....you crack me up.....Chris Norman's songs are the best...all of them.....all of you that don't appreciate him give us (his fans) a brake will ya?....geeze....anyway Chris We love you and we always will.....who ever loves always will....trust in yourself,don't ever doubt yourself...We trust YOU.http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mylove_chrisnorman/"
5,Amazing,"I am amazed at the high quality of the pictures this little camera takes. I bought it to be my low resolution, take anywhere, point and shoot camera. I was pleasantly suprised by the picture quality. It is much better than other 2 MP cameras I have seen. I don't know if it is the lense, how the camera focuses, or just the software, but the pictures are very sharp. I have also been very suprised at how quickly it starts up. It is ready to take a picture within 1s of turning it on. I have been getting pictures I used to miss while waiting for my old camera to start up. Battery life seems to be good so far too."
4,Tough little camera,"I've had a u20 for about 3 months now and I think what sets it apart form other compact digitals is its form and shape. I had originally bought a pentax optio S, but returned it because it always felt like it was one drop away from becoming history. While the picture quality was not as good as you would accept from sony (no carl zeiss lens), it was good enough for an everyday camera.You will need to get a new charger."
2,Deffect,"Sony DSCU20 Cyber-shot 2MP Digital Camera (Silver)+B2Well, I had two of these cameras and they're great when working ok. But the two I possessed had that SAME deffect... the pictures starts to become pink and the screen blackout and the USB does not connect to PC anymore.It used to be good."
5,When size matters...,"I wanted a camera that was small enough to fit in my shirt pocket, easy and convenient enough to take quick pictures, and that offered enough extras to make it all worthwhile. This one does. I have taken low light, bright light, movies, moving stills, and others and ALL have come out good. The only thing to be wary about is that you MUST get close to your subject or the subject will be too small in the picture. It is easy to download the pics to your PC. I haven't had any trouble and I'd do it again, but I'd demand a case to keep the viewing screen from being scratched this time."
3,A Fun Camera to have,"I bought this camera for my daughter who is 9 yrs old (An expensive present!).. It is more of a fun camera for the quick snap shot which can be downloaded on to your computer by a usb cable.There is no viewing lense just LCD viewer, fits into the palm of your hand, or top pocket . No zoom so not much scope for enlargement and due to a low pixel only suitable for the standard shot(However Sony Quality). A Quality gimmick not sure if it is a great contender..needs higher pixel or zoom."
3,50 -50,"Sony have done it again - reduced the size and managed to maintain quality to an acceptable level - the camera its' self is a sturdy little number, and simplicity itself to use - the pictures however are not brilliant, unless all variables are good - such as light - used as a 'second' camera, it's worth it's weight in gold - but for good pictures, everytime, spend a little more and get a bigger (Megapixel & size) camera. Want something that is always there and ready to go, this will do you fine - and with a little patience and practice, it WILL produce some great photos - primarily because you always have it on you and it works so fast and so well!Just be aware that it is what it is, and that is an excellent, if expensive, 'snap' camera - think pentax 110 and you won't go far wrong!Despite expectations not being met, I wouldn't trade it for the world - yet?"
3,Get a region-free player and check out the first three,"The first three Fu Manchu movies are the best of the Christopher Lee series and are also available as a box set from Amazon UK. So, if you haven't already entered the world of Region-less DVD watching then here is yet another reason to do so.The Blood of Fu Manchu is good, silly fun but nowhere near as good as THE FACE OF FU MANCHU, THE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU or THE VENGEANCE OF FUN MANCHU. All three are available on DVD in region 2. A sidenote is that the last two Fu Manchu movies (BLOOD OF...and CASTLE OF...) are available in a 2-disc box set in Region 2 for about the same equivalent price as one of the DVDs here in Region 1.I'm so happy to have the complete Christopher Lee Fu Manchu movies in my DVD collection."
3,The Frito Bandido,"Give Jess Franco a movie to direct and a disaster will be the outcome. My gawd Franco evens adds a poor imitation of the Frito Bandido to add ""color"" to this ""movie"". I love the Fu Manchu movies with Christopher Lee, and were not directed by Franco such as ""The Face of Fu Manchu"". But the Frito Bandido, even his costume was idiotic. What the hell was Franco high on this time? What was Towers thinking when deciding to have Franco absolutely ruin the Fu Manchu movies. Nevertheless, if you like complete nonsense grade ""Z"" flicks like this one buy it, but you have been warned!"
5,Good Stuff,"This cd was terribly good- ""The Ride"" was incrediably good...also the cd ""Everything You Want"" was extremely awesome- so go buy it- heh- if you don't you are missing out on some dang good music---"
5,The Ultimate Live Album,"This is it, Vertical Horizon's Live Stages. The almighty straight shot in glorifying their earlier hits with a live performance you won't forget. This has got to be my all time favorite Vertical Horizon record (alongside Running On Ice). Matt and Keith sing the songs exactly the way you want them to sing it, without becoming too predicable. Everything is executed very well, plenty of beats to get stuck in your head and repeat, and lovably strong lyrics. I can't go on to say which songs are the best, because they are all equally powerful songs. The acoustic and electric guitar sounds put together sound both beautiful and awesome. This live effort goes to show you that Vertical Horizon is much more than their ""Everything You Want"" hit record. Do yourself a favor; if you even like music at all, get yourself this wonderful CD."
2,I would skip this one.,"I bought this as a casual plinker and after tinkering with the rear sight for sometime I finally able to lower the elevation on the rear sight to make it so it will hit the 5.5""x5.5"" pellet trap at 25'. It still shoots high (about 1"".) The body and handle is nonslip composite. The pistol has a good feel to it and being a break barrel pistol, the long barrel helps. I consinder the cocking effort to be light. I was very dissappointed, considering EAA other pistol is of competition grade. mgso"
3,Too much garbage,"The title of this DVD belies its content. True, there is some good video instruction, but there is a serious lack of verbal instruction. The video is filled beginning to end with annoying, repetitive, bad music, and there are simply too many scenes of people walking -- some are repeated -- that teach nothing. This video could have been a lot better if it focused more on actually teaching instead of entertaining. The instruction is there and it shows briefly everything that you would want to know about nordic walking and associated techniques and exercises, but it could have been done in one third the time, accompanied by verbal instruction."
2,A visit to youtube would be just as good,"The instruction in this video is OK, but nothing remarkable. I think I have learned more about Nordic Walking technique just from watching the various free videos on [...].I was hoping for something more thorough, that really delved into the finer points of technique. This video often just glosses over techniques that need more exposition.Also it's a bit silly that the first quarter of the video looks like an infomercial for Nordic Walking. There is really no reason to sell people on Nordic Walking if they were interested enough to buy the video.Bottom line, I don't think the video is worth the money. But if you can't find anything else, it's certainly a decent intro to the sport."
3,great for crash or effect trigger,This is a very practical choice for crash or special effect triggering.It's kind of light weight so it doesn't absorb hitting like the Roland product. I am pleased with it as a crash cymbal trigger.
1,Excuse Me!?!?!?!?! This Book SUCKED!!!!!!,"Did any of you actually read this book????? AS a big fan of the Dark Sun World,I found this book to be a MAJOR letdown.Lynn Abbey threw all the established rules and history of Athas and dragons out the window to make this garbage,the plot makes no sense,her desription of Hamanu's past makes no sense(for one thing in the book she says he is only 1000 years old,but he is at least 2000 years old because thats when he helped lock Rajaat up!!!).The woman obviously read the history of Athas,but she ignored it when she wrote this book and that I just can't get by.SO if you love Athas and it's sorcerer-kings,DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY- IT DOESNT WORK,LONG DISTANCE FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK. SAYS IT COMES LOADED WITH MINUTES. wHEN YOU PRESS GREEN BUTTON AND DIAL IT SAYS YOU HAVE NO LONG DISTANCE SERVICE. wHEN YOU CALL THEY DO NOTHING. THE AUDIO IS INAUDIBLE. YOU CAN'T RETURN IT. IT IS AN UTTER AND COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY AND A PIECE OF JUNK
4,"Nice phone, reliable and works great.","I used this phone for years, very nice and reliable, better than the Vtech purchased at the same time.Voice is clear , and the wireless range is good enough to use other sets downstairs.I never tried the long distance card come with the machine since that needs suscribe something , I am lazy to read the manual.Never have any problems for all 4 sets.The only reason I did not give it 5 star is that the package does not come with foam to prevent demage during the transportation. But that does not affect usage if it arrived home safely."
1,not great...,"I love the Tiffany print/pictures, however the cut for each sticker is off kilter. So when the sticker is removed from the page, part of the picture is totally cut off. Very frustrating, and the whole book, every sticker is like this."
2,Not a guidebook,"Those factoids and stats you're going to bore your friends with when you get home ... you can find them here. What I didn't find was answers to questions, such as: Where are good places to camp? What do I do to enjoy my trip to the reservation, or a powwow? Where are the best places to eat in Hot Springs? That is, things I wanted to know to enjoy the trip."
3,A pretty good light read,"I enjoyed this book. I wasn't totally impressed, but I do like the writer's style, even if it does get a bit sappy at the end. Being from the Lowcountry, what I can't figure out, and what none of my friends who have read the book can agree on, is what exactly is the ubiquitous ""'eah"". It doesn't traslate into anything we say around here. It doesn't sound like a Gullah word. I can think of a few expessions that may be similar, but they aren't used that frequently. And while the plural of ""y'all"" should be ""all y'all"", it isn't. No one around here says ""y'all"" to one person. It's a northern misconception, and while Ms Frank has a definite way with words, and since she seems to love the Lowcountry, maybe she should actually come back from New York and live among us for a while, before writing another book. We'd love to have her!"
2,No Anne Rivers Siddons,"I have had a whale of a time swallowing this book. I can't believe that the character, Susan, would be so nonchalant about her husband of 14 years leaving her for another woman, coming back to sleep with her one night, then going back to his girlfriend, and through it all she remains totally unemotional. Where are her deep feelings about a failed marriage even if she didn't REALLY love him? And puleeze! Enough novels where the character has a perfect, beautiful, loving, teen aged daughter who doesn't mind spending time with her mother and never gets acne or moodswings? Totally unrealistic. Give me Anne Rivers Siddons novels about southern women, any day."
3,A great beach read,"I live and grew up a stone's throw from Sullivan's Island, and I was delighted to find a book that is chock full of the local color and flavor of Charleston's barrier islands. The author does a wonderful job of evoking the laid-back atmosphere of the Island that exists so close to the often stifling formality of Charleston proper. The characters were instantly recognizeable to me as ""true locals"",and I particularly enjoyed all of the segments set in the present day. I was a little impatient, however, with the parallel plot, a murder mystery set against the backdrop of the civil rights movement. All in all, it was an entertaining read-ideal for a beach vacation. I loved the voice and humor of the narrator-the author's real gift is evident in her ability to create such a believable and likeable heroine."
4,A Good-Feeling Women's Book!,"Although I found it a bit slow at first, I warmed to this book and its characters soon enough. It's a really sweet, funny, well-written tale of family, personal values, loyalty and love.I truly recommend this book to anyone who knows or has known love."
5,Magical trip to Sullivan's Island,This book was wonderful! The beautiful language used by the author was a refreshing change from all of the cookie cutter books on the shelves lately. Paralleling Susan's life (the main character) during the Civil Rights movement in the 60s and at the turn of the millenium was genius!Cannot wait for Ms. Frank's next masterpiece!
2,Disappointing :(,"Having read and enjoyed one of Frank's books last summer (Shem Creek), I thought I'd give this one a try. I'm a classics and sci-fi sort of gal most of the time, but once in a blue moon I like to pick up some mindless eye-candy. You know: one of those fun novels that is terribly predictable, with a low-readability level but high-interest. Anyway, I liked the first novel I mentioned, but this one was a huge disappointment. The characters are not imaginative and the plot is just weird. There's really nothing about the heroine to like as she's a crappy mom, a needy sibling, and incredibly weak as an adult. I kept waiting for inner strength to crop up or kick in, but it never did. After the painful description of her hookup with a man she barely knew, I just abandoned the book and deleted it from my kindle. I decided to read F. Scott Fitzgerald instead; now there's a writer who knew how to put together a plot with tragic yet engaging characters."
5,SIMPLY AWESOME!,"Thank you! This book was simply awesome! I saw the interview with Dorothea Frank on a morning show and something about her told me I might enjoy the book. Oh, was I right! I find it hard to get into my current book because I keep thinking about Livvie, Susan, Maggie, the whole cast of characters that you learn to love from the very first page. I could so well identify with the era of the book and the family ties, troubles, the beach, etc. It is a book that ALL would enjoy, in my opinion--men, women, and teens. I am giving it to my daughters. There is something for everyone here and something to be learned by all. I laughed out loud, but at the end, I cried a river because I truly understood the writer's feelings. Well, I think I understood her feelings all the way thru! It's that kind of book. Simply amazing! I will be one of the first to read Dorothea Frank's next book!"
4,Just a Terrific Warm Story!,"Sullivan's Island is truly a wonderful novel that is straight from the heart about family life. Ms. Frank's real gift is evident in her ability to create such a believable and likeable heroine. The novel is set in the Deep South and if you have ever traveled and spent time in that beautiful area this story will bring back memories of the ocean and marshes of the South. The book is full of the local color and flavor of Charleston's barrier islands and the author does a wonderful job of evoking the laid-back atmosphere of this area. All in all, it was an entertaining read that is ideal for an easy at the beach. I'd gladly recommend this book to all my friends."
1,One Star Says It All!,This is the very last time I will buy a book based on other author's opinions. I didn't like it. Period.
5,Terrific read at the beach or pool !!,"Dorothea Benton Frank is one of my favorite authors; and, somehow I had missed reading her first book. What a treat! It makes you want to go on a vacation to Sullivan's Island, meet the natives, see the places, feast on fresh seafood....Perhaps, you will enjoy the trip as much as I did..."
3,Save the pepper!,"I really liked this story, the STORY, not the writing style. Like Plantation, the author gets stuck on one word and uses it obsessively... let me quote from the book (page 18):'Eah. Great Gullah word, versatile like anything. It means here, yes, right now, do you hear me, isn't it so, don't you agree and just about anything you want it to.I have heard (okay and used, I still do fall into it easily, truth be told) 'eah a good bit, but not nearly as much as this author does. I grew up in the lowcountry so I'm familar with the dialect. My problem with this author seems to be that she tells wonderful stories, truly. Her downfall is that she forgets to pepper the story with the language and, instead, dumps the whole darn jar of pepper in there.Plantation had the overused ""Yahn"" and this was ""'eah""... I'm almost looking forward to the next one so I can see what word she picks next *laugh*Seriously, the story was good, but it feels like the author is trying too hard."
5,Sometimes life is a walk on the beach....,"Sullivans Island was an achingly beautiful,wise, humorous and tender story of a woman, Susan Hayes, who is going through a challenging time in her life. In coming to terms with all that is going on she shares her lowcountry upbringing on Sullivans Island in South Carolina, during the racially tumultuous 60's and 70's. Her mother neglects the children, feeling overwhelmed by the responsibilities of motherhood and an abusive husband. The children are instead raised by Livvie, a woman hired by Susan's father to look after ""everything"". Livvie takes charge and gives the children her heart and soul. Livvie teaches them about life and faith, in good and in bad times. This is a tale of coming to terms with who you are, how you got there and recognizing the past for what it was. This was an absolutely wonderful, heartfelt story. It is a story that touches your heart."
2,BLAH.,"I had interest in the book because Pat Conroy recommended it - and he is an author I have quite a lot of respect for. Sorry, this book was pretty much drivel in my opinion. No depth. Livvie was probably the most interesting character in the book. Not one I would recommend."
4,A fun read,I bought this book to get me excited about an upcoming trip to Charleston. It does a good job of describing the sights and sounds of the low country--both in the city and the beaches.Frank is a wonderfully descriptive writer who develops her characters fully and deeply. I'm already looking forward to Plantation...
3,Enjoyable but didn't knock my socks off,"Having read Frank's Plantation, I thought I would read Sullivan island to see if I enjoyed it as much. Unfortunately, I did not. Reading about Charleston and Sullivan Island is very enjoyable. The characters are very likeable and interesting. What I did not care for was all of the loose ends at the end. I don't need a book to answer all questions but I felt as if just one day Frank stopped writing in the middle of the story. It left me feeling a bit empty and unsatisfied. I would recomend the book but not emphatically. I look forward to more of Frank's work. She is clearly a wonderful writer I hope that her next work is even better than her previous two."
3,disappointed,"Being from the South, I find the writer's portrayal of Southern women to be offensive. Although the main female character was portrayed as clever and wise, she accomplished this by contrasting other Southern women (and men) as dysfunctional....."
4,Liked it!,"This is the second D.Benton Frank book that I have read. The first book was purchased at an airport when I forgot to bring something to read. I really enjoyed that book (mango sunsets), so when I was online looking for something new, I remembered the author and bought this book. Glad I did and will read her others!"
4,Enjoyable book,I really enjoyed this book. The plot moved at a fast pace with interesting characters. I would recommend it highly.
3,Ok not grat,It kept my attention but I felt the basic story has been told over and over. The civil rights angle was a new twist but the woman surviving an unfaithful husband and troubled teen age daughter has been told 100 times. In spite of the flat story line it was well written and entertaining
5,Sullivan's Island: A Lowcountry Tale,"I'm enjoying Sullivan's Island. I like this author---her writings are entertaining, fast-moving, and with a little Lowcountry history thrown in for good measure. This is the 2nd book I have read by Dorothea Benton Frank this summer. Great vacation reads!!"
4,Great read,"This was the first book by Dorothy Benton Frank that I've read, followed by Plantation. I really enjoyed them both, especially when characters from the two books collide. Between these books and Mary Alice Monroe's The Beach House and Swimming Lessons, I am ready for an exploratory trip to South Carolina. They both do such a great job of taking you there and really connecting you to the area and the characters."
5,Woderful,"This book is wonderful. All of the stories are spine tingling and once you pick it up, you cannot put it down A+ all the way"
3,The Second Lady,The Second Lady by Irving Wallace. Is a political thriller or meant to be. If read just for enjoyment it succeeds fairly well. Yet if stood up and researched it fails terribly. The plot is far fetched. The Russians are smarter than everyone else. The CIA is completely asleep in this whole plot. It would have worked much better if they knew and were attempting to stop it. Instead it falls to a speech writer and press secretary to foil the plot.The ending is meant to be a twist but if you read the last pages carefully you will realize the First Lady is indeed the First Lady.
4,A little bit of everything,"This book has a little bit of everything: Drama, sex, violence, compassion, intrigue, a twist."
1,Stay Away at all costs !,I have owned this TV for about three years now. What an absolute disaster...I am on my fifth lamp with what I call normal use.The tv keeps getting hot and shutting down.My newest lamp worked for 7 days and then quit.No wonder these DLP televisions did not last long.
3,Must be Lucky,"This TV is great. I must be lucky as I have had it 4 1/2 years and have not needed to replace a bulb yet, I do leave it on as much as possible as I read in the manual that it is better to be on continuously over a period of time rather then on and off multiple times in the same time frame. Don't know if that is the reason or not. I bought a replacement lamp a year after owning it just in case and still have not needed it of course now I'm getting closer to the 5 year mark which is what they advertise them lasting.Update 12/10/12DLP chip is failing unfortunately. I guess my luck has run its course as far as this TV is concerned.......Luck off"
1,Do Not Buy This TV,Had this tv since 2006 and have been through 6 lamps in 5 years and Mitsubishi will not support this problem. They state a bulb is only warranted for 90 days. There customer support is horrible. They are like talking to a robot. I am currently looking for a replacement. Waste of money.
1,Do NOT BUY this TV,"I have had this TV for 3 years. I've gone through 3 lamps @ $210, $190, 165 and now I need two more this year at $130. The picture is great but there are other TVs that wont cost you thousands in lamps. I am very disappointed in my choice."
2,Don't buy this TV,"I have had this TV for little over 2 years and have had to call for service 4 times. I've gone through 2 lamps a heat sensor and a color wheel. Don't get me wrong, when it works it has one of the best pictures you can find. I just don't like not having a TV for 2 weeks each time something happens. It also does this thing once in a while where it will not start the picture and then you have to wait for 5 mins or so and then ""try"" again. I'll never buy Mits product ever again. I paid a lot of money for this to break down. I should have bought a Samsung or an LCD."
1,Too much to replace lamps!!!!,"We have had this TV since Feb. 2007 and are on our second lamp. That's $500 dollars per year. I'm glad I have the no interest payments, but it probably would have been better to buy a more expensive plasma or LCD then this piece of garbage. Oh, it's the second one we had too. The first one was taken back and exchanged for one that would work."
3,disapointed,"I bought this tv from best buy feb/16/2007 right out the box no display model. i was blown away with the quality, great picture hd is awsome on this set, and the price was right. 6 months after having it, it beging to over heat alot cutting off automatically. now not even a year old the lamp blew. never had the problems with the noise like i seen in other reviews. i am really really disapointed about havimng to replace the lamp so early. i just hope it was a fluke the lamp went so soon. buyer beware."
5,Great customer service Great TV,"Ordered my set after comparing many brands, and then going to the local Circuit City where both sets wich made the final cut were on sale. Did a comparison of both and determined that the Misubishi was the best even though it was a bit higher.Amazon shipped first business day after order, was in Detroit area 4 days later and I picked up so I could set it up and use in less than 1 week. The only problem with unit is its built in sound. If you have sound system use it for proper sound. I am totally satisfied after 2 days with my purchase.Jerald Nyman10-27-06UPDATE: I have owned this TV for three weeks now and am enjoying the pleasure it brings too my living room. If this model is on your list find dealer who has this unit and others you may like so you can compare before purchasing.Jerald Nyman11-17-06"
2,Close but no cigar.,"I bought this at best buy cause it was a great deal. $2080. With one year to pay it off. It had great connectivity: 2 hdmi, 1 dvi, 2 firewire, 2 component, 3 s-video/composite. But when it came down to it this baby could NOT candle motion. It would break up and look TERRIBLE and that was the Hi-Def! The standard def left motion trails and that was from a progressive scan dvd! Great on paper but doesn't deliver the goods. I returned (b.s.-ed that it was broke to avoid a ""restocking fee"") and got me the 61 inch samsung hl-s6187. Now that's a frickin performer. Not as much in the way of connectivity but the picture is amazing (as good as CRT but way smaller package). So buyer beware on this one. Oh and the contrast ratio on this Mits is atrocious! Something like 545:1 !!!!!!The samsung does 10000:1 !!!!"
1,"Run Fast, Run Hard (AWAY!)","10 months worked fine. If you want to shell out big bucks for that amount of time, please buy. We are on our fourth lamp. Mitsubishi sent a local rep to assist...said he couldn't fix the tv. Still under the first year warranty and constantly put off by customer service. This is now 13 months and still a no-fix situation. Told we will be contacted in another week. This is totally unsat. I personally will stay away from any DLP tv in the future."
2,Bought this when it first came out in 6/06 but lamp and tv both out,"Really happy with everything...but not even one year and the lamp burned out and tv won't turn on. It's on about less than 3 hours a day!Very disappointing, thank God I live in Los Angeles where there are services techs available...just hope it all works out!"
4,Happy with set and with Amazon purchase,"I was a bit nervous about ordering this bulky an item from Amazon, but everything went smoothly. The set was delivered by a friendly guy who helped me put the set in my cabinet and do the basic hookups.Set works well. Picture is bright and sharp.I saved at least $500.00 by ordering the set here. I have no complaints with the set or the purchase experience"
1,Two Major Repairs In Less Than Two Years,"I purchased the WD57731 from The Big Screen Store in August 2006. In November 2007 the light engine died. It took two weeks for the tech to come to the house to inform me that he couldn't fix it there. Two weeks later, I get a call informing me that the parts were backordered. The TV was not repaired until January 2008.Now, in September 2008, the TV won't even turn on. I've tried the unplug overnight trick and the reset button trick. I called for service three days ago, talked to a machine, no return call. I called again today, Tuesday, talked to a machine. Four hours later, still waiting for a return call. I agree with the post suggesting a class action suit. Is there a lemon law for TVs? By the way, I also called Mitsubishi customer service. I did speak to a person, but they were no help. They said to call them after the service is delivered. I guess my next stop is back to the Big Screen Store to discourage their customers."
2,"As a short story, I think it was probably wonderful","The book originated as a short story based on an actual cathedral break-in in Dublin, Ireland. I would love to have read the original story--you can almost put it together from reading the interactions between the Gargoyle Paddy and Francis Templeton. Sadly, what fills in the blanks is a very interesting travelogue of Dublin and some history of Irish politics and church Reformation. If you're into reading that kind of history, you may want to check out a more authoritative source.""St. Patrick's Gargoyle"" may be a good book for young adults if you can find youth readers that can keep their attention on the book. Some passages are truly evocative, especially when Kurtz writes about Francis Templeton and his love for his old Rolls, Phyllida."
2,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That--could have been lovely.,"Up until 1/3 of the way through, I loved this book. Charming characters, & a wonderful premise.Then, for some absurd reason, Ms. Kurtz introduces a plot device that spoils the whole book:Because of a vaguely-defined & ill-expressed reason, anybody who personally witnesses proof of the existance of God, must die, by Divine command.How VILE!!! Ms. Kurtz has reduced the Almighty to the status of a common terrorist or hoodlum, ""eliminating the witnesses"".It could have been great, it ended in a fashion that was at best, unattractive.The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs DOWN!"
3,First Kurtz the Last?,"This was the first Katherine Kurtz book that I read, and while I was not `put-off' by it, I certainly was not impressed. The overall story was interesting, and I really liked the idea that the gargoyles were actually avenging angels. Paddy and Templeton were fairly well developed, but it would have been nice to learn more about Marcus Cassidy, the Knight, and Templeton's family.At times Kurtz goes off on a tangent about the Catholic Church, and the Protestant Church. While some of the information is interesting, it reads like a textbook on theology, thus does nothing for the story flow. It seems to me that the information could have been integrated into the story in a more useful way.The ending was very lackluster, and instead of being happy and/or sad, I was just relieved to be finished with the book."
5,great bag!,This is a great little travel bag. Attractive and plenty of pockets for everything; easily accessible. The magnet closure could be a bit stronger but over all I was pleased with this bag when I took it on a recent trip.
3,Travelon Messenger purse,"I was somewhat disappointed with the size of this purse. It is shown to have lots of room for many items but it doesn't have much room at all. It does have many different pockets to organize things, but you can't put much in any of the pockets. I would only recommend this to someone who only wanted to carry the necessities. Also, the strap that goes across your body is very stiff and wide. It irritated my neck after only a few minutes of carrying it."
2,Terrible...just terrible,"Well, I rented this flick just to see what it is like. The acting was non-existent. CGI effect was laughable. Plot was thin and predictable. The characters were a joke. The only good thing about this was Glori Anne Gilbert who portrayed the porn star one of the crew constantly fantasized about... OK, make that two good things... LOL! :)"
1,Worse than I expected,"I like ""creature"" flicks - even the bad ones - so had high hopes this movie would be at least entertaining. It wasn't. Much of the movie makes no sense (the creature can read minds and yet apparently can't?) and the rest of it was just a jumble of weird bizarre images that didn't gel. Do yourself a favor - watch Lake Placid and pass on this one."
1,BEWARE,"Amazon is offering this film along with ""The Off Season"" in a package deal. SKIP THEM BOTH!This is really bad simply because it is not a really honest attempt to create a decent horror film. This is as bad as those awful ""Brain Damage"" films.yuck."
1,BRUTAL MOVIE!,"What a just aweful movie. The acting is absolutely aweful,the CGI is terrible and the whole premisae is disgusting. I can't begin to tell you how bad this movie is. The dialog between the characters is unbelievable bad. I though to myself within 5 minutes""I can't believe this movie was made"". There is nothing redeeming about this movie. It shouldn't have been made for theater or DVD!"
1,Worst movie ever seen,"I've seen many movies in my lifetime and I can honestly say, without question, that this is the worst movie ever produced. The CGI and the entire plot is a joke. The only reason to watch this movie is for a strip-tease scene which was only a few minutes. Please, do yourself a favor and do not waste a minute watching this movie. Do not be fooled by the DVD cover! I honestly believe that they spent more time making an interesting looking cover than the movie. I am sufficiently upset I wasted money renting this :("
4,A rewarding read!,Follow Marshall on his powerful emotional journey while gaining insight into life and relationships. Discover the sense of empowerment you acheive as you cheer him on to face his demons and allow love into his live. A rewarding read!
3,Kids don't like it,"I purchased this under the advice of our chiropractor, mainly for my 3.5 yr old, who has sensory processing disorder, along with speech and language delay. The chiro indicated that his kids love this so I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, neither one of my kids will take it. :(I've tried putting it in juice, in yogurt, even orange pop. But, every time, my son must have known something was different because he would not eat or drink whatever it was that I used to try to disguise it. So, back to the drawing board for my kiddos Omega 3 supplements.I guess I'll take this one for myself."
2,goes rancid quickly,"For about a week after opening a bottle of this, it smells fine, but after that the rancid fishy smell begins and increases. This is despite closing the bottle the second I am done pouring from it, and quickly putting it back in the refrigerator. The peachy taste isn't so peachy either. I decided to switch to wholemega and have been happy about it."
3,Let's hope it works,What can i say. this is a long term investment in my health. Call me back in 30 years... to see if I'm still alive.It tastes awful. But I hope it works. They should add more DHA power to it. that's all.
2,Fishy for over 24 hours,I got this (peach) for my children and myself as a supplement. I had one tsp. and everything I ate tasted like fish for over 24 hours. Would love ideas to mask it better because it has been sitting in the fridge for a month now. yuck!
3,Questionable ingredients,"Some ingredients are questionable and are considered unsafe by USDA for some people such as:soy ( which is not labeled as non-gmo)rosemary extract (not intended for use while pregnant, and some other cases)d-alpha tocopherol from unknown source....I tried to reach Nordic naturals to find out about ingredients, but never got to speak with the live person...:( not a good sign for a supplements producing company.I did not have any fish aftertaste, but I'm considering to look for another product."
4,Very good for you!,This is excellent for your health and really the taste isn't that bad! Just the oiliness is kind of gross and sometime if you don't eat it with food you can taste it later in a burp.
2,Pure Health,"The product is amazing, however, Pure Health did not ship well. One bottle was broken on arrival and the bottles were very poorly packaged. As well, I was not compensate4d for the broken bottle."
3,Doesn't taste bad.,"My homeopath referred this product to me;doesn't taste too bad, too early to notice any benefits."
3,Too fishy,"VERY strong fish after-taste. Tried mixing with protein shakes as well to attempt to cover the strong after-taste, but no luck."
5,Soooooo cute,I ended up getting this in lavender because the white was out of stock. It's lovely and groovy. I know I'll wear it a lot.Very pleased with the service and the packaging.
5,RUSH working men DVD,"This is the new RUSH dvd working men,this is a gift to the fans who may not have seen all of RUSH's dvd's This is a series of live performances from the live dvd RUSH in RIO as well as RUSH30 and some recorded footage from the snakes and arrow's tour with previously unrealesed track, And RUSH are in rare form here with over 3 decades of material these working men AMAZE, just one question,got Peart?"
4,Useful and Hard to kill,"This hard case for Palm Treo 650, gave me at last the best support, my gandfather with Parkinson's disease let the phone fall every minute...but the hard case worked well.....the only matter is about time of opening....it gets loose because its door got loosening"
3,Great for the novice,"This book, of the 3 I purchased, is the one I refer to most often. It has detailed descirptions of each tree along wiht detailed instructions on care for the tree including maintenance, repotting, propagation, etc. Very easy to understand and has answered the vast majority of my questions."
4,Great for the price,"I drive a '99 Camry, so ""custom fit"" floor mats are hard to find. These Nifty mats are a decent choice.The material is closer to a hard plastic than rubber. It's completely smooth on the underside, though the mats stay in place fairly well because they fit the contours of the floor pretty closely.My only issue is that there's a cut-out underneath the gas pedal that leaves the original floor exposed which I assume is some sort of safety feature. Annoying, but time will tell as to whether or not a significant amount of dirt gets under the mat because of it.Also, the color doesn't really match the car. It doesn't match the interior trim, doesn't match the carpeting. I don't particularly care, but somebody might."
5,FANTASTIC,"The last great Sandra album in her style (the next was too un-Sandra-like). Truly, jems are hidden in here. Hiroshima, the ab fab title track, Johnny Wanna Live, basically all of them. 10 stars. A bonus track, the Extended Club mix of Hiroshima, is complete crap, sorry to say it. I so hoped it was an extended version, maybe clubbier, but I really don't think they could ever paly this mix anywhere. The original runs alone almost 7 minutes. Get this fantastic album, and look at those legs. When this album came out, in our store we made all the window to this album, with lots of vinyl cover and posters!"
4,demonic toy was a ok movie,demonic toys 2 was ok movie it was a little bit different from demonic toys 1 which the first one was better not putting down the second movie its just something was missing in the second movie that wasn't right to me but over all it was ok.
4,Turn Old Linens into Clothing and Decorative Home Items,"If you're looking for a how to book for taking vintage linens and sewing them into useful items, you've found it in this book. Moderate sewing skills are required, as well as a sewing machine.Some of the items are small enough to be made out of damaged linen pieces that don't have any antique value.The projects can be broken down into these catagories-Women's Tops, Children's Dresses, Gift Bags, Pillows, Curtains,& Simple Purses. These projects are nicely done and the end results are tasteful enough to actually wear or use."
3,Well done!,I didn't like all of the projects in this book which is probably just a difference of taste. I did enjoy the tips on how to clean vintage fabrics. I loved the christening gown suggestion and the vintage pillows.
3,Great music... lousy sound,"The music is excellent. Martin's playing is, as usual, tasteful, strong, expressive and technically flawless. Aparecida's singing is soulful, expressive and impeccable. The problem is that, as in most of Juan Martin's recordings, the sound quality is awful. They have added so much digital reverb to everything that the guitar sounds as if it is being played in s small tiled bathroom. As for Aparecida's vocals, he also sounds as if he's singing inside a small tiled bathroom.... in the house next door!5 stars for the music, one star for the sound."
4,Great for kids.,"I've picked up several Italian language videos over the last year for my 2-year-old son, and this one he actually requests! He enjoys the songs and has been trying to sing along. At first I was disappointed that it only has songs, but each line of the lyrics is sung in English, then in Italian, and then vice-versa, so there is plenty of opportunity to repeat the words. The songs go over animals, numbers, letters, days of the week, foods and some other basics, and the fact that my son WANTS to watch makes me happy, so I hope he'll start retaining more words. Just wish I could find this on DVD!"
5,Smartest Big Screen Decision You Make!,"Oh sure I wanted a plasma at first. Then I realized how I'm going to feel like a schmuck in a year for not waiting until the prices went down. Then I came across this ingenius Mitsubishi tv. I found out through the Consumer Report that this TV is hot and highly recommended. Then I spent two weeks researching it and discovered it is an absolute steal for the price. Finally, ordering through Amazon got me an unbeatable deal with free shipping and no tax. Now, everyone who sees my tv is in awe of its color, size, features and reputation. There's no question this is the best 65 inch tv under $2,500.00 that absolutely lives up to its reputation and amazes people with its fantastic picture."
2,Lots of problems with my model WD-65731,I bought this Mitsubishi 65 inch about a year and a half ago. I have had numerous problems with the lamp. With it being out of warranty I am now having to deal with Mitsubishi customer relations. Now I can't even get it to turn on unless I unlock it let it set reset it and try and turn it on again. I cannot see having to deal with all these issues for the next 10 years. I can currently trying to get Mits to replace this set. Other than that the picture (when I can get one) is great) I have a 50 inch that I bought in 1999 that still works great and has never seen a repair man. It must just be this set. I would not recommend this set to anyone.
5,Better than advertised,"I have had no issues with the delivery or setup. And the product has done everything that it was advertised to do. The 1080P is really nice, especially when paired with the PS3."
2,Good at first...,"I have has this TV for approximately 5 years. I really liked it when I first for it other than it is kind of loud, hard to get use to at first.After just a year I had to replace the lamp which is between 100-200 dollars, not in when it just goes out and you have to scramble around to find it and have to order online, when you only have 1 TV it's a bummer.Now for the worse part... A few months ago I noticed a little white dot on the screen for someone with a little case of OCD it drives you nuts, BUT... Now a couple months later there is 23 white dots and about 30 black dots so it can bug me whether I am watching a light screens or a dark one! Yippee! Needless to say I HATE this TV I think it's garbage and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
3,watch for shipping,"I just wanted to say that the shipping on this product was horrible. It was ordered 2\22\07 and as of today which is 3\5\07 I still haven't recieved this item. Everybodt that I talk to about the tracking number and shipping status has a different story, because of this problem I will never deal with these people again. It has taken almost three weeks to deliver an item 500 hundred miles I could have and would have picked it up if I had the choice. just remember this is horrible service and target logistics is a big part of the problem you will get no help from them at all."
5,Beautiful song!,"Here is a track by track review!1. All I Need To KnowTruly a beautiful song, with wonderful lyrics! I LOVE it! 10/102. Midnight & MartinisThis one is also great! Should have been on the album! It's amazingly catchy! 10/10Buy this single!!"
5,I can't wait for Sophia Nash's future books!,"I just finished reading A Secret Passion and I think it is a beautiful novel written by an extraordinary new author with one of the best romantic voices to appear in many years. This author's debut book is a gift to the Regency sub-genre of romance. With assured writing that combines powerful elements of sensuality, humor, and emotion, this writer creates enchantment. But this novel is not your typical series Regency which is more likely to have at most a peck on the hand at the end. A Secret Passion is bordering on the longer historical romances in its tone and scope. I hope this author's future books live up to the great promise of her first. How about spin-offs of the Thompson girls or Jane's brother, Ms. Nash?"
3,An okay read,"Was I reading the wrong book? From the glorious reviews, I must have been. The book was okay but it wasn't great. It was one of those books where you just wanted it to end because the silly girl couldn't make up her mind and was always running away from the hero. The fact that Jane had sex with Rolfe so soon after meeting him didn't seem to fit her character. And I never felt the love between them either. Oh, well, I'm glad others loved it."
2,Too long!,"Sophia Nash is one of my favourite authors..A Dangerous Beauty and Secrets of a Scandalous Bride are good books. However, I really did not enjoy this one. I liked Rolfe..at least he knew what he wanted but Jane.. I just wanted to shake some sense into the girl!! I struggled to finish the book. All in all, not recommended"
2,Where's the passion???,"I had such high expectations for the novel. A new authour, cool. Sophia Nash says she's been inspired by Mary Balogh and Mary Jo Putney, yeah, I love them too. And then the novel is even recommended by MARY BALOGH herself who said ""Warm, romantic, and sensual - an assured and impressive debut. I love it.""Well, I for certain don't agree. [...] Actually, I is not a bad novel, but somewhat dull I must say. I don't think Jane and Rolfe (what a name!!) quite matched. There was nothing even remotely heart-warming or sensual in it. Sorry, maybe my expectatipons were to high, but this certainly isn't it."
5,Very moving and personal experience,Takes you to the human side of the whole immigration debate. It is never black and white. I really liked her story telling...
4,Across a Hundred Miles,A very good story line. Grabs you at the very begining. Written more for teenage readers with Spanish vocabulary and possibly Spanish background. Very easy read.
2,Inappropriate for young adults,"This novel exposes the reader to rape, illegal activities and death. I would not recommend for children or young adults."
5,"cary cary, how I love thee...","I am a huge fan of Cary Pierce and see him live every chance I get. This is a great addition to your Cary collection. If you only know Cary, you'll recognize a lot of the songs he plays live. If you're a Jackopierce fan (I missed out on them when they were together) then this is the ultimate greatest hits collection..."
5,One of the greatest undervalued bands in America,"Jackopierce is definitely one of my favorite bands, both on CD and in concert. It is a travesty that such talent went essentially unrecognized before their breakup at the beginning of this year. If you like meaningful lyrics and a folksy sound with a bit of bite, you'll love Jackopierce."
2,Not quite the Real McCoy,"Although there is some good characterizations of the leaders of both families, the film doesn't really tell the truth of what happened. As the 3x great grandson of Randall McCoy (played by Steve Forrest) I hope a movie will one day come out that shows the feud in an accurate way."
2,look elsewhere if you need durability,"This watch worked great at first, but was not water tight and began leaking while I was kayaking. I would not recommend this watch if you actually plan on wearing it in the field."
1,Sleepy in seat,"Maybe I am among the few, but I call it as I see it, and SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE bored the heck out of me. Sure, the Tom Hanks character's wife died, and that's tragic, but his feeling sorry for himself did not win my support. Beyond that, there is not much of a story to hold your interest. I have nothing against blind dates. But if they expect us to believe that any sane woman is going to travel out of state to meet some sad-sack she heard on the radio, you've seen too many movies. Or at least one too many, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE."
3,Nice little movie but...,"I'm as hetero as they get but I've always loved romantic comedies. The premise of this film is touching and sweet but the ending somehow left me cold.***SPOILER ALERT*** (In case you're one of the 3 people who haven't seen this film yet)To me the central character in this story is Tom Hanks' son. He's the one who calls the radio station; he's the one who insists his dad meet the Meg-ster; he's the one who drags his dad to the Big Apple to meet her. And in the very last scene on the Empire State Building, the kid is waiting with his little teddy bear...Meg and Tom meet..and walk off hand-in-hand to the elevator leaving the hero of the story straggling behind like some third wheel. I hate movies with the big ""Let Down Ending"" ie. Best Friend's Wedding. Yuck."
2,Hey its in my backyard,"I got the movie because I live right above ""The"" house boat. So hey this was kinda neat. Apart from that the movie didn't really offer a lot. Most characters where very superficial and the plot was very shallow. Would not recommend it."
2,Very boring movie.,"Hi I just would like to express my opinion on this movie. I think that the only reason that people watched this movie is because of the two superstar movie stars in it. However, I thought that this movie was kind of dull and boring, not to mention lifeless. I was incredibly eager to watch this movie, but I was fairly disappointed with it. I mean I see movies about this type of mysterious couple sudden get-togethers. I liked seeing Rosie O'Donnell in this movie, though."
5,Sleepless in Seattle,"I have seen this movie several times now over the years. My wife and I just love it. It is a very touching, heartwarming movie which the whole family would enjoy. This is by far a 5 out of 5, a must see."
5,Excellent Movie...,"I had never watched this movie before, but being regarded as a classic by many and being a sucker for any movie with a Celine song in it, I decided to give it a shot. The movie was authentically funny. It had some truly endearing moments between Sam (Hanks) and his son Jonah, an excellent performance by Rosie O'Donnell as Meg Ryan's loony best friend, and an excellent plot line, out of the ordinary for most romance movies. As for Hanks and Ryan, they were undeniably at their very best; I found them both incredibly convincing; Hanks as a recent widow and single father, Ryan as an unconvinced wife-to-be following a seemingly impossible dream. Now, if you're looking for a film full of romance and ""gushiness"" between the leading couple, this is definitely not for you. *SPOILER ALERT* The couple doesn't meet until the last five minutes of the movie, but it's precisely that distance that makes the movie what it is, and equally enjoyable for a guy or gal. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,DVD,I needed to add this to my collection of romantic movies. I always enjoy watching Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan together!
4,Chic flick,My wife wanted this for posterity. I have seen and do not need. She is happy and completed the stocking for me.
3,A fun story if a bit too naive and incredible,"A tad too predictable (yes they were eventually going to meet and fall in love, we got that twenty minutes into the film, did we not?) and way too incredible for a plot. Hanks and Ryan are at least a couple of notches below ""You've got mail"" that will come out a few years later. Still, a fun movie for an easy light feel good night at home.You can get it pretty cheap on Amazon now, and it's worth a few bucks. I got the impression the two protagonists were a bit immature, while in ""you've got mail"" they had fully grown into their roles."
5,Excellent entertainment.,This is one of my all time favorites. I have to watch it every year around Christmas time. I actually purchased the DVD to replace my VCR version.
5,excellent,I loved this movie. I really like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as actors. They are the best especially when they act together. The delivery of the movie was fast.
5,sleepless in seattle-,order this and an affair to remember both are really good. love NY empire state building..came when it was suppose to seller was right on
1,Better get the older version,"Comparing tyhis edition, to the older one, I see very little difference, other than a gift certificate: They pretty much just changed the box design. If you know you will be spending $10 at Starbucks within a few months of this DVD's release, then perhaps you might want to buy it; otherwise, it is far cheaper to get the ""collector's edition"", which has all of the same big features as this one. You can find it pretty cheaply on Amazon still, and it is pretty common to find it in the low-priced selections of a lot of other stores as well."
4,Sweet Love Story,"""Sleepless In Seattle"" is one of the sweetest films I have ever watched. This film pays homage to the classic, ""An Affair To Remember"" in that two people meet on top of the Empire State Building and find true love.This film is about a widower, Sam, whose son calls into a radio show on Christmas night and says that his dad needs a wife because he's lonely. Annie, who lives on the other side of the country in Baltimore, MD hears this radio program, and thus begins months of writing, traveling, and wondering.This is a sweet film that makes you believe that you can not only find true love twice in your life, but you can also find it in the oddest of circumstances. I highly recommend this film!!!"
2,Very superficial and unconvincing,"This heavy-handed, unfunny comedy-drama was meant as nothing more than a tailor-made star vehicle for Hanks and Ryan. It's uneven, predictable, and bland. O'Donnell has a few good moments."
2,way way way WAY too contrived,"The point of this movie is that sometimes people are just made for each other, and fate will nudge them together. If you don't get this concept, this movie will BASH you over the head with it until you are unconcious. Fate will not be denied. Fate will kill spouses and drive away fiances to find you. Personally, I don't find it all that romantic."
3,Not as good as I remember.,Still a good love story but not as good as it was when it first came out.
2,Bearable but that's it,"I rented it because I loved when Harry Met Sally, and I thought that the talent might spill over into this movie. Instead, this was a silly, predictable story. Really, is a child who lost his mother a year ago going to try to find his father a replacement? isn't the kid grieving too? He sure doesn't seem that way. What nonsense.This is a good movie to skip. Rent it only if you want soothing background noise."
3,It lacks believability,"I love Meg ryan and Tom Hanks, but this story just isn't believable. They actually hardly ever interact. I thought ""You've Got Mail"" was way better. I think this movie was over-rated by critics. Meg Ryan's character was just not to be believed. The ending was a thud for me."
4,Good Movie,"Tom Hanks never disappoints. I love him paired with Meg Ryan as well. It's not as great as ""You've got mail,"" but it is still a good movie."
4,Good movie,"Another very good movie, a bit predictable but still worth watching a few times, good addition to my collection. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are almost always a good match and seem to do well here."
3,great chick flick for chicks,"Tom Hanks stars as recent widower from Seattle who talks to a radio show host about his troubles and Meg Ryan plays a recently engaged woman from New York who develops a relationship with Hank's character. The plot is a bit cheesy as well as the lines, but that is how chick flicks are made--cheesy plots and lines. Though most guys will not like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" unless they enjoy other ""chick flicks,"" most women enjoy this contemporary classic of long distance romance. If you like the movie be sure to check out the DVD, which has many more added features such as a music video and commentary by the director and co-writer."
4,Nora Ephron Didn't Write This Movie,"One of the reasons this film towers above Nora Ephron's other efforts is that the story and original screenplay were written by Jeff Arch. Ms. Ephron's contribution to the script consisted of tinkering around the edges, and a few food and sex jokes. I only point this out because Nora Ephron has a habit of taking credit for things she did not do. If you want pure Ephron, see the abominable ""Hanging Up."" As for this film, thank Jeff Arch with an assist from David S. Ward."
5,one of my favorite romances,"Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are perfect for these roles. Both are likable sympathetic characters, not overplayed."
3,not bad but not good,well this movie has its moments of halarious bits and a great acting job from hanks and ryan. but they dont really build up to their eventual getting together. they dont even see each other till about 10 miniutes till the movie is over. but still its not all that bad but dont ecpect anythinh special from it.
2,I've seen better,"So so romantic comedy, from Reiner who should know better. ""When Harry Met Sally"" blows this lame duck out of the water."
1,i'm with the 1 star people,"boring movie. weirdest part was about the kid who jumped on a plane to New York.I mean: ONE call by the airline company and the people in New York, would have stopped him at his arrival.total fantasy script. and some cut it, this one doesn't."
2,IT'S ALL A WELL TRAMPLED CLICHE NOW.,"I know everyone else in the world loves this movie. It is sacred to some people, and they would really rather that people leave it alone and never criticize it. I know that it is world-famous because everytime I tell someone I am originally from Seattle, no matter where in the world they are from... from New Zealand to Bulgaria to South Africa to Chile, they always make a comment (which they think is exceedingly cute) about ""Are you sleepless?"" Is it any wonder I moved to Iceland. (Now I just get asked, ""Is it cold?"") Meg Ryan is too cutesy. Tom Hanks is just too... Tom Hanks like. Clever idea, and it would be better if they had left this film to stand alone, but reteaming Ryan and Hanks for You've Got Mail actually kind of cheapens this film."
2,Disappointing,"Romantic love is a wonderful gift of God, but without a solid moral foundation that includes chastity, honesty, respect for parents, etc. it becomes misleading and dangerous. There are some fine tunes and entertaining moments in this film, and it is well made. But if I had known what was in it I would not have bought the DVD."
2,Hey it is in my backyard,"I got the movie because I live right above ""The"" house boat. So hey this was kinda neat. Apart from that the movie didn't really offer a lot. Most characters where very superficial and the plot was very shallow. Would not recommend it."
2,Very Sleepy,"Sleepless in Seattle is a very boring movie without a doubt, so many people call this movie a must see and say its very romantic. I think this movie really lacks excitement there are so many slow points in the movie it makes me dopey and very sleepy. I really don't get the main picture here of a must see I mean you have to give it credit though of making sense its not the story that is pointless its the way it's told the movie lacks excitement and thats very important in movies it was o.k but it sure is not one of the best movies that I have ever seen. When Harry met Sally was a much better movie."
2,sleepless in Seatle,"I was disapointed with this verson because it had subtitles which I didn`t want.I wanted full screen , I really like this movie"
5,Love this movie,I love any movie with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in it. This disc is top notch and was delivered pronto. Thanks.
1,"Get out that ice cream fat girls, its time to cry!",Easily the worst movie of all time right next to Fist of the North Star. This movie is good for one thing and one thing alone. Getting your girlfriend to shutup long enough to get a couple of beers down and maybe catch half a football game.
4,good film,i really enjoyed this film.i felt the Chemistry of Meg Ryan&Tom Hanks.i didn't know if Meg Ryan could be in a romantic movie and pull off the Chemistry that she did with Billy Crystal in when Harry met Sally.but she did with Tom Hanks.it's a cool Laid-back film.
5,One of the Best Romantic Comedies Ever!,I love this movie! Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan are perfect together. I love this type of movie where even where there is a sad moment that it quickly smoothed over so it totally feel good...like the old-time movies. It's timeless!www.pictureperfectphotorestoration.net
3,The Perfect Romance Movie,"Tom Hanks, one of my favorite comedy actors, stars in this wonderful romance story about a woman (Ryan) who falls for a widower in Seattle when she hears him over the radio. The story is great and the supporting performances from O'Donnell and Pullman are excellent. I like the movie because the Empire State Building is in it. A GREAT ROMANCE FILM."
3,But they haven't met!!,"This film did not sweep me away the way it did so many other people. I love romantic comedies, but this one lacks an ingredient that, to me, is essential. Our main characters never meet until the final scene! I simply could not invest any interest in a romance that is clearly simply delusional.&#65533;Sleepless in Seattle&#65533; has some fine moments, an excellent supporting cast, and a soundtrack that is used absolutely perfectly. It is a great film to rent, and a wonderful study of it&#65533;s time. But as a romance, it just didn&#65533;t convince me. When the two lovers never interact face to face the believability of a true romance suffers."
1,Don't bother,This book doesn't tell you how do anything. It describes how the DBA job should be done but doesn't actually take you through the steps (such as backups). This book is for a CIO that doesn't understand the responsibility of an ORACLE DBA.
3,silly but informative,"Entertaining for kids, but rather silly. It does have some educational value. The acting is rather fake and unreal. This is an adult perspective. For kids it might be entertaining."
5,Haven't gotten tired of it yet!,"I listen to this almost every morning over a cup of coffee and a journal and Bible; There doesn't seem to be a better way of starting the day. Torres' music does not interfere or become annoying as you do other things, but sometimes I do find myself just sitting back from the books and revelling in the sheer beauty of the compositions. I also recommend Humberto Ramirez' ""Aspects"" (latin-jazz trumpet)and Editus' ""Calles y Vientos"" (jazz/classical violin-guitar-percussion) VERY highly!!"
4,A reasoned voice in the huckster crowd,"My review title pretty well sums it up. Eldred presents a well reasoned argument for investing in condos. He provides solid advice on the pertinent subjects, including tenant and association selection. And he does it with an encouraging tone that doesn't digress into pie in the sky hype.I think I'll check out some of his other work."
2,Out of date,I thought it was a pretty cool book and goot for the guy who wrote it but he talks about buying condos a long time ago and how he made money off them. It was a different time and isnt really in tune with todays rela estate market.
5,A story for more than one generation,Back in the 80s my two children loved to have this book read to them night after night. Now I am visited by grandchildren who ask for the purple crayon again and again. A great book for the one and a half to four year old set.
5,Fabulous cookbook!,"This is a delicious book. I wore out the first one I had! Great recipes, delicious food!"
2,Not as I expected,"The book has a very brief story an explanation about spices.I was deceived by the customers reviews, they wrote about a book on the history of the spices and a few recipes, when is mainly a cookbook with old fashion, let alone, classic recipes.Not happy with the product.Nevertheless the book arrived in good conditions as promised by the seller.MiguelCulinary Spy Facebook"
3,narration,The narration was disappointing. I'd rather have Simon Prebble as the narrator as he's done several Sherlock Holmes titles already. He's wonderful.
5,"Just...just epic, awesome!","This one has a case where...well, let's just say Sherlock Holmes reminds Watson to remind him of it in future.It's full of many varied cases, and lots of them are...unconventional, and strange--just what Holmes enjoys most. I definitely recommend it to fans of the series."
3,Link for your FREE audiobook doesnt work,The link to obtain your FREE audiobook doesn't work. They didn't answer their email. On a previous order it did work and the quality is very good. No install instructions to be found . You end up with a load chapters in no logical order on the home page and that's it.
2,Misleading Title,"Don't get me wrong. I love the works of Arthur Conan Doyle. And this book is indeed the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. But it's not a dual-language book, with Russian/English appearing side to side. It's just an English copy of the Book, followed by a Russian copy of the book. Not good for studying Russian (my reason for buying this book)."
5,school resource,I love being able to get these older writings free for the Kindle. We are greatly able to expand our homeschool reading beyond what we can find at our library.
5,Excellent Kindle Version.,"Recently watched the last episode of the second season of ""Sherlock"" on PBS. It made me want to read the original story, ""The Final Problem"", which appeared in ""The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"". I found this free copy of ""Memoirs"" on Kindle, and it includes illustrations and a table of contents, which is important since ""Final"" is the last story in the book.This is a must have for anyone."
4,"Sherlock Homes, what more to say?","I had read some Sherlock Holmes stories as a child, and thanks to its sudden resurgence in popularity, have started reading them again as an adult. I am pleased to find that some things are popular for good reason.This collection includes two particularly interesting developments in the Holmes stories - the appearance of his brother Mycroft, and the ""Final Adventure,"" which involves Holmes, Moriarty, and the Reichenbach Falls.If you like any Sherlock Holmes, in any version, you will like the original. Enough said."
3,The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes Audiobook,"I love audio books. When you are busy and can't read there is someone there to read to you! This is a good read if you are into Sherlock, easy to listen to and since it is short stories there is always a good place to take a break. The voice of the reader suits the book well. This is the second Sherlock Holmes audio book I have purchased."
5,Good Sherlock anthology,I ordered this book because I belong to a Sherlock Holmes book club and needed this for our reviews of his short stories. It is well done; I got the book well within the ordering range and in great condition. I will buy again. Thank you.
3,Great collection of stories,"Well I love Sherlock Holmes and strive to work towards being as observant as the character. That being said, this book was not my favorite so far. Many of the stories were slow and easy for me to deduce right away. I did decide to share this collection with my wife and son whom is a year and a half old. We would put him in his crib and I would read aloud to them both with different voices and all. We really enjoyed the family time even though my son doesn't understand the stories. He did enjoy laughing at my accent and different voices so it was worth it.A few were great but my favorite was of course the Final problem. Even though it is a quick telling of certain events, that I won't mention in case I spoil the ending. It was very well written and you could feel the emotion in the story. My hat is off to Conan Doyle for this one. I do look forward to the next Holmes book on my list. Aside from Batman, Sherlock Holmes is one of my favorite detectives."
5,Interesting Mysteries,I have always enjoyed reading about the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Having this app and being able to read The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes when I have some spare time is great.
5,Great entertainment,Great entertainment jewel and it is free. Quick intriguing stories with plenty of detail to leave you waiting for the next adventure. The imagery in the details adds enough context to keep the reader involved.
2,It's not too bad...,"But it isn't something I'd read again. Decent for it's time but I wasn't fond of it. Plus, the random backstory about Mormons was a little odd."
5,Trad stuff.,"Even though this is old stuff to many, its well a read again. Better than many modern stories.Also evokes period."
3,memoirs of sherlock,interesting images of sherlock holmes. shows a side of the British that few know. helps you to learn new words and intrigue
5,Good one Sherlock,"Being a fan of the Sherlock Holmes series I totally enjoyed the book of short stories, and the illustrations added to the experience."
4,Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes ebook,"I have found the reading interesting but dated. I wanted to see what the movies were based on and some of these short stories are quite interesting. You can see how the attitudes and views have changed in over 100 years. Some of the slang terms used in the book would be considered in marginal taste in our hypersensitive 21st century world. If you keep in mind the day and age it was written in, you can get past some of the racial stereotypes and the comments on womens role in society (of the day).I honestly enjoyed the read, though found some of the cases intentionally vague so the protagonist can divulge his deductions in grand fashion, though you the reader are not given all the aspects that he ""sees"" when investigating. Far less dramatic than any of the movies, though I would highly recommend if you want to see the roots of where tales came from."
2,Missing a complete story!,"For a free book it doesn't get much better than this in terms of writing and the quality of Conan Doyle's stories. That said however, there are some let downs such as, the book is missing The Adventure of The Cardboard box, and the wonderfull illustrations by Sydney Paget that makes Sherlock and Watson so tangible. After getting print version of The Complete Illustrated Sherlock Holmes for Christmas, I can't help but feel that this book is a mild let down. However if you are not a Sherlockian like I am, this is an excellent book but remember, you get what you pay for. Tidbit: This was written on January 6th Sherlock's Birthday."
3,The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes was okay but having read before not the same impact. Might interest someone who has watched the TV series.
4,good read,I am currently still going through a few of the stories but they are good.I look forward to reading more.
3,The character that outshines the author,"Sir Arthur has created a magnificent character whom other people have adopted and evolved into a deep and well developed person whom we ahve all come to know by his various habits and idiosyncracies. However this has in turn surpassed Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ability to represent and support this character. his writing, though clear and midly entertaining, does not shine a light on the Sherlock Holmes we have come to know in film and on TV. Midly entertaining, but pale in comparison to the BBC version starring Benedict Cumberbatch for example."
1,Too high and lacks mid-range.,"I would save up and buy the Polk Monitor CS1 instead. It only costs a little more and sounds so much better. That has a more fuller and clearer sound to it. This Dayton center channel, on the other hand, can sound very tinny and high at times and it lacks that full sound. It lacks mid-range, which is most likely due to its tiny woofers. And due to these flaws, dialogue can be hard to hear sometimes. Don't buy this junk. Take that $40, put it under a pillow, and save just a little more to get something better."
2,Live from the Gates of Boredom,"This book was based (subjectively) on what is undoubtedly a fascinating subject and casts welcome light on the darker side of the Christian Right. However, I found Reiter's style of writing somewhat sanctimonious and self-promoting. Never missing an opportunity to state how wonderful others thought he was, how brave he was, and how attractive he was rendered what should have been an enlightening and enjoyable read into a book that was quite frankly, simply irritating."
1,Dislike,I really disliked this book. I'm wondering if these women even LIKE each other. They seem intolerable of each other and I find it has no redeeming qualities.
4,a wonderful comparison of motherhood over 3 generations,"This was a great book all around about motherhood, mother/daughter relationship, women at the work place/career, fatherhood, wife/husband and how society's expectations change over generations. I love how the authors (Mother and Daughter) took turns writing her perspective and seeing how the Mother's behavior/upbringing influences her daugher forever, and influences how she decides to bring up her own children. It made me think a lot about my mother and how her mother brought her up; and how all of our choices/decisions/outcomes are heavily influenced by circumstances of the time."
3,Columbella,"Good book, wish it had the dust coverbut a good read. Very good author andI like to collect her books and re-readGood mystery."
4,Best Little Clipper,"I have been using the Wahl Peanut Clipper for the past years to cut my husband's hair. I have small hand s and he does not have a lot of hair, so for me to ""buzz"" him down each week this is a great piece of equipment.I use to older one that I replaced to trim my five dogs when they need a quick fix , before the groomer is due to arrive, since it is small and not as noisy as the bigger models they don't get afraid when they see me coming.I love the peanut and would highly recommend it !"
5,Good stuff,I bought this for my daughter who's a hair stylist and she says it's the best. So who am I to argue since I know squat about cutting hair.
5,Great Item for small jobs,I have a Silky Terrier so this was Greatat clipping her.Does a Really Good Job.Not big and bulky.
2,Ok I suppose,"It all ends rather nicely, doesn't it? But do two wrongs really make a right, as is implied here?"
5,Beautiful Photography,"Bought as a Christmas Gift for our family. The book is printed on high quality glossy photo paper with maybe more than 400 gallery-quality photos of the wonders around the world. Many are truely breathtaking. I was tempted to read it from cover to cover at the begining and it soon proved to be a daunting task to cover the 900+ pages. So I was content to flip from page to page glancing at the photos and occasionally read the descriptions, which are simple and to the point. This is truely a wonderful book to own. I'd keep it close at hand on a coffee table or a bed-side table and once a while pick it up and let myself wander among the wonders."
5,"Excellent Book, Beautiful Photos",This book should be on everyone's coffee table and in every school library. The many beautiful full-color photos will inspire even the most reclusive to pack that suitcase and go! Very inspiring photographs.
4,Not a sit down and read book..,"I found this not to be a sit down and read book but a dream, reference book. It takes many visits, each one a brain adventure. Great book."
2,Too much disco,"I became curious about Sandra because of her involvement with Enigma, one of my favorite sounds. I read where Sandra is very popular in Europe but has not caught on in the US, so I got a number of her albums. I now know why she is not popular here. Even though her voice is angelic, it is often drowned out by the monotonous drum beat that never changes from album to album and her words are hard to hear. If the unimaginative disco drum beat could be eliminated from all her songs, I would change my two-star rating to four stars. Without that, she will never be hit in North America."
5,SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT,"To the fan from NYC, June 20: Just for the STRAIGHT record, Sandra IS German, and we all, true fans, know it... anyway, this album is the most representative of Sandra's music, however, you should also get ""My Favorites,"" containing her latest tracks and also really good remixes of the older songs. I am really dissapointed that Sandra had said goodbye to her fans, and I am anticipating her new-image come back... Let's hope that it will be a good one! =)"
3,My Thoughts,"I thought this CD was the biggest piece of Euro-trash when I first put it in. It has really grown on me since. I'm a huge Hubert Kah fan, and their voices are very noticeable in the background. She sounds nothing like on her Enigma albums where she's mostly whispering."
5,"sandra 18 greatest hits is a ""must have"" masterpiece.",For all you lovers of sandra and all of those who will soon someday here this angelic voice of hers will certainly enjoy and love this album. it is one of the most profound collections that she has made available to her fans. i recommended this album highly to everyone.
1,Fact or fiction--who knows,"I've never written a review, but was so disturbed by the quality of the information in this book, that I was driven to comment. I bet the person who wrote this would consider themselves a Progressive. No problem with any viewpoint, but then represent the product as an opinion piece. My first experiences with IDIOT Guides was that they took accurate information and explained it simply and clearly. In this book the analysis was so slanted, it became immediately obvious after the first few Chapters. I finally lost trust in the credibility and accuracy of the information. It's not a Guide--it is an opinion piece. I will be cautious about any future purchases of IDIOT Guides. Maybe they should change to WIKIBOOKS. Would like my money back on this one."
3,incremental improvements,"Despite all the touted improvements in this latest version of MS Word for the Mac, experienced Word users should consider carefully before plonking down for it. The chances are that if you are comfortable running an earlier version on your Mac, then there is little need to migrate.Though I'll grant that one new feature is appealing. The ability to avoid the automatic corrections and numbering does indeed give you more fine grained control over the document.Overall, consider skipping this version."
5,"Microsoft ""Word"" for MAC",Excellent software product for MAC OS. Just as good or better than the Windows program.
5,GORGEOUS,"These boots go with everything, and wear well!! My daughter has been very rough on hers, running in playgrounds and occassionally through mud (yikes!) but yet these still look like new after weeks and being worn nearly everyday. Definitely worth the high price tag. We love our Lelli Kelly's so much I have to fight her to take them off!"
2,Trashy and Mildly Involving suspense flick!,"This is not a good film. If you like Sharon Stone I recommend 'Casino', and if you like Tom Berenger I recommend 'Platoon'. The film could have been much better, voyeurism is a provocative subject but it isn't well executed in this film. You can see the final conclucion a mile away, and the ending is not satisfying. Rent it first. From a scale of 1-10 I give it a 4."
2,UGH,"Sharon Stone can act so it's disheartening to see her talent going to waste in this low rent follow-up to Basic Instinct. She plays a divorced editor who moves in to an apartment where the former resident had been pushed to her death. Who killed her? Was it the mysterious author? Or was it the mysterious man with a penchant for voyeurism? When you see this movie, you'll be saying to yourself, ""Who cares?"" The mystery is no mystery. The plot is so full of holes that you can't imagine they actually thought they were going to get away with it. The sex scenes are not hot or sexy. If you want to see Billy Baldwin nude, rent this movie, but trust me, his body is not worth all the trouble. You've seen better bodies on Red Shoe Diaries. This movie is just a mess with two redeeming features: Sharon Stone and a great soundtrack. Carly's Song by Enigma is a particular joy."
2,Well-intended but witless,"There's very little interest to be derived out of this voyeuristic, uncomfortable thriller. Almost every ""suspenseful"" moment is telegrammed and formulaic, the characters are hopelessly muddled, there are far too many illogicalities, and apparently Esterhaz threw in touches of dark humor that don't come off. Well let me explain the latter: the ""panties"" scene at the restaurant, the part where Stone and a bunch of friends at a formal gettogether at her apartment look through a telescope and see a couple having sex, and how naive Sharon is to the tempting William. I'm not sure if this was thrown in as comic relief or it's what AMAZON is talking about when they say it's unintentionally funny. The ending is particularly unsatisfying. This one is strictly for Stone fans."
2,Stone... Hot. This movie... not.,Back in the day Sharon Stone was the hottest thing in Hollywood. She is still very pretty and hot in this movie but... this movie is a turd. Billy Baldwin is a horrible actor and this movie seems to want to show Baldwins naked butt and hide Stones completely. I like Tom Berenger but he doesn't do much with the crapfest that is this script. This movie stinks. Stone is hot but you don't see her being hot enough or at all.Did I mention this movie stinks?
2,Ouch,"Stone, fresh out of a bad relationship, moves into apartment where the last resident was murdered and as she settles in, the other tennants start getting picked off by a sloppy serial killer. Sleek and stylish but the sex and suspense of the film are mediocre as are the scares which are few and fleeting. Does raise some eyebrows with the subject of human voyeurism. Rent something else, buy something else, watch something else."
3,not a contender,not a good film or a good sleasey one. no where near the suspence of douglas\stone movie or the nudity.
4,SOMETHING TO WATCH,I seen this movie years ago when it first came out. I am a fan of Sharon Stone because she know how to protray a character well. This movie is really great because of what is going on is the world today. I will not tell the story but watch it and you will be amazed of what happens.Two great actors Sharon Stone and Willaim Baldwin make the movie a collectors item.Sliver (Unrated Edition)
4,Sliver,Erotic thriller drama movie with lots of action and great acting. Recomend it if you like action with a twist.
4,Sliver,"This is quite a good Sexual Thriller. There are some red herrings in the film and some tense moments. Performances by Stone, Baldwin and Berenger are good. I would have liked to have seen as extras the original ending filmed (which test audiences hated so much it had to be changed) on the dvd and the original trailer(which contained scenes that were not in the film). The book and film did have different endings. With the exception of the end which is rushed and doesn't go into detail for the killers motives it is an enjoyable sexual thriller and a good follow up to Basic Instinct from Sharon Stone."
2,The Patriot Act in an apartment building?,"I just don't know about these Baldwin boys, so here this one is in this apartment complex and he is watching everyone on these television screens. Then yeah he does bed down Sharon Stone but by now we have all seen basic instinct so we are expecting the Douglas clan to come and join in on the fun. I guess if you want to see this guy get it on with her that is fine, but really people it is scary that they are watching you know? And I mean this film is dated because now we all have Google Earth anyways so we really do not need the millions of tv screens in the dark room effect."
3,What does Unrated Edition mean?,"I have the ""Unrated Edition"" but I can't figure out what that is supposed to mean. There are no special features, no content that would merit a rating more restrictive than R. I don't get it.I understand the ending is different from the book and apparently some of the famous plot holes would not be if the book's ending was used."
5,Little Girl...,"Pienso que es uno de los álbumes más lindos y conmovedores que ella hizo, y un clásico de la música pop de los 80. Por eso, no debe faltar en ninguna colección de música de este período, y recomiendo comprar el cd."
5,A mustbuy!,"Just Great! It's good for everyone, no matter what kind of music one hears. Filled with BIG hits such as maria magdalena, in the heat of the night, little girl and with sandra's songs hard to find in any other compilation.! Simply a Mustbuy!"
3,Eh...,"This CD is okay, but I don't find it as transformative as I've found other Sufi music, which sadly I do not know the names of those artists. The singer has a lovely voice and the instruments are well played but it definitely did not put me in the required state for whirling meditation which I have experience elsewhere."
3,Very repetitive if you're not actually meditating,"It says on the cover, ""Music for whirling meditation"". Remember that when listening to it. Unless you're actually meditating, the tracks are going to sound extremely repetitive. I created short versions of the tracks, for casual enjoyment."
1,I'd gladly trade this album for....,".... ANY Tori Amos CD!!! This woman has a nice voice, can write some nice melodies - but this album is really a let-down! Some of the songs are pretty, but then she sings off key all of a sudden! What a waste.... Some review wrote that this is what Tori Amos would have sounded like if she had not become famous - well, I am glad she became famous then!"
4,Basic Advice for Dad's,"Easy reading, encouraging advice for Dad's everywhere. Thought provoking. If you Like Tim Hansel, you'll like this book."
4,"Book explains variation, statistics & makes sense","This book was easy to read, short, and makes sense of statistics and how variation is the antithesis of continuous improvement. Good Read."
4,"Interpreting data is about the patterns, not the points","This is not a book for people looking for the technical detail of data analysis or statistical process control. The pearl in this book is the message that interpreting your data (such as KPIs or performance measures) is about looking at patterns, not at individual points. It's a book that can be read by people not interested in the technical stuff (such as managers or executives) - and it *should* be read by these people. We have to move beyond the days of comparing this month to last month to judge business performance, and this book is a great step in the right direction!"
2,Listen to MatSi review,"This book is very superficial and of little value. This book was passed out to the development team at my company as something everyone should read. I read it and was shocked at how little content was in it. As put forth in MatSi's review, the message is basically plot everything. This book is basically advertisement for SPC. SPC is a good thing, but this book does little to further one's knowledge. It's rating is not justified and I just had to add a negative review to make more people really question the value of this book."
5,Review,"My order came in complete, damage free, and actualy shipped early. I'm very satisfied with this purchase through Amazon."
2,Very superficial,"Wheeler has only one premise: plot everything on an XmR chart and watch for outliers or trends. The entire book has very little other technical suggestions for data analysis. Wheeler's mathematical detail is extremely weak. For example, he doesn't show where any of the multiplicative factors come from nor does he give references. The same depth of knowledge can be gained in 10 minutes with a Google search."
5,"Nonpareil reasoning, housed within the acme of moral worth!","Wheeler has given given us a new paradigm for thought; at once his veiled symbolism and implaccable zeal for laconic precision create a world that is as ersatz as it is tangible. This is undeniably a paramount work (art?), and serves as nothing short of the ""cogito ego sum"" of the Continual Improvement Specialist. Wheeler is the paripatetic busker of theory in the world where the surfeit of knowledge is a denizens' call to arms. At best the prose glows with sacrosanct incandescence, at worst it serves as a timeless and cathartic aria. Bravo!"
5,Deming for Dummies,"Wheeler serves up the best concise easily understood description I have ever seen for both statistical process control and the Deming management philosophy. No executive or manager responsible for imporving an organization can afford ignorance of the information in this compact volume. A leader blessed with competent statisticians may find that Wheeler's book suffices without other material covering the matter in greater depth. Leaders lacking support from statistically sophisticated staff may feel a need to stiffen their understanding with Deming's _Out of the Crisis_ and _The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education_. Even without a thorough understanding of continuous improvement philosophy, Wheeler's book, properly applied to your business, should easily offer an RoI well over 1,000,000%."
2,"Not that fun to read. Also, abridged.","I didn't realize this book is abridged from the original version. However, it's still quite long. I wanted to like it because I remember having a copy around as a child, but it isn't very fun to read to my son. The illustrations are cute, though."
2,pokey little puppy,I bought this for my 3 year old grandson ( my first kindle purchase) he loves the story but prefers a real bookwith coloured pictures ect.
3,"A cute classic, but may send mixed signals to kids","I bought this book because I had happy memories of reading little golden books when I was a child. The story is well written and the pictures are very cute. The kids love the repetitive nature of the story.But I had some concerns after I read the story. The story shows that the puppy is rewarded for being ""poky"" the first four iterations of the story, and then punished the last iteration after the other puppies catch on to what he's been doing. So the message it seems to send to kids is ""if you misbehave, you can get away with it by letting others take the blame and you can even get a reward if you're careful about how you do it."" My 3 year old has read it many times, and I don't know if its impacted his behavior. But it just left a bad taste in my mouth."
3,Little Golden Books...a bit dusty,"I think you can place ""The Poky Little Puppy"" in the classic category for children's books. But like classic novels such as Moby Dick, they are from a generation that tends to be a bit on the dry side. I preferred reading the independent author Kindle-only books such asAnne's Amazing Animal Alphabet,The Empty Cup, andWhat Could it Be?as they tend to be fresh, original, and not something I can pick up in a garage sale for a dime. Unlike the books I've mentioned, The Poky Little Puppy felt like work to read to my children."
3,Find Better Reads for both children and adults,"I am a booklover, but not this story. Although my daughter did enjoy this story, I must say I cringed every time she asked me to read it to her. With all the terrific books out there, although kids do seem to enjoy this, albeit before quickly growing out of it, there are far better books out there for kids."
2,Drives me Crazy!,"First off I will have to say that my 4 year old loves this story so much we read it constantly. It is driving me crazy that this is one of the best selling childrens books of all time and only four of the five puppies are named. It makes a point to repeatedly talk about the four other puppies being on top of the hill and not knowing where the poky little puppy is. ""What is he doing?"" the FOUR little puppies asked each other. So down they went roly-poly, pell-mell, tumble-bumble..... Ok that is only three puppies named and the other puppies name is never mentioned. I don't know why this bothers me so much but after the hundredth time of reading this I am ready to throw it away. Please what is the other puppies name lol I need to know cuz it's keeping me up at night!"
2,Not the book from my youth,"I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It seems flimsy and not of the quality I remember from when I was a child. In fact, the cover isn't as wide as the book pages, so they stick out and are sure to get tattered with time. Since it was only a few bucks I might try to find another copy that is of better quality."
3,The Poky LIttle Puppy,I remembered this book from when I was younger and wanted my child to have the book. the book was not quite like I remembered it but still a cute story.
5,Pokey Little Puppy,Pokey Little Puppy was a favorite of my four children over 50 years ago and now I am buying the classic Pokey Little Puppy for Great-Grandchildren. It is super with a great lesson.
4,"normally, audio ""sound bite"" books are silly, but not this one",the sounds that go with the story are absolutely irresistible! and the story is darling- perfect for adult-kid interaction
5,very pleased,"The Poky Little Puppy was a gift, as a memory of early childhood days.The recipient was thrilled with it; and it arrived in excellent condition."
5,nice book & cd set,"This is a nice, classic book and CD set. I am a new first grade teacher trying to build my listening library with my own money. This was an excellent purchase. The book and CD were new and in a nice plastic sleeve. I am very pleased with it!"
4,"This is a classic, but...","But it's not my favorite. The illustrations are lovely and soft. The story, however, is a little lengthy for my taste. I owned it as a child; I own it now. Who doesn't?"
5,Happy to get original story!,Bought one for my granddaughter because it was her mom's favorite book as a child only to discover they changed the story. Very happy to get original story!
5,"An endearing, enduring favorite","The Poky Little Puppy is one of the greatest children's books of all time. The illustrations are beautiful, and the story is fun. There is a good lesson buried in it as well. I have purchased many copies of this book over the years to give to small children. They all love it."
1,My mistake,"Very diappointed that this didn't work with Windows Vista. My own fault, I just ""assumed"" it would when I bought it. Now it sits, open and unsuable, in my drawer. Learned my lesson!"
5,Excellent strings,Good product. High durability. Excellent Quality of sound. I highly recommended for any bass. These are one of the best I tried.
4,Great strings,Got a sample pack for free at SXSW a couple of years ago. I've tried several brands over the last 23 years and have generally preferred GHS Bass Boomers. These strings sound better and last way longer. I'm loving them and keep buying them.
4,"Homa, homa, homa!","To tell you the truth, I haven't really seen many musicals from the 50's! I'd been too busy watching ones from the early 80's!I didn't hire the video until after I saw the musical performed on stage in the modest little town of Wangaratta, Victoria. I loved the show, the music and the story, so naturally I thought I better check out the vid!I think it actually works better on stage. The actors were better able to gauge the audience's reactions and play on that. Plus, they sang ""Oklahoma"" about five times due to the encores!Of course the movie is also gorgeous though and I'm definitely gonna hire out more musicals from that era, and of that ilk. It made me wish I was a local yokel living in Oklahoma... spending my days singing and trying to encourage the farmer and the cowman to get along! The jokes are very cute. Nothing much really happens, yet you find yourself on a fun and intriguing ride that leaves quite a smile on your face!"
3,todd ao version has better voice,"i watched the both version and todd ao version has musch better tone,the original tone of voice and its visuals are not as bad as mentioned."
5,Wonderful!,"If you are a fan of musicals, then this is definitely one of the ultimates in musical taste and talent. Watch and enjoy!"
4,Oklahoma is OK!,"My friends who don't ""get"" musicals often lament about the breaking into song at the drop of a hat thing. I love it. Music so often expresses how I feel better than I could just say with words.One detriment about many movie musicals is that often the actors aren't primarily singers. That's what I love about Shirley Jones and Julie Andrews movies - they are really fantastic singers.Gordon MacRae was also tremendous. He and Shirley made a beautiful couple.Rod Steiger was nominated for his role in ""On the Waterfront"" in 1955, but he also deserved it for his menacing Jud Fry."
4,"Great video presentation, Sound continues to lack","I have seen the musical Oklahoma many, many times. However, it has never looked so good. DVD has done wonders with stunning visuals and brilliant colors. Yet the sound for the Musical was rather dissmal. I was very disappointed. To be watching something so beautiful and to have the sound so miserable was a let down. Otherwise, it is a great movie and a DVD must have."
1,20th Century Ripoff!!!,"I specifically waited to buy this on DVD hoping to get a Todd-AO version and not just the Cinemascope version. The freaking Laserdisc looks better than this! I, for one, will not be buying any more ""special editions"" without reading the reviews in Amazon or elsewhere when it comes to 20th Century ripoff. This release reminds me of all the 20Th Laserdiscs that were first released when laser was just starting out and how poorly the transfers were treated...now it seems we're right back to the good old bad transfer days of yore. Yuk, I recommend that no one buy ANY of their discs (especially the upcoming crappy versions of STAR WARS non-anamorphic, non-5.1 sound original movies). These people suck big time!t"
