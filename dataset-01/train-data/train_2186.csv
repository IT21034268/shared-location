3,great crisps beware short shelf life,"I really like these crisps, they taste delicious and are supposed to be healthier than chips....however, I was surprised to see that these 12 packs were sent with less than 5 months from their expiration date. I feel this information should be available or signaled to customers before it is sent. I had already opened a bag when I realised the short shelf life and therefore did not think it was worth returning. I will no longer buy these online unless I can see the expiration date."
3,"Tasty, but not really a healthy snack","These have a nice pea flavor and are tasty. However, I can't see how these are much better for you than potato chips (the only difference is really a pea vs. a potato, as they have about the same amount of fat.) They claim they are baked but they are very oily. Eating a serving or two of steamed peas would be a much healthier, and perhaps tastier, way of snacking."
2,Must Have Changed the Recipe or Manufacturing Process,"My friend gave me a bag of Snapea Crisps and I thought it was tasty so I purchased a case (12 bags) from Amazon. The manufacturer must have changed the recipe or how the peas are processed. This product is no longer tasty, as a matter of fact, it tastes like cardboard. If I could return the other 11 packages I would. Calbee whatever you've done, go back to the old recipe."
4,Shouldn't be a veggie substitute,"I have two kids, a 3 year old and a 5 year old. My 3 yr old was crazy about them (she loves veggies and she loves chips so it was the perfect combination for her. She excitedly called them ""green frenchfries!""). My 5 yr old hates peas and disliked the pungent whiff you get when you first open the bag. She was not crazy about the color. It took her a couple of tries before they grew on her (seeing her sister devour them encouraged her to give them another chance).These are a bit oily even though they are baked. They have a great crunch and are not too salty (but we love salt!) I think they look cool and taste good. They can be addicting! I like dippingthem in hummus.I don't think they are a healthy substitute for vegeatables (fat content) but a good way to introduce veggies into a veggie-hater's diet. They are in our snack cabinet and make a nice addition to a lunchbox every now and then but I don't offer them everyday."
5,Great What ever,These taste good as a snack or on a salad. They carried them for a while at Wal-Mart then they were gone. I introduced them to a friend of mine and her family fell in love with them also. This is the cheapest place I have found to order them. When I get them my friend and I share them and they go FAST.
2,Leave a weird sensation,"These are a little salty, a little greasy, and a little 'powdery'. The taste is not bad, BUT, I did have the strangest sensation after eating a couple handfuls - I don't have any known allergies or 'texture issues' with food whatsoever, so it was really bizarre: they started to sort of taste prickly, like the outer part was sharp or rough, and it was unpleasant to continue eating them. The closest thing I can compare is imagine chewing on a mouthful of roasted peanut SHELLS. Very very weird. I wouldn't buy again, not worth it."
1,blah--times 2,"To each his/her own. I was suckered into buying a case (and the regular ones) on a Friday sale. I'm now trying to give them away a package at a time. They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean. I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases). Like I said--to each his/her own. I personally hate them. But if you like salt, perhaps you'll like these---grab a Brita pitcher before you open to sample."
5,Absolutely Delicious,"Calbee Snapea Crisps are an absolutely delicious snack. I am always looking for a healthy crunchy snack and my niece introduced these to me, and I love them. There are so many foods that I can't eat, and I always have a craving for something crunchy that isn't ""junk"" food. Now I have found the perfect healthy and delicious ""Munchy"" for me. I go through bags of them like crazy. Oh and my two little female Shihtzu doggies love them also. As soon as I open a bag they are right on my lap. And I know I can give them to them as Snapeas only contain healthy ingredients. Thank you Calbee for making such a healthy and delicious snack. I rate them A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+ and have recommended them to everyone. And I find that ordering them through Amazon is the best way to go!!!!!"
3,So-So.,"I love peas, but I don't love these. I found them a little bland, to be honest, and the texture is just like Cheetos. Better for me than salted peanuts though!"
5,Great Scack!,"I love these crisps! They taste good and they are hard to put down once you start eating them. What is great they are a good snack that you do not have to worry about the fat, as they are baked! I am on a special diet and they are allowed!"
4,The Food-Nut's Cheetos,"They remind me a of a fat Cheeto. Although tasting like peas, they've got the addictive saltiness people crave when they reach for a chip."
5,Healthy Snack,This product I would recommend to anyone who likes peas; it is different and delicious; the taste is great and if you can't get your children to eat peas they will definitely enjoy these.It also great to use in salads instead of croutons because they are healthier for everyone.
5,Great Flavor,"My wife and I absolutely love these crisps. I was bummed, however after my first subscribe and save purchase it will no longer be sold by Amazon. These crisps are unbelievable in texture and taste. I don't know how they are made but they are gooood!"
2,Wish I'd read the Details more closely,"It's not what I expected. I thought it would be a dried crunchy peapod. Except it's more like a Cheeto without the cheese -- maybe even greasier. If I'd read the product information a little more closely, I may have noticed, ""baked snack formed in pea-pod shape from dried peas and a little rice.""They're not so ""healthy"" either. Make sure you read the ""Nutrition Facts"": [...]I love Cheetos but I was looking for a snack with a little more dietary/nutritional value. These aren't it for me."
2,I can't agree,"I'm sorry, but these just weren't for me, they have somewhat of a stale taste. I recommend buying a single bag before buying a case if you are at all hesitant."
2,Duped!,"I blame myself for not turning the bag over and reading the ingredients, but I thought these were something else. This item was in the produce section of Walmart and since I love sugar snap peas....well you get the drift. Let me tell you that these are not baked sugar snap peas! They are greasy cheeto-like green things. The put me in mind of those fried potato sticks in the can as far as taste is concerned. These crisps should be in the potato chip aisle along with all the other greasy fattening chips, and not with the produce to make the consumer think she's getting a nutritious baked snack."
2,Not a fan :(,"WEll.. going off of the other reviews where their kids loved them etc...I do not like them and neither do my kids or grandkids so far. Sorry. I'm sure they are healthy, however.. I was disappointed thining they were freeze dried Edemenis or something like that.. not a formed cracker to taste and look like a snow pea ?! sorry, but these 11 bags are going back.. I'd be sending the full 12, however... one bag was opened and then the hubby tossed it after awhile..."
2,Lose the GMO corn oil,"Decided to try these after seeing a large display at a neighborhood food store. After viewing the farmtt.com website, I was disappointed to learn that the peas were dried and processed, and that they use GMO corn oil. Oh well, my search for a healthy potato chip substitute will continue.Calbee Snack Salad Snapea Crisps, Original Flavor, 3.3- Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)"
2,blah,"To each his/her own. I was suckered into buying a case on a Friday sale. I'm now still trying to give them away a package at a time. (You want one???) They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean. I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases). Like I said--to each his/her own. I personally hate them."
3,Good in Moderation,"Although I enjoyed the taste and texture of the Snapea Crisps, I found eating them in small quantities was important. They are somewhat greasy and are not as healthy as they may seem in regards to calories."
5,great fan,"this product was introduced to me during a CURVES low carb/low fat exercize and lose inches program.I was surpized how tasty this product is.. I have shared a bag or two with friends and they are surprized...even those who are not vegetable eaters.......the product is well liked......The serving size is 22 pieces, great for those a low carb / low fat reduced eating program...."
4,Fantastic toddler snack; wish they came in organic,"I discovered these when looking for healthy snacks without gluten, soy, or egg for our now 19 month old son. He loves them. With 8g fat, 14g, carbs, 2g fiber and 5g protein, they are a lot more balanced than a lot of toddler friendly snacks. While they have some salt, they have a lot less than potato chips and other similar choices. Peacrisps make a good snack on the go and fit in a toddler Snack Trap very well. They aren't completely mess free, he gets a bit covered in greasy crumbs sometimes, but it's not bad enough to deter us. These are a welcome change from cereals and cheese cubes for portable snacks. I like that these are also getting at least a small amount of vegetables in him, too. I would give them 5 stars if they came in organic."
4,great taste- great alternative to many other snack choices,"only thing that could make this snack better is if it was made from organic, fair-trade obtained ingredients."
1,"Not as ""Advertised""","I was pleased to see the New Britton and Brown Illustrated Flora on the Amazon site and ordered it immediately. Unfortunately, the seller shipped only Volume 3 and an inquiry to them returned a message stating that Volume 3 was all that was offered. Only one part of this great and useful reference is of no practical value. The Amazon information indicated the size of the package would be about the dimensions of all three volumes and would take some time to arrive. I was greatly disappointed."
4,"Ah, memories...","I remember I used to read this book late at night when I was about 6. It always made me want pizza. Now looking at the cover, I get a flood of memories from my childhood. (Good ones.)"
5,"desipte rumors of their demise, FFE indeed lives","Although there hasn't been much in the way of info from the band, FFE is indeed still alive and rocking. In mid 2004, the band stepped into armoury studios in BC and begun work on their follow up entitled ""below the surface"". Tracklisting:1. Submersed2. Enough to breathe3. Below the surface4. Get what you deserve5. Hideaway6. Re Surface7. Between you and I8. For all of this9. Swept away10. We can live forever hereBe on the lookout for a FEB-MAR 06' release. (track listing subject to change)"
4,Solid album from an extremely under-rated band!,"Melodic rock at its best... Not too heavy... Not too mellow. ""Drift"" is the perfect opener for the album and it sets the tone for the rest of it. ""Save Me"" and ""Brand New Day"" are the recognizable radio tunes, but the rest are just as good and have the same sing-along vibe. This album is a very strong effort, aside from ""Tomorrow"" and ""What If I Don't"". Those two songs just don't seem to fit in with the rest of the album."
5,New CD coming,"The band is currently in the recording studio working on a new CD, no they haven't split up. Just wait and see the new CD will be coming out next spring."
4,Well not as good as the others but.........,"Well it cannot match the quality of the others, but if you read the others you are a die-hard fan like me and will have to read this one as well. It starts rather well then slows down a lot and then picks up again for the usual hectic ride to the finish. Jack seems to be getting better about remembering to go to the stockyards ahead of time so he isn't chronically short in battles and always on the brink of death. Also there is usually more of a mystery going on then in this one. I won't lie to you I enjoyed it, just not as much as I had hoped. I think if you can get a copy to borrow or get it from the library you should rather then buying it."
5,excellent gift for children,the pieces are of great quality. instructions are simple to follow. and it looks absolutely amazing when finished. not to mention the price was cheap and was shipped immediately!
3,Eh,My son loves Legos and puzzles and we thought he would love this. He worked on it for several days and got about halfway before quitting. It's just very time-consuming to assemble and requires great manual dexterity. More of an adult item.
1,"cheap, don't expect your kid to enjoy this !","So, we first started out trying to get the toy out of the box. Impossible ! You have to destroy the box to get it open, even the box is so poorly constructed. Inside, the cheap carbon holding the pieces was torn in attempts to open. Then of course I saw the key words ""MADE IN CHINA"". Have not even started to play and already want to return it, but of course you can't now that the box is destroyed. Save your money! A total rip-off."
5,A fun Colorfull and hystarical experience worth the money,"What can I say? Galaxy Angel was a masterpeice of comedy Anime that proves that a Anime female cast can be treated normally, respectfully, and still be funny without over excessive use of Nude shots or excessive cussing Funimation anime's seem to have nowadays NO this Anime actually has flare and does random WTF comedy RIGHT and deserves to be part of your shelf if it isnt already"
4,Haven't used product long enough,"I have not used product long enough to say I love it, but so far I am getting good results."
5,O.S.T. 2,"This soundtrack ROCKS! It has really good songs with some dialogue. This is the second O.S.T., which is the one advertized(the one with the gray cover)."
5,Such a delight!,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. The acting is superb and I love how the plot flits from being creepy to funny to sad to creepy again etc. The quality of the DVD isn't perfect, but I think they did a good job all things considered. And the sometimes grainy screen is well worth it."
5,Informative and entertaining,"I recommend this film for anyone who is looking to better understand the life and times of Noel Coward. I have enjoyed his lyrical talents on a superficial level, listening to Sail Away. I sought out this film for the sake of curiosity about the man behind the performance and I wasn't disappointed. It appears Noel Coward's approach to self-promotion and style would eventually influence actors and society personalities alike, to this day. I am amazed at his luck and his sense of irony. One thing that is missing from the film is a query of some of the people he would later satirize. I wanted to see more of that line of thought developed. Despite this, the film was deeply informative and highly entertaining."
4,Truth revealed,Just goes to show how the wealthy&celebrities are low-life trash and raw sewage. those with lots of money are liar and garbe whores. Criminals with seperate rules due to ALL their money.
2,I hated this book!!,I had to use this book for 3 of my classes and even though the pictures were the greatest part the explaination of the anatomy was insanely complicated! The way they TRIED explaining functions of the body was hard and I found myself always getting lost. This is more of an advanced book if you already know your anatomy very well. I had to study off this book for 3 years and always hated looking inside. I would use a different book if you have to learn the anatomy and put this one to the side.
4,Make Sure to Purchase!,"I took a course that required the textbook version of this book. I heard rumors that the course was extremely hard, but that this book is a great help. I'm very glad I purchased this book. It gives great summaries and pictures of anatomy that is important to know. The textbook version of this book is very black & white/hard to read, so having this helped me tremendously! Make sure to utilize this resource and it will help your grade tremendously."
5,Great book of inspiration,"I happened to see the author at a book signing. People love not only the book, but also the author. Great book of inspiration. Better yet, it's like an antidote to all the bad news we hear everyday on TV and in the newspapers. I bought several copies, had them autographed and gave them to some female co-workers in my office. Both sent me back very appreciative emails. One had read it on the plane, traveling. Her book is about hope and overcoming the difficulties we encounter in our lives. True stories how other women got through the worst of times. It's the best. I tell friends and they tell friends."
5,Inspirational!!!,"I picked this up and began reading, and I didn't stop untill I finished it. All I wanted to do was dive into my own work and not let any thing stop me. I was so touched and inspired by these women's stories, that I cried, Laughed, and have maintained heartfelt feelings for these women. It made me want to strive to be the best I could be in my own life."
4,Works great!,"When I needed a new ""cat-back"" exhaust from normal wear and tear (small rust holes), I found this Pace Setter for less than the OEM part. The only issue I had was that it was a little short. It was made for a coupe; my car is a sedan. This information wasn't published anywhere that I could see (even on Pace Setter's site). However, it was easily fixed by taking it to the local muffler shop. I think Monroe. For a very small fee they cut it, welded on an extension, painted it with a protective heat-resistant paint, and mounted it. All in all I spent less than $150 to have a $400+ exhaust delivered to my door and mounted on my car. It looks and sounds great; not too flashy or loud. One can easily tell that it's a performance exhaust, but I don't wake my neighbors with it when I come home from work at night. It has slightly improved my car's performance as well. The Pace Setter Monza is worth every penny and then some."
2,this guy is a perv...,"at first i really liked the poems he wrote, especially the sweet romantic ones in the beginning but then he veered off into some perv in his 'bookstore blues' section and even had poems depicting women in an unfavorable way. i will say this, i enjoyed his pop references because i like that kind of stuff. he should have kept writing more romantic poems, they were his best work, lyrically i mean, before he transformed into some woman hater. so what if a girl likes shopping? in the 'bookstore' section, he writes about a girl with a playboy purse or something and how she takes out a book and kevin acts surprised. women read too! maybe he's too busy staring at their thongs to notice. he should stick to his sweet poems"
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!,"I bought this bassinett for my daughter, and 2 weeks into using it, IT COLLAPSED!!! Thankfully, my baby wasn't in it at the time. My fiancee and I tried for several hours to figure out the problem, but we couldn't. So we sent it back and promptly received another one. Aweek after we received it, it also collapsed. We had my father and my fiancee's brother look at it to see if we maybe put it together wrong. When they couldn't find the problem, I went and asked my neighbor. He said...after looking at it for over an hour...that it was a piece of junk and to just get our money back. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
3,Not well made,This bassinet is of poor quality. It is cardboard and must balance on two plastic bumps in order to be stable. It easily comes apart and does not feel secure. It also has a very thin mattress. Not a good buy.
2,Is OK,"Its ok. It served its purpose, but it is not worth the price. I would have gotten something more padded. The pad is pretty thin. I would have spent another $20 to get something with better quality more bells and whistles."
4,Great Purchase,"I was skeptical about this product after reading some of the reviews, but decided to try it for myself. When I first opened the box, it didn't look like it was going to be very sturdy. However once you put it together it is very sturdy and will hold up to any abuse your infant can give it. It's even portable, all you have to do is unsnap (which is difficult for safety reasons) it from the base and put it in the car and take it where ever you are going, your baby will always have a familar place to sleep when you are away from home. I suggest trying this item for yourself, I don't think you will be dissappointed!"
1,disappointed,This bassinet is not as sturdy as it should be considering I bought one out of the paper for $20 and it was a wicker weave and the base was stong. This one has CARDBOARD SIDES AND STAPLES HOLDING IT TOGETHER. It came bend in on the sides in delivery and generally I am very dissatissfied and will not order again.
3,Nice as bassinet...not as toybox,"I used this for my daughter as an extra place to nap. I didn't like the canopy, it looked very cheap, so I didn't use it. The storage on the bottom part of the bassinet was okay for a few diapers, that's all. As a toybox, I don't recommend it. The bottom fell out so many times we finally bought a regular toy box and put this away. I'll use the bassinet for my 2nd baby as a downstairs napping place, but we won't use it as a toy box.It is very easy to set up and take apart."
5,Simple yet powerful,I just reread this wonderful little book and was amazed at howclear and helpful it is to all of us who have lost someone thatwe love. The insight and healing that this book gives is a giftthat is rare. A wonderful book to give to anyone who has lost achild of any age.
4,Carolyn Kniffin - What a World,"Well-written lyrics and excellent arrangement make 'What a World' a must for anyone who is into Shawn Colvin or Tom Petty. I found myself singing the chorus to 'What a world' & 'Nothing else matters' even days after my initial listening. Musically, these melodic tunes range from 'Pettyish' driven rock to open ambient love songs that feature one instrument and one voice. I'm sure we will continue to hear great things from this talented songwriter."
1,Self indulgent,Where was the editor? People were carried over from Return to Oak Valley with no explanation as to who they were. Lusty? Hah! There was a loose improbable plot. This tiny ranch town seems to be filled with physically beautiful unmarried thirty somethings (presumably for future stories). Unless she can rev up the action and cut out all the uneccessary details I think I'll won't bother to buy more. I gave only one star because this is an author who once was capable of a rousing good read.
1,AWFUL AND TERRIBLE,I started reading Shirlee Busbee 25 years ago with Gypsy Lady and it was wonderful. I read it all night. I don't know where the writer of that book has gone but this is not the same Shirlee Busbee. This book is all about sex and no plot. It was so sad that I returned the book and received my money back. There is not even a good development of character traits. It was so disappointing. I hope the writer will return to her good story lines that she did years ago and redeem her good name!!
3,content of book,The book represents some researches of important issues on divergent thinking but doesn't devote sufficient attention to fundamental theoretical questions of diverent thinking as I expected.
4,Does what it says!,"Overall I think Ole Henriksen makes a good product. Very light, never irritating.Always liked his ""three little wonders"" set and recently tried this product formy aging yet rather oily, shine-prone skin. I haven't been dissapointed yet."
5,# 1 of all times!! Simply the BEST!!!,"If I have only 2 days to live, I know for sure that this is the one book I have to read before I go. The best book I have read so far. Usually books take me about 2 weeks to finish, but I couldn't put down this one. I had to run between classes so I could get to my class and start reading again. The only book I could not put down, not only to go to the bathroom.I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to see what life is all about!! :)"
3,"It works, so that's something","My husband drank this stuff, it smells and tastes super gross. But it works. Be careful if you drink out of the cap, it spills a lot when it's placed back on the bottle."
3,"Not a review of the 3rd edition, just a comment","Although Rosen's breast pathology is an excellent textbook, you need reviews pertaining to the third edition. Every practicing pathologist knows the textbook. What we need to know is how the third edition measures up to the previous editions.I have not yet seen the latest book so I cannot discuss the third edition."
3,Suger free!,"I like these because they're easy on the teeth, no sugar and, not hard as rocks like some anti-tablets are. They are a bit chalky though."
4,"Good book, condition not as good as anticipated","I loved the book, but the condition was a little worse than I had expected. There were highlighting and pen marks in it, which I did not think was adequately described. The book got to me very quickly, though, which I was pleased about."
5,Great intro to master trumpeter Tom Harrell,"This disc was my introduction to the genius of Tom Harrell and it was also one of his first solo ventures after leaving the esteemed quintet of Phil Woods. Backing him on tenor saxophone and soprano sax are two of the best on their instruments on separate tracks, Joe Lovano and Dave Liebman. The late James Williams glows on piano but it's Tom's playing and compositions that will grab you. The late recently departed Freddie Hubbard remarked that Tom Harrell is one of the few horns he listens to in an interview he gave over a year ago."
5,One of the best I have read...,"This could possibly be the best book I have read by this author. All emotions were present in this novel. I found myself disgusted at times and crying at other times. Parts of this book were heartwarming and also suspenseful. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys family drama, suspense and romance."
4,I have never heard of this author,"I saw her book at a book store and I decided to give it a try.I never read a book from this author and and I like to try newand different authors and I do have to say I really enjoyed thisbook.From reading some of the other comments and it they think that this one is not that great, I can't IMAGINE what her others are like. I can't wait to get started.I liked this book, it kept me entertained and focused throught the whole story.I give it four stars!!"
3,Not as good as her usual,"I have read most of Ms. Spindler's novels and enjoy them, but this one was not my favorite. It was interesting but not overwhelmingly so. It is too similar in it's storyline to many of her other books, but without the redeeming qualities. Most, if not all, of her books involve females falling helplessly in love with the men they hate but this main character, Skye, was not likeable enough to make it all fly. She was a real whiner! Usually Ms. Spindler creates loveable characters. I don't know what happened here."
2,A romance novel by any other name . . .,"I found this book a bit dull and very predictable. True, I read it to the end, but this was partly because I couldn't believe it would play out exactly as I predicted early on. Can't say I was surprised one bit at the ending."
2,NOT TYPICAL,"I have read other erica spindler books and found them good not excellent but good. overall ms. spindler does not develop her characters very well and it was even worse with this book. both chance and skye are not main character material- i just could not like them-- though i tried. Chance was kind of wimpy for a lead character and skye was whiny, childish,and incredibly stupid. the incestitous part was to put it mildly DISGUSTING- I honestly wanted to vomit- Ms. Spindler should have NEVER gone there."
1,Bad,"Highly improbable plots, characters are interchangeable in all her books. How many times can the characters ""press the heels of their hands into their eyes"" or ""take a deep breath through their nose"". Don't waste your money."
5,Could not put it down!,"Great story, one of her best. I am giving it 5 stars even though there were some minor editing errors... loved the characters and the suspense."
4,But wait! There's more!,"I recommend you go for the full Songs of Quantum Leap CD; it includes these tracks, plus more of Bakula (including his rendition of ""Imagine,"" which I'm sure other people feel as strongly about as I do) and some symphonic stuff, as well.For people looking for more Bakula - look for the soundtrack of the Broadway production of ""Romance, Romance."" At its largest, the cast is only 4 people, but most of the show is just Bakula and one other person. I highly, highly, highly recommend it, for those of you in love with his voice the way that I am!"
3,brain washing the scince of thoought control,This book clears it all up for you. Breaks it down in understandible language. Good read.
4,excellent books,"All of the Brambly Hedge books are wonderful. The stories are gentle and imaginative, and the illustrations are detailed and creative. I'd give all of them 5 stars except for one thing: the size of the books. On one hand their smaller size gives them a certain charm, but the first Brambly Hedge book I saw was one I took from the library in a ""standard"" picture book size, and you could just get lost in the illustrations. The smaller size of these books detracts from the loveliness of the pictures -- it's much more difficult to pick out the wonderful details, and the color is also a little less vibrant than the version I had seen, again making it hard to pick things out. What a disappointment, because the illustrations are half the charm of the books. If they had only made these books larger, they'd be perfect in every way."
5,Wonderful little books!,"These beautiful little books are as charming as the little mice that inhabit the pages. The entire series is a neccesity. The stories are sweet, but it is the intricate,detailed, watercolor paintings that will captivate you and your child."
3,Typical Rendell,I love Ruth Rendell and this is just another good story in the Wexford series.Would recommend these police procedural crime stories to anyone.
4,Quiet desperation expertly spun,"This story is an early work by Ruth Rendell, but it's a clear milestone on her road to become the queen of dark fiction. I marvel at how adept Rendell is at taking the reader into the very core of her characters' minds. No need to get into the plot of this book, but if you enjoy a meandering tale with many stops along the way to examine the thinking, emotions and motivations of the book's characters, this is a work for you. As dark as the story can be, a kind of redemption emerges at the close."
3,canon workshop,"I purchased this workshop to help my wife ( and Me )understand a little more the workings of a Canon DSLR. It had some helpful hints, but was not what I was looking for."
3,great introduction to photography,"they did not highlight this is a 2003 print. So it is 10 years behind in technology. however, it is a good introduction to photography for beginners who want to improve their skills and understanding of general photography.it amounts to a photography 101 course at an unbeatable the price.the essential points and tips have not changed much. makes agreat gift for any aspiring photographer.good for all camera brands."
3,photo idea,"A very basic review for the beginning photographer including some illustrations and advice. The software was easy to install, even on a computer operating with Vista. Menus are laid out in a relatively user friendly manner and the program is reasonably intuitive. Advice given is not product specific, so anyone with any model of camera could find value with this product."
3,"Nice, but can not adjust it","It looks fairly nice and is easy to put together, but the shelves can not be adjusted (pulled out to make a larger space) once it is put together."
1,Buyer beware,"This organizer is a piece of junk! It's all pressed wood and was a nightmare to assemble.Turns out that when you put the dowels in the side pieces, you have to hammer them in ALL THE WAY (leaving only a little stub) because the corresponding holes in the top and bottom are not as deep. It you try to put the top on without the dowels all the way in, they push out through the top or bottom of the unit and deface the unit. I now have a vertical desktop sorter that is all deformed and looks like crap. I wish I could include a picture of what happened. I was so irritated I was tempted to throw the darn thing out!"
1,Assembly required!! Sending it back,"This just arrived and it is going straight back. The description states ""easy assembly"" but that is a relative term. It requires hammer, nails and you need to glue. I do not consider this easy assembly."
3,Its okay...not as good as I hoped,"The quality of this product wasn't what I expected. Its held together by ""preglued"" pegs and even then they caused the base piece to chip away. And when I put the shelves in, they cracked pieces out of the front molding. No exactly the quality I had hoped for."
4,Carnival of Sins!,"The two volumes of Motley Crue's Carnival of Sins cds have been rereleased as a double cd set instead of two separate discs. The music itself is awesome! I attended two concerts during the Carnival of Sins tour. The cd itself captures as much of the excitment as you can on a cd. However this is censored just like the previous edition. If that bothers you, go with the import version."
4,Not your average teen book,"Stargirl is a classic teen book. The difference between this and your average teen book is the individuality it so cleaverly holds. The special characters bring you through an emotional story which shares with you the love and heartbreak, the pain and happiness, the popularity and dislike which Leo and Stargirl experience. No book I have read yet has been able to do so, and I am a great book fan. But I still find myself feeling this book was incomplete, and not leaving me wanting more. It seems mabye just that little spark was missing."
1,Boring...and hard to understand,"I thought this book wasn't very good. It was so boring to read. I could hardly understand it. Everything was just sort of mixed up! At some parts I didn't even know what was happening! It was kind of wierd and unusual. I didn't understand the book. I knew what it was about, but reading it just didn't sound like an interesting book. It was kind of scattered in all places. And it was wierd when the boy all of a sudden liked Stargirl. At first he was embarrassed by her and didn't want anything to do with her and all of a sudden he liked her. I really didn't understand the book at all. To tell the truth it wasn't a very realistic book. I'm more into books that have characters and events that happen in real life. Sorry to say, but it wasn't very interesting to me."
1,stargirl...the awful book of doom,unimpressed. let down. i saved up my money and poof it was gone for a sucky book. unable to understand content. if you need firewood i will give you this book.
1,"huh? oh sorry, i fell asleep reading it","This book was horrible and i never want to see the words Star and Girl in the same title. it was such a snoozefest it can burn in the deepest bowels of helllll for all i care. it was a waste of time and money, they should pay you to read it. i feel sorry for the tree that contributed to the making of this book. NEVER REATHIS PIECE OF KRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Read Something Else,"Stragirl is a poorly written, weak novel with an extremly thin and single-dimensional story line. I left the book feeling and knowing the same things as when I picked up the book. Personally I think that Stargirl is a waste of time, and I truly expected more from an author like Jerry Spinelli."
1,"Just Terrible, Worst book ever","This book was seriously one of the most terrible books I have ever read. It took me 3 months to get through this obnoxious and annoying story about this weird stalker named Stargirl. This book is very unrealistic, and most of the things in this book were just plain stupid. I cant believe my school made me read this tall tale about a alien girl and her pet rat. To make this book even the slightest bit better, I suggest that Mr. Spinelli should start completely over and write about a whole different subject. Like if she was like a ninja or something, that would be pretty awesome. Any thing other than that is shallow and pedantic. Congratulations ""Stargirl"" on being the worst book ever written."
5,STARGIRL,"Stargirl was an amazing book. It showed me that you don't have to be ""normal"" to have fun. She was herself and whoever couldnt or wouldnt realize that was just left behind.Stargirl showed up at a school in arizona for 10th grade after being homeschooled her whole life. She did not cave in to the fads of high school...for a while. Her boyfriend told her that she needed to be normal. The next day, she came to school like any other girl. It broke my heart.This is a fantastic book, you have to read it!!!!!!!"
4,Very Nice,"I think Stargirl was a fun book to read. It was sweet and, in my opinion, interesting. I t was a very original story, only that some parts were part of the fantasy part! but If a girl like Stargirl really existed, it would be awsome to have a friend like her!"
2,I disliked it highly,"I found Stargirl an uttery boring book. It began and I was somewhat intrigued then it just dragged on. The characters in the book were completly flat, they went from loving her to hating her in a matter of days. I recommend this book...to um...no one."
3,Stargirl ... Hmm ...,"This book was assigned reading in a college class (focusing on teen reads). The question that continually popped in my head: Does she have a mental condition? I kept waiting for the moment when Leo found out she had PDD NOS--a significant reason for the unusual behavior, but it never happened. Her behavior was so bizarre at times that I felt it lacked believability. Yes, certain parts were quite touching and very familiar, as we've all endured struggles through our teen years, but it just left me with a ""hmm... not sure what I think about it."" Maybe I'm just thinking too much."
1,the worst YA book I have ever read,"I cannot believe this book is as successful as it is. The writing is lazy, everything is told and not shown, and the characters read with an adult's sensibility. The voice is completely precocious and phony. It's a great idea for a book - and Stargirl is a great character - but there is absolutely no depth to the writing or any character besides Stargirl. I wish I could get my money back. For a good YA book, try The Perks of Being a Wallflower, or Dangerous Angels."
1,I didn't really like this book!!!!,"The book is called Stargirl. The author is Jerry Spinelli. I didnt really like this book, it wasnt very interesting. The whole plot made no sense. I didn't really like this book but some people might. Its not really a book that i would like.Stargirl is a really wierd girl. She changes completely in 1 day. Her whole love life thing was too confusing. I dont even know if she ever had a boyfriend. Because Leo acted all mean. Stargirl always had a rat winner.It kind of seemed like a girly book, and i am and eight grade dude. I didn't know if this is a very good book, especially middle school boys. I couldnt read more than i was supposed to. I think that if you read this book than you should have a back-up book ready because i thought this was one of the most boring books i have evr read"
1,stargirl review,"(...)Stargirl was a great book. It was about a girl who was really weird and moved. She went to a different school, where she was represented the weirdest person ever. She played the ukulele in the lunch room in front of all of the school kids in the High School.I thought Stargirl was a good book because it reflects the imitations in life."
1,Stargirl,"I read the book ""Stargirl"" by Jerry Spinelli; I do not recommend this book. I did not like this book; it was very odd and didn't have a good story line. I enjoy stories when I can relate to them, but in this book there was nothing to relate to.This book wasn't good because the story line was horrible, and there was nothing normal about this book. If you like odd stories then you may like this book, but other than that I do not think you will like this."
2,Don't read this and waste your time,It was stupid.....really boring (yawn)... very dramatic about highschool....star-girl was a werido...in life we would probably be friends...(yawn) Blah. Don't read it. Totally stupid and unrealistic.
5,Jerry Spinelli is a genious,"This book some may not understand, but I do. It is the best book I've ever read and i'm being serious! i think everyone should read this. I learned a big lesson from this book. Never ever to judge somebody and don't care what they think. Stargirl. The way they treated her the way she didn't care the way that somehow everyone liked her and then they hated her. The way LEo loved her. IT was all beautiful. This book teaches a good lesson to all, READ IT trust me!! :)"
3,Stargirl,Stargirl was written by jerry spinelli takes place in Arizona at a school called mica high school she comes in and eats lunch and started playing her ukulele with a pet on her shoulder called cinnamon. One kid asked Stargirl to be on hot seat. To play dumb she starts to raise her hand and started to jump precting that the seat was really hot the one ho started hot seat loves Stargirl and one day he went to stargirls house. Another day he follwed her into the desert to do yoga with cinnamon. At the ball at school every body started to do the bunny hop out to the game and everybody and some one slapped he ran the face.I liked Stargirl a lot and I hope you by the book and reed it for your self. And you can see what the paragraph mean.
3,Renee's Stargirl review,Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli is about a girl who just moved Mica high school in Arizona. At first people thought she's weird because when it was somebody's birthday she would walk up to them and start singing happy birthday. A guy in a grade higher really liked her and became her boyfriend but as time went on the more unique stuff she did the more people thought she was weird but her boyfriend Leo still likes her and he's embarrassed by her. Tells her to change so she does because she really really likes him.I liked this book because it's about a girl who deals with the same stuff as real girls do. It gives lessons about how to be yourself and not to change because you don't have to try to fit in in the crowds.Read this bookits three thumb up.
5,*good*,this is a really good book and easy to read. its both happy and sad and really enjoyable. its about being yourself and not having to fit in all the time. read it.
5,Wonderful Book!,"My friend suggest I read Jerry Spinelli's ""Stargirl"" since she really liked it. Her and I differ in books (when it comes to likes), but this one we both agree on. It is my favorite book now, and I can identify so much with Stargirl. It is a wonderful story that kept me hooked until I finished it. Jerry is a wonderful author and does a great job at discripitve writing. I strongly suggest this book for anyone from ages 13 on up. I'm trying to get my 44 year old mother to read it! Very much so worth anyone's time!"
5,I love this book!,"In a nutshell, Stargirl celebrates individuality! At a time when most of us are developing our personas, peer pressure prevents us from developing into creative individuals. At first, her classmates think she is weird then popular and then ....I'll let you start the journey. Provides great food for thought on self-esteem."
5,EVERYONE of EVERY AGE must read this book.,"I am an adult who loves to read. This book must be read to yourself. It must be read aloud. It must be read aloud to your spouse, lover, friend, mother. To your children. Your adolescents should read it to themselves. IT MUST BE READ. It is a story of the ego and where it belongs. It incorporates the becoming of self, the individual's role in the world, in love... Everything. It is all there. Subtley, beautifully, layered and simply. Thank you Jerry. Truly."
5,"Strangely, I liked it!","Although I don't normally like books set in the present time period (I'm more into medieval fantasy), this was one book that I really enjoyed. The book is set in a typical high school community, with all of the common prejudices and cruelty seen in high schools. This book differs, however, and shows the reader the value of kindness and individualism. Stargirl is a book that could change your life if you just give it that chance. I am going to buy this book when I next get the opportunity, so I can enjoy it's meaningful message over and over."
5,Stargirl Shines,"I bought stargirl as a gift for my 12 year old daughter. I read the whole thing in one day! I feel this is a great book about learning to love your self for what you are and not letting other people change you! In school it is easy to get caught up in everyone else, and this book shows that it's ok to be different, it's ok to be yourself. Even if it doesn't please anyone else! I feel it had great values! My daughter is liking it too!!!Update...... My daughter loved the book too! She hates to read!"
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!,this is my favorite book ever!! I have 2 copies of it! A hardback and a paperback! This is a wonderful book that is so realistic and u can relate top all the characters!!It is funny and teaches a lesson!! All kids should read it!! I lend it to my friends to read and they love it too!!
3,Stargirl was...alright,"This was not one of my favorite books but it was not bad. It is a pretty typical story line. And the only part I truly enjoyed Was Stargirl's relationship with the elderly man. However, I did also like the fact that she still tried to remain herself even under the pressures of high school life. This book was alright, but not one of my particular favorites. It was a very quick read. I hope my review has helped you!"
5,Lesson in human nature,"Spinelli has given the world a lesson in human nature with his book Stargirl. We watch as an eccentric young girl is first ebraced by her peers, then ostracized at the first sight of trouble. We learn how little you can rely on those whom you think are your friends. Mica High is almost a microcosm of our society. Depicting the way in which humans often act like ""sheep"", following a leader and abandoning those who are not mediocore. Read this this book and learn about yourself, your peers, and the human race in general."
5,truly a beautiful piece of work,I cried and cried at the ending of this book. It wasn't because it was sad it was because it was beautiful. The idea of a person being completely themselves reminds us of reconnecting with our real selves. Stargirl reminded me to go outside and reconnect with nature and look at the stars. Leo reminded me what is really important-not what others think about you but what you know about yourself. And all together the cast of characaters drew a beautiful picture of how we should act towards each other and how we should enjoy life to the fullest. Be yourself this book cries out! Be yourself!
5,Stargirl,"Stargirl is, in my opinion, a very well writin book. A girl named Stargirl, who has been home-schooled til now is entering a public high school. Everybody in the shool talks, acts, and dresses a like. Stargirl is nothing like the other kids. Stargirl dresses in old 1920's flapper dresses and sings happy birthday to people while playing the ukulele. The other main character is Leo who is just like everybody else.In the begining of the book no one likes Stargirl because she is so different. Leo finds her interesting. She wins over the school at football games and makes Leo fall in love with her. At a basketball game she upsets the school so much she once again becomes an outcast. (...)"
3,What About Stargirl......,"I began to read this book after my English teacher highly recommended it and I saw how fast my friends were reading it. Well it definetly didn't live up to the hype! Although the concept was different, at the beginning it was kinda cute, but then it just got so boring to the point that i didn't even want to finish reading it. But I gave it a chance and it was still boring. I honestly don't recommend this book to anyone. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. I hope Jerry Spinelli's other books aren't this boring."
3,It;s OK,"While I liked this novel it was a bit bland, its people were uninteresting bar 2 and well the end was not very good. Depite this I think for younger readers it has some good lessons about acceptence and being your own person. I would recomend it for under 14 years only."
5,Stargirl !,Someone I'd met gave me this book as we said good-bye when she left Connecticut. I've read the pages over and over and I still don't get it. I don't understand the plot. I was enchanted by stargirl and I understood her behavior yet I don't understand the others' behavior. I guess that I will have to write my second review when I finally get it and if I ever get it.
5,Stargirl,Stargirl is a realistic book that is heart warming. It shows that friendships are very important.
2,satrgirl review,"This book is ok. I would recomed this book to people that like romace. I didn't like the book becuase it is a little too romacey for me. But what every. Leo likes her but he is to sacerd to tell her, but he wants to be liked by everybody else.She trys to be popuarl. But it doesn't work becuase she chrees for other teams."
3,Star Girl Book Review,"This book is about a new girl named Star Girl. No one likes here. Everyone say she is a freak of nature or a alien from outher space. She plays the ukalele, and sings to anyone at lunch if it is there birthday. She is a cheerleader that cheers on every team. I personaly didn't like the book, it made me really bored, but yet it like it."
3,"Not the greatest, but its entertaining, tho small...","It didn't exactly make me love it, and it didn't leave me so touched i was choked up either. But i will say the ending did touch me... though the ending was a little disappointing also.(Im a romantic and i was hoping Leo and Stargirl we would marry but i was saddened that it was not so) I really don't have much to say about this book and for someone like me, a fast reader who likes thick books that will last longer, i read it in about 4 hours(not that much time really)... but oh well. a book that is a memorable something to munch on when you're waiting on another book or u need something to do. One thing i will say. If only there were more Stargirls..."
3,Susan is Stargirl,"This book is okay. I liked how Stargirl and Leo followed a person in the mall. The part about ""picking and flicking"" was really funny. I also would've liked to have found out what happened to the boy in the accident. Also, who was the guy that died? I didn't like when Leo made Cinnamon fall to the ground. Overall, this book was a little sad and a little bit funny."
4,A Lesson To Learn,"Jerry Spinelli really struck gold with this one. It really explains about the life of this man and his experience with Stargirl. I think we all need a little Stargirl. This book really teaches a lesson about life and 'what would you do' situations. I loved it so much that I have read it tons of times. If anyone wants a feel good book about human interaction, you have to buy this book. I loved It!"
4,Stargirl: a great go to the beach and chill book,"This was a pretty good book. We can all relate to the popularity issues dealt with in this book. It's a quick read and great for if you'll just be laying out on the beach for one or two days. (That's about how long it will take to finish it.) You'll definitely love the character Stargirl, probably hoping we could all be as care free about what people think as she is. I hope you read this book. You might learn to have a new outlook on popularity in school."
4,StarGirl is awesome!,"StarGirl is a really cool girl, and when you read it, you'll find out why. Basically it's a story about acceptance, and StarGirl's chance to become popular in school. All she has to do is change....but will she? Will she stay true to herself?I think this is definetly a raed for all ages, and is a good ""light read.."" if you want to put it like that. I am not a big fan of Jerry Speneli, but this book was probably his best in my opinion. Only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because it lacked minor development...but other than that, this book is a must-read!"
3,not bad,This book whasnt all that bad.It's extreamly boring but unique.It was pretty origional and had a good moral to it.All this girl dose in the book is find out who she really is and it dosent matter what you ware or what people think.I woud suggest you to read this book if your a 10 year old kid and to somone with mental issues.
3,Decent,"I thought that Stargirl was a 3 star book. The ideas that the book put forth were very realistic and I could relate them to my life. However, I didn't think that the book was very interesting. I think the plot should have had more action in it and some weird twists and turns along the way. It was a very heartwarming book but it just needed something more."
5,"Porcupine neckties, and buttercup yellow dresses","I loved this book. It's not often i rave about books. (i keep them to myself)but this book is superb. Perhaps the writing isn't grand, but the whole story is amazing.you should read lemony snicket. he kicks!jo jo..."
2,More contrived than creative,"I was looking forward to reading this book, but I felt that in a lot of ways it was very contrived. In a lot of instances, Spinelli will tell us something rather than demonstrating it, using flimsy characters and unlikely dialogue to back up his random assertions.His writing style is stilted and awkward and this book reads like someone who doesn't understand teens trying to write about them."
3,it's ok,"spinelli takes an interesting approach to promoting the subject of individuality and conformity. the book does, however, tend to get a little preachy. spinelli also attempts to add twists to the plot that make the book seem to drag a little more than was necessary. while spinelli has a good idea, the people he is trying to reach, probably are not going to be accepting of his message while his words will essentially be wasted on the students who already understand what he is saying."
2,Unusual can be a wonderful thing.,"Stargirl is a young adult book written by the author Jerry Spinelli. Stargirl is a young women, who was being homeschooled all her life, finally went to a public school. Stargirl was the whole talk of the school. Questions like, ""Who is she?"" or ""Why is she so differently weird?"" were being shouted throughout the halls. This small school, Mica High, was about to change with one girls touch. Throughout the book Stargirl was loved, envied, and mistreated. When Stargirl leaves, everyone notices how important she really was, especially a boy named Leo Borlock. Starlgirl expresses what kids would talk about if one was unusual. I recommend this book to young adults, but I do not recommened it if you are in highschool, unless you need a short book to read."
2,"Stargirl... starring... well, STARGIRL!","Alright, corny title to catch your attention. When I went to a new school, my English teacher was reading Stargirl with the class and I came in just in time. I wasn't too impressed with it, though. It was kind of unrealistic to my opinion. Stargirl, who changes her name whenever she feels that it doesn't fit her anymore, goes to school with a ukelele, a rat, and some funky outfits. Now who brings a rat to school and gets away with it? Wouldn't half of the girls be standing on their heels screaming their heads off? And Stargirl's boyfriend, who's eyes we're seeing the world of Stargirl through, is the total opposite. How did they attract? This is like a book that had only been reread once and it seemed like the author rushed through it and added a lot of unneeded fillers."
5,True Star Blows Us Away,"Jerry Spinelli, who in my words, is an excellent children's author, has blown us away with his facinating and uplifting novel. Stargirl, an optimistic girl who has a love for everything, is seen through the eyes of Leo Borlock, a student at the school where Stargirl is attending. Stargirl keeps people on her toes with her interesting style of clothing, her view of life, and playing her Ukelele on peoples birthdays in the school cafeteria. When arriving, Stargirl is the main topic of conversation. But, when joining the cheerleading squad, she becomes the most popular person in school. As cheerleader, the other cheerleaders and students of the school get mad at her for cheering for everybody; whether the home team or opposing one. Also, people begin to think of her as a bit to weird, and certainly not wanted. As the novel unravels, Leo finds himself by finding Stargirl."
5,stargirl,"in this book, stargirl, an unusual and good spirited girl is not afraid to stand out in the crowd by wearing different clothes and going up to strangers and performing happy birthday while strumming the tune on her ukulele and singing it also. leo, a kid that always hopes he will not be sang to next fall in love with her. throughout the story, leo and stargirl share their adventures. this book was really good and i would recommend it to everyone."
3,Stargirl,"Have you ever seen a girl walking around with a mouse on her shoulder at school? The kids at Mica high know about it. I read the book Stargirl by Jerry Spinellli. This was a very interesting book. The main character of the book is a boy named Leo Borlock. When one of Leo's friends come and says that there is a new girl at school. He starts hearing different things about this mystery girl. Then he finally meets her. Her name is Stargirl Caraway. Stargirl is a free spirited girl. The kind of girl that is strange, weird, odd, and someone the defiantly DO NOT want to hang out with if you want to be popular. But the doesn't stop Leo from becoming a good friend to her. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book that is funny but still serious.-Jolene Rencher"
4,Making Conformity Unpopular,"I'm not the biggest fan of Spinelli. Although he's a wonderfully artistic writer, his works usually depress me. He has changed my mind with his book, ""Stargirl"". Reading the book, I recognized the pressures for conformity not only from my high school days, but even now, during my lasT years of college. I both wanted to be and hated the character Stargirl. She's everything we SHOULD be, but never come close to becoming. I hope this book doesn't remain in the young adult circle, but spreads to the adult section as well. A winner."
2,Very very young adult,"The term ""young adult"" covers a wide range of titles. In the case of this book, the term ""young adult"" refers to pre-teen and early teen. I (who am in my twenties) was almost embarrassed to read this book. Very childish, cliche at points, and shallow. I'm surprised I even got through it. Obviously for the target audience (which I say to be 10-14 or so), it's right on the money. I'd be lying if I didn't say the book made me smile a couple times, but I couldn't wait to start another book. Young adult? Hmmm..."
5,an honest & entertaining look at nonconformity,"Another winner from the award-winning author, Jerry Spinelli! Stargirl was home-schooled up until her first day of high school, but her uniqueness goes far beyond that. At first, the other students are just curious; then they become infatuated with Stargirl's individuality. She is competely oblivious to what anyone else thinks about her, and even when they start to act like her, it really doesn't affect her. Then, the other students slowly turn on her. There is one person who stands by Stargirl, and he encourages her to ""fit in."" She does so for a while, but eventually finds she has to be true to who she is, regardless of how other people perceive her. Along the way, she teaches a boy about love and acceptance. This story is fresh, honest, and entertaining. Spinelli has a winner! I love the cover, too."
3,Stargirl,"Stargirl isn't that great of a book but it is pretty good. Stargirl is about a boy named Leo who has falln' in love with a very odd girl at his school. There is only one bad thing about that though, no one can know he likes her or else his popularity will go out the window and then he will be none as a loser for likeing a loser. There is only one person that knows about this and when the news spills Leo got a huge problem!"
5,stargirl review,"Stargirl is a great book.This girl comes to mica high. She is different and weired. Her name is stargirl.she wears 70's dresses and has a rat. She is very different and nobody likes her, but then she becomes popular. When no one likes her any more dhe tries to fit in. This book is teallu good becuse it is realilistic. Everyone wan'ts to be popular in a way but it is ok to be yourself. Thats what this book shows. It is exicting and has a bite of adventure. The book stairgirl also makes you feel like you are in her position and makes you feel sorry for those who are tarrific people but don't shine as brite as the others.(the popular people.)"
5,Awesome Book,"This book was really great. It tells of Leo falling in love with the new girl at school, who is an extremely unique person. Leo likes her so much that he will do(and he does) almost anything to get her to notice her. I couldn't put this book down."
5,I wish someone was like Stargirl at my school,"I LOVED this book! I read it then less than a day and I was so disapointed that it was over! This book sends a powerful message that I thought about all day long. In a way, I'm kind of like Stargirl, only not that radical. I was liked at first then shunned from the crowds. This has to be one of Jerry Spinelli's finest books. I hope there is a sequel!!!!!"
5,A love story with star quality!,"This is a fantastic example of a lovestory. Stargirl is that quirky girl you can't HELP but love her unique style. Leo, the person who's telling the story, tells his issues on being different than others and wanting to fit in and wants to be with Stargirl still.I also like the fact that it isn't your really typical love story. This kind of goes beyond the kissing and making out scene. The story goes deeper than that, minus those really cheesy stuff you expect when people go deeper than kissing.Jerry Spinelli, the author, although makes many humorous and clever ideas to keep you reading, but also makes a melancholy air to easily feel sympathetic in some events. I absolutely love his unique writing and the details you'll have, just enough to not annoy you and say ""Get on with it already!!!"" I especially recommend this to people, and hope you'll enjoy this story about the girl named Stargirl."
2,so-so a pre-teens reveiw,"i think this book just okay. i mean it was clever and funny, but one thing really pushed my buttons: the author could not decide if it was a fantasy or realistic fic. like, sometimes he portrayed her as a mystical, magical, majestic being from some sort of fifth dimension galaxy, but most of the time she was another unique teen struggling with high school issues like boy friends, popularity, and peer pressure."
3,The Neo-Tuscan Bolshevik Literature Quarterly,"Jerry Spinelli majestically captures the intricacies of high school romances in his latest book ""Stargirl."" He brings to life all of the excitement and intrepidation that young people go through in ""going steady."" Leo nearly has a heart attack when Stargirl discovers his presence in her driveway one night. Stargirl does have many quirks about her that will re-awaken the child in all of us, such as leaving loose change on the ground for children to find. The book does have some downers. Spinelli dabbles in the occult practices of new-age meditation and therefore may not be suitable for young impressionable minds (below 7th grade). The resolution of the story is open-ended, left to the imagination of the reader's mind. All in all, a delightful escape from blah."
2,Stargirl by Luke,"Stargirl is a good book in the beginning, but later on in the story it start to lag behind.It loses it meaning. I think Jerry Spinelli has had beter books. After about 75% of this book it gets BORING! Unless you are a lovey-dovey person, I DO NOT recommend this book!"
5,"Reading ""Stargirl"" to seventh graders.","I am a seventh grade language art teacher and my kids get read to every day. They loved ""Stargirl"". I loved it, too. I find many young adult books more enjoyable than adult fiction. Stargirl is amazing. She loves without conditions and makes you feel like there is hope for the human race. This would make a great reading group discussion book. Give it a read!"
5,not from outer space...but inner space,"Stargirl is one of those novels that will change your life. Every teacher of kids in 6th, 7-th and 8th grade ought to teach this book this year, as a way to head off the ogre of conformity that rises in those ranks. It's a story of compassion, of altruism and of eccentricity, a celebration of life. Stargirl is (in the words of george burns) happy to be anywhere. And it shows in her daily life, her lasting effects on the stodgy kids at mythical Mica High (brittle, useful but not very pretty). Read it with your kids. It may change their lives."
2,Not the greatest,"It doesn't do the best job ever of capturing your attention in the beginning, and I felt the whole Hot Seat deal was overkill. Not really one of Spinelli's greater ones. I wouldn't tell anyone to not buy it, but I wouldn't heartily recommend it. Stargirl kind of seemed to good to be true, and I like characters that are very flawed instead of perfectly perfect ones. Perfect just seems a little one-dimensional. There were lots of details in it that I enjoyed, though, especially the descriptions of the desert. If I could give half stars, I would give it 2 1/2 instead of just 2."
4,Better than talking online!,"I thought Stargirl was a very good book. I liked how Stargirl was herself and did not just try to be popular. It made me wish that we could all be like Stargirl. I thought she was very inspirational because she did not care what people thought, as long as she enjoyed herself she was fine. Everybody should read it so that we are not fake. It teaches us to be ourselves.Stargirl, the new girl at school, is different from everyone else. At first she is popular but then they begin to hate her because she cheers for the other team in sports. She was always herself no matter what anyone thought or did. This book is about one girl who shows the true meaning of life."
3,What a different girl!,"Jerry Spinellis' Stargirl is a unique book. Stargirl, the main character, is so different, but the students at Mica High are all the same. Leo Borlock is captivated by her and starts to fall in love with her. She gives new color to the school with her clothes, her kindness, and her rat, Cinnamon. She shared her school spirit by cheering for the other team and for her own. She has been nothing but kind to everyone. She is herself and nothing can change that. The students grow to love and care for her. They started to come out of their shells and started to be themselves. They are all enchanted by her, at first.Her differences made people like her, but hate her. Love was to come her way if she was willing to change. But love was the one thing that would destroy her. For her first love, would she be willing to change?I would recommend this book to anyone who is in high school, who needs to take a look at themselves."
2,Stargirl,SUMMERY:In this book the two main characters names are Leo and Stargirl. Leo is a junior in highschool and is some what popular. Stargirl is a new girl in school that is much different then the rest of the school. She shakes the school up with antics like singing happy birthday to people and playing her ukeley in lunch. During the story Leo falls in love with her and is shunned by the rest of the school when they find outREVIEW:I thought the book was pretty boring there was no adventure or excitment. I would suggest this book to a boring person that wants an even more boring book. I would never read this book by choice.
2,Stargirl,Stargirl is a good book! Sometimes it's funny which makes it a good book. At the beginning of the story there's a girl named Stargirl that went to Mica Area High School and she is way different from anyone else. She sings and plays the ukulele to people on their birthday. Her clothes are different than anyone else and takes her pet rat everywhere with her. Kevin wants to put her on Hot Seat but Leo does not. Leo ends up falling in love with Stargirl and they go out but there's too much pressure and they brake up. I recommend this book for 6th graders because they will be able to understand it more.Joshua and Austin
2,Not for me,"I have read a bunch of Jerry Spinelli's books and liked them, but this was not up to par. I am an avid reader and read everything from historical fiction to modern fiction to future fiction to fantasy to mysteries to everything. There are only three books I can remember ever starting and not liking enough to finish. And you guessed it, Stargirl was one of them. I'm sure that some people would probably like this book, but I thought it was awful. I thought the characters and the plot were lousy and in fact the only thing I liked about it was the cover because they just put the pictures and not the title. You might want to read it if you're library/bookstore just burned down and it's the only thing left, but otherwise, get something else."
2,Boring,"My LA teacher made us read this book last year and we had to find all of these LA things in the book. I guess that ruined it for me because I like to read the book, not find stupid stuff in the book. I don't really get why everyone says this book is so good because it was boring and made me want to fall asleep. -.- Zzzz..."
1,STAR GURL,"Stargirl is an O.K. novel. It was a 182 pages. IN Mica High there is a new kid,her name is Stargirl.When I first read the book i did not know what to think of her. She was different. She was eluisive. She was not like the others. This is what Stargirl is like."
2,Star Girl,"this book was about a girl that was different then everyone else, and since she was different not very many people liked her. But then a boy started to like her and he made her change, he changed her into a popular girl. The girl her thought he wanted.I think that this story went really slow. And there wasnt very much exctiement! i think they should have more energy and questions to be answered!"
2,Very Disappointed!,I was very disappointed with the book Stargirl. The way the author arranged the book was confusing:the book didnt flow... it made no sense to me. I could not relate to any of the characters. What up with the name Stargirl???
3,Stargirl,"This book is a good book for teenagers. I think this because it mainly deals with teenagers. Its a good book but its also a little weird, like how Stargirl dressed on her first day of school and wat she did at lunch that day. I wouldn`t recamend this book because i didn't really like it that much but it was an okay book it just didnt get my attention easily."
3,stargirl,I am rviewing my book Stargirl and i thought it was a boring book and i think you should avoid it.you could read this book if you want a long nap.I started falling asleep in the 1st chapter and almost till the end. And i'll give you an example of some boring parts like kevin went to a few boring games thats preety lame sitting there and cheering for a lame game. I thought he was weird because if he got a phone call he would yell into the phone. I dont get it why kevin dosnt like the name stargirl I think thats a preety cute name.
3,not bad,"This book wasn't that bad. It's extreamly boring but unique. It was pretty origional and had a good moral to it. All this girl does in the book is find out who she really is, and it dosent matter what somone wears or what people think. I would suggest that you read this book to anyone with no life."
2,Not Really What I Expected.,"Based on what people who had read it told me, I had expected Stargirl to be a story about a new girl who has trouble fitting in and finds ways too fit in. It sort of was like that. But it was told in the first person by a boy named Leo. Stargirl was an interesting character, I mean, how many girls play a ukelele in the school cafeteria or decorate their school desk with a tablecloth and flowers? Not to mention she has a pet rat that comes to school with her. It kind of turned out to be a love story, not what expected at all. I really didn't like the book, but remember, this is my opinion only!"
3,A melodramtic book,This book can be abridged to 100 pages. I really have to say I didn't like this book. At points I quite enjoyed it.. but I don't like the motives of the characters.
1,Falling Star,"This was the worst book I have ever read. Not only was there no plot or climax, it was very silly and pointless. Spinelli tried to make this book very moving and inspirational...hmm...maybe that's why it's not an American classic? I have been more inspired by paintings in museums.The main character, Stargirl, was not believable at all. She was very immature for a high schooler and reminded me of a three-year old. Everything she did was random, also. She had her own special place in the Arizona Desert, which was supposed to be meaningful in the story, but it didn't make much sense. She also tried to go do nice things for people, which is sweet, but hard to believe. A friend of mine, who disliked the book also, put it simply: ""The whole teenage-insecurities thing."" I had to read this book for school, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone that doesn't have to read it."
1,"Really, no point of reading this book if you are 10 or under!","I don't think children should read this book.It's very confusing, even I (12) couldn't understand it!"
3,you should read this book if you're one of those ppl who like wants to be popular but you just arent,i read this book and i couldnt relate to it because i have never been an outcast so for me this book was kinda another one of those books about a girl who wanted to be popular but when i finished this book i realaised its more than that this book is about ppl having to accept stargirl for who she really isand ppl have always acccepted me for who i am so this book wasnt that great for mebut it taaught a great lesson to ppl who cover up who they are to be accepted you need to learn to love you self so other ppl love you tooi hope this review shows that im not a dumb blonde and i can read
4,TIMMMMYYYY....is my name......,"stargirl is okay. there is no meaning really tho. its just about a girl who0 wants attention, and needs a boyfriend....JUSTKIDDIN! its good, and everyday stuggle to fit in, and being yourself."
2,Stargirl,"""On the contrary, she is one of us. Most decidedly. She is us more than we are us. She is, I think, who we really are. Or were."" replied Archie, the first day Stargirl started at little quiet Mica High there was nothing but intense weirdness all around her, causing students to gossip. Stargirl is queerer than what the other students are used to. Leo thinks Stargirl is weird at first, but is entranced by her. There is something about her that draws him to her and makes him feel great.Jerry Spinelli did an average job with Stargirl. The book wasn't horrible or great. It had its ups and downs. There was nothing special about Stargirl. The ending was dull. It had no meaning to it and just ended. Popularity isn't important to everyone."
1,This book was a waste of my precious time.,"This book does not even deserve the star I am forced to give it. I was forced to read this book for summer homework. It was appalling. There was no plot to it. It was just ""She's weird. The End"". And her popularity goes up and down. What really creeped me out was hearing that Stargirl STALKED people, and Leo STILL had a crush on her. Also it seems to me that she was being weird for the sake of being weird. Pioneer dresses, for example, are impractical, uncomfortable, and by the standards of many, ugly. Which is why nobody wears them anymore. But Stargirl wore them to school anyway, which seems to me like being odd for the sake of it. And she's pretending to be a nonconformist. In conclusion, this book pads out the popularity of this fake nonconformist. If you like books with no plots, I reccomend this book, and a phone book would be of similar quality. If not, I reccomend you read a more enjoyable book."
2,Stargirl from a pre-teen's point of view,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought that it had an amazing message but it was a little bit disappointing. There wasn't a climax or anything very exciting. It just flowed and didn't stop to explain anything. I think that Jerry Spinelli could have done a better job explaining the events. He has defiantly has written more exciting and lively books. I can't blame someone for falling asleep while reading. Also, I couldn't tell if the book was realistic fiction or fantasy. I personally think that it is not worth reading."
5,Star Girl Day,This is a review about a book called STAR GIRL by; Jerry Spinelli.This book is about Leo who meets this girl that does crazy things likeCheering for another team wearing funny things carrying around a rat.Leo falls in love with the girl and you'll have to read the rest of the bookTo find out more. I think you should get this book because it the best bookI read so far and it's great for kids.
2,Carrie in Mrs.Walters class,"The book Stargirl is about a girl and a boy. The boy's name is Leo. The girls name is Susan but calls herself Stargirl. When Stargirl first comes to the Mica high school in Arizona everyone thinks she is weird. She plays the ukulele and isn't afraid to stand out. At first she is welcomed to the cheerleading squad but then eventually gets kicked out. To find why she got kicked out you would have to read this book. If you want to read a book about a boy (Leo) meeting the new weird girl and a girl who's not afraid to stand out then this book is for you.I think Stargirl was interesting. There were some parts to me that were just boring and weird. There are some parts that are very enjoyable. Stargirl is different, and if you like reading a book about people standing out then this book is for you."
1,It was ok,"Yeah, im not a kid just not singed up. The book looks ok, the cover is kinda ugly so ive never read it. My friend hated it."
1,Stargirl,A book I would not recommend. Just that a character is odd and out-of-place (strange) does not make a good story. And - all else to make it a good book is missing.
1,STARGIRL IS AS OLD AS KING TUTES TOMB!!!!!!!!!,Its like a funny book yet mystery but wierd. Reason why i put funny is she makes you laugh. one other reason for mysery. one thing about weird is cheers for other team. i dint like it becouse it was predictible. my least favorite charictor is leo. hes to shy. hes not daring. that the book is not funny. it needs more humor.i would not recamend this book!!!!!!!!!!!! not now not EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A great book,"Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli is wonderful. It really makes you want to go out and be friends with the girl nobody likes because she is different. Stargirl is an excellent book that stays glued to your hands until you finish it. Even when you finish it, you just think, ""Wow, that was great! I need to read this book again!"" Sort of like your favorite movie...you can watch it a thousand times and never get bored of it!"
4,loved it,it tells about nonconformality and individuality. about how love and differences impact people in so many ways. i love this book.
3,The Teachings Of Stargirl,"The book Stargirl is a fictional novel about a girl named Stargirl, who comes to a new school and changes everything. She did very unusual things that made people judge her; she also dressed different from others, which made her stand out. By Stargirl doing crazy things it changed how people act and dress. In the end she teaches people that being different and standing out is not something bad. It is something that makes you who you are. I loved the book Stargirl; I like reading books that relate to people my age. That's why I enjoyed this book because it discussed topics that high school kids go threw."
3,StarGirl 2008,"At Mica Middle School there is a new girl named Stargirl, her parents called her Stargirl as if her name was a common name like Jennifer. She didn't know how to blend in, and sang songs like ""happy birthday"" with her Ukulele to people she didn't know. Stargirl tries to blend in by joining the cheerleading squad but cheers for both teams. Then comes Dory Dilson who had been the only person who hadn't deserted her, but tried to escape from Stargirl sometimes. She meets Leo Burlock who became her boy friend. He tried to convince her to act normal.I found the book to lack a plot that would be interesting. I would however recommend this book to 3rd and 4th grade readers as they might find it fun and interesting to read about middle school life."
4,4 stars for Stargirl,"Stargirl is a great book to read! I even enjoyed it and I'm a guy. Stargirl is not a ""girlie"" book, it's more for guys actually. So I rather you read Stargirl if you haven't. Read it! Run to the store or your local library, and buy or check it out!I really liked this book. I also read this book in less than one week for an assignment and that is a rocord for me!So get the book and don't wait! It's waiting for you on that shelf at the magic library."
3,stargirl book reveiw,"could you imagien having names like ""stargirl"" or ""mudpie"".In stargirl (by jerry spinelli)you can find a girl with the names i menchend.Im going to tell you about the charators in stargirl.stargirl is a girl who helps everybody. stargirl is hated by everybody else and does't even know.Torwarts the end of the book stargirl turnes into susan,a normal teenager.Leo is a normal teenager. Leo is shy befor meeting stargirl and finds him self.Leo is the dirator of the HOT SEAT where he fist realy met stargirl.thore are the main charitres in stargirl.Stargirl is a girl who helps everbody.Leo is shy but after meeting stargirl he opens up.I gave this book a three because it was some what hard to under stand some of the book."
5,Refreshing.,This book was great! Stargirl is that weird girl in school that you don't really understand. I can relate to Stargirl completely. She's so original in everything that she does and her personality is very unique. I enjoyed this book a lot and I was sad when I was done reading it. I just wanted to hear more stories about Stargirl.
5,Stargirl is AMAZING,"Stargirl is a 5-star plus book. It is about this boy who finds anew girl, who just came out of home-schooling, very weird. Everyone finds her weird because she is not afraid to be who she is inside. But the more he spends time with her the more he likes her. It turns out he has to pick between being cool and Stargirl...P.S. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I got one word for ya FABULOUS!,"I think this book was the best book I've ever read. Before I started reading this book I did not like to read at all, I always judged books by their cover and then disliked them. Stargirl is one of those books that you just can't put down. The girl in the book, Stargirl, is so unique and different. One of the reasons why I think I liked this book was because it has to do with teenagers, like me. I love this book!In a small town at a high school, Stargirl is the new girl. Leo, the narrator, ends up liking her, but in the beginning no one really did. Only because she acted like herself, she was goofy, had a pet rat, and brought a banjo to school. A little after the beginning everyone likes her because she is always so joyful and cheerful. She joins the cheerleading squad, but she roots for the other teams also because she is such a sport. Sounds like quite a magnificent book huh?! So I urge you to go and read the book."
2,stargirl,it is a horrible book. it doesnt grab you and make you want to keep on reading. it just talks about a girls experience. halfway through i started falling asleep and all my friends did not like it. its plot is boring and i dont understand how others like this book. its not suspensful but just plain boring.
3,Definitely for younger readers,"This is a good book, but definitely Juvenile Fiction. As an adult reading it, I looked at it like a parent -- what was wrong with her parents? Why did they allow that? Why weren't they involved? I think it would be a great book to read with your 'tween daughter. Good discussion of being different, treating people nicely, not making snap judgements. I thought Love, Stargirl was better."
2,Stargirl,Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli is a book that has two main characters. Their names are Leo and Stargirl. Stargirl was home schooled most of her life but now she is a new student at Mica High. She had her own unique style. At lunch she took out her ukulele and sang `Happy Birthday' to people. Kevin and Leo were best friends and did a show called the Hot Seat. They decided to put her on it. If you want to find out what happens read this book.I thought the book was ok. The types of books I read are thrillers. I give this book two stars.
3,Stargirl Review,"Star Girl ReviewStar Girl by Jerry Spinelli was a good story. It had a lot of exciting parts. Star Girl was about a girl that moved to a new school and most of the kids didn't like her. She didn't fit in with all of the other kids. She met a boy she really liked and she went out with him, but all of his friends got mad at him so he dumped her. One day she brought her ukulele to school and started playing it at lunch. If you thought this summary sounds interesting you should read the book.I thought Star Girl was an ok book. I would give it 2 or 3 stars out of 5. It had some exciting parts but some were boring. It describes how some people are left out and what its like to be left out from other people. I would recommend this book to people."
3,An ok book,This book is about a girl who is different than everybody else but is loved and then hated for it.I was not really interested in this book but you should give it a chance.
2,Stargirl review by ruby,"If you are looking for a thoroughly depressing book about the evils of high school social classes, look no further. You have found Stargirl, a freshman who dares to defy the normal order of her high school and goes out of her way to be nice to people. Everyone in Stargirl's high school, besides her boyfriend Leo, and her friend Dori, hates her. The story is told by Leo, who makes Stargirl sound so hopeless and pathetic that you'll want to rip the book to pieces. Although it is a fictional story, no ""higher class"" student treats their peers like the dirt they make Stargirl out to be. Incredibly dull and dreary, Stargirl is filled with boring details and similes that leave you depressed and unhappy. This is one book to leave at home."
4,YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS YET?!,"I don't usually shuffle to the kiddie section with eyes of glee when i hear the words: Spinelli or NEW BOOK! I just roll my eyes. But this AmAzEiNg! book caught me by storm. Being a displaced child myself, I could relate to everything the book had to say. Once again, jerry has managed to find me and blow me away. The characters are well crafted. (you could almost see the characters come out and pop into your living room.) The plot was just...wow...I didn't see anything of the ending coming. Having read many ""kiddie"" books, i expected a ""la-la-la-let's-skip!"" ending, but again jerry triumphs with a heart-wrenching story about love, and being a little different from the mediorcre world. (^o^~)"
3,"going,going, gone.","when i picked up this book, everyone told me it was boooring. but i started reading it, and reading it, and reading it. i read alot of great books with not so great beginnings and i thought this was one of those. but i was WRONG. it went NOWHERE.yeahyeah, be yourself, you dont know what you have til its gone, really see someone before judging, all that goody-whats the moral-what a good person stuff.there was almost no plot. then she just dissapears. its the kind of ""learn a lesson, change your view of things"" BORING kind of book....if you ask me, its not worth your time."
3,Stargirl Book Review,Stargirl is an interesting book we (...) thought it was a little confusing.Stargirl is her own person in her own world. Leo is a normal high school student who is falling in love with Stargirl. Stargirl falles in love with Leo also.Stargirl doesn't try to be perfect for other people.Leo and Stargirl are a wierd but good couple. All in all Stargirl was an ok book.
2,*Boring*,"I thought this book was very boring. The beging didn't catch me, but I kept with to see if it would inmprove. No luck!"
2,OH-My-God,"I hated this book! take my advice, do not read it, Irepeat do not, whatsoever, do not read this book. Here I'll tell you why; Its boring, seems to go on, and on and on, I was even wondering if it was ever going to get to the point, and you know what I didn't. It is a very unemotional book, very undesciptive, and strange. I've read almost all of Spinellis other books and when I came to this one, on page 50 where I was almost asleep, I decieded I just wouldn't finish it. I havn't read any of Spinellis other books scince then. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK If you're really looking for a book I would recomend Any of Caroline B. Conney's books, I've read'm all. I would also recomend the book Sirena by Donna Jo Napoli, I would recomend Screen Test and last but not least I would recomend the book Sky Rider or the book The First Horse I See. Good luck on choosing book But DO NOT MAKE THIS ONE OF THE BOOKS YOU CHOOSE!"
1,Spinelli has NO taste,"Oh my gosh, this book was awful. It was so bad I wanted to cry. I'm an avid reader and an accomplished writer, so I know what I'm talking about. It seems like Spinelli just finally ran out of ideas...and you can tell with this book. People rave that's it's inspirational and beautiful, but they only say that because it's different and they really don't know what they think of it. The truth is, it's totally out of whack. Stargirl is a very weak character, and Leo is weaker. All this book does is shows how awful and cruel people are today. Don't waste your money on this book. Read Harry Potter instead. Spinelli's books are a waste of paper."
1,Stargirl,"`Stargirl' by Jerry Spinelli, was about how you can lose your reputation in five easy seconds. Stargirl was homed-schooled for most of her life, but then she went to Mica High. When she came to Mica High, everyone thought she was crazy. They thought she belong to an asylum. Rumors spread about her, but she kept on being herself, playing the ukulele, singing `Happy Birthday', and caring about others. There were two guys named Leo and Kevin. They had a school TV show called `Hot Seat'. Kevin thought it was a great idea to have Stargirl on the show. But after awhile of everything going great, karma struck. The TV show went all wrong. Find out what happen to Stargirl.In my opinion, this book was utterly stupid. It is a waste of time. The only reason I read it was because I was forced to, for a school-wide activity. If you like to read books about a very judgmental high school, this is a book for you. I would give it a half star. Just for the vivid details the author puts in the book."
4,Stars for 'Stargirl',"In this wonderful story Spinelli has created a character you just have to love. From the moment you are introduced to ""Stargirl"" you can't help but think something is different about this kid. The students are immediately struck by the magic of such a mystifying girl.And trust me, from the moment she seranades Alan Ferko in the cafeteria to the the second she makes an extravagant entrance at the ball, you will be urgeing nonconformity. This book shows through the eyes of Leo Borlock,narrator(and love intrest), that nothing is more inspiring than the people not afraid of being themselves.I warn you that this book made me laugh out loud and by the end I was crying uncontrollably. If you want a book about ""...the magnificence and rarity of true nonconformity"" then this is it!"
4,Star girl,I love this book it's so cute.I do not like the ending as much because it's not very happy but yet your curios on what is going to happen in the next book.
5,Such an awesome read,You really get emotionally involved in it. I'm at a loss ofwords. The characters are so relatable. Speechless.That's all I can say.
5,Even adults love this book!,"I have nothing but praise for this book. ... The book makes me wish I had the courage of Stargirl. It sends such a strong message to kids now-that yeah, it hurts sometimes to be different, but in the end, you are a better person for sticking to what you believe in. I strongly encourage my students to be different and to stay true to themselves, and teenagers need encouragement in that direction. Stargirl, I feel, will give kids and adults the reinforcement that it is good to be different."
3,Charming....,"I have just finished reading the much hyped about 'Stargirl.' However, I was disappointed. There just wasn't enough interactions between characters. I would like to know what the other students say/do to her, especially her only friend after her fall from popularity, Dori Dilson. The tense moments between Stargirl and Hillari Kimble (her arch rival so to speak) are priceless! Jerry Spinelli describes emotions so well that it's atonishing and scary when you realize you had the same feelings but was never able to write it down on paper. After reading this story, you wish you had Stargirl's bravery. The fact she doesn't care or notice the fact she is odd is so fresh. That's why it's so tragic when she tries to be normal. You soon miss the old skirt-wearing, mouse-talkin, rain-dancing Stargirl!"
5,Stargirl gets FIVE STARS,"Stargirl was the first book selection for our book club (all members are adults) and we will hard pressed to ever choose a better book. This book is so completely delightful I found myself hugging it when I was finished. Extremely well written, there is more here than meets the eye. We were a bit concerned when we had to find the book in the young readers section of the bookstore, but after reading and discussing it, we were amazed at how multilayed and thoughtful it is. An easy read, but a very complex character. This is a great book for teachers to have their classes read. Not only does the message encourage us to be true to ourselves, but to let others follow that same rule, sometimes meaning being a little different than us. It is also a great tool for literary structure. I cannot tell you more than this: get this book and read it and love it!"
5,free the inner you,"this is possibably the best book i've ever read, stargirl is beautiful and inspiring, it really opens your mind and your heart, every town needs a stargirl!"
4,stargirl 3,"StargirlStar girl by, Jerry Spinelly was a book that took place in Mica. It was about a girl named Stargirl, (Susan) who goes to Mica high school plays the ukulele at lunch on you birthday. Everybody doesn't know what to think of her. Leo and she loved each other. The girl who hated her was. Stargirl Hillary Kimble was a cheerleader for the basketball team and football. Hillary Kimble hated Stargirl because she cheered for the other team.The book was good to reed. Stargirl had some hard and some easy times. I liked it but I think it could have had a better ending. I suggest you to read this book."
3,Stargirl,"StargirlStargirl by, Jerry Spinelly was a book that took place in a place called Mica. It was about a girl named Stargirl (Susan) who goes to Mica high school. When everyone meets her they don't know what to make of her she plays the ukulele during lunch time. Everybody thought she was elusive, tomorrow and also today she was a unicorn. Leo had a crush on her and she had a crush on him. The girl that absolutely hated her was a girl named Hillari Kimble. She hated her because she was a cheerleader and she cheered both for the home and away team and the fans didn't like that to much.The book Stargirl had some down things and some things that I give a thumbs up the one thing that I think I is a down side is that it took place at a place that looked like a desert the upside to this was that they had stuff about sports. If you want to find out more about this book I suggest you to read it."
3,Stargirl lover <333333!!!,"Stargirl was a book written by Jerry SpinelliThis is a good book for a young teen because it has all the things that happen to a young -teen. If you haven't read this book everything that you have and start reading it girls Cause if you don't your missing out a lot of things. So do as said and don't forget what I said. laugh out loud. Stargirl surprised me because I never thought she would make friends like she did. When she took that boy out to the desert it was amazing.Stargirl could be my hero someday, she certainly is now. I loved the character stargirl in the book, even though she was a little disoriented, she brightened my day. I love the ukulele too, I know I never played it but it sounds like fun. She was very associated wit her schoolwork too. That's how I reviewed stargirl."
3,Stargirl is my Hero <33333333,"Stargirl by Jerry SpinelliThe book Stargirl is a book that I would recommend if you like books that are about people that don't fit in. I thought that if the author had added more things to explain what was going on I would have been more interesting. All throughout the book, I thought that if he added more details, the book might have caught me more. I think that it was a good book but not a book I would purchase and read over again. Over all it was a good book that I would suggest for anyone with a great imagination and a feeling for kids that don't want to fit in.My favorite part of the book was when Stargirl (Susan) took that boy out to the desert and made him meditate.Stargirl could be my hero because she plays the ukulele. I think someday I want her to play me happy birthday. I would like her to be my friend. She would make my life interesting instead of having a very ordinary life."
4,Leo,"Leo is one of the main protaganist. His hobbys include working at school with the camras. He also enjoys his show ""hot seat"". Hot seat is a show wear they take kids and then interview then so many other kids can see if they want to be friends with them.In the book a girl named stargirl comes Mica high from being home schooled. At first everyone likes her untill the shcool football game they were un beatable! Then stargirl cheered for the other team wich made them lose the game. Now everyone hates her. But Leo likes her alot and soon they become a couple and Leo gets anoyed with the fact that she isent pouplar.Towords the end of the book Stargirl changes her herself compleatly to be poupular. She wins an award then goes to school and no one is there to congragulate her. She goes back to being stargirl and then everyone hates her agen. Then Leo hates her for not being poupular."
3,The Book,"Stargirl is a very kind girl. Probably the kindest you will ever meet. Even to People she does not know. But she is also strange. When ever she feels her name has been worn out she changes it. Her real name is Susan. She carries around her rat Cinnamon and sings happy birthday to people with her ukelele. Her boyfriend Leo also thinks she is strange but there is somthing he likes about her. She is smart, beautiful and outgoing. Leo used to be scared of standing up for her but in the end that all changes. He loves her.I think this book has a good message but i thought it was kinda of boring. This isn't my favorite book. Maybe someone else will think of it differantly. It is just not my type of book. I do think you should read it though. it wasn't all bad.By: Heather"
4,Stargirl- By Jerry Spinelli,"Stargirl is a novel written by Jerry Spinelli. It's about a girl who attends Mica High School. At first no one wnts to be around her, because she is so diffrent than everyone else. But when she makes the cheerleading squad she becomes the most popular girl in the school. The book is told by a boy called Leo, who later on meets Stargirl, and becomes very close to her. Stargirl is a great story about the ups and downs of popularity, and anyone wjo is looking for a good read would like it."
4,A Great Book to Read,"I give this book 4 stars because it was a really good book, but it needed a few things that could have made it better. Stargirl is a book about a girl who moves into a new school, but doesn't fit in with anyone. She is the friendliest person you would ever meet yet no one liked her. I liked this book because it has a lot to do with teen life and how we are always trying to fit in with the ""popular"" people. I could kinda relate to the book which made it more interesting to read. It also made me feel like I was more into the book. I didn't like the ending of the book though. I think it could have been better. In a way the ending also had a connection of teen lifes, but I didn't like it. For the most part, Stargirl was a very exciting and interesting book."
2,This book was an ok book,"I bought Stargirl withen a month or so of it coming out, I read about half of it because it didn't seem to be going anywhere, then I had to read it for school, so I read the whole book and it was ok. The only reasons I would have to say it was good is because it was well written and that it deals with the issues of feeling left out or feeling different at school.The reasons I did not like this book were because it was sort of boring and although it was well written it spent too long on one topic. I also felt that the end was not satisfactory.This book I have heard many say they love, but I don't believe it is that exceptional."
2,Here's what I think,"""Stargirl"" by Jerry Spinelli was a very typical book. If I were to rate it on a scale from one to ten, I would have to give it a five for effort. While the moral of this story is a good one, I think that it is over used. Yes, unconditional love and acceptance are important, but this moral is played out in too many plots in books today. I also felt that Stargirl's character was a bit extreme. Her character did not seem realistic to me. She is overly individualistic, and in comparison to the people in the world today, I had a hard time taking her seriously.I felt like the characters were rapidly developed and more time could have been spent developing their personalities. I don't know that I would reccomend this book to a friend for any special reason. The book is not exactly unique in any particular way. The story is cute, but I think that this author would have much better success with a story line that is not so cliche."
3,Okay if you're trying to go to sleep,"All in all, I didn't really like this book much. Most times it dragged slowly and other times it sped up and satisfied me."
1,Stargirl #1,"StargirlThe book ""Stargirl"" by Jerry Spinelli is about a girl who moves to Arizona named Susan, she changed her name to Stargirl and move to a new school. She is very unique girl and is stared at by many people. There is a TV show at the school called the Hot Seat. The makers of the show want her to go on there show because she is unusual. She helps the school kick up there sprit at football games, and other sports. If you like ""Loser"" by Jerry Spinelli, you should like this book.However, I did not like this book because it did not interest me and because I like mystery books."
1,Dakota Davis,StargirlStargirl is a great book written by Jerry Spinelli. It took place at Mica high school in Arizona. The book is about a girl named Susan Caraway who is a new student that everybody thinks is weird. Some people thought she was a fake sent by the teachers and others thought she was just simply a freak.hhhhbnghhause it taught me how to be an individual. I recommend reading this book.
1,stargirl69,"Stargirl by, Jerry Spinelli, takes place in Arizona. A girl named stargirl goes to new school. She is a very unique person that people stare at. At there is a TV show called the hot seat. Everybody wants her to go on the show because she is very unusual. She starts to fit in but she does other thing to stick out, but things start to change at the end.However, I did not like the book Stargirl because it just didn't interest me at all."
2,Okay...,I thought this book was okay. It was extremely predictable. I find it has almost the same storyline as A Walk to Remember...where the outcast falls in love with the somewhat popular boy.
1,"horrible, pointless book","I read this about a year ago. Or should i say started it. I never got past page 30 or so. Why? I couldn't stand it! The character of Stargirl was simply annoying. The book was well written, yes, but when the character is so obnoxious that its difficult to function, the quality of the writing doesn't matter. I voiced my opinion to a friend, and she said, ""Why is she annoying? Because she's herself and she doesn't care what other people think?"" No, of course was my answer. Stargirl goes beyond individuality. She is different for the sake of being different. That message is passed on to preteens and teenagers like myself. It's not individuality, it's feeling special by doing something thats not you. Which turns out as annoying and stupid.All in all, I do not recommend even touching this book."
5,"Mudpie, Pocket Mouse, Hullygully....Stargirl","Everybody at MAHS are the same, they talk the same talk and walk the same walk. What turns the school upside down is Stargirl. She makes up her own talk and walk...and more. She became popular because of this, was copied off of and became a ra-ra cheerleader. But then she goes too far with that honor...This book brings up lots of discussion and you can really relate to Stargirl, or the characters to other characters of Jerry Spinelli. What a masterpeice!~Erin"
4,"Dare to be different, but expect consequences","STARGIRL is a moving novel of peer pressure and nonconformity; dealing directly with the stress teens face when confronted with the idea of ""not fitting in."" By showing the effect one ""different"" individual has on a school population, Spinelli gives us an accurate (if slightly overdramatic) portrayal of high school and the consequences of being different. Seen through the eyes of a young man who must choose between the group and the individual, this story of school life should be an eye-opener for any who have not taken a close look at the effect of peer pressure (or any who have never felt its cruel sting). Spinelli does over play his hand a bit when portraying Stargirl as an individual who is overwhelmingly good; the deck is stacked so far in her favor that there is no balance. This does not dim the importance of Spinelli's message and STARGIRL sends an important message of tolerance to readers."
5,Life changing,"This was the best book i have ever read! it was AMAZING! and it changed my life forever. i recomend this book to everyone ALIVE! In this book, stargirl, an indavidual, and homeschooler (like me) falls in love with the boy narrating the story, and changes hos life. she dosnt care what people think. for anyone who feels lost, or found, this is a wonderful book. everyone should read it, all my friends love it. especially girls should read it! enjony"
5,Amazing& Realistic,"I have read all the other reviews-and I agree with all of them! But also, the true reason that I truly love this book, is how it captures the true esssence of High School, in only 192 pages! If I had to write a book about High School, it would probably never end! That is why I love it so much. Its not fake, or shall I say unrealistic, its very possible! What I mean by possible is that it could happen somewhere. I seriously encourage all people to read this book, and I promise you will most definitely like it!"
3,Stargirl,This book was okay. It is about a boy and his weird obsessions for porcupine ties. He goes to a school were he meets a girl that is very weird. She dresses and acts different then the girls at the school. Leo falls in love with her and she falls in love with him. She tells him every thing about her. Every thing is going fine until they are seen together at school and nobody talks to either of them. He can't take not being talked to anymore. Read the book and find out what he will do and if there relationship will last.
2,"Great beginning, but in the end... :(","When I began reading this book, I quickly got hooked into it; I became instantly identified with Stargirl, because she was different from the rest of her classmates... However, from the ""Redrock"" incident, the book's plot gets pretty twisted and sad;.... In the End, I was crying, holding the book close to my chest."
2,Not a star,"I felt like Stargirl was to forced to be enjoyable. The plot wanderd, and in the middle of the book, the focus changed. I felt that the book was about 50 pages to long, and it skewed my view of it, because by the end I was so bored with it. I recomend checking it out from the library, so you can decide for yourself. Its one of those borderline books, you either love it or you hate it."
5,Exciting read,Very cute story of a girl who lives life to the fullest. Stargirl is a story about a high school girl who is very different then most teenagers. She is always happy and giving to others. Stargirl sings happy birthday to people in the lunch room while playing her ukelele. The other students just look at her and just talk about how unique she is compared to others.Stargirl goes to a football game and is the best entertainment that has been seen at the football games in a long time. While the marching band of about a dozen members marches and plays their instruments Stargirl is in the background dancing and just having fun. The teams come back out on the field and start to warm up and Stargirl warms up with them. The ref has to chase her off the field so that they can finish the game. After her performance at that game people started to attend just waiting to see her.I would read this book again just for fun.
5,The truth about high school...,"Spinelli's Stargirl is a story that can touch every high school student's heart. Leo Borlock encounters a peer in high school that challenges his own identity, or lack thereof, because she dares to break the mold. Spinelli brings the reader through the typical emotions and situations that are life-and-death for high school students, even though as an adult, one realizes that his or her prom-date does not really alter his or her life's course. Stargirl and Leo bring the reader through genuine rush of emotions that is felt from a first love even if, socially, the love is ""forbidden."" The cruelness that can be experienced during high school is a reality that can be understood whether you were the popular one or the condemned one. The truth about high school is a very real truth indeed."
3,Readers Who Liked Crash...,"Leo,co-owner and director of the in-school show,""Hot Seat,"" is in for a grand surprise when Stargirl, a strange girl that carries around a ukulele and a pet rat, joins his school. Leo is crazy about her; but there is one problem- everyone else hates her. And when Kevin, Leo's best friend, forces him to put Stargirl on ""Hot Seat,"" it just makes things worse for both Stargirl and Leo.Join Leo as he copes with being outcast just like Stargirl.Stargirl is an amazing book about being different and making decisions. Spinelli created vivid mind pictures and brought me ito the life of Leo as he battles with himself over whether to stay with Stargirl or have what he might need most, his social life.Readers who liked Crash, also by Jerry Spinelli, will love this book.I thought the pace of this book was just right. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. And you won't be able to either."
3,dragged oooonnnn,Star Girl was a great book but the author dragged it on so long!!Only if they would cut some off it would be the best book of all times. A Girl with no fear fights through high school and a guy that has a thick shell wont come out of it. I thought it was good.
2,Andy A's Stargirl Review,"My friends really liked this book, but I didn't. The beginning was great, but as I read on and on, I lost interest in it. As Leo (one main character) finds out more about her, she changes for the worse.Leo Borlock, a high school boy, returns to school only to hear about ""her"". It turns out that ""her"" is a kid who acts differently - a surprise in Leo's school. At first, Leo observes Stargirl, while his friend Kevin wants to interview her. When he does, everyone turns into an angry mob. But Leo does not care. He might even have a crush...."
4,Read or leave,"STARGIRL, a book about a strange and independent young woman, who no one seems to like. They dont like her because she's diffrent in a way that people just don't get . Stargirl wears cloths that the kids at her school think are wierd and silly but she is just being her self. If you want to know more, read STARGIRL."
4,A Star Lesson,"In the book STARGIRL I learned a very important lesson, being different is okay. Stargirl doesn't care what other people think about her. I think more people should be like her. A teacher once told me, ""We are so involved in being part of the group or clump that we are so scared to do something that we want to do!"" After reading the book STARGIRL I gained a lot of self-confidence and hopefully if you read this book, you will too."
5,Refreshing,"The idea of this story intrigued me, so I decided to give it a try. When I first began, I though the writing was a bit basic, but once I read just a little more, I realized that the writing is genuine and that depth is beautifully expressed through simplicity. The expression of humanity in ""Stargirl"" is ""primitive"" as Archie would say. It goes back to what is truly important and shows compassion in an incredibly inspiring way. I honestly haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I started and finished it. All I can say is, I want to be just like Stargirl when I grow up!"
5,Stargirl in the Village,"Stargirl seemingly falls out of the sky to an obscure town in Arizona and flips the residents of Mica's world, upside down, and inside out.Although this book is intended for a younger audience, as an adult with a Bachelor's degree in English I enjoyed every page of this book. This book had me guessing what trick Stargirl had up her sleeves next.I have been reluctant to write a review on Amazon, but I guess you can say Stargirl inspired me to something different and creative.This stranger in the vilage story is reminiscent of Nathaniel Hawthorne's, ""The Scarlet Letter"", and Kate Chopin's ""The Awakening.""For younger readers, this book offers insights into the inner workings of high school life.Stargirl is a must read for everyone."
4,Frustrating and magical,"""Stargirl"" is a strange book, and you'll either really like it or hate it. On one end of the spectrum, Stargirl could be seen as an annoying, crazy, immature alien with no understanding of the modern world. On the other end, she is special -- not tainted by the superficial, insecure, status-oriented society we live in. The reader will want Stargirl to conform and simultaneously maintain the qualities that make her unique. Either way you look at it, this is a different book that will leave an impression."
4,good book,"Stargirl is about a tenth grade girl who goes to Mica High School in Arizona. She is a cheerleader who cheers for both teams. Even if the other team would make a basket she would start cheering because that was her personality, to be nice to other people. Her friend Leo who wants her to change into someone who is normal, is her best friend. She isn't normal because she dresses weird and acts very strange. She also changed her name to Stargirl from Susan. Leo ends up getting Stargirl to change by changing her into a normal person with normal clothes and changes her name back to Susan. I would recommend this book to anyone if they were trying to find a good book. It's a good book for anyone my age. I recommend that you read this book called Stargirl!"
4,Fun to read...this stuff really happens,"This was a fun book to read about Stargirl. She was new at the high-school and she was a bit eccentric. She grew to be popular a few months after she arrived at the school, and a few months after that, was avoided in the halls. People stopped talking to her and this other boy, who were dating. You'll have to read the book to see how all of this came about, and it's really good. It has some good lessons for life, for example, not to care about what other people think about you. It was a fun book to read, and I loved the characters."
4,Stargirl simply touching,When I read Stargirl it was everyday at the book store after I had done my homework. And i could not turn the page quicly enough. The book is realy based on this girl but it's the guy telling the story. it's about a girl who is very special she plays ulekul or something like that. She wears long flowing dresses. She usses a canvas bag with a painted flower as a school bag. She is nothing but ordinary. She is special she dares to be real to be 100% herself i won't tell anymore of the story so I don't ruin it but it's one off those books that makes you think about where you stand and how you should realy B U. I stongly sugest you read this.!!!!!!
4,Great Book!!,"I loved the book Star Girl. It had good morals and I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 days and never wanted the book to end. It is about a boy named Leo and a girl named Star Girl. Stargirl is different from everybody else, but she doesn't care, until no one talks to her anymore and Leo says no one likes her. She tries to change to be liked. You will have to read the book to find out what happened with Star Girl and Leo. I recomend this book to all ages and hope you all love it to."
2,Not all that great,"This book was yes certinaly somethjing out of the ordinary, but really more ordinary than i would have liked. It's theme has never been touchd apon, however its seen has. Usually whenm I read I look for a lovely escape from the everyday problems such as popularity, peer preasure, and gossip. Although this book is new and riviting, it was not for me."
1,So hard to understand,Didnt make any sense and was very undescpitive also very confusing. I wouldn't reccomend this book. This book was not my favorite.
5,I really liked the book stargirl,"Summary:I think you should read this book because I liked it I'm not saying you'll totally like this book but you should give it a super good chance you will loooove it. The author is Jerry Spinelli and I loooove his books their soooooo good. My opinion is that you should read the great book Stargirl!!!What I liked about the book:I liked that Stargirl was a calm and relaxed person she also took most things really safely.What I didn't like about the book:There is nothing about the wonderful book Stargirl.By Simona, 8 years old, Buffalo, NY"
4,Good book,"This book was good, but kind of corny. I loved how Stargirl was so outgoing and caring, but there are so few people actually like that, that it is almost depressing.I would still recommend it because it is a feel-good book that I enjoyed."
4,Not What I Expected,"This was a good book, but it wasn't quite what I expected. I think the biggest problem came for me in the narration; the story is narrated by one of Stargirl's fellow students who is too fearful to step out and be different like Stargirl. I don't know, I just felt that his narration took away some of the emotional impact of the story. I also felt that the ending was lacking; we never got to truly dig into Stargirl's mind. It's still a book worth reading though!"
3,Cute,"I read this book in the 7th grade for school and enjoyed it at the time, even though even then I was still too old for it. With a title like Stargirl, it can be expected that the novel is a bit cheesy, but its message is positive and its plot is still entertaining. I would recommend this to kids anywhere from 9-12 years old. It is a refreshing, inspiring story about individuality and inner strength."
1,Terrible remake.,"Okay, don't be swayed away by the fact that I like music such as Slayer and Metallica. I like the original by Berlin. Loved it, actually.The reason I don't like this version, simply put, is because her voice isn't right for it.I think that without the keyboards and with an all too powerful voice, it just doesn't work."
3,Great Love Song!,"I do not really care for the original version of ""Take My Breath Away"". But, I absolutely love this one. Jessica Simpson has a really unique vocal range & that becomes obvious in this track. The lyrics are tender & sweet & just very touching. It's so funny because I've grown into this song just as I had to grow into Simpson's ""Angels"" & ""With You"". It seems to me as if the words to Jessica's songs on her latest album are more mature & are more of who she is. I've also learned that her music from ""In This Skin"", as a whole, is more mature than the instruments/sounds from her ""Irresistible"" CD. And growth/difference coming from a follow-up CD is an amazing thing to me.I gave this CD single three stars (which indicates decant work). I'm not feeling the song ""Fly"". But its tune is good."
1,Not nearly as good as the original,"No good ... way to ""breathy"" -- in typical Jessica Simpson fashion."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"Don't even think about buying this, let alone listening to it! This is one of the worst remakes I've ever heard and I hope Berlin sues Jessica for butchering their beautiful song! All this idiot is doing is milking her 15 minutes of fame and butchering a bunch of great songs of the past. She should not be supported because she's ruining the music industry and needs to go away as soon as is humanly possible!!"
1,Stay away!,"This is atrocious and no ears should have to suffer through the horrible sounds of Jessica butchering a classic! Berlin is probably happy about the money, but crying at her awful rendition. Her vocals are horrid and the production sounds straight out of Kidz Bop! Hopefully her career dies and she leaves us all in peace!"
1,Can't Breathe Away,"I sometimes look at covers and older songs, just as a passing glance. Anyway, sometimes those older songs can be revealing then and now. Well, there sometimes can be a miss when it comes to a cover. Jessica Simpson really puts it out as a true and doubt reject. Her remake of Berlin's Take My Breath Away, is one of the worst covers I've ever heard right now in the music industry. It really sounds as bad as both Wynonna Judd's remake of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, and a mix of what is going on American Idol. The song is just not even close to as great a cover song, as other singers have mastered them. Unlike most of the other songs out right now, Jessica Simpson's Take My Breath Away is really bad."
4,fit as required,engine pulley fit and functions correctly on a scavenged BandS quantum motor to a sears self propelled mower. Easy install and now ready for warm weather.
4,Good but nevertheless could be better,"Colourful,attractive and good photo shots make this book good. However I would not say that it is excellent. This because most of the uniforms displayed did not reveal the name of their units, Therefore got only a general impression on the background of that particular soldier. If the book had disclosed the name of their units such as regiments,divisions or even army group then there is direct link to all medals or even their unit's insignia that are pinned on their uniforms. But this book is superb for delivering extra knowledge regarding Germany's WWII history.All the time thought all German soldiers wore only khaki and field grey uniforms."
4,Excellent reference,Very good pictures and text of German WW II uniforms. A must for scale modelers.
5,HER FINAL AND BEST ALBUM,"IT IS SUCH A GREAT LOSS IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, SHE WAS TRULY ONE OF A KIND. EACH SONG IS BEAUTIFULLY SUNG AND THE MUSIC IS EXCELLENT. I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM ALMOST 2 YEARS AGO AND IT IS STILL IN MY CD PLAYER. YOU CAN REALLY DRINK AND PARTY TO THIS ALBUM. IT HAS VERY MELODRAMATIC, SAD SONGS AND LOVE SONGS, AND HAPPY SONGS. THIS IS WHAT RANCHERA CDS ARE MADE OF. IF YOU NEVER OWNED AN ALBUM OF HERS THIS IS THE ONE TO GET. I BOUGHTTHIS ALBUM AS GIFTS TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND EVERYONE LOVES IT."
2,"Average Review, Missing Key Part","The book is a good study guide, and I have no major complaints. However, when trying to score your practice test, it does not help convert your raw score to the PRAXIS score scale (individual to each state). I ended up buying ""The Praxis Series Official Guide (Official Guide to the Praxis)"" by ETS in order to prepare properly; it also has practice exams, and it helps convert the scores."
5,perfect,"How to video is exactly right, 2 hr install. Works awesome! Only snag was finding a drill bit sharp enough to drill frame. Other than that, piece of cake!"
5,Chicken Dance Causes Riot at Chicken Dinner Festival,"As a member of a church's chicken dinner festival committee, I thought the patrons and workers alike (all volunteers)would enjoy hearing the Chicken Dance as they were eating/working. I didn't have a copy of this caliber yet, but even the one we had was a hit! I can hardly wait to play this single CD next year, with its alternating vocal and instrumental versions. At one time during the festivities in the dining room, our priest, music director, kids who helped clear and reset tables, and the folks who manned the serving line all danced. What fun!"
3,not authentic,I have always heard that the dance gets faster and faster as it proceeds. This is all the same tempo all the way through.
3,two-prong-not three,"apears cheap, flimsy, but it works; alas for a two prong plug, not good if your 'things' are three prong...such an engineering error, what would the extra cost have been..."
1,2 of 3 Failed to Function,"Well, I picked op three of these and put them in a couple days early. Of the three: One never advanced the clock, the second advanced and turned on the light, but then got stuck and never turned it off, and the third worked OK. It would have been nice if these worked since it is a simple design. Disappointed and still looking for a better version."
1,bought two duds,"I picked up two of these. I planned to use them to turn on/off a TV and a lamp so I wasn't worried about the two-prong outlet. Well, both of them were duds. They never advanced the time. I listened very closely and could hear a faint mechanical sound but nothing like the loud noise another reviewer described. I wouldn't have minded the noise if they worked, but they do nothing."
3,"The search of love, hope, and adventure","The Guardian of the Stone is a captivating fantasy novel. It has a humorous bunch of characters that are searching for their own quest. The book has a good story line that makes you want to read the rest of the series. This book is full of romance, good verses evil, and the hope that good will prevail. Although, this book is not my type of genre, it is still a book worth reading."
2,Very Poor Quality - I would not buy this again,I have another basket similar to this one that I purchased from someplace else and the difference in quality is like night and day. This basket is very cheaply made and I am afraid that it will not last very long. It looks fine and fits a decent amount of clothes (I use it as a dirty clothes hamper). I am currently using it but the quality definitely only warrants 1 star.
2,The photocell doesn't work well on this lantern,The lantern stays lit for several hours after sunrise and lights several hours before sunset. I would not recommend this lantern.
1,The worst product I've ever seen,This makes so much noise that we cannot sleep at night. If you are buying it for your bedroom then take my word; look for something else.We used it for one night then moved it to the basement.
5,"Ahhh, my yard is usable again!!!!","I bought my machine from the MegaCatch website and I also had the upgrade with the C02. The Mega Catch Ultra 900 series was well worth the investment. I've been running it regularly for about a week and it's taking care of our areas mosquito problem with no doubt. After 4 days I emptied the wet trap and there was about an inch thick of dead mosquitos and my wife and I are able to enjoy the back yard again. Not only is the machine working but Mike Bremner, my sales contact followed through on all of his promises by hooking us up with the Alpha even after the free offer had expired. It's not easy these days to get that type of service. Thanks again to the engineers and the service personal. A+ Dustin Mudrak, Wisconsin. Go Brewers!"
2,for the price i expected more,for the price i expected more. the sound quality is very flat. they are comfortable however. mdrj10 sounds even better and they are ten dollars cheaper i would just buy those.
3,"not BAD, but uncomfortable for me","The sound is decent on these, but they're uncomfortable on me. The wrap around part of them doesn't accommidate bigger ears (I'm a tall guy with a big head and they pinch the back of my ears). They seem to adjust well for the speaker to aim in your ear, but they don't do much for ambient noise. Not bad for a cheap pair of headphones, but I'd hoped for more.CharlesP"
2,OUCH!,"Maybe they've got good sound. I can't say. I liked the high degree of adjustability, and the fact that left and right are labelled. (Sure, it's easy enough to figure out, but annoying to have to guess.) But....wow! So very uncomfortable! I bought them Monday, and bought a replacement pair on Tuesday."
3,"fairly snug, less than ideal acoustics","These are much better than the iPod's white ear buds at staying in the ear, but they also don't fit as well, and therefore the base response is often lacking.If all you want is a set of headphones to keep the tunes pumping as you run, though, these are preferable to earbuds that keep falling out once you start to sweat."
2,Brandewyne has so lost her edge,"What has happened to Brandewyne? She used to write rich passionate romances that turned the reader on. The Crystal Rose is a sad attempt at bringing back her art. I don't understand what happened. And where are the love scenes? They kiss and fade to black...then nothing! This is nothing compared to what she used to write. And Hugo is so boring. What happened to her deep brooding heroes who were scarred and afraid to love? Hugo is so thin he waves in the wind.She seems to be attempting to write something Dickensian with the 1850s setting, but it doesn't work. Plus the plot to kill Queen Victoria is just thrown in. Why not focus on Hugo having to prove who he is? And the claim that Victoria was seriously concerned with social reform is totally bogus!All together this book was a disappointment. I miss the old Brandewyne. Some of her heroes were too abusive, but at least they had more dimensions. And the heroines had more depth. Oh, the eighties..."
2,Good premise but very weak story,"I really wanted to like this book but I was unable to make a connection with the cardboard characters. There was little to no emotional, or sexual tension between Rose and Hugo. The worst part of the book were the research dumps interspersed throughout the book. There is a fascinating paragraph about the history of Mayfair, and many others like it, but they were completely out of place, pointless and disrupted any flow of the story.I recommend that you pass on this one."
5,"James M Cain, Genius",There is no such thing as a bad Cain book. One of my favorite authors and these stories are great stuff.
5,"""Beeping Sleauty"" a hit at talent show","I purchased this book because I had heard a ""spoonerism"" of ""Cinderella"" previously, and I wanted to try telling a story in spoonerism-language for a church talent show. I selected ""Beeping Sleauty,"" and it was a hit! I could hear all the laughter as I told the fairy tale. Within the next few days following the talent show, people were telling me that they were still going around talking in ""spoonerism."" This little book is a treasure, and I plan to use it again."
2,I'm Still Searching,"I'm still searching for an uncut Don't Look In The Basement. I remember seeing this film as a child on one of those tv channels that vanished once cable arrived. Several scenes were longer, especially the gruesome finale which is the film's highest point. Honestly, I didn't even watch the second flick because I was let down by this version of DLITB. The same thing happened with Don't Answer The Phone until an uncut version finally surfaced. I just hope I'm still around when someone finally decides to release a full version of this schlock classic. I may have been young but I know when a film has been butchered. I mean, this version doesn't even qualify for a PG-13 rating."
1,Two Movies one Dud,"Well I took a chance on this double disc set featuring 1973's Don't Look in the Basement and 1979's Don't Open the Door both directed by S.F. Brownrigg.I had seen Don't look in the Basement several times before and consider it a decent if unexceptional thriller.I'd never seen Don't Open the Door before so I figured why not take a chance since I liked Basement ? Well Don't Open the Door is just a lousy movie so that makes the whole package lose 1 star right there.Terrible story,lousy acting,annoying as all hell killer/phone stalker,slow as molasses pacing,no thrills or suspense just 90 or so minutes of tedious crap.At least Basement was well thought out if also a tad slow and the acting was better even the low budget fx are better than in Door.I'd recommend trying to buy Don't look in the Basement as a solo disc and avoid Don't Open the Door unless you are a sucker for punishment."
1,worst comuter i have ever seen,"bought it at CompUSA today, try to recover the system, having the same problem as above (took me 2 hours to make the recovery disc too). got to return it. never buy a SONY computer agaian."
2,Not a serious work of architectural theory,"Allan Greenberg is one of the most sophisticated practitioners of the western classical tradition today. But this homage to America is sloppy, simplistic, and sentimental. If you are completely new to architecture, this covers much of colonial architectural history. Later periods don't get the same shrift. The final section is an unpersuasive argument for classical humanism in architecture. But the US is more complicated than that, and the politics don't mesh with form as well as they might have in 1789. So, I'd take a look at Scully, Summerson, and Krier, instead."
4,"Good Content, Too Wordy",Wordy. That's what I would call this book. The content seems good. The practice problems are managable. Covers large amount of material. A one semester college course could expect to cover about a third of it.
4,The Last good show in the series.,"One of the Best Episode of the series. It's a heat felt tear jerker that Pretty much defines the essence of this Once Great series. The reason I say once is because pretty much after this episode; the show literally goes down the drain. The quality that had made this show is replaced with sensationalism and exploitation. Going as far as to degrade woman, abuse victims, and homosexuals all for the sake of ratings. Even the actors spoke out on how bad the show had gotten, and could not waited to leave the show. Do yourself a favor, and remember this show for what it was, not for what it had became. Pick up this video, and relive the real Party Of Five, Not the Party of Five The writers and producers had sold out for the sake of ratings"
2,Hidden Christian Agenda,"Beware, this seems like a regular informational book about Louis Pasteur, and is written in a way that makes it appropriate for school kids grades 4-8. However, this book contains quotes like, ""This conclusion directly contradicted the theory of evolution. Instead, it supported the biblical account of Creation."" The back cover of the book is marked as follows, ""CHRISTIAN CHARACTER... A Most Precious Gift.""I was absolutely horrified that a seemingly neutral and factual book about so famous a scientist could contain this kind of subjective interpretation. So Buyer Beware!If this kind of material had been excluded, I could have given this book 5 stars, but had to give it 2 instead."
4,better second time around,i thoought that this cd was fairly good.Especially since this was a remake of one of the songs on their greatest hits cd. had i known this i wouldnt have ordered it.But i am glad i did order it because it was better than the original.
2,Either Dated or very annoying read,A woman is kidnapped and she does not take her son and leave when threatened with his being taken away?? She has the means and ability. Had to forward through most of this book.
3,Honor Bound is a simple timeless love story,"This hardcover release of one of Sandra Brown's classic romance written using her pesudonym Erin St. Clare may feel outdated but its theme of underlying racial tension and love is resonant. Escaped convict and ex-lawyer Lucas Greywolf is a Native Arizona Indian wrongly accused as a dissident who desperately needs to see his dying grandfather the last time. He holds the innocent ""Anglo"" Aislinn Andrews as hostage and shares a night of passion that yields a child. Lucas, after his release, discovers her secret and forces her to marry. Aislinn finds herself surrendering to the hardened cynic as she unearths the honor and passion in Lucas as a lover and father. Honor Bound is a simple love tale packed with heated tension and emotions that unfortunately lacks the finesse of maestro Kathleen Eagle in depicting inter-racial romance. It, however, stays faithful to its exploration of the shades of love to satisfy romance readers."
5,Loved it! One of her best.,"Written in 1986, readers need to remember that this book is a product of its time. So much has changed in terms of male/female attitude, racism (both ways) and modern culture, that this novel might seem odd to many younger readers ( I'm an ancient granny lol) Also remember that there were no mobile (cell) phones or internet at that time!I liked the romance and think it would be perfectly possible for a lonely woman without much of a life or a lot to look forward to, to fall for her abductor, especially after she finds out why he is on the run. And of course, like all Sandra Brown's heros, he is gorgeous!!!! Rather refreshingly, Aislin, his victim, is not depicted as being stunningly beautiful in spite of her blond hair, just a reasonably attractive woman. And she wasn't over feisty either, which made a nice change.All in all, I enjoyed this fantasy and thought the ending was pretty cool! :)"
5,Great filter that has lasted 5 years now,"Still going after 5 years. Works amazingly. My tank is only 29 gallons, so if you have a large tank, you need a bigger filter. Easy to clean and replace filters. Silent."
1,Terrible Flow,"First of all, I have two larger Rena Filstar filters, so I know what to expect and have been satisfied or I wouldn't have made this purchase. I noticed upon startup the flow is considerably less than the larger units. Upon researching, this is a less powerful unit and stated as such. After a while, I noticed the flow decreasing even further. I finally had enough and cleaned the unit again. I put the unit back on the aquarium and no it will not hold prime. It starts out with even less water flow, then quits flowing altogether. Afte wasting an evening trying to get the filter going, I gave up. I went to Amazon, and just my luck, my window to return expired the night before!! I ended up having to purchase another brand, and this unit is worthless to me. As I explained, I have 2 other Rena's, so I know how to operate them."
3,Ok,It worked and then it didn't. We used this for a few months and it broke. It was great while it worked ....
3,Incredible,I kinda suck at bball but when I wear this jersey I can shoot from anywhere! I usually miss but people just assume I must be really good and call fouls. If I airball they get flagrants. This shirt has changed my life!
3,5087 Trivia Questions & Answers,"I feel trivia books are helpful sources of information, however, some are not completely accurate. Unfortunately, there is a wrong answer to question#3475: In Peter and the Wolf, Sergei Prokofiev's popular symphonic fairy tale for children, what instrument is used to represent the cat? Answer: The oboe. This is incorrect. The cat is the clarinet. I hope I don't find to many other mistakes. If there is a list available for incorrect answers found in this book, I'd like a copy. Otherwise, I'll double check these answers before publicizing them."
2,not good for games,"The book is attractive and organized nicely. I planned to use it as a source for trivia games. I thought it would work well because of the Q and A format. However, many questions do not have simple one word answers and most are very specific. Even an expert would not know most of these answers. If you are looking to simply read interesting trivia, then it would be good. But, if you are looking for a source for games, do not buy it."
3,Emphasis on quantity over quality,"This book has so many questions that hardly any of them are interesting. This is a common problem with trivia books - they try and cram as many questions as possible, that quality is compromised. The only exceptions I've seen is the book ""Quizzing"" which was full of exceptional trivia."
3,I've found a flaw!,"Although I found this quiz book very tough going at first, once I found the answers in the back of the book I found myself getting the questions right about ninety per cent of the time! Come on give us a challenge!"
3,...doesn't draw me in,"The author clearly knows his subject matter and gives insight into the history and design of each garden. But unlike Derek Fell's photography, Mr. Hales' choices for shots, angles and lighting are too often dull and the quality is flat-looking, as if it were taken on an old C-110 throw-away camera. As a reader, this doesn't lure me into the scene to escape for just a moment."
1,Sheets leave alot to be desired,"I ordered two sets of these sheets because they were labeled ""Sateen"". They are NOT sateen. They are crisp and crunchy even after two washings and ironing. They are not soft and luxurious as described."
2,Could have been better,"I think the choice of Père Lachaise Cemetery as the subject of this documentary is interesting. However, the way the documentary was filmed needed improvement."
3,Could be better,We expected more from the LP. Also current lp version are not done for kindle in particular when referring to maps etc.... To be improved
4,Pretty Good Info,The book was very helpful for getting around Bali. Good info on climbing Mt. Rinjani which helped me out in the end. Take their restaurant recommendations with a grain of salt.
3,Good buy but not essential,"Had the lonely SE asia book but had to buy this one because Bali is not covered in enough detail in the big bible. Found it to be useful and wouldn't want to have gone without it but at the same time I didn't find it absolutely essential. There are so many hotels, restaurants, sightseeing tours, spa places that you can easliy figure out online or when you're there.Conclusion: found this book good to give me good ideas of where to go/what places are like and the rest - well, you can figure out when you're there ;)"
3,Not the best...,"I never saw a guide with so FEW pictures of the destination! Good information, but I would buy a different one."
1,Terribly Organized,"My travel companion and I agreed that Lonely Planet's quality has really declined. The important information (how to get around the country, currency information, etc.) was hard to find--often at the back. One thing I really missed was descriptions on how to travel from one city to the next. While the information was up-to-date, the guide wasn't intuitive to use."
1,This Guide Would Have Garnered A 2.5-3-star Rating But This Guide Is Worse For Digitization,"-Hard to follow, never clear which chapter you're in-Hotels and destinations impossible to find on maps-Note-taking is a pretense, not a reality digitally-Other travelers' highlights interfere with yours-Reviews are short, weak and unsubstantiated by detail."
1,Not for Kindle,Extremely poor formatting for both Kindle and Kindle for iPad. Pictures are very low resolution and maps almost unreadable. .
3,Tons of info hard to find what your looking. For,Just as the title saysInfo is all over the place but it is all there which makes it a pain. I really have to sit down and readit Ll to get the most of it
3,just get the Indonesia book,"I bought this along with the Lonely Planet Indonesia book...and well, this book didn't have much additional information than what was covered in the Indonesia book. Some sections were actually taken verbatim. Compared to other Lonely Planet books, I actually found the general Indonesia book to be quite detailed, so I think you should be fine without this supplement."
3,"Commodity Trading Advisors: Risk, Performance Analysis, and Selection...","Commodity Trading Advisors: Risk, Performance Analysis, and Selection...THE BOOK IS OKNO OTHER SPECIAL COMMENTS FOR A BOOK BUYING AT AMAZONTHANK YOU"
2,i expected much more,"After reading all the reviews, i purchased these for my daughter as she has ear tubes. They cover the ear fine, but you cant thoroughly wash hair if you use these for bathing. I am very disappointed. Poor product...."
4,She does forget it's there.,"I bought this headband because my 1 yo just had tubes placed in her ears, and we were starting swim classes.The band stays on really well and does cover her ears so her ear plugs don't fall out. But, she hates the whole process of putting in her plugs and then sliding on the band over her head.The band doesn't really keep water out itself, because it's not really made of water proof materials, so you definitely need to have ear plugs as well.I thought the plugs came with the band as other reviewers seemed to suggest, but that's not the case."
5,Great Product,This is A great product. This is the CD for you if you love jazz music this is for you! This CD is a Jazz verison of Gospel music it is a beautiful CD. I would recommend everyone who loves Jazz Music!!
2,Not what I expected,"The item description says the paper is ""heavy stock 'scrapbook' type. This is NOT true. The paper is no thicker than a typical looseleaf sheet. I can't use this paper for what I intended to use it for: to replace pages in an old photo album. I just wish the description would've matched the product.I'm sure the paper is usefull as refill sheets for the portfolio, although, I would probably prefer a thicker, better quality paper to present my photos/artwork."
3,Interesting but plodding mini-documentary,"Robert Ballard finds another wreck, and makes a rather boring documentary about it. The subject matter is certainly interesting, but it is unfortunate that the tired format of intercut historical footage and 'will they find it' video is so predictable and unimaginatively done. Not very inspiring, and makes the mistake of assuming that the modern explorers are more interesting than the history. If Ballard finds more wrecks let's hope he finds a better director for the video."
2,Sinking of the Bismarck (recovery of ship),Saw on TV and wanted copy for my Dad. Moves kind of slow with technical info. I was more interested in the original shots taken by the men on the boats surrounding the Bismarck and not so much in the recovery.
1,"As dated as can be, this is not timeless brazilian music...","The king of Muzak does it again, takes lounge music to new lows... This is Baxter trying to do Brazilian music, however the background singers going ""doo doo doo doo"" make this only so much muzak. If you're seious about some beautiful Brazilian music try Charlie Byrd's ""Brazilian Byrd"" (Columbia)."
5,A Masterful Theme,I have always loved the score from star trek voyager and i will always continue to love it is an awesome series and Jerry Goldsmith has once again proven to the master for star trek this theme is so wonderful i listen to it alot and i mean alot.
4,Different.,"I really like this track; although I don't own the CD, this track is on the DS9: Emissary soundtrack. It's not your typical Star Trek music. That is, actually, probably part of the reason that I like it. The track starts with the standard DS9 introductory theme, then breaks into a very impressive guitar solo in the middle, finally finishing by returning to the DS9 theme music. The guitar is very unexpected, which is what sets this track apart from the standard TV theme. Highly recommended - but I would suggest buying the Emissary soundtrack rather than just this single."
2,Cheap CD,"Read the fine print before you buy this one. It may look like a full-sized CD album, but the disk actually contains only two tunes, for a total of less than eight minutes of music. The first tune is basically the opening music from Deep Space Nine with a drum going on in the background that does not fit with the music's beat at all. The second tune was one that I did not recognize. If they really wanted to release a disk with only 8 minutes of music, it could have been put on a 3-inch CD."
4,Great book - couldn't put it down - very entertaining,It is a little sappy that there are so many references to God but the story is still highly readable. It is exciting and entertaining. I've read this title four times already. It is a book for any age. Brill and Segra's romance is very sweet and ties in with the story nicely. I loved Brill and the Dragators.
5,Good-Bye For Today Review,"In the book Good-Bye For Today the Roops capture the voice of a nine year old girl name Laura. Laura was grown up in the Sandwich Islands, which we now call Hawaii. She's on her way whale hunting with her family and some sailors. They ride a ship call the Monticello a kind of ship for whale hunting. On the way Laura has to write a diary of what she sees. Even though she doesn't want to her mother says she must. With the help of sailors they try to survive in the cold Arctic. Laura never seen an Eskimo and she can't wait to see one. They try to get through terrible storms and huge blocks of ice. Even though they know not everyone on the ship will survive, they stay together as a team, taking care of each other. Will they survive in the Arctic? Well to find out read Good-Bye For Today!This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn about whale hunting or about a girl and her life. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,What a great book,"My granddaughter was able to relate to this book. She would look up from reading every once in awhile and announce to her sister what she was doing at that moment. Very well written, captavating book for young minds and easy to read building reading confidence."
5,"Helpful volume, not the same as the Open Court volume","Firstly, I've found this volume immensely helpful in studying the philosophy of John Dewey. It features two parts, called ""The Structure of Experience"" and ""The Lived Experience."" Both of them feature essays by Dewey and selections from his various books. The former focuses on matters more metaphysical and epistemological in nature, and the latter deals with issues in ethics, esthetics, politics, and pedagogy.Secondly, please note that, at the time I write this review, clicking ""search inside another edition of this book"" in fact takes you to another book altogether. This one is a U. of Chicago volume, edited by John McDermott, which contains writings *by* John Dewey. The other is an Open Court volume containing essays *about* John Dewey."
5,Best Group Ever... IMHO,"From his deep dark ""The Beggar"" to ""Young Girl"" and the rest, this album has one big hit after another, It takes me back to High School, and some really great times."
5,"Just a lovely, lovely album...","... from the late Art Farmer. A superbly balanced group playing at the very top of their form, beautifully recorded,and not a duff track on the album. There really is nothing else to say. Oh, yes, the Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD gives this album its highest accolade."
5,excellent product for active babies,"We got this headband about 2 months ago and have been very happy with the experience. With the earplugs, this headband works perfectly to prevent water from getting into ears. My daughter is 6 month old now. She is a very active baby. Before we got this headband, bathing her was so challenging since she moved a lot and my husband had to use his hands to cover her ears so that water wouldn't wet her ears. Now with the headband and earplugs, we can enjoy her bathing time as much as she does :)"
5,Ear Bandit Rocks,"This is an awesome product that helped my son with tubes in his ears feel confident enough to swim all summer long. He could dive and play well. You have to wear them with ear plugs but the ear bandit helps keep them in place. If you have an active child who doesn't like to interrupt play for anything, this is the way to go!!"
5,My little man can swim again!,"My 2 year old took to the water this summer like it was his job! He put on his floaties and would hop in and swim all over the pool, it was amazing! Then we found out in mid summer he would be getting tubes put in. So we ordered this band, and the silcone plugs, from the advice of our ENT and he was back in the pool in no time! I wish I would have ordered the medium size because I know the small wont fit next year, it barely fit this year!"
2,Save your money,You should save your money. You can find a two pack from a different company for less and they are the exact same product.
3,"Great TV show, but fair picture quality.","If you remember this TV show from years gone by, then you'll love to watch this again as I did. The only drawback, and its a big one for me, is that it looks like it was transferred from a cheap VHS copy with no enhancements made. So if you can put up with fair video quality, you'll enjoy this. PS. If you think that this stuff is too old and in poor quality to start with , take a look at what they did with the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies of the 40's(they recently issued the complete set; black cover with silver writing). The picture quality is amazing for its age. If one wants to expend the effort and time, wonders can be done. Its obvious that NW Passage was done cheap & dirty. Sorry to disappoint. Ditto for Vol 2."
3,This is NOT the Movie!,Just to avoid confusion. This is not the Spencer Tracy movie. This was a TV show done back in the 1950's. As far as I know the movie isn't available on DVD...so there you go!
5,A classic series of the 1800's,This is a classic series of the old frontier. I would definitly recommend the series to all.
1,Northwest Passage - Spencer Tracy,"I have no review because you sent me the wrong Northwest Passage for the second time, and I returned it for the second time and gave up ordering it, and need a refund.thank you Michael N. Smith"
2,Not very interesting,"The Spencer Tracy movie which I rented was more interesting because it had a story line. The DVD set which my wife purchased for me consisted of 10 short stories which could have been of any Western setting. Northwest Passage was supposed to be the forerunner to the Army Rangers, but these stories were basically frontiersmen facing adversity from Indians and Frenchmen, and not very exciting in the process. Probably due to the movie making skills of Hollywood that long ago."
4,The Highlight of Peterson's Project,"I have never been a big fan of the Message translation of (commentary on) the Scriptures. As an X-er it seemed dated to me right off the press and I just didn't love what he did with some of my favorite texts. But when I saw the Peterson's attempt at the Psalms in a thrift store ($1) at the same time I was reading (and enjoying) his `Christ Plays in 10,000 places,' I decided to pick it up. Bottom line: It would have been worth more than full price. Peterson's poetic style fits the Psalms much better than the narrative of the Gospels/Acts or Paul's analytical approach. The words he chooses to render the stanzas of canonical worship tug at my soul."
3,Check the dimensions first!,I found the photo of this tupperware container to be misleading. I thought it would be much bigger than it actually was. It does do a nice job of storing unfrosted cupcakes and cookies but the lid is difficult to close properly.
4,Y Descent of Man,"This is a fascinating look at male genetics and biology and makes for enlightening reading. I think it may be of more interest to males due to the very gender specific content, but saying that women may well find it an interesting read for an insight into the male condition. I agree with an earlier review where it says this is a touch long winded and I have to say that after the superb 'Language of the Genes' by the same author, I've felt disappointed by every thing I've read of his since. This has plenty to say, but it could have been said so much better (hence the four stars). Overall, a good read about those of us with that 'y' chromosome and worth sticking with for some interesting facts.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,"Starts well, but descends into titillation","The first three chapters of this book stay more or less on the theme implied by the title, focusing on genetics, reproduction and the effects of hormones. The author's concluding chapter, which states that ""We are in the midst of an ascent of women matched by an equivalent descent of men,"" is thought-provoking if not completely convincing. Unfortunately, Jones devotes most of his other chapters to more titillating subjects such as sexual behavior, erectile dysfunction, circumcision, sperm counts, paternity tests, and surrogate parenthood. The author's overall theme that men are the second sex would have been more persuasive if he had stayed with the science, which he knows how to explain."
2,Some interesting ideas but not a pleasure to read,"Buy this book used or you'll regret it.This is poorly written book that requires a lot of work to read and the payoff is slim. There are some interesting facts and ideas but I'm not sure they were worth the effort. A number of ideas are presented in ""male vs female"" competition of the sexes in different animals but those notions are better laid out elsewhere on the internet today."
2,''strapless'',BEWARE!!!when purchasing this item it's a bit small could be ideal for young children also it does not have a shoulder strap as show in the picture or a place to even attach one for that matter.
1,Don't Wast Your Time!!!,"Set was out of box failure. Norcent US Support is terrible. They did not address my concern in a timely manner. In short, they tied up my money for 15 days, and strung me along wasting my time. - Do yourself a favor and shop a major brand with established support!"
2,The definition of data mining is bizarre,"Contrary to the previous review, the marketing stuff begins from chapter 7. One particular note: I found author's definition of data mining (p.18) strange at least: ""Data mining tools is the category of software that includes any and all tools that, when provided to end users, give them the ability to do ad-hoc and/or user-defined analyses of information in order to solve specific business problems."" Defining the topic that way, the author manages to describe MS Query as data mining tool. Some general architectural issues are valid and interesting, though."
3,"Good, But Not Great","As other reviewer's have pointed out, this CD contains several excellent themes from films of the 40's and 50's. One caution, these selections are taken directly from the films themselves and have some sound effects and rather clipped transitions or endings. Many contain the Main Theme and End Titles sort of ""smashed"" together. On the plus side, there are many themes that you will not be able to obtain elsewhere. Just be aware that the sound quality is mono and varies substantially from one selection to the next."
5,"The Real Deal, Dollface","The streets were as empty as a drunk's pockets at the end of a long night, and all I had to go on was a first name and a handkerchief that smelled like fast cars and trust funds....Anyone who loves film noir should get a kick out of this disc. It's 31 grabs of the scores from 31 great noir films, no muss or fuss. The sort of mood recording I used to put together as a kid using a cassette recorder and the TV. Perfect for when you're driving alone at night or drowning bad memories in cheap bourbon."
4,Vegas Plaid was better,The Vegas Show was so much better when Mr. Ewing was there. But since the show was removed from Vegas this is a good distraction.
3,Okay if you like corny,"I can understand how seeing Forever Plaid in a live theatre setting would be much better than watching it at home on tv. In a theatre with other people, little things become funnier when everyone else is laughing, but at home--not so much. The show was very clean, which I appreciated. Most of the old songs were not my favorites--but they're very probably someone else's. The guys were sweet and charming. I expected more of a plot but it was actually a concert. It was okay to watch once but I don't feel the urge to watch it again."
1,Not so good,I had the product for 2 weeks and all the ball bearings came out. Quality is very poor and would not reccomend this product.
3,It's Adequate,"I bought this timer to control a little crock pot I want to cook soup with for 6 hours before I return from work. It works OK. Be aware, though, that the resolution is only 1hour. You can set each hour of the day to be either ON or OFF. My main gripe with this item, though, is the override wheel. It's a plain red wheel that toggles on and off 4 times. In other words: turn the wheel 1/4 turn, and it turns off - turn the wheel another 1/4 turn, and it turns on - turn the wheel another 1/4 turn, and it turns off again - turn the wheel another 1/4 turn, and it turns on again. There's no light to indicate whether or not the override switch is set to ON or OFF. So, if you spin that wheel an unknown number of times and then plug in your crock pot which also does not have an ON light, you have no idea whether or not your timer is turned on. If it's OFF, you're going to come home to cold, uncooked soup. I had to bring over a little desk lamp to ensure the override switch was set to ON."
2,disappointed,"I bought the timer for a lamp and a hotplate for shabbat. It worked well for the first 5 or 6 times, then it completely stopped working."
1,Poor Quality - Stay away,"I bought this unit and the timer stopped keeping proper time within a month of using it.I also bought a Timex Digital timer and it was immediately defective, I sent it back to the manufacturer and the warranty replacement they sent me was DEFECTIVE TOO!Whoever makes these TIMEX timers must have zero quality control. Stay away and find something else!"
1,Better timers are available,Best thing about the Timex timer is that it will accept a grounded (3-prong) plug. But it is not very precise unless +/- half an hour is okay for your needs. It is also a bit difficult to move the time setting tabs to their on or off positions (my wife broke a fingernail doing this). Not recommended.
3,That's not good enough.,"The timer works I'll give it that. The manual override dial doesn't push the schedule ahead like some other timers. It handles a heater just fine. The on/off times aren't precise, but close enough. The reason for three stars is because the tabs are too much of a pain to move."
3,Not that strong...,"I was actually really disappointed with this book. With as many good reviews as it got, I was very excited at the prospect of buying it. I (thankfully) went to the store to review it before purchasing. Yes, there are a lot of logos to glean ideas from, but most of the logos presented are weak and really could have been simplified or refined more (another reviewer said this book has quantity over quality which I wholeheartedly agree with). Two books of much stronger logos (which I bought instead of this) are Logos: From North to South America by Pedro Guitton, and LogoLounge: 2,000 International Identities by Leading Designers by Bill Gardner and Catharine Fishel."
4,"quantity, not quality","I recently ordered this book for our advertising agency. At a previous job, I had often used the first Big Book of Logos (white background on cover) as a reference for inspiration and looked forward to having a similar resource at this job. I ordered version 4 since I had so thoroughly used version 1 and wanted to see some new logos. Indeed, it turned out to be a big, fat book of logos, very similar to version 1. However, I was disappointed by the lackluster quality of some of the work included. This may be due in part to my eye as a designer improving since I was first dazzled by version 1 freshly out of college, but I think the more likely explanation is that the overall logo quality of version 4 is inferior to version 1. That being said, it's still a great resource to look through to get the juices flowing and to find ideas for different treatments and I will likely continue to reference it often."
4,Love the Song Ticklish Mambo,"My kids get hysterical when I play this song. Great album, lotsa cha cha cha. Turned onto this great by Mark Mothersbaugh/Wes Anderson movie."
5,"IT IS POP-TECHNO, both emotional and intellectual at the same time","I first heard this group when I was in high school in 1977 and it has been a favorite since then. However, because it is a french group I could not get any albums after I came to USA (sort of like trying to get music from the group ""Air"" a few years ago in USA). This compillation album has at least 3 great songs ('Magic Fly', 'Air Force' and either 'Just Blue' or 'Fasten Seat Belt') plus other good songs."
2,Check the ISBN #,"I bought this book for mainly guitar tabs and secondly for the CD. I has neither. I checked the ISBN number and they match for this book. (978-0-634-01948-7) There are other similar books including one with just guitar tablature that includes a CD. I figured this book had more to it so I bought it instead. Although it's difficult to tell exactly what parts of some songs are because they flow together, the songs in the book are in the wrong order and this book seems incomplete at best. The only thing useful were the guitar chords. If you are buying this book for guitar it is not the one you wan't. I recomend you do some research before you buy any book and try to check to make sure the ISBN numbers match the one you do want. I noticed they are not always listed.AFTER POSTING THIS I NOTICED THE REVIEW IS POSTED FOR MORE THAN ONE BOOK. BE CAREFUL OF THE REVIEWS!"
3,Reviews are not correct,"Beware that for some reason, music book reviews seldom pertain to the book being reviewed. There are more than a half dozen different music books for The Dark Side of the Moon: The guitar tab book, the full score book, the bass tab book, the playalong CD/book, the piano/vocal/guitar book, and so on.But for some reason, all the reviews get mixed in together. It is not like these are different editions of Jane Eyre -- where the text is the same so the reviews pertain. These are completely different documents, loosely or tightly based on the Pink Floyd album. It would be like considering every book interpreting Moby Dick to be the same book. They are not, and neither are all these books related to the Dark Side of the Moon.So caveat emptor, ignore most of the reviews, and buy whichever one you need."
2,Thanks for telling me it's BASS tablature,"I purchased this book thinking it was for guitar, only the whole book is bass tab. You would think it would say so SOMEWHERE on the page..."
2,Not the same quality as it used to be,"I have other Melissa and Doug puzzles, and expected this one to be just as good. Mistake. The older ones had pictures painted on the wood board, this one has a paper picture glued on. The safety of your baby eating that paper and glue is unclear...On top of this, the board is not solid wood, but looks like a few thin boards pressed together (sorry, don't know what it's called!) - the edges are very sharp, I tried to file the rough sides down and cut my hand!Of course, no way my son is playing with this puzzle, so all its cuteness and pretty sound education value - along with my money, are going to waste. Think twice before buying."
4,Great First Puzzle,"The puzzle is super cute and colorful. The large knobs make it easy for a one year old to handle the pieces. The only downside is that the wood is pretty soft so if your little one is into banging things around, the puzzle can look worn pretty quickly."
2,not durable,"While my daughter likes playing with this puzzle, the puzzle is not durable. She, like many teething toddlers, chews on things. The pieces of this puzzle are made out of particle board and just dissolves when chewed or slobbered on..."
4,Great quality,Great quality & durability. My daughter has a few she got for her 1st birthday & still plays with them now at 18 months.This is my go to present for any child turning one!
3,Great fun!,"My son likes doing puzzles, and this is great for him. The large knobs fit his hands easily, and he has fun removing and replacing the pieces over and over again."
3,A fun puzzle for younger kids,"Our 17 month old really likes this puzzle. I like that the pictures of the pieces appear in the spaces left when the pieces come out - a nice touch. The knobs are larger than most puzzles, making it easier to play with.One of the knobs did break off, but was easy repaired. She's a bit of a brut so it's understandable."
4,Great toy,"I bought this for my niece's 1st birhday and she likes it- especially the big knobs which allow her to fit the piece in properly- she had other puzzles but didn't have the dexterity to get them into place, with this toy she can fit them into the spot much easier."
3,Can be dangerous,This is a pretty good puzzle. But it can be dangerous because it is wooden. Many kids like to put things in their mouth and throw. I would recommended getting a plastic puzzle.
3,Great,"These were great until my teether ate the pictures off as well as some of the particle board. Basically, play with supervision!"
1,Not Durable,"Disappointed with the quality of this puzzle. Our had paper on top, not paint, which quickly started deteriorating. The board itself and the pieces are layered fiber particle board. I don't know how the folks at Melissa and Doug think something like this will last, especially at this age when kids chew on everything. Also, the toxicity of the inks on the paper and the glues in the particle board concern me. Paint on toys has to meet certin requirements, but I don't know if the inks on paper do. My son received this for his first birthday, and unfortunately he only got to play with it once before we had to put it up. I ordered some wooden puzzles by Hape with non toxic paint that I am hoping of are better quality."
2,keeps resetting,"I bought two of these. About every 2-4 days one of them keeps resetting to F or off and I move it back to countdown and it works for a while again. The second one usually remembers what to do for about a week. Not sure why they keep resetting themselves, its not rain, but it really makes them useless. I have one on a bug zapper and one on an exterior light. I tied swapping the locations thinking it was a ground fault or something? I got the same results on the same unit. I would not recommend these, the mechanical ones seem much more robust."
3,Sturdy and clean.,I wasn't a big fan of the price of this product but I have been on the hunt for a satin/brushed nickel look since that is what my faucet and the rest of my bathroom has.Overall I'm quite satisfied. It has created a nice storage area for me and fills the space with clean lines rather than some cheapy looking bracket.
3,good,"if you want this towel shelf for 4 towel in the top it's good and nice, if you want for more than 6 in the top don't lose your money because is nice but delicate"
2,Other books on memory and thinking are better,"I've read a few books on memory and this one is below average. There are pages that repeat themselves (for example, text on one page is repeated in a chart on a facing page), memory techniques that are not explained fully (mnemonics is not well presented) and no depth to offer the reader any new insight into improving one's memory.Kenneth Higbee (Your Memory) or Robert Goldman (Brain Fitness) offer two stellar alternatives to Green's somewhat boring and plodding book."
5,Excelent Book and Service,"Funny thing about this book. It is a great book to read but when I set it down and turn around to go do something else I wind up forgetting where I put the book when I decide to go back to read it. But it does have a lot of good ideas on how to improve your memory.Thanks so much for your your services.Love alway's, Nancy."
2,Ok book. Not highly recommended but somewhat interesting....,"I was excited to read this book because I knew it dealt with Munchausen by Proxy Syndrome (MBPS) and thought it would be fascinating. It was indeed somewhat interesting and certainly well-written, but I was hoping for more insight into the ways in which the mother and subsequently her daughter handled this disease and the ways in which it impacted on their own lives. I guess my only disappointment was that I was looking for more information and insight into the condition/disease itself and the ways in which the characters harmed their children and how they each of them dealt with it on an emotional level, than just how it impacted the family on a larger scale.While I don't highly recommend this book, I thought it was certainly interesting and a good overall book. It could make an interesting book club selection too."
4,A much needed up to date text book on Risk,"There has for some considerable time been a need for a compehesive and up to date text book covering the whole range of issues and techniques associated with risk and reliability in the process industries and Mark Tweeddale's book meets this need admirably. Its logical and systematic approach will appeal to the student who intends a career in the process industries and to current professionals whether in Management, Safety,Engineering or Insurance functions associated with these Industries."
5,Just as advertised,I use this mask when I'm doing hardcore sanding and painting...it's great. Unlike the crappy paper masks this one actually allows you to BREATHE easy while working. The filters claim to stop everything...I'm still alive after staining a ton of stuff and sanding plywood furniture. Good product.
4,Works well,It does a great job keeping acrylic dust out of my sinus'. It's a little big with safely goggles but seal is tight.
5,Equipment for an affordable price,I was amazed to be able to aquire this mask for so little.I've wanted one for years since my first one got too old and finding filters was a trip across the state.Thank You for helping me restore my eqipment items.
3,Average Mask,"This is a good short term mask, and does the job it is designed to do. The straps could be a little more robust, but are fine for limited use."
1,Blue rubber mateial deteriorates quickly,"This mask truly is horrible in my opinion. We purchased two of them during different times of the year, and both started deteriorating. Instead of being cleanable, these start to chunk off like a really lousy pencil eraser. It's a gummy type of rubber not meant to last. We've only used them for dust, no fumes/solvents. Since the blue rubber doesn't stay intact, seals become nonexistent around the face where it counts.The other huge CON about this mask is that it causes pain when wearing glasses. Something to do with the position it forces the pads on the glasses upward. Most people wear these masks with hearing protection, and that further causes pain where the nose pads are. They could've streamlined this design much more."
4,Just what i needed it,"Once you install the filters and adjust the respirator to your face, you are ready to go although i think it would have been better if the filters had threads on them to install them"
2,I like the 3M mask much better,"Don't really use this mask anymore. The fit is not right, one of the valves stuck open and was letting air in, Just not my mask. Going back to 3M which works fine."
4,Great book,it is effective and good written.... ideally should be read before starting with a manager / leader role... strongly suggested even to whom hasn't got a specific management background
3,Crole Jackson's Color Me Beautiful color analysis book:,"I have read this book over several times over the past 14 years, and have tried to categorize my own coloring into one of these 4 seasonal color palettes, however I have to be fair and say that while I enjoy reading it, and the book itself is fun enough to read again and again, I have to say that I am not just one type of coloring: I think that it leaves something to be desired in assuming there are only one of four ways to be categorized. I have eyes of a ""Spring"", hair of a ""Spring + Summer"" both, and skin that appears to be neutral light/fair- not ""blue"" or ""yellow"".I feel it needs some tweaking,but is a good read."
4,Colors are forever,"Fashion styles come and go but we all have to wear colors. Just which ones? I bought this book when it was first published and I consider the color advice as relevant today as it was then. It may be difficult for some to pinpoint their season and this is where a professional consultation comes in. I don't know if anyone is still doing this. I had mine done when the book first came out and you really need to sit in front of a mirror and see yourself draped not just with the ""right"" colors, but the ""wrong"" ones to see the difference.I hate shopping but I can quickly scan racks and racks of clothing for my colors to pinpoint what's right for me. Until this year, with loads of bright colors that I could finally wear, shopping the past few years was dismal. As a Spring, I can't wear black or gray which seemed to be everywhere. At least I saved a fortune! If only designers would do their collections in a few colors of every season so we'd all look good all the time."
4,Who hasn't been influenced by this?,"My mother bought this book about 16 years ago, when I was in elementary school. I borrowed it frequently and read it over and over. The poor thing has fallen apart and pieces of it are all over the house. I should buy her a new copy.Anyway, the influence of this book has followed me ever since. It taught me about color properties: the difference between muted and clear, how to identify a blue-red as opposed to a yellow-red, and more. It also taught me about shape, proportion, and balance in clothing. Most importantly, the book showed me how to figure out which styles and colors would be suitable for me to wear. I don't know how I would have learned any of this without this book.I didn't give 5 stars, however, because the color group descriptions are too caucasian-centric. They should revise the book to be easier to use for more ethnicities."
4,Color Me Beautiful,I was pleased to finally locate a copy of this book. I first 'had my colors done' 20 years ago. In the meantime I have used the information (I am an 'Autumn') to purchase clothes and to decorate my living space. The difference knowing my colors has made is amazing. I spend less money on clothes because I don't bring home things that don't work with my coloring. I don't have a bunch of clothes in my closet that I liked on the rack but don't look good in once I get them home. I have told people about the color theory over the years but have not been able to find anyone doing the color analysis professionally. I finally gave up....ordered the book and now I can do the color analysis for my friends. [...]!
2,Color Me Beautiful,"This book is very old. The suggestions for style are too outdated. However, the information on how to choose your color palette is still good."
3,color me beautiful,"I have a friend who always looks great and knows a lot about what colors look good on others. She told me about the book ""Color Me Beautiful"". I had heard about it and knew it came out a long time ago, but was tired of always buying the same colors in clothes. I've now found new colors to add to my wardrobe. The book was in good condition, just a little yellow because of age.Sue"
2,"Terribly outdated, and confusing for many women.","Any woman of any haircolor and ethnicity can be any one of the four seasons. Skin tone determines your season more than anything else.If you want a book that will really be a big help in narrowing down your season, I highly recommend Bernice Kentner's Color Me A Season. It's much more descriptive, and you will have a much easier time figuring out which colors look best on you. One little secret:Everyone absolutely loves the colors that look the best on them. If you go clothes shopping, and stick with the colors you absolutely adore, you will always look fantastic. Don't just buy colors you like-buy the ones you go ga-ga over, and you'll always get compliments."
3,Color Me Disappointed,We wanted to give copies of this out-of-print book to several young women that we know. My wife had enjoyed the book greatly 30 years ago. Three of the five used copies we ordered arrived in the good to very good condition we designated. Two others were worn with pages worn and discolored and one had pages missing. Three star rating is based on the three very good copies we received. Well try our luck by ordering from the bookseller's whose ratings were reliable.
2,Eighties Flashback Good For Laughs,"This is truly a weird book. Are you winter, spring, summer, or fall? Carole Jackson, with a Dorothy Hamill haircut in evidence, proceeds to group women into one four seasons, each with its own rigid color palette. Do you wear black? Forget it unless you're a ""winter"". Redheads(falls) can only wear olive green, orange, or yellow. Yikes! Try to figure out what season you are. It's not always clear, which seems a bit flawed. This seemed to have a fair amount of marketing involved. I think they had their own makeup line at one time. Anyway, it's good for a few laughs. I think most adults know what colors look good on them, and what you feel the best in."
1,Are you kidding me!,"My sister bought me this as a gift. On the NY bestsellers list for three years???? When, in 1978??????The correct way to wear a scarf to work??? I'm scared."
5,It is 2nd only to the Bible.,"I am 29 (for the past 15 years). I have been using this book since 1989. It has helped me to achieve all of my dreams, make incredible 1st and lasting impressions, save money, and keep my clothes for decades. I am a classic - romantic - winter. I look my best every day. I never wear anything twice. Everything goes with everything. I recently purchased my 4th copy of Color Me Beautiful. I have given it to many, and recommend it to those who are close family and friends."
5,A classic that's fun to read,"You'll get some good laughs, as you follow Tog through the complexities of designing some of the earliest, and still the best, interfaces out there...he was, as I recall, the Interface Czar at Apple when they were creating the Mac, then worked at Sun, and now is part of the Nielsen Norman Group. The book's good background for his site, AskTog.com. You'll get the basics, without the sour looks of some other interface gurus, and you'll get a sense of the way a leading designer interacted with the developers he had to persuade to follow his lead."
1,Completely useless results,The software interviews you and produces documents that are completely useless.It produced a lease agreement that had 4 lines. This is completely unbelievable. How can they sell this software? They need to pull this software from market until they produce something usable.
2,half way there,"The lease it does for a residential rental is poor, the commercial rental lease it OK. I had an old version and it was much better. I purchased the software only for the leasing product so I cant speak to the rest of the program"
1,Not worth the money,This wrap was not soft but yet felt like hard cardboard was inside of the cheap fabric.. You would purchase one of these so that when you did not feel well you would be able to use a soft comfortable feeling wrap to apply to your skin. Well this one is not it. I did have to pay a little bit more for another body wrap\ hug but it is so worth it! Oh and the smell was very unpleasant as well.
2,Too much waffle and repetition,"This book is rather a hard slog, mainly because there's too much waffle. It made me wince to have to wade through paragraphs like ""Web Browsers are HTML interpreters that are designed to understand and render hypermedia. Not only can browsers read HTML files, but they can also read graphic files, sound files and other types of media formats"".Compared to the For Dummies ""CIW Foundations"", this book is a real chore to read. Much of the content simply rehashes what you must already know since you must have already passed CIW Foundations, and the key facts you need for the Site Designer exam are scattered sparsely like pearls in pigswill. Sadly, there are very few alternatives to this book right now. Come on Dummies, give us a better Site Designer prep."
2,Hillbilly Honeymoon Costume,"I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this product. The ""inflatable"" belly that it comes with looks nothing like a pregnant belly. It looks more like a keg of beer in your belly. The hair and veil that it comes with are also not very quality products. The product is so cheaply made that they do not stay on your head. I ended up cutting the veil off and attaching it to a different headband. The dress was okay. Kind of itchy, but not bad. It got the point across, but if you can find a wedding dress at a thrift store or some place cheaper than I would recommend that instead of spending your money on this costume."
3,Somewhat like the Under Review disks,"Well OK I guess. A bit like the Under Review disks. A bunch of critics talking about Neil Young. The difference here is that they show a lot of clips and talk of artists that supposedly influenced Neil.Not bad, but don't expect a lot of Neil. Just snippets."
4,"Great product, but RUNS BIG!!","Very cool product and a must for kids with ear tubes who love water. Nice and light (I was a little nervous it would be too thick and heavy feeling). BUT BEWARE: the sizing guide is off. My daughter has a 19"" head, and since that's right in the middle of the medium range (17-21""), we figured that was safe. Nope. We have to synch it ALL the way...so that just the tiniest bit of velcro is holding it shut and a long piece is left flapping off the back...and even then it's not quite snug enough. To put it in further perspective, a medium fits ME with room to spare (my head measure 22.5""). We will definitely be exchanging it for a small..."
3,the best thing....,"about this movie is the Bonobo tracks in the soundtrack.The topic itself is interesting, but no real need to make a movie. Reading the Times article would be sufficient."
5,The Power of Despair,"I don't think I have ever read a Sci-Fi book that was this emotional. More exciting, inspiring, immersive, sublime... Certainly... But not as emotional... The book explores the unrelenting weight of dark despair on even the most advanced creatures. There is a good dose of Banks' aliens and Banks' plot twists. As other reviewers mentioned, there is not the intense violence of some of the other books. The development of the character Quilan is simply amazing. It is totally weird how Banks can cause you to feel empathy towards a totally alien creature. It almost makes your gut ache in places. Intense book!"
3,Not My Favorite Culture Book but....,"This was not my favorite Culture book. Its difficult to be critic of Mr. Banks, he is among the best active science fiction authors right now. We can only really judge the Culture series against its other installments. This book lacked a hero. I found it difficult to determine who it was supposed to be about. It takes us to some fantastic, well constructed landscapes and those alone are worth the read. The mono-log in which the Mind uses the Title phrase ""look to windward"" was an epic moment in literature. I will never forget it. However, this book was no ""Use of Weapons"""
2,Boring predictable read,"I'm getting more and more annoyed by Iain Banks style of writing. His all-powerful Culture civilization has huge potential and that is what has kept me going. But I have grown to now detest them because of their immorality, their aloofness and their invincibility.I also find his academic style of writing annoying and a chore rather than enjoyable.Throughout the story there are many, many pages of complete waffle that add nothing to the story and appear to be an obvious, but failed attempt, to add some color and depth.Then two thirds of the way through this book, it becomes very obvious as to what the outcome will be. The problem is that Iain Banks has made the Culture so powerful that they are unbeatable and virtually immortal. So any clash with the Culture is destined to fail. So if the plot revolves around a clash with the Culture, as this does, then the outcome is predetermined and the reading boring."
4,More interesting stuff from Iain M Banks,"Not his finest work, but still an excellent read. On the slow end to start, but concludes at a furious pace. Very enjoyable."
4,As good as his best,For those who enjoy Cutlure novels this is as good as the best of them. Some authors seem to lose their way in following up on previous successes but I enjoyed this as much as my first Culture novel.
4,"Should have a ""windows only"" warning","While the book in itself is quite good, it seems to have forgotten that many Flash developers use Mac. All the screen shots are from the PC - and many of the examples on the CD did not work on my Mac OS X Powerbook (using Flash 6 player). The author spends a lot of time explaining the docked panel environment, forgetting (or at least not mentioning) that it is not available on the Mac version of Flash MX.If you use a PC, however, go for it."
1,Stuck in Chapter 9,"After trying to do an excerise in Chapter nine of this book 4 times, I threw this book in the trash and went to look for a better book. This book is a waste of time.I even looked for a web site with a correction, no luck just more books to buy."
3,College Book,A book for my son who needed it for a class he was using. the book was in excellent condition
3,Not Tommy's Accoustical Solos,"This is Tommy's earlier fusion style. I was not expecting that (and no samples were available on Amazon to warn me!) I really don't like the triangle & chimes fusion affects found here -- Tommy is too good for that! Its really a different Tommy. I obsolutely love his newer accoustical solo style which is phenomenal virtuosity. For example: The Mystery, Endless Road, and Only are my favorites."
5,As relevant as ever,"This pdf helped me tremendously in determining just how we incorporate the Internet into our strategy and company. To this day, I still refer back to this timeless masterpiece for guidance, advice and motivation on what the Internet ought to do for our company and how we need to embrace it. I highly recommend this pdf."
5,Excellent for IT development,"A lot of IT developpers forget what is the main essence of a WEB site. This short paper describes how to be efficient and successful according to Porter's theory of competitive strategy.BUT... you might have some difficulty to apply it if you haven't read the theory (competitive strategy & competitive advantage). There are a lot of examples so it's quite easy to understand, even for a beginner."
2,"Good idea, but not very durable","I ordered this product because I liked the idea of it being antibacterial and anti-mildew. I'm not sure what I expected, but as I took it out of the box I thought to myself ""this is just a corkboard"" and wondered if it might have been cheaper to have gone to a home or tile store and bought a square of corkboard instead.I've had this cork bathroom mat for 6 months and it hasn't held up well at all. I put it outside the tub and after 2 or 3 months the corners started to curl up. Unfortunately I accidentally stepped on one of the curled up corners and it broke off. I still use it, but it looks pretty ratty and has gotten darker/grimy from use."
2,Not Sure About This One,"I have had this bathmat for a couple of years. It is not absorbent, which is supposed to be a good thing, but I'm not sure what the point is. So now, instead of standing on the floor when I get out of the shower, I stand on a piece of cork that then has puddles on it. I finally put the bathmat over it, so the bathmat sits on the cork and the floor never actually gets wet. I wouldn't recommend this because I'm not really sure what the purpose of this mat is."
2,I don't get it.,"I've only had this thing for 1 day and it already curled up around the edges. The water takes forever to dry as there are small ridges all over the mat, so when you get out they fill up with water and it feels like you're standing on tiny puddles. Can't recommend it."
1,loose connection,"I paid $30 for this. I use it to connect a MacBook Pro to my iMac. The connection is very loose in the MacBook and falls right out. Doesn't seem to enter the port far enough, so the connection is lost periodically. Fail."
5,Does what its suppose to,It was a little hard to find this cable and I'm happy amazon had it. I use it to transfer video from my HPX170 to my MAC/external hard drive. I only wish it was faster. It takes about 30mins to transfer 18gb (the last time I transferred video).
3,Sent the wrong cable,"The cable is solid. Only problem is, it's the wrong one. I received a 4 feet, 800/400, not the 6 feet. I'm keeping it because I can still use it under certain circumstances, and it's still a good bargain. Didn't want to deal with the hassle of return, so I bought a 6 ft cable from local store for more $"
1,Rip Off Price,"After ordering this cable (for which I paid almost $26) I was referred to an online company ([...]) They had the firewire 800/400 cable. Their price - including the shipping and handling - was $7.20. I've been a longtime customer of Amazon.com and this is the worst experience I've had. Luckily it was a small dollar amount. But, nevertheless...Shame on you Amazon."
5,Just what I needed!,"Got this for the Seagate FreeAgent Desktop Firewire 800 adapter to connect to my computer's Firewire 400 ports.Works as expected without any of the other bulky adapter solutions of other manufacturer's cables.Is packaged within Apple/Mac packaging, but works just fine in GNU/Linux!FYI: Contains a warning on the packaging, ""WARNING This product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm."" I speculate this is because some rubber/metal molding equipment might use lead molding during manufacturing?)"
5,Works perfectly,"Did exactly what it was supposed to do perfectly! I was having trouble with my Firewire 800 and 400 hard drives crashing with my iMac when on at the same time. Using this cable, they now work in harmony."
2,Holy water is not from the river Jordan,"The rosary is beautiful and sturdy but the certificate is not like the one in the picture. It says it is holy water. There is nothing about it being from Jordan. I would send it back but I need it to go with a rosary box I purchased and I dont have time to find another one, on or off line.It is disappointing."
1,"sent a crucifix damaged, I will not bother to return it, okay I lost my money but you lost a customer.","sent a crucifix damaged, I will not bother to return it, okay I lost my money but you lost a customer."
4,Just what i expected,"I love this product, it came on time and intact, beautiful rosary...exactly what i expected it to be!!!!!!! would definitely recommend it."
1,Olive Wood Rosary with Holy Water from the River Jordan,NOT WORTH THE INVESTMENT! After only a couple of uses I had a broken (and missing) bead. I tried to get HolyLand Market to replace the item but the best they could offer was to sell me another one at half price!! Who's to say it would not happen again?? Not wise to throw good money after BAD so I was forced to EAT THE LOSS.
1,AWFUL!,"When I got this in the mail last Friday, it was in good shape (or so I thought it was). Now I have discovered that the centerpiece contains water from the Jordan River was not in the centerpiece and the back of the centerpiece (contenting the water) broke off. I'm so very upset."
3,Very Nice Could Have Stronger Links,I like this rosary. The olive wood beads are very nice. The links however are very soft metal which is a shame because it is a fragile rosary and I am concerned about everyday use.
2,2 Stars for the 20% of the Book Worth Reading,"The first 70 pages, detailing the local history and the actual shark attacks, were interesting and engaging to this Jersey shore enthusiast. Afterward, the author lurches through a mind-numbing, ambling, confusing discussion of what kind(s) of shark might have been responsible for the attacks. I wondered at various points whether Dr. Fernicola might have been paid by the word. In any event, buy this book (if you must--I'll give you my copy for free!) for the history. Watch ""Shark Week"" on the Discovery Channel for a coherent analysis of shark behavior."
2,Don't End Your Book At Chapter 3,"The ""definitive"" history of the New Jersey shark attacks of 1916. And we get that in the first three chapters.And then we get endless speculation about what kind of shark orsharks did the attacking, why it happened, other shark attacks world wide, and author nit-picking with other shark experts opinions -- repetitive and long-lasting stuff.All in all, a good first draft effort. An editor would have had the author revise and restructure, cut the anecdotes, most of the speculation, and about a hundred pages, add some useful maps to show the scenes of action, and it really could have been something."
5,twelve days of terror,"great book couldn't put it down, if you want to read the real ""JAWS"" this is it."
5,Outstanding Read,"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Instead of just giving facts about the attacks, the author really places you in the setting and you can vividly imagine life in New Jersey in 1916. I had read about these attacks before, but never in such detail. I also really like how the author gives you every opportunity to formulate your own theory on what shark or sharks were responsible, as well as his own theory at the end. I will read this book again and for a person that doesn't normally read, that's saying something."
3,Could have been better,"This is an in-depth account of the shark attacks that occurred off the coast of New Jersey and in the Matawan River in July 1916. Four swimmers died. Fernicola does his research, but he doesn't relate what he's come up with very interestingly. Only slightly better is his account of how he tried to determine what kind of sharks they were (probably bull sharks) and why they attacked. Disappointing."
2,Twice as long as it needs to be!,"While the topic of this book is very interesting and the research quite in-depth, I found this book to be very repetitive & much longer than it really needed to be. It was almost as if the author was searching for something more to add to each subtopic but couldn't find anything and so just repeated himself. If you're intereted in sharks or shark attacks at all, you will definitely find this book interesting but beware, you will be reading the same information more than once! Out of sheer stubborness I finished the book but I was relieved when it was over! I'm very surprised that this book has such high reviews!"
4,Jaws- A Real-Life Horror Story,"Having been thoroughly entertained, and terrified, by the original movie, I only recently discovered, following a TV documentary, that it was based on a true story. Needless to say, I tracked down a copy of the book, and look forward to reading it as and when time allows. An initial scan shows this is a very detailed, and painstakingly researched book. Highly recommended.My order was dispached very quickly, and received in pretty much 'as new' condition."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,These pill boxes are made with thin plastic. The size is nice but the lids do not stay shut securely and will come open with handling and all your pills spill out. Since the plastic is thin the hinges are thinner and won't last long. I ordered 2 of these and will use them until they wear out which won't be long. Next time I will pay more to get good quality.
5,great 4X7 day pill box,"Had to replace the wife's medicine sort box for 11 pills& vitamins taken through out the day. Great feature to have the daily units and the holder having the weekday marked on both. Clear plastic makes it easy to see that she's taken the medicine. Most 4X7 setups are single units don't permit pulling the day's pill sets out -or - several if you go out for the weekend.Overall this is a good , sturdy and effective item that should last several years."
5,"An intriguing collection of letters of advice and support, poetry, and other writings from 32 renowned poets and authors","Seeing The Blue Between: Advice And Inspiration For Young Poets compiled and edited by Paul B.

4,The Extecion Cord Saving Machine,I love this product for my comput to plug into it also works good for other gadgets aroung the house. It makes it so that you don't have to run an extension cords from the wall to the compter. It is a great product
2,"Excellent bundle, but description does not mention incompatibility","I was really excited about this bundle because of the large card capacity, professional performance, and the super-high speed reader bundled with it, all for a reasonable price.However, I had to return the product. Why?Because the Firewire reader requires a *powered* connector (the reader draws its power from the computer, it does not have an independent power supply). The device will connect to either a FireWire 800 9-pin connector or to a FireWire 400 6-pin connector, but NOT to a FireWire 400 4-pin *unpowered* connector, which is what most laptops have (Apple MacBooks excepted).That in itself is not the reason for the poor rating I gave this product. The reason for the poor rating is that nowhere is this mentioned on Amazon's product description page."
2,"Beware could be problematic with PCs, works well on Macs","Sandisk say compatable with PC(including Vista) and Mac. I have both at home, worked flawlessly with the MAC, extremely fast. My Dell PC does not recognize it. I also bought a firewire card for my Vaio laptop, same story, Vaio does not recognize it. Took it to Circuit City, their tech support tried it on 3 different PCs on the floor, did not work."
1,Does not work on laptops with XP,I have a 1394 4 pin port on my laptop and this does not work. I even bought a 1394b express card reader (for another $89.99) and this still does not work. Please try on your laptop before you buy. VERY DISAPPOINTING FROM SANDISK. They have clearly marked Windows support - looks like it works only with the Mac.
5,Fast fast fast,"I use this on my mac, and the speed is amazing! I am using the Firewire 800 connection. It has been very reliable, and blazingly fast. Even with a 4 gig card. I have seen no better!"
3,Beware Dell Laptop Users -- XP,"Updated Entry: 5/14/08this reader will not work with PCs/LAPTOP that has the 4pin connector.4 pin is the really small 1394 port and is not powered. the reader will not be recognized by Windows. If you don't have 6 pin or 9 pin ports don't buy it, use USB 2.0 instead. you will get the same speed results.ThanksIf you use a Windows PC with Firewire 4 PIN which is the small connector, you need to purchase an additional cable. the item description on Amazon did not ""enumerate"" the PINs and when you wait for it and receive it, you're a bit disappointed for not being able to use the reader. you can purchase a cable 1394b 9pin to 1394 4 pin from Fry's for $8.00so Have not used the reader for 2 days now because of this!!! stupid design from Sandiskps: wanted to change my star rating from 3 to 1 but you can't edit that."
4,Very good headphone.,"I very like this phone. Its reproduce a big range of sounds. Very quality materials of construction and the cable is long too. I think low level when reproduced music. Dont have level button. If you wish a good headphons, this is THE product."
5,Great Headphones,"These headphones are the best headphones I've ever had. Not only is the sound quality amazing, but the comfort is awesome. I can barely feel the headphones against my head while wearing them. They get extremely loud which is awesome. I have them hooked up to an amp, so I'm not sure how they sound without an amp, but I've been told they do not get as loud. If you're looking for good headphones without paying for $100, get these."
4,Great Headphones for the price.,"I like everything about these headphones except that the stitching is starting to come out a little & they are a month old. Real Nice. Other than that, they are good."
4,"Good sound, hardy, and inexpensive.","Very good sound and extremely comfortable. I use these in my studio every day. I also like how sturdy they are. My Shure, while a higher quality (closed) sound, broke where the ear enclosures expand. Great bang for the bucks."
4,sounds great,"These worked really well for the podcast requirements that I have. I'm not an audiophile or audiogeek, so bought these on a recommendation. Not disappointed."
5,Splendid Sound & Solid Construction,"I'm a first-time K-240 user and I was totally blown away by the sound effect of this studio monitor. It produces accurate, crystal clear mids and highs, and its bass is powerful yet non-distorted. The headphones wear really comfortable and the workmanship is great. The only drawback would be the less desire to wear them outdoors due to their considerable size."
5,These are really nice headphones,I bought these headphones and I pair them with the fii0 e9. I really like these headphones. I really want to try the AKG q 701 and the sennheiser hd 600 to see how my headphones compare to the higher end headphones.
5,Great buy for those audiophiles on the cheap!,"The sound is amazing, nice, and crisp. I use these to listen to music and play games. I would like to note that the bass isnt as loud as i would like but even that doesnt compromise how much I like them. When playing games I can hear everything, and dont even get me started on lossless music, its like orgasms are raining into my ears and did i mention comfort? They are the most comfortable earphones I have ever had!@!@! They fit right on my fat head and big ears but dont squeeze too hard and the fact that they are semi open *or whatever its called* lets me hear things that are going on around me, like someone calling me, timers, etc. All in all 5 stars, great buy for those who enjoy music and gaming."
2,"Good headphones, poor quality","Headphones fell apart after about 3 months of use. The plastic part that holds the 2 metal bars that go across your head crumbled, and they wound up touching the metal screw in the middle (which shorts it, since those wires around the top actually carry the signal to the right speaker). I figured I'd be clever and repair it with solder/epoxy... which worked after some trial/error. But another 4-5 months later, and I'm experiencing the same problems, which leads me to think it has something to do with the way the bars torque when the phones bend slightly. The product wasn't thrown about or abused, but got regular daily use. As far as sound quality, it was very good for open-air headphones. Very easy to hear people trying to talk to me while gaming (which is what I bought them for). Just wish the quality had been a bit better."
5,These are great,"Quality is awesome, using them as a home theater headphone. Great bass response without sounding flat or muffled."
4,Great sound for under 100,"Although the sound is a bit flat in the mid range, the stage is pretty good for the price. I bought these as a carry around pair of cans I could use with my iPhone. It fills that need quite well. Comfy fit, good sound, great value. The negatives are that the material of the pads can make you get a hot ear. I'm comparing it to my beyerdynamics 990. My 990 are super comfy and has a felt like finish leaving your ear pretty cool. Other negatives are the build quality being pretty cheap, and the bulky size.With all that in consideration, I would recommend this to anyone looking for cans in at under 100. At that price I think your top choices are Gredo and Sony and these. All good headphones for diff reasons, but I think this one gets the edge for comfort, sound, and value."
4,K240s Music through rose colored glasses.,"These are wonderful for sitting back and enjoying the music. The ear contour frequency response can dress up an MP3 like a treat. Everything through these headphones sounds fantastic.Unfortunately that makes them practically useless for analytic purposes and they should never be taken into a studio. These ""sound like"" a concert. That step comes after mixing, not during, and not before. Keep these at home and enjoy their bliss. They're not for work."
4,"Comfortable and overall pretty good, but there's better sound for this price","I bought these to replace a lost pair of Grados SR-80's. After using them for most rock and EDM stuff, I'm a little underwhelmed by the sound. You get to hear everything, but it doesn't particularly make your music sound better so to speak. Besides that they're really comfortable. I'm not an expert with this stuff, but I can't say this is the best sound for this price range."
3,Good sound poorly made,GOOD QUALITY SOUND BUT MADE FROM CHEAP PLASTIC THE CIRCULAR PLASTIC BEHIND THE LEFT EAR PIECE CRACKED SO I NEED TO GLUE IT
3,As a long time AKG owner (updated 2/2011),"I had older 240's for many years when I upgraded to these. I paid $200. at that time. They seem to need a perfect amp to sound right. They lack bass and good definition. Even with a headphone amp,on my ipod they sound ""off"". I've been using them now to listen to TV through my headphone amp and I have been mostly happy. However over time the connection/plug where they disconnect to the headphone has become loose enough to ""disconnect"" the sound.The headphones are still good but I can't use them due to this issue. I don't know if the current production run fixed this problem, but I'd advise against buying a headphone that has this feature.Not even listed at the AKG site. Now using my Grado SR80's (a really sweet sound with a tough cord!"
5,Fantastic headphones for the price,"These headphones are a great deal- strong but not overpowering bass (unless EQ'd), very responsive mids and sparkly highs. But the thing that matters most for me is that you get excellent separation and clarity with a pair of midrange cost headphones. I listen to everything from Bach to Minor Threat and these, along with a new non-apple music player, have provided excellent sound. I've actually noticed things in songs I love that I'd not been able to hear before. These headphones are also very comfortable and surprisingly light for their size. I am now an AKG fan."
2,"Not what I wanted, made in China.","I wanted the ones made in Austria, I got the ones made in China. I am sending them back. Not what I expected."
2,"I am not an audiophile, or into recording but I am giving these a poor review because of their construction","I bought these because I was in need of a pair of good quality headphones, with good longevity, to wear while I study for finals. I paid 93.08 cents after taxes for these. The sound quality is what i expected, but the construction of these feel incredibly cheap. I will be returning them in a few days, and ordering a pair of krk kns-6400 or 8400."
1,Tinny and Lacking Bass,"Very tinny sounding and this is on quality tracks... not mp3's. If you like bass/bass accentuation don't bother. The only music I can really stand hearing with these is classical. Also, they are surprisingly quiet. I am generally sensitive to loudness but I found, even when at their max, to be weak with some tracks. I am surprised at how many positive reviews there are of these headphones. They just don't do it for me. I'm sending them back."
2,"Nice & comfy, until they break","I would have rated these as a 4 or 5 until they broke. It turns out the speaker assemblies are held to the headband by a single tiny screw and a low-grade plastic cap. Seriously AKG? They're still under warranty, but what a disappointment.Otherwise, they are very comfortable; I could wear these for hours & hours. The tradeoff is that they are a little loose - I had trouble keeping them in place when playing drums, but great for sitting in front of a computer.I replaced the AKGs with some Audio-Technicas which are louder, still quite comfy and seem to be of much more substantial construction.Update: Attempting to get service with AKG/Harmon under warranty. No response to email for one week."
5,THE NEW STANDARD FOR MY HOME STUDIO SETUP,"The things are built tough, the sound is so neutral and clean, perfect if your trying to mix down a track. It gives a fairness that my Beats by Dre headphones lack, if you can mix your track so that it sounds well in these, then it will sound good on everything else too. I love em, I just might order another pair today."
5,Great Book!,"While trying to find her lovable kitten with the help of the other members of the Baby Sitters Club, Mary Anne almost loses her boyfriend named, Logan."
2,What I think was...,"I don't like this book as much as the other books because you can judge everything by the cover. the ending is not so good either, since I thought this book was not the best BSC book. the moment I read the sentence when Mary Anne left for the meeting, the moment I know what the next chapter's going to be about. I really don't think this is a good book. I dislike the title too. I do not recommend you to read this book, HIGHLY!"
4,The Amazing World of DC Comics,"This book goes over the history of DC Comics. It is a ""coffee table"" type book with lots of colorful pictures. It does a good job of discussing most of the major characters and genres published by DC over the years. Of course, superheroes get more pages than anything else, but they also cover things like romance comics and horror comics. Movie and television adaptations of DC Comics properties are also covered. Very well produced book that should appeal to anyone with an interest in comic books."
4,A good read...,"""Lord of Midnight"" was a good read. I enjoyed it well enough, however it fell short of keeper status for a few reasons. First off...The speed that Renald and Claire feel in love was just too hard to believe..one moment she hated him..then she felt some stirrings of desire then..bam!! She says to herself that this is a man that she will love for always..now...I can understand hating a man, but still desiring him..I can even understand EVENTUALLY falling im love with him, but in this story..it happened so out of nowhwere..I couldnt help but wonder where in the hell I was when this great love developed! I also felt that this book belonged to Claire..I dont have a problem with a book being dominated by one character, but I would have liked a chance to get inside of Renalds mind more often..I wanted to know him better...all in all this WAS a good book, but it fell short of fantastic...still..it is worth reading. I look forward to more from Jo Beverley."
2,Could barely get through it,"I have never read one of her books before and I know I won't again. This book was so boring it took me a week to read it. I usually polish off a book in one night but this one kept going and going. It really doesn't have a good plot I found myself wishing that I could just smack the heroine and make her shutup, but alas it is only a book. Plus the evil sheriff part had me a bit confused as to why he was even included but hey what do I know."
3,Nice ... but DVD manufacturing problem,"As mentioned in other reviews - its very high quality. The movie and extras look good, and the documentary is especially informative. Until this version, every version I had seen of Dark Star looked like it was made by a 50 year old print kept in an attic. If you like this movie get this DVD, but check the next paragraph.My problem with both DVDs and the reason for the 3 star rating is they would not play on my Toshiba Blu Ray player. I have never had a problem with this player before playing anything. Its like the player is choking on some copy protection or the ads for the other products before the menus. The DVDs would play on my Toshiba DVD player but it does make weird whining sound when starting."
1,LAMP BURNS OUT - REPLACEMENT DOESN'T WORK,"We purchased our projector 2 years ago. The lamp stopped working and we bought a replacement ($300). It still wouldn't project light so we called Panasonic Tech Support, they told us to take it to one of their repair shops. They thought it was the ballast and ordered a part. They can't get it to light up and have called Panasonic. During the last 3 weeks that they have had our projector, another one has come in with the same problem. They are still waiting for Panasonic to get back to them."
1,Lamp Exploded after 170 Hours of Viewing,"Purchase the projector on May of 2006. From then on I watched 1 or 2 movies a week. Picture quality was just fantastic. Just few weeks ago, during the viewing, I heard loud pop, I check and it was the lamp. Since I had it for more than a year I figure I racked up enough hours for it to go dead. Put a new lamp and could not believe what I saw, Lamp was only used for 170 H. What can I say? I knew the projector seems unreasnably hot during the play so I clean the air filter once a month. My warranty expired so I am hoping that my new lamp will last longer than my first one."
2,Read before you buy!,"This unit is outstanding if you don't mind spending $300 every quarter on new bulbs.I used PT-AE900 for less than 3 months (less than 400 hours) w/ normal picture setting and fan speed...and then the bulb burned out.Panasonic's tech support line is joke. I spent one hour trying to get a human being on the phone who could process my warranty. I spoke with five people and only one mentioned 3 months/500 hour warranty for the bulb. However, he was in commercial area not consumer and told me to call yet another number.The bulb is SUPPOSED to last around 3,000 hours but in my case it lasted six times less.If you plan on using this projector as your primary video output, don't waste your money and spend a little more for a plasma.at $1,999 this unit is a bargain until its real cost catches up - an additional $1,200 per year."
2,Very Boring,"I wanted to buy the P90X system but was a little nervous. I thought I would start with Power 90. I had just finished a 30 day adventure boot camp so I thought this program would be a perfect follow up. I assumed the four phases meant four different workouts. Boy was I wrong.... You do the same workouts every other day for two weeks for phase 1 and phase 2 is the same just with additional weights. I was bored to death by the end of the first week!! Tony kept messing up on his reps and would do something with his right side and call it his left and then say his right two seconds later. I could feel the workouts working and the ab workout killed me, but after doing the SAME workout over and over and over I just couldn't do it anymore. The mistakes in the video drove me nuts! I should have just bought the P90X and sucked it up....."
4,"Pay a premium, but have a toothpaste your kids use.....","Let's put some coefficients on tooth brushing utility. Toothpaste is an afterthought, maybe 0.25, compared to the brush, 0.35, and simply brushing longer, 0.40. Nevertheless, we want our kids to think, however mythologizing, that brushing teeth is a wonderful magical adventure. To invoke that bit of theatre, we have ""Disney Princess Toothpaste"" for which we pay a premium over good-old-generic-toothpaste. The question then is: is the marginal expense (consumption) worth the additional gain (utility, profit)? My quadratic programming says it is, so that's my story and I'm sticking to it.This toothpaste, therefore, is worth it for the girls in your family, and is adequate for you in a pinch when you are out of minty fresh gel yourself, although this has a rather odd flavor clearly geared to the cartoons and cookies set."
5,"Voices, Visions, and Apparitions","This book emphasizes the supernatural phenomena associated with paranormal experiences such as locutions, apparitions, heavenly phenomena, and communications with divine beings and entities. This work is well balanced and displays a wide variety of such supernatural phenomena. Well researched and appropriately categorized, this work may be used by both the lay person and scholar alike."
1,Might As Well Be Water,This item has no scent whatsoever. Do not waste your money buying this baby cologne because cologne it is not. I would send it back but just rather throw it in the garbage.
5,Love it,Smells great and it didn't cause any allergies to my baby considering that he has sensitive skin !. Highly recommendable.
3,It is good for the price,"I wish the smell was a bit stronger, but other than that, it was definitely worth the price and my son loved it."
5,Love it!,"My son is over a year old and I've been using it since he was 5 months old! My sister in law from California introduced me to baby cologne because she uses it on her daughter too! Shoot, I even use it myself every now and then! I love it! We get SO many compliments on it!!"
4,not too sharp,"Spikes are not too sharp, but the price is cheap for the amount of spikes you are getting. Recommended"
3,hmm..,I THOUGHT THEY WERE CONIC!BUT NO =( THE WERE Pyramid... REALLY PYRAMID... i thought they were pyramid but more conic than pyramid.. either way excellent quality and excellent seller... i got a catalog and love their store...
1,King Size this product is NOT!!!,"I ordered this item based on the (King Size) in the title. I wanted to use it for my air bed. As the bed is 39"" wide, the 22"" width of this product is way too narrow. I would like to know how it could possibly be called King Size at a width of 22""."
2,Noisy Cot,"I did not like this product because although it was sturdy and easy to set up for use, it fabric that it is made of rustles, crackles, scratches and is generally very noisy if you move around on the cot. For a light sleeper, this would not be a great product. I purchased it to use for extra guest, and the convenience of storing the cot. When it arrived, I slept on it the entire night to test it out. The product is fairly comfortable and stable, but the sound of the material is annoying and I could not break it in."
1,Impossible to inflate,I ordered this product for an overseas plane trip. It was nearly impossible to inflate without a compressor. I don't take compressors with me on trips.
1,Not for travelers,"I was able to call the retailer and spoke with someone who was friendly but could not help. In the end I pushed a needle shaped inflator that is used for basket and footballs down the extremely teeny tiny fill valve and discovered the the very thick bottom was a flap that would only partially open to allow air to pass into the air bladder. This valve was designed by a cretin. It would take most of an hour to fill and all day to empty.Thank heavens for Amazon's liberal return policy. My UPS store is 2 minutes walk from my home and the product was on its way back about 12 hours after it arrived. However, in fairness I should say that for the money it is not a bad deal if you only use it at home. You would never, ever want to try and use this while traveling. What a joke."
3,"Comfortable, but hard to inflate.","PROS: Compact when deflated, perfect for backpacking or any travel where space is a concern. Comfortable/soft cover.CONS: Hard to inflate! I feel like I am going to pass out every time I inflate this thing. That's why it only gets 3 stars."
1,Don't waste your money,The inflation valve on this product is unusable. The covering on the product is nice but by the time you are finished trying to inflate this you will be so completely frustrated you won't be able to take a nap anyway.
1,Hard to inflate,"This travel pillow is comfortable...once you manage to get it inflated. However, it is very difficult to inflate due to the tiny blow-up valve. I do not recommend this product for that reason."
4,Great for the money.,"Much more comfortable than other inflatable neck pillows I've used in the past.The valve is a little small and hard to pinch, however, meaning that it can take a while to blow up, and involve getting a little fleece in your mouth."
1,Do I have to be a magician to inflate this?,"The cover is great. But the valve is totally defective, and I should have listened to the other reviews who said it was tricky to inflate/deflate. I could not inflate it. I am a capable adult engineer. I shouldn't have to even think about inflating this--when I need it inflated, it should be easy. This will go back."
3,HARD to Inflate,"I haven't used it yet to see how well it stays inflated. But this thing is a Bugger to inflate!!! Tiny, tiny, tiny valve for blowing it up. Do not recommend if you have breathing problems or get light headed. Otherwise it's just your typical travel pillow."
1,Leaky Neck Rest,"This product was not acceptable. It was impossible to inflate due to a faulty valve, and when replaced, it would not hold air pressure."
2,Too dated to be relevant and too recent to be nostalgic,"I am typically a big Capstick fan. I usually enjoy his interesting and often humorous look into circumstance and culture so far removed from most of us, but this title really misses the mark.The information regarding safari planning and contacts is too dated to be useful. It is missing many safari package types that have become popular since the book was written and there are descriptions of countries that no longer exist. The sections on equipment, from clothing to firearms, are also quite dated.The story fill was a little boring, although the sections covering each game animal type had their entertaining moments and insights. For anyone who hunts, some of the lines were just silly - as when Capstick advised that animals don't present themselves in full profile and sometimes have to be identified in partial view. The book read like a very knowledgeable author stretching to make mundane information appear to be unique insight."
4,Some short term memory loss due to a blown head?,"Head trauma and psychic shock can produce a loss of memory...So we have Andy with a hand gun and Frank with a knifetaking a long hike ( lost ) in the woods.Somebody isn't dealing from a full deck?Some very good acting and a slow turn in the windmakes this a pretty good movie.Th end twist sort of sneaks up on you, like Frank's memory."
2,forget it,"I like Lou Diamond Phillips, but this dvd was very disappointing. The story needed to be better developed and the flash backs were disconcerting. I don't recommend this one."
1,very baddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd,don't buy is very divisive is too good for nothing you cant use these for anything in your lifetime it is useless i will take my money back anytime
3,very small (for toys),"This check valve is very small.1/16 inch I.D. (1.6mm)Pay no attention to my star ratings for this item. I was forced to rate.I'm not sure why they don't list these dimension. I wanted to use it for a motorcycle, but it's way too small. Sending it back wouldn't be worth my time or money.This may be suitable for a RC car or plane."
4,Robert's Rules,"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Robert's Rules is a clear, concise guide for those new to the parliamentary procedures necessary to run an effective meeting."
5,Easy to use.,"Not only is this book well written, it is easy to understand and use. Simple, but not simplistic, almost profoundly so. A good read and a practical guide book for manifesting life goals."
5,Ordering from the Cosmic Kitchen,"Dr. Crane's great book is gold mine of information filled with affirmations and techniques that will change your life, if you apply them..."
5,Showing what we should know...,"This book is perfect in describing what is happening and what would happen if we keep the same corrupt administration we have now! Proving that the government should be as limited as possible, it fueled myself and my political club members at college to work the polls hard for good candidates. It is an easy to follow read and keeps you wondering what the last three pages of the book holds!"
1,not worth the kronar,"I bought this dictionary before going to Iceland for a year as an exchange student. It was useful for the very, very basics...sometimes. I found it frustrating when I couldn't find words in it that I commonly heard in conversation. The lack of cross-references, as noted by another reviewer, serves only to make the book smaller and more useless. If you really want a useful dictionary, do what I did and buy one in Iceland."
3,Small but frustrating dictionary,"While of handy size, and usable by linguaphiles who rely on various alternatives for locating words in dictionaries, this dictionary falls disappointingly short with regards to cross reference (e.g. ""björn"" and ""hreindr"" appear in the Icelandic side, but ""bear"" and ""reindeer"" are absent from the English side)."
3,Good Dictionary,"This dictionary is better than what most of the other reviewers have said. It is not a big dictionary, it has 177 pages, and it only has one column of print, but it has many words in it. Someone said it still uses the letter z, which Icelandic no longer uses. But I did not see the letter z in the Icelandic section.This is not a great dictionary, but it will go along just fine with other books' glossaries."
3,Great Concept But Face is Hard to Read,"The concept is great - automatic syncing with a highly accurate time signal. It works as advertised. I would have given the watch 5 stars except for the following: (1) It was hard for me to read the dial due to reflections and clutter on the dial; (2) At night, it was virtually impossible for me to read the time using the LED illumination because the LED's are on the side (not behind the face) and the illumination doesn't make anything stand out clearly; and (3) the alarm sound was too quiet to be heard in anything but a fairly quiet setting. I ended up returning the watch to Amazon, which has a no-hassle return policy. Try to see this one before buying to see if you're bothered by the things that bothered me."
4,What is Standard Mens Size for length?,"I have a very large wrist in circumference. Will this watch fit? I do not have a measurement though, so this may be hard to answer. Do you take links out of the watch to adjust to different sized wrists? Or do you adjust the clasp to accomodate different sizes? Or is this one size fits all deal?"
3,Pa Pa Small,"Given as a gift, to replace copy given to a younger sibling. Appeared surprised that I found another copy."
3,Old Fashioned Family almost a museum piece,"More than any other in Lois Lenski's Small series, ""Papa Small"" will strike almost any modern family as utterly archaic. Papa gets up in the morning and goes off to work while Mama stays home and cleans and cooks. The whole family drives into town to do Saturday grocery shopping. On Sunday, they go to church.You may find this book charming and it might be a good jumping-off point for a discussion with your child about how your own family differs from the Smalls. But unless you are a Lenski completist, I'd stick to Cowboy Small, the Little Farm, the Little Fire Engine, or the Little Train...those are the best."
3,Good material in need of a remastering,"Although the music contained on this CD gets a five star rating, the recording quality is pretty bad, especially when compared to the original vinyl lp. Hopefully WB records will release a remastered version sometime soon."
4,"Good Grief, More Guaraldi","A painfully short CD with the Peanuts music from television. Synthesizer feels somewhat out of place here but there is much to savor here. This CD along with A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Charlie Brown Christmas are essential purchases. Linus & Lucy, He's Your Dog, and Peppermint Patty are highlights here. Had to dock this CD 1 star because of its brevity (much less than 30 minutes!)."
5,Sublime as nostalgia or 60's jazz trio,This music should sound instantly familiar to Peanuts fans. Of interest to jazz hounds is that Guaraldi largely substitutes harpsichord and electronic piano for acoustic piano in his terrific trio.
1,Terrible,"The quality of the CD was very poor. The case had many stickey places on it, like a library copy.It was not what I expected it to be. I can only give it one star and that's a stretch."
5,Excellent collection!,3 CDs for an excellent price. I love the case and the art. The collection is fantastic and I recommend it to any Janis Joplin fan.
4,Dependable Night's Sleep,"This is a roomy bag that is dependable down to the temperature specified. It packs into a very small space and is well made. Like any good bag, air it out daily and give it a chance to thoroughly dry. I have spent almost 30 nights in this bag and have no complaints at all."
4,Two for One,"BOught this for my daughter's summer reading list. She only needed Time Machine, but it was cheaper to buy this 2-for-1 thing. I remember reading both of these when I was in school and I'm sure she will enjoy them."
4,World's at war,"I'm apparently in the midst of my Martian attacks the Earth phase have just completed H.G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"" and almost now done with Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut. In both the Martian's lose, pops sorry spoiler alert. Well's story was not quite what I expected butnwas still really well written, the man truly knows how to turn a phrase, but is somewhat dated, at least in my opinion. It's still a gpod read, so enjoy."
3,You Can Do Better....,"Unless you're actually looking for the 1964 Warner Bros. re-recordings of the 1950's Cadence tracks, you can pass on this one. As re-recordings go, these are excellent, but most folks would rather have the original hit versions. For the best domestic single-disc compilation, pick up Rhino's ""All Time Original Hits"" from 1999. ""Original Hits"" features the original versions of the Everly's biggest hits, including classics like ""Let It Be Me"" and ""When Will I Be Loved"" that are conspicuously absent from Warner's old ""Very Best Of"" album. My only knock on ""All Time Original Hits"" is that there was plenty of room for lesser gems like ""Claudette"", ""Gone, Gone, Gone"" and ""Bowling Green"" that seldom appear on Everly ""Best Of"" discs."
3,Good but unoriginal,"This is the Everly Brothers re-recording their hits. The CD is good but it should indicate on product pages that these are not original recordings. ""Til I Kissed You"" is always a good song, but again if you want originals pass on this CD."
1,Dating Disaster,"This book is one of those fluff formulaic series like Dummies,but the without the expertise. Helgoe, who has a long term marriage, doesn't have a clue what singles are going through out there in the trenches. Very little solid advice, a lot of trite over used material you can get from the back issues of any woman's magazine.There is a problem with factual accuracy in this book. Page 39...How can someone who has not graduated from High School ""Class of 2005"" be a baby boomer? Alpha missed the boat...both with this series of unnecessary books(WHY ARE BOOMERS OR FAUX BOOMERS AS MANY IN THIS BOOK DIFFERENT FROM ANYONE ELSE??? and this author. This has nothing new to offer. Save your money."
5,A Boomer's Delight,"This is a delightful book filled with useful information that is smartly written. It covers a wide range of issues facing us Baby Boomers who are dating again. It's easy to go directly to specific subjects that interest you, but I enjoyed reading it from cover to cover. The little sidebars, ""From the Mouths of Baby Boomers,"" are especially nice, because they provide the views of many Boomers in different situations and add to the insights of the author. (There's even an appropriate one from the offspring of a Baby Boomer on page 39.) Dating might be tough at any age, but this book is easy to read and lots of help."
5,Must have text,I have used every edition of this book since the first one came out as a single author edition by Dr Dion Bell. The book has only improved as the years went on. This book is not encyclopedic but has the information most needed when dealing with diseases of the tropics and developing world. Even if you have a larger more encyclopedic text you should have this one. This book is ideal for the physician or other practitioner going to the tropics for the first time and who may not have the time for more exhaustive study. Of all the medical texts I have used over the year this is one of the best!
3,"very detailed, but interesting","This book describes very well how insurmountable a task it was to try to turn Iraq into a democracy. The details are many, and can be confusing and hard to remember as you go further into the book. However, he does shine light on what was going on in Iraq--events I heard about through the news. Diamond also acknowledges the shortcomings of the effort, even his own shortcomings (not speaking Arabic, staying in the Green Zone too much and not mingling with Iraqi citizens). The best two chapters are the last ""What went wrong?"" and ""Can Iraq be a democracy?"" He is hopeful, but not convinced. This is a thorough and detailed look at the effort to ""fix"" Iraq--and why it went wrong in so many ways."
5,Iraqi Democratization Efforts Brilliantly Analyzed,"This book is without parallel in the current political as well as scholarly market and is full of valuable and trenchant insights. Besides being a stellar expert on Iraq, Prof. Diamond experienced firsthand the challenges and realities in 2004 of trying to advise Iraqis on how to build a demoncracy. The results are a unique analysis of the political situation in Iraq and the ways that the United States has thus far often unsuccessfully attempted to play a role in the democratization process. SQUANDERED VICTORY is a brilliant and lucidly written book which is a must-read for anyone wishing to remain well-informed on this controversial and critical subject."
5,"Brilliant, insightful, and disturbing","In Squandered Victory, Diamond provides an insightful and penetrating analysis of how poor planning, bad decision-making, and a stubborn insistence on an ideological point of view, in the face of clear facts to the contrary, contributed to the mess that is now a fact of daily life for the Iraqi people and for the world community. Diamond does an excellent job of sorting through a mountain of detail to provide a clear and compelling picture from an insider's point of view. This is a must read for anyone who wants to be informed about the nature of this historic American occupation and effort."
3,What is a Democracy?,"I thought the book was ok, but it bothers me that Mr. Diamond uses the word democracy over and over. We are NOT a democracy. We are a Republic. There is a differance and it is more than just words."
1,Pathetic,"Sad that Christian's feel the need to blame blame blame everything on everyone but their own nonesense. Found this book on a friend's shelf, and now have lost respect for said ""friend."" I find the religous to be the least tolerant of any one sect. Sad, really."
4,A recommended reading,"This is a good read introducing the reader to the New Tolerance & PostModernism. While this book is a little dated, I have found that most of the content is still relevant today. This book is by no means an academic look on the subjects presented, but is rater a motivational read that fueled my passion to stand for truth. Other books on the subject of PostModernism are listed at the end of the book. In my library I own John MacArthur's The Truth War which is a book that exposes the Emerging Church movement & PostModernism. That book I would encourage readers to purchase after you have finished reading this book."
4,Excellent introduction to this topic,"This book is an excellent (but not the most in-depth) book addressing the reasons behind much of the moral decay we see in society today. I would recommend it to anyone who has not read up on this topic previously. The subject matter is presented in a logical, easy to read manner. The only problem I saw with the book is that it did not go as deeply as it could have. (For example, it did not go into the roots and organization of Secular Humanism).As for some reviews saying this book promotes hate, this is simply not so. Christians are encourage to combat the new tolerance with something stronger: Christian love. A beautiful example used to illustrate this call to action was given in which a print shop was being depicted as bigots due to their refusal to print pro-homosexuality pamphlets. Did this Christian print shop respond with hate? No. The Christians met the protestors with love (and refreshments)."
4,Not for all laptops...otherwise great device!!!,"This is a very well designed device with pretty high quality parts. It also comes with a nice set of accessories to fully secure the cable. The only trouble with this device is that most new laptops do not have threaded connector for VGA cables or use HDMI/DisplayPort; thus, you cannot secure this device to these laptops. I use this to lock my Dell E-series docking station to the desk and use another portable cable lock for the laptop. This allows me to undock without playing with any locking devices. You can also lock down VGA projectors that have threaded connectors. With the recent drop in prices this is a steal. If you have the right device then this is highly recommended."
4,Wonderful CTI relase,"This is a good album and very typical of the recordings produced by the CTI label during the early 70's. The fact that the CD is virtually impossible to find also attracted me to it. The production characteristics are excellent as is the musicianship. As a whole the album is entertaining and pleasant to listen to. My only knock on the album is the use of the contemporary pop hits (at the time) as the tracks recorded. This was probably a marketing move to attract younger listeners to the jazz label. Unfortunately, this sometimes sounds like a reheat of songs that were overplayed rather than innovative jazz. I 'm sure that I'm not the first person to knock CTI for this. Overall though I am pleased with this recording."
3,Good value but a big design flaw,"The XP3 is a very good canister filter.The good? 3 decent sized trays, ""priming"" intake tube, configurable outflow tubes, all-you-need-in-a-box package (with exception of biomedia).The bad? The quick disconnect is not heavy duty and can be distorted by any tension on one of the tubes (especially the output)--resulting in a leak because the O-rings do not seat. Also, the o-ring are not a ""tight"" fit and cannot handle much pressure. If you have any inline accessories that constitute a significant load (ie. uv sterilizers, CO2 reactors, etc), water will leak past the disconnect o-rings and onto your floor after flooding the top unit on the inside! Worst of all, this happens after about an hour or so and is not readily apparent!Bottom line: I would much rather NOT have the convenience of the quick disconnect and instead have some external ball valves. My XP3 leaked on my the first time I used it. I searched online and this is a common problem."
2,Warranty is a joke!,"I purchased my filter about one year ago and just the other day the intake on the quick disconnect leaked.I called costomer service,they called me back the next day.(I do agree with the other person on the reviews that said costomer service is really bad to deal with.)He said that I would have to send him the quick disconnect before they could send me a new one out. Therefore, if you want to have there products and expect them to honnor the warranty you better BUY TWO filters or two air pumps.(They did the same to me when there was a problem with the air pump I purchased.)What a good way for there company to make more money.As for the filter operation, it works but I do have a up to 175 filter on a 125 gallon tank, with two large goldfish fish."
1,Piece of junk,"Worked great until it simply stopped working just a few weeks after purchase. No amount of cleaning, priming, etc. will start proper flow again. Will never buy another Rena product."
1,Junk,Rena/Mars Fishcare is the worst company I have ever dealt with. The customer service is a joke. If you can get someone to answer the phone or return your messages all they will do is make you jump through hoops until you are so frustrated you just give up. The whole time your fish suffer. I purchased an XP filter and it quit working after 2 weeks. You're better off spending your money on ANY OTHER FILTER
5,Rena Filstar XP3 is a Great Filter!,"Length:: 1:01 MinsWorks perfect on my 55 gallon, love the easy set-up and the adjustable flow. I also love how the baskets give you the freedom to choose your own media. Just fantastic!"
2,"Not so quiet, works well, but needs a lot of maintenance","If you're looking for a ""no-noise"" filter, I recommend buying a hang-on-back type filter. This canister filter is strong, the motor hums pretty loudly. Been using for 6 months now on a 60 gallon tank with 40 African Cichlids, even with an Aqua Clear 50 as a secondary filter, the xP3 needs bi-weekly cleaning. I have sand substrate and live plants so there is a lot going on. I have to clean it every other week now, the first 3 months it was working flawless without any cleaning. I guess it's time to replace all the media, they're pretty expensive! For the price, it is not worth it! I could have bought 5 x AquaClear 50 and they would have done a way better job!!!"
5,Oscar thing,"The Rena Filstar XP3 is fantastic. My Fluval 404 died after four years and this is a perfect replacement. Made a mild, warm soapy solution for the hoses and connecters...........easily got the recommended two inch depth."
5,Favorite New Band!!,"Wow, this album is awesome!! I have heard tremolo live several times live in San Francisco and they are definitely worth it! This album has become one of my very favorites and I cannot wait for their new one to come out. If you like U2, you'll definitely like tremolo!!"
3,Selected From Carrie Abriged Version.,"I thought the book was pretty good but the movie was much better. This book is a scary kind of non-fiction book. It tells how mean some people can be and how nice a person can be. For instance, being mean like when Carrie gets pig blood dropped on her while she is sitting as a queen at the prom and all the people keep laughing at her. One of the girls who were teasing her felt bad so she told her boyfriend to take her to the prom instead of her."
3,Review for Chain of Fire,"Chain of Fire is about a small town in South Africa called Bophelong living in the time of apartheid. The people of the town find out that they are going to be moved from their homes. Soon the school children start a plan to protest. Naidoo tells the story in a way that makes you really see the story. At some parts it is confusing, but in the end the reader figures it out. There are some suspenseful parts, but it is sort of boring. If the reader likes books on history and rebelling read Chain of Fire."
3,Chain Of Fire,"Chain of Fire is a very interesting story about a young African girl living in Bophelong. The whites that are ruling over her village are now moving all the villagers to another barren village with no water and bad soil. The elderly African people will not do anything about it, but Naledi, the young girl, and her classmates will. They have planned a non-violent march to show that they do not want to leave.Fabia Postel"
5,I read it and it Ruled!!!!!!!!,Author: Beverly NaidooIllustrator: Eric VelasquezChain of Fire is a very exciting historical fiction book. It brings tears to the reader's eyes when the reader reads about what happened to the village people in the book. Along the way some major problems happen; the villagers are protesting to be able to stay in their village.
2,My Chain of Fire review,"Chain of Fire written by Beverly NaidooThe book Chain of Fire is a very historical kind of book which is centered on apartheid. Naledi and her ambitious friend Taolo, decide to convince the whole school to protest against what the white people are doing. The Europeans have decided to move Naledi's whole community to their alleged home town. Naledi becomes voted into an anti-removal committee. Now their forces grow weak and people are hurt; they are determined to continue resisting. Whilst her grandma's condition gets worse, when people abandon others, and when people go missing, Naledi doesn't know who to turn too. How will they stop the police from moving them, will they change things in time, or will they resist...and win...?i recomend this book, escpecially to kids who are learning about African history"
3,Chain of Fire review,"Chain of Fire is a book that shows class, unity and a way of life. The book has so many different selections of themes that at times it gets the reader in to a world where time doesn't stop as the reader will just keep turning the page. Naledi, Taolo and Tiro are a bunch of courageous kids who have taken life as it comes but want to fight because they do not want the government to take their land. Beverley Naidoo shows characterization immensely in this book which makes the reader feel as if they are involved. What Naledi, Taolo and Tiro go through is the challenge of a life time. Can the Chain of Fire fight for what they want and stop the government from taking their life, or will the government shred them to pieces? The Chain of Fire will guide the way for the reader!"
3,Review for Chain of Fire,"Naidoo, Beverley; Eric Velasquez Chain of Fire242, Harper Collins, 1990Chain of Fire is a book that informs us about the struggle of the Africans under the power of the Europeans. The South African government is forcing the villagers to move to a new location which they claim is better and more convenient for the villagers. Beverley Naidoo clearly explains the tale of a young boy named Taolo who succeeds in giving the strength to his neighbor Naledi. With his help they decide to organize an anti-removal march through the village. The powerful illustrations by Eric Velasquez draws a picture into the reader's mind of how Naledi and Taolo have a scorching resistance which cannot be broken, and with every new catastrophe the resistance burns even brighter."
4,Something to read if you like history,"Chain of fire is a really good book that talks about freedom and fighting. This book is about a small village in Bophelong that has been taken over by the Europeans. The Europeans want all the villagers to move from that land, but Naledi and her friends don't like this idea. The Europeans have started acting rudely and have stopped the water supply as well. Naledi and her friends can't take this anymore; they know they have to do something. This book expresses feelings, emotions, apartheid and a lot more. The book Chain of Fire gives the reader the idea of how all the villagers struggled at the thought of leaving their home land and the things they faced while they were fighting."
4,another great book,"This is the second book by Sherryl woods that i have read, and i have to say it was great.. i have been looking for another author to read and Sherryl so far hasn't had a negative note.. 'A love beyond words' was a great story.. Ricky and Allie were very believable couple.. i laughed in some spots, cried in others, and really truely in enjoyed this book.. will be reading it again.."
4,A love beyond words.,"I chose this books because I,'ve enjoyed all the books by miss.woods. The way she starts with the hurricane is very tense and give the reader an understanding of the job the men and women do in disaster areas."
5,Great book,One of her best books ever. I would like to see a series with other characters in this book like tom
4,"Really engrossing, enjoyable book.","Just finished this interesting biographical sketch with interesting insights into the politics of money and self-serving politicians of the late 19th century southwestern US. Illustrates that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Earp and his compadres were fascinating people who helped shape this country's history into what it is today. Who cares about any controversy over the book's content or author...fact or fiction, this book is worth reading. I couldn't put it down."
3,I Married Wyatt Earp,"After reading this book, I couldn't figure out what was fact and what was fiction. I was hoping to get a sense of something more about the man, but Iunderstand that she was trying to protect him and his memory. I love reading books of the Old West, but this one disappointed me in a way. It would besomething if a book came out telling the truth of Wyatt Earp...I'd buy it in a second."
4,I Married Wyatt Earp rings true,"It is surprising to me that this carefully edited and documented biography has become controversial. I have a very sensitive bs detector and it didn't come close to going off while reading this book. The footnotes appear to be very carefully researched and even note the unlikelihood of the truth of some of Mrs. Earp's narrative. If this were a hoax, the footnotes would be crafted to support the truth of the text. In some instances I have been able to look at original documents which are consistent with the footnotes. Glenn Boyer's only problem is he is not a people-pleaser. He is who he is. That he does not choose to fit someone's image of a historian seems to annoy some people no end. He has no obligation to prove his work to anyone. If they don't like his style, they don't need to buy his books. For anyone with any interest in Wyatt Earp, this is a must-read."
5,Glenn Boyer tells Josie's story as she would have had it!,"I think what strikes me most about this book is the author's honesty. I suspect that there is more to this story (and certainly the woman behind it) and only hope there may be a revised edition some day. Many ""versions"" of the truth have been circulated in years' past by many authors.Fabulous job, Mr. Boyer, on telling the story the way Josie would like her life with Wyatt remembered. If it weren't for your years of research and sincere dedication to this effort, the world may never have known that the Earp's were real people too. Thank you for your years of service to help preserve western history."
4,Good to read a different view,"Informative of the way it really was with Wyatt and the relationship between he and Josephine. Also that there was life after the ""ok corral"" incident."
3,Aight! Too Long,"The beginning of the book does move at a fast pace, and keeps you interested. Things kind of go crazy in the last third of the book. The ending is actually a let down, very boring. The entire thing between mimi and Lamont was just way too forced.I am from Ohio, and did not really like the way Mimi was played as some backwoods, country hick. Very stereotypical of east coasters to portray the Midwest that way.There was a point where the number of characters became confusing. And some of the side stories like Sum Wun, and Rayshaun (I was looking for his character to really play a part, then..nothing!) and others definitely needed a good editor.Her use of adverbs to describe dialogue became really irritating.he said hesitantlyshe said irritablyAgain, the sign that her editor did not do their job."
2,Bling...too much shine!,"I am currently reading Bling and I am disappointed to say the least.First there are too many characters, which causes the story line to go into too many directions.While I like the character of Mimi, I felt three characters (the two young singers in the group Heartsong and Mimi's mother) should have been developed. Mimi sang in the group with her friends and her mother wanted to be a singer...this had to have left an impression upon her. As far as the New York characters of Lena and Vanessa, while somewhat interesting, Mimi at this point is still a ""child""...hence her relationship with two ""very worldly"" women which appear to have almost every vice there is between them can only go in a predictable direction.In closing, while I find the information (of which I am sure the Ms. Kennedy has gathered from her own life in this world) about the ""hip hop world"" interesting...I can not recommend this book."
1,Bling? More like Blah,"I am at a loss as to where I should start. It's not that I didn't like the book; I just wasn't very impressed with it. The story seemed very formulaic, I got tired of playing ""I wonder who that is supposed to be"", and in the end I felt like I'd just read one very long, R-rated People or In Style Magazine article."
1,Another Rip-off!!!!,"The last thing we needed was another book about playas and bling bling and all that crap. I couldn't even believe a company like Miramax could fall for trash like this but I guess anything's possible. Several hundred pages of ""drama"", yeah right, more like several hundred pages of ignorance."
2,Not a page turner,"This book was chosen for our book club and it is sad to say that I did not like this book at all. It had way too many non important characters and it was all over the place. Just when I thought it was going to pick up the pace it let me down. This book was way too big to not be able to keep ones attention. It took me almost a month to get through it. I just wish I didn't buy it, I should have went to the library. I can't even tell anyone what the book was about that's how mad I am about this book. If I were you I would borrow it from someone."
2,OK,I bought this book on wednesday and i finished it 2day(saturday)..overall..it was a good book even though it's not what i'm used to reading..it started out kinda boring but since i bought it..i was gonna finish it regardless..but anywho..i liked the book..i wouldn't read it again nor would i recommend it..
5,Very refreshing book,I loved this book I finished it in a few days. I was totally hooked to this one. Especially with the characters resembling to so many of rap and R&B artists we know of. This book was realistic and not too ghetto. Dont get me wrong there is nothing wrong with being ghetto(I speak from experience LOL) But sometimes you just arent in the mood for that and this book was just perfect. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the music industry you will not be disappointed!
3,Nothing like the coldest winter ever........................,Bling was too long for one thing. Would might make a better movie instead. It is urban with hip-hop dialog that I like but I got tired of reading about money and name brands.
2,NO UNIQUENESS ABOUT BLING !,"I will start by giving the author a star for trying to turn the various celebrity stories and pictures into a very loooonnnnggg book, but this book was horrible. It seemed like the author was trying to turn the story of Murder Inc., which was the record label for hip hop artists Ja Rule, Ashanti,etc. into a story. Did this author simply sit in the lobby of the Murder Inc. offices and start writing. By the 10th chapter I already knew how the end was going to turn out. None of the characters were really original in thought, and there was poor usage of real hip hop artists' names throughout the story.I would not recommend this book for anyone who truly appreciates hip hop music and the artists and business people that compose of it. This writer definately needs to try again !"
2,not a true ghetto read...,"i really could not get into this book because it was TOO bushy. it reminded me of how fake people act in the V.I.P. lines at night clubs. it was written nicely (no typos, etc.) but just no where near the level of a Nikki Turner, Sister Souljah type book that i perfer."
2,NBAA (No Bling At All),This book is boring. I'm giving it 2 stars cause I did not buy it. I checked it out from the library.In middle of the book is sorta good. The Outro was the worst chapter in the book. Mimi is a big baby and needs to grow da hell up. She was no better than LaMont with the indiscretion. Lamont with many women and her with this Gemini. The only likeable character was Mama Jackson.
3,Bling Lacks Luster,"First and foremost I have to admit, Bling's story line is mildly engaging, making it a quick read at 500 plus pages, but in the end all is well that ends well in this hip hop fantasy- leaving it predictable and extremely unimaginative. The writing is bad. At first I thought this was supposed to be a satire of the hip hop community, with the books flat characters and their cheesy names but dismissed that theory, early on- Kennedy's writing is simply not good enough to carry a satire but none the less it's a good read when you have nothing to do one rainy weekend. Not worth 25 bucks, buy it used or wait until it comes out in paper back!"
2,Dissapointed,"This book doesn't bring anything new to the world of African American fiction. I started reading Bling three months ago, and now that I'm finished with it I had to rush and let readers know how disappointed I am. It's true that it gives an inside look at the music industry of the hip hop culture, but lacks luster and is very very predictable. I knew everything that was getting ready to happen. Save your money and wait on the movie. Two hours is better than reading 500 pages!"
3,ok,"This book was just ok to me. There was some times when I just got plain tired of reading aobut some of the minor chzracters. It did make me think about all the ""playas"" on the hip-hop scene today."
4,Good Read,"I enjoyed Bling and its cast of characters. The story is predictable, but it is still entertaining learning about the music industry and its excess. Like many others I enjoyed trying to figure out which characters had a real life counterpart."
2,Next Time I'll Read The Bible . . . I Think It's Shorter,"I just finished Disc Two which means I have about 300 hundred pages to go. It feels like I'm still reading character introductions. I'm determined to finish the book, but I hope it gets better. It's a little too descriptive for my taste. I promise to edit this review if my opinion changes, but right now I give it 2 stars, which is very generous."
3,"Fun and Insightful read, albeit a bit long!","I found Bling to be a fun read and insightful to the hip hop/ rap industry which I previously knew nothing about. It does refer to a lot of artists and situations occuring now and that could make the book easily dated in a few years. Like other reviewers, I agree its a bit long, although the pring it large. There were some chapters that I just skimmed over because I did't think they contributed much value-add to the plot line."
4,Very fun read!,Erica Kennedy writes authoritatively enough to make you feel as if you are getting a peek behind the curtain. I love trying to figure out which real-life who went into which fictional character. Someone's going to option this as a movie.Definitely a fun ride.
2,Bling is BLAH!,"I am disappointed in this book. It seems as if the writer just strung together a bunch of stereotypes and real life situations (names changed to protect the guilty)and called it a book. The writing seemed fake and titling the chapters after rap songs was just corny. I should have known something was wrong when, out of all the good hip-hop in the world, she reprinted lyrics by 50 Cent. I don't think this book is imaginative or creative at all."
3,Good but not great,"This is a book that you sort of love to hate. Although it started out good with fun characters and plots quickly the book turned a little chaotic with too many characters whose names are only sometimes mentioned once or twice. It seemed the author developed this story with ease yet 3/4 down the book is rushed; the plot takes a 180 degree turn speeding down a hill. Although I understand the need to use the ""lingo"" in this book, the book is poorly written. Some of the characters seem to be torn in identities (the author didnt know if she wanted the character to be strong or submisive).The story of MIMI is quite interesting and you will have fun reading the book trying to guess who the characters are modeled after. Although the characters are fictional its easy to see which music industry moguls was the author inspired to eanhance.A good effort for a first novel!"
4,Page Turner,"This book was very well written and kept me wanting to know what was next. I took to Mimi's character. She was very sweet, and all she wanted was to have her true talent come through. I was not too happy with Lamount. He was more like a control freak then a CEO of hip-hop music. I like that the book was current and as real as it could be for fiction. I would really consider buy another book by Erica Kennedy. She did a great job."
3,Too Long!,At least one hundred pages could have been eliminated. The book was really slow at first but then it started to pick up at about page 300. I wasn't really feeling the ending. It seems like more should of come of Mi Mi and more focus should have been on her relationship with Gem.
3,Good Vacation Book...,"Bling was a good novel for those going on a three to five day vacation. If it is your intention to read without having to use your brain, Bling is for you. The plot was entertaining, but predictable. The characters came off one-dimensional, and in a 500-page book there was no character growth. The references to all that is glamorous rang true. Easy read, good if you have an abundance of time, but if leisure time is precious, choose something else."
4,Bling was more than I expected...,It's a thick book but definitely worth the read. It was really good!Cindy Boydauthor of Letting the Dog Outwww.lettingthedogout.com
4,Bling,"This is a phenomenal read! Very down to earth and accurate. Who doesn't love the small town girl hits it big story!!! Ms. kennedy has created the read of Summer 2004. And for all of us hip-hop fiends, this story showed the world what goes on in hip-hop-extravagant at times, yet hum. I will now be a fan for life!"
1,Couldn't Even Finish It,"I always finish books. Always. I decided not to waste my time. Got this book free, so thought I'd give it a shot. With Mimi as the main character, I was into it...small town girl makes big...I liked being in her head. But as soon as the cliche female rapper came in, I was finished. I'm not easily offended by anything, but I do get bored when the content doesn't further the story at all."
2,So-so,"Not one of my favorite books, but I kept reading it because I spent $$$$ on the hardcover edition (tying to support a sister who's handling her business) and was hoping that the story would improve. It didn't for me, at least. I also wanted to try to identify who in real life the characters were based on. I didn't particularly like anyone-- and the epilogue was written as though the author just wanted to hurry and finish the book to meet a deadline. However, if you're fascinated by the music industry and all of the movers and shaker in it, you'll probably like it. Don't expect it to be intellecutally stimulating."
2,Need a light gun and power pad.,Get this game only if you have a light gun and a power pad. Other wise skip it.
4,"2 Games are fun, 1 is not",The games super mario bros and duck hunt are very fun Track meet not so much. What you need to play duck hunt is the zapper so it will not work without it.
2,Stopped working,Bought this for young grandchildren who loved playing this even though they have all the current game consoles that they play all the time. However this did not work very long. Would not recommend purchasing used product to anyone.
5,What more can I say it's Mario,It has 3 great games but one thing is for sure if you don't have a light gun or the power pad than the only game you can play is Super Mario Bro.s but hey nothing wrong with that but if you have the light gun and the power pad then this is the best buy for you it's 3 great games in one and worth every penny you paid for it.
1,Virgo1986,"I bought this game to play on my twin console...I was so excited, checking the mail everyday to see if it came in...well jus my luck, i get it and it dosent play...keep getting a no signal error...i was highly ticked off!!! all my other games play, and my whole reason in getting the console was to play mario brothers (i LOVE that game)...oh well, so swell...guess ill have to get it somewhere else"
1,Cheesy remake,"I bought this CD years ago and after moving my collection, I dusted this off. I remembered I didn't really like it the first time I heard it and after playing it again I remember why. It is as one of the other reviewer said... ""discofied tunes"". It's copyrighted 1986, but the sounds are strictly 1970's generic tv sounds. Ugh, everything was so badly synthesized. I bought this originally thinking it was a compilation album of sorts. Hey if your thing is synthesized, disco sounding tunes, go right ahead. If you are looking for closer to original reproductions, look elsewhere. This may actually be the first CD album I considered throwing away, and after the used prices I see it going for I may just do that."
2,need improvement,"I purchase the 3-way stereo electronic crossover to improve my audio system,but it make matter worst.First the hi-pass output quality not bad,but the volume is low even when i increase the gain control to maximum,mid-range frequency not bad ,but if you try to increase the sub-woofer bass-boots volume over half you will hare a humming sound in your bass speakers.changing the sub-woofer low pass HZ frequency dose not help.correct those problem,and you have a good crossover."
2,Uneven coverage of a great man,"I started off really liking this book. The coverage of the Pope's early life up until his ascencion to the throne was very interesting and pretty well-done. Once he got to the papacy, there were two significant problems. First of all, there were whole sections that dealt with the CIA and other government agencies and didn't talk about the Pope very much. More troubling was what the authors did to the story after the fall of communism. It was like a totally different book. The immediately began using words like ""angry"" and ""snapped"" and ""reactionary"" and ""militant"" to describe the Pope's stand on moral issues. After championing him as a her in the fight against communism, they made him seem like a grumpy old man who can't keep up with the times when he dared to take a firm stance against abortion or the ordination of women priests. I threw the book away when I was done. Be smarter than me and don't buy it in the beginning!"
1,wrong book sent,"you sent the wrong book ""his holiness"" by karl bernstien and marco ploliti. i asked for ""his holiness: pope benedict xvi's secret papers"" by journalist gianiugi nuzzi as exposed by paolo gabriele who is now on trial in italy. i was greatly dissapointed as i was looking forward to this expose.please forward same ASAP.thanks, Marisa Lacey"
4,A differing viewpoint,"As a Catholic, I enjoyed this book and found it highly readable. Previous reviewers have cited bias on the part of the authors, and there is some truth to it. But hey, issues such as abortion and contraception are the modern issues the Church deals with, and if they may seem a little anti-Catholic at times, who cares! It's actually refreshing to get a different viewpoint instead of some censured, flowery prose from an authorized Catholic publisher.P.S. Besides, isn't that one of the central themes of JPII's philosophy: respecting people even if they have different viewpoints?"
1,Using a pope's life to stand on a soap box,"The Church changing her teachings regarding artificial contraception and other LIFE issues is like an engineer saying ""well, its time to change that pesky law of gravity."" Bernstein is more interested in his ideology than the life of Pope John Paul II. For a more balanced, scholarly, and less agenda driven biography of the Holy Father, look up George Wiegel. Don't waste your time with these hacks."
3,Don't buy this version-2010 remastered album superior,"Wynn finally got the rights this year to re-release this album and had it remastered. The latter has amazing sound quality. Unfort. as of this writing, no mp3 version of it is available yet on Amazon, iTunes or eMusic.com, so you'll have to spring for the CD, but check the DATE first!"
1,Dont Bother,This is perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read. I was surprised at how truly awful it was. Give me a break! Your lover comes back after 12 years and you just tumble into bed with him and forgive him for basically ignoring and you and being a complete idiot. I don't think so even the villianess is unbelievable. Maybe Ms. Byron should try a rewrite on this one.
3,Promising!!!,"Like some of the other reviewers said, it could have been a lot better, but it was interesting enough to keep me reading. Absolutely not, the worst I've read but not the best either. If you've run out of good books to read and this one is left, pick it up!"
2,okay,"I thought this book could have been better. I had a problem with the husband coming back after 12 years. Sure she loved him, but 12 years to wait for someone who has never treated you like anything but a friend? I don't think so. Not even for a romance novel. And his claim that she trapped him. It did not seem like that to me. I thought the back summary made the book sound better than it was. Is she worth reading again?"
2,I expected more,"I expected more from this book. The main character seemed just a little bit too forgiving towards her husband for leaving her. Later, everything came together a little bit too neatly. However, as a romance novel I expected it to be a little bit unbelievable. This novel is a poor example of romance literature."
3,Delivery was fast,Received my anise treats quickly. The first batch was so smash into tiny pieces I returned them. Another case was sent quickly. They arrived promptly but also 4-5 of the cookies in each batch were broken into several pieces. They tasted great so I ate them anyways!
1,Unbearably horrible...,"Somehow, milking a cow, short sheeting his bed, and buying a stuffed animal just don't seem all that romantic to me. But let's not forget the trip overseas just to visit a nudist beach...Thank goodness I only paid two bits at the thrift store for it. I'm sending it to the free pile at the recycling facility because I can't bear the thought of anyone else spending money on it."
5,This is one of my favourite books of all time!!,"I luv 2 read a book that makes me feel included, as if i am in the room with the characters, and this is one of the first that made me feel that i was being transported to another place.The book is about a girl called Holly, who's mother ran away from Holly's father, taking Holly with her, when Holly was 5... Then, out of the blue, 8 years later, her father turns up outside Holly's school...I really luv this book, and feel that it is the best book that Ms Doherty has written so far, and she would have to write a miracle to knock this of the top spot in my mind!"
4,Informative book!,"This book gives out great information about one of the most dangerous mind-control cults around, especially with the personal testimonies. I can relate to this because I'm a former member of the International Churches of Christ. I definitely recommend it!"
4,"A perfect book for all ""Fall Aways"" !","Unfortunately, I am an EX-ICC member. Though my involvement with this group was short in comparison to many ohters, I was able to expereince many abuses. Many may be quick to judge this book by lack of biblical content but we all need to remember that this book acts as affirmation to certain practices widely demonstrated throughout this cult. Many ex-members do not have a support network because most people can't understand the isolation one feels as they exit the ICC. The only wise words I can offer to any one who has left the ICC, or knows someone who has, ""Fall Away"" is the last lable you will ever become, and that lable is the most detrimental to overcome."
2,The book you don't have to trust,Book that you do not have to trust if only you are true explorer of modern Christianity. It was written with very negative attitude to the subject. So the facts cannot be arranged as true view. Better make your own exploration!
2,"""What is truth? -Pilate asked... ""Crucify Him!""","This book holds a lot a real-life examples from Boston Movement, but is written with the lack of Biblical foundation. It's conclusions are very close to Pilate's in 1st century.What is truth? -We do not know, but let's crucify it!"
2,This book gives more questions then answers,This book gives more questions then answers. It is really hard to trust someone who arranged facts according to negative presumption. May be informative only for critical eye.
4,noisy but gentle on the tooth,"it's NOISY (because it's FAST ?) but the brush (i usually use the small one) is very gentle on the teeth and the gum(it somehow feels like a vibrating sponge ... ) and cleans nicely so i keep using it so far (about a month).(the body says ""cybersonic 3"" and the brush says ""sonic 1"" ... it seems they mean the same thing.)(i tried the big brush, tongue cleaner & floss ... after all i only use the small brush.i like the small round brush which is easy to move around my teeth to clean them.)"
2,Social Handbook,"If one is to believe what he has written, he is certainly a world class ""freeloader.&quot"
4,A good place to start exploring.,"This book provides some interesting theories and some good beginning info about the various secret and not-so secret societies. However, it needs to show more clearly where some of the information is coming from. It's one thing to say, so and so was a mason or whatever, but where did this come from? How do you know? The flow is a little dis-jointed and scattered but it holds a reader's interest. It definelty gives some good background and will pique your curiosity to learn more. Coupled with some of Graham Hancock's stuff and you will come away with a really new perspective on history."
1,Poorly designed,"If you want a trouble free set stay away from Samsung. These units have a color wheel, 3 fans and a 250 dollar lamp that need to be replaced periodically."
1,Was Great the 1st year and a half,"Was Great the 1st year and a half, then started getting flashing lights across the screen, they say we need a new light engine at --wait for it--$1500.00No leeway from Samsung cause this is not supposed to happen, no I didn't get the extended warranty.If you are going to buy Samsung you better get the extended warrantyI am off to find another brand and forget that Samsung exists"
1,Never buy Samsung DLP tvs,"I have a HLN 4365W and despite the good quality of the picture, it has been the most expensive TV I have ever owned. The light burns out every year, which costs $150. I have it the shop now and was told it would cost about $500 to replace A DMD board. I paid over $3500 for it 6 years ago and now I think I'm going to dump it for a different make TV (Panasonic or Sony)."
1,"Product not ""Adult"" size","Product is not as described and is way too small for an adult. Should be listed as ""Child Punk Mullet Wig""."
2,Giving the Devil Her Due,"One has only to read the reviews on the book jacket to know that they are in for a biased account of O'Hair's life and death.One compares O'hair with her killer, ""Her killer was as bright viscious and devious as she was."" As if to say that opposition to Christianity and a little conning are as bad as murder. The other reviewer calls O'hair's death ""poetic justice"". Very Christian like, indeed.In these times when religion and state are all too intertwined we could use another O'Hair, even with all her faults. We may not be able to stop Bush's mixing state and religion at the poles but Madalyn may have stopped him through the courts.Unfortunately, for those of us who are curious rather than vengefull, this book doesn't sufficiently recount the tactics O'Hair used to get prayer out of schools.What it does point out, perhaps inadvertantly, is the bias that officials showed whenever it came to performing their civic duties as they related to O'Hair's predicaments."
3,Tellls of murder but is pretentious,"Basically I read this book because it is the only one available about the murder of Madalyn Murray, her son and her granddaughter. While the author did cover Madalyn's life, her assorted shennanigans and did cover some about the investigation ( or lack of it) into her disappearance, I feel that the author took on a purple prose, somewhat mocking attitude towards Madalyn Murray. The details of the investigation and the discovery of the bodies is barely more than one can find online in the crime archives. Granted the subject was a crass and crude person, but I think she deserved a better tale of her life and the circumstances of her murder than this book. There are some interesting bits, such as what Bill Murray heard when he finally reported her as missing to the police, thus the three stars. Worth a read but not comprehensive."
4,Fascinating story!,"I wouldn't classify this as a ""biography,"" but it was a very interesting tale of O'Hair's life (and death). I hadn't followed the case against her murderers when it played out; it was quite fascinating to read about it.Despite what some of the reviewers have written, I didn't think this was a biased book. Hey, it's hard to portray as a saint a woman as wicked as her. Regardless of whether you agree with her Athiesm, she WAS an evil, greedy woman who bilked many of her supporters out of thousands if not millions of dollars. Sadly, it was greed itself that led to her murder."
4,Very informative and influential author.,"I am interested in finding an email address for Mr. Garrison or someone that could answer some questions I have regarding financing a mortgage. I have also read Mr. Garrison's book titled ""How to buy your own home in 90 days"". This book was very helpful but I still have questions. I have searched the net for a site that might be helpful but have had no luck as of yet. Any information will be greatly appreciated."
2,"Bare bones USB 1.1, not for keyboard or mouse","Potential buyers beware!This switch is for USB 1.1 only. It is not capable for switching keyboard or mouse USB connections, only other peripherials. The way switching works is analogous to unplugging the cable from one computer (losing all peripherials) and connecting to another (and having to go through the discovery process). I did expect a little more from a MSRP $60 product, but at bare minimum it must handle keyboard and mouse. It is going into the great useless USB junk pile..."
3,Excellent for use as a DSL switch between computers,"I use this device as a switch for my DSL line between my two computers. There is no degradation in the up and down speeds and the DSL modem uses this switch as a automatic reboot between the two computers. Furthermore, you can use this switch as a safeguard to physically cut off the DSL modem from both computers by switching to one of the unoccupied USB locations. It is a simple, excellent convenience."
1,Poor Choice As A Cheap KVM (-V) Solution,"This switch only operates if the USB cable connected to port 1 is providing power. This means if you're trying to use the switch to share a peripheral (in my case, a USB hub with my mouse and keyboard connected) between two computers, the computer on port 1 must always be on. If this were redesigned to accept power from any one port (or to use an external power adapter), I might be able to recommend it. As it is, it's a bad choice for anyone who doesn't leave one of their computers on all the time. I'm returning my order."
1,"Looks nice, but its only usb 1.1","I purchased this to share a usb drive between two computers. Unfortunatly this no where on the packaging materials does this say what usb specs it supports. I had to find out the hard way its only USB 1.1, so its pretty much useless junk since its way to slow, and way over priced. You can buy and have shipped usb 1.1 switching units for less than $10 on ebay. So why would anyone spend the MSRP of $59 on a unit like this. All around its not worth the money, and the manufacturer should have the guts to put the specs on there packaging materials. If they don't, then its not worth buying. I took mine back for a refund the next day."
3,Space Saver,"I love the fact that I am able to store my brooms and other floor items but unfortunately I was unable to utilize shelving. The broom , floor duster, and hardwood floor mop are all too tall. I really needed the shelving to store cleaning products. Other than that it's perfect."
3,Article on atheism by professor of theology???,"Haven't actually seen this but just want to point out that the article on atheism is written by John F. Haught, Senior Fellow, Woodstock Theological Center, Georgetown University, formerly professor of theology at Georgetown (A Jesuit University). Why do I suspect that the topic will receive a somewhat less than sympathetic treatment? What does this say about the treatment of other subjects?"
2,Good book but the Online Companion is gone,"I found this book to be a very readable guide the beginning Javascript user. However the ""Online Companion"", an internet site that the authors are constantly referring to is no longer available. So unless you want to key in all of the scripts by hand I would recommend a book with an included CDROM. - R*N"
4,Best javascript book around,"I think this is the best (and most current) javascript book out, especially for beginners. This book and it's companion reference book are all you need to start writing javascript."
5,"This author truly understands the ""Conversion"" aspect of RCIA","This author truly understands the ""Conversion"" aspect of RCIA. Vatican II envisioned the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA) as a process of conversion of heart and the growth of love for Jesus Christ. Dennis Chriszt fully understands this. His book wonderfully illustrates what this means both to the parish and the RCIA. As the Director of our RCIA team, I consider this one of only a few good books that discuss the Period of Mystagogy. He helps us understand that true mystagogy begins throughout the RCIA process and is necessary for the entire worshiping community."
1,Very unhelpful book! Not recommended!,"This is the worst book on mystagogy I have ever read! Please do not read it- if you are a true follower of the Precious Blood, you will know that it is filled with lies. If you want to read a DECENT, TRUE, CATHOLIC, WORD OF GOD book about mystagogy and how to help catechetical teams, I would recommend ""Catechism: The Real Word of God"" by Rev. Francis Miller, or ""Mystagogy Demystified"" by Sr. Tabitha Mary Andrews. They are independently published and difficult to find, but the work of searching will bring true rewards! Best of luck to all and God bless."
3,Very Disappointed!,"After reading high praise for Cheryl Barker's Butterfly, here and elsewhere, I was expecting great things and tried very hard to like this performance, but I could not. The singing was just not that good, and by good I mean pleasant to hear. Ms. Barker's lower register was beautiful, but all the higher notes (and that's what makes the opera!) were unpleasantly harsh. To be fair, this probably came across better in the theater, and her acting was good. Sharpless and Goro were OK, but other performances were not that strong vocally. Scenery and costuming were a bit unusual, and there were a host of nonspeaking characters, dressed in yellow moving around the stage, which detracted from the drama, in my opinion. But none of that would have mattered if the singing had been good!"
5,King size,"I just received 2 Rio Adventure Military style king size cots. They are well made and very comfortable. Just unstick the velcro to make inserting the end bars easier. The plastic/rubber end cap of one leg was split and fell off, but RIO has a replacement parts phone number and will ship missing or broken parts at no cost.The 2 cots just fit, with no room to spare lengthwise, within my Eureka 9X9 dome tent. Highly recommended!"
4,cot,I purchased this to use in a spare bedroom. Both my adult sons have used it and both say its comfortable for a few nights. Its extremly large and roomy. Its easy to put up. The only difficulty is the end stability bars. They fit very tight and are difficult to put on but once they are on the cot is very steady
5,very great,this band is very talented...with this album not being there best it is still a must have or just to listen to alot...the bad part for me is i ordered this cd 2 months ago...still havent got it..:(
2,"Great stuff, low value",Overall the book (if you can call it that) does offer what its supposed to and does that in an effective manner. It teaches you how to develop persuasion. The trouble though is it only gives you the most basic outline on just 11 pages. The information that is contained inside of it is something that has been available for years in other similiar books.
1,This is an over priced rip off.,I bought the identifier for my wife who likes bird watching. I also bought these cards to cover more birds. But they only cover a few birds. It is a waste of money. I returned them.
4,Different,"I have been purchasing this product for 2 years and have always had a difficult time getting the Myrrh oil out of the bottle because it was thick like a syrup, usually took the dripper insert out of the bottle,now the Myrrh oil has a more thinner consistency. I hope they have not compromised the quality of the oil by diluting it."
5,Sound and helpful,"This is a heavy duty theology book written for the everyday person. I highly recommend it.Even though it is heavy going at times, Carson is able to bring big ideas down to the level of the average reader.Every Christian needs to heed Carson's advice and build in their foundation so that they will be able to withstand in the day of trouble."
5,"Excellent book, very helpful",Carson provides a work on this subject that is extremely helpful to theologians and laymen alike.
2,Ok....,"I was hoping for more. The author presents several Biblical truths which he encourages are to be used as foundations for thinking before tragedy strikes, but, one is still left with questions of ""why?"" However, answering the why's of life can only be done by God Himself.The book is rather scholarly. I suppose I was hoping for some more anchors I could hold on to. Also, the subject of God's sovereignty and Man's free will/choice is mentioned, but, the resolution of this is that one must not emphasize one over the other. In other words, one must recognize the existence of both of these truths. But, understanding the two, or somehow reconciling the two is beyond any human author."
4,Touch And Feel Bedtime,"Wonderful conversation peice for interested children. This book is constant pre-bedtime entertainment. We enjoy reading, most books are great books."
3,This book is too old for 16 month old Ayla,"Ayla has little interest in this book for some reason so I rated it with 3 stars. However, later on I'm sure she will love it as it is beautifully illustrated with many bedtime items to touch and feel. She just loves lifting the flaps books, I'm afraid."
2,"Daring, but not necessarily accurate","This book is daring in the subject matter that it deals with. The description of Callie and how she thinks and feels is very realistic and well done. My only complaint is the reason that she cuts herself. It feels as if Ms. McCormick pulled back shy of giving Callie significant problems. Most often self injury is caused by chronic abuse, here it is relegated to a happening after one traumatic event which is not really as traumatic as it needs to be to carry the story. Still a good first novel."
1,Unrealistic!,I am a cutter and was before I read this book. I hated this book. Patricia Mccormick's writing style is childish at its best and she lacks a real connection with the main character. This book is more like she read up on the subject instead of talking to cutters. Which I think she should have done. The main character seems so unrealistic to me. I could not connect with this book. It's not a great peice of literature. I would not beg anyone to read this book if my life dependened on it.
5,Hope.,"This book should be called ""Trigger"" because that's what it is. It's an amazing book, it really is. It is just a trigger for self-harmers. I used to cut. I'm about seven months clean. It's harder than I thought it would be. The author of this book wasn't a cutter. When I read that, I was amazed. She does so well writing about a teenage cutter. At the end of the book, I felt like there was....hope? I guess. It's really hard for me not to cut. I quit smoking when I was sixteen, and starting cutting the next year. Sometimes I feel like the walls are caving in on me. Like I'm running out of air, and my lungs are clogged. They won't work again until I cut. Then when I do, the pain is gone, I can breathe, and I'm okay. Until the next time. I know I need help, and it's books like this, and authors like this who write books like this, that make me see just how much I need help. I have no support, and I'm alone, but I'm trying. That's the first step, right?"
5,Masterpeice.,"This was an amazingly short read, but very compelling book. Patricia was able to point out that not every kid who cuts is completely morbid and worthless, that its not ""emo"" kids who have the big problem, its just kids who have a hard time dealing with their emotions. She did a great job illustrating the facility in which the girls stay and created a very loving and genuine therapist for Callie."
4,"Great, quick high school read","I read this in one day, its that quick and easy. Definitely great for a high school sophmore or anyone who knows a cutter."
3,Good but lacking,I liked this story. It had a good concept. Interesting characters yet at the same time there was something missing. I was left feeling empty.
3,Not What I Expected...,"I used to have a similar problem, so I was immediately drawn to this book. However, I was a little disappointed because the story was mostly about what was happening in the institution. I wish it was more focused on Callie and her life at home. After reading the book, I still felt like I didn't know her as well as I should have. It could have been a lot better, but I still enjoyed reading it."
2,McCormick falls short.,"The beginning of Cut by Patricia McCormick , is the only interesting , exciting and intense part of the entire novel. Once you get the idea of the story and get to know the characters there is nothing else to it. I felt like the whole time I was reading I was waiting for something interesting to happen . When I got to the end of the book and nothing new or exciting had happened I felt that I wasted my time. I would not recommend this book to any young adults because I feel the book would not hold the readers attention."
4,Very good,"Callie doesn't talk to anybody, even if she tries and wants to. She knows all about the other people in herr group, yet they wouldn't reconize her voice if you spoke. The people at Sea Pines or as her roomate, Sydney, calls it, Sick Minds, might let her go becuase she made no progress at all.And there you are, her saciatrist. Who sits in a room with her every day watching her count the stripes on the wallpaper.The novel helps you understand what it's like to be in a fascility like her's and helps you understand the reasons of people's actions. It was a good book in my opioion and is recomened to all who plan to read it."
2,whoops!,this book is irratting. especaily the part where she cutts her self with a pie pane. she thinks 'its never hurt before' i dont think a 'real' cutter would think that. it allways huts. its reatching out and harnessing that pain. this seams like what would happen if i tried top wrihgt about a cocain addiction. most people wuld belive it but people who have expirianced the real thing would be quite angry at the little fuzzy details.her issues are much to clear. the book would be better if they were fuzzed up a bit. maybe take out her brother compleatly. she seams like a good girl. happy and creative.and allso the floor doesnt feel like it's tipping when you cut.
3,Cut,"I think this book was a really good book for someone who is younger and is not familer with cutting,or even someone who wants to know more about the mindset of a person who does this. I think that it would also be a good book for someone who may be on the anti-social side and needs some help learning how to open up."
3,a shallow account of a deep subject,"Callie is a young teen tht has alot of presure at home. When she was watching her smaller brother one night, Sam had a asthma attack and Callie has to find her parents. She tracts her dad at a bar, and they go home and take Sam to the hospital. Sam almost dies and the guilt causes Callie to start cutting herself to deal with her guilt and feelings.She is sent to sea Pines a ward for troubled girls.She make some friends and starts healing at the centre. This story was a quick easy read, it was kind of shallow the characters were not well formed as i thought they could be. A better book on cutting is Willow."
5,I'm Sobbing...,"...but for a good reason. I myself have struggled with cutting, and this book is so amazingly accurate in its portrayal of this condition. The character of Callie was so realistic that I felt for her, and really wished I could be there to give her a hug and reassure her (though I can tell that I myself need some reassurance as well). I loved this book and would definitely recommend it to cutters and non-cutters alike."
1,The book that ruined my life,I hate this book. It told me about cutting. I started in seventh grade. I've been to mulitiple therepists. Everyone thinks I've stopped. It's 9th grade. I have fresh cuts.
2,Too graphic for young children,"I don't know what I was expecting when I picked up ""Cut"", but I'm glad I didn't expect anything. This novel passes out many ideas of problems that could influence children and teens."
1,Not a very good book.,"If your looking for a really short, somewhat dull novel, buy this. I did not like this book at all."
1,...,"Have you ever read your five year old sister's diary? If so, this book will remind you of those good o' days. The grammar bad, no... did I say bad? I meant...HORRIBLE. Here is a quote from the first few pages of the book... ""I don't tell her..."" What the hell? Why not try I DIDN'T Mrs. Mccormick? Is American grammar too good for you? And what the hell were the editors doing? Don't they check for such errors? Argh. I am a writer myself and it just pains me to see that any old hag can publish a book..."
2,Not up to Cut,"In ""Cut"", 15 year old Callie suffers through the trials of self-injury. Patricia McCormick, although seemingly has educated herself on cutting, fails to show its true effects. Having been personally involved in self-injury, I know that the author does not give an accurate depiction of what it's like to be a cutter. In reality it is much darker and harsher than in this book. Enjoyable, but not very realistic. Ms. McCormick would have benifited more from writing something shockingly true to life."
2,From another former cutter...,"I first read this book when I was a 9th grader. I was disappointed in it then, and I am disappointed in it now.I have been a cutter since I was about 12. I am 21 now, and I don't do it anymore, but the impulse is always there.The author doesn't really seem to get cutting. I agree with another reviewer, another former cutter, when she says that the author has never seen blood seep through her skin, has never waited in that impossibly long moment between cut and release. She has never known all the pain inside of someone who does it.It shows.This book could be about a girl who simply stopped speaking because something bad happened to her brother, she'd still have ended up in the psychiatric unit eventually, believe me.I'm just so disappointed in this book."
4,CUTting edge,"If you have ever read SPEAK by Laurie Anderson, you will love CUT, written by Patricia McCormick. CUT is a thrilling, keep you reading, fiction book about a young girl named Callie and how she is dealing with her problems. Callie is at a ""residential trearment facility"" called Sea Pines because she cuts herself. While she is there, she becomes mute, and does not have any friends. Callie has to over come all of that, stop cutting herself, and realize that her brothers sickness is NOT her fault. Can Callie do this, or will she just take the easy way out and cut herself?This book was excellent, and I would definently recomend it to any teenage girl."
3,Semi-Decent Young Adult Book,"Definately not a hard read for anyone, but an entertaining one at least. The characters are likeable, the descriptions true to life, and though the ending is rather abrupt, it doesn't take away from the book itself."
5,Great book,Cut was a great book. It helped me through alot of my problems and helped me realize that I am not the only person with these peroblems. After I read the book I was convinced in getting help and trying to stop. I give this book 5 stars because it is realistic in some of the parts and it is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.
4,"Good Book, but not for me.","I enjoyed the book very much. It has everything you could want. I picked it up in my English class as an assingment, but it was so much more for me. I self-harm, how the book was put in front of me; or even further, why the book was put in front of me, I don't know. I have talked to a few other people who have read the book who also self injure. They came up with the same conclusion I had, If your looking to stop cutting; don't read the book. Through the beginning and middle it has a force that makes you want to cut more and more, and I did.On the other side, if you dont self injure and are looking to find out more about it, or just find a good book you found it."
4,Helps you understand what cutting really is,"15-year-old Callie is a cutter. Anything that's sharp enough to break the skin and tear her away from the clinic she's been sent to is her idea of paradise. She keeps herself isolated from the others and doesn't speak to anyone. She keeps her opinions and answers locked inside where they can't be heard. But when a new girl shows up with the same problem, Callie learns it's better to talk.It's was a great book, especially if you know someone who is going through the same thing."
3,The Review of Cut,"I think this was a really good book. It explained what its like to live in rehab and not only for drugs. A young girl was in the place because she had a problem with cutting her wrists. The book was different in many ways; explaining life as a teen with problems. It was really weird to read what some people do to just hurt themselves. The book explain how young people want to get help in life. In some parts of the book it was kind of gross and disturbing, but overall it was a good book.It was almost a mystery, becase the girl wouldnt talk so no one could help her and at one time she ran away. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries."
1,Not my selection,"I purchased this book and the other similiar ones at the request of my boyfriends daughter. I had been telling her how good reading is for you. I really don't condone the subject matter, and wish I had not ordered those kind of books for reading material. I hope she enjoyed them. I will never know. She never thanked me or mentioned it again."
5,Great,"The detail and the way she thinks about things is so descriptive. I've never cut myself, but by the way she describes it...I feel as if I can share her emotion. I would recomend this book to anyone!"
4,Cut,"The book Cut is an extraordinary book. It's about a little girl who cuts herself to ease her problems. When she shows the guidance counselor she calle d her mother. They decided to send her to hospital called Sea Pines.She doesn'r like to talk,but when a new girl who has the same problem caomes everything changes. I would reccomesnd this book to anyonw with a caring heart."
4,I recomend it for older teens,This book was very good in my opinion. It explains how a girl started an obsession of cutting herself.The story is set in a rehab-like facility.It gives you a glimpse of what it would be like to be in her shoes.I like the way it was written because it keeps the reader involved in the story.I think older teens would appreciate the story more. Also I would not find it to be appropriate for anybody under the age of 14 mostly because its a little graphic in nature.
4,All Too Real,I read this book because I have had a friend who cuts herself. I realized what kind of thoughts she was going through and I knew what she was thinking. It really scared me in some parts but in others I was glad I knew that kind of information. This book is really good in how it can take something like a year into a very short book. The only thing I would have changed was the length of the book. It could have easily been longer. But I have to hand it to her. The thoughts that the character had are oh so true.
4,An amzing page turner!,"The novel Cut by Patricia McCormick is about a girl named Callie who cuts herself and is in Sea Pines which is a rehab for people who have to get better from bad habits like cutting themselves, drugs, etc. When Callie first arrives at Sea Pines she does not like to talk to anyone, not other people in the clinic or her counselor. Cut is a step by step experience of how Callie coped and dealt with her cutting herself. I really like how the author set up the story. I like having to guess why Callie did not want to talk, why Callie cut herself. Cut had me guessing up till the very last page. I also like the vivid details the author used to describe scenes in the book; it helped me picture what Callie was like and how it was like living in a place like Sea Pine. I think all types of people will love Cut because it is just an amazing page turner and well written!"
5,Cut,"The book may not be long but it is amazing non the less. i definitly recomend this book weather your a cutter or not, it was amazingly written as well. 5 stars for sure!"
4,Great Book!,"I would just like to start off by saying that I am not much of a reader...I have to REALLY REALLY like a book to be able to read it. Otherwise I think to myself, 'Even though this book bores me, I'm still going to finish it. I'm not going to quit.' But I always do.I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK!It really shows you how the life of someone who self-harms truly is. You go through the struggles with her and you really feel for her. At the end of the book it says that the author, Patricia McCormick went and talked to girls in a hospital who self-harm. She really did her research, and it shows in the book. It doesn't sound fake like a lot of other books about people who cut.I would highly recommend this :)"
4,Interesting read!,"Patricia McCormick wrote a very interesting novel on a girl who cuts herself. Callie, a young adult, blames herself for her families problems. Her brother Sam had really bad asthma, which makes her mother worried and always busy. Her dad has to work more so he can get more money to pay for everything. Callie lives at Sea Pines, or as the girls there call it ""Sick Minds"" rehabilatation center. At first Callie doesn't talk and doesn't care about cutting herself, but over time Callie starts talking to other people and another girl who cuts herself comes and tries to keep her down, but with the help of the other girls their and her pyschologist, Callie finally realizes that the problems at home are not her fault and finally wants to get better. Callie becomes closer to her dad and the rest of her family. Patricia's book was an easy which I would recommend because it shows the true meaning of family and how you shouldn't be so hard on yourself about problems."
2,Poor and very inacurate,It was obvious that this woman did not actually understand this disorder and was horrible at stereotyoing every other disorder discussed. If it will help people cope with this disorder that's great. However this book was anything but great.
2,Disappointed with content,"this book may be a good read for a young teen but i felt it was simplistic and superficial. As a mother of a self injurer, I was looking for some insite and understanding. There are books on the market with much deeper understanding and accuracy of the dynamics of this complicated and heart breaking phenomenon. It was an easy read and i read it in a couple of hours but it really only sctatches the surface"
1,What the hell!,I read the summary on this book and thought it would be a good read. I was wrong way wrong. Its about a girl who cuts herself and does'nt talk to anybody. She she in some kind of mental institution with other girls with problems. I started to read it figuring out why this girl cuts herself and doesn't talk to anyone. The ending was very dissapointing. The whole rreason she was doing this to herself is because she thought it was her fault her brother got sick by yelling at him. And she thought of herself as a bad person. That was it. Seriously thats why she was cutting herself. What a lame ending. It would have been better if she had a good reason for cutting herself. Like if she was abused or raped or somethi. But no she cut herself because she thought she made her brother sick. Luckily i was able to get this book for free. But save your time and money and dont get this book.
3,Okay/Not Impressed,"Most people I know whom have read this aren't cutters. I was, I am. To me, this didn't capture the pain well enough. It didn't make me bleed [figuratively] with the writing. It felt kind of cliche, stereotypical, and Callie's reason to cut... well, it just didn't ""fit"" to me. Like there wasn't enough pain.. but then again, I've never been in that situation. If you're looking for a good ""teen problem"" book, go for Ellen Hopkins or Perks of Being a Wallflower."
1,One of the worst books,"Maybe this is just my opinion, but I don't understand why everyone is handing out five stars for this book. I really tried to get into the story, but it was just so boring. Through out most of the book nothing really happen. I never read Patricia's work before yet still I expected more and was extremely disappointed. There was this whole long part in the story where the main protagonist wouldn't speak, so there wasn't a whole lot of dialogue. Maybe this is just my opinion, but I really don't think you should waste you money, or even time by renting this book at a library."
2,Beware of offensive language,"Callie has been confined to a mental hospital because she cuts her wrists. There are many other people at the hospital who do destructive things to themselves, too. At the beginning of her stay, she doesn't speak to anyone - not even the therapist. As time goes on, however, she contributes to the group sharing time and shares with her therapist the family trauma that induced her destructiveness.For mature readers only because of language and adult subject matter (Tiffany is telling us about some guy she had sex with)."
1,There are much better reads.,"I read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend who had found it interesting and insightful, but I had to disagree. I found the book dull and bland, with one-dimensional characters, making them difficult to relate to or have any empathy for. There are many other books containing similar stories that prove to be insightful, touching and funny, but this isnt one of them. I imagine that the book wasnt researched extremely well, as if the author had had more knowledge of the subject matter, she would have been able to write it more effectively and convincingly. I would recommend autobiographical books on subjects like this as they give more insight into the issues involved while still being entertaining and funny reads, as the authors can draw on their own experiences rather than plucking stories from thin air, which, as demonstrated in ""Cut"", does not work."
2,Far too sterile to represent reality.,"As much credit as I give to anyone willing to address the issue of self-injury in their work, Cut does not come close to conevying the tumultuous thoughts and feelings that lead one to harm themselves. It might be enough to trigger someone who cuts, but will hardly educate those who don't."
2,Uninformative,"This was, I believe, the first book I ever read about self-mutilation. This was before I ever started the act. I thought that this is how it was, and that you didn't go through much, but that is not how it is at all. There are so many things rushing through your head and so many feelings. This doesn't happen with Callie. They never really even give a reason for Callie's cutting, so it just seems sort of wasted and purposless. I know you do not always have to have a reason, but there was more information about the other girls than the main character. I don't know anyone who could relate to this book, and if you are a self-mutilator, you want to read books that you can relate to and make you feellike you are not alone. I do not recommend this book to anyone. The author did a poor job with her ""research"" in this field."
1,There is no proof of honest feeling here.,"I'm not going to make this long, but here goes:The plot for this book is not horrible, but it resonates Girl, Interrupted - which is annoying, to say the least, because it doesn't seem original. Second, she never really goes into the actual cutting, explains the emotions, or educates in any way - which only shows her lack of research. I found this unbelievably disappointing - being a recovering cutter myself, I found it interesting that somebody would go to all the trouble to write a book and not make it accurate.I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who's looking for an idea of what cutting is really about, or to educate themselves about this disorder."
4,Cut by Patricia McCormick review,"Hey hey hey, I definitely recommend the book Cut by Patricia McCormick to anyone who is or was having troubles in their lives. It tells of how Callie is a wrist cutter and, she goes to Sea Pines to get some ""serious"" help. She soon discoveries that her life was only horrible because she made it that way. She is now having a positive outlook on the world.So no matter how horrible your life is, it's only that way because you make it that way, and your life could change in a matter of moments, just like Callie. That is why I really recommend this book to all of your troubled teens."
5,Cut: The Self Mutilation Eye Opener,"Personally, I loved the book. I thought it was well written and it captured the main character beautifully. I could really see myself as her; going through her problems with her parents and the hardships of not speaking to anyone else in the institution. I could feel her pain and relief whenever she would cut herself. I could also imagine her sitting in front of me, making me the counselor for her therapy session. Many people are naive and think that everyone cries or bottle up their feelings inside, but this book opened my eyes to a new world of emotions; the craving for something to help you forget your pain, and the wanting to go home."
3,Good but could be better,I liked this book. I think it is good to bring up current issues that teens deal with today. The only problem I had was that the characters needed to be better developed.
4,A Cut Above,"Sorry about the pun. I read ""Cut"" in three hours in one sitting. Callie is a teenage girl who is seriously depressed, so depressed that she cuts herself as punishment and winds up in a place she and the other patients call Sick Minds. Callie doesn't want to get better, though, she wants to hurt herself because she feels she doesn't deserve any better. The other girls in her ward suffer from other manifestations of self-hatred, including anoerexia, overeating, and drug abuse. One of the saddest characters is a girl who carves herself up and calls it art and denies that she has a problem. I would like to know her story, too. ""Cut"" is a must-read for anyone who is concerned about teen depression. This is a riveting first novel and I look forward to Patricia McCormick's next one."
5,A Real-Life Story,"This is a book that really shows what a person who cuts themself can be thinking. I used to cut myself. I started when I was twelve years old. I'm not proud of it, but it gave me insight on things. This book is really good for... well, describing what it's like to have the need to cut yourself, and what it can do to you. I had a very similar experience to Callie's, except that Callie was 15 and I was 14. Anyway, you came here to read a review, not me yakking on about my meaningless life.Cut is a really good book about a girl named Callie who cuts herself (hence the title). She is in an institution, and she doesn't talk. The other girls talk, the girls with eating disorders and drug abuse, that sort of thing. Then a new girl comes, with the same problem that Callie has, except that Amanda, the new girl, shows off her scars with pride. This starts an emotional trip for Callie, and you, as the reader, follow her through every step of the way."
5,"""CUt""","This was a great book about a girl named Callie who cuts herself. Now Callie is in a mental facility, or a looney bin as some people call it. Sea Pines, or Sick Minds as the people who attend it call it. There are other people there who need help, her age and older. There are people there with drug abuse problems, and food issues. But, how can Callie get any help, when she won't even talk? Callie has had problems at home, is that why she is cutting herself? Find out bye reading this wonderful novel by Patricia McCormick. This is one of the best books I have ever read, and i would definatly give it *****!"
3,Cut,The book Cut by Patricia MaCommick is a great book in my opinion. In the beginning I didnt really like understand why someone would cut themselves just to make themselves feel good. I would think it would hurt but i guess for some people it makes them feel good. But in the middle i understood why she cuts herself. Things look hopeless for her at the beginning but then it starts to show that she wants to get better. I didnt really like how it ended by how her dad just dropped her off back at Sick Minds and then it ended. I would recommend it if you dont get grossed out of blood and stuff. I am sure you will like it. So go to your local library or book store and buy your copy today!
3,Cut Review,"Cut. It wasn't my favorite book in the world but yet I didn't hate it either. This book seems realistic. If I was to rate this book on a scale of 1 to 5, I would give it a 3. I would give that because I have read some better books but yet it wasn't the worst book that I have read. I mean I can't really relate to this because I have never done anything like Callie has. Neither do I know of anyone who has done any of these things. This book is about a girl named Callie who cuts herself. She never cuts herself deep enough to kill herself. She only cuts herself to relax herself, so that she can feel the high or rush. Callie is now in an institute for girls that have problems. Some of the types of girls that go to this institute are people with eating disorders. The name of the institute is Sea Pines. Callie calls this place Sick Minds."
4,Cut,This book is about a girl who cuts herself. Her parents took her to a mental institution. While she was there she was really quiet and never talked. When she got there she ran away. She called her dad and her came and took her back.I really like this book. It inspired me to help people I know that cut themselves. I'm looking forward to reading other books about people who abuse themselves.
3,A cutting review!,"I am reviewing the book ""Cut"". In my opinion, this book was cool, and I enjoyed reading it. I gave this book three stars for several reasons. In some areas of the book it would get boring and it wasn't as creative as it could of been. But under all that the story is good, and i incourage anybody to read this novel for the great plot and the bizzar twists that this little girl is facing in her life. But you should check this book out, its interesting."
4,"A great, short, but fulfilling read..","I first read this book a couple years ago when a friend reccomended me to read it. At the time my best friend was a cutter and I thought through this book maybe I could find some answers as to why people cut and how to help them. Actually I found the book to be more story-telling than informative on the subject of cutting but from Callie(the main character)and my friends perspective, I discovered that cutting is something very deep and personal. I also found more importantly that it's something that you can overcome.I decided to write this review because I was searching through my book shelf recently and discovered Cut. I read the book again in one sitting and I had the same pleased feeling as I had when I first read it. I think of my friend now, who is doing much better and hasn't cut for a while now. After she and I read through the book the first time she bought me my own copy.Now go read it for yourself and share it with your friends :-)"
2,The title is decieving...,"This book is supposed to be about cutting, but it's really more about a psychiatric hospital. As someone who was once a cutter, it really doesn't address the issue of cutting as well as it seemed it should have. I was under the impression that it was a novel for adults on the issue of cutting, but it was written more on the level of a young adult and didn't really dive much into self-injury as an issue. It made cutting seem as though it was something you can turn on and off, just as Callie's talking was something she had the control to turn on and off. Unfortunately, cutting is nothing like that. Yes, McCormick does touch on the emotions associated with the act of self-injury, but she doesn't make known the need for those feelings, or the cycle of emotions that a cutter goes through before, during and after commiting the act. It was an easy read - I read it in one sitting, but not what I had expected."
2,Definately not written from experience..,"Although I do see how Cut would be appealing to curious young teenagers, I found the plot behind Cut to be very weak. Cutting doesn't seem to be that huge of a problem for Callie, yet she gets sent to Sea Pines/Sick Minds for it, whial realistically, people go for years without being discovered as a cutter, and when they do, they usually only get the help of a psychaitrist, not a full blown mental hospital. Some of the emotion was genuine, like the desperate cutting with the plate, and giving herself up to the nurses. But in general, the characters were weakly developed. I have yet to read a book that captures the emotions behind cutting accurately, though.This is worth redaing, as many people enjoyed it."
5,"Amazon Review For the Book ""CUT""","In the book, a girl named Callie has to go to a center called Sea Pines to get help. Callie is in a group of other girls who have to get help with different conditions that they have. She has to learn how to deal with her mother's attitude toward her, her brother's sickness, and the fact that her father is always gone. The hard part is that she has to deal with all this, and she can not cut herself.I like this book because it is a real life situation about a girl with problems, and it shows how different people handle and overcome dangerous situations. The important meaning of the book is that this problem really does happen to people and it is a serious issue."
3,Doesn't even scratch the surface,"Although this isn't a boring story, if you are looking to discover more about the way the mind of a 'cutter' works or understand it any way this book will not help you. At no point does the book confront the inner workings of Callie's mind, it simply narrates the happenings of her life at 'sick minds' from a somewhat impartial point of view. In my opinion it didn't scratch the surface of this issue at all. If you are a stranger to the idea of self mutilation then you may find this book informative and interesting, but to someone familiar with the topic it comes accross as a story that glosses over what is really going on."
2,Entertaining but unsatisfying,"I thought the story that happened at 'Sick Minds' was good, but the main character's story was bad. The ending left much to be desired, and it seemed that the main character never really had much of a change."
2,Nothing too great here.,"This book really doesn't delve too much into its subject matter.The ending just left me wanting more, and the beginning wasn't so great either.It just seems like it was pieced together and not well thought out.It's a quick read but nothing great."
4,New approach for young audiences,"If I recall correctly, McCormick approached writing this book by researching young cutters and getting their perspective. Keep in mind that this book is written for younger audiences. For young cutters, it presents their situation in a way to make them feel as if they're not alone in their struggles. Isn't that what's ultimately most important? It may come across as contrived or condescending for older audiences, but not for all."
2,Pointless,This novel was well written but at seemed to leave us hanging at the end of the book which to me seemed pointless.
3,powerful silence,to me cut is a good book because callie's silence is powerful. being thrown into a crazy situation ( one of which i can relate)is hard enough talking about it is harder. this story is somewhat of a mystery because you want to know what's bothering her.
4,Pleasant read,"No gory details in this book. It's pretty balanced throughout. Basically it's a nice story with a happy ending. But it does show there are other ways of dealing with life, when everything gets too much. One of them is self-injury.If you want to read a longer and more in-depth story as to the background of why a person would want to self-injure, I recommend reading 'The luckiest girl in the world' by Steven Levenkron."
1,Bad idea for the youth,Bad back lash! As a cutter myself for 8yrs before I discovered this book in school on day in middle school incouraged by teachers I was horrified. I've had many emotional problems and I refuse to read this book. My problem is that it is being given to suck a young group of people. I remeber because of this book my friend started cutting. Stupid right. The book is being taken to seriously by the youth but the education of the topic is good.
4,WARNING-SPOILER ALERT!!! C'mon people!,"We're not supposed to know why she cuts herself. It's told in the firts person. We are Callie. This is why we visit the counseler-to find out why we are cutting ourselves! SPOILER ALERT!!! That is why she goes back to 'Sick Minds'. I like this book because it does cover different issues. Maybe there is a part II in the works. I think the title is misleading. The emotional parts of the book to me was when she -SPOILER ALERT!!! speaks. Maybe call the book ""Cut Mute"":)"
2,not descriptive,"Cut was interesting, but i was looking for a book that could paint a picture of the situation and this one didnt. It should have told you more about when she was cutting. Sorry Patricia McCormick, but i only give cut 2stars"
5,cry blood,"This book was mind blowing. I have the same problem as Callie, I cut myself, for the same reasons as she does. I recommend this to all, especially those who have a friend or family member who cuts. In this book, you can see and feel our emotions. It hit home and showed me that I'm not alone. It gave me hope and strength, it was a emotional book. Read it!!!!"
5,Changes your Perspective!,wow! this book was good and well written! I would recommend it to anybody. I loved the way the author really got inside Callie's head and her thoughts. it really portrayed the characters in such a neat way. A well written -all-round great book!
3,Shallow,"This book was an engaging, easy read. It would be great for an adolescent. But, it doesn't go deep enough into what is going on in her head, or how she gets out of it. It's a good book for younger readers, but older readers will not be satisfied."
2,Another Voice in the Same Spirit,"I'm a cutter, just like Callie, the main character. And I, have also experienced Callie's footsteps in a mental facility with others. I have to say that the book was pretty much accurate but the emotions were a bit teetery... First off, the plot is pretty bland at the beginning and I had a hard time searching for the real main conflict. What's really clawing and eating Callie? Why does she hurt herself? At the end, the resolution threw me off and I searched the book for hints that could've lead the reader to predict this resolution. I found about one or two but they were really vague to my mind. Second off, the story doesn't give too much about what goes on inside Callie's mind but more of the world around her. More of the physical and less of the emotional. I'd recommend this book to 11-13 year olds but I think a much more intense book about cutting could satisfy the interest of those older."
3,Most Depressing Story.Ever.,"I remember having to read this for school and it just broke my heart. I'm giving this three stars not because of the quality, but because of how it makes you feel after reading it. For parents, I'd recommend reading this before your teens read it. But I think it's important to see what self-destructive behavior can do and how it can ruin your life. I remain a changed person now, just by reading this book : I gained so much more appreciation for everything I have, and I gained a much better comprehension of how serious this situation is. The author did a great job capturing the full picture in the viewers' mind."
3,Enlightening.,This book brings to light a topic that is not often talked about in schools because there are so many other issues out there for kids these days. I think that this book does an excellent job of enlightening kids about cutting and other issues that kids struggle with in a way that they can understand.
4,honest and real,"Callie is a cutter, she dosen't do it as a suicide attempt to more to relief the pain bottled up inside of her that she cannot release. Now she's attending Sea Pines or as the residents like to call it ""Sick Minds"". Callie dosn't want to tell with them or anyone, and stays silent, but how long can she keep quiet?This book was a fast-paced and quick read, but still very effective and touching. I enjoyed the characters and thought them all to be unique and impactful in their own rightful ways. You call tell it was well researched and that the author knew what she was talking about as well as the struggles and personal demons that the girls faced, felt real and not overly embelished.I love reading books regarding mental illness and the struggles that people dealing with it face, and Psychology has always intrigued me, but I do think theres a false stigma in our society of why people cut and this book definitely opens your eyes to the feelings and thought process behind it."
3,CUT,"This book is more for audiences who can handle gory scenes. I would still recommend it to lots of people. Callie is a teenage girl who has a problem. She cuts herself. Not deep enough to die but enough to feel it. After awhile she is sent to a residential treatment facility where she is supposed to get better. She doesn't talk much, actually she doesn't talk at all. The people around her call her S.T. for silent treatment, she just doesn't talk to anyone. Once her brother gets sick with asthma, her mother stops doing many things. She even stops driving because she thinks it's too dangerous for him. Callie feels it is her fault Sam is sick, but that should be the least of her worries."
3,"good, but not what i expected","this book was a very good and intense read...but it wasnt really what i expected. the girl in the story indeed cuts herself as the title may suggest, but there isnt really much in the book about cutting. if youre looking for a book talking more about cutting, i wouldnt suggest this. but it is a good read nonetheless."
5,Cut excedes expectations,"I felt like I was in the book and I was going through all of the things that Callie was going through with her. I couldn't put it down. ""Cut"" deals with a series fo real-life problems like eating disorders and self-mutilation. Callie cut herself to relieve pain and stress. It helped me understand other people do this and I can stop if I put some effort into it and get help. This is the best book I've ever read."
4,Cut,"The book I read was ""Cut."" The book was interesting with all the different things she did. When I read the book, it felt like I was actually in the story, and I could see all the different things that was happening in my mind.In one chapter she was running in a cross country meet, and she blanked out and ran home. Then when she got home she ound herself bored. So, she cut herself for the first time, and then she watched the blood run on to the floor.If you like books that flow and are very interesting, then I suggest you read ""Cut."" YOU SHOULD REALLY READ IT!!"
5,Bill Cosby,This was a cd that I had heard when I was a young girl. At that time it was an album. The quality of the cd was as good as the original album. I'm so thankful that Amazon had the cd.
3,"Cosby, Finding His Voice","This early album from Bill Cosby was a warmup for the classics, like ""Wonderfulness"" and ""Revenge"" that would come later. Cosby was usually at his funniest as a standup comedian when talking about childhood, and there's not much of that this time around. Instead, most of the material is standard standup stuff, relationships, other drivers, etc., that have been well worn. The set piece to this recording, Cosby's three bits about Noah and the Ark, are mildly amusing, but don't have much of a payoff. Nevertheless, if you like Cosby's standup material, you will probably find this an enjoyable album."
4,Bill Cosby Is A Very Funny Fellow Right!,"He is funny without the foul mouth, very funny fellow........."
4,Where's the DVD?,"I saw Bill do the Noah routine on TV a long time ago, when I was a kid - his facial expressions and actions made it far funnier than just listening to it. I laughed so hard I cried --- WE NEED THE DVD!!!"
2,CD Bill Cosby is a very funny fellow - Right,Enjoyed the content but a bit disappointed. The original was a 33 1/3 RPM Recording that had a lot more content. I judge this CD to only contain about one-half of what was on the recording.
1,Not what I expected,"Twenty four pages fell out, not good.There was not great dealing with fresh flower arrangements which was disappointing, more silk and dried flowers.The description of how to arrange was not informative enough for me.But I am a novice.Disappointed!!!"
1,Falling Pages,The day I received my book in the mail I opened it and began reading as I turned the pages it began to fall apart. All but a few of the pages have come off the binding. The book is in pieces. I would not recommend it to anyone unless you want a book you have to pick up the pieces evey time you want to read it.
5,Livelihood -- the movie,"I will confess upfront that my son was a co-writer, director and produced it. I also acted in it. BUT, for a movie done on a limited budget, it is one funny, entertaining film. Urge you to snap it up. You'll love it!"
2,"Good plot, poor writing.","While a plot-intensive story, the writing, itself, leaves a lot to be desired. Frequent misspellings, grammatical and punctual errors, incorrect usage of terms, as well as abrupt changes of the reader's point-of-view make for an arduous read. As enjoyable as the plot is, I think Mr. Reid should contact his editors for both reimbursement of past funds, and to inform them they will not be working on future projects. The quality of the text in this book is roughly equivalent to a non-edited, non-proofread fanfiction, and I feel a bit short-changed for having spent money on this. I can only hope that Mr. Reid improves the quality of his books in future."
3,DVD cover misleading,"Specifically, regarding Alpha's Bells of San Fernando. The source print is fair to good with a few sporadic missing frames. Some scenes are soft and others are crisp. The soundtrack is good. Better-than-usual Alpha release.San Fernando is a town in Paradise Valley which of course must have been the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles long before the gringos arrived. Juan Mendoza and his henchmen are holding the residents as prisoners.Michael O'Brien from Ireland, is hanging out in Paradise Valley and has fallen in love with Maria Garcia, daughter of the local blacksmith. Michael stands up to Mendoza and then plots his overthrow. You can deduce the ending.This is not a cowboy nor western-themed film but rather an historical drama with a cliche love story. Entertaining but not worth more than five dollars and really worth just one dollar. Unfortunately, the dollar store mavens have not released this, so Alpha is your low-price leader."
2,Don't Judge THIS book by it's cover!,"Although i expected this book to be as light hearted and up beat as it's colorful cover, i actually found it rather depressing and sad."
1,Insipid,"I took it out of the library, made it halfway through and am quickly sending it back. I found it totally insipid and found the author's portrayal of Judaism vulgar and offensive."
3,The process of forgiveness,Outlines the process of forgiveness very well although I think the book cover and the title are misleading. The book would be more usefully served if the title and cover were more indicative of the content.
3,"Wasn't that great, wasn't that bad","The book was honestly not that bad but I do agree with others. It seems like she needed two more chapters so she added two more characters. Definetly not a book I would buy...if you have a library card, use that. Don't waste your money on it."
3,"Not fluffy, but not bad, either.","I started this book on my lunch hour yesterday, and stayed up late last night so I could finish it.I thought it would be a funny, fluffy chick-lit novel, but it definitely is not that. However, it's not a terrible book, either. I think Rose spent too much time on some characters, and not enough on others. I enjoyed reading the novel, but it wasn't one of my top 10 reads."
1,Waste of time,"Definitely not light, fun, beach reading. The story was disjointed, and I didn't like any of the characters. I struggled to get to the end of the book, and when I reached the end, I felt I had wasted my time."
3,Good quick beach read.,"I liked this book well enough. It began great and ended up so-so. I liked the topic, the characters were fun to read, and it was well written. I did think it was superficial, and could have had a messier ending, as opposed to everything tying up nicely.It was a quick read. Great for a weekend by the pool or at the beach or river.Jodi"
4,very funny and surprising,"I started this book expecting a fun read. I got that and much more, a very funny, very surprising, utterly engrossing story, more Mary McCarthy than Helen Fielding. A sometimes scathing, always witty, and ultimately very moving look at a ""group"" in a period in time and their struggles with love, marriage, children and identity."
5,"I'm a guy, and I loved this book!","Couldn't put this down -- not the kind of book i usually read, but I found it engaging, entertaining, even moving -- and so damned funny. I mean it, this is such a winner! Totally surprising, and a great find. Read this book, you won't be disappointed!"
2,Not At All What I Expected,"With its bright colors and fluffy preview on the back, you would think this would be a light, fun read.However, it is not, and I just cant understand how other readers can say that it is. If you are expecting a fun Shopacholic-like novel, or even fun interesting charachter novel, it is quite a dissapointment. It starts off innocently enough with one girl not seemingly to fit in with the others- havent we all felt that way? But instead of just being picked on, which is painful enough, she is actually abused by fellow campers. It goes on from there with stories of gang rape, sexual abuse, molestation, and neglect, with more than a few disturbing images. This book is packaged as one thing, and it in the end is quite a different thing all together. While it is well written, you can't help feeling at the end that you are glad its over, and that you were somehow tricked into reading it. Not a feel good novel."
1,A Total Disappointment,"From the cover, I was expecting a light, fun, and funny book. As it turns out, The J.A.P. Chronicles was dark, depressing, insulting, and at times, vulgar and disgusting. The book seems to make light of issues such as gang rape, molestation, hazing, neglect, and abuse. From personal experiences, I do not believe that this book portrays at all what ""jappy"" sleep away camps are really like or what happens to ""jappy girls"" when they get older. How others could say that this is a ""quick, easy, and feel good book"" is beyond me. I agree with PaperBackReader's review, ""You can't help feeling at the end that you are glad it is over, and that you were somehow tricked into reading it. Not a feel good novel."" I would not recommend this book to anyone that I know. It was truly a total disappointment."
1,Hated it.,"Totally disappointing. I was looking for some easy reading chick lit, saw the cover of this book, scanned the back, and checked it out of the library - thankfully I didn't spend any money on it. I hated it - around page 38 I was pretty sure this wasn't what I'd hoped it would be, but I finished the book because I at least wanted to know what happened. Turns out, nothing worth reading happened.On top of that, it's felt like there was a lot of gratuitous sex and bad language. The writing isn't great, and there's not a solid plot line - just a bunch of stories that are somehow tied together because the girls all know each other and some of them are in contact with each other.Don't waste your time - find another book."
2,Great plot - bad execution,"Being a camp girl, I was really looking forward to reading this book and imagining what my former bunk mates are up to these days. I just finished studying for a major exam and was ready to get lost in a book. The J.A.P. world is not one I'm familiar with so it seemed all the more perfect escape. However, after an initial good introduction, the characters' personal demons overwhelm the book and the author does not do a good job bringing the unearthing of these demons back to the point of the book...the post-camp life defining moment in the women's lives. The individual women's stories get lost in too many details - often sordid - so the reader is left disliking everyone. Unfortunately, Ms. Rose doesn't give us much to like about anyone or anything in the book."
1,Depraved!,"Although I literally couldn't put this book down, I spent the whole time reading it with a sick feeling in my stomach. I, too, saw the cuteness of the cover and thought this book would be light and fluffy. Wrong! Each character faces a most horrid reality and the reader plods on - hoping for a bit of sunshine to break through. Just when you think the story couldn't get any worse, it does... Despite the author's talent for writing - it was almost as though she was desperate for shock value. I know Stephen King wrote a book entitled ""Misery,"" however, this novel would be more suited for that exact label!"
2,offensive title makes it hard to get into,"I just saw this at the bookstore, and spent the past two hours reading it. I have to be totally honest: I really couldn't get past just how offensive I found the title. I really just felt that the ethnic/religious slurs/cultural stereotypes-- even if this title was used simply for its gimmicky-ness or to get commercial attention-- was really plain-old offensive, and much as I tried to see past that, I found myself not really willing to give the book a chance at all because the title made me uncomfortable. Granted, I understand the idea of how a book can play with stereotypes, but this book just seems to reinforce terrible, hurtful, and *false* cultural stereotypes for laughs. I would have lightened up if the book felt funny or did something satirical or clever with the stereotypes, but, well, it just didn't for me. Oh well."
3,electronic meditational music,"call of the mystic is a group of european guys collaborating on music that appeals to all spiritual aspirants. while meditating or contemplating in the early stages of spiritual awakening, it is sometimes very helpful to listen to some music to settle the mind. bahramji is such a group to listen to. food and music have a very unique quality,they reflect the consciousness of those that prepare and serve it. there is a mixture of tradtional indian instruments,the acoustic guitar and some really cool electronic stuff that puts the spiritual filling in the ol music pie that is bahramji. listen to this music and remember that you are the infinite universe-we become what we think we are-so, what do you think?"
2,"Good start, then went downhill fast......","I heard the first song (Giving it all away) on the radio and was blown away. Ordered the CD from Amazon. After just one listen, I haven't listened again since it arrived. One play through was enough. Just not my thing. (except for that first tune) I think a Cockburns' Greatest Hits compilation might have been a lot better. Jussayin'"
2,Start somewhere else,"Cockburn is a brilliant artist; this is one of his weaker albums. There are too many spoken word pieces. He has made them taut and effective in the past (""Charity of Night,"" ""Birmingham Shadows"") but here they are limp, wan, unfinished-seeming--piles of words not turned into lyrics, musical backing not made into song. Blunt, unpleasant images abound, from the newborn baby sliding out of the nurse's hands in the opening track, to the judge and the hookers in ""Let the Bad Air Out."" The decent image in the ""Last Night of the World""--that all the singer would need is ""champagne and you""--is wasted in another half-baked song and track. The down-tempo ""Blueberry Hill"" is just depressing. Cockburn fans have all bought this anyway, but if you are new to him start with a masterpiece: ""The Charity of Night."" Then get the raucous live follow-up, ""You Pay Your Money and You Take Your Chance."""
3,"Competent, but not his best work","While it has his best ""single"" (always a relative term, considering Cockburn's usually complex song structure and rhythms) in years with ""Last Night of the World,"" much of the writing seems off-hand, lacking his usual lyric precision. Cockburn didn't spend much time on his melodies, and as a result, there is way too much of the ""spoken blues"" he has resorted to in the past few years. For anybody else, Breakfast would garner 4 or 5 stars, but for Cockburn, one of our premier songsmiths, it sounds like he's coasting and badly in need of inspiration. It's good to hear from Cockburn, but we're still awaiting his late-career masterpiece."
4,Not what you'd expect... but that's Bruce!,"Great alignment of musical vocals from Margo Timmins to Lucinda and others. Well crafted, planned, yet unexpected. Another Bruce top five CD."
5,It made me smile.,"The prodigous talent of Mr. Cockburn shines on each song. Each cut leaves a strong impression the lyrics are so evocative ""I've seen the flame of hope among the hopeless And that was truly the biggest heartbreak of all That was the straw that broke me open"" What else is there to say I love it. Buy this album."
4,A welcome addition to my collecton,"Very good album. On par with T-Bone Burnett's ""Criminal Under My Own Hat"" and Sam Philips ""Bikinis and Martinis""; hasn't hit me musically like either of U2 best albums, though. Appreciate his poetic lyrics and subtle use of silence (a welcome relief to so much in Western Culture). His album, like my favorite literature, reveals something new with each listen. I like it roughly as well as the other album of his I own ""Nothing But a Burning Light"". I admire the man and his work.His mother must be proud!"
2,Disappointingly poor quality textbook,"I purchased this text for a class taught by Joy Laskar at Georgia Tech. I was very dissapointed with the last of polish the book had. The author, Laskar, is very knowledgeable about his field, however the text he provides lacks most of the nuance you would expect from a textbook. Many portions read more like excerpts from published papers, complete with the lack of in depth examples and explainations, and while references are plentiful, it would be preferable for a student to have the example or worked out problems mentioned present in the text instead of located in a trade journal somewhere which one may or may not have access to.Additionally, the images throughout the book were horrible. Lacking color, and resized from orginals in a sloppy way, most are pixelated, grayscale, and difficult to use."
2,User friendly?,I've been wrestling with these CDs for about 2 months. No attempt to slow down the Russian speakers or break the words down by syllables to assist with pronouncing them right. I borrowed the Pimsleur Russian course and found it much more user-friendly for helping with pronunciation and more practical than trying to memorize word and phrase lists while driving.
2,need more material for developing reading skills,"Agreed with a few other reviewers: The course would be better if it would spend more time in the beginning with pronounciation and focus on reading drills. Slow and methodical at the beginning, rather than immediate immersion into dialogue."
5,The Wall,Pink Floyd's The Wall is a must have for any guitarists. This classic album never ceases to amaze me. Every second is a masterpiece.
1,100 Symbols,"I am sorry to report of my disapointment with this title. While it does contain some interesting research, the symbols illustrated are all modernized graphics. The use of traditional and historic depictions of the symbols would have made this work much more readable."
5,symbols,"This book has great explanations and meanings for almost every symbol you can think of. The explanations transcend through many cultures and religions to show you what things mean to different peoples. It talks about signs and symbols as well as the symbology of certain animals, plants, colors, numbers, etc. This book does not give many exapmples (pictures) of symbols, but that is not completely necessary for the purpose this book serves. This book is an amazing reference for artists in all mediums. I strongly recommend this book."
3,ADDITIONAL REFERENCE AS DICTIONARY,Impressive book because of its good contents. Will be good for children as means to learn the beauty of the art and symbols. Although the binding of the book is bad because of its thick individual pages. I hope publisher see to it that the pages are snug together. Thank you.
4,Borderline Infomercial but still good stuff,"I give the book four stars because I feel the advertisement about the nutrition center should have or could have been left out.However, like some folks said this information should be common sense I agree is should be but look around. Does your life style or the life style of your Christian friends show common sense? I believe most of us (not all because some folks are on the right track) can get some good from this or similar teaching about our physical health. And if we are physically healthy we will be better ambassadors for Christ. True, it is not going to be a cure all for everybody but the principals are good. The one big drawback that I see is being able to afford whole natural foods. Too many of us have to live in and work in environments that preclude natural food styles, but just like most of us don¡t fully live up to every precept of the Bible itself, it is still worth striving for. I would say prayerfully read the book."
5,good info is always a positive read,"I recommend this book because very few books actually try to explain why we are in poor health. Many people miss the point and buy into the mainstream generalizations of why so many of us are having some medical problems. I am not a religious person, but found his book a good read because I think he is on the right track. I thank him for his contribution. So what if he isn't considered a perfect writer like one of his critics noted."
2,Why Christians Get Sick,"I was disappointed with this book, as I thought it would be more specific. The information just wasn't put together like I thought it would be. An ""okay"" read, but not as good as I had hoped."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This book has some of the first Savage Dragon work, including the limited series, and some bits of the Megaton Man story.Dragon mysteriously appears in the city, and goes to work with the police force. He meets the co-workers that will become important parts of the story.A family conflict ends up with Dragon's girlfriend being killed by a hitman sent to bump him off. This sends him diving into a bottle."
1,A big laugh if you want a good story.,Image creators based their characters too much on Marvel or DC heroes.Savage Dragon really looks like the Hulk with a Fin on his head.
1,Accordian Tribe,"A friend once joked to me that the music in heaven is played on a harp, while music in hell is played on an accordian. At the time, I was offended because I've enjoyed accordian music since my childhood. After hearing this CD, I must agree with my friend. I consider listening to it a second time much worse than a trip to hades. I can't give it away for fear of losing a friend, and it lacks the aerodynamic qualities of a Frisbee. Perhaps I could send it to the earlier reviewer as a replacement for his CD after he wears it out from repeated playing?"
3,Teva Sandals,"This is a great shoe, but the closure is very difficult to open, and I have at least average dexterity in my fingers."
2,Lack of standards,"Teva Women's Kenetic Circuit SandalsPurchased these sandals because I was very satisfied with a previous pair. However, lack of standardization was soon apparent. The buckles on this pair are very difficult to open and lack of velcro make them impossible to adjust. Due to this difference in standards, I do not recommend buying them over the internet; go to a store to make sure they fit."
1,Do not buy these shoes!,I previously bought two pairs of these shoes. Then I made a mistake and bought a third pair. They had changed the shoes and it the new version has buckles that are basically impossible to use. I loved the previous ones for the ease and function of the velcro. They were great for walking now I can't even use these!
1,Sandals,I wasn't even able to get these shoes on my feet. I tried to adjust the strap and was able to loosen it enough to get my feet into them. This is the 2nd time I've order this brand of sandal and was unsuccessful in getting them on both times. I was impressed with the quality of the product but felt perhaps they were made for a very small Chinese foot. I had to return them both times and as a result will never order them again.
5,Tevea Women's Kenetic Circuit Sandals,"I'm a fan of Teva Sandals. I've had them before and appreciate the comfort they provide. I like the clip fasteners and the opportunity to adjust those straps. Good tread for taking on the trails. Built well which justifies the cost.Not a big choice of colors, but the colors provided was satisfactory. Get them wet? No problem. Try them, you'll be glad you did.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NW9QAK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img"
5,Buck Kalinga,I have this knife and it's older brother the original kalinga.I prefer the older one as the tang on the newer one sticks out the back of the handle and can be quite annoying unless you intend to hit someone in the head. Both are great knives and the older one I've had over 30 years and still holds a very sharp edge.
5,Great Knife,This knife is an all around good knife for hunting and farm chores. The balance is fantastic. It is quality unsurpassed.
2,Not what I thought it would Be,"I received the book in good condition, but it was completely different from the original book I purchased in the 80's. I thought it would be the same book but it was not. I guess they changed it for the better but I wasn't pleased with what I saw. I like the book I purchased originally. Having said that, however, I think this is a great book to learn how to save thousands on your mortgage and pay it off sooner. If more homeowners take the time to learn these strategies, there would have been no crisis."
2,Not much of a secret,"Here is what this book says. Paying your mortgage off faster than your payment schedule will save you tens of thousands of dollars. True, but what is the time value of that money you spent on your mortgage? Could you have ""made"" more in the stock market or somewhere else?Yet the author belabors the point ad nauseam, giving examples about how much you can save paying a little more per month.Basically, he does not give the full story. When you pay off your loan early, you are also paying a net higher interest rate. Scim this book at the bookstore. The best secret is not buying this book!"
3,Too many tables,"You really don't need this book to do this on your own. Just print out a mortgage amortization table. If you don't know how to do this, contact your mortgage company and ask them to send it to you. Next, look at your most recent mortgage statement and find your current/remaining balance. Find this number in the amortization table. If you can't find it exactly, find the number that is just greater than it. Now you know where you are in your loan and you can see how many more payments you have. By paying extra principal, you move down the table. The more you pay, the faster you move. That's the secret."
4,"Good, money-saving information","If you want to save money on your mortgage and actually know how much money you will save, this is the book for you. There are - I don't know how many - charts that show mortgage amount, interest rate, and interest paid. Use these charts to decide how much you can save over the life of your mortgage. Very worthwhile book."
2,Bankers have only 1 Secret?,"Disappointed, this book does discuss paying your mortgage off early and gives you the technique to accomplish that, but a whole book for this one technique? I wouldn't purchase it again, skim it at the bookstore. Discuss the method the book gives with your mortgage holder - some won't apply your money in the way the book notes. They don't have to, if you signed a paper at closing in which the bank stated a different method of applying your extra money. Remember that stack of papers you signed, look through them and see if there is one that shows how the bank will apply extra payments, even ones marked principle only."
1,Do not buy the audio tape of this book!!!,"I'm an avid audio tape listener and purchased the audio version of this book. It came in a generic case (like you'd buy to copy your own cassettes) with shabby wrapping and a couple of black and white stickers on it. It was so bad, I sent it back to Amazon. It may be worth $1.29, but not $12.95!!!"
5,"Hawk ""Black"" racing brake pads","These guys know their stuff. These brake pads always provide great brake feel and never fade, even under racing conditions. I would not use anything else!"

5,"We Watched, We Built & We Won!","This video is awesome. We had been raceing for a couple of years and losing badly...but after purchasing this video with the easy step by step instructions, my son and I built a winning car. Not only did we win our local race, but we blew them away at the district races also. I highly recommend this video to everyone who has to build a pinewood derby car. Your son will never forget it!"
2,Please Stop Punishing Me,"I've made it fairly deep into this book and it is filled with puns. The title claims Jokes first, haven't found one yet. Puns are not that funny. I should have downloaded the sample and tried that first."
5,SHOULD BE CALLED RAREST VICTOR DUETS!,Great stars doing Rare and enjoyable duets. EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND and you don't have to have the name Victor to enjoy these duets!
4,This is a very inspiring and educational book.,"This is a great book. Very informative and inspiring. It gives details and tips to enhance your technical experise, and your lover's pleasure. It has worked very well for me and I highly recommend it (especially for the price)."
2,haayyyyyyyted it!,"okay maybe that is a little harsh, but i was not inspired to read this book. i thik the best part about it was the advise on doing pelvic floor exercises.How to Be a Great Lover: Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Time-Tested Techniques That Will Blow His Mindis a MUCH better book infact it's great."
5,Wonderful,"I received this book for my first marriage and what a help this was!! It is a wonderful book for those that are still ""virgins"" and don't want to ask anyone just ""How to Make Love to A Man"". Alexandra Penney writes this in a very nice and understanding way."
3,Pretty Good,"Honestly I was expecting a few more pointers and tips and less of a lecture. What I read was good, I just wanted more.I would recommend 500 Lovemaking Tip by Michael Webb which gave a lot of fun techniques and interesting things you can do to spice things up."
3,Okay,"This book was okay, but is very slow reading. I was looking for a book by the same title that a friend of mine told me about and this was not the book that I was expecting."
3,"Common Sense, But It's Still Worth Reading.","I recommend this to my customers who have read my book. There is a lot of common sense in here (things you already know and do), but there are also ideas and quick tips that you may have never even tried, or heard of before. The more you know, the better, more imaginative lover you are for your mate! This should be part of your library, under: ""HOT SEX!""

4,a stuart kaminsky mystery with Peter Lorre,"this looks to be an other good read of mysteries by Kaminsky. i am a fan of Peter Lorre and this will be my third mystery with him in the cast. George Baxt wrote one the Greta Garbo Murder Mystery and Lorre is amoung the people she is involved with, and there is another Kaminsky book i think that i don't have yet. Baxt so far is my favorite writer of old Hollywood mysteries but Kaminsky carries the tradition on with some nice stories too."
3,Toby Peters meets Peter Lorie,"What would you do if your best friend called to say his wife has run away with the tough guy actor Peter Lorie? Toby Peters can't let Sheldon Minck down in the 13th of the series with THINK FAST, MR. PETERS.Good mystery with sharp dialogue and great characters, but for some reason this one falls a little flat as if Mr. Kaminsky is trying a little too hard and can't quite bring it off.If you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy THINK FAST, MR. PETERS.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
5,The best of the best.,"I have been using this camcorder for about a week now andall I can say is WOW.If you are looking for great video, pictures, and small size, then this is for you.I could go into a long and boring review, but who will read it.Just buy it if you want beautiful movies."
2,This is Not Rod speaking!!!,"This is not Rod McKuen reading these poems! He even says so in the Insert-it is a good friend-name doesn't matter! Sorry, but I want the version I had on Vinyl with Rod's sexy scratchy whiskey voice!"
3,Nothing short of Divine........,"This is one of the most romantic discs. His voice, the music, the sound effects all blends together to turn you on if you are with someone speecial or make you relax if alone. Definitely a 'must have' for the true romantic."
5,A Must-Have for everyone,"As each person is born, they should be ""issued"" a copy of this CD...and the world would be a better place...filled with happy, peaceful people! I've given this CD so many times that I wish I could buy it in bulk and get a discount. Makes a WONDERFUL wedding or engagement present."
2,HAVE ORIGINAL RECORD,I HAVE THE ORIGINAL 33 LP RECORD. This does'nt sound anything like this. The voice is too smooth for Rod .
5,"Let ""THE SEA"" sweep you away!","""THE SEA"" is a timeless, beautifully arranged convergence of Rod McKuen's words, Anita Kerr's musical compositions, and the uncomparable talents of the San Sebastian Strings. If ever there was an album that lifted the heart and soul, this is it. ""Gifts from the Sea"", is romantic. ""Pushing the Clouds Away"" touches upon our frailties; while ""The Storm"", a masterpiece in and of itself, explores our vulnerabilities. ""The Ever Constant Sea"", is a soothing instrumental; while ""The Gypsy Camp"" is delightfully playful. The title cut, ""The Sea"" concludes the album. With the sounds of the sea accompanying each orchestration, Mother Nature never sounded so soothing. Let ""THE SEA"" sweep you away!"
5,No Words Can Express The Beauty Of These Recordings!,"As others I discovered ""The Earth, The Sky, And The Sea,"" in the late 60's - wore the reel to reel out, the records, the tapes - and there has been nothing like Rod McKuen's ""The Earth"" and ""The Sea"", PLEASE REPRODUCE THIS IMMORTAL SET AGAIN, its beauty is priceless...I'm ready to buy!"
5,nostalgia,This album was something from my young days and it was a special memory. I have tried to find it for years but it has just now come out.It is still a relaxing and amazing listen. Rod McKuens voice is always has amazed me.
5,The Sea,"As many of the other reviewers, I was a teenager when I first bought, The Sea. I was young and goofy and in love. I married my love and we have been married 40 years. I also owned, The Earth and The Sky and In Search of Eros, and I loved them all. My favorite is The Storm on The Sea Album. Unfortunately, I let a friend borrow all of the albums and never got them back, so I am so happy to find The Sea here. I just wish that I could get The Earth and The Sky!!!! I love The Earth!!! I have loved Rod McKuen all these years, and these albums will remain within me forever."
5,The best calming music ever...,"This has been my favorite recording since 1969 and I thought I had gone to heaven when I found it on CD. This is a great CD - if you have any romance in your heart, you will find this music the best investment ever. It is all excellent, one cannot pick a favorite. Definitely a must have....."
2,"Wonderful, timeless beauty. Savor like a fine wine.","I've owned the LP for 25 yrs. it's one of my most cherished albums. Beyond categories, reflective, romantic, soul stirring, new age (before New Age was a category). It was incredible when I first heard it and even more so with maturity. A real find."
3,very misleading,"I loved Rod McKuen as a teenager/young adult. The only album of the famous trilogy that I owned was ""The Earth"", which I played over and over until it wore out. Unfortunately, for some strange reason ""The Earth"" was never made into a CD, so I thought I would try ""The Sea"". The poety is fine, but there is one BIG problem. Rod McKuen is NOT even speaking the lines, not reciting his own work, like he did on ""The Earth"" album. The liner notes say ""a friend"" is speaking. This was a HUGE disappointment, so if you are like me and really enjoyed Rod's scratchy, whispering, seductive voice as much as the material itself, be forewarned...you will be very let down!!"
5,Still hits me in the heart.,"It was, of course, the melding of Anita Kerr's music with Rod McKuen's poetry that made these albums special. It is still as wonderful as it was then. The music is some of the most peaceful and meaningful music I've ever heard, even after almost 40 years. Maybe the poems aren't as profound as we thought when we first heard these recordings of The Sea, The Earth and The Sky, but they still hit in the heart and that's what it's all about anyway.I do wish The Earth and The Sky were also available on CD."
3,Not The Best,I am a big Indy Car racing fan and watched Roger Ward race. The book chronicles his career but it seems to forget a lot of his life and the other drivers of the that era. It seems to be more of a photo book.
5,Roger Ward 3-time Indy winner,"Excellent book on American midget and champ car racing in America in the 50's and 60""s"
4,captured the era,Captured a time lost with interesting discriptions of a different and more romantic era in racing. Not very interested in race by race discriptions. Very good book overall. Worth buying if your a history buff.
5,Very rewarding and educational,I really enjoyed this book. I had to do a special project on aromatherapy and I used this book as one of the 5 books that I had to read. It was easy to read and enjoyable and had alot of information on pregnancy and childbearing. I would recommend this book highly. This is a book that I will go back to over and over
1,Haven't we heard this story before?,"it seems that as long as reguritate the dominate social narrative of an oppressed/underpresented group the work is considered a ""masterpiece"" and ""touching"". Well this left me cold. How many times does this novel need to be written? there are many ways to create unforgettable characters and working the hell out of tired stereotypes is not one of them.Also, read something by Julius Lester if you want to see this kind of thing done well."
3,Slow at first,"As an adult (34 years old) reading this book for a teen book club that I started in my subdivision, I found the book to be a bit slow at first. However, half way through the book, it grabbed my attention as the main character, LaVaughn, begins to analyze herself and the people around her. I ended up really enjoying the book. I believe that it would have inspired me if I had read it whilst a teen. It gave you a sense of hope as you hurt and heal with the characters. I smiled, I cried and I even gasped as the book took an unexpected turn. So many true lessons shared in this book. I could relate to some of what LaVaughn went through especially trying to grasp and understand the whole concept of God and church. I think teens from 12-15 would enjoy this book."
3,published elsewere,"Again, no new stories here. The same depressing everything goes wrong tails. All of these have been published elsewhere, in some cases many times over."
1,Do not ever buy from these people,Do not ever buy from these people. I had a problem with my purchase. I left them 5 messages to buying partners and never heard back from them. Amazon is not helping me to resolve the issue either.
3,Watch out for the re-recordings,"I bought this CD for the songs from Dick's ""Checkered flag"" album, his 1964 Capitol recording, that are not on some of the other Dick Dale compilations. There are a lot of great songs on this album, but I want to warn people that some of the songs on this CD are not the originals (Misirlou, The Victor, Surf Beat, Mr. Peppermint Man, The Wedge, Let's Go Trippin', King Of The Surf Guitar), but are re-recordings from the GNP Crescendo sessions produced by Jim Pewter in 1975. These re-recordings are OK, but they do not have the energy that the originals found on other compilations have. Jim Pewter himself wrote ""Those Memories Of You"" and this is probably the worst song on the CD. There are also some songs with vocals, mostly from the ""Checkered flag"" album. One of the songs recorded at the GNP Crescendo sessions, ""Peter Gunn,"" is really good."
3,Wesley and his mech (i'm 12),"This set is pretty cool. It has all sorts of neat-o parts and the martian. You gotta have the martian! I like all the sand red and slope peices. Go to brickshelf.com and you'll get a lotta bad reviews about this set, but i really like it. I like how the legs actually have knees, unlike set#7313. Well, I think it looks like knees. at least they're not flat, right?"
2,Read Flash Cards and fail the CCDA Exam,I will certainly not agree with the above reviewer. Falsh Cards do not cover any design examples. In fact the summary provided at the end of CCDA official study guide is much more than these flash cards.I would not recommend flash cards as the only study material for CCDA Exam. In fact you will require to study the official second editon of the CCDA study Guide to pass the CCDA Exam.
4,Solid study reference,"This book provides a very good study aid before you take your CCDA exam...I was a little confused at one of the above reviews stating ""Use these and fail your CCDA exam"" until I clicked on all the reviews sent by that reader - it seems he/she has a history of failing the exams and blaming the book. As I said, this book provides a great study AID, it's not meant to be your ONLY study resource for the CCDA exam!"
1,Probably outdated in 2010... CCDP 642-873,"Looking for some information on prep materials for the CCDP, and anyone looking at this material has to realize ahead of time that the test has been updated since this material was first made available.The most recent exam is the CCDP (ARCH) 642-873 and this set may (or may not) be able to prepare you for the new exam. The old exam is retired,so I'm a bit surprised this is still for sale.[...]"
3,Useful but PDA users beware,"All in all I found this to be a good supplement to my other CCDA study material. It particularly was useful to skim though the cards prior to reading that topic (from another source) and then really quizzing yourself after finishing the chapter.The quiz engine had a few mistakes but overall I found it quite useful.However, when I installed the flash cards on my Sony Clie TH-55 it caused a fatal memory error that required a hard reset! It was a painful loss of data! After sending my clie back to Sony, they certified it OK, and when I tried to install the cards (a 2nd and 3rd time) it crashed again! Acckk!! I'm sure this is not common but back up your PDA before installing it!!!I rate it 3 stars only because I bought it so I could study on the train with my PDA, and sadly cannot do so. (would be a 4 otherwise)"
2,Good primer but illustrations badly reproduced,"I had been trying to get this book for years and was excited when it was finally in-stock. To my dismay, all the original artwork illustrations were badly reproduced and in a yellowish tinge therefore rendering any references to uniform colors totally pointless. As Osprey Publishing's key attraction is their excellent illustrations, this reprinted edition drops below their usual high QC standards.However, this book serves as a good overview primer to understanding the French Army's experience in Vietnam."
3,this record deserves more than a cut-out bin grave !!!!,"i picked this record up in the early 90's for a mere 99 cents at NRM . this album has already outlived NRM so hah hah !!!! . i bought it cuz the cover was hilarious in that glam-rock way . David Drew has a fringe leather jacket , a peace sign on his shirt , and an ammo belt to balance out the peace sign .huge hair . i would listen to it here & there because i thought it absurd ,,,,, but over time i grew to genuinely enjoy the album . the production and lyrics are not always to my liking , but are indicative of that L.A. rock era . the only throw-away track in my opinion is the cover of ""green-eyed lady"" . if this same album was released by an artist with a bigger name( at the time) , i believe it would have yielded some hit singles . especially BILLY IDOL . i have since aquired three mint condition copies of this on vinyl . worth a listen .where are you David Drew ? holler at a fan ."
5,CONCISELY,"First and major portion of book covering Pearl Harbor is excellent. However, after Layton's death, the book was continued from his notes and descriptions of campaigns after Pearl Harbor suffer in quality by comparison."
1,Use Photoshop or Elements? Use a Mac? Then you can't use this.,"If1. You have a >6MP camera OR2. You shoot RAW OR3. You save your jpegs out of Photoshop or Elements OR4. You use a MacintoshThen you can't use this frame. The manual lists requirements 1 and 2 under ""troubleshooting"". Requirements 3 and 4 are hidden on the web.(The manual also doesn't tell you what the menu setup options do, like ""phase"")It will display only:unedited jpeg files directly out of a 6MP or less camera.files written by the free Windows-only Optipix software (well, it claims to, but since I have a Macintosh, I can't verify this.)The manual lists the resolution as 960X234 dots, but they're apparently counting the R, G, and B pixels separately -- the resolution is 320 X 230, which explains why the images are so fuzzy.There are much better frames out there."
1,Digital Frame,"The digital frame was nice looking, but it didn't function as advertised. I couldn't get the pictures to come up in the format or number that the instructions indicated. Also, the quality of the photos shown wasn't very good, even when I used higher resolution photos. Also, got somewhat of a run around when I tried to return the unit. It was a Christmas present and was purchased online in November. By the time Christmas came, the return period had passed. However, the company finally came to their senses and refunded my money."
5,really cool,I love the sounds of the frogs. My granddaughter loves to play them over and over. knowing which frog is churping or whatever you call that sound is really cool
1,don't buy the clock!,"These cards might work fine if the clock worked properly and was of better quality. It is cheap and broke within a few months entirely. The cards wouldn't play sounds as selected, but would run through all sounds (until it broke entirely) when the alarm was set. If you can find a better clock that these would work on, then give it a shot. I emailed the company (even the email didn't work properly on their site!) but never heard back from them."
2,Troy: Giving Teenagers a Bad Name,"Contrary to popular belief, most people buy books about Troy to read (no kidding!) about Troy! Never would have guessed, would you?This book (a bestseller ENTITLED Troy), however, is determined to add something more:TEENAGERS AND THEIR SORDID LOVE LIVES!While the battle rages outside Troy's walls, the two protagonists, sisters Marpessa and Xanthe, obsess, cry, yell, and catfight over a boy (beautiful Alastor who spent all of five seconds in battle before getting wounded)!Instead of a fierce ten-year battleground, the city of Troy becomes an attractive backdrop for a teenage soap opera. And instead of the epic this tale should have been, readers are left with girl fights, premarital sex, and (of course) unwanted pregnancies!Might as well watch it on TV!"
2,School Project,"This was an English project, so my review of it is based on the fact that this is not the genre I would choose to read on my own."
2,Eeehhh....,"This book wasn't all that good. One of it's main failings is that it is written largely from civilian perspective. If you're interested in reading a not that exciting book about how terrible the Trojan's women's side of the war was, then this is the book for you. Another way of saying it is that this version of Troy is a good one for the ladies. there is practically no actual conflict and an excess of passion. the narrative is largely from girl's point of view, and the actual Trojan war is mostly in the background, with a few of it's key elements thrown in to keep the story going. this is definitely not a cross gender book. On the other hand, Adele's way of including the gods was interesting, but not worth reading the book."
5,Bets book about troy so far,"I started reading this book thinking it would be like another book, Inside the Walls of Troy, which is told by Cassandra and Helen instead of those who are rarely mentioned in any of the stories about troy, and most of them exist inside this book and this book only. This book is told from several points of view: Polyxena ( not the princess ), Iason, Alastor, and the two major players in the book, Marpessa and Xanthe. Familiar fces, whether gods or mortals, also show up: Astyanax (the part where he dies is the only part I don't read anymore), Hector, Priam, Hecuba, Paris, Deiphobus, Ares, Aphrodite,Artemis, Poseiden, Apollo,Laocoon, Andromache, Helen, Cassandra, and Achilles. I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to read about troy."
3,Troy By Adele Geras,"The blurb on the back of the book says: the Grimmest of wars is about to get worst. Maybe it is because of the plot. Don't get me wrong. I love Adele Geras' writing. She incorporates all of the gods and has very interesting characters, and tells the story of the wonderful Iliad at the same time. But some of the characters are not very believable, and repetitive. For instance, one of the main characters can see the gods, but she blames everything on them and seems to have no conscience whatsoever. She thinks she can do whatever she wants. Secondly, the gods show up throughout the book, giving away what will happen later on, but then everyone just forgets about them over 30 times through the book. It gets very boring, and you become detached with everyone, because you know that something is going to happen to them in the end. Besides this, though, it is a very entertaining novel, and should be read."
2,A Mediocre retelling of the Illiad,"I hate to go against the barrage of praise for Geras's Troy, but I found it to be somewhat disappointing despite all the nice quotes on the jacket. As a novel, and even as a young adult novel, I feel that there is more than can be reaped from the tale than just a recital of the facts of the Trojan war and a somewhat one-dimensional love story. The pivotal points of the story have been reduced to one or two sentences, the most lengthy being only a paragraph. It seemed a little bit like a Cliff's notes with some extra adjectives thrown in. Although I have to admit the book was sometimes a pageturner when it came to the soap opera like story of the sisters, I can say that the depiction of the war could have been done better."
1,Timex = junk,"I too bought 2 of the 60 minute timers. In less than a year one failed completely, won't set. Took it apart and found tiny plastic gear with no teeth. There is no way these things are going to last, built in China by the low bidder. Junk, don't waste your money."
1,Glad I am not the only one.,I downloaded this book after reading the rave 5 Star reviews. Sadly I should have read the 2 and 1 star reviews. They have all said it better than I could. The book is plodding and not very well paced. The universe it inhabits is poorly explained and confusing more times than not. Its also hard to keep up with as the author switches focus on a dime before the reader can get an idea of what is going on. Save yourself the time and read something else.
3,"Starts strong, but riddled with flaws","Conceptually interesting, even fascinating at times, and sufficient to keep me reading and hoping for greatness. The conclusion is rushed, and too many ideas are not satisfactorily explained. I can usually accept weakly-drawn characters in service to great ideas (as with Asimov), and this starts out feeling like such a book. However, without more details, more ""hard science,"" the ideas feel like shallow hooks, especially without any characters to back them up. Also, a number of plot threads were left dangling, making for a waste of space and time.EDIT: After a light skim, and reading quite a bit of other SFF in the few years since I read this, I'm bumping it up a star. My overall conclusion is unchanged, but the ideas here are really extraordinary, and worth a look. I just wish that Vinge was a stronger novelist."
3,The book doesn't live up to hype (for me at least),This is no page turner for me. I put it down easily several times. A marginal read.
2,How did it win the Hugo?,"What did I miss? This is just a below average SF book, easy to put down. But I finished it because I want to read all the HUGO winners. I gave it 2 stars because the ""networked packs"" and the children were interesting; otherwise, reading this was a chore. If I recall correctly, this tied for the 1993 HUGO with Connie Willis' ""Doomsday Book""--a much, much better book!"
5,This is the Best Sci-Fi Book Ever Written,Vernor Vinge is a genius. A Fire Upon the Deep is the best work of fiction that I have ever read. I've re-read this book at least 10 times. Its 613 pages is a 613 course gourmet meal for the mind.
2,Avoid the Kindle Edition,"The story makes for a fine read, but the Kindle edition is utterly trashed. Someone had the bright idea to add 1,522 ""Notes"" that litter the text with the aesthetic appeal of thousands of plastic grocery bags blowing around Yosemite. If I wanted a book with someone else's (even the author's) highlights and notes, I would have gone to the used book store."
4,Slow to start but a great story in total,"A 600 plus page novel is expected to lay a lot of narrative down to start but I was still waiting for the plot to pick up tempo at page 200. I was pleasantly surprised by the two main alien races' unique presentation though I was really hoping the Blight would have had more development and ""screen time"". Perhaps the transcendant nature of the powers was vague by design. Regardless, by the end of the book the action was fully flowing and the scope of potential outcome was still wide open so the reader could enjoy the suspense."
3,Good but flawed!,"This is a very uneven book. Vinge writes well. He is at his best when he describes the world of Tines. A world where individuals are compound organisms. These sections read almost as well as Richard Adams's ""Watership Down."" On the other hand, his humans are underdeveloped. They lack personality and are hard to empathize with. However the biggest flaw, of the otherwise enjoyable book, is the resolution. Deus ex machina is a completely unacceptable literary device. In my opinion it is always a fatal flaw in any book."
3,Kindle versions disappointing,"The story seems wonderful, and there are many other reviews about that, so this is just a comment on the two Kindle versions currently available. The one that says ""Special Edition eBook"" in the title contains links to notes all through the text. The links are somewhat distracting (although you eventually learn to ignore them), and the notes don't really add any value, at least not to me. However, this is still the version I recommend because the other one (not the Special Edition) does not honor your font size preferences and it seems to be completely pre-formatted, with unnecessarily large margins and some sections of text (written messages, etc.) that are too small to see. Hopefully this review will keep you from purchasing both versions just to decide which one you want. Go with the Special Edition and learn to mentally filter out the links to the notes."
5,"Fascinating ideas, and original speculations","Usually, for me to love a book, it has to grab my interest and hold it for multi-hour long stretches at a time. This book, however, has won my heart a little differently. I again and again had to put it down just to ponder Vinge's quite original (as far as I know) view of the galaxy. Toss in some really unique aliens, and you've got a bunch of mind-blowing, quality reading.It is a tad long, the plot is only OK, and the characters are sometimes a little flat, but the speculative factors make up for these weaknesses and more (there's a reason it won the Hugo award). If you're up for a mind-job, I recommend this book. If you're up for a thriller, grab something else."
3,Okay... but a Hugo?,"By its nature, science fiction requires the audience to suspend their belief. But there is a difference between suspending it and hanging it. This book, unfortunately, requires the latter. Major components of the story (the terrible galactic menace, for example) are never really well explained, and many of the characters - especially the humans - are flat two-dimensional personalities that potentially could have given the reader more, but finally left this reader wondering ""whyfore a Hugo?"". In fact, the two primary adult human characters (Pham and Ravna) had lost so much credibility that - by the end of the book - I thought it seemed more like an episode of ""I Love Lucy in Space"".But there are many good ideas in the book. Most of the alien cultures where quite interesting - even unique. And Vinge's physics of the galaxy are wonderful. It's just unfortunate that story doesn't showcase these things better."
2,100 Words or Less,"I loved the opening chapter ... and then came the doglike telepathic symbiotic warriors?Ugh. I suppose those aliens are as good as any, but from that chapter I knew exactly where this novel was heading. Okay, maybe I didn't know exactly, but it was enough of a disappointment for me to stop reading.I just have no patience for the ""children among aliens"" plot devices."
1,Awful and boring,"I bought A fire Upon The Deep when it first came out in the UK - circa 1992. In the intervening nine years I have tried to get past page 20 about six times. On each occasion I have failed - primarily becuase I couldn't follow what was going on. Vinge switches focus so often, and with such abruptness, that the reader is left wondering if this book was written for the author's own amusement, rather than the enjoyment of the paying audience. I'm sure that the legion of Vinge-lovers will hate me for disliking AFUTD and will probably try to claim that I'm a bit thick. Duhhhh! Good night children."
4,Pretty Good Book,"I don't remember why I picked up this book in my library...but I did...and it was certainly worth it. The characters are well drawn...and the Skroderiders and Tines are great aliens. In fact, the Tines are the reason I gave this book four stars instead of five...I found them extremely engrossing, so engrossing that when Vinge switches to his human characters I didn't seem to enjoy it as much...also, with the human characters Vinge shows his training as a computer scientist...he tends to focus a bit much on computer systems in the ""human world"". This doesn't mean the ""human stuff"" isn't good, it really is...Pham Nuwen is a great character, full of depth and well...character (which is probably why Vinge uses him in the prequel, A Deepness in the Sky). Overall, the book is definitely worth reading...and the prequel is even better."
4,Great Treat (but I am still trying to figure the title out),"I was up until 1:00 in the morning finishing this book. So many fascinating concepts, so little room here to discuss them. I am still captivated by Vinge's ""pack mind"" concept-- not to mention some of his other concepts regarding other forms of sentience. And that he could make captivating characters out of his unusual sentients was a wonderful trick.This was the first book of Vinge's that I'd read, and if (as another reviewer noted) it is not the best introduction to his work, I am really excited about getting my hands on his other stuff."
4,Vision vision vision,"There comes a mind with an original idea occasionally. This guy has more than a few. I love his idea that the laws of physics are in themselves somehow tied up with gravity, which sort of folds relativity in on itself. His views of the nature of intelligence as transcending the physical bounds of the individual are manifested in several contrasting ""entities"": the Tine packs, the ""normal"" civilisations and the Higher Order beings of the Beyond, which draws religious thinking of Good and Evil into the universe in a natural way. I love this universe. And they use a FTL version of the Internet! How do I subscribe?"
5,Genuinely Interesting,"I usually don't read fiction books, but I greatly enjoyed this yarn. The book is interesting Science Fiction. The alien races are genuinely different, and it's intriguing to read how their mind works.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in Science Fiction."
2,Potential...,"It started out so great, but it was the worst ending of any science fiction book I have ever read. Can't really recommend it; there were good parts though..."
2,"Everyone else is ga-ga, calls it a classic. I don't see it.","I had had this book suggested so many times. So when I finally got around to reading it, I was set up for disappointment and didn't finish it, not enjoying it at all. So when I came back to it much later and decided to give it another chance, I hoped for a turnaround. Not to be. Vinge is a smart smart guy, and clever. He builds some great threads into this book, which has been aptly described as space opera. I was looking for more of a philosophical bent, I guess. It's not that I wanted the book to be more serious - - I just kept getting the feeling that Vinge's tendencies for fairly traditional SF space-y tropes don't fit my liking. This didn't live up in the face of the likes of Bester or Haldeman (or even Heinlein, yikes), which is where I'd turn if I were you."
1,Fire Fizzles,"Some of the subject matter and ideas, especially pack-consciousness and gradient zones of galactic consciousness, have real intrinsic appeal, but the development here is unfocused and cobbled, and eventually, after a long long, take your potted plant for a walk, long time, fizzles with a whimper.Hugo or nogo, ""Fire"" reads like a careless and bloated first draft: way too much undramatized exposition, i.e. telling about what the characters are thinking and doing and feeling, telling about every thing that's happened elsewhere and else when, even on occasion witlessly telling what is going to happen; sliced onion plot layers--all tears no taco; a perfunctory ooze of sentimentality which slathers further insult on the redundant, extraneous, cliched characters. And, by Yoda's grizzled jowls, turning telepathic puppies and sentient shrubbery into tiresome house guests is...well it shouldn't be done.If you're not primarily a sci-fi fan, you may find a modicum of arsenic to be more efficacious."
4,Good blending of Hard SF and Space Opera,"Vinge does the impossible and creates a novel that blends Hard SF with Space Opera and Science Fatansy. The result is closer to the latter than the former, but AFUTD has a sense of pluasibility that makes it more engrossing than your typical space opera.Not a perfect book, it gets a little slow in the second half, but certainly a very good one."
5,"Excellent, Thought Provoking","Excellent, Thought ProvokingI don't have time to write an in depth review, but this book deserved a recommendation, so I will be direct and brief.The base premises such as the ""slow zone"" that make this book different are excellent. The writing style is good, characterization and descriptions are good. The only possible downside to this book is an assumption by the author that the reader is capable of doing a little mental work while reading. This is not your passive, MTV story. There are gaps and leaps that you will have to work at. I find that a valuable part of the read.I expect that many of the people that reviewed this book poorly just don't have the mental guns to keep up with the story. Something simple like Eragon would be more appropriate for them.This is classic, hard Sci-Fi well done.It is not as great or sweeping as Dune, not as spectacular as Stranger in a Strange Land, but it is as good as Ring World.Highly Recommended."
5,One of the best sci-fi books ever,"I love this book. I tend to like ""space opera""-type books and this is probably the best of those I've ever read. There are more big ideas in this book than almost any other (apart from maybe Neal Stephenson's work) and the writing is great. I was really riveted. An award-winner and for good reason."
3,"Good, Not Great. Poor Ending","I thought some of the ideas presented in this wildly creative book -- ""pack minds"" or single high-grade conciousnesses built out of multiple lower-grade consciousnesses -- to be highly intriguing. Yet at the same time the plot was convoluted with quick plot solutions at many points that were all too glaringly not well woven into the story: almost like the writer painted himself into numerous plot corners and then had to bail out with obvious devices. The ending was weak, hurried and unsatisfying. Some of the massive events he relates, such as the murder of billions of souls and the crushing of countless civilizations, are skimmed over quickly and hardly get the gravitas they deserve -- and yet one must at the same time be glad for that as the book is overly long and I found myself skipping pages."
2,Technobabble,"Good ideas, very interesting storyline and attractive protagonists.However, so much convoluted technobabble, it made the book next to impossible to read. Pity."
2,Not that exciting,"This book had interesting potential, but it failed early on. The character development was laborious and in the end, I really didn't care too much about anyone. The idea of physics as being mutable over distance does not correspond well with the hard-science misnomer given to this story. At some points, it almost seemed that the author was giving grandiose explanations that really explained nothing. I don't know if the author was trying to inspire thoughtful reflection on possibilities or wax poetic. Either way, it is a miss.The idea of the Tines was probably the best aspect. Group thought and individual interaction on that level is quite interesting, but nothing to hang a story on.If you want hard science/action, try David Weber. If you want philosophy, go to Dune."
2,How Did This Win An Award ???,"I cannot believe this book is as bad as I thought it was (see all the positive reviews). (Are people reluctant to write bad reviews?) But I felt it read like a first draft of meaningless meandering. The style is just the opposite of the likes of Asimov and Heinlein (and the stylistic Orson Scott Card). I finished about 1/3 of the book, was very disappointed, and traded it away."
1,Doggy fantasy of court intrugue and... oh yeah... that power thing.,"I read about a third of this before I returned it for a refund. This was more fantasy than SF and excruciatingly boring fantasy at that. There was no one I cared about in the entire novel, so why read it?"
5,A masterwork of space and time,"Vernor Vinge's book ranks among the best books I have ever read, not just science fiction. He has taken the wonders of today in computer science and space travel and fast forwarded them into a universe richer, smarter and far more diverse than many writers, let alone readers, can begin to imagine. Highly recommended."
3,Kindle edition is frustrating,"The Kindle edition is littered with ""Notes"" and links to them. They became increasingly distracting the more I read. This is the first time I really wished I had purchased the actual book instead of the digital version."
1,Embedded notes make it unreadable for me.,"Great book completely ruined with the damn ""NOTE #"" links on nearly every page, in large font, right in the middle. Whoever thought this was a good idea is a complete moron. The notes themselves are quite meaningless for the most part and detract from any reading pleasure."
5,Spectacular,"Vernor Vinge's stories operate on many levels, all of which are enjoyable. At its core, this book is an epic space opera. The plot is great, and the character development is some of the best I've ever encountered. Vinge's books also explore fascinating ideas in a far future setting, many of which are informed by his former life as a computer science professor at San Diego State University. Perhaps the most compelling thing about this book is the humanist depiction of alien species. Very few authors I've read have explored the ethics, sociology, and moral conscience that comprise the human soul in such a compelling manner. What makes it more interesting is that the most ""human"" characters in Vinge's stories are members of alien species.Highly recommended."
4,A book of 2 tales,"Two stories:1) The children on the Tines world - excelllent, original ideas about alien intelligence .. 5*s.2) The space race to stop the blight - seemingly, purposely confusing and an average storyline .. 3*s.A little disappointed with the ending. Too many things remained unexplained, for example several references to the fungus inside the spacecraft which never played any part in the plot that I could tell.The device that destroys the blight, is revealed only in the last chapter and not really explained - it's like the author just ran out of ideas and decided to kill the story.OTOH the doggies (Tines) are excellent and well thought out. I would like to have seen more effort spent on developing the story of the children and less on 'the net' which is just an interstellar usenet and not very original, even in 1994."
3,The story itself was a lot less than a sum of its parts.,"Despite some of the most vividly realised concepts I've ever come across in an SF novel, this book failed to satisfy me. The aliens are original, realistic, well thought out and used to good effect. The backdrop of a galaxy with different zones of consciousness is fresh and fascinating. The sequences concerned with the interaction between such zones is well executed. Yet against such a high-concept backdrop the internet-like text-only communication network seemed incongruous and old fashioned; the central characters failed to make me care for them and the ending of the book was a real anticlimax. After so many pages I had expected something spectacular. I'd planned to read the prequel ""A Deepness in the Sky"", but at 800 odd pages it'll probably suffer from the same problems."
3,Decent Space Opera,"My estimation of Fire upon the Deep may be somewhat inflated--I read the not-altogether-enjoyable Hyperion soon thereafter and to compensate, I probably have improved my rating of FUTD. Contrary to a number of reviews, FUTD is not hard science fiction: many of the ideas, like the audio ""thought"" of the Tines and the division of the galaxy into ""zones of thought"", are ridiculous (oh, alright, incredibly implausible), however well thought out the consequences might be. However, if you can suspend your disbelief, the story is told fairly well. It's not mind-blowing and I don't know why it won a Hugo, but it's decent."
2,How Did This Win A Hugo ?,"I am a big fan of Asimov and Card, so I thought I would enjoy this book based on the recomendations. This book read like a draft and I felt as though the writer was ineffective in 'telling the story' without straying too much. It is worth a try (some people love the book), but I did not find the book enjoyble or interesting at all."
3,Unique & commonplace mixed in a pretentious way,"There are some unique concepts but when mixed with the commonplace, I found it to be a bit pretentious. Undefined words & unpronounceable names, yet things still revolve around 24 hour days or light years, etc. Very earthly concepts used with very different non-earth lifeforms. Why write a book with so many complications and different concepts yet constantly refer back to the the mundane. I had trouble with it. And then the climax ended up a somewhat muted event. Perhaps a Glossary would have helped for those made up words/concepts. If that Glossary were accessible thru Kindle Touch word highlighting, would have made the book a little more enjoyable. YMMV."
3,What happened to the Blight?,"I started reading this book thinking it was going to be beyond amazing. We start out hearing about the emerging Blight in the first person and after that, nothing. I wanted to have some more insights from the Blight's point of view.I enjoyed the packs until about half way through then they got annoying. I wished that Steele had eaten the boy. I enjoyed the concept of Powers and zones. It would have been nice to have more on the Powers.I did not like the Riders at all and I found the trip from RIP to TineWorld excruciatingly long and boring.I give this book 5/5 until they get to RIP. After that, 2/5."
3,OK for a long plane trip,"Has a few neat ideas: galactic zones, wolf-pack aliens, evil computers;Starts strong, builds up, but then lets down. Had much potential, butcouldn't pull it off to be a great work."
2,"Good story, ""notes"" ruin the Kindle edition","A very good story, mostly ruined by bizarre embedded ""notes"" by the author. The notes are almost universally uninteresting and completely disrupt the flow of reading the book. While I can strongly recommend the story, the Kindle version is to be avoided."
5,Great book,"I found this to be a really great book. I always enjoy it when an author has a lot to say, wants to develop the characters, and wants an complicated plot and doesn't try to cram the whole thing into 250 pages. This book almost seems too short at its length.That being said, the character development is outstanding, the plot is original and Vinge does a very good job of keeping several stories going at the same time until they intertwine.I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,"Compelling Story, Bad Aliens, Bad Ending","The major characters in this book include 2 children, a pair of space traveling plants, and intelligent dogs who inhabit a medieval planet. The plot has potential but may let you down in the end. The universe the author creates is memorable, but talking plants and dogs are not what I look for in a Sci-Fi novel."
3,Good book a bit lagging (avoid kindle version),"The book is quite well written, interesting concept, and has some twists and turns which make it enjoyable.The kindle version appears to be very disorganized, with NOTEs sticking in the middle of the pages making the reading a lot harder with these notes creating a big distraction.The book could have been 75% of its original length, as at times it looks like the author made an effort to write 20-30 pages where nothing happens, or repeat something again which he just stated, or described a few pages ago.The end itself is quite abrupt, ends in the last chapter or two, and is a twist rather than ""fluid"" finale, which some might like and some don't.Overall I would recommend this book to sci-fi readers."
4,The end was worth it,"There were a lot of fantastic ideas in here, but for some reason I can't put my finger on, the first 2/3 of the book went by rather slowly. It's not that nothing interesting happened. It's not that it was bad. And it wasn't enough for me to stop reading altogether. But for some reason I just couldn't get excited about it. However, the last 1/3 of the book flew by, and left me with an overall great opinion of the book. A bunch of unique concepts and generally good storytelling, make me give this 4 stars."
4,Vinge's concepts are worth the read.,"I was not so thrown off by the way this read. This book may not contain the ""flower"" of Card, but I really enjoyed Vinge's concepts. The sociology of the ""networked"" packs was a treat in itself. Vinge has a clear concept of future Computer networking and the value of information. Sometimes you just have to set aside the greens for the meat."
5,A very reguvenating Book,"The only book that I've read so far and had such a detailed view of a possible alien culture was the Helliconian Trilogy by Brian Aldiss. And even that was totaly antropocentric. Mr. Vince has done an excellent job in giving us the everyday life of an alien culture and more importantly the ways that would have been used to over come tasks that we singletons take for granted. Great book, thrilling plot, couldn't put down every one of the six times that I've read it."
3,"interesting ideas, the kindle links are just annoying",not the best crafted of his works and the psuedo hypertext is slow to access and generally not that interesting.
3,"Excellent, a real page turner, but 200 pages too long","I'm not going to write a long review here as others have already. Love the book. A real page turner! It's not a space opera (annoying cliché ridden reviewers!), it's an imaginative, if unlikely, tale about galactic civilizations with some fascinating characters and alien races. However, just when i thought the story was getting somewhere, it would take a detour for 100 pages of mind-numbing detail about a non interesting and unlikely civilization. I get the Hugo award but doubt if most who voted read it cover to cover. Its strong on ideas, but dull on execution. I was ready to put the book down after 400 pages...then it kept droning on and on...500 pages...oh god, can we please get TO THE POINT?! I had to start skipping passages in order to finish it. A grand story with at least 200 pages of absolutely USELESS material yhat should have been edited out."
3,Pretty Good SciFi,"The overly enthusiastic hype for this book almost spoiled my enjoyment of it. It is not great, but great science fiction (i.e.- Hyperion by Dan Simmons) is very hard to come by these days. A Fire Upon the Deep is good, with enough thought provoking, creative aliens, new concepts in astrophysics and stimulating plot twists and dialogue to carry you into a few late night reading sessions. Several glaring inconsistencies in the behavior of the main characters mar, but do not destroy the credibility of the plot. Some fundamental questions remain painfully unanswered. But, overall a fine read. Space opera lives."
5,"Great Book, Very Interesting Ideas","I really don't understand the bad reviews. I thought the writing style was fine, it held my interest, but most of all the universe he creates is simply incredible! Very interesting..."
1,loaded with errors; think carefully before purchase,"This book shows what is so very wrong with the technical-book industry.It has not been edited.Wiley-Interscience seems to think it has no obligation to pay someone to carefully read the manuscripts they receive, in order to locate factual and technical errors, and correct them.""History of Wireless"" includes many errors, including the classic ""Sony invented the transistor radio"" one. It also grovels at the feet of James Clerk Maxwell, which is out of place in a book of this sort.I was so turned off by these things that I (literally) tossed the book aside and have not read any more of it. I remain interested in the history of radio; perhaps someday when I have nothing better to do with my time I will return to this book."
5,Only accurate way to measure CYA,All those test strips are very inaccurate in measuring the CYA. This Taylor reagent is the only way to do it using the drop test method (where you mix it with 7ml pool sample water and 7ml of this reagent) and you drop it into the cylinder tube till the black dot at the bottom is no longer visible. No other accurate way.
1,"Liked a lot of features of this bag, but it wore out fast","I liked many features of this bag but there were signs of excessive wear on certain parts after three months of use.In particular, the part that was damaged was where the metal end of the strap rubs against the edge of the bag on both sides when you actually wear it on your shoulder."
1,"Buckles Rub Against Side, Causing Premature Wear","The buckles rub against the side of the bag and cause premature wear. I have owned this for five month and do not recommend this bag. Targus is a good brand but this bag is not good. I'd look at the KOS301, which is the following release after this (KOS300)."
2,Not Great,"This is a decent sub-1Megapixel camera if you aren't too concerned about color. It doesn't get colors right at all. Plus, the time to process a picture is way too long. Don't use the included software for the camera - go to the Largan web site and download the twain driver. Additionally, the pictures are always overexposed with the flash. My advice; don't bother."
3,"Good camera, bad software and instruction manual","This camera was given to me as a gift, as i had benn wanting to go digital. The first thing that the instruction booklet should tell you is that to turn on the power you must open the front cover as far as it will go (while opening it it reaches a stopping point and you think that its open all the way but you need to push it a little further to turn it on. The camera itself is ok for the price and it takes pretty good pics however the instruction booklet is horrible ! it gave very little info on downloading and copying. I ended up using the software from a different digital camera as the software included did not work. All in all the camera itself is great but not the software or instruction manual."
1,Awful software makes camera useless,"It can take hours to get a few random pictures to download from the camera. Software support is unreachable. The little documentation provided is poor.Every time I turn on the camera it behaves differently, so it is impossible to reliably take a picture and get it on the computer. Sometimes the buttons work, other times they do nothing. If your are lucky enough to get it to download it is then difficult to get the picture in a useable format like JPG or bitmap. Often turning the camera off makes it lose all of its pictures.Save your money, time and sanity by buying some crayons and an art book."
1,A very frustrating camera!,This camera was purchased with ebay listings in mind. When I can get the photos to load they are fine for computer usage. BUT it is a rare occasion when this is possible. The software for the camera is horrible. Largan's technical support is even worse. Avoid purchasing this camera at all costs!
3,"Acceptable, with limits","Like most other reviewers, we found flash closeups to be grossly overexposed.Since we take a LOT of such flash closeups, we simply made a small ""hat"" made from a strip of copy paper to fit over the flash. End of problem.As to unpredictability of the flash: The camera doesn't need much light to decide for itself the flash isn't needed. We tend to set the camera to force a flash and use the ""hat"" as described above. Outdoor pictures are generally very good, but certainly not up to mega-pixel quality.The camera IS a bit of a battery-hog, but since it comes with an AC adapter, we often use the adapter for those indoor closeups. Battery savings hint: The camera uses battery #123, a single 3-volt cell. Buy a battery #223, which has TWO 123's in it, and use them, IF you're willing to crack open the plastic case, which isn't the easiest thing to do, but saves you about 30-40% over the cost of 2 #123's."
1,Short lifespan,"I used this camera for about 30 photos over a 5 month period. Took okay quality photos, but one day it just quit working, tried a new battery even though right before it quit it said my battery was good. New battery didn't revive it."
2,If you scared of this new technology!,"You can use this as a teaching tool. You can take a few pictures, lerne how to down load, and learn a lot about the including software.It would be a valuable and relatively inexpensive tool, befor you spend a lot of money on a better camera."
2,Something's lacking,"This CD features what might be called elevator polka music. It would be good Muzak in an office full of polka lovers. An electronic organ by itself just doesn't cut it, even though today's instruments are a far cry from those played in the 50s by Ken Griffin. A real bass fiddle should replace the organ pedals, with perhaps a trumpet and some vocals added as well. Listening to any of these tracks reminds me of the ""real"" versions I have heard by other artists, even when there have been several ""real"" versions which have not reminded me of each other. Better choices would be CDs by Frankie Yankovic, Jimmy Sturr, or Joey Miskulin, or by Fred Ziwich and the International Sound Machine (you'll have to browse by the ""polka"" keyword to find the latter). The Happy Organ needs a little help."
4,a very pleasing sound,I am a disc jockey for polka and international ethnic music in new jersey and florida for promotional play please e-mail me i would be willing to play this on the air for people to hear contact me via e mail for more info. thanks ann slack
2,Compared to the previous 11 releases....,"...it's just ok. I first learned of them when my college roommate played me his ""They Might Be Giants"" album (the debut) back in 1987. I loved it. When ""Lincoln"" came out, I was *really* hooked. I've managed to find something I really liked on all their releases...even found stuff I liked on ""Mink Car"". I also realize that it takes 3-5 compelte listens before their stuff starts to stick. I've listened to this one 10 times and only like 2 tunes, ""Climbing The Walls"" and ""Bee of The Bird of The Moth"". ""Take Out The Trash"" is just awful. I can't help but agree with the ""it is over-produced"" comments.Heck, maybe after a few dozen more listens I'll finally get it."
5,Definitely grows on you!,"Initially, some songs caught my attention faster than others, naturally the fast ones (I'm Impressed, Take Out the Trash, Withered Hope, Mesopotamians). As the week went by, I began to grasp all the tracks as a whole, as a gestalt experience.It was a shock to me that Take Out the Trash was not really about garbage. Does it seem like ""leave your skanky boyfriend"" is a little below TMBG's usual standard for song themes? Or do They have a standard? Or are They being parodistic and going over my head again, which would raise it back to standard?Bee of the Bird of the Moth is brilliant in a quiet way. The beat makes me think of droning bee/bird/moth wings. But what do I know about music as it relates to insects?The BONUS CD is a BONUS - it's a gift, just like their free downloads. Appreciate it! Hooray for generosity & prolificacy!"
3,Tasty but insubstantial,There are some great tracks here. TMBG fans will mostly be satisfied by the offerings. The Johns have gone for a more jangly sound that I didn't know what to make of at first. Unfortunately there isn't an amazing stand out track that breaks new ground or has the potential to win back fans who have turned away from them after so many years.
4,"More guitars, but still vintage Giants","They Might Be Giants have a lengthy catalogue, with trademark squirrelly music, bizarre but oftentimes clever lyrics and hooks to reel us in. The new CD ""The Else"" doesn't stray from the time-tested Giants formula, which is a good thing since they cover such a broad spectrum anyway.This CD is a bit better than the last, ""The Spine"", which didn't have the hooks some earlier efforts like ""Apollo 18"" or ""Lincoln"" had. The guitars play a bigger role in this outing, making ""The Else"" a rocking set indeed.Among my favorites this time is ""The Shadow Government"", with some of the funniest lyrics TMBG has done in quite a while. ""Take Out The Trash"" is a clever blend of trash and love, and many of us could testify that the line between the two can be pretty thin.All in all, this is a good collection, but my personal favorites are still ""Apollo 18"" and ""Lincoln"". TMBG fans will not be disappointed."
2,The worst yet,"I thought The Spine was their worst album, but it has been defeated by the dismal The Else. Past albums have had a blend of fun, witty, often-educational lyrics with decent-to-great music. This album has uninspired lyrics that are upstaged in the mix by bland music. Top it off with a mere 38 minute run-time and you've got a horrible value. To add insult to (metaphorical) injury, I did not get the bonus disc (which I probably would have liked). The ONLY good song on the album (and the only reason I'm giving it two stars) is The Mesopotamians - good music and a fun lyrical concept. The rest of the album, well, isn't. I am sorely disappointed. After 20+ years of listening to TMBG, this will likely be the last album of theirs I buy."
4,I'm NOT all that impressed...,"Out of the over 30 songs on this 2-disc set, I can actually say that I really like about 12. I think more from the second disc should have been included on the first disc. The standout tracks from disc 1 for me are ""I'm Impressed"", ""Take Out The Trash"", the amazing ""Withered Hope"" and my personal favorite ""Climbing The Walls"". Everything else is sort of... ""eh"". The second disc, however, is chock full of great tracks: ""The Hardest Nut"", the hilarious ""Why Did You Grow A Beard?"" a new version of ""Metal Detector"" and ""I'm Your Boyfriend Now"" to name a few. Really, buy this for the second disc and then compile your own ""The Else"". It's fun!"
3,Lackluster performance,"There are a couple of good songs but, overall, the album is a pretty lackluster perfprmance by TMBG. I was really disappointed in this disc. It's nowhere near as good as ""Flood.""Not recommended."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"After 2004's dismal The Spine TMBG are back to add insult to injury with this logical extension of that impression of a high school garage band discovering modern electronics. The drum parts are relentlessly rudimentary miring these songs in a mid-tempo plod that is the antithesis of the playful peppyness these guys made a name for themselves with in the 80s and 90s. The Else is pretty indisputably the band's least melodic album, as well as the worst produced, every instrument compressed into a muffled mid-range ""i just got protools and i don't know wtf i'm doing"" drone. Possibly Stephen Hawking could shed some light on how the band that wrote Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head, Birdhouse In Your Soul and Dr Worm could take any pride in a single song on this record."
1,Beware: Not the version advertised,"I bought this item because the ""track"" listing specifically lists a number 14, signifying that it includes the special multi-track bonus CD (an entire second CD, not actually a fourteenth track), entitled ""Cast Your Pod To The Wind."" However, the item I received included no bonus CD. All I got for my money was the standard release single CD, featuring tracks 1 through 13."
3,Might be great if two of the four percussion buttons worked!,"Ya know, I was all pumped up about giving this to my 3.5-year-old son for Christmas 2008. All the reviews were great. Seemed like a winner. Last night, however, before I wrapped it, I tested it out and the snare and hi-hat buttons didn't work. Also, if you look up ""Winfun Sing-Along Magic Keyboard"" on amazon.com, you'll find this very keyboard along with a review that calls this item's durability/quality into question. I, unfortunately, must do the same. Wish I could give it a better endorsement. . . ."
5,My daugther likes thise piano,"it is colorful for baby, even though my daughter (11months)is not old enough to play it but she like the color and watch me to press keys."
5,We love this one,I like the fact that we can make all different sounds for cydney and she just loves to listen to it.. Can't wait till she can play with it herself
4,Satisfied,"The Magic Music Maker Keyboard was a good choice for my grandson, aged 3. He seems to enjoy it, while it stimulates his interest in music."
3,Fantastic book with no reference? Disappointed just for this!,"I have been reading 'Dirt' for a few weeks now. I have already finished reading once and started all over again. The book is amazing. I loved it. Language, presentation, information are all valuable. HOWEVER, there are no references, no bibliography of the book. This is extremely disappointing for me. 'No reference' downgraded the value of the book, and the science in it as well. Sad!"
4,Short and Sweet...,"Clearly, the first part of this book was based on research done for ""Cadillac Desert"" and focuses on the history of growth and water supplies for San Francisco and LA. However, the second and third sections are new: the second section covers the vulnerability of these water supplies to earthquakes (many earthquake faults cross where the water supply lines are built, The third section is a quite realistic scenario of what would happen in the Bay Area in the event of a 7.2 (I think) earthquake. The book is very readable."
4,Cadillac Desert Lite,"One wonders what this book could have been had Mr. Reisner lived to complete it, but under the circumstances it is a quick but worthy look the subject. The reader must make allowances for the passage of time, and take in the big picture. It would be a good book for students not yet ready for the plunge into Cadillac Desert, as well."
5,"Very interesting matrial - history, fact, and prognosis.","I'm getting really tired of writing these reviews on all the books I choose to read. ""It was very good should be enough words!"""
4,Earthquakes and their aftermath,"This book makes the point that it isn't earthquakes alone that cause life on California soil to be precarious. It's the fact that so much basic and necessary infrastructure crosses over or has been built directly on top of active fault lines, particularly in the Bay Area and specifically the fault line most likely to produce a 7.0 or greater earthquake. In addition are numerous possibilities for fires to erupt in the immediate aftermath of such a quake, just when access to water supplies may be drastically affected or the supplies themselves reduced.Whatever quarrels one might have with the author's decision to create a fictionalized account of an earthquake on that scale, and despite the disappointment that he did not live to complete this book as he might have wished, he's given us a persuasive collection of information that should register loud & clear on any reader's internal Richter scale."
4,I only wish Reisner had written more,"This book is very different from Cadillac Desert, which is amazing, but touches on a few of the same issues. Overall, a good book - worth reading."
3,hearty soup bowl,"These are nice heavy stoneware bowls (not your typical lightware Corelle). Attractive, rugged, but not pretty design. Who wants hot chili or hearty stew out of 'pretty' bowls! Packed well and no breakage. I tested one with water in the microwave to see if they 'super-heated' and it did not seem to but the bowl was very warm up to the point where the liquid came up to on the inside. Slight flaws, i.e., small glaze pinhole on inside of one bowl, small raised particle in glaze on inside of two bowls. I would consider these glaze flaws making them 2nds in quality. That said, I kept them as I didn't have time to find/exchange for another gift. If I had been purchasing in a store, I would have moved on."
4,Very good psychic thriller,"Just another year and another award nomination for Brit Marling, this one a psychic thriller where once again the viewer is compelled to use their mind a little bit more than with most films. Very, very good at 4 out of 5 stars for me......"
4,Interesting title Puzzling movie,"There were some truly troubling sequences in this movie and they made you think about who's who, and what are they saying and how much of it to believe, The film was medium, lukewarm to and I'd only reccommend it if you want to think because it is a cerebral movie."
4,Good,"Great concept and very nicely produce indie film. great script, recommend for any fan of indie films and good screenwriting"
2,Whispery people,There are more characters in this movie that I felt like beating the snot out of than anything I can remember. Everyone talks softly and earnestly. Worst closing song I've ever heard. You do not have a big message and I'm not slow. No need for last minute recap .Saying that I was interested enough to see how it finished.
3,Expected more,"I felt from the description that this sounded like it could be an interesting movie, but it wasn't my cup of tea. Just didn't seem to go anywhere for me."
2,Sound of My Voice,"Cold, predictable, and exceedingly dull. The writing is just so bad. No sensitivity or heart. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because the acting by the two leads - Christopher Denham and Nicole Vicius is decent. This film is just embarrassingly self-important and totally forgettable."
1,The most boring slow movie ever made,"The movie consists of a few people talking is a basement, thats it, looks like high school, or perhaps some junior high kids made this, do not see thus junk, you will be mad you waisted your time as I was"
1,"It is an intriguing concept, it is far from horror.",Had me at a few moments but all in all it was very disatisfying. Slow burn with over character devolopment without a satisfactory story. Just move on!
2,Kinda cheap,"This movie builds up to one scene of interest and then it ends.The entire time this movie is playing and a ""piece"" of the ""story"" is revealed I was like well that's interesting now isn't it...whatever will happen by the end?Answer: the credits will role.One reviewer compared the ending to be the easy way out and they are so right.If it wasn't for the freaking handshake you'd have no movie and as far as I'm concerned this is barely a movie to begin with.ANYBODY can dream up a nice unsolvable mystery and leave it unexplained that's not talent it's just cheap and a real good way of saying ""I had no idea how to end this"".There's no point to this movie and there is certainly no closure or even a lame attempt at some.Watch it if you want but if you're not a fan of the un-answered or un-explained then your gonna want to watch something else."
4,surprise ending,"As this movie went on, I doubted the integrity of the main character. But the way it ended was the mind blower. Watch it just for the ending."
4,time traveler or grifter,"Brit Marling's second film as a writer/actress continues to expand on the promise she exhibited in her first effort ""Another Earth."" Both film's are low budget independent productions that tackle big ideas. In this case, the story involves a young couple hoping to expose a underground religious cult as fraudulent. Marling, who co-wrote the screenplay, does a superb job of portraying the leader of the cult, Maggie, who claims to have come from the future. Whether she is actually a time traveler or some kind of fanatical zealot becomes the central question of the film; one which Marling never explicitly answers, preferring to let the audience draw their own conclusions. This is hardly a slick production, but I prefer this type of film to much of the fare being produced by the big studios today. I predict we will continue to see growth and good things from marling in the near future."
3,Sound of my voice,"The movie was steady in its story telling, but became disconnected when a new character was introduced inwhich dialog between two people was not revealed."
2,really good until the last bit (no spoilers),Sound of My Voice was really good and really original but the ending ruined it all for me and made it so i won't ever watch it again.It's like the cast tried really hard until the last twenty minutes where it pretty much just stopped having effort put into it.The plotline is pretty cool though its about investigative journalists getting involved ina cult for report purposes but eventually find themselves in over their heads. It's not scary or a thriller or action packed. It's just a somewhat unnerving note on cults.i highly recommend you rent it or get it from the library first
3,"Independent movie with some good acting and suspence, but bit of a let down at the end","This was nicely acted and was suspenceful, but the ending was not very satisfying - no real closure. The actors are believable and well cast. It plays like an indie movie in terms of the camera angles and set-up, which are all pretty simple and straightforward."
2,"I was told this movie was ""different""...that doesn't come close.","I have no idea what I was supposed to make of this movie. I kept waiting for ""something"" to happen...maybe it did and I blinked and missed it. But, really seemed like there could be a cool twist or something. Just felt like I wasted 2 hours and got zilch out of it."
2,FAILED.,"Runs hot. Very hot. Will burn your hand; keep children/animals away. Put a fan on it if you've got to leave it on for more than a few hours. *Do not stack these drives* -- LIKE STACKING FIREWOOD.---Buslink customer service non-existent.---Head crashed after about 6 months. Did, however, work fine before that happened."
4,HRM Cream,"This product is easy to use and does indeed increase the ability of the HRM to receive your pulse. Unfortunately, however, I still get dropped heart rate readings when I am in full out running mode. My heart rate signal gets picked up again when I slow down to a walking pace."
3,will not fix a broken monitor,"Unlike many other reviews, the heart rate monitor cream did not solve my problem. I continued to not get a signal in the middle of my workouts after purchasing both the cream and a tighter strap. I finally had to just buy a new watch and monitor and have not had a problem since."
5,Perfect! Thank you,"When I do get a small window to work out, I don't have time to waste to get my heart rate monitor to work. Water usually works but when it doesn't I can waste 1/2 my workout trying to get the device to read my pulse. I found Spectra 360 Electrode Gel to be only slightly better than water. Buh-Bump cream, on the other hand, works perfectly every time, no issues ever. It takes so little to work the tube should last a long time. I highly recommend this stuff for use with heart monitors."
4,Good,"Seems to help the heart rate pick up in dry conditions (until you get sweaty, and then that takes care of it). I've used just regular lotion before, I think this leaves less residue."
3,It works,It's electrode cream. There's not really much to say. But I have used my polar heart rate monitor without it and there is no question that it works much better than saliva or waiting for enough sweat to build up to make a connection. Just a dab will do ya.
3,Helps for flaky readings,"I have the Garmin HRM and have had a ton of problems. While this did not solve them, it did help a lot in alleviating the issues I was having. Recommended for those with issues particularly in the colder months."
4,something unique and special,"I got this CD over two years ago and it is one of those recordings that I keep coming back to. I actually like it more now than I did when I first started listening. Yung's voice and her songs will give something to your soul and spirit that is hard to define, but I encourage anyone to listen and check it out for themselves. Love this music."
5,Classic Dead,"The vocals are disjointed, the levels are off, and the songs are generally way too fast. But it doesn't matter, and you won't care! This is the most raw Grateful Dead you will ever hear. Golden Road is a jolly good time, Minglewood and Beat it on Down the Line have got the fury, and Morning Dew and Viola Lee are the Dead we all know and love."
3,Dead Head,they are just starting out you can tell that on this cd . You can tell that something is missing
5,A Definite Must Have,"This group of recordings is probably one of the most definitive piecesdone by the band containing one of my all time favorites,""Morning Dew"",which due to unknown circunstances was dropped from their LIVE LP(GoldenGate Park recording) to which warranted much nasty response from some( me for one,many letters to Warners) and of course Good Morning Little School Girl demonstrating the bands ability to adhere to standard rocknroll as well as the intricacies of jazz and bluegrass."
2,blah,This book was not what I had expected. The print was very small and looked as if it had been printed in someones garage. I can honestly say after purchasing it I have only looked through it twice and that was enough. Also most of the activities listed in this book are much more compatible with intermediate/middle school vs primary.
1,"Wow, was I wrong - DO NOT BUY!!","In my previous review, below, I said this was a great battery. Wrong! After three weeks of use, my phone began to randomly shut itself off. I was convinced it was my phone and tried to have it repaired. I later found out that it was the battery. This battery is subject to frequent overheating and when it reaches a certain point, your phone will just shut off. I was also told that prolonged use of this battery will ultimately damage the phone. When I think about how much I paid for this battery, I get even more upset. Essentially I paid Technocel[price]to damage my phone. I don't know if anyone else is having this problem, but if you are... now you know. DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY!"
2,Pretty poor quality,I have ordered several of the costumes from this company and they are pretty poorly made. The material is really thin and they do not hold thier shape and cannot be ironed to smmoth the pleats. They never look like the pictures.
5,"The Everly Brothers' ""Pet Sounds""","A splendid pulling together of the threads of Don & Phil's work to this point, with intriguing hints of what might have been to come. Framed by excellent renderings of two Merle Haggard prison songs (""Mama Tried"" and ""Sing Me Back Home""), a nod to their Cadence Work (""I Wonder If I Care As Much""), contemporary pop/rock(Randy Newman's ""Illinois"", Ron Elliot's ""Turn Around""), their country/folk ""roots"" (""Shady Grove,""Jimmy Rogers'""T For Texas"" and the tapes of their radio work) this is a thoroughly delightful set. Lenny Waronker, their Warner Brothers producer was also doing excellent work at the time with VanDyke Parks(""Song Cycle""), the Beau Brummels (""Bradley's Barn"") and Randy Newman. Comparable to the Beach Boys' ""Pet Sounds"" as the best album-length realization of what had been up til then a singles band.Roughly contemporary with a masterpiece of another order: ""From Elvis In Memphis."""
5,Light through a dust storm is this album!,"Wow!Everybody knows their cadence hits,but that wasn't it for the brothers.By 1968,the boys weren't rackng up hits like the old days and were still going like true musicians:Not surrendering to current trends,nor simply treading along the same old musical path.They were updating and experimenting with their sound.The same gorgeous vocals and guitar playing,but a broader sense of emotional color is reached with strings,pedal steel,etc.This is close to the Byrds(or were the Byrds close to THEM?)This is a fine album."
3,Club protection is great but need more pockets and towel rings,"I really like the roller bag, it makes it a lot easier transporting clubs to and from the car. I have a handicap so this feature helps a lot. I really like the individual club dividers so each club has it's own sleeve. I hate it when clubs won't go in the bag or you have trouble getting them out when the grips get entangled. I wish there were a few more pockets and a few more towel rings for bag tags, towels, tee pouch, etc."
2,great cart bag,the bag has wheels and instead of carrying it you roll the bag to the club house. a pull handle pulls out in order to roll along and the bag fits in cart perfectly
4,Fast shipping,"The book arrived very quickly and was in great shape (no bent pages and the binding was perfect). In terms of the product itself, who really gets excited about a stats textbook? There is a newer edition of the book, but my professor chose the older edition so we didn't have to pay as much. I guess the questions are different between the two editions, but the text and examples are basically identical."
2,Made for Statistics Majors who are prone to Memorization,"If you like to understand how things work then this book is horrible in its explanations. Just a little bit of mathematics and some pseudocode for the procedures would have made some sense out of this attempt. For each area, find a good paperback to supplement your graduate travels through this text and you will be fine."
5,GREAT book,"I am taking a 500 level statistic course and this book is requirement. It is easy to read, it has most of the data online for minitab so it does the job."
3,Statistcs,The binding was torn when I received the book... I wish they would have mentioned that in the description. Other than that it was a good book.
3,Review,I was glad to get the book in good condition. Came in about 2 weeks which is great cause I ordered standard shipping. I was also notified at every stage such as dispatch and shipments.
2,Just okay.,"This stats book was helpful in some chapters, but very confusing in others. I am a straight-A student & had to turn to other internet-based resources to supplement the information in this book. Even my professor decided he was going to ditch this book next year after using it in his class for only 2 semesters."
4,re-intro to basic Stats for biologists,"I am returning to the biology field and am retaking a statistics course. This is the required textbook for the course, and along with the lecture, I find the text very helpful. There are examples with clear answers at the end of each section, and again many problems, some with answers, at the end of each chapter. A very sufficient supplement for the course."
3,Only Available for PC,"I would have loved to get the digital edition of this book, either rent or buy, but its only available on the PC which (I suspect intentionally) makes it effectively useless. I guess I'll have to stick with sharing the physical edition with my friends."
2,OK,These shoes were ok. I almost returned them and then decided to hold onto them thinking maybe I would change my mind--I haven't. The fit is tight (esp. width) and they're just really uncomfortable. I haven't worn them at all and really wish I could still return them.
2,not so exciting...,"The experiments didn't look very fun, If I'd seen this in a brick and mortar store, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,Science for children,"I am a teacher with a headstart program, and was having trouble coming up the ideas that would hold the children's attention. When I came across this book I wasn't sure if I could adpat them for the age group I teach. Was I wrong! The children loves the activities in this book and so did my 16 year old whom tries all my activities. If you need to teach science to children this is the book to buy."
3,7 year old girl loves,We purchased this for our then 7 year old daughter. My husband and her have done several experiments out of it and love it. My husband is really into experiments (he's a big kid) and so is my daughter and they have really enjoyed spending time together to do these. One very good thing about this book is that a lot of the experiments use things most people have around the house.
4,Not bad...,"What I like about these, is that they are recycled. They are not as ""fantastic"" as Bounty but Bounty towels aren't recycled, and the quality is not that bad that I would revert to Bounty. I will definitely agree with other reviewers that often it won't rip exactly at the dotted line and often leave a triangular piece behind at the bottom when ripping out a sheet quickly, and that is frequently annoying -- but again, not enough to make me switch to a non-recycled product. Overall I'd purchase again, if only to do something better for the environment (which I hope I am by purchasing these)."
2,Please Make it Better!,"I bought this item since it is recycled, but it is too thin and doesn't obsorb much. The plus is that it doesn't have much lint either. I will buy again if they made the sheets thicker."
4,best eco paper towel,"-1 for marketing strategypaper towels are a marketing stragedy, meaning they are completely unnecessary and if the company actually cared about the environment so much, they would educate people not to use paper towels, besides that these are the best eco papers towels, i got em because i was dumber more earlier on...Hare Krsna"
1,"Details, Details, Details! Very Important!","The mirror I recieved has very little detail! Something important in an item such as this. It's meant to be a lighthouse near the ocean, with a tiny sail boat in the background upper left. In what I recieved it appers to be a run down cottage with a billowing grassy field, with a tiny sail boat in the background upper left. I can not tell you how very sad, angry, and disappointed I was when I opened this today. It was meant to be a birthday gift for a very close friend of mind in 2 days. I can not give her this horrible piece of carnival trash. I would be at a loss to explain just what it is. I will be returning it tomorrow, and requesting the full amount of the product, and the 20.00 shipping fees. That's to ensure the promise it arrives not broken. Wish it had broke.... I am going to post a picture of the one I recieved, please take notice of the DETAILS in the popcorn ceiling in the clear portion or the mirror."
1,A GOOD BOOK WITH A POOR TRANSLATION,"This is a pleasant novel by Danilo Dolci, but the English in it is of awkward quality and doesn't do it justice. Like most things Vitiello touches, it sounds convoluted, dull and flat. Perhaps, he's a good scholar, but his own poetry in English is as dull, flat and convoluted as all of his translations. The other translator would do well to stay away from him as he gives her work a bad name. He simply doesn't understand English and its idioms well enough to do a good job of translation.A reader from Paterson Community College"
2,I thought everybody knew this stuff...,"I was disappointed in this book; very little in it was not common sense. Though it does contain valuable information that one should always bear in mind, its contents of very basic manners were things I had been taught since a child."
2,Misnomer Title,"I was disappointed in this book. The title should have been something like, ""A Lady Does or Does Not . . . ."" The book gives many ""lady"" imperatives, but does not give as many specifics on ""HOW to Be a Lady."" An example is the imperative, ""A lady knows when it is acceptable to drink through a straw."" That's it; there is no further information as to the next obvious question: When is it acceptable for a lady to drink through a straw? Also it bothered me about some incorrect grammar. I know that ""a lady does not correct another's grammar,"" but in these published words, someone fell down on the job of editing. There were several instances of incorrect subject-verb agreement. One would expect a lady to know better or know that she needs aid in the written English before putting ink to published page. Overall this book is too simplistic and does not live up to the title of ""HOW To Be a Lady."""
2,is this really a joke book?,"I bought this book looking for a reference for teenagers on how to make decisions about proper ladylike behavior, manners and fashion. Instead, it has become one of our favorite ""make funny quotes"" about books. Some of the items listed are far outdated and downright silly, such as ""A lady wears clean and fresh underwear""......give me a break!! Stick with Emily Posts Etiquette book. She addresses the real life issues associated with everyday life."
2,"a great idea, but not much there","Not one that I would suggest. As a collector of style and etiquette books, I thought this book would be one that I would really enjoy. It turned out to be a disappointment. The advice was vague and obvious and it wasn't all that much fun to read. An interesting note: Brooks Brothers has started selling this book along with several other similar ones at their stores. I bought one called ""how to raise a lady"". It was also a disappointment."
4,A good book for the lady who needs a few modern tips,"This a great book for the lady who needs a few pointers on certain situations, or the older lady who isn't sure what is appropriate now as opposed to when she was younger.This is not the book for the totally unladylike. It is somewhat limited in topics, but it was a quick read, and it's advice will stay with me. The book could be given as a gift to a family member without necessarily being considered an insult."
4,Needed knowledge,This book contains material that all of us need to know and abide by. Courtesies lost by many especially our young people.
1,Do NOT buy,"In general, the book is badly organized, chapters and ideas are not connected.Also, the book has very little information how to be a lady; while some advice(like ""not to be late"") is repeated way too many times.The information I was looking for (the language, manners, etc) is missing."
2,outdated and missed a lot of subjects,"I read this book in one sitting. It had some useful tips but at the same time was not modern at all. I was also hoping to read about ""relationship etiquette"" but it didn't cover that.I bought this book hoping to learn something and I didn't.."
1,"Should be called ""Go get a PAP smear""","A lady does not discuss what other people do with their bodies, nor does she insist that anyone grope themselves or have a physical exam. It's not on her damn business and she knows it. Yet the author does not, and repeatedly demands that women have a variety of intimate exams performed. Most of the other book is no-brainer, if mildly controversial, material (if at times repetitive). But the author crosses the line when she gets into readers' pants and tops! Go advocate for more fundiong for breast cancer research somewhere else. This isn't the place."
3,Incomplete,"I agree with another reviewer that this book is incomplete in its advice on ""how to be a lady"". In my very humble opinion, a lady would have provided further explanation instead of repeated, one-sentence instructions. Some issues only require one sentence, but other issues do require some instruction for those who are less-educated on the finer details of etiquette."
1,Garbage,I ordered this product. Use it intermittently for 5 weeks. It stopped working but not before first blowing the fuse in my car.The return date had passed so I'm stuck with a piece of useless garbage.
1,It sucks,I used it only a couple of times and had problems with it. Then it finally stopped working completely. It looks cool but it's (...). And I could not return it either because the time had expired.
2,I'm sure I've seen these before,"And I have. Frank used to run a tutorials site which contained a large portion of the content of this book FOR FREE. Many of the techniques for character modeling were outdated years before this book was even published. The section on special effects using spheres is especially disheartening, since trueSpace has had many plugins available for some time that were created for particle effects and other special effects. This is a decent book for a beginner, but to REALLY get to know the program, and if you can get a hold of it, pick up Peter Plantecs' trueSpace2 Bible. Since most of the features in trueSpace2 are in trueSpace 4, you can get that book cheaper and it's written MUCH better, and many of the tutorials in Inside trueSpace4 were written FOR trueSpace 2, you'd be better off"
2,This Book Is Truely Not For Beginners!!,"This book is like the manual that comes with TS4, It assumes everyone knows something about 3D modeling and animation. If you are a beginner, be sure to keep the TS4 quick guide by your side. The book states that it is for the intermediate level, Know this before you buy it."
4,"SeaStories brings it ""too the shores""","Let Me be the 1st too say..where ""evrything i got in my pocket"" was a wonderful cd like a ship a-float on the ocean..and her vocals like a breeze of silk..this cd brings it too the shores..no sophmore slump here!! and she puts to rest along standing comment..""actors can't sing/singers can't act"">>she is the FULL package! also a wonderful song-writer!..i have listened to this disc 3 times already today, and only got it a few hours ago!..""sorry baby"" is a fun up-tempo track..and ""beloved"" is wonderful!..it's the perfect, what i call ""sunday-record""..put on the coffee, read the paper, and just relax and listen!...the only reason i gave it 4-stars is, that for me i just wanted it NOT too end..so really (it's a 5)..i could go on..but then you wouldn't have time to really enjoy the magic (of what i HOPE the record companies keep around)of Minnie Driver!...Peace..may your ears stay happy Bill McClenthan"
4,"Minnie Driver ""Seastories""","I had no idea that Minnie Driver was such a gifted singer. I knew and admired her work as an actor. This is a very soft, provocative collection of songs. I would highly encourage you to give this cd a listen."
4,Pleasntly Surprised!,"I love Minnie Driver the actress and had heard her sing at some celebrity function and some benefit fundraising concerts and was intrigued to hear her as a studio performer and purchased this Seastories CD. Wow, she really has a great voice and a very polished style! She's the real deal!"
4,Surprise!,"This is the second recording of songs written and performed by Minnie Driver. Ok, I admit it, I have a soft spot for Miss Driver. She is a very good singer, but her writing is not of the first rank. Still I enjoyed this CD and recommend you listen to it. Way to go, Minnie!"
5,I hope this is the first of many more,"I saw Minnie Drive in San Francisco two nights ago.She is ABSOLUTELY amazing. This CD is ABSOLUTELY superb. I never tire of it--and I've only listened to it at least 20 times.Minnie, please don't stop and continue with this gorgeous music."
5,A chilling psychological thriller,"A serial killer may be at large. Six talented women with various handicaps have disappeared without a trace. The only link between them seems to be the Trevellian family. Sharan Norbeth , a disfigured artist, goes undercover to discover the truth, but comes close to being victim number 7. Just when you think you have figured out who the villain is, the plot takes a twist and turn. The story keeps you on edge and is a very satisfying read for fans of mystery and psychosexual thrillers."
3,LISA HAS ISSUES!,"UNFORTUNATLY, THIS READS LIKE A TABILOID. I WOULD LIKE TO READ HER STORY FROM HER PERSPECTIVE, BUT I DOUBT SHE WILL WRITE HER OWN AUTOBIOGRAPHY."
2,save your money,"I got this as a gift, and it was nothing special. You can read bad poetry online anywhere. if you are going to buy a poetry book, buy a good one. This was tired, whiny, with immature language and overused subjects. I give it to her that shes a kid, and they are pretty good for a young teenager. Still, not something i'd buy."
1,Junk,"Installed 2 of these less than a year ago. One failed completely, does not set time. Took it apart and found plastic gears with no teeth. Cheaply made Chinese junk. The other gets almost zero use so it's still ticking. Timex = junk."
2,i was jipped!!!!,"great film. bad ""film poster"" ..it had visible lines on the poster.. what the heck, man!!!"
3,pretty good,"ALthough the theme of the book is very important and impactful, the story itself was a let down. The whole idea of this ""alternative"" school is really weird. I also didn't like who the story ended at all. When you finally figure everything out, it just ends. It was a letdown."
4,People read this book,This book shows what some have to deal with and what their friends have to suffer. Everyone lies and just about everyone gets hurt. It's sad but makes the point that you can't trust too many people.
1,Horrendous.,"The inside flap of this book claims it is for children ""12 and up."" However, after reading it, I cannot help but think it is most suitable for an eight year old---at least, it sounds like it was written by one. The plot is predictable and dull, not to mention the characters are native and annoying. Alex is the type of girl who still believes in cooties, while Stacey is annoying just for the sake of it. Many parts of the story seemed to be in there to fill space (something this story should have despertaly avoided), not to mention the conculsion was heartily unsatisfactory."
4,a pleasant surprise,"This book was not at all what I thought it'd be like. It's a great read focusing on middle school students and sexual abuse. When Stacy comes to school at Forest Alternative, she thinks Simon, the teacher, is ""a babe"". As the story continues, Stacy tells Alex that it's obvious Simon has feelings for her, and not just student-teacher feelings. Alex starts to believe these lies though they aren't true, and Tim, Alex's best friend believes them too and gets jealous. Alex starts to be suspicious of Simon's actions especially on a class camping trip. When she visits Stacy's house and finds out a little bit about Stacy's family, she realizes she has made a terrible mistake - but it's too late. This story makes you want to keep reading and reading, and it show's the importance of believing in what you know is right - a must read!"
4,Fast,"This is a good quality printer. We needed something that would spit out pages quickly, and this printer doesn't dissapoint. Also, it seems to be a well built unit. If you're wanting something that will print out text real quickly, and do some fair quality color images in your print outs, then I'd recommend this.For those that are complaining about the photos, I have a suggestion - purchase a true photo printer. I'd recommend Canon over HP in that department."
2,Fast but drinks ink like a fish. Hope you have deep pockets.,"This printer does a good job like all the HP Deskjets I have owned. No problems there. My other HP Deskjets would start up automatically but this one? Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Tech service was no help. My biggest complaint is the ink! The cartridges for this thing are the most expensive HP offers and there are no generics out there yet. To make matters worse it drinks ink like a fish! I think HP is trying to make too much money on the ink these days. My next printer will not be an HP."
3,5 stars down to zero!,Bought my 6540 1-1/2 years ago. Loved it! Great printer including photos from 4x6 up to 8-1/2x11. No problems until this week. Changed black ink cart with a new hp #96 cartridge. It didn't work. I worked at it for a long time. Wrote to online customer service. Got a reply and he had me try a few things. Nothing doing! He had me print a test page and report a series of number results to him. He wrote back that the printer was not reading the new cartridge and I needed to repair or replace it! THE END? It might be the end of me being an hp fan. I've bought exclusively hp for the past 6 years and this problem really bothers me. I just paid over $30. for this ink cartridge and can't use it at all! No other options...........repair or replace? I live in rural MN and its over an hours drive to a major city. We'll see... On the plus side.......the online repair tech was very helpful and spelled things out very well in an easy to understand way.
4,hp 6540 just fine with Tiger,"Just hooked this printer up, 1-2-3! and there is no problem with Mac OSX 10.4.3I am also hanging on to a few Mac OS 9(classic) programs, so I also installed the Mac 9 drivers for this printer. no problems at all. This printer is so quiet, that I had to look to see if the document had in deed printed. The price is right, and HP product support is the best!"
1,"Hunk of Junk, HP cheaps it out again","This printer will fool you into thinking it is a ""robust"" business class machine. It isn't, the retaining clips on the springs for the cartridge holders make chinese toys look like Tonka toys. It's an obvious flaw that's designed to last about long enough to get through the warranty period then leave the user with a $125 paperweight.I haven't seen such an obvious piece of designed weakness since the HP2000 series, oh wait, that was another HP business class printer wasn't it. HP are resting on their laurels as far as actually producing a quality small business machine. Do Not Buy This Junk!"
2,laconic,"I had high hopes for this novel after reading the other Amazon reviews. To my displeasure, I found the novel wanting. It was lacking in suspense; both in plot and in character development. The main character 'aged' 20+ years throughout the course of the novel, but his outlook remained stagnant. Some readers/reviewers might consider his laconic and meandering personality to be refreshing, charmingly hard-boiled or amusing. I found it to be boring. I will give the novelist credit for his skillful depiction of an archetypal Kansas 'boom' town. But, disappointingly, there is little else to recommend."
5,The best Scott Phillips book and that's saying something,"COTTONWOOD is that rare read, lean and rich. A novel with a startlingly different sensibility; by turns- casually sensual, nerve hammering, and rictusly hilarious. In the American West of Mr. Scott Phillips, life-or- death decisions are forced by events without benefit of the facts, ever. A place where an evil whim, rotten luck or worse weather are as likely to kill as stupidity or bad judgment. Where the difference between lust and love is perhaps only a matter of the duration of the impulse. A land where death can be more deliverance than a threat. If COTTONWOOD was nothing more than this, it would still be great entertainment, but what makes this novel special is its powerful, almost off-hand observation of human decency even in the worst of its population. Thanks to the author's informed and enveloping style the Old West is made real in a new way."
4,Skeptic at first,"I am prone to motion sickness, whether it be car, plane, boat or train. I usually use dramamine but it makes me so sluggish and drowsy. My first experience with the SCAT wrist straps was on a train. Normally all the bouncing around would make my stomach do flip flops but with the straps fitted around the right wrist, I showed no signs of nausea. My brain was sensing the movement but the stomach was calm. My next experience was on an airplane flying home in some turbulent weather. Although it was a scary experience, my stomach did not get the nausea signals from the brain at all. This is a remarkable product. I always keep one with me at all times, cause you never know when you may need it. It takes a few minutes for the effect to start working and once taken off, everything goes back to normal shortly after that."
