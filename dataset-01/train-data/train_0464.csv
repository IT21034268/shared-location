5,A Mother's Dilemma,"Ms. Crittenden has captured in this look the essence of a common dilemma faced by many mothers, making those difficult choices regarding career and family and how best to satisfy competing demands on our time and emotions. Amanda may not be ""every woman"" but this reader was able to sympathize with her daily struggles and see in her a young mom just wanting to do the right thing, for herself and her family. Ms. Crittenden takes you on a journey, not only of Amanda's self discovery but likely of your own."
1,A thinly veiled attempt to further the author's agenda...,"I was given this book as a gift and looked forward to reading it, having a small baby and little time to read. Sadly, I was disappointed. I thought the book was okay, but really an attempt to subtlely foist the author's views on her readers (I found out later that the author is a political tv person and that her husband is a speechwriter, and it all made more sense). I thought her portrayal of the midwife as medically incompetent was unfortunate, as that is entirely inaccurate in my experience. Ultimately, Amanda Bright seemed to be unhappy as a stay at home mother, and I'm not sure that her husband making more money so she could buy a bigger house and drive a new Volvo would fix that."
1,Yawn!,"Crittenden's non-fiction is whiney, drole, outdated and boring...same can be said for her so-called ""fiction""."
2,Only got halfway through,"I just couldn't get into this book. The fact that Amanda couldn't catch a break ANYWHERE started to get on my nerves. I read the other reviews here and skipped to the end to see if the ending was as ridiculous as everyone said. I must say I concur with everyone else!I should have chucked this after Chapter 1, when Amanda snapped at her three year old daughter for saying ""Indian princess"" instead of ""Native Amercian princess"". Who the heck yells at a three year old for that?! I know this is only fiction, but if I ever came across this woman in real life, I would run the other way fast, taking MY three year old daughter with me!"
2,"Unhappy, pitiful, miserable main character","I thought the things were way out of proportion throughout the book.Most characters in the book are shallow and the main character of the book is not a likable person. She is just miserable!!! She chooses to be ashamed of everything going on in her life, her house, her car, her husband, her kids, her toenails, her hair... She does not like her 'best' friend, she does not like her other 'friends' which she financially cannot keep up with, she does not like her mother, and the list goes on and on. The book does not give a valuable discussion on being a working mother versus a stay at home mother and the emphasis is more on the husband's career!!!"
2,Point of view from the Mommy Wars,"Set in Washington D.C., Amanda Bright is a stay at home Mom who is conflicted about her decision to leave work and raise the kiddies. This is one of the most miserable characters I have ever read of in a novel. Jeez, as I was reading, I thought to myself, 'Develop a backbone! Stop whining and do something!'If you read the dustcover, the summary implies this story is 'hilarious.' It is nothing of the sort. For example, the character Amanda compares the DC mommies to broodmares. Well, I didn't find that funny. The comparison was very heavy handed.I hated the Amanda's epihphany moment at the end of the book. I felt lectured. I read this book and I want to write an Anti-Amanda character.I cannot recommend this book. One would be better off with a book from Jennifer Weiner."
3,Think I got factory seconds,Large bowl is perfect but the small ones have pricky points on the botton of each bowl. Thinking I got factory seconds.
5,Love Corelle,"I've been using Corelle forever and like the fact that you can pop them in the microwave with cereal, soup or anything. I've bought these in stores for years but was unable to find this 2-quart size without buying a whole set."
2,Explodes on impact,"If this bowl falls off a coffee table onto a hardwood floor, it doesn't just break, it detonates into a million super sharp slivers all over the room. No good for children, old people or disabled people. Other than that, great."
5,Nice bowl,"Bowl is very chip-resistant. Bowl has not etched in our dishwasher over a few months of use (and counting), and still has a glossy appearance. I would purchase again."
3,Re-recordings,"These are not the original recordings of Cristy Lane's greatest hits, although they are pretty good recreations. The original recordings from the '70s and early '80s can be found on a Cristy Lane CD called ""Greatest Country Hits."""
3,Not a Proud addition to the library,"This book just has scattered incunable information. If you do not need this text to complete a library, don't purchase it. The material is not that great. That being said, I have skimmed the book a couple of times. Certainly don't pay much money for this book."
3,Adequate,"The nose-pieces hurt after wearing for greater than an hour. Additionally, the chums-like securing strap is difficult to secure. I suspect it will loosen over time (I've been using them for approximately 1 month)."
3,Veggie Bags,"These are ok. I would not go out of my way to purchase them again. They do keep the onions and potatoes from sprouting....if you have nothing else, they work."
2,Onions and potatoes still molded with these bags,"I wasn't hugely pleased with these onion and potato bags.Both the potatoes and the onions sprouted and/or molded when I put them inside. The onions in particular molded and left a moldy powder all over, which forced me to clean the bags thoroughly. I think that in hotter climates, there isn't enough ventilation and so things get moldy pretty quickly.My thoughts: if you have a cool basement, perhaps these bags could work for you, but if you don't, you're probably better off just buying a couple of plastic buckets and keeping your onions and potatoes in the closet or cabinet."
4,"For Banjos, will need to order an adaptor","Two caveats for Banjos use: For the standard 1/4"" nuts used on most banjos, you will need to order ""Adapter for Regal Drum-Torque Tool"" (fits specifically 1/4-inch socket)- offered by Janet Davis Music Company, which is currently the only place I have found it available. Also, if your banjo uses ball-end nuts, this will still not fit.But for banjos that have hex nuts, I really have found it to be quite useful. Before I was just tensioning the head by feel, which isn't very precise. :p The Drum Torque takes the guess work right out; just tension to the desired amount (7 - 10 is the usual range for banjo heads), and done!4 stars however for the fact that I still had to search for and order an additional $17.95 adapter... which seems really overpriced, but I already had the Drum Torque, so what could I do?"
5,Dr. Bob Rocks!,"... and this set is a must-own for any golfer insteresting in improving ... until this stuff becomes natural and intuititve, it is very useful to re-visit these CD's from time to time to refresh the topics being presented ... to be honest, I wasn't impressed with The Golf Of Your Dreams (it seemed like a whole CD that only said ""get a coach and get serious""), but the other three make this package worth every penny, and then some! Highly recommended! Cheers to all ..."
4,Great for Lazy readers like myself,"Nice package, the only reason why I haven't given it a 5 star is because it doesn't read the book work for word. I have putting out of your mind hardcopy and It misses some things out from the book. But other than that its great. I listen to it while i am driving, makes a good change from music and you learn something new every time you listen. This will help your golf game and how you think about the game and how to practice."
3,More for pro's and scratch golfers,"I purchased this cd set to improve my mental game and although it helped somewhat, it left me feeling very inferior to the folks he talks about and the stories he tells. Its definitely for the advanced golfers. He talks about players with handicaps from 12 down to scratch."
3,golfer physcology,"The content of the cd's is good. Lots of antidotal stories. Expected more thought provoking ideas than was presented. Plastic cases the the cd's came were mostly destroyed in shipping, really poor packaging. trying to contact supplier to lodge a complaint was not very easy. Would have to really want something to go through the procedure again."
3,Da aaasaaaaaaaaalchemist,New old never released stuff pretty dope well worth the price. Something to blast thru the jL audio speakers.
4,Good Mix,This Cd is just a mixture of other songs if you collected his albums before. I love it still and the 2 bonus songs you can not locate no where else unless you do purchase the cd. I would definitely reccomend to add to your music.
5,Walking multiple dogs is a breeze!,I walk 5 dogs and thought my only option was to have them all on their own leash. And with this method we were constantly stopping to untangle the mess. Someone saw me one day and suggested these couplers. HOLY HAIRBALLS has it ever changed our walks! Now there's no tangling and a LOT less stress for everybody! This thing is a miracle. I use a 3-way for my 3 little ones and a 2-way for my 2 big ones and life is EXTREMELY GOOD!!
4,great coupler,"It is a great piece of equipment. I hooked my older dog and a 3month old puppy on it. the puppy was walking and leading with the other dog , with no problems with in 2 days."
4,Quick way to be able to view panoramas,I like this frame because it is very easy to change panoramic pics. The acrylic is thick and well polished. What is also helpful is two photos can be placed back to back. I have a stormy and sunny view of the same scene. I can just twist the frame and I can change my mood!!! Two cons - the magnets are weak so if handled roughly the sides move; and it is a little pricey.
3,Photo frame,"The frame is exactly as it shows in the picture. The only things I didn't like was one, you can see the small magnets holding it together and two, it sits totally flat so the picture has to sit on a high shelf otherwise it looks like it's leaning forward."
3,Nice but not worth the $$,"This is a very nice picture frame, but you can get an almost identical frame at Bed Bath and Beyond or Michael's for less than half the $$ (~$10). I recommend the frame but not at this price."
4,Magnet Frame by Canetti,I imagined that this frame would be able to hold a 5X7 photo with the acrylic border around it but it is what it says it is! 5X7 means 5X7 so you can put a 4X6 inside to allow for the acrylic to act as a frame. I really like it!
5,The perfect thing,"I needed to replace shoelaces in a 5-eyelet child's shoe -- the 45"" laces were perfect -- enough length for double knots."
1,Not good,"I am disappointed to receive my laces and see that they aren't white. So now I'm back at the website and I see that what I ordered was actually called 'natural'. The picture made them look white, so I ordered them, period. I should have checked the writing as well. Also I've noticed that there are actually no true white laces on the 'athletic shoe', flat lace section. Who woulda thought??? You know? So when I scrolled through the colors which aren't clear by the small pics, I found what looked like white in the enlarged picture. Mistake. I don't know - just sort of misleading in passive way. Surely the owners know they don't sell white and that many people want white..."
5,shoe laces for ice skates,I bought these shoe laces to lace up an old pair of ice skates that I had painted a bright shiny red for Christmas decorating. The skates turned out beautiful and needed some pretty white laces that were long enough to lace up and still be able to tie together for hanging. This product was perfect.
5,Fast Shipper!!!,I was pleased with the quality of the shoelaces but most of all the quick delivery time!
5,Great Laces,What can I say about a pair of shoelaces...they are the right size and color...they are fabulous! lolJerry Cifaldi
5,perfect laces for Chuck Taylor's,I was looking for a shoelace that matched the quality of my original Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes and these worked perfectly. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality flat lace.
2,Should have bought the $2 laces instead,"Inferior quality to original laces on my Adidas Adi Racers; these are excessively plastic-y and too thick. I paid nearly $[...] shipped, when I could have gotten equivalent (these are very low-end) laces for $[...] with free shipping via Prime. I expected better laces based on the premium and the pictures and am really disappointed."
5,An eye-opening experience,"Until I read 'Chechnya Diary' I was willing to accept what seemed to be conventional wisdom about the conflict in Chechnya--i.e., just another incidence of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. Mr. Goltz provides another view: i.e., an effort (at least initally) to restore to a displaced people the homeland of which they were deprived by the Stalinst regime. I also found it refreshing to read something by a journalist who is willing to acknowledge that his presence may have an impact on the turn of events. All in all, I think this is a most enlightening book and, like Mr. Goltz's 'Azerbaijan Diary', a terrific adventure story."
5,"A great read, even for non history buffs","Though a true story, laden with facts and names, Chechnya Diary by Thomas Goltz reads much more like a novel than other first person accounts of historical events. Goltz focuses much more on the personal side of the war, that of the Russians, Chechens, and most importantly, himself. The book becomes a point of philosophical reasoning that any person can relate to, war correspondent or not. Despite its factual, dry beginning, the book becomes a small window into the people affected by war, and how one small town copes with its many horrific problems."
5,"Bosworth shows how to ""help the buyer buy"" intelligenly.","It helps the seller to sell like an artist showing him how to find the critical issue, so he can resolve it, with his product or service. Or design a Solution. It is a powerful set of tools that ends with the sales by pressure and helps the seller to create long term relationaships."
5,specific buyer perspective,"I like detailed analysis of buyer's behaviour and his way of thinking, it is a good guide for sales people and managers"
4,Excellent for micro tactics in a solution sale.,"This book goes hand in hand with Spin Selling - Neil Rackman and Strategic Selling - Miller Hienman. It gives you the tools for day to day operations in a complex sale. Some of the parts are a little tedious such as the nine box model, however other tools such as sample cold calling techniques, creating a vision, diagnosing with a bias are all very relevant and have given me alot of help learning to be a stronger business development manager. Overall i highly recommend this book as one the cornerstone readings to achieving solution sales success."
4,Every Sales person should read this book,Every Sales person should read this book. Although most of the topics are known out of other trainings and so on this book is a very good refresher and summary of the key elements of professional selling techniques.
5,Outstanding! The go-to guide to complex sales,This is one of the best Sales books I have read! Simply outstanding - the go-to guide for complex sales. We use it routinely at our company to close business.
5,The standard in high value selling,"I read the book the first time for enjoyment. Then I read it again to help me start implementing solution selling. If you sell high value high dollar software or services this is a must read. In fact, I work with several sales people in my company that use the techniques in this book and they have been extremely successful. The book is easy to follow and you will notice changes right away if you implement solution selling. It is really focused on controlling the buying process."
3,As advertised.,"These were a good buy for the price, but ran down all too soon. There are ""ultimate"" alkaline batteries on the market today that would outlast the whole package."
3,Good Film,"heavy material, but a worth while film if you like great performances. the dvd was cheap so picked it up, thanks!"
4,Great movie,"This VHS tape of "" THIS BOYS LIFE"" is a good movie. Leonardo Dicaprio was so young in this movie but he was a good actor then also. Robert Dinero is a mean step-father that comes into his life and treats him badly. It's set back in the 50's and some of the music in it is good. It's well worth watching! Good movie!!"
5,Excellent movie.,"DeNiro is awesome in the role of Dwight, a small town, small minded, insecure, blue collar step dad. He plays the role perfectly and is just so believable. Leonardo DeCaprio is great as Toby, the step son who clashes with Dwight regularly. The story line is great. Just a all around thumbs up movie."
5,I think this movie is great!,I saw this movie on TNT a couple of months ago and I liked it. It wasn't boring at all. I think this is a great movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro were great. I watch it alot everytime when it comes on. It's a good movie!
3,looking for soundtrack info,"i liked this movie bobby d. was real erie...but i really liked the soundtrack and unforunately theres no soundtrack available,,but one song in particular is ""wild one"", a guy named iggy pop remade it but i would like to know who did it on this film, any help would be nice, no i dont own the film..."
3,"Oh , he had it so hard?!","The young boy has an abusive step father and lives in a small Washington state town.The late 50's early 60's weren't easy to grow up in, butactually were pretty good times compared to the 30's.The movie has the boy behaving badly because he doesn't havea good male role model?I think that saying he got ahead even while cheating and lyingmay not be sending a good message? Other people actually work hardin high school and get the grades he created for himself.There is no doubt that Tobias Wolff got a bad break in starting his life off,but he managed to put it back together with later hard work?Most people never get a novel published about their livesand then, a movie made of it."
1,True Dramatized Story,"I was quite sad after finishing the book ""This Boy's Life"" because it was such a well written book about times past and innocence lost. I rushed to rent the movie from Blockbusters and was quite disappointed. Many details were missing and some were overly dramatized, such as the scene of the wedding night between Dwight and Toby's mother. Call me old timer, if you want, but I thought it was unnecessary to be so graphic since the book certainly didn't give the details of sodomy, although I should have expected it in Hollywood productions.The book was far better. I don't suppose movies can quite capture the details of a book, perhaps only its essence. I must say the movie captures the essense well.Also, it was listed as a True Story in the beginning of the movie. It should have been called True Dramatized Story instead."
1,it should be 0 stars,this was the worst movie i had ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The best and funniest child abuse movie around,"You will be dry gulched by the performance of Robert De Niro in this classic tail of a harlot mother who drags her son from town to town. Leo Decaprio play Jack the harlots son who starts out wanting to do well but because of the bums his mom keeps selling her self to he heads on a spiraling path towards juvenile delinquency.That all takes place in the first half an hour of the film when Jacks saving grace enters the picture, played by Robert De Niro. This role was perfict for De Niro, being a manipulative two faced dirt bag named Dewight. Dewight continues to make Jacks life more and more miserable with every day through the clever use of verble abuse which made me really laugh and violence that would normaly turn the stomach but here it just made every thing that much better.So if you are looking for a funny true to life movie about [the in a cruddy little town, then this is your movie. I laughed and laughed and laughed."
5,Classic Leo DiCaprio,Love any movie with Leo! He is just an awesome actor and this movie is the start of his unbelievable acting career!
4,"A ""Concrete"" Prison","How inspired would you be if a town called Concrete (Washington State) were suddenly your new home? That's where single mom Caroline (Barkin) and her teenage boy Jack (DiCaprio) land, seeking a fresh start. And this time, she's determined to make her marriage work.Based on a true story, Caroline meets Dwight (De Niro), who apparently offers stability, steady pay and a father figure for Jack. They move in to Dwight's house although he has a wedding night surprise for Caroline.Dwight immediately begins to mentor Jack through Boy Scouts, a paper route and boxing lessons. Despite good intentions, Dwight begins to reveal himself as a loud, selfish and crude man who uses such slang as ""road apples"" and ""shut your pie hole."" Dwight continues to goad and humiliate Jack until the teen learns that an odd friend he's made may be able to phony up his test scores just enough to be admitted to a distant school. But Caroline's and Jack's actual escape turns out to be quite a bit more violent."
3,Disappointed,"My wife liked the Dahlia necklace I got her last year so much, that I ordered her another one this year. Very disappointed! First of all it was shorter than 16 inches, so it didn't fit as I expected. Plus, the color wasn't that impressive. Almost looked white. Needless to say, this will be the last Dahlia Christmas pearl necklace. What a shame :("
2,"Beautiful, but disappointing","Though I've been sewing for more than thirty years, I had great trouble with the frustrating and confusing sewing directions in this book. It's a beautiful book, full of ideas, but anyone without considerable sewing experience would be stumped. The author places too much emphasis on designer ideas and too little on practical instructions. I wasn't looking for ""wearable art,"" but for bags which were useful, durable, and good looking. Far better for those purposes is Nancy Restuccia's book ""Hold It! How to Sew Bags, Totes, Duffels, Pouches & More."" Ms. Restuccia gives careful, easy-to-follow directions, clear drawings supplemented by photos, and resources for finding materials and hardware to complete the projects in the book. Without Ms. Restuccia's book as a supplement, I couldn't have made any sense out of this book. It's a pretty book, but not for the real world."
5,Pickford's Best!,"This 1922 remake of the 1914 version is far superior, and my favourite Pickford. Mary moves effortlessly from mischief, to humour, to eye watering scenes and shows why she was perhaps the greatest star of the silent era. The cinematography is fabulous, as is the orchestral score. A must have DVD"
2,"stunning imagery, but...","Yes, the footage is stunning, huge and colorful. However, the presentation of information is not really compelling. The topic is interesting, but what's its relationship to everything else? I was disappointed. If you're a teacher, and you're teaching about volcanoes, this is a good one for one period, because it's short. But actually not that thought-provoking. For my money, I'd still prefer to show Dante's Peak, even though the filmmakers have taken some artistic license to tell the story."
1,All show not much substance.,"end of movie stated made in 1991. Not informative about the volcano's or the ring of fire, other than in general. the footage is good (by today standards) but doesn't seem to move from point to point without engaging the audience. The only part that came close was the Indonesian culture connection to the volcano. a large part of the film tries to show the different culture effects of earthquake (wait wasn't this about volcanoes only?) and volcanoes on the local population, for USA baseball?? Pass it up unless you want to see some footage of different volcanoes around the world, but they are basic footage."
5,High on the list to read,Higher documents an important part of NYC history along with the egos of men in positions to exert their power.
3,"Engaging, but...","I certainly enjoyed _Higher_, but it could have been a better book. Bascomb needs an editor: usages are awkward, some of the passages read as though they were padding added to a slimmer first version, and when the author steps back to sketch the bigger picture the prose, all too often, turns purple. Not altogether his fault: too many authors today try to write a movie rather than a book. Oddly, for a book about architecture and the construction of specific buildings, there are surprisingly few photos -- not that I expected or wanted a coffee table book, but the very visual story here could have been better illustrated. Those of us who like this sort of book, and I do, despite the quibbling and caviling above, should also read Daniel Okrent's _Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center_, which is every bit as interesting and a better-written book, all in all."
3,Ehh...,"So I got these new Nanoweb strings for my CF Martin Acoustic guitar. I was expecting them to be at least up to par with the Martin SP+ that I currently had on it, well I was wrong. Sure, they have less screech when sliding up and down the fret board, but they sound just down right tinny! You could just as easy add some fret glide to your guitar and get great sound out of the guitar..."
5,Awesome strings!!,"These strings make me want to play my guitar more. Clean, crisp, nice on the fingers, and even nice looking."
1,Dissapointing...,"I can't say too many good things about these strings. Their tone supposedly lasts longer, but the tone downright sucks to begin with. If you are picky about good tone like me, you will hate these strings. Also, at first they feel EXTREMELY slippery when played - some people may like that but to me it's unbearable. Then, as they wear down and the coating starts to come off, they start to feel sticky."
5,Wonderful Trick Book from Penn and Teller,"This book IS a collection of stories, just not science fiction stories. They're written by those bad-boys of magic Penn & Teller.By looking at where the 'author' comes from you can see who wrote each story:New England - PennAnywhere Else - TellerThe book was originally part of a ""cheat pack"" included in the book ""Penn & Teller's Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends"" and is gimicked.The actual stories in this collection are definitely worth reading, just as soon as you've worked out the gimick.Clever and interesting - would recommend."
2,Pretty beat up,"I know this was a used unit , but it came filthy dirty, one foot pad broken off , packaged very poorly. How hard would it have been to at least clean it up. At least it seems to function properly, but very disappointing."
1,Etronics-horrible experience,"Product arrived damanaged via UPS on June 2. Amazon arranged a pick up for product to go back to Etronics. After 5 weeks of e-mails and telephone calls Etronics threw in the towel and ordered a refund. I went to Circuit City, talked to a knowledgable sales rep and got a better product for same amount of money. Buying electonics on the internet is a mistake. You save no money after you figure the shipping."
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Watched - I Want My Brain Cells Back,"This appears to have been a pilot for a television series that wasn't picked up and then turned into a movie. The premise is that a Judge chooses from his court files people and cases that can serve as life lessons for the viewers. In this morality play, the Judge chooses the case of a rich criminal defense lawyer who misuses his law license by defending people accused of crimes (aka the scum of the earth). There is not a single thing about this movie that makes it worth watching. From the repulsive characters, to the hammy acting, to the inane plot that completely falls apart at the end, this movie is a one star stinker that should be avoided at all costs. I want my seventy minutes back!"
2,Very poor packaging,"The book was simply placed into a plastic bag and mailed. When it arrived, the mailman folded the package to fit it in the mailbox and the book was damaged along the backing. I had to place it under a heavy stack of books to get it to its correct form again."
3,Good book.,"Very good book, straight to the point. Good photography, but this is not a coffee table book. this book analyses the influence of the traditional in the architecture by some of the best architects, and does it well. Read it from beginning to end in two days, I am probably going back for another read."
1,I miss Tommy,"First off, Tommy Wisseu is not in this film at all. A real disappointment. Second the premise is, ""lets film a bunch of homeless people and call it a documentary."" Third, at times the picture goes out of focus because the camera guy can't figure out what he's doing. Fourth, the sound is terrible at times because they film under overpasses and in crowded areas and don't know how to filter it out in post production. And lastly the interviews contradict one another, a man says he is fine living on the street and sees no reason to go to a homeless shelter, then we cut to a woman who is probably an actress saying ""no one chooses to be homeless.""DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS IS NOT THE ROOM"
4,Homelessness Videos for children,"We have been searching for something on homelessness that would be appropriate to use with the children and their families at our church. Though it has some minor problems, it was by far the best video for our purposes."
4,Balmy breezy Island cookbook,"First purchased this book years ago, then did a cleanup of my house and got rid of it. Did I miss it! Delighted to replace it from Amazon. This is a delicious Caribbean cookbook with recipes from various islands (a favorite is a pernil pork roast from Jamaica), as well as numerous tropical drinks mostly rum-based, great for entertaining."
3,The stories - - -,"--- - - that precede Death in Venice are painful. I didn't even finish a few of them. Mann is really concerned with ""What is art?"" And what qualifies an artist in this commercial world."
5,Amazing,"This album is unbelieveable. Both ""Alphaville"" and ""Nightbird Song"" are incredible cuts, with Pavone holding down simple rock-like lines, and Chapin blazing away. ""The Roaring S"" features Sarin's drumming- amazing- and some fast lines from Chapin (bass flute, I think.) ""Changes Two Tyres"" is absolutely ridiculous, with Chapin playing unaccompanied at the end in a violent display of virtuosity- unreal. And ""Aeolus"". My favorite song. So simple, so beautiful, the last song Chapin ever played."
1,"Liars, don't buy from these people!!","these folks sent me a machine that didn't work and had no power cord. Luckily, I had a cord from a machine I had used previously for years. my kids loved the geo safari we used previous to buying this replacement from lil kate's closet. We were so excited to replace it. A huge disappointment when it didn't work.The communication from Lil Kate (Katie?) Closet was awful brief and suspect. I returned their defective computer, at my cost, and they didn't reimburse me for my purchase price or anything.Steer clear, these people are crooks."
3,scarfx silicone sheets work well,My scars do seem less red and raised after using this product. I dislike how quickly the strips wear out. The gel starts to pucker and gets less sticky. Ive been washing the strips and reusing them. Overall i like the results but wish the strips would stay sticker and not roll up and off the skin so quickly.
1,Gooey and lint gets stuck - expensive price is for only 1!,Did not like these. Too gummy like jelly on a rubber strip and lint gets embedded in it and it doesnt wash off like they say. Really expensive..3 months supply would cost about 300.00 if I use a new one every week because they get so dirt and it does not wash out so you have to use a new.I purchased ScarAway 6 weeks ago and the sheets wash off cleanly and I have seen great results already. ScarAway is a soft fabric with a silicone layer which feel nice on the skin and clothes glide over it without pulling off. I did not like the ScarFX because it was like rubber so it pulled under clothes and rolled off.
1,Pure drivel.,"This book is pure drivel, don't be fooled. If it's possible to put together a volume that has more self-aggrandizing and outright preposterous chapters I can't imagine who could pull it off. Take the chapter on Stephen Hawking as an example. Hawking states, ""You have to be creative to do science. Otherwise you're just repeating tired formulas. You aren't doing anything new."" Fair enough. The book's pseudo-analisys of this statement is the following,""Hawking deconstructs the universe. It is not his job to be creative, nor does he mean to be creative. He wants to understand creation."" Give me a break. The only use for this book, outside of an expensive and ugly drink coaster, is as an exercise in self-parody."
3,S.T.'s opinion review.,"i think this is a good thing to use when u play with your bratz dolls cause it can organize clothes well so u dont get yours and your friends bratz stuff mixed up but it isnt a toy so u cant rate it in fun.......but if your making a mall or something for your bratz then it could be atleast a 2 in fun like i rated it to be.thats all of my review. signed,S.T. KID"
3,Cute,I see the concept (maybe. There are inserts in the case that are designed to help the child organize and separate her dolls. But the insert are not at all sturdy. As soon as you open the case the insets fall out making the child frustrated at the same time. However the outside of the case is very sturdy and durable. cute item but it only serves the purpase as a toy and not a storage for the toys.
4,The Voice at the Door,"As a Southern Woman writer, Elizabeth Spencer explores the issues familiar to her during her childhood and her adult life in this intricate novel. Race, friendship, loyalty, secrecy, and contradiction all make this novel's characters come alive in a way I have seldom experienced in a first-time read. Spencer completely sucked me in and wrapped me up in her plot. I thought it was fabulous, of the caliber of Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" It is a book I will enjoy picking up for the rest of my life."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I am not sure why, but I ordered this thinking it would be appropriate for my eleven-year-old daughter. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It is an autobiography and definitely written for an audience of people probably over eighteen. Personally, I skimmed through it and I think it will be kind of boring when, or if, I ever get around to trying to read it. It is okay to disagree with me. I am not the type of person who gets deeply involved in biographies or autobiographies unless it is someone whom I have a deep interest in. Others may have differing opinions than mine on this book and that is okay with me."
4,Nice Memoir about Not just a Writer but a Woman Growing UP,"Even before I realized that Marianne Gingher was from NC (my home state) I was a fan of ""Bobby Rex's Greatest Hit."" As a fan, and a writer, I really wanted to read her memoir.The title of this memoir is apt. Gingher proceeds to describe the life that, I think, most of the world lives--simple but not at all unimportant.This memoir takes us through her chldhood with horses, boys and even weddings she was in as a child and her own.Gingher's style is easy to read but yet filled with wonderful turns of phrase. Even if you aren't a writer, I think you will find this memoir interesting and possibly uplifting.I like to collect quotes but I had a hard time narrowing down which one I wanted to use. I finally decided on this from page 73, ""Lack of proof gives one creative latitude. But a writer remembers the past with a memory that is stored with the self-serving loopholes of revision."""
2,Blaahhhh......,"I found this book amazingly trite. To me, most of the episodes sounded like they came out of a Hallmark TV movie. Furthermore, her memoirs were so boring! To write an autobiography, surely your life should have been more interesting than this? Ms. Gingher has had a nice life and through the book it is obvious that she is very pleased with it. Her life, however does not merit an entire book nor the reader's time."
3,Wonderful Stories - Poor Editing,"I have read all three of the volumes in this collection. I must say that this collection is so poorly edited, that I find it impossible to believe that it was edited at all.The excellence of Matheson's work has caused it to be melded into the very culture of America. Some of the stories here were adapted to serve as episodes of the television series, Amazing Stories, Night Gallery, and the Twilight Zone.The poor editing of this collection, or, rather, the lack of editing, certainly does not pay a worthy tribute to such a great and culturally significant writer."
3,Satisfactory.. but it's a shame,"After finishing this book I felt disappointed. I wanted to like it and it was recommended by someone that I value their opinion. I think the problem was I just finished ""Prophet of Innovation: Joseph Schumpeter and Creative Destruction"" and that is an absolutely great book. This book was boring in spots and didn't explain enough of Keynes ideas. If you want to read a great book on economists, please read the book I just mentioned. I'm disappointed in the one but it just has too many issues to warrant a higher recommendation."
5,Good Guys Rule!,"Finally, someone puts Hollywood in its place! This book correctly illustrates how a bunch of weirdoes in Hollywood do NOT control the world. Normal, God fearing people win out in the end. It is very refreshing and tremendously funny. I loved reading this book!I recommend this book to any American who wants to move to France."
4,Really Funny Book,"Having some experience in the movie industry (bit actor/producer)I was pleasantly surprised by how close this came to some of my own experiences. I must admit I laughed out loud at various times as I read the book. It is about a couple of investment bankers sent to Hollywood by their firm to see what happened to some money they raised for a studio. The adventures and kooks these guys meet are hilarious, and it isn't too hard to figure out who is being parodied. This book was seemingly written from a political perspective totally at odds with Hollywood, and it is quite refreshing. I found it funny, although a little too short."
5,Dude this movie is hooot!,I love this show. It can not get better than this. And 009 looks soo hooot. I wish I had a boyfriend like him. Any way great animation looove it.
1,What a shame!,"This movie is well-known among the Japanese fans of the greatmanga series ""Cyborg 009"" because of its nonsense.This turkey is nothing but a shame in the history of ""Cyborg 009""series. Please notice that his film has nothing to do withthe TV anime series which was popular in Japan."
2,too bland for sci-fi anime,"A band of nine cyborgs, each with a special ability launch into space...and don't do much of anything. Too boring for kids and too shallow for adults. This turkey goes nowhere."
4,Clever and Funny,"If you like humor that is just a bit off-beat and bizarre, you will probably enjoy this film. It's classic Plympton, but the songs are good and there are actually a few clever insights about people mixed in, if you need intellectually redeeming qualities. I would not put much stock in the Charles Solomon review, which to my way of thinking missed every point in the film. For example, the hero does not go around listening to ""people singing various songs--which he takes and passes off as own."" Rather, he talks to people, and hears songs in the way they speak and act. Sort of a comment on the artistic process, I suppose. But mostly the movie is just funny. The animation is sort of like Monty Python animation, in that it is very simple, a bit twisted, funny and full of surprises. I watch this film over and over, each time wondering what make Plympton think of this stuff."
4,Plympton for ALL Ages,"Bill Plympton's hand-drawn colored pencil cartoons are a joy to look at, and very funny with their multitudes of visual puns. But unfortunately most of his films are really for more mature audiences than can be shown in a classroom setting. This is the one DVD of Plympton's that is entirely appropriate for young audiences. Kids like the silly songs and weird roaming story. It is also an excellent example of economizing animation production with cycles and ""moving holds."" I wish they would package it with his short film ""Your Face"" which is also great for kids as an example of how animation can be used to change something normal --a face-- into a million variations of funny and strange."
5,A good analysis of the UFO phoenomenon along with mythology and religion,"John Keel is remarkable in how he analyzes the information regarding UFO encounters. The scariest thing is that I have read esoteric literature that explains the same exact conclusion that he came up to: We are ""property"" of some ""higher level beings"".You may think I am crazy, but if you read this book along with his other books, you will see that the clues point to something more nefarious than expected."
3,"NSA Operation: It's not aliens,it's the great cosmic educator(God)","This book was required reading for all ""project blue book"" investigators.It was part of their ""religious"" indoctrination.The idea being that they knew the ""secret""; that God is""real""and the ""alien technology"" we see flying around us is actually ""Him"" educating us by showing us examples of what to aspire to.ie:space travel"
5,They did that all...,"You now how dreams excists, well they project those ""movies"" into your mind...(No Starz)"
4,Works Just Fine,"I installed this on an ABit K7NS-Ultra MOBO that is already water cooled via the Zalman Reservator1. I have my video card cooled by the same system, and the processor(AMD XP3000) is overclocked 500MHz. I have 4 sticks of ram in the 4 sockets, and I have no problems with this hunk of aluminum in place of the fan that was stock. It has been about a year now since I installed it, and still no problems even though I have this running 24hrs a day on average 5 days a week since the install."
1,Don't waste your money on 8th edition,"I had great hopes for the 8th edition as I have used previous editions a lot. What a letdown this new edition is. A total diversion from previous editions, it only list one vintage year (the most recent one) for each wine!!! This book is a compiled list of all wines reviewed by the Wine Spectator in the last year ONLY. If that is of interest to you, go right ahead, spend your money and be happy. I would rather try to obtain an older edition if you want a reference to use as comparisons. Or/and by Parker's Wine buying guide which is far, far superior."
1,Rubbish,"In this eighth edition:1. Review is for one vintage only for each wine.2. The covered vintage is not the newest nor the best nor the typical one, eg. Penfolds Bin 128 has review on vintage 2001 in WS's web site but only year 2000 was covered in the book. Even Chateau Latour, only 2001 was in the book. I just can't see any real use of it.3. The only ""good"" thing is the ""big"" font which should be good for short-sighters."
1,I was fooled!,"Wine Speclulator does a nice job of reviewing wines. However, in the past they have created a comprehensive listing of ratings for vertical vintages of a variety of wines. It was called ""Wine Spectator's Ultimate Guide to Buying Wine"". In this eighth edition, they have only included the scores and tasting notes of current vintages.If you are looking for past ratings, they want you to join their website and pay for it. This is fine, but don't be fooled like me and think you are getting the past ratings when purchasing this book.I am really disappointed!I am going back to Robert Parker for my wine news. He does a nice objective job, and is regarded by my peers as a higher authority than ""Wine Speculator"" anyhow.Oh, and my peers include a Master Sommelier, and two Advanced Sommeliers with the British Guild of Master Sommeliers.J.R. PHX, AZ"
1,New format ruins what was a great book,"What a shame when a new format turns what was once a fairly encyclopedic wine guide into a rehash of the last years reviews. Having purchased editions 5, 6, and 7 I was eagerly waiting for the release of the 8th edition. It was stunningly disappointing.What is worse is that the first reviews on Amazon must have been for earlier editions as they still listed ""Over 40,000 wines reviewed"". Misleading to say the least.I'm returning mine as defective and will not purchase it again unless they go back to the old format."
2,How do you quantify dissapointment on a 100-point scale?,"Wine Spectator magazine's latest book is primarily a list of scores for each of the wines they've reviewed over the last several years. The book provides little general background on wine flavors, styles, and appellations. For instance, the introduction to the section on France discusses Burgundy's key white wine districts without mentioning Chablis! The book's largest section is the alphabetical listing of producers and the scores for each of their wines. The French section is not sorted by appellation making it very difficult for use in any purchase planning. The comprehensive list of wine scores would be valuable at the wine shop. But the book is too big to carry. The only use I can think of for this book would be to check on your wine's score after you get home from the wine shop."
2,Nothing like previous editions !,"I was VERY disappointed in the 8th edition of the Ultimate Guide to Buying Wine. I had used the previous seven editions extensively, but this edition will be of limited use to me. All other editions had included four or five vintages of the various wines produced by wineries. The 8th edition has short descriptions of only one vintage of each wine released by the wineries....and that is not very current. It appears that these evaluations were lifted directly from the Wine Spectator's monthly ratings from a couple of years ago. I will not purchase this once helpful tool if this format is continued in the next edition."
5,An excellent comprehensive resource,"I've had a copy of this book since it was published in late 1998. All I can say is that it's a tremendous resource which I've thoroughly enjoyed using. I marvel at the accuracy of its descriptions. I've used it to ""do my homework"" before shopping at wine sales. I've used it to help determine when to drink the wines I have accumulated. Above all, I've derived great pleasure from just reading the entries.My hat is off to the Wine Spectator for this guide and my hope is the next edition is soon on the way."
3,Great book - if you don't have access to their web site,"This is a handy reference with tasting note and prices for many wines but there are some glaring holes. In many cases there are WS tasting notes available but they don't make it into the book, in other cases there are multiple entries over a period of time but only the latest is in the book. .......Don't get me wrong, I love the book - its just a shame it wasn't more complete."
1,A new format that is not as useful,"Past issues of the Wine Spectator Ultimate Guide included all of the past vintages for each wine listed. This one is departure from that, and only covers a short window (couple of years) for each wine. If I had know that I wouldn't have bought it."
5,Hoyt Axton's Best Stuff,"Absolutely my most played favorite CD. With a lead song about a cat named Kalamazo you know it doesn't get any better. I bought this just to have a second copy on hand. Great, great stuff....."
2,money power for singles,this book is show the correct way to balance you income. I have have since read this book made my life easier while making money.
4,Let's eat Dessert !,'Lessons in Seduction' by Sara Bennett was a very good historical mystery romance novel. Vivianna Greentree goes to London to save her orphanage from Oliver Montegomery. Vivianna decides to seduce Oliver. There are many twist and turns and over all this was a very good novel. I plan to read more of Sara Bennett novels.
1,Never made it past the second chapter....,"I gave up on page 30 and just quit reading. The heroine came across as a silly, flighty little girl and I just could not take anything she said or did seriously. I couldn't force myself to keep reading."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this book because of the good reviews. I read it last week (i.e. less than 7 days ago) already I couldn't remember anything about the story even to the extend the names of the hero! It is so forgettable that I feel I had wasted 4 hours of my life reading it. Could I demand a refund on my time, please? I gave this book 2 stars only because I am a sucker for the Lylic colour on the cover."
3,"A Fresh perspective, but only one perspective.","Stefan Betke's latest dubbed-out offering of re-organised clicks and pops succeeds by challenging our notions of what constitutes ""legitimate"" musical source. The overall sound picture is even less tonal than conventional dub and the album makes up for this by means of its novel textures, which give rise to innovative interplay between rhythmic elements. However, the same cannot be said for the melodic and harmonic ends of the scale, and sitting through an entire album's worth of such a limited sonic perspective can be quite trying."
3,"blue, red and now yellow","Pole is back. After the first Blue album followed the red one, and now here it is the third and yellow cd of the german avant-dub, if this doesn't sound too strange, creator. Nothing new, but that's not bad when talking about someone so talented like Stefan Betke. Those who already know him won't be disapointed, and those who haven't heard Pole yet will discover how digital abstraction, experimental electronic and, of course, dub became a single marvelous thing."
1,A steaming pile of recycled cliches.,A child could write a better book by clipping random words from the newspaper and pasting them into a journal. Beyond unhelpful. Reading the back covers of *real* books on the interviewing process would be more productive. In case I'm being too vague for anyone out there... don't waste your money.
5,New Thrower & No Snow,White Outdoor 8.5 HP Tecumseh Two Stage Snow Thrower #31AH6GLF790The one thing nice about the machine is the day we received it the snow stopped. Likes good for the winter of 2008. It was delivered on time & was easy to track on the way to Oregon.
2,Dion goes lounge !,"This is Dion's first album after he left Laurie, and he was the first Rock and Roller to be signed to the label. After his great run of hits on Laurie, he opened his account with Columbia with the stunning Ruby Baby, and I expected the album to be more of the same. What a dissapointment I got.He covers wimpy songs like End of the world and Go away little girl in a manner that makes Fankie Avalon seem macho. Then we get self pitying versions of standards like Mammy, You made me love you, which are unbelievably bad.Apart from three tracks, which are Ruby Baby, Gonna Make it Alone and Will love ever come my way, the rest of this album is either filler, or wimpy rubbish.I would be wary of parting with over $25 for the Japanese import and wait for Columbia to do an American reissue, hopefully with the Donna the Prima Donna album which is magnificant is comparison.Mike"
3,"good, but not alone","You can't read just one of the first three alone, but there is a tremendous amount of complete sections repeated over and over again in books two and then three. I wonder if she'll have space for anything new at all in the next book in the series? This is a pleasant read, but needs a LOT of editing."
2,"Interesting plot, but writing was flat and uninteresting","I read the first two books awhile back and liked the plot but the writing stlye put me to sleep. The author does not know how to keep the book interesting. The characters were flat uninteresting. When I heard there was a third book, I decided to give the series another try. The third book stank worse than the first two. The only reason that I kept reading was because I forced myself. With a different author, the story might have actually gone somewhere else besides back to the bookstore. Dull, lacked polish, and was just plain terrible."
4,Just the text,"The work itself is a great read; however, I wish there were some footnotes or endnotes to provide some background for the text. I would recommend another version such as the Oxford edition, which has extensive notes."
1,Lytton Strachey is rolling in his grave.,This Wilder Publications edition of Eminent Victorians is the most poorly edited mess I have ever stopped reading. Gayle Turner
2,love the book but numerous publishing errors,"This is a really terrific book to read, just not this version. Strachey gets 5 stars. But I really have to complain about the poor quality of the book itself. A prodigious number of typos (at least one on every page), one page left entirely blank, and lousy glued paper binding really mar the experience."
2,Don't Waste Your Money !,"I bought this for my son while we were out welcoming daddy home from Iraq.Up to 25 lbs my behind.. My son was more like 16 lbs and the thing wouldn't swing. I would have it on high and it would barely budge. He hated it. And he loves swings.Also the animals that are supposed to hang off the banana leaf don't hang on. They constantly fell off.And like the other person said, he was too tall for it at 4 months old.It did make cute noises but that is all of the compliments I have for it.The Aquarium swings are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better in my point of view . ."
3,Decent,"Like many others, we bought this swing to take with us to the grandparents and to have something we could easily move from room to room in our house. Our four month old daughter is pretty squirmy, but we've had no concerns about her safety as long as she is buckled in. She likes the motion and the music and easily falls asleep in it. It's very decent, but not amazing.My complaints about the piece are:The legs don't lock in when the swing is folded and it makes it difficult to carry.The parrot and frog on the mobile section fall off easily. We've had to tape them on.It didn't take long for my daughter to be completely bored with the parrot and frog. It would be nice in future versions if they could incorporate the rings that allow different toys to be swapped in and out."
3,OK,"Like the other person said, the swing is pretty much horizontal and cannot be adjusted. The mobile is pretty boring. Love the size and portability of it though. It says it's made for babies up to 25lbs but kid is only 13lbs and she's almost too long to be in it so unless your baby is really short and chubby it won't last that long. Cute colors and music."
3,Cute for little little babies,"We got the swing as a baby shower gift, and have used it a lot for our 3 month old daughter. It swings really slowly (due to her weight), and she's still just under 12 pounds. It did work great for her when she was really little, but her head can flop over to the side, so that her ear rests on her shoulder/chest, so she's not real secure in it. We keep her propped with washcloths under the headrest to keep her little head in place if she's sleeping. It's really good with portability, and is a decent value for the price, but I'm sure there are much better/longer usability models out there..."
5,Work Well With H50 Water cooler,These WILL FIT a H50 water Cooler. Buy them for Push-Pull config. Increased my cooling at little cost to me.
1,Not good for Podcasting,"I was excited about this microphone but found that it was not good for my type of podcasting/vodcasting/screen casting. You have to be almost eating the mic to get any sound recorded. Very irritating! I was under the impression that a condenser mic did not require the proximity of the other types of professional mics but was apparently wrong. The quality is good if you can keep your mouth touching the mic. Also, the support information on the Samson page is not good. You select the type of mic and then it sends you to the users manual! Weird...Plug and play, yes, BUT with what quality? I've had the same experience with MAC and PC, have adjusted the volume up to the max on both, and am ready to put this one in the drawer. A waste of $100."
3,Not what I thought it would be,Well I got the microphone and did exactly what the directions said. It said I didnt need no additional products for use. Turns out I need to buy a Sound Card in order to use my mic. I think the company should have been a little more specific on which laptops and Windows program it works best on! I have windows vista and everything is installed correctly but when i plug in the mic I get no sound! If you want to give yourself a headache with this product by all means go for it as for me I'm disappointed and I'm returning the product immediately
3,My Review,"I got the mic from Amazon because it was the best price anywhere on the internet. Excited when it came, I later came to find out it was not compatible with my laptop because the soundcard did not support it. I returned the item, simple as that."
1,Trouble,"I spent today testing out my mics in preperation of a recording session. Believe me, you don't want to bother with this mic. Some day last week I tried to use it for its advertised application ""recording on the road"". I ran it into Audacity, with poor results (i.e. everything was balanced to the right, and the left was only static). Today on the test I ran it into Cubase docked in my home studio. After flipping through pages of manuals and .pdfs I finally got it to work...with a two second delay! If it were offered to me for free again and they said I'd only have to pay shipping, I'd say no thanks. Not worth it."
3,Ok.,I was really excited when my package was finally delivered. When I opened it I saw the mic wasnt in bad condition but it was ok. I was going to test it out when I realize there was no USB chord that came with it :( therefore I give you 3 stars.
1,horrible,"when i received this item, I quickly opened it to test it out. When I connected it to my laptop, my computer said the microphone was malfunctioning. Therefore, I looked on google to see if i could fix the problem, i discovered that my windows 7 laptop did not supply enough power. so now i have to buy a external usb to give it more power but im not so sure because i got it working one time and the mic was either too low or it was just not functioning. so i disconnected it again then reconnected it. my computer again same problem, was unable to pick it up or in other words identify what it was, install the mic for use. so i still have not tested it for quality which is bull."
1,Fatally incompatible with Vista,"Do NOT purchase this microphone if you are using Windows Vista. In some cases, the gain is incredibly low, and for some folks (myself included) the microphone will pick up only the loudest sound, even with the gain turned up to maximum. Save yourself the hassle and get something else."
3,Microphone,"Very good mic, although when i last recorded with it, sound only picked up on the left side. Overall good product though."
5,Stellar,"Short and sweet this mic is great! Especially if you know even a little bit about audio. You can make this mic sound as good as mics that are 5x the cost with some simple EQ, reverb etc. If youve got nice physical hardware to run it through even better."
3,Not Mac Friendly,"I bought this microphone to improve my podcasts because my MacBook Pro internal mic was not up to par for podcasting. Firstly, the software that is included with this mic is not Mac compatible. Secondly, This mic only records in Mono, So when you record it in stereo it only records the left channel. But if you use this mic for Music, Skype, and Gameplay, its a great mic."
5,Great product,This is a terrific product to utilize if you are doing recordings like myself. It arrived quickly and was a great price.
2,NOT for LIVE recording!!!!!,"Although this mic has fantastic sound for the price, it is not meant to be used with live based music recording. The latency (delay) is very high! You can expect to hear anywhere from 1-4 seconds of silence before sound acctually goes through your speakers. This is very frustrating when trying to stay on ryhthm.DO NOT buy this mic if you are planning to use it with Ableton Live or similar software!!! It works, but at the expense of annoying delay."
5,Great mic! Almost too good,"Don't let my title completely fool you.This microphone has so much to offer! It worked right upon plugging in (to windows XP sp2). It has more gain than I'd personally ever need. It is definitely a ""flat"" coloring when recording. Its simply amazing for recording vocals, acoustic guitar, guitar amps, or even small percussion instruments. I do some mixing here at home for fun, not a true studio by any means, but its perfect for home recording, and certainly will deliver EP quality recordings. It has a very small sort of noise that is produced from the mic itself, possibly from the electronics or my computer, not sure which. Its relatively easy to tune out with a good equalizer.My only peeve is that I live near an interstate highway, and this thing picks it up clear as day (older mics I have don't). It in a sense has revealed how noisy my environment really is."
5,Received right away and works great!,This was sent out fast and we were very happy with the promptness and condition of the product.
2,"Sound quality ok, but",Bought C01U and was glad I could send it back after a testing period:Tried it witih Ableton Live on OS X 10.4.7 and a MacBookPro. Sound Quality was okay but either the buffer was too small (which caused the sound to scratch every few seconds) or the buffer was too large which ended in a lag causing me to get distracted from my monitor-earphones. I tried for about two hours to find the right balance but it didn't work out. This Microphone might have a nice sound but I can'T recommend it for high standard voice recording.
5,Super mic for home recording at low cost,The Samson USB Condensing Microphone has been a great recording tool for me using my laptop at home. I bought mine at MicroCenter for $80 two years ago and it is still working great. It records with crystal clarity and great volume levels which help keep the true sound without having to purchase a lot of extra recording equipment...which is not practical for my use (mostly home recording an online karoake). It has no software to install and is completely plug-n-play using only a USB port on any computer.Great find...highly recommended.
3,Good Mic,"I love to use this Mic when I was working on Win XP where you can use the add on Soft Pre software with this Mic, but after Vista and Windows7 it is not more possible , they did not updated the software and the recording quality is not what I need. This Mic works without any software at all but I am tired of jumping to the Control Panel and back to the the right volumes . It pick up everything , even the noises when you record instruments , record better male vocals as female . I give it 3 stars just because they did not updated the add-on software that this mic need so badly .I ordered new Audio technica mic that record crystal clear everything I need without any noises and have beautiful design and I guess it would be my number one for now . It works like that.. a microphone is so unique as your voice, one mic will not record all different vocals the same way , for one person it works for other it don't, it is important to find the right mic for you.."
2,Customer service pretty lacking.,"The microphone developed a crackling noise a few months after purchase, and customer service was no help in resolving the issue. They wouldn't even pick up the phone."
5,I like this product a lot,"I got this mic around a month ago and I like it a lot. It was a little confusing at first for me to get started but once I figured out the few things you have to do, I think it sounds great, and is not difficult to use. Those things are:(after the basic making sure that it is plugged in and the volume is on in the control panel), click the ""R"" button from the track 1 options (really obvious if you are looking at the software), then go to the left side of the screen and click on the tab that says input, indicating what you want to use to record. You click the ""Samson CO1U, 1 in, 1 out"" which will bring up either stereo, left, or right, and I was told to do left (1 in, 1 out) and that is what I have done, and it works. After this, you are ready to record. This may seem obvious, but it was not to me: the record button is towards the top of the screen, by the other buttons, like play, etc. It is shaped like a circle, like record usually is. I recommend this product."
5,Great on my Macbook!!,"Wow!! I'm studying production of radio and tv in the university and this Mic is excellent for the productions we have to do for school!! I have an intel based Mac (black one) and it works perfectly great. I use it with Sound Studio 3.5 and the sound is really great, no hiss or anything. Obvoiusly it will get some popping but that's what poppers are made for!!! It is actually great because my Mac deosn't have a Mic input so the USB port is a really good sollution. It is REALLY plug and play, don't have to open system preferences in order to use it (other users might not know how to use it)."
3,"Good For Speaking, Not For Singing","This mic has outstanding quality for spoken word, but if you are a musician and are looking for a good mic to record with this is not the one for you. It distorts the voice and does not do well recording guitar either. If you're looking to record music as I am, I recommend you keep looking."
3,Nice design but thin towels,"I ordered 7 of these towels as groomsmen gifts for my nautical themed wedding. I assumed from the picture and being Tommy Hilfiger that they would be a thicker towel. They are not. The colors/design are really nice and as it appears in the picture, but the back of the towel is white and they are very light-weight. Even though I got these on sale, I could get nautical themed towels without the ""Tommy Hilfiger"" for half of the sale cost at my local Target."
3,Cute towel,"The towel is cute but the stripes in the photo appear to be much closer together. I also expected it to be a little thicker. My daugher really likes it, we'll keep it since it was marked down and we had an Amazon gift certificate. It's a pretty good size as well, I can wrap it around my 3yr old several times."
2,Not a quality towel,"There were 2 SKU tags on the towel, one for the right design and one for the wrong. I was shipped the wrong one (same towel different color and picture). It is thin fabric and disappointing."
3,Could be better quality. . .,"I recently bought this towel in the ""Surfside"" pattern. Now I know why it cost less than most of the others.... this towel is not up to Tommy Hilfiger usual standards... it has shrunk one inch and it quite thin as one other reviewer has said. The edges are curling after only 3 washings."
1,No Absorbtion,Thin and more of a nylon feel than thick cotton. Tore very easily and felt more like a bed sheet
3,nice artwork,"quality and thickness is less than expected. artwork is nice. considering it came with a $40 price tag and i paid less than half, it is a good value."
3,Inflatable-Yes - but NOT WITH THAT PUMP....,"Great idea, nicely thought out in three inflatable sections, seem to be durable, but by the time you are done with the second section you have no energy left for the third one.This is a 2 days project to inflate, forget deflating it and taking it with you on a trip. Once was enough...Really too bad..."
2,Not Easy to Inflate,This is definately not an easy item to inflate as they profess. But anyway the kids love it.
4,slumber bed,I bought this for my 3 year old for when we travel.She loves it. The foot pump that comes with it takes awhile to fill it. The only complaint I have is that is loses air when she sleeps on it. Not alot thou.
2,Cute for the 2 days it lasted...,"This was given to my 3 year old daughter as a Christmas present. She loved it! The set up was easy... tedious... but easy. However, it can not hold up to the type of torture a toddler can put it through. The bed has a slow leak somewhere. I can't find where it is. Such a shame too, this could have been so useful for us. I liked how the outer bedding layer is washable and it is easy to reassemble it afterwards. I just can't give this product a good rating when it goes flat within an hour of my small kiddo laying on it."
3,A good one if you have Neighbors From Hades next door!,The movie was indeed boring in parts and the dialogue was insufferable at times---but the kernals of truth that popped out here and there were priceless. If you have a next door neighbor who is oblivious to reality and how he or she is negatively impacting your neighborhood---(as I do!) you HAVE to watch this flick! Some great one-liners I won't forget came out of this one! Mary from Northville (And keep praying---that they move!)
1,WARNING,"This is one of the worst CDs I ever bought. The music is a repetitive and tasteless synthesizer based background. If you choose to buy this album, the best thing that can happen is that you don't understand French (in that way the lyrics will not bored you to death). On top of it, Mylene's voice is unimpressive making the whole thing a waste of time and money. WARNING: if you like music, stay away from this CD."
1,Shouldn't there be a Law against this?,"Hmmm...where do I begin? First of all, as an American, after listening to this cd I have never been more proud of my country. I mean, I the thought that this could even be a possibility to make airwaves here sends shivers down my spine. All the songs on here are tiring and relentless...and basically have no point. My peronal fav is the Farmer's Conclusion song, because at least she has the help of animals to drown out her terrible voice."
5,World War II Book,I bought this book for my 9 year old son. He is very interested in World War II and other wars. He truly loved this book. Besides the CD it also comes with a neat airplane poster that he thought was pretty cool.
4,Great overview of WWII,The book is well laid out with some very interesting pictures. The DVD clip art of WWII is an extra bonus.
2,Just Pictures,This was not what I had expected. It is just a collection of WW II objects. It might be good for someone who would want graphics to scan in to a paper for a class.
3,A Bit too easy!,I was surprised at how easy this puzzle was to put together. My kids (12 & 10) had no problems assembling this in one day. I guess I was expecting a bit more challenge. It would be great for 8-10 year old children.
3,Nice but a little stiff...,"Overall this is a pretty nice rug, and that is all is can really be used for. The underside is described as a non-skid backing for carpet floor, which it may be, but it makes it so stiff that the rug will keep the fold lines from how it is packaged. The back is some kind of material with non-skid dots, so I think it would probably slide on a hard floor (I don't really have any to test it on). It also says in the description that you could use it as a throw across your bed or couch, but I don't see how that is possible because of the stiffness. It does has nice, soft ""fur"", but it could have been a lot better made. It just feels a little cheap."
1,Horrible,"Save your money, this movie is terrible. No real plot, long, boring, actors are unknown and can't act, very low budget movie. I wouldn't get this movie if it were free!"
4,this aussie movie shoulda got cinematic release in Australia,"Great acting, directing, cinematography, music, story and moral dilemnas.It's also a good arguement for legalising prostitution and abortion in the many parts of the world where it's still illegal but can be accessed and found easily-and the women have no rights making it no better than the slave trade."
1,Cheesecake Gone Terribly Wrong,"This book is certainly beautiful, but the one recipe I chose to make was a disaster! I made the Cranberry Beach-Plum Cheesecake on page 129 which calls for cream cheese, ricotta, sour cream, and ten eggs, but NO sugar! This was not a savory cheesecake, but a DESSERT, and the tart cranberry topping and graham cracker crust could not compensate for the blandness of straight cheese and eggs, flavored only with vanilla. It was so startling and unexpected that my friend actually spit it out.Was this an error in proof reading, or simply a bad recipe? It certainly makes me hesitant to try another recipe from this book."
4,Cozy and Comfortable,The book is a wonderful read just on its own. Susan Simon lends her own stories to some of the recipes. The recipes are wonderul and not hard. I felt very comfortable reading the book and anticipating the upcoming Holiday season.
3,Emergency Drinking Water,"Handy to have; along with your other emergency gear, the ability to quickly purify drinking water is important. These tablets are small and sealed; easy to have several around ""just in case""."
2,analyze the water,"Did you analyze the water or just making generalizations (""it certainly removes harmful bacterial, cysts, and protozoa."")Yeah, thought so."
3,It's Okay,"I went on a Kyle M Yates binge and bought all the study books I could find online that he wrote. The reason I did this is because I bought one on Amos and it was amazing! This book didn't live up to the same quality. It lacked focus and was too heavy on application (which now is dated). What I was hoping to find was the excellence in language and history that the Amos book had. I suppose that anyone who tried to tackle the book of Psalms for a short study is doomed to produce banal groupings and attempts at personalizing it for the reader. I enjoyed it as a quality work for what it attempted, it just wasn't what I hoped it would be."
4,A review of the battle from a present Union officer.,"A great read of the historical turning point of the U. S. Civil War. Haskell describes the three days of battle and the aftermath. Haskell was subsequently killed in one of the latter battles of the Civil War. Although inaccurate at places, it gives a first hand account of this battle, and the subsequent suffering of the soldiers. This is a good account of the life of a soldier."
4,Mixed Bag of Goodies,"Though several of the songs bend good taste to the breaking point, there are many that are good for a laugh and several that point to the sad and tragic realities of Christmas."
5,A Laughing Christmas,"I love this version of Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies. I play it throughout the entire year, as it always make me laugh. Can you think of anything more ubiquitous and overdone around the holidays than the Nutcracker Suite? This song is like the sparkling aperitif to more meaty holiday favorites."
3,Holidays Bad? Vandals Good.,"A decent addition to any holiday music library for those with a sense of humor. Every song must be taken tongue-in-cheek and should be considered unsafe for work or holiday parties with children present. Not for the easily offended, ""Oi to the World"" is a fast-paced, sometimes jarring mockery of the Christmas spirit. To their credit, The Vandals have produced something that is not a re-hash of tired holiday carols or a straightforward parody -- it is an in-your-face, cursing and vomiting tirade against Christmas tradition without being preachy.Fans of The Vandals and other late 80s / early 90s punk will enjoy this immensely. Others probably will not."
2,used book/condition,This is a good book on a healthy style of eating & the steps to get there. However I was disappointed by the less than good condition of this book. The re-seller stated it was in good condition. The cover was stained & the pages very yellowed. Would hesitate to purchase from this particucular seller in the near future.
4,good belt.,"Ordered the olive belt. Advertisement says the olive belt is 54"". It is 44"" The company offered to take it back and send correct length. I ordered the 54 and decided to keep this one. I need to lose weight anyway. If I don't make it, I can always use this one for a strap....."
1,why doesn't the belt seller provide the belt width...,"This belt would be great and a bargain - if it fit through any belt loops.I'd hoped to have a trim looking every-day belt that could take more wear and tear than the basic leather belt. In other words, the type of army belt I used to buy in stores.Unfortuntately, it can only be worn w/ one pair of shorts I own."
5,"The French ""New Wave"" at its height","Amazon's review is right on the money concerning this film.What I would add is that this film best shows the change that female sexual liberation had on society. The boy, totally in love, has nothing of value to give to a girl who considers sex an everyday occurance -- a big change from the going-steady days of the late fifties and early sixties when sex was the culmination of a protracted courtship. The masculine and feminine roles changed forever and continue so to this day. Goddard was there first. In 1966, this film was cutting edge. In 1999 it remains an important work with a lot to say to the present generation concerning the battle of the sexes that has, apparently, been won for good by the ladies.I saw it in 1966 on a first date with a very conservative girl who was convinced after we left the theatre that I was a sex pervert. Unfortunately for me she was as yet unwashed by the New Wave."
4,a nice film with excellent music.,"this review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Masculin Feminin"" is a film about a group of teenagers in 1960's Paris who go on outings together. Movie theatres, dance clubs, and love affairs.The film is set against the beginnings of youth culture in France and got the equivelant of an NC-17 rating when it was released in France but would most likely get a PG or PG-13 rating by today's standards.The film has some very nice 1960's French pop music which I really liked and would watch the film solely for the music.The DVD has an archival and a new interview with main actress Chantal Goya along with new interviews with other cast and crew. There is also a discussion of the film between two film experts Freddy Buache and Dominique Pani, Swedish TV footage of the production of the fictional Swedish film featured in the movie, an original theatrical trailer and a new trailer for the re-release."
4,Great glimpse into the 60's,"An interesting coming-of-age commentry of the 60s. Great cameos.. you need to look out for them though because they are brief. This was a productive period for French Chantreuses. Goya was one of the ye-ye period girls. Great music, not quite on a par with Francoise Hardy, Sylvie Vartan and France Gall, but not bad."
5,An excellent overview of Catholic Ecumenical Theology,"Br. Jeffrey Gros, FSC and his colleague Ann Riggs have provided their readers with a clear, accurate and very readable introduction to the history and theology of the Ecumenical Movement from a Roman Catholic perspective. Completely devoid of polemics, the author is straightforward on the issues which divide and unite Christianity"
4,"Solid theory and practical stuff, too","This book was obviously designed to help the student understand how video can be used in the various human service fields. It has loads of academic background that was interesting, but would not be necessary for anyone looking for a how-to approach. The most exciting portions of the book are the sections about the self-modeling technique. Self-modeling uses video technology to show a person only their desired behavior (films are edited or contrived) and that behavior is increased when the person sees herself ""doing it well."" This has loads of applications in many arenas and holds fantastic promise in the field of education and in behavior therapy. All in all, very worthwhile for those working in the helping professions and looking for ways to work with people in creative ways."
1,I don't get it,"Artsy is good, but this? There are about 20 lines in the whole movie and there is no plot. I've never seen anything like this, and I mean that in a bad way."
1,I'm not sure what to say,I decided to rent this movie because of all the positive reviews and the praise from the film festival. This is unfortunetly a terrible movie with no resolution of any of the issues confronted by the characters of the film. I do not recommend this film to anyone who hopes to find an uplifting and triumphant tale of love in spite of tragic events and loss.
1,Simply horrible,"It dragged and dragged and dragged...very dissapointing since Brad Pitt and Sean Penn are in it, would have never expected such a confusing, are you serious type of flic. That is all...."
2,MY GRADE: C minus,"20 minutes was enough of this film. Is it artistic? Yes. Does it have something to say about the human experience? Quite a bit, actually. Is it engaging? Nope. Could I get these questions from somewhere else and have time to dwell on them rather than look at artistic pictures that probably go on for an hour? Yes. Reminiscent of Kubrick's work and well loved by the critics. That said, I'll be using my movie time for something that considers holding the interest of the audience. MY GRADE: C minus; WHEN WATCHED: today."
2,The Tree Of LIfe,"Did not like,The Tree Of LifeI thought this was not his best work at all, I found the whole movie very slow."
2,"Beautiful, but....","Weird, dissonant, over-achieving. Probably appeals to those who view the film as existential art attempting to answer the meaning of life. Felt like I was watching an unexplained, long episode of ""Nature"" or ""Nova"". The only redeeming factor that kept me from turning this off was the mesmerizing cinematography and CGI."
2,It's a puzzlement.,"The Tree Of LifeAfter reading the favorable reviews, I might give this one another chance. Normally I love films with symbolism, but this one was beyond or above my pay level. I started to get irritated with the flashbacks and lack, for me, of cohesion. The photography was beautiful, but to me Fellini's films captured a mood, symbolism, a story, and always left you thinking. His film, Juliet of the Spirits, reminded me of The Tree of Life in some ways, but I loved Juliet of the Spirits. I was frustrated with the tree. The one stand out to me was Jessica Chastain's performance. I had seen her in The Help and in Debt, and was amazed by her versatility. Someday, she may be the next Meryl Streep. Since so many people seemed to love this film, I'm going to give it one more try after reading their analyses."
2,Great photography / Lousy movie!,Interesting how the positive reviews try to make up excuses for this movie being the way it is.Often the characters are mumbling and it is hard to know what they are saying.The kids in the movie often play games and the viewer is totally lost trying to figure out what games they are playing.Brad Pitt is often seen just giving looks without any communication with his kids or his wife.I guess mind readers might like this movie.The makers of this movie make no effort in trying to help the viewer make any sense of the movie.The photography is awesome. I thought I was going to watch a movie and watched it because of the reviews.I guess if you watched the movie a few times it might begin to make sense. Had trouble staying awake.If I hadn't watched this in HD I would have given it a one star!
2,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" meets ""Ordinary People""","A bold experiment trying to be too many things to too few people. Everything but the kitchen sink: creationism vs evolution, nature vs nurture, good vs evil, life vs death, etc etc. Had it focused on the main story and left out the Robin Williams' ""What Dreams May Come"" effects, for me it would truly deserve its Acadamy Award nomination."
3,"Wow, a totally decent experience and nothing more.","I cannot believe how overrated and underrated this film is. I can see a masterpiece here if two hours or so were added to the experience. As is this is nothing more than some great snippets from childhood and a half-baked creationist saga. I like it more than I feel okay about it but it just doesn't have that feeling some of his other films have. Malick is a seriously talented auteur who I am sure struggled with putting this into a digestible film for theaters, but this is clearly not good enough. I don't really have a problem with the CGI or anything but none of this grows into a cohesive whole. I just feel like IN THE LEAST another hour should have been added on here. I can only give this work three stars. As it stands it is nothing more than a glance into the entire vision in my humble opinion. I hope there is a director's cut."
5,Cinematographers Drem,This movie has been an inspiration in regards to its cinematogephy the story not so much but at end of the day its worth watching it jst for this fact.
1,I'd give it NO STARS if I could,"I'm an artist and can definitely appreciate something different and new, but this movie totally sucked. I kept thinking...""maybe it'll all come together at the end and it'll be worth it"" , but, it didn't.I mean, I GET what the movie is about, but still! It was just too much, even with fast forwarding some scenes, it just kept draaaaagging on. My husband fell asleep a few times, but I was determined to know that this movie was not a waste of time and money, but IT WAS.If you really have to see it, go rent it from REDBOX, but don't say you haven't been warned about how much this movie really sucks."
1,Zzzzzzz,My wife and I never... NEVER fall asleep in front of movies. Congratulations Tree of Life. It was a first for us.At least we were in our own home.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I like deep, thoughtful movies, but this was just complete nonsense. Also, to say it stars Sean Penn is ridiculous. He appears for approximately 3 minutes and has 4 lines, if that."
1,WTH,"Worst movie ever. Horrible, had absolutely nothing to offer. I feel like poking my eyes out. I don't understand how people can go on acting like they enjoyed this. I don't even understand how any of these actors decided to take part in this movie. The script was probably no longer than 5 pages."
1,Don't rent this movie if you value your time,"Unfortunately my wife and I rented this movie for 48 hours. It was so bad the dog left the room and went to bed. We were stupid enough to sit thru the entire painful 2.5 hours thinking that there would be some plot or redeaming value to the film. There was none. This movie equals ""Howard the Duck"" or ""Mars Attacks"" as the worse movie ever made but without any attempt to entertain. Brad Pitt and Shawn Penn must have made this movie as a dare. Hopefully this movie will end their careers. I still have 30 hours of the rental. Does anyone want to visit us and see the movie? Bring lots of beer!"
1,I should have listened to my gut....,"....And turned this off after 20 minutes. But I didn't. I watched the complete movie, hoping it would come together and make sense. It never did. This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. I really like Sean Penn and Brad Pitt, but this movie is disappointing.Turn on the Discovery Planet Earth series. Turn on some loud opera/piano music. Have someone stand behind you as you watch/listen and whisper things in your ear like, ""Are you watching me?"" or ""I wanted to believe you were there."" Then turn on two minutes of Jurassic Park with some dinosaur footage.That sums up the movie. Awful."
1,Waste of time ...,I'm sorry that I could not see the deep vision behind this very slow and almost client movie .. its plain waste of time
1,Like an ice pick through the eye,"Extremely painful to watch. Boring beyond belief. Watched about ten confusing minutes of a family that might have lost one of their kids. Then about 45 minutes of waterfalls, planets and sunsets with some woman whispering stupid stuff like ""I will find you"". I went back to Red Box and wanted to throw it at the machine."
1,"Be warned, one strange movie","I watched 50 minutes of scenery with a woman who lost her son saying ""why god did this happen to me"" every few minutes. This is one strange movie. There should be a warning something like ""this movie is not for entertainment purposes"" on the box."
1,Less than a zero for this movie,UGH. . . . Words can not describe this horrible time-wasting movie. I watched this movie hoping that there must be more to it. Yeah I got where it was trying to go. NO WHERE. What a waste of time. What a waste of money to even produce such nothingness. The only thing this movie was good for was . . . . helping the economy by giving a few people jobs. Yeah that's it. I'm glad I borrowed this movie from a friend of friend of a friend. I don't believe they even brought it (a library copy.) Brad Pitt and Sean Penn should be ashamed of themselves for even participating in this mess. UGH . . .
3,Beautifully Done. Too Long,"Beautifully written and acted film. The only way I could watch this film was to take notes on my tablet to keep me focused and following the sometimes mysterious dialogue. I cannot imagine having lasted sitting through this in the movie theater. The director needed to have resisted the urge to show us every example of circles in nature. The dinosaur scene was unrealistic. The reptilian bird definitely would have eaten that vulnerable dinosaur baby it grabbed by the neck.I would have liked to have seen the Sean Penn character's current life fleshed out a bit more. We looked back but its not specifically clear, why we did. Why does it matter that Sean glanced at the blonde woman who walked by?"
4,An astonishingly beautiful meditation on life,"Astonishingly beautiful meditation on life. You may respond with a reverential ""Oh, my god"" or with a bewildered ""What the f***?"" or, likely, a combination thereof but this is undeniably a master filmmaker at ease and in love with his medium. The ending of the film, unfortunately, is a bit hackneyed and does more to obscure than to clarify but, even with that, this is formidable achievement of cinematic art which should be seen on film on the biggest screen you can find."
1,Plot?,"This movie was all symbolism and no plot. Nothing happened. Lots of fractals, no story. Wait till it comes out for free somewhere then watch the first five minutes and the last five minutes and you'll realize that nothing happens. I want $100 back. $4 for the rental fee and the $43 an hour I didn't make by staying an extra two hours at work today. The worst part was sitting there thinking something was going to happen but it never does. Maybe useful as a sleeping aid."
2,Visually stunning = Boring,"Sorry, this may be a wonderful moving movie - but we were bored out of our minds.The visuals of the universe go on, and on, and on, and ON.The dialog was abstract when there was dialog."
1,"Boring, Pretentious -- AVOID!","This movie is soooo overrated. Slogging through 2+ hours is not worth your time for this garbage. AVOID! I like Brad Pitt, but this is one of his worst."
1,don't waste your time,"i have not written any movie reviews but after attempting to watch this for over 40 minutes, and thankfully finally giving up, i must suggest that you don't waste your time. i am SO glad we didn't pay to see this in a theater! hated the story, hated the music, hated the disjointedness. a senseless movie with no redeeming qualities -- at least the 40 minutes we watched...! if i could give it less than 1 star i absolutley would do so..."
1,Lasted about 15 minutes,"If it had not been for the two star actors, this film would not have hit anyone's radar. Lasted about 15 minutes hoping that it would get better, clearer, interesting. It did not."
1,Yuck,"I wasted my time. Reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Boring, too long, too strange. Did I mention boring? Granted, the acting was good, I thought the kids did very well. But I will never get those 2+ hours back and I am really sorry about that."
3,Cosmic Woo & Patriarchal Ewww,"My simplistic review-interpretation of the film Tree of Life:It's a non-narrative artsy collection of memory slices that critique the masculinized childhood of one man growing up in a 1950s patriarchal family with serious Oedipal issues. This terminally pathetic goo gets sandwiched in some breathtaking cosmic woo a la all great wide angle panoramic experimental cinema that seeks to capture the mystery and wonder of all things. The reviews on Amazon were divided between 1-star and 5-star (brilliant or terrible), & now I can see why.I didn't mind the cosmic woo but was depressed by the patriarchal ewww. And my own spiritual awakenings have been more cinematic. Or to quote my sweetie: 'That's two hours we'll never get back.'"
2,Less than meets the eye.,"Trite dysfunctional dramatics are linked with nothing less than the creation of the universe in what must be the single most pretentious film I've ever seen. Radiantly beautiful cinematography and fervently whispered poetic voiceovers and only vague whispers of anything as base as a ""plot"" or ""characterization"" make this an unbelievably empty experience -- like flipping through an art history text while listening to some self-help audiobook."
1,Short-Term Memory Loss?...or Simply a Lousy Film?,"Considering the fact I just sat (and fidgeted) through THE [FRUITLESS] TREE OF LIFE only a week ago, I must question myself seriously: Am I having a ""senior moment""? Or was the film, in fact, so mind-numbingly dull, so ridiculously disjointed I can barely dredge up a single substantive ""event"" from its desultory, apparently-forgettable-as-soon-as-you've-watched-it mishmash.I shall now proceed to some of the less unfavorable reviews to find out exactly what it was I believe I had the good fortune to forget."
1,An artistic mess,"Would have been GREAT as a 15 minute short. Way too long and disjointed this film is all over the place and hard to follow. Actually there is LITTLE TO follow. The visuals are STUNNING, but this does make a two movie."
1,Please don't waste a second of your life on this movie,"I've never written a review before, but this movie wasted 90 minutes of my life (actually the movie runs for 2hours and 18 minutes but I couldn't take much more of its nonsense). There is virtually no dialogue and it is boring to the extreme. I have to admit the visuals were stunning, especially the creation sequence. However, I feel that any positive reviews for this movie come from self-deluded people who consider themselves intellectuals and feel that they have to state their love for their movie or else appear stupid. Well I freely admit my stupidity because I HATED this movie. 0 stars!"
1,Very Disappointed,"The title and the actors interested me, but I was so very disappointed. It took at least 60% of the movie before there was any decent, but still limited dialogue. The movie was mostly just music and scenery, even animation from prehistoric times. Sorry but it was a waste of my time and money. I couldn't see the point of its production. I just could not relate to it in general since I was looking for entertainment."
1,30 minutes spent - no story began,"I spent 30 minutes, and realized that story has not began. Only music and graphics... no need to watch this video."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","This ""movie"" is just pure trash, egotistical and a waste of time. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! Watched until the end thinking there might be a redeeming moment but NO.... Garbage! Garbage! Garbage and HIGHLY pretentious!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!! I had to give it a one star to have this review published but it doesn't deserve even that...."
1,If 1/2 star had been offered...,"I can't even imagine what Mr. Malick was thinking when he made this movie... talk about self indulgent! Run, don't walk, and do something useful with your life. What a waste!!!"
1,Watch pretty pictures for 2 hours,"After reading the reviews, I thought this might be an interesting movie about life. I really wanted to gave this a chance. At about 15 minutes into the story, I was waiting for the story to begin. I gave it another 2 minutes, but decided to switch to another movie. If you want to see a movie about father/son relationships watch something like October Sky for a real story. I don't know what this style of movie might be called - interesting photography, images, lighting is very light, almost pastel - however, movies are still about stories, dialog and action which was seriously missing."
1,emperors new clothes,"If you like movies that are essentially plotless with no character development this is the movie for you. While the cinematography was pretty it was one diffuse scene after another and very few scenes tied together. After all the build up from the critics who often raved about the film, I felt really ripped off. But I can imagine that for people who love artsy symbolism and lots of vague metaphor and who don't care about dialogue or a coherent plot - this would be viewed as a great movie. To me it was emperors new clothes and the emperor was certainly naked."
1,An artistic piece that you don't want to see,"I have never reviewed a movie here. I watched this all the way through because I thought there must be something great that would happen somewhere in this movie. I was patient and diligent. I have at least average intelligence and I found this movie to be confusing, boring and just plain sad to see what was happening in the family. My Dad was somewhat like this man and I didn't enjoy watching him treat his family so badly. I can't believe that anyone would like watching his behavior and the impact it had on his wife and children. I didn't see a lesson to be learned from it either. There was some really great cinematography but I'd rather watch a national geo movie than have to sit through this kind of nonsense. I'm sure the artsy intelligent people will continue to say what a great movie this is but they can have it."
1,"Beautiful, Artsty but boring","This is not your standard movie, many will not understand it or be moved by it. This is not for those who want a story-line to follow. The best description is it's comparison to Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Oddessy"". That said, it is visually stunning and music are beautiful! But that didn't improve my experience, I actually turned if off after about 45 minutes. I could not in all honesty recommend this one unless you love the abstract."
1,So painfull,"This movie was the most painful theatre experience I have ever had. I knew since first seeing the trailer that this movie was incredibly pretentious and vapid but decided to accompany my friend who is an intense Malick fan. Had incredibly low expectations but even those did not prepare me for the 139 minutes of hell I had to endure. I gave up trying to understand the symbolism and meaning in the movie midway through it when they started showing dinosaurs and flying though the universe. I have never ever wanted to leave a theatre so bad in my life. Afterwards the same friend sent me links posted by people trying to explain the meaning in certain scenes of the movie, I didn't care nor did I want to know, I was totally disgusted with this movie."
1,Awful movie,I thought Sean Penn and Brad Pitt how could you go wrong? WRONG....this movie was complete garbage and a complete waste of time and money. If I saw this in the theatres I would of literally walked out it was that bad. This movie would only make sense if you are on drugs.
1,Less than a star,"Possibly the worst movie I have ever started to watch, turned off or fell asleep half way through.Could not get through the dismal creation opening 30 minutes which seemed like a real lifetime!"
3,Not sure,"This isn't a movie, it is an experience. I have to be in right mood for viewing something like this. I also think it doesn't do the movie justice to watch it on a 21"" TV screen. Because it is an experinece it needs a dark theatre and a large screen."
2,waste of time,"I expected to be awed by this film and maybe experience life-altering epiphanies. So disappointed. There was confusion in which son died and why until the end credits appeared. I need to be more selective in my choosing films and guided by my wish for entertainment and less dependent on critics. I found the whole evolutionary process ridiculous. When the dinosaur appeared it was laughable. Art for art's sake and pseudo reverance might be part of some filmmaking but for my viewing pleasure it is worthless.whatever the message might be, and the question of whether we go through life by nature or grace does not concern me.Gail S."
2,Not what i expected,This is not a movie as much as it is a documentary & work of art. It was interesting with beautiful scenes. And the acting that was there was very good. But its not a movie u sit down with friends to watch for a good time.
2,Very Abstract and Depressing But Beautiful Cinematography,"Very Abstract and Depressing But Beautiful Cinematography. I liked Brad Pitt and Sean Penn in other movies, but I did not enjoy their characters this time. The scenes of nature kept me watching to the end, the story, dialogue and characters were not interesting to me."
2,a battle between beautiful and annoying,"This is like two unrelated films that have been mashed together - one is a collection of beautiful images of God's creation (a bit like Koyaanisqatsi but not as good), the other a family melodrama. Brad Pitt is excellent - the family melodrama part has potential, it's like the early draft of a good film. However, the whispered/muttered ""profound"" phrases that pervade the film are ridiculous - they reminded me of the uplifting cliches on those annoying inspirational posters - and the Sean Penn character should have been edited out. (I love Sean Penn, but his character adds nothing to the film.) The final scene is like a Monty Python skit - but the humor is (I assume) unintentional. Overall, this film is way too long and ridiculously pretentious. I like long, profound, artsy films as much as the next guy, but this film is like a parody of the genre. I stayed through the whole thing hoping it would get better, but it got worse."
3,"Great performances and some nice photography, but quite bloated","There is some great material here, with fine performances from Pitt, Chastain, and the younger actors. Too bad the director insists on bloated, long shots of the Big Bang, dinosaurs, and who knows what else that almost put me to sleep. Skip those parts and go directly to the story of a too-strict father, his wife, and their troubled sons.There is also not much done with Sean Penn, as the adult version of one son. It's a shame they wasted him."
1,BORING!!!!,"We had heard this was a pro-life movie and were disgusted that it wasn't available in the stores. We were also disappointed that it did poorly at the box office.HOWEVER, having spent more for the DVD than it would have cost to go to the theater, no big demand, so no price break, we wasted our money.I am not sure what this movie is for. It moves so slowly that staying awake is a real effort. When the movie ended, our reaction (mine and my wife's) was, ""Huh?""This is a total dud and waste of money."
1,Godawful!,"I am actually at a loss for words to say how bad this movie was. I should have turned it off during the ""National Geographic"" segment. My husband wanted to, but I said ""no, let's stay with it."" MISTAKE! Ugh, so awful. Don't waste your time. This might be the worst movie I have ever seen. Really. I didn't even want to give it one star, but apparently you have to click at least one."
3,Movie Purchase Review,"The movie arrived on time and in good condition. However, the quality of the movie was poor. Disappointed in the quality and the content of the movie."
1,i love brad....but,this movie was aweful. i love brad but i just couldnt get into this movie at all. bummer cause i love all his other movies
1,Really Pretentious,this movie is 2.5 hours long - if you cut out the crap it would be about 20 minutes long - might be the worst movie I have ever seen.As the movie went on (and on) I kept waiting for it to improve - it never did
2,"I tried, I really tried to watch this ............ but","I really , really tried to watch this movie, but I just could not stand to watch much of it.I found it annoying to try and watch.Now that I am older, I appreciate movies about life's experiences ....films like THE STRAIGHT STORY, DOOR TO DOOR, etc ...But somehow this movie seemed to abstract, incohesive and ""artsy""It felt like well framed scenes pasted together in random fashion but the sum of the parts ended up less than the whole.Rather than get pulled in and compelled to watch, it was more of an effort to watch to the point it simply was not worth the effort -------- no care or concern for the characters at all.After a few attempts, I simply could not tolerate more than 30 minutes of it.The 2 people watching it with me were of the same opinion.Beautifully filmed scenes, but it just never came together as a compelling story.The background DRONING monotone music and heavy repetitive pedal points also were annoying"
1,Total waste of time!,"My wife and I went to see the movie, Tree of Life. After the first 15 to 20 minutes I was ready to walk out. I had no clue of what was going on, who were what characters and what was the story line. All of the speech was in a whisper and the background music successfully covered it up so I had no clue of what was being said. My wife wanted to stay so I did. I finally determined it was a story about a dis-functional family. Fortunately, I fell asleep and was not subjected to any more uncomprehensible sights or sounds of this totally terrible waste of time movie."
1,stupid,"I just watched this and could not tell you what it was about. I kept turning up the volume to try to hear what the characters were saying but could only make out about half of the words. Seems like a story about a little kid growing up with an abusive father and loving Mother. Centers on one kid in the family who seems to be turning out like his father. The ending was completely crazy, the father loses his job and they pack up the car and I have no idea what was going on after that. First I thought they were going science fiction or something. If this is art then it is bazaar.I would not recommend buying this unless you at least watch a preview.I see a lot of people love this movie and I normally love deep alternative type films but this was just a bunch of images and not even a good soundtrack. I watched it to the end thinking something would come together but it never did."
1,I wish i could give this 0 stars,"Absolute garbage! Trying to be too clever through ""art"", this film is just an annoying mash up of visual mumbo jumbo. Forget about it if you want a film where you can follow a story. It's not clever and is just a waste of money. I had to turn it off, we watched and waited for it to do something given it had won awards, but alas it went from clouds to dinosaurs to other rubbish. Don't waste your time!"
1,terrible,This movie was so slow and so all over the place that I kept on wathcing just so it could get better. before i knew it - it was all over and I felt dissapointed and bored. What a waste of a Sat night!!
2,A Withered Root.,"Beautifully filmed! Talented cast, for the most part and perhaps the most self aggrandizing, pretentious, and painfully exhausted ""father dynamic"" story ever put on film. A long three acts that never resolve satisfactorily and leaves the audience not bewildered by the convoluted moral message but by the affected exposition.This is best viewed as a master's class in cinematography and a how to film on what not to do when trying to convey a story.WJH"
1,Worst movie ever!,"Wow! I wanted to turn it off within 15 mins. My husband made me watch the whole movie. What a huge waste of time. I am a huge Brad Pitt fan, but this is garbage. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have!"
4,Pitt was amazing,I loved Sean Penn's acting in this one as well as Brad Pitt's. Tree of Life is a must see. Some scenes were slow in some parts but overall visually stunning.
1,Boring,"This movie is terrible, it is visually beautiful, but seriously 35 min in there still was not plot and very little dialog. Just whispers in the back ground. Don't waste your time."
1,Need a ZERO star category,"While the photography and filming of volcanoes, super novas, sunbursts is stunning there is ZERO plot, ZERO sense, and you need anti-nausea tablets so you don't get dizzy from the abrupt changes in camera angle. Reminds me of Space Odyssey 2001 which was meant to be seen while doing illegal drugs. Save your money. This wasn't even worth the rental."
1,oh no......,"What was this one about? I thought Brad Pitt & Sean Penn, no matter what anyone writes, I cannot go wrong. I turned it off after 20 minutes...should have paid attention to the reviews."
1,Pretencious B.S.,"Dramatic camera angles (the kind that give you a good look up everyone's nostrils), nature photography, and whispering of 'deep thoughts' sentence fragments. Give me a break. Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever rented."
1,TREE OF LIFE SUCKS,"THIS MOVIE MAKES ED WOOD LOOK GREAT.WORST THING I HAVE TRIED TO WATCH IN YEARS.IF YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
3,Cosmogony and domestic melodrama.,"Terrence Malick directs an ambitious film fusing his vision of familial discord with imagery of big-bang phenomenon, apparently to illuminate and confront some of the natural and spiritual drives that dominate human behavior. The scenes of domestic discord are the best thing about the picture. The cosmic imagery is nothing new, and plays out as the simplest kind of metaphor. The film is laughable at points, particularly in the end, with a goofy, Felliniesque finale evoking a blissful heavenly reunion of sorts (cynical implications loom large).It is a minor effort compared to similar intellectual cinema by the likes of Ingmar Bergman and Stanley Kubrick. TREE OF LIFE, much like his previous film, THE NEW WORLD, is a far cry from Malick's better work (BADLANDS, DAYS OF HEAVEN and THE THIN RED LINE)."
3,Beautiful and baffling,"I don't often encounter films that leave me genuinely baffled, but ""The Tree of Life"" is that rare film for which my only honest response is ""huh?"" I suspect that the flaw lies in my lack of cinematic sophistication. Although I consider myself a film geek and I can usually figure out the subtleties of artsy films, the film grammar and narrative style of this film elude me. I liked what I understood of the conventional portions of the film, which focus on the problematic and often discomfiting relationship between a young boy (played as an adult by Sean Penn) and his demanding, relentlessly strict 1950s-era father (played by Brad Pitt). Jessica Chastain is luminous as the wife and mother, and the film itself is a masterpiece of stunningly beautiful cinematography. But please don't ask me what the story means or how the various pieces of the film tie together, because I haven't a clue."
3,Read Wickipedia first,"Well, duh, if I had read the description of the film on Wicki first, I might have gotten more out of it. I thought it captured the 50s beautifully, but it wasn't even clear at first which character had died. Is Sean Penn supposed to resemble Jack? Big ears?Honestly, I think I need to watch it a second time.I lost my brother when he was 18 and I was 15. The pain you feel really does follow you through your life. Jack was a bully to his brother, too. Was it because the brother was so much like the dad? Artist and musician.Everything went back to the water. The origin of life?Mayne a little too obscure and I thought the black screening was a little long. Kept thinking it was my ROKU...."
2,"A boring, drawn out movie","Malick's Tree of Life exemplifies the director's arrogance for his movies. It is apparent during the long drawn out segments of the history of the universe and of Earth that Malick believes he can simply ignore plot, immersion, and interest to try to get his philosophical and artistic ideas onto the screen. However, I give this review 2 stars, not one, because there are some redeeming parts in the middle of the film where he ceases to be artistic and focuses more on the character development and family structure which actually mimics Malick's own upbringing. Perhaps this would have been better as a short, 45-minute film, but instead any semblance of a good movie is lost in philosophical nonsense which simply alienates the viewer."
1,I can't believe I sat thru this...,"In reading all the rave reviews I have come to the conclusion that I am one of the haters. When I first started watching I thought I had rented a Planet Earth episode. Squirming in my chair, I waited for some dialog, some actual people. Finally I fast-forwarded until I saw some humans on my screen. It was tolerable after that but definitely not what I had expected from the synopsis that I read. If you're not into artsy films, don't watch this one. I can't figure out what all the fuss is about, I'm not one who gives up on a film once I start watching but I almost did on this one."
1,Terrible...,well that was a big waste of my time...I get it and it was just lousy...not entertaining at all...felt like this was a movie made just to torture students required to explain what it all meant...
1,The Cure for Insomnia,"Congratulations, while it was probably unintentional, the writer, director, producers, actors, and everyone else affiliated with this movie have finally found the cure for insomnia. No need to purchase expensive drugs that can leave someone with an addiction that ruins their life. They can spend $20 and get the best night's sleep for the rest of their life by spending 15 minutes watching this movie.That being said, how does everyone find this movie visually appealing? I saw 15 minutes of screensavers and people whispering nothingness. This was the absolute worst 15 minutes of my life. This movie should be boycott by human rights organizations because this movie is cruel punishment and torture."
1,"2011 ""Best Picture"" Nominee???? Another ""emperor's new clothes"".","Ok, to start: (1) knew nothing about this film when I rented it other than it nominated as best picture of 2011 and (2) did not and could not make it all the way through this film. With that said, no idea why anyone would think this film is anything other than a total waste of time. ""Artsy"" comes to mind. Over-reaching, comes to mind. I do appreciate when one tries to encapsulate some aspect of living such that it is conveyed to others, actually conveyed, much as real art tries to do, but this picture is a total failure. I can not believe that the first 35-45 minutes was this terrible mismash of special effects about our planet forming and early life. Duh, been done so many times and ever so much better than this movie tries to do. Enough. Not recommended at all."
1,so far....67 retards liked this movie,"I am stunned at the 67 people who gave this five stars!! I gave it one (which it didn't deserve) so I could make a comment. That was the stupidest movie I have ever seen. For it to knock the rest of my worst movies off the list...that's how bad it was. If you gave it more than one star...you were tripping on acid, smoking crack, went to sleep before it was over."
1,what?,"I couldnt even watch the whole thing. BAD. There was no story, no dialog, maybe I am just not artsy or refined enough, but it really sucked, IMO."
5,turn it up,"I'm sure this has been reviewed to death, so I'll just say put me in the 5-star column. There is a way of nature and a way of grace, represented by the different personalities of two parents, raising three boys in 1950s Texas. But it's about so much more than that. It has everything - God even makes a cameo. Sad and joyful, inspirational and terrifying. Play it loud, because a lot of the narration is whispered."
2,Too pretentious to be enjoyable,This movie is like a roller coaster... that fell off the tracks. There are glimmers of something that would be interesting however the effort to make it into an Cannes winner makes it fall on it's face.
2,too artsy,"I liked the idea behind the movie, and it was beautifully filmed, but it dragged on and I became very bored. There were a lot of long artsy pauses and scenes that did not add to the story; A few of these scenes would have been very appropriate and much appreciated, but the directors went too far. The film could have been half the length and told the story more effectively."
2,"Hated the movie, but the DVD quality is good","I really, really didn't like this movie but was compelled to buy it anyway. It's got some nice classical music in the soundtrack, and the physical and technical quality of the DVD is good. So if the physical product is what I'm rating, then I give it high marks. But if it's the movie itself that I'm rating, I'd give it a zero. Overblown, pretentious piffle that masquerades as profundity but is really just a glib exploration of Terrence Malick's inflated ego, copiously illustrated with dinosaurs, Southern violence, and milk clouds."
1,"Pretentious, self-indulgent, boring","I don't care if they loved it at Cannes. I thought it was a lousy movie. There is some great music and some great scenic photography, both of which have no connection to the story which I could discern."
1,Sean Penn who?,All I can say is that this movie was almost as bad and boring as MELANCHOLIA! Raptors? Really?Rent this only if you are having trouble sleeping.
1,"oh, mother.","This movie reminded me of the film parodied at the end of Mr Bean's Holiday. It is so pretentious and awful, it will leave you in stitches....and I'm a film buff. We turned it off after the first twenty minutes or so, and are still muttering ""....mother....? "" to each other...and collapsing in laughter. The photography was pretty good, however, so I think this film is perhaps best appreciated by viewing its promotional stills, or watching it at 6x the clock speed, on mute."
1,It's not polite to whisper...,"Let's keep this short and sweet..I love daring movies, I love experimental movies, I love mysterious movies.I hated this movie. Hate may be too strong, I despise this movie because it pretended to be intellectual and artistic when it was actually mundane and stole everything from Earth Documentaries and actaul artistic art films from 20+ years ago. A little late Malick."
1,So boring.,"It reminded me of a film student's class project. It seemed to be trying very artistic, with lots of stock footage (space/nature/etc), lots of repetitive talk about God, with a thin, slow plot weaved in. I watched about an hour, and couldn't watch any more. The long parade of nature and space footage, with little bits of animation (there was a dinosaur) reminded me a bit of The Mind's Eye, only way less interesting. Such a waste of money. The acting was fine, for what little of it there seemed to be. The editing and quality of film itself was fine. The problem was the lack of plot, poor writing, and over use of stock footage."
1,"Long, drawn out and just plain boring","I saw this movie in Italy-of course it was in English, but I have to say I dragged a few Italian friends to see it since I had seen a few good reviews. WHY? I ask...horrid waste of time. there were some nice photos in the movie, but they read as stills. I thought it seemed pretentious, and a pathetic attempt at 'an art film'. (Now,""Tell us how you really feel!"")"
1,Absolute and total nonsense,"I've got a high tolerance for slow movies. I can usually appreciate a movie that others think was bad or slow or whatever.This movie on the other hand was so far out in left field it was basically 2 hours of total nonsense. I can't imagine how any normal human being could possibly say they enjoy this movie unless they are only trying to look smart.Immediately after the film, if you can call it that, someone told me she was going to start a support group for people who saw this movie. Another person said it was 2 hours of his life he'll never get back. This was in a theatre that shows these types of ""artsy"" movies exclusively.I'd call it pretentious, but that doesn't even describe it.If you want to completely waste 2 hours of your life, by all means watch this movie. It's worse than watching paint dry."
1,This movie has dinosaurs.,"Yes, the movie has dinosaurs. I cannot tell you why as I've been unable to really figure it out. I watched this movie knowing that it was very polarizing and I would either love it or hate it. I tried to love it - I did. I even started to believe I ""got it"". And then came the dinosaurs. You can try to say that this movie is existential and brilliant. I'm just going to go with the explanation that they were playing a joke on the viewing audience. It has to be a joke."
1,Oak of Ennui,"If you ever wondered what a four-minute REM video would be like expanded to 2 hours, only without the music and channeling Stanley Kubrick, well here's your answer. (Boy's voice, whispering: SAVE US FROM THIS PRETENTIOUS TWADDLE.)"
1,THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER WATCHED,The movie should be nominated as the RAZZIE Worst Movie of the Year. Trust me. You may be really sorry if you rent or buy this piece of merde.
1,A waste of money and time.,"I bought this from Amazon because it is a 2012 Academy Award nominee for Best Picture. This movie is crap. It is disjointed, confusing, disappointing, lacks a recognizable story line and made my wife and I both unhappy after watching it. Don't waste YOUR money. I can only be grateful, I didn't waste a lot more money watching it in the theaters.It also leads increasing credence to the complete lack of credibility to the Academy who nominates and votes on crap like this that is passed off as entertainment."
1,Worse movie ever,Oh my gosh I cannot believe so many thought this was a good film. Stanley Kubrick knew how to show on the screen man through the ages. This was the worst waste of people's time I could think of. Yes art is in the eye of the beholder. I aknowledge this is art but for me it is bad film making. What plot? This is as far from a normal film as can be made. I stayed until the end to give it every chance to redeem itself. Until now I thought Trip to Bountiful was the most boring film I had ever seen. This was far worse. Don't waste your hard earned money buying this DVD or seeing it in the theater. There are so many better movies out there.
1,Not the usual story telling method,"I guess there was a story in this movie. It seems like the director & screenwriter were trying to do a Kubrik-esque kind of movie, and in my opinion, failed miserably. If your kind of movie is one with a lot of nice visuals of just about everything under the sun with classical music playing in the background, this movie is for you. If you prefer movies with a plot and character development, you might want to take a pass on this one."
3,I am confused!,"I guess this movie was just to far over my head. I get the story, just wondered why it took so long to get there. However, it was worth watching just for the beautiful scenes in it. I watched it on my Lap Top which has a Blu-ray player and again on our television (sans Blu-ray). This film has made me start looking for an HD TV and a Blu-Ray dvd player!! Awesome..and the music was beautiful as well. To me, the story could have as easily be left off. Couldn't decide whether to like or hate the father!!"
2,Pretentious and boring,"Thought this would be a great movie, not painful hour after hour of watching a man walking around looking at the sky. I was highly disappointed, but I forced myself to watch the whole thing. I really regret it. Artistic? Yes. Visually appealing? Yes. Worth watching for hours? Oh god, no."
3,An extensive and Neotheist introduction,"This books covers a very broad range of issues. It is not written in a technical but in an accessible way, making it a good introduction to the subject. For each topic it exemplifies some chosen aspects, but this leads to misrepresentations (e. g. of the Kalam argument).. It is written from a Neotheist and evolutionist perspective. To counterbalance its Neotheist emphasis, I would recommend reading ""Creating God in the Image of Man"" by Norman L Geisler."
4,"Ingtruiging, confusing, full of risky ideas",The ideas that life is an illusion and that we are all actors perpetuating our own illusions are fascinating. This book contains some intruiging Existential ideas. I did get confused at times over who was playing which role.
3,Not as good as others by Sara Bennett :-(,"I really enjoyed Bennett's Lily and the Sword, so I anxiously awaited this book in the mail. However, I had a hard time finding any romance/spark that signified a love developing. Yes, they lusted after each other, but I didn't see any interaction between the heroine and hero that led me to believe they were soul mates. Oh well, I still enjoy Ms. Bennett's writing and will give her work another try."
1,a disappointment,"My husband and I both found this movie painfully slow and unconvincingly acted. We hung on, hoping that a good story could move it along, but the subplots (or what we thought might be subplots) went nowhere. I normally don't write reviews for Amazon, but I rely on them heavily. Therefore, when I saw that the only 2 reviews written for this item were so glowingly enthusiastic, I felt it my social responsibility to warn would-be customers. If you are curious about this movie, borrow it from the library, or even rent it - but please don't spend 17.99 for your own copy."
3,Austin musician's promising first effort,"If you think you've heard this voice before, it could be because Ms. Atchley sounds a bit like Edie Brickell or Sam Phillips...or it could be because she is the featured voice for Mattel's Barbie Girl Games CD ROMs. A classically trained musician from Texas, Amy performs regularly in the Austin area (or she did the last time I looked).I am giving this CD three stars only because it is very pop, sounding a bit overproduced to me. She's clearly a very talented writer and peformer, but I think she would benefit from a more realistic sound. My favorite song here is the last one, an acoustic number."
4,chewy louie,I thought the book was very funny and the boys father has a small temper. if that was my dog I would kick it out of the house but its just a kids book.
5,Chewy Louie,"""Chewy Louie"" is one of the best children's stories I've ever read. Not only did it keep my attention, I found myself laughing as I read the book. When the young boy gets a puppy, he soon finds out what puppies can do-chew. And chew, chew, chew, Louie does. He chews everything in sight, including furniture, cars, and visitors. You and your child will laugh out loud at the hilarious pictures! This book is just the thing when you're looking for a good laugh."
5,Chewy Louie,I had read this book at the library where I work and thought that my 3 year old granddaughter would enjoy hearing the story as much as I enjoyed reading the book. I was right! My daughter says that she has to read the book to her every evening before bed. We all have dogs - Chewy Louie has lived with us too!
5,Music of beauty and songs of intimacy,"Good music is without a doubt in the ear of the listener, and even good music will sooner or later be placed in the portion of the queue that gets almost no attention. Even praise and worship music are not free of that fate. This CD by Freddy Hayler, along with the others in the Angels series, has defied that fate for me. Mind you, I am one who delights in well-crafted electric guitar riffs and melodious drums backing vocals that are scripturally based. But there is a beauty the srings section of an orchestra can portray that surpasses any rock or pop oriented ensemble. Add to that the vocal power of a world-class tenor, who when staying in the low register shines with the emotion that can only come from countless of intimate hours with the Father, and you have something that simply approaches the angelic. Oh, and the book is a great bonus worth reading."
5,"Unique, distinctive, and highly recommended","Written and photographed by Ellen B. Senisi, All Kinds of Friends, Even Green! is an adventurous picture book for beginning readers about a real-life pet iguana. Expertly taken color photographs of a boy and his beloved reptile companion, along with whimsical text, make All Kinds Of Friends, Even Green! unique, distinctive, and highly recommended."
2,Tex Beneke as a vocalist is short-changed on this album.,"Not nearly enough of Tex's unique vocal stylings are the major drawback of this album. The arrangements and other vocalists are fine, but I missed Tex's smooth voice."
5,Great Product,"This armoire for my daughters American Girl doll is great! When I opened the package and found out how well it was made I really was amazed. I thought it would be workable, but it really is made to last. My daughter has it filled and loves it!"
4,Our generation Wooden Trunk is a Hit,"This was purchased for our little 3-year old granddaughter and she loves it. It is durable and she has played with it for hours, putting all of her doll's clothes in it."
4,When AG is over your budget..this is the brand to buy!,"My 7 year old has many AG dolls most given to her as gifts from family members. Struggling with the accessories to add to her collection is a constant as everything AG sells is so darn over-priced! I must say that I wasnt even happy about spending over 50 on this piece of furniture but I am glad I did. It is very roomy, it holds about 20 outfits (also generic brand lol), has racks for accessories and shoes, folds up nicely, very simple classic design (white finish with ribbon), and the additional doll vanity and stool is great for roll-play with the dolls. I will be searching for the bunk bed next and soon to review!"
4,Only one complaint,"I bought this for my 4-year old daughter as storage for all of her AG and Cabbage Patch doll clothes. She and I both love it. My only complaint is it does not come with any hangers. I wish it had come with at least a few. Other than that, it is a great toy."
4,quality worth the price,"Sturdy wooden (not plastic!) closet, nice quality. Even our two boys wanted and got their own after their two sisters each got one. The pink handle pull ties were easily swapped out for blue, and the pink tuff seat cover comes off easily too, making the boys happy.One star off for hinges which should be replaced with stronger ones, and hanging area needs to be taller for long outfits."
5,A walk through Jane Austen's world,"Mavis Batey takes the reader on a relaxed written tour of the pastoral Britain of Jane Austen's time. She has researched the philosophical and poetic background--Cowper, Gilpin, Rousseau, Repton and others--of the late 1700s and early 1800s to help the reader understand the literary climate that influenced Jane's own written portraits of life in her time. I particularly enjoyed the warm pictures she painted of Austen family life--as the Austens worked in their gardens and walked through their shrubberies . . Mavis connects each of Jane's books with Jane's response to the familial and intellectual landscape of the correlating time. And she does all this without wearying us. I think this is one book about Jane of which Jane would approve. I also found it in my university library, and I want it!"
3,"English and French, neat if you understand French.","I found out about Stephan eicher on a trip to France. I just saw an ad for him on the television and said ""Wow"" I really need to check this guy out. In terms of style he's hard to define. This is not really party music. It's more the kind of stuff you'd want on while driving or in small groups like a date or small dinner party.""Je n'ai pas d'ami comme toi"" Means 'I don't have any other friend like you' Quick pace, lively.""Dejuner en paix"" Means ""eat lunch in peace"" I never figured out that one.""Move a litle closer"" Is nice, but definetly date music. Very good."
4,Malevolent creation is one of best death metal bands!!,"I discovered malevolent creation in the movie CkY2k which is bams famous vidoes. I've had this cd for 2 months and it has not left my cd player. This cd has many great songs but the best song I think is the song ""Halved"". Go out and buy these cd right away!!!!!!!"
1,awful and disjointed,"This is a truly awful film. It is completely disjointed, the characters make no sense at all and there is a kind of claustrophobic aimlessness to the film that is difficult to describe. There is no story line and absolutely nothing happerns for ages. I just do not understand the scene where the two teenagers are openly laughing at eating an animals insides...this is like a bit of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Then you have Ian Smith (Harold from neighbours), what's he doing in this?Utter total rubbish."
2,What volume?,"Although I love the Pure Abundance shampoo and conditioner, i can do without this product. I see no difference in volume. Now for an updo, when you dont want a single hair to move, it would be fine, but you cant comb through it without breaking hair."
1,Product DID NOT Deliver!!!,"Bought this while I was in New Orleans. Got suckered in by the giant television screen displaying a model with big voluminous hair! Took it home, tried it and nothing! My hair is flatter to my scalp than if I'd used no product at all! And it smells awful! I live 2 1/2 hrs. from where I purchased it. Would be a waste of gas to return the product.:/"
1,Not good,"I ordered three items of Aveeda. One was this Pure Abundance Hair spray. Condtioner came within a very short while. Still waiting on the shampoo but the hair spray just arrived yesterday. Well, I used a tad on my hand to feel it and the odor of this product blew me away. Unlike another poster stating a devine smell, this smell was all but devine. It had a strong medicinal, alcohol, smell. I could not use this product and smell this bad. I called Amazon and they are taking care of this. Never again, will I buy health/beauty products on line."
5,Da LORDS!,I can't believe I am the second person to review this CD! HA! This CD is nuts! I love it. I like to think this band sounds like Black Flag on 375 mg of Ephedrine.Oh yea! It is on Jade Tree. So you know it's good!
5,Great color!,This baker arrived today and I am very pleased with size and color. It is perfect for my needs. Thanks
5,A fresh voice in Southern literature,"Laurie Pfister Taylor offers a fresh voice in Southern literature with her first novel, The Lille Pad: A Southern Tale. It's hard to find a book with the characters so fully developed that you'll feel you've known them all of your life -especially from a first-time author. And the story is solid -no holes in this one. Taylor captures the spirit of coastal living in South Carolina and Georgia -something rare today. Readers will feel like they are truly on a visit to the Atlantic coast when reading this book. Grab your robe and a cup of hot apple cider and curl up on the couch. This book is fun to read!"
3,Not that bad.,"I love zombie movies and in that case, this one is disappointing. Not your typical zombies. Aside from a couple, these act normal, talk, and aren't too interested in eating brains.I've seen some horrible b-movies that drag forever and this one isn't one of those. It is 75 minutes long and, to me, was entertaining. The story is puzzling and makes you shake your head. Some of the images and scenes are just haunting in the lack of people in this old big city. If this was seen in theaters, I'm sure there are a few moments that would make the audience jump.It's not a fantastic movie by any sense of the imagination, but it's not as bad as the two previous reviewers make it sound."
3,The dead don't die,"This is a great popcorn movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon. The plot is pretty simple...an innocent man is sent to the electric chair and his brother (George Hamilton) tries to find out the real suspect. Keep in mind this is a budget movie and if you are looking to get scared out of your wits, you might be disappointed. This is an earlier film for George Hamilton, and one of the last for Ray Milland. The opening scene of the falsely accused getting prepared for the electric chair(complete with priest) is quite dramatic. The Sound quality is not very good, but the movie does take the classic Zombie theme and gives it more of a lift (they talk and act normal)."
3,the dead could have been better!,"the dead dont die is an average made for tv movie,it has a good cast ray milland ,george hamilton,among others but the story is pretty slow.it is set during the thirties.a few spooky scenes but the end is a letdown but if it is a slow rainy night you might like it."
5,The World Needs More Text Books Like This,"I have two degrees. So the number of textbooks on my bookshelf is pretty large. This is by far the best textbook I have ever had to read. It is well laid out and easy to read.Thank you, thank you, thank you to the authors and publishers for giving the world a good example of a textbook that results in students actually learning. I am unequivocally more knowledgeable about eterprise systems for having read this book."
2,"Cute, but too small","It's adorable, but way too small - doesn't hold enough cream for more than one cup of coffee."
4,More comfortable than the ground indeed!,"This pad is durable and is rather comfortable to lay on. I'm a picky sleeper so sleeping on the ground isn't really an option for me as I'd just lie awake all night cursing the Gods. It inflates quickly and rolls up easily. I'm a big guy, 6'0"" tall and nearly 300 pounds, and the ""regular"" pad is JUST big enough for me. If I were any bigger or if this pad were any smaller I couldn't sleep on it on my back; I'd have to sleep on my side. If I could go back I'd probably purchase the next size up as it's significantly bigger. It's true that it's also 2x the weight (an extra 2 pounds) which may be worth it for that extra comfort unless pack space/weight is truly at a premium. It's also 2x the cost which seems a bit ridiculous to me.If you're a big guy and have a few extra bucks, buy the next size up, if not, this one will do."
5,GREAT PRODUCT DOESN'T DEFLTE WHEN IN USE,"ALPS SLEEPING AIR PADSI have used this product on long down-the-river paddling trips where I camped each night up to two weeks. No problem at all. Advice: Select the one that fits your type camping. Sounds kinda stupid to give this advice - don't buy a large and heavy model for back packing, don' select a thin model if you weigh 250 pounds. The pads do self inflate, give them extra thickness by blowing into the valves after the self-inflating stops. The larger pads take some time to expel the air while rolling the pad into a small roll for transporting. Again, my pad does not lose air when I sleep on it (and I weigh 220 lbs)."
5,Nicer than air bed!,"I had my air bed but require 4 x D size batteries to operate. Upon getting this item and opening it i got quite a suprise that it actually comes with a repair kit! This air pad eliminate the use of pumps and batteries making it more lightweight and environmentally friendly. It fits into a tent or hammock. My hip does not touch ground when fully lie down sidways, just blow more air into it and remember to close the valve if it's too soft. It act as a barrier from cold ground or mosquito bites in hammock. Use more time rolling up than set up but thats a good thing when you're tired and need sleep asap."
2,Does not deliver,"This is a great idea, but that's simply all it is. It does not fill with air like its suppose to. You will have to blow it up."
5,Perfect for canoe-camping,"I've used it once and I love it. It's compact, yet comfortable, and very well made. For the price, you can't beat it."
3,Good Camping Mat!,This camping mat works well and is very comfortable. A negative for me is that it doesn't roll up as small as I thought it would.
3,Provides no Comfort,"This air pad is hard and provides very little comfort or back support. It may be of less concern to mountaineers who mostly care about the weight of their backpack but I mostly do hiking from camps I get to by car, so I will be returning this pad in favor of something softer."
4,Great Buy,"Used this mat for the first time on a camping trip in October. The temps were down to the 40's, and I was completely comfortable with the mat beneath my sleeping bag. I wasn't cold (at least from the floor temp.) The cushioning is nice, although I blew into it a few times while I was getting impatient for it to self-inflate the first time. I'm keeping it inflated in a spare room, and it's supposed to reduce the inflation speed by quite a bit.The bag is really light and easy to carry (I like that it came with a bag!) and has a nice repair kit tucked in. The straps come off when it's time to inflate, but I just stuff it into the little pocket that the repair kit is in, and it hasn't been a problem. I suspect that once you roll it up nice, you won't need the straps anyway.It's a little narrow, but who thrashes around in a mummy sleeping bag, anyhow? Overall, great, great buy."
4,good nights sleep,"I got this for my husband since he has a bad back. Regular size since we wanted to limit the size and weight added to his pack. Does a great job for it's size and is easy to use. Remove from pouch, unscrew caps to allow air in and let it do it's thing...added a few blows of air to get it a bit puffier to his liking and tighten the caps back on! to repack, unscrew, roll up tightly forcing air out the valves...remember to re-tighten the caps on the valves to keep it from re-inflating. good value and is lighter than a regular vinyl air mattress."
2,Decent but brass air valve is flawed,"This is a decent air mattress, but the brass valve is proving unreliable. We've had this mattress for just over two years and used it quite a bit. Now the brass air valve is sticking and will not allow the mattress to inflate or deflate. There does not appear to be a way to repair the valve, so our mattress may be taking up space in a landfill soon."
1,Strongly not recommended,"Item doesnt work as the video shows. I bought the regular size and in the description it says that it will inflate up to 1.5 inches, but it didnt even get close to 1 inch!!"
5,comfortable,"Very nice, body doesn't touch ground. First pad so I'm not really sure what to compare it to. From what I see,it was easy to pack and easy to store away. Hope to test it out when I go camping."
3,Expected better quality from Under Armour,"Great looking socks. My grandson loved them. But after only two wears I was sewing up holes. They seemed pretty loosely woven which is probably why they don't hold up very well. Or maybe my grandson is just hard on socks, although I don't remember ever having to mend socks for him. I expected better quality from Under Armour."
1,Waste of time,This book did not deliver the product as advertised. This book quotes from the New Testament and makes references to occurrences that didn't take place until the 18th century.
2,A bit odd...,"I actually got this book free on gutenbergs site, forgive my spelling. Many of the passages talk about things that happened way after Aristotle's time. It talks about the ""Savior"" and Aristotle wouldn't have been around during the time of Christianity. It talks about St. Paul. That was way after Aristotle. I am not sure who the authors were but they probably were just take bits and pieces of Aristotle's work and adding to it. I thought I was imagining things at first when I read various passages from the Bible. I have nothing against religion Aristotle couldn't have written all this. I wishe they would put the other authors names or explain these as being about his work and not ""his"" work."
1,The Works of Aristotle,"It was too much for me. I did not really understand it so therefore I did not enjoy it. I will re read it, but I do not think that I will enjoy it."
1,cant find bulb,I purchased this strobe light for my son. It was fun while it lasted - which wasnt very long. The bulb went out and I am still trying to find a replacement. The company listed on the product apparently is no longer in business. Fun toy - if you can find bulbs. I'd check BEFORE I buy to find replacement bulbs.
1,Blue Streak Pneumatic Air Rifle,"Item was listed as a ""handcrafted american walnut stock"" but it actually was a hardwood with a walnut finish and it was stated so on the box. Other sites offer this same pellet rifle with hardwood stock, at a lesser price, but I chose this site because I wanted a better quality stock which I didn't get. Paid higher, got less."
2,Horrible book,"James White did a great job. Unfortunately Dave Hunt was AWOL.Mr. Hunt must be a terrific dancer because he was wandering all over the place.Dr. White did very good unfortunately Mr. Hunt just didn't engage.It's obvious that Mr. Hunt has never read Calvin's Institutes.He seems to quote others who have, but has little first hand knowledge of Calvinism himself.VERY BAD research on Mr. Hunts part."
3,YIPE - Is White's God similar to Hitler???,"In this book, James White makes God sound like Hitler (as many Calvinists do)- like he's up there somewhere, picking and choosing, the ""elect"" and taking delight in exterminating the rest of unlovely humanity - why would anyone want to serve such an unloving God? Why do Calvinists want to invent such a God? The God of scripture loves his creation - John 3:16 means what it says: For God so loved the world, that he gave His only begotten Son, what WHOSOEVER believeth in Him, should not perish but have everlasting life. Mr. White has to change the definition of 3 words in this verse: loved, world, whosoever. A child should be able to read John 3:16 and understand it....if we all believed as Mr. White does, the only people who could understand the Bible would have to have several degrees after their name. I personally enjoyed Dave Hunt's arguments, even tho' he wasn't as scholarly as the condescending Mr. White. Whatever happened to the simple gospel?"
3,another book to read...,"While interesting, this book doesn't give any good arguments exegetically. Hunt, like Geisler, is a philosopher and not an exegetical scholar. He admits freely that his arguments come from more of a philosophical stance, so that is what you are going to get whenever you read Hunt. White, on the other hand, simply repeats exegetical work already done via Grudem and Ware. By not going deep enough exegetically, White ends up with circular reasoning to prove his points.If you want in-depth exegetical work on these topics, you really have read C. Gordon Olson's ""Beyond Calvinism and Arminianism: An Inductive, Mediate Theology of Salvation."" For a compilation of reformed writers and their numerous disagreements, see Vance's ""The Other Side of Calvinism."" And for more exegetical work, see Dillow's ""The Reign of the Servant Kings."""
5,Thanks for opening my eyes to the REAL GOD of the BIBLE!,"This author seems to be the best contender of calvinism. He exposes the false calvinist doctrinal system by pure scripture, revealing the true character of GOD."
3,Some informative material,"A bit lopsided - the Calvinist proponent seems to be more deeply informed than Hunt - however, both make some good points. My conclusion: believe like a Calvinist regarding eternal security, but behave like an Arminian!"
3,two different Gods,"The calvinists and arminians have two differnt Gods. The Calvinist GOD is an Deity that creates,preserves,governs,and disposes of all of his creation. He decides and causes all things that happen,including the unconditional salvation and damnation of sinners. The Arminian god is a user friendly toady that takes his orders from men. This is why a Jack Hayford and others teach that God wills as man wills. It,s a no-brainer why most sinners love and choose the Arminian deity."
2,Heat: 4 stars; Light: 2 stars,"The debate that takes place in this book consists of two professional apologists talking past each other.Or, to be fair to James White, it consists of one apologist trying to have a constructive debate with another apologist who doesn't seem to be listening.If you are hoping to be persuaded by the best arguments that each position (Calvinism/non-Calvinism) has to offer, you may want to keep looking.On the other hand, if you are looking for a handy reference on what a poor debate looks like in print, by all means, rush out and buy the book. You will not be disappointed."
5,great discontinued product,"THis product is one of the best you can use ,holds a hair style really great. matrix has discontinued this spritz spray and the regular aresol does not work the same. The only place you can get this is on line but be aware of imatations ."
5,An essential text for debaters of all levels!,"Students of debate will love this book that clearly weaves together the essential characteristics of great oratory. This is the only debate text that I've found that provides a practical guide to debate tournament administration as well as the structure of debate itself. Professor Branham focuses on ""policy"" style debate, but ""Debate and Critical Analysis"" is still a must read for rhetors of any stripe"
3,Mixed feelings :( vs :),I had abdonminal surgery at the time 4 weeks post-op. I loved the compression and that this was not so bulky. By week 2 I had a rash and itched like crazy.I used some hydrocortisone and it went away after 2-3 days . I started usinging it again right after and broke out 3 days later. I would wear it all day at work 8 hrs. I'm not sure what made me break out but when I cut off a strip to put it on my scar and held it down with my medical binder or my underwear I never broke out. I may wear it now only if I'm wearing something a bit more form fitting. It stays in place and you never have to pull it up or down like the compression garments you get from the doc.
3,"Overall, it serves its purpose.","This belt is definitely a cheaper alternative for applying silicone sheeting on the skin, but my only complaint was that the belt is kinda ""thick"" thus making somewhat ""inflexible""...it just doesnt conform to my shape very well because it has a stiff fabric backing on the other side. I definitly can not wear it without wearing a compression garment on top because the belt will simply not stay on and adhere on its own...even with the velcro strips.But you do get 272 square inches of silicone sheeting for 70 bucks, so I guess I cant complain too much."
1,something is wrong with this gelzone belt!,"This is the second gelzone belt that I have purchased. The first one was perfect. It provided great support and lasted 4 weeks. I was so pleased that I promptly ordered a second one. I think this product has been used! It is falling apart, in the same way that my first one did after 4 weeks! Only I have only worn this one for two days. I definently got a lemon, and am upset because I can't send it back. This is an expensive product. I also paid for 2 day shipping and I didn't receive the product until day 6.I am upset. I really loved my first gelone belt. I think someone has scammed me with this one though."
5,Fits pretty well and well made,"I had previously bought a Size 1 in another brand. It was too small. #3 was too big.When I decided on getting the #1 Quick Fit Dog Muzzle, it was because I thought it may fit.It fits pretty well. I had to put it on the tightest setting, but then it works.It took my dog about 10 minutes to stop trying to take it off. Then he was finally good with it on.This is a well-made muzzle and I would recommend it. But know your dog's size so you won't end up with 3 muzzles."
4,Muzzle size difference between companies.,"I have a muzzle that is size 1 from another manufacture, so when I bought size 2 of this muzzle it turned out to be too big for my dog, so I will have to order a size 1 to fit the dog I bought the size 2 for. Not a lost sale though, as I have a larger dog that the size 2 fits well on. Verify brands before purchasing replacement muzzles, measure measure measure."
2,Ineffective!,"My dog was able to remove the muzzle by sliding the strap over his head within minutes. I would not recommend this product for pet owners who have escapists as pets, but it may work well for the more docile dogs."
5,dog muzzle,"This muzzle is the perfect muzzle for those times when you suspect your dog might nip or bite.It is a simple, quick and comfortable solution when needed."
2,Not For the Escapist!,"The muzzle fitted too tightly on my Golden Retriever and she was able to remove it within minutes by pushing the strap over her head. Overall, I'm not satisfied with the product. Since I got it for about half the price currently stated, I did not bother to send it back for a refund."
2,Inaccurate Sizing,"If you have a larger breed dog (GSDs, Labradors, Huskies, etc.), beware of the sizing.I decided to buy one of these muzzles for my 9 month old German Shepherd for when he goes to the Vet. The sizing information on the packaging and the website are all way off so I didn't really get to test it out. They both suggest a size 3 for GSDs, but in reality, the size 3 is half of what my dog would need. And my dog is standard size, so he's not over-sized or anything.I returned this and ordered a Size 4XL. Hopefully that will fit."
2,You Get What you Pay For,"The muzzle appears to be new, but it did not come in a package (as pictured on website). It looks like seller is buying bulk items and then re-selling them. Cheap price ($5.39), but muzzle is very stiff (backpack type material)with somewhat rough seems. I had to guess at the size since it was not stated. I got an extra large because I have a Chow-Newfoundland mix. It is a little on the big side. I plan on just using it when my dog has to have his nails trimmed at vet (they ask for this). Since my dog is not a biter or chewer it works ok. However, if you have a dog that has to wear a muzzle for an extended period of time, is a biter or tries to get muzzles off, this is NOT the product you want to get.Note: The product may be lacking, but seller shipped the product quickly and was very nice to work with."
1,Return Policy,"I ordered a dog muzzle and I thought the seller was DogStuff-4u. The product was actually shipped from another seller - Absolutely Pets. Unfortunately, the muzzle was too big for my dog so I wanted to return it. Absolutely Pets charged 20% restocking fee plus shipping fee according to the return policy. What return policy? I could not find the return policy anywhere. Not in Amazon. Not in Absolutely Pets. Not in DogStuff-4u. With this kind of charges, it was not worth to return it. If you want to order products from DogStuff-4u or Absolutely Pets, you better hope you do not need to return them. Will not place order with DogStuff-4u and Absolutely Pets again."
1,This sucks don't buy it!,This toy made it 1 day and my son is quiet and peaceful. He is not hard on anything and this toy folded and died the first day and went in the trash. The metal inside the edges to make it take shape is like the slinky metal. Once it starts going the wrong way you are toast! Don't buy it! Even if it's free it will just take up room in your trash and break your sons heart! He cried for hours because he loves Power Rangers.
4,7 Secrets worth a try,"If you appreciate Catholicism for its extensive and detailed Cathecism which you use to relieve yourself of thoughtful prayer, divine guidance, and ethical reflection in your daily life, this book is not for you. On the other hand; if you view all you do through the lens of its traditions and teachings, seek to understand how to live true to that lens each day in a modern and messy world, and are humble enough to acknowledge that you screw it up regularly in spite of yourself, give this book a try. It is actually very encouraging."
4,Imp Bottle is a classic trick for kids,"This is a favorite quick trick with my kids, ages 6 to 14. Now their friends are asking for one! I was happy to find these quirky little magic tricks online and quickly purchased a few for my children's friends. It is an easy trick for 5th and 6th graders to practice and perform. They can easily stump an adult with just a little practice."
4,Imp Bottle Trick,"Easy trick with very little partice.Fools kids and most alduts.The rod that makes it work can get lost, if so, can be replaced with piece cut from nail."
1,REMASTERED VINYL COPY - POOR QUALITY,This is such a poorly remastered product it is akin to listening to music as if one were listening to a somehat scratchy vinyl recording. Couldn't whoever remastered these songs have paid a little more attention to how some of the songs sounded before releasing this compilation? I bought this CD under the impression I'd be getting a quality product (or something close to it). I'm pretty disappointed to say the least. I will stay away from any Hallmark CD released in the future.Wonderful Wonderful
5,quality product,this handy little gadget helps me with my small bench projects when i find myself trying to position more than a couple things around a solder point. this one came wrapped in a retail plastic pack fully assembled and arrived in about a week. permanent addition to my bench and sets next to my vice. keeper!
4,Perfectly price appropriate - well made,"This is a tool for a reasonably sophisticated hobbyist. The base is heavy cast iron, and overall, it's quite well made. Keep in mind, you're not paying a lot of money for this! Read the dimensions in the description carefully too... If you base your purchase solely on the photo, there's a little bit of optical illusion taking place.. This is by no means a criticism, I'm just saying, read the dimensions... It's not as big as you might think if you just go by the photo. Also a byproduct of the size, to use effectively, you need to be seated right in front of it on a work desk.Realistically, the wingnuts are small (as they need to be), so you can't always get quite enough leverage to loosen or tighten them while using, so plan on keeping a pair of pliers handy for fine adjustments."
2,Needs a better quality everything,Well i had bought a similiar one at a cheap store many years ago and it was ok for the money. This one was about the same price so I decided to give it a try. The one is a piece of junk and was from day one. It will not hold anything still. Just cheap imported junk
3,not bad but needs help,base could be heavier and the locking wing nuts and bolts your going to have to get 2 pairs of pliers to tighten them down enough so that they dont move but the plus side is that once you do that you don't have to move them again usually
2,Cheap,"That one word describes this one. There are a lot of versions that I've found of this - priced from ""inexpensive"" (this model) to 30+ bucks. You do get what you pay for. But it does work for most things - but the base is not steady enough IMO. and the magnifier doesn't cut it."
3,Texton magnifier,"I used the Texton 7521 magnifier to help in making jewelry. It's OK but the base is not heavy enough to support the magnifier at an extended position. I will have to add another base to it..Probably a larger base that extend to the ""front"" more."
4,Gets the job done,"It is what it is. The knobs could be a little easier to turn, but that is being picky. It works great, can't beat the price, this is a must for home soldering."
3,Meh,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this product comes just thrown into a box with all the clamps loose so it can fold down compactly in the box. There was a cardboard sleeve around the magnifying glass to protect it, but it had fallen off. There is a small crack in the lens as a result. It will not effect my use though. I have another one I can use if needed anyway. I bought it more for the clamps and the stand.It was very easy to get all the parts pointed where I wanted. It does take a bit of nimble fingers though. The base is well weighted, and as long as you keep the center of gravity reasonable I don't foresee it tipping over.All in all, I only paid around $8 for it with free shipping so I am very happy with my purchase. -1 star for the crack in the lens, and -1 for the packaging. Otherwise a 5 star product IMO."
4,Decent third hand,The base could be a little larger as it is prone to tip over but other than that this is a good helping hand. I would recommend drilling holes in the base to mount it on a solid surface or using a small vise with it.
2,"It'll do, but I wish I'd gotten something better","This is a low-end item. The magnifying glass is housed loosely in a metal ring, and that metal ring only stays attached to the device due to minor friction between it and the attachment point.It'll do, for the most part, but I really wish I'd gotten something better."
4,Small but handy,"This is a good piece of equipment, the base is soild, as well as the arms. The magnifier is small but fairly strong. It came put togeather which was helpfull. Arrived quickly. Good bargain."
2,The Laws of Invisible Things,"Without going into elaborate detail, I find it necessary to report that this book is NOT one I would recommend to anyone. The protagonist Dr. Grant blunders about in a plotline that is so weak that Huyler fails to deliver a conclusion. This book goes absolutely nowhere, and I regret the time I invested in reading it through to the end. The blurbs promise a medical thriller like The Hot Zone or Darwin's Radio, but Huyler's novel is a paltry wanna-be. A doctor who writes a book can throw in a lot of medical jargon, but what he needs is a solid plot -- not one based on ""invisible things!"""
4,Good book,"Good, but Frank Huyler's other books: The Blood of Strangers, and Right of Thirst are the really outstanding ones. Don't miss these."
1,just fades away.,"invisible things is a well written novel for about two thirds of its length, then it just fades away. it is like the author ran out of material or got bored with the project. the basic theme of search for a new disease, is well told and tension builds nicely. but then, as i have said, it just goes nowhere. i'd skip it. dgs"
2,Disappointing,The book was reasonably well written but it was very disappointing at the end. He did not resolve the major mystery in the novel. I thought that they accidently left out the last chapter.
2,Disappointing!,"This book presents the first part of an interesting plot and then drops it in favor of an analysis of human relationships. Unlike the other negative reviewers who found the first two thirds of the book adequate, I found the entire book to be an amateurish attempt to write like Hemingway: short, staccato sentences, laden with deep meaning but in Huyler's case, signifying almost nothing. I enjoyed the excellent descriptions of medical procedures in the office and the hospital (I'm an MD) and kept expecting an interesting, even if fictional, medical solution. Instead, the book ends with nothing resolved. Frustrating!"
5,CHER IS SOOOO GREAT,CHER HAS BEEN IN THE MUSIC WORLD FOR SO LONG THAT LISTENERS EXPECT GOOD MUSIC. AND THAT'S EXACTALLY WHAT THEY GET WITH THIS CD. CHER'S VOICE IS STILL WOUNDERFUL AND SHE'S REALLY GREAT.
5,"Espectacular, GENIAL!","EL SINGLE STRONG ENOUGH ES SIMPLEMENTE GENIAL!, NO HAY MAS PALABRAS PARA DESCRIBIR ESTA ESPECTACULAR PRODUCCION DE MI GRAN ID0LA Y DIOSA CHER! TE AMO CHER, ERES LO MAXIMO!, LAS MEJORES VERSIONES SON; CLU69 PHUNK MIX, Y CLUB69 FUTURE ANTHEM MIX EDIT, CHER ERES LEJOS LA MEJOR! 1"
2,Unintentionally amusing,"Cher had such a promising first single from the album ""Believe"", but she goofed up with the muck that is ""Strong enough"". The song is little more than a remake of ""I will survive"" (with the exception being that ""I will survive"" is the best disco song ever recorded), and the remixes are uninteresting. The exception is the Marc Andrews mix, which is kinda fun.For a clone in terms of Club 69 mixes, try Madonna's ""Nothing Really Matters"", which differs in quality with ""Strong enough"" because it was a good song to begin with."
2,FAIR DISCO SONG FOR A B SIDE BUT NOT AS A SINGLE.,"Cher has so many better songs on her CD ""Believe"" besides this weak disco waterdown mess ""Strong Enough"", which isn't. Try other dance confections like ""Runaway"" or ""Taxi Taxi"", or better yet ""All or Nothing"" - that should be the song of choice for the clubs. Forget your money on this one and buy the full length album for the stronger dance songs."
1,"DICK, IT HAS NO BEAT AND IT IS NOT EASY TO DANCE TO.","I love Cher when it comes to movies like ""Moonstruck"", ""Mask"", etc., but when it comes to singing she never really had the talent. Cher is more an actress than a singer. Her voice is very weak, furthermore this song sounds like a disco 70s retread, trying to recapture the popularity of ""I Will Survive"", but the song has no structure to say the least and is definitely one of the weaker songs on Chers ""Believe"" CD. They should of released ""All or Nothing"" or ""Taxi Taxi"", two stronger dance songs that do have a good beat and are easy to dance to."
2,"Awful, but catchy","I thought this song was awful when I first heard it. (I thought the entire cd was awful, actually). BUT, like Believe, I can't seem to get it out of my head! That doesn't mean I'm happy about it, but its there!"
1,NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP MY FOOD DOWN.,"This is actually one of the weakest songs from the CD ""Believe"". First it sounds like a total ripoff of Gloria Gaynors ""I Will Survive"", with disco synthesizers, lyrics and all. Further more Chers voice is in weak form."
3,Decent VHS copies of NASA Apollo 13 and Soyuz Reports,"This SP VHS tape was actually transferred from two 30-minute NASA Apollo mission film reports originally released not long after the Apollo 13 mission in 1970 and the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. Since the original film was 16 mm the definition is not up to present day standards but the color is fairly good.I saw the original Apollo 13 report (Houston, We've Got a Problem) back during my tenure at the Goldstone Manned Space Flight Network tracking station during the Apollo missions. This is a good addition to my collection of Apollo videos. However the 1994 WGBH PBS video ""Apollo 13, To the Edge and Back,"" also available is more comprehensive and better technically.Bill Wood, Retired Apollo Systems Engineer"
3,"Great story, but poorly executed documentary","I give Michael Potter three stars just for recognizing and choosing to attempt to document this story. The subtitle ""The Greatest Space Story Never Told"" is appropriate. I can't believe I had never heard of this, and had to order the DVD as soon as I came across it. However, Potter missed a prime opportunity to educate future space entrepreneurs.Instead of trying to expose and discuss the flaws in thinking and execution that caused MirCorp to fail, the film focuses on glamorizing the ""rebel alliance of entrepreneurs"". Hip phrases such as ""anarcho-capitalist"" and romantic depictions of pirate flags abound. It would be great to see a real business documentary on this subject, a la[....] orEnron: The Smartest Guys in the Room. For now, those who wish to succeed where MirCorp failed will have to extract the key issues themselves."
4,Good Book,This book has been very helpful for me in writing my novel. This information is presented in very clear terms and is easy to understand.
1,Don't waste your money,"After reading some of the reviews and with Sidney Poitier and Richard Widmark, I was expecting a good old fashioned movie. I am pretty well able to enjoy any of the old movies but this one was terrible. My wife gave up and about 1/2 hour but I struggled with it for about 75 minutes, always waiting for some gem or scene that would make the time worth while. It was never forthcoming. Save you money for something else to watch."
2,Save your money,It was laughabler. It was beginners acting for all the major stars. It .took me back to the 50's for sure.
3,They don't make em like this anymore!,Get ready to smile at the antics of the flim flam man Viking hero! An old fashion style movie with much comedic relief. Very light and good entertainment.
3,"Hey, try reading the Book","The movie is just a routine Hollywood eviseratation of a great book. I would recommend you try to find a copy of the book and give it a try. It is on my list of the top 10 books of all time. You will find out what life as a real Viking was like, not Hollywood's mediocre interpretation."
2,Strange Movie,"Generally I watch a movie like this for nothing more than entertainment. As such, I really didn't expect a lot from it. Even so, this movie was a disappointment. The acting is marginal and the story line impossible. For example, Vikings taking over a Moorish fortress in the desert? Or a solid gold bell that is as high as three tall men that floats when it hits the water? Or how about a viking ship towing that bell (which would weigh several tons) on a small raft? All in all, this is one strange movie."
3,Mediocre film based on a great but little read novel,"Like most reviewers here I saw this film when I was a kid, and at the time loved it. In fact, I saw it many times and loved it until.... in high school I got around to reading an English translation of the Swedish novel it was very loosely and I mean VERY LOOSELY based on, ""The Long Ships"" or ""Red Orm"" by Frans Bengtsson, one of the best selling novels ever printed in Sweden. The book blew me away and anyone else I've met in the last 40 years that ever read it also recalls it as one of the best novels they ever read. For me this film this is an extraordinary example of how a great piece of literature can get mangled almost beyond recognition by Hollywood into a silly but mildly entertaining motion picture."
1,HORRIBLE!,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER WATCHED. I ONLY WATCHED PART OF IT BEFORE I THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE. TERRIBLE ACTING. SILLY PLOT. JUST A RIDICULOUS MOVIE.
4,Incredibly stupid but also incredibly enjoyable,"The Long Ships is a wildly enjoyable and utterly ridiculous adventure romp where everyone knows they're not making a work of art here and just has fun. Well, maybe everyone but Sidney Poitier's villainous Moor, who doesn't seem to be in on the joke, although he really should have been able to tell from the casting - Richard Widmark and Russ Tamblyn play Oskar Homolka's sons searching for mythical giant golden bell ""The Mother of Voices"" while their Viking crew includes the likes of Gordon Jackson, Colin Blakely and David Lodge, with Lionel Jeffries turning up in blackface as a rather bizarre mute eunuch in a harem scene that was clearly a major influence on Carry On Up the Khyber. The only downside is some very dubious looking illegal horsefalls.Columbia's DVD boasts a good widescreen transfer and includes the original theatrical trailer but is slightly cut - none of the offending horsefalls, but a slave auction sequence."
4,Swashbuckler in the old hollywood tradition!,"I saw this one at the old MAYFAIR theatre in Ottawa in 64,and have never forgotten it! I own it on VHS, but it would be a great full-screen epic to watch on DVD if it becomes available! Sidney Poitier is excellent as the Saracin lord who is obsessed with the legend of the Golden Bell! Richard widmark has always been one of my favourite actors, and this picture is non-stop thrills,from his daring escape at the beginning of the picture to his;and his viking cohorts brush with "" the mare of death "" (Sids' unique way of dispatching his enemies), near the end. A winner on all counts! - R.L."
5,Vikings Rule!,"This is my favorite Viking movie of all time. If you enjoy action, babes, hunks and humor you will love this movie."
2,Not all that good.,"This one would have been impossible to watch were it not for its pretty good costume and set design. It looked as though at the beginning that this was going to be a decent medieval tale of adventure, but horribly cheesy dialogue and subpar acting soon put an end to that. Sadly not even the presence of Poitier can save this movie. There's only so much a great actor can do with such a bad script, surrounded by bad actors, and forced to sport such a lame hair-doo."
1,Hot buttered adventure,"This movie plays like the second part of a double-bill matinee. Only die-hard fans of viking period pieces, or unconvincing adventure movies of the 60's, should bother watching it. The film makes one wonder how Richard Widmark stayed in the business more than a week..."
4,History In The Making,"This film depicts the adventures of two Norsemen who team together to find a fabeled bell of soilid gold. To start off, the two brothers steal the Norse King's funeral ship; kidnap the King's dauhter: then, they battle a mutinous crew; and finally, they face opposition from the resident Moores. The all-star cast thatbrings this action-packed adventure: The two brothers are played by Richard Widmarkand Russ Tamblyn; the Moorish opposition is led by Sidney Poiter. Raging battles,daring escapes, and a little humor thrown in too. A thoroughly enjoyabledescription of Viking adventures."
5,Not Until Star Wars,"I loved this movie as a child. Even as a young boy I realized this was a fun, tongue-in-cheek adventure film... closer to a fairy tale than to a realistic serious yarn. I loved it.Over the years there weren't many films of this type produced. It wasn't until a decade and a half later when Star Wars hit the big screen that I got to see another variation of the elements which make the Long Ships great. While critics missed the point of Star Wars and compared it to 2001: A Space Odyssey, I could instantly see that Lucas was far more influenced (story-wise) by films such as the Long Ships than he was 2001. In order to enjoy either film, you have to leave reality behind and become a kid again.If you find science and history class more fun than reading a fairy tale, you won't like this film. But, if you enjoy a good story and your imagination gets caught-up in the story-teller's drama, and you want to be told that anything is possible... have fun watching the Long Ships!"
5,The Long Ships,"The Long ShipsThis was one of my favourite Saturday afternoon at the movies adventure movie that I was adicted to as a kid. It is very easy to enjoying this DVD for its high spirited adventure the pure nostalgic factor without having to lament that it is basically a B movie - a pretty good B movie. Besides it is a great popcorn with the kids movie and will likely be just as well received by the grandkids in a few years. Based on the enjoyable story line, it would be nice if they remade this movie, the Vikings, and Alfred the Great to the modern LOTR type standard."
1,Don't Buy,"I bought this video for my Parenting class and it is horribly boring. There is nothing on the screen other than four hours of doctors talking. I was expecting some examples and pictures - nothing. It is informative, but there are better movies out there I am sure."
2,boring and not informative,"I turned it off after a few minutes because its basically a slide show presentation of words + narration, barely any videos, and the images seem like they're from the 90's.I suggest purchasing Laugh and Learn about child birth. Much more interesting and informative, as if you were in an actual child birth class."
4,Portrait of a Marriage,"This is a vivid, moving portrait of a marriage told in the couple's own words to one another. While biographer and commentators on the Fitzgeralds and their period have provided their own interpretations of the most famous exemplars of the Jazz Age, Breyer and Barks have chosen to let the protagonists speak for themselves and to each other. The result is a look at two human beings struggling to find their identities, define their relationship, and establish their place in the world relative to one another. That they only partially succeeded but never stopped trying is what makes this collection of their letters compelling reading.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know what the world looked like to those living in, and often trapped in, its confines."
2,So funny,THe movie was not absolutely bad but sure was funny watching a bunch of rich kids trying to be gangsta...lol... then they fell into a mess and surprise surprise poor lil rich white gurl cry rape..
1,HAVOC,"It's nothing but a group of spoiled/wigger white kids who think there tough while Anne and her friend(s) try to be in a gang.ALTHOUGH IT'S WEIRD SEEING ANNE HATHAWAY GO FROM GOOD GIRL TO BAD GIRL THROUGHOUT MOVIES. AND OF COURSE THAT WHORE BIJOU IS IN THIS AWFUL MOVIE. IT'S NOT SUPRISING THAT SHE'S STILL PLAYING A TEENAGER.IN CONCLUSION, THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME THAT DIDN'T HAVE A PLOT AT ALL!!!!"
3,Bree-Ann's Review,This movie is crazy. Not at all what you would expect of someone who stars in disney movies. It was awesome... I would roll dice to that.
4,Real Hard Bad a** movie,"I try to see every controversial film about sex, drugs and badd as* kids. Anne H. and Bijou who is mmy fave in all controversial films. But she did'nt show her bad a** style as usual she was a follower anne was the leader. It suprised me how they wanted to be something they could never be. They were all just scared kids with boring lives tryig to find something real to corrupt their minds.Suprising ending it made me upset that the ending did not have more depth see it for yourself if you like kids, bullly, tart, new best friend then this will be put on your shelf."
3,It's not that bad,"Reading some of the negative reviews of this film, you'd think it's a major stinker. It's not. Good acting by the principle players. Good story. Sad characters doing stupid things but that's reality. I'm not sure how much the two main characters changed in the end; both seemed destined to remain clueless. Now if you want a bad movie watch Seed of Chucky or Underworld 2."
4,Havoc,Havoc was a pretty good movie. It depicts a fairly accurate picture between real thugs and fake ones. It also shows how teenagers curiosity can get them into serious trouble. Only problem with the movie is the directors inept ending.
3,Wrong Girl for This Movie,"I'm sure this happens all the time in CA, but I'm not sure Anne Hathaway was the right choice to star in it. She's simply too good looking. Yes, great that she has no qualm with appearing naked, but she looked out of place. Good story, good acting but those thugs from 'Training Day' are getting stereotyped."
3,OK MOVIE,I am not going to ruin the plot for you. I paid about $7 for this DVD. If I took my wife to the movies it would have been 3 or 4 times as expensive. For $7 it was worth a look.
2,If you wanted to see this,"only to see Anne Hathaway topless, you're almost as pathetic as this film was. The plot was lame, a real shame because it actually had all kinds of potential. And for what her role was, Hathaway wasn't bad, nor was Rodriguez, but they had absolutely nowhere to go within the parameters of the script.In short, the film wasn't entertaining in the least, unless you're a prepubscent boy. No wonder it went straight to video. When the credits roll, you say, ""And......???"""
1,Pure Garbage,This movie is my number one worst movie of 2005.I never seen a bunch of rich wannabe's trying so hard to be someone else.The whole storyline was straight garbage...........
3,Havoc,"I am not a big-time movie critic, but I rate this movie 3 stars because I thought the ending could have been a bit better. Some parts where too dramatic especially how they imitate both worlds. The acting was not great but the story is good, the entertaining part is trying to figure if in the end Anne's character learns a positive lesson."
2,WHY UNRATED??,"Im not sure what the point of the unrated version was, there is a difference of 8 minutes between the R and the unrated version, if i cut 8 minutes (including in particular one scene not involving hathaway) out of the unrated version, I could wind up with a PG-13 film...Ive seen much worse in R rated films.all the alleged anne hathaway nude scenes (which to be completely frank was my motivation for buying this movie) with the exception of 2 breast shots less than 30 seconds long were apparently cut before released on dvd. and just an ""ok"" movie at best otherwise. if you are motivated for the same reasons, I wouldnt necessarily recommend it."
2,Terrible is too kind a word.,A poorly formulated film with just as bad dialogue. It really offers nothing to the viewer other than bad acting and unrealistic events filled with tired cliches. Is movie making an art anymore? Judging from this film i suspect not.
1,Havoc is a bust,"The movie I thought would be great because of the main actress in the film. Also staring in my favorite movies such as The Princess Diaries, and Ella Enchanted. However her acting was poor and lacking in my opinion. The plot was stupid and just ran on without really any where to go at all...very disappointed after all the great talk about the movie.."
3,Havoc,"This movie is a bit disturbing as it shows teenagers thinking they are smarter than they actually are. These two girls, Allie and Emily, inspite of their upper class upbringing, seek to join a Latin gang. They claim they are bored and are looking for excitement. The problem is they don't realize that the Latin gang plays for keeps and these girls are really nothing more than high school seniors.The film should cause alarm for parents of young girls as this type of behavior, though overdramtatized for the movie, is not too far from the truth. Too many young girls think they can handle the situations live presents but then find things area lot more complicated than they are capable of dealing with.The acting, especially Anne Hathaway, is good. Freddy Rodriguez is a convincing gangster. The story moves reasonably well and the plot is plausible. I think the emotions of the parents were downplayed, but overall this is not a bad movie. But watch it at your own risk as it is quite graphic."
1,What In The World,"I Am A Big Fan Of Anne. I Have Seen All Of Her Movies. This Film Was Bad. A Bunch Of Rich White Teens Acting Like There A Gangster Rapper Living In The Hood Come On. There Are People Of All Types That Live In Those Places For Real And Not Faking It Like In The Movie. I Know Anne Wanted To Do Something Other Then Disney Kid Films. Her Role Was Crappy. She Can Do Better Then That. I Mean This Film Was Like At Wedding Where They Play A Rap Tune And The old White Lady's Try To Act Like It(Save It For ""Scary Movie""). That's Not Funny Its Sad. I Like Rap And I Have Nothing Against It. But The monkey See Monkey Do Thing Good God. If Anne Or Her Friends Read this. Don't Take It The Wrong Way. Your A Great Actress And Any Role You Play Will Be Great. Just Please Don't Use Better Judgment Next Time. On The Plus Side You Do Have A Great Voice You Should Do Recorded An Album."
1,Pretty Bad in many ways,"Even if you were given this DVD it would not be worth it - you would waste your time in watching it.The movie, throughout, seems to be trying to make some sort of weighty statement but nothing comes out. The plot is unconvincing as are many of the actors in their roles.If you are looking for some skin, there is almost nothing of interest here. One of the reasons I bought this is that Shiri Appleby is listed third in the credits, but she gets almost no screen time."
2,Unrealistic and Uneventful,"Very contrived, poor acting, poor dialog, weak story. The trailer didn't even hold my interest so I should have known better."
3,"Princess Mia Meets Gang Bang, Meets Gang Bang",OHHHH MYYYY GAWD!I don't know if this an accurate portrayal of bored rich chicks in L.A. but if these kids are going to be taking care of us in our old age? We're F@*#ed ! I can see Anne Hathaway taking a more serious aproach to her acting career. Wanting to veer from a Disney steroetype but I think she gets just a little too close to porn. I think the sex scenes were way overdone and too numerous. The general portrayal of life in the streets shows no hope. No future for these kids.
1,Havoc,"I rated this 1 star, only because i wasn't allowed to say 0! In my nearly 25 years of watching videos, this is far and the biggest PIECE OF CRAP ever released. The so called Unrated version is NO different than the almost totally censored R release and is the biggest disappointment any studio has ever given us. I am boycotting all releases by this studio henceforth and if you're considering wasting your money on this garbage, consider this: i pre-ordered mine for alot less than i thought i'd have to pay for it, but returned it without opening it, after viewing it from Netflix (the GREATEST of all-time!)PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR $ ON THIS SO CALLED MOVIE!!!"
1,Havoc? I don't get it.,"This movie is not very good. In fact I didn't even watch the whole thing. I don't see any good qualities of cinema in this one. If you are buying this just to see Anne Hathaway naked, don't even bother. It's not worth it. In fact, contact me and I'll give you my copy! I usually only buy movies that I've aleready seen and enjoy, or ones that I know I will like. Oops, thought wrong this time. I'm embarassed to own this piece of crap."
3,"Never underestimate bore white, rich kids...","I originally rented this film to see the HOT Anne Hathaway naked. I was presently suprised, by this film. It appears to be a dark, brutal tale of white kids that don't realize how good they have it.The movie is suprisingly powerful, if there is one flaw it's the ending is rushed. You get a feeling from Alli's character is more of an oops, I messed up and blames everything she did on being young and stupid. There also seemed to be a subplot with the camera kid, but that was not touched on to much. Other than that I felt the movie was very well done, showing how bad thing can get if you go to far. Sadly this is an often times all to real look at LA teens. This should serve as a message to parents, get active in your kids lives and for god-sake's talk to them and love them. As for white kids that want to be gangsta's, As George Carlin once said...""You're white and you're lame....deal with it."" oh yeah....Anne Hathaway looks so hot naked."
4,Great leading and supporting performances,"Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips are rich white girls that are seeking their own image. Gang activity finds them and their friends on their journey to find their identity. This is a very riveting story about 2 girls who just want to ""fit in"", what they wiill do to fit in, and the consequences that follow. I highly recommend this film. While watching it, it remided me of a film called ""Crash"", it won several oscars a few years ago. I recommend that one as well. Havoc is a great film, makes you rethink who your ""real"" friends are and who they expect you to be."
4,Vader Polish Gods!!!!,"It is really awesome to finally have a death metal dvd in 5.1 dolby digital it has 13 live songs taped in poland in that sound format than about seven live songs bootlegged from some festival crappy sound and picture but its a bonus so its cool than there is also three rare videos ,an interview with frontman Peter in Polish(English subtitled)If you enjoy death metal or the band Vader this is a must!!!!!!!KEEP SUPPORTING DEATH METAL!!!!!!!!"
3,Good ...but not great,"You can tell this was a VHS transfer to DVD. The picture kind of has that fuzz look to it, I don't mean it is horrible, but is definitely not up to DVD standards. You can tell its older, Which stems my complaints: I really wish they would have had more songs from Litany on this DVD. Let me be correct, there is songs from litany on here, but its on the bootleg bonus stuff which has such terrible picture and sound quality you will never watch it! I guess Im a guy that was more familiar with Vader's newer stuff when I bought this, so I was expecting much more, it is more rough / deathier than their newer stuff (they are still death metal, but anyone that hears old and new Vader knows what I mean.) Anyway, 4 stars for their litany album, and only 3 for this."
3,Real men don't worry about it.,"I first read this in 82 and used it as a teaching tool for young Marines. The point of the book is real men don't change their thoughts, opinions or behavior based on those of others. A Marine Gunnery Sergeant at the time, it made perfect sense though I didn't need this book to know that. I recently bought it again as a sort of teaching tool for my youngest son and oldest grandson with the following instructions: Read it, tell me what you think it means. Their answer: Always try to do the right thing and don't worry about what others think. Grade? 100%"
3,"It's supposed to be humor, folks","I read this back in 1982 and considered it harmless satire on macho masculinity. Sure, there are a lot of knuckle draggers who really believe this stuff, but everyone is entitled to their own idiotic opinions. You're certainly not going to change anyone's attitude by telling them they're morons. Honestly, folks who take this seriously ought to remember that ""real men"" are too self-assured to care about other people's benighted definition of ""real men"". Bruce Feirstein had his moment in the sun, and now he's a footnote in feminist backlash. It doesn't matter whether he actually believed this stuff. I would guess he probably wrote the book just to get people riled up. Seems to have worked, too.Overall the book is funny and a good read. Just don't read too much into it."
4,It makes you laugh,It was fun reading this book. Loved the small pocket book idea...I finished in no-time. Simply written with great insight.
1,"Not Funny, Did Not Age Well","I've probably heard the line ""Real Men Don't Eat Quiche"" hundreds of times while growing up, whenever quiche was served, mentioned being served, or even mentioned. As a child of the 80's I was too young to have seen this book the first time around. On a whim I decided to purchase this book, to see what all the ""funny"" was about. Expecting to read some hilarious version of Ron Swanson (from Parks & Recs) spliced with Red Forman (from That'70s Show) with a hint of Mark Rippetoe, I was thoroughly disappointed. Real Men humor hits my funny bone the hardest, and this lacks both creativity a humor. I highly doubt Bruce Feirstein would even know a ""real man"" if he saw one. Save yourself the thirty clams, and watch something with Nick Offerman."
4,I've Never Laughed so Hard!,"I read this thirty years ago, and can remember few times that I've laughed as hard from something that I have read. What I find completely mind boggling is that there are some who seem to be interpreting the book as a serious socio-political commentary of some sort. Gimme a break, folks! This is nothing more than a light- hearted spoof on the two opposing caricatures of masculinity of that era; the so-called ""sensitive male"" stereotype that started to emerge in the late '70's and the macho Lucky Strike chain-smoking buffoon of the 50's and 60's. Just enjoy it for what it is.Sez You! :)"
2,Save Your Money,Certainly not worth the asking price...Most of whats gone over on the DVD is already free on U-Tube...No manual is supplied with the DVD other than what comes with your R24 in the box...Really disappointed with it...The video quality also leaves one disappointed as well....Save your money...
5,ma ei osika eriti hästi inglise keelt,"kuulan paljude rahvaste muusikat, eriti viimasel ajal. eriline lemmik on Jan Garbarek."
4,awesome,looks just like the picture. good quality. the design is really nice. Got this for my brother's new apartment and he really loves them. good for a man's apartment or a modern couple's home.
4,Corelle Corelle Corelle!,Its an overall good set as I am a student living in an apartment! Decent sized plates with mugs. Its a good set that I can use it for the next two years. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy dinnerware.
4,Good Quality,Well Packaged and looks like a quality item. Good value for the money and the pattern is clear and crisp
3,Not dissatisfied,"Very thin dinnerware. Usually, the quality of items with such reviews at amazon exceeds my expectations. Not this item. For $27 though, I am sure you can do worse...but you can probably do better as well."
4,Unbreakable,"I first got this set while in college. 8 years later, they are still fully intact despite being dropped many times. My brother also has a set and even he has not broken a single dish. They're light and as a set provide me with everything I need.If you have a college student who needs dishes, or you are just a klutz like me, buy Corelle dishes. They will survive many beatings!"
4,Corelle quality,"I like the light weight and durability of this product, I would have gave a five star review but the print pattern was defective on two dinner plates"
3,Corelle dishes,"I have owned corelle dishes for so many years that I can't count.I decided to update and get a new pattern. I do believe the new corelle is not as sturdy and my old set, but what I want is dishes that are not to heavy and that's what I got"
5,Nice,"Nice set, got it a day earlier than was expected. This is my first set of corelle dishes, and am so very happy. They were packed in a box that protected the outside of the original box. Very happy with this purchase. The dishes are nice, simple and go with anything. Will most def be buying more soon!"
4,dinnerware,I like my dishes. There are a few small flaws in them but this is a nice set to own.They are very easy to clean the food slides right off.
2,Nice shots of fireworks but is way too short,"The whole is only maybe like less than 30 minutes long that is include the extra as well. All the content is 1080p 2 of the video is 7.1 sound, i had no complain of the transfer, is high bit rate transfer, but is way too shor."
5,Sensational,"Wonderful compilation of work by legendary french icon whose body of work stands head and shoulders way above what we usually lump together under ""french pop"".If Edith Piaf was a little street singer crying her heart out under some lamp on the corner and honey-voiced Dalida trend hopper, Greco was sophisticated muse who inspired poets and other artist to write for her - collaborators listed here read as who's who in some french poetry class.Besides having a deep,sensual and rich (instantly recognisable) voice somehow reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich - but much better singer - Greco hand-picked the best songs from the best authors and they are all like little theatre pieces, irresistible even if you don't understand french.Instantly evoking a picture of Paris's rooftops, Greco music oozes class and sophistication - it's a poetry set in music rather than pop but no matter how you call it this remarkable artist deserves all the reccomendations in the world."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"These were a big disappointment considering Stanton's long history of making cartridges. I bought these to replace my original 680 EL cartridges (the pre-mounted headshells were of particular interest), and after comparing between the new and old, was disappointed at the inability of the Trackmaster's to reproduce sibilants (words with S's, Ch, etc.) accurately. A few records were completely unplayable due to the distortion in the mid-range areas. Since both of the cartridges exhibited the same behaviour, I have to assume it's inherent in the cartridge. I'm back on my old 680's until something else comes along."
4,Liber aleph: the book of wisdom or folly????,"This book has some real character to it. Its topics and generalities are sometimes predictable. although the book was written in an olde english sort of manner, its delivery is stellar. One should expect nothing short of stunning insight, being you provide the patience and correctly aligned will. In the end i found myself uplifted by the random and cohesive nature that crowley presents for the reader. If you have never read any Crowley works this may be a good start. Philosophy and eastern mysticism in 208 chapters of occult wisdom"
4,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"Like the first book in the Bard's Blood series Hamlet II this book should be taken as more of a sequel to the play rather than a retelling of it.At first this book seemed to have more in common with Bradbury than The Bard. Stratford Ohio is a quite College town where the worst thing in the world is the boy you like being madly in love with your best friend. At least that was the worst thing in the world, until strange lights started hovering in the sky and a mysterious carniavel came to town.But before you put this book down in favor Bradbury's timeless classic you should know that it ties back into Shakespeare's play with a satisfiying twist."
5,Terrific actress! You won't go wrong with this collection!,"I couldn't wait to receive this collection. Barbara Stanwyck is such a great actress and this doesn't disappoint. All of the movies are fabulous, but I'd say my favorites are 'East Side, West Side' and ""My Reputation."" As a kid I grew up watching her in the Big Valley, but have always been a fan. The lady can do no wrong and seemed especially wise in the projects she chose to do. All of these movies are a hit, and I hope they release more of her films on DVD."
2,Annie Oakley w/ Barbara Stanwyck,I didn't much care for the movie. This was no reflection on Barabara Stanwyck's acting or the director... they held it together. It was just a poorly written script.
3,Barbara for ever,"Barbara Stanwyck dans tout l'éclat de son talent : élégance, regard droit et brillant comme une pierre précieuse. Que ce soit dans le western, le thriller ou la comédie, elle imposait sa présence, éclipsant parfois ses glorieux partenaires (Cooper ou Gable, bien palt à cté d'elle!) Elle avait l'assurance de la professionnelle, et la fraicheur de la débutante. Son coup d'oeil était infaillible, et son intelligence lui permettait d'tre crédible dans n'importe quelle situation, mme les plus invraisemblables. Aujourd'hui, seule une Meryl Streep pourrait lui tre comparable..."
2,"Pretty, but fails","The colander is a pretty Barbie pink and it's sturdy but after only a few months I'm noticing rust on the underside edges where the enamel is too thin and water is getting into the metal below. It's not major right now but it won't be long until this colander has to be tossed out. For the price, I expected higher quality craftsmanship.UPDATE: This has been an epic fail. It's too corroded now even from light use that I don't even dare give it to Goodwill. It's on it's way to the landfill. Save your cash."
5,Great Service,Vendor delivery was outstanding. Product exactly as described. Highly recommend vendor.
3,Pretty good Keith Whitley record,I think what most people would like to see is RCA release the now out of print for some time album titled L.A to Miami from 1985 it was Whitley's first commercial album and really contained some good songs and they do not sell it anymore just because maybe the guy is dead and they feel they don't have to print it anymore. This cd released most recently is very good it has alot of his most memorable songs on here but majority of these songs are on Dont Close your Eyes and and on the Essential Keith Whitley so Rca tried here it does though contain a song called Quittin Time from L.a to Miami that has not been heard in a while but they could have done better on this album. They also tend to always leave out a great song called Somebody's doin me right it is only found on the Kentucky Bluebird album and that is out of print to.
1,Poor Quality,I purchased this item three months ago thinking I was getting a commercial-grade product. The non-stick coating is already peeling.Save your money - this product is not worth it.
3,For the historian,"This is a pretty book, and would probably make a good gift for a historian of the mechanical arts. BUT for today's audience it is not an easy read - wordy, quaint, and written in the language and syntax of yesteryear. Not for the average 2010 consumer!"
5,these are the best,"Once you use these you'll never go back. I've had a automotive shop 26 years some of these connectors have been in use for 10+ years. Simple use,great flow, no scratching"
4,Beautiful Music,This is a hard-to-find CD which is too bad. The music is lyrical and beautiful. I'm not familiar with Pedro's career or history. His bass sounds are amazing as is his singing. I bought it for his bass solo on How Insensitive but there's so much great music. Some recorded in Spain and most recorded in Argentina.
2,Not a mat,"I was disappointed with this 'mat' as it was nothing but a towel. It was thin, much thinner than any mat I've used. When it arrived, I thought a towel was sent by mistake.If you want plush, look elsewhere."
2,not what I expected,"This book was not as fantastic as I was hoping it would be. For one thing, there are quite a few recipes that do contain sugar in the form of chocolate or chocolate chips. As an individual who cannot consume sugar for health reasons, I was rather disappointed to see that. Also, I thought that the chocolate recipes that used only stevia and unsweetened cocoa tasted terrible. It was almost like the tastes got separated and didn't hit my tongue at the same time. First I would get a really bitter cocoa taste and then a weird stevia aftertaste. The chocolate layer cake was pretty much inedible and ended up getting thrown out. I also made the chocolate peanut butter fudge and had the same experience. I thought that maybe it was just the chocolate recipes, so I made the ricotta pie as well. It was ok, but still had a funny aftertaste and was not terrific. I was using the KAL brand stevia that another reviewer seemed to have good luck with but it just didn't work out for me."
5,Answered most of my questions,"Well worth the money. User friendly. Helped me figure out the measurements for the stevia I use ""Sweetleaf""Great desserts for a diabetic."
1,Disappointed,"The layout of this book is very nice -- easy to read, with the breakdown comparison of the stevia recipes vs. sugar. That is the best part of the book; and perhaps the book tastes better than the recipes. I tried making the chocolate chip cookies and the brownies (twice) and both turned out very egg-y. The texture was more souffle-like and pretty gross; it is not the ""cake like"" consistency the author claims it to be. I even made the brownies a second time-- using less eggs; same result. Needless to say, I was disappointed and will continue my search for good stevia dessert recipes."
1,Not actually low-carb,"I bought this book thinking it was a low-carb stevia cookbook (as the title indicates); however, it uses wheat flour. The only thing that makes it low-carb is that the recipes use stevia instead of sugar. To me, that is not low-carb. It is probably a good cookbook if you only desire to use stevia to replace sugar in your recipes, as there is an art to using stevia. You can't just replace the sugar with stevia; you have to add some bulk, such as apple sauce or some extra liquid, etc. The book has lots of recipes that sound very tasty, but I needed a cookbook that was also wheat-free so this wasn't the book for me."
2,Not for the lactose intolerant..,"I was excited about this book until i started reading the ingredients, everything is made with cream! I'm lactose intolerant & i don't know how to substitute an ingredient like that in a recipe. I will be passing this book along to someone else."
3,This is a different translate version,"This version actually is translated by Rev. Professor J. F. Shaw not by R. P. H. Green is Professor of Humanity (Latin) in the Dept. of Classics, University of Glasgow."
3,Decent Short Story,"I kind of liked it but then I tend to like offbeat, quirky stories.I hated the movie but then I'm not a big Keaneu Reeves fan.If you pay more than $0.99 for this book you'll probably feel cheated."
3,A good enough read,"I enjoyed the writing style, the pot, I did'nt care much for some of the dialogue but my husband didn't have any complaints. He recommended it to me. If he were reviewing it, he'd say it was a solid 4 star short read, I'm more set on 3.5 stars. I don't really have any complaints. Like my title. It was good enough."
3,Good short story turns into cliche-ridden screenplay,"The short story Johnny Mnemonic is one of my favorite short stories, and I was very excited when I heard they were making a movie of it. This was before I knew that good stories don't necessarily turn into good movies. The movie has several problems, including a screen-play that has a few too many genre cliches. Hard-core fans of William Gibson may have enjoyed spotting elements from his previous work, and in my opinion it is these hard-core fans who will enjoy this film the most. This book here has the short story (good) and the screen-play (interesting for Gibson fans and people who enjoyed the film)."
5,They work!,"Gross taste, but these actually do the trick. When I was in my third trimester, I popped Tums like nobody's business. Some book recommended these as an alternative, and I ended up taking them way less frequently than I was taking Tums. Popped three at the first sign of heartburn, and it was gone. If it came back later in the day, another two and I was good.More recently, my husband took three after a night of drinking, and credits them with ""saving his life."" Whatever. They work!"
2,Ok,I had just started taking this supplement that was a different brand and it wasn't bad and I thought i would order more in bulk on line. This one is much more chalky like a tums than my previous one and I tried to keep taking them but have since stopped. Will try to find previous brand that was almost like a little desert after meals. It probably was sweetened or something but the texture and taste would be worth it.
2,Doesn't Work,"This papaya enzyme doesn't work as good as any other brand, even the one I bought from Walmart works better."
3,ok,Tastes good but does not work as well as the other enzymes I used to take-bought these as they were a good deal but will probably not buy again
3,Papaya - okay,This papaya is okay but doesn't seem to have any benefits. It has a sweet taste and doesn't taste bad. I don't see the benefits of taking it.
4,"I think these taste great, chew them after every meal","Believe it or not, a car salesmen told me about these - not this brand, but digestive aids in general. I tried a few and found the taste of these very pleasant. I've not really had issues with indigestion (very rare if I get heartburn). I'm chewing them to make sure I get the most out of the food I eat."
2,"Should state ""Papaya-flavored antacid""","The last ingredient is papaya flavors (see list later). Everything else seems to just make an antacid. Probably works great for that, if that's what you're after. I wasn't. Sure would beat mint or other 'fruity' antacids--so I would highly recommend if you need it. The tablets are very small--I would say 2 or 3 would compare to one small tablet of a competitor. Bright white, with a slight off-putting smell, but they do taste great--just like papaya. I think I'd have to eat dozens to get any papaya benefit though. On the label everything is listed as ""Other Ingredients"" which are: Sucrose, Calcium Carbonate, Vegetable Stearic Acid, Vegetable Magnesium Stearate, Corn Starch, Papaya Flavors. 157mg calcium, 45mg Papain, 6mg Protease, 3mg Papaya Fruit (Carica papaya)."
2,Watch out for the sweeteners,"Tastes OK, but each papaya enzyme product contains different sweeteners. This one contains sucrose, the ""bad"" sugar. My wife feels nauseous right after taking these (sensitive to sweets) so we ditched it and are moving on to another brand. Mannitol, another sweetener used by American Health, is known to cause diarrhea if you are sensitive to it, so be careful which papaya enzyme product you get."
3,Inaccurate site details,"There were supposed to be 600 tablets in each bottle. There were only 250. Although the American Health Original Papaya Enzyme tablets are exactly what I wanted and what we use, it was disappointing to believe we were getting 600 when the bottles only contained 250. With this supplier, be sure to try contacting them before ordering to make sure everything is as you expect."
5,Great!,I'm 7 months pregnant and starting to get lots of indigestion. A friend in a natural mommy group suggested it. It's great safe and natural alternative to other brands on the market.
5,Outstanding,This is a great alternative to antacids. I always carry these with me. They really relief that feeling you get when you over eat.
3,Severely dated,"I remember these books fondly from my childhood in New Mexico. If I remember correctly, Wilfrid McCormick was a friend of my parents.Upon rereading The Three-Two Pitch now, I can see why the series has become so obscure. They're well-written books, with lots of baseball lore that still (mostly) makes sense. But other elements of the book are appalling by modern standards. There's a ""stunt"" involving firearms that is so horrifying to a current reader that it's hard to believe such things were once presented as wholesome fun. And the one can only look on aghast as Cap'n Al, the idealized baseball coach, beats up a rude spectator.I'm glad to have found the book again, and remembered a bit of my childhood, but I can't imagine giving one to a child today."
4,Fun Flight On The PS3,"The game is fun and well worth the money. There were a couple times I became frustrated with the control scheme and the gameplay, but they were minor issues overall."
3,"OK, but","i found the sixaxis rather numb for this game. it is very easy to overcorrect due to lag from controller/game(?. i did improve somewhat with practice but the end result is still not very satisfactory. since i am not one of the dedicated thumbolinas who live to do fine motor movements with their thumbs on consoles, i really had hoped the sixaxis would be implemented well but this is an older game and the sixaxis functionality had to be programmed in recently, i suspect. i am looking forward to Warhawk and B.A.II - which hopefully were written to take full advantage of sixaxis."
4,great game!,"If you have a ps3 and a computer, buy this game for the ps3 instead of the computer. The game (and my plane) crashed on my computer. When I bought the game for my ps3, I was very impressed with the gameplay and the extra missions that only come on the ps3 verison of the game. If you don't have a ps3, one, i don't know why you are looking at this review, and two, don't buy the game for computer. If you want to play the game, play it on xbox360 or ps3, but don't buy the computer verison!"
5,just flying a plane,"So I am not a fan of the 6ax controller but here we have the option of the antalog. Other PS3 games dont give that up. The story is ture and worthy of its record. This game is frustrating as it gets towards the end nevertheless it is by far ""The Best Game I Have Ever Played"" for any system. Worth just turning it on and blowing things out of the sky."
4,Cool WWII Flight Sim,"So I just got this game and while I haven't played much of it, I am thus far very impressed with it. The graphics are astounding, the controls of each plane are unique to them and very realistic as well. The only thing I am having difficulty getting used to is the 6 axis flight method. With practice, I am sure I can become proficient at it too! however, you do have the option to use the control stick to fly with as well. This game is along the lines of the Ace Combat series, but with better graphics. Another issue I have is you have bombing missions and I am having difficulty using the bomb ring, but I am sure I can find the adjuster to tweak that out. As I said, I haven't played alot of it yet, but so far, I am impressed with it thus far."
3,No Gettin' Over You . . .,". . . kicks it! I can't believe nobody's mentioned 'No Gettin' Over You.' This tune is all Bonnie - slide licks that swing and twang and sling, trying to recover from a bad relationship, but just not quite making it (but trying <really> hard). This tune gives me goosebumps every time I hear it - no joking.P.S. Delaney who?"
2,Where is Bonnie Raitt,"Bonnie Raitt is one of the best slide quitarist and Blues singers in the world. Yet, lately (Nick of Time)she sings with no soul and very little guitar. Her early albums will cut you to pieces they are so good. I really would like her to get back to that feel. This new album has two or three that are headed in the right direction but I'm still waiting."
4,SILVER LINING BY BONNIE RAITT,I LOVE THIS CD NOT ONLY IS IT MY FIRST BONNIE RAITT.IT'S SURE NOT TO BE MY LAST. I LOVE HER STYLE.
4,Fun and funky,"I think this ranks with Bonnie's best efforts although not as good as my favorite, ""Luck of the Draw"". It's full of fun and that's the key, with Jon Cleary's bluesy keyboards standing out nicely alongside some tasteful slide guitar from Bonnie. The band and Bonnie at times sound like present-day Little Feat (with Shauna Murphy on vocals). I don't think that's a bad thing at all. It may not be a classic but it's a fun ride."
3,Disappointment,"Let's make it clear: I'm a long-standing, pre-Grammy award fan of Bonnie Raitt's. So, when I heard she'd released a new CD, I snapped it up and expected the kind of soulful, jiving, bluesy music for which she has for so long been famous. After playing _Silver Lining_ over and over, I have to say the one word that describes my reaction is...disappointment. With perhaps one or two exceptions, I found this CD rather lackluster. Bonnie: please. Get back to those blues and soulful ballad roots. Fans: if you don't own it now, get her _Collection_, there's no other CD that has it all like that one."
5,Worth waiting for!,"I, too, am a long-time Bonnie listener and am not at all disappointed with this latest offering. In fact, I think it's her best in a long while! I really like the African-tinged flavor of many of the songs and think the classic blues- sounding ""No Gettin' Over You"" is the best thing she's written in several albums. If only Sippie Wallace were alive to duet on it! Another highlight is the country/blues sound of ""Valley of Pain,"" but all these songs are great. Way to go, Bonnie! Can't wait to hear these live in concert!"
3,Bonnie can do better,"I was so disappointed in this album. I am a true Bonnie fan from years and year gone by. I found this album lacking in quality, composition and overall depth. AS noted from another reviewer,ther is one very good song but it does not make up for the other brash, redundent and lack luster songs."
2,The lining is getting rusty for Bonnie.,"I was VERY disappointed in Bonnie's new album. I was a true Bonnie fan for a few years, and I found Silver Lining to be lacking in quality, back-up singing, lyrics and overall depth.There is only one good song on this album, the others don't do justice nor compensate for the whole album. I'm sorry, Bonnie. Maybe next time."
3,Disappointing,"I expected great things from this CD and I was very dissapointed. I only liked about half of it - mostly the last half. Bonnie has played with some of the Blues greats and this CD is certainly not the Blues. There is one song, Hear Me Lord, that has sort of a Calipso/Caribbean flavor that I really liked, but I have no idea what the flavor of the other songs are supposed to be. I did, however, really like her slow songs - Valley of Pain and Wounded Heart."
2,Tired Songs and Performance,"I'm tired of the same old sounds. Basically nothing has changed since 20 years ago. Let's fast-forward 2 years ahead. ""Silver Lining"" will be unheard of. Let's rewind 10 years ago,...now let's fast-forward 10 years ahead, result: same old sounds, same old lyrics. Not much has changed, not even the hair,same old skunk stripe. the ""do"" has got to go. Ms. humble should envigor new energy in her music and totally revamp her style. This is not a cd for the season. Let's fast-forward 10 years from now. Bonnie who?! What is the genre musically. What is the musical expresion here. I'm turned off."
4,better with a tab,"I love the song that andy james composed with vai-style.it is really tasty, but i want a tab too. i watched the video again and again, and practiced the pattern from time to time. I found some of the licks he taught are not exactly the same as what he played in the song."
2,The Anti-Iliad,"I have read the reviews that compare this work to Homer's Iliad. Don't believe it! Manfredi uses this work to drape a funeral pall over all of the great, surviving Greek Heroes of the Trojan War. It is a tale of despair, woe, and tragedy. I guess one could say that it is a good view into what ""normal"" proto-Bronze Age life was like.If you want to see the grand heroes of Diomedes, Menelaus, and Agamemnon made into mere mortals, read this book. Be warned, though, that this book will leave you feeling worse than if you had just watched ""Legends of the Fall""."
5,Perfect,These strings are great for a 12 string. I started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel. A 12 string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have. They sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string I have used on this guitar. And I think they will last longer. Which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring!
5,"Elixir Strings Acoustic Guitar Strings, 12-String, Light NANOWEB Coating",Bought these strings for my Epiphone 12 string guitar I have had for 30Years and still going strong. These strings gave the guitar a new crisp sound again.I also bought (3) 6 String sets for my other guitars around the house and having fun teaching my 11 year old daughter and 6 year old son to play them.
1,Great if you play an 11 string guitar . . .,"High G string snapped within 30 minutes of playing. Now I have an 11 string guitar. When you break one out of a twelve set of $20.00 strings, you don't end up with $18.32 worth of strings, you end up buying another set. That's what you should do now; leave this page and buy another set!!!"
2,Nice until they break,The high G string broke after about 30 days. This happened during tuning. Too late to return so I`ll probably try another brand
4,Holiness in the midst of evil,"I read this book before and while traveling in Vietnam in the summer of 2009. Having lived through the time about which this book is written, having struggled with the meaning of the US involvement and the decisions made and avoided in that encounter, I was able to develop a more healthy and positive perspective of the men and women who were engaged in this struggle and of their horrific encounters with humanities' evil behavior. I recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about what North Vietnam terms ""The American War of Aggression."""
5,GREAT books!,"All of the ""My First Board Books"" are great, but this is our son's favorite. We've been looking at it since he was just a couple months old, and he loves all the bright colorful pictures. Early on he learned he could turn the pages themselves, which thrilled this Mom. Now that he's 1, he loves to sit and turn the pages and he ""chatters"" at the pictures. It's also great for teething, he can tell you. I'm a little embarrassed to take this book places, because he has really USED it, but it's clearly one of his favorite things to play with."
4,good buy,"I like this book. For primary and other main colours it has several objects of the same colour on each page. I think colours like gold and silver, multi-colour and black and white could have been left out. It is hard for a child/ toddler to learn black and white when the examples have both colours in the object and on the same page. I like it because my daughter will be able to learn the basic colours, which is why I bought it."
3,Does not help,"This book does not help, my daughter could not see and difference while see try to figure out the colors. she always point out the shapes which are described for colors."
5,Great books!,"These books are perfect for young toddlers who are learning new words. My son (21 months) LOVES these books and knows SO many objects that I wouldn't have thought to teach him. It isn't a story book, just many different pictures and the words describing them. Great books and I would recommend to anyone with a child learning to talk!"
4,"Great story, but where are the pictures?","This is a wonderful story written as letters from a grateful young woman to her benefactor who sends her to college. However, certain letters refer to drawings that simply aren't there! Too bad, I loved the pictures in ""Dear Enemy"", the companion novel. I would also have preferred a smaller format for this book."
2,Not a classic,"Great premise for a story, a mostly likable main character, but disappointingly trapped in time by the author's social and political views. It certainly does show how a young person is easily influenced by false voices of culture and world as they step away from the community in which they have been nurtured. I'd recommend reading it for the plot, just ignore the fabianism/socialism of the author's tone and influence."
4,Nice book not complete,"The book is very nice. I would have loved to see the drawings that are mentioned in the letters, it is just part of the hole.I recommend this book strongly. It is fresh, deep, and full of hope."
4,"An easy, enjoyable book",Not my usual choice of book but I really enjoyed the read. It is easy reading but nevertheless well written. I think buying this kindle will widen my horizons. Nothing wrong with trying lighter reads than usual.
5,Excellent book,"This is one of those books I read when I was a teenager and have read over and over again since. A fun, short read and one that gives insight into women's lives both in the past and today. One of the better books I have read that use the format of letter-writing to narrate a story too."
3,The mistake,"I must admit that the service was excellent. The shipment arrived early. The object, Daddy Longlegs, was in excellent condition. There was one little problem which was probably my own fault. I thought I was ordering a dvd of Daddy Longlegs and ended up with a book. I guess I should pay attention."
5,Very sweet.,"This was a favourite of mine when I was a child. I can't remember how many times I have read it, my original copy was battered and dog eared but it was always a pleasure to settle down and enter Judy's world. I am so delighted to have found this for Kindle and for free!"
5,A Timeless Classic...,"I can honestly say this is timeless. I grew up reading my mother's copy of this book, and I had read it several times before I noticed the copyright date. It was written nearly 90 years ago, but I never knew it. I think the thing that captured my attention was the fact that it's written in diary style. I felt like I *knew* Judy Abbott. She's a wonderful character, and you can't help but wonder what's going to happen next. And the ending...well, it'll just blow you away!"
4,"A cute, quick, breezy read","I believe this book falls under ""young adult lit"" but it is enjoyable for adults as well. This book is sweet, funny and quite a little page turner. I can't imagine not falling in love with Jerusha Abbot and her letters!"
2,I don't really like this book....,"For me, I don't really like this book although many people love to read. I won't read this book if the school doesn't force me to do so. I think this book is very boring because it is 'made' of many letters that Judy wrote to Daddy Long-Legs. I hate to read letters so I don't like this book. But the grammer of this book is really good, so you can still take a look of it."
5,a wonderful children's classic that stands the test of time,"This book is one of the dearest to my heart. I must have read it 50 times. Jean Webster delicately molded this novel to tell the tale of a girl coming-of-age through letters to her mysterious gaurdian. The ending surprises me every time. People young and old will genuinly treasure this story of a poor ophan growing into a learned, beautiful woman."
5,A Reader from Maine,"I learned so much while reading Daddy-Long-Legs! One of the most satisfying aspects of the book was learning intimately and in depth about who Jerusha Abbott really was. After I finished the book, I had a feeling as if I knew a completely amazing woman. Some of the things that Jerusha says in her letters to Daddy-Long-Legs was inspiring and uplifting. I enjoyed the book immensely. It was a true page-turner for me. The ending alone is enough to want to read the book. I encourage it to everyone who likes a book written in the form of letters."
3,These letters aren't all that good?,"A movie I remember from when I was young isDaddy Long Legs.An orphanage raised girl turns out to be very smart at schooland in creative writing, but just really can't read people at all well.About the second Julia's uncle Jervis showed up I figured he must besomeone connected to the Trustees of the orphanage.Yet is takes her another four years to make any connection?As romances go this is a strange one where an adult benefactor waitsfor a girl to grow up.Too many times adults have preyed on young girls alone in the worldas Judy /Jerusha is.I don't think it is a good theme for young girls to take in."
4,A Great Book to Read during the Summer,"Daddy Long Legs is a story about an orphan girl who is sent to college by an anonymous benefactor. Most of the book is the smart, witty, charming letters she writes to him. Even if this book was originally written in 1912 (and is therefore based in such a time period), it is a great summer read if you are feeling like you might need to be excited about school before you go back to it. Jerusha Abbott is very funny and sweet, and readers will love her. Also, her writing is very descriptive, so it's easy to get a picture of her life. I make it a tradition to read this before I go back to school. I hope you read it and like it as much as I do!"
5,Perfect for ages 10-100!,"Jean Webster's children's classic Daddy-Long-Legs is a MUST-READ. It's marketed toward youth but I'm 36 years old and loving it! The writing is witty and knowing, and Jerusha is the girl-pal you always wished you'd had. Adults will apreciate the sophisticated, dry humor and young people will love the breezy style and language. Don't be put off by the book's age (turn of the century): it is as fresh and relevent today as one hundred years ago!"
5,Cate Tiernan takes her tales of witchcraft to an adult level,I liked this book. I just finished it last week and I have started on the second one. I have read some of the books in the Sweep series and totally feel in love with Cate's style of writing. This series is more adult where as Sweep was more teen and tween. Most of it's due to the fact the twins in the series are approaching adulthood(they are 17). It's nothing like T*Witches if anyone was wondering when they read the summary for this series. Though I love T*Witches as well this series has a totally different spin on it's twin characters. I can't wait till the other two books come out because so far the series is awesome.
5,Bizarre,"Good, excellent, magnificent, bravo. A very good read!!! I enjoyed it immensely. I would refer this book to anyone that likes supernatural reads!!!!!"
5,AWESOME story,I love this story. The characters are so fun and the New Orleans setting makes me want to go to New Orleans... I'm excited to read the next book!
2,Peeling off,"I bought these to iron on the inside of the knees of all my kids jeans to try to prevent the holes that inevitably appear. Unfortunately they are all peeling off after one wear/wash. As another reviewer speculated, maybe they aren't designed to work in high friction areas, or areas of clothing which endure a lot of stretching, but isn't that where you'd naturally need a patch?"
1,These don't work,"My 3 and a half year old plays hard and puts holes in all of his jeans. I would go broke buying him new ones so I was looking for an easy solution to patch his pants. The directions were easy to follow and they ironed on with no problem. Unfortunately, these came off of every pair of pants after I washed them. As much as I wanted these to be an easy solution, they just didn't work."
3,Doesn't stay on very well,"These want to come off when you launder the item. The iron was able to re stick them about twice, after that there is insufficient adhesive. Good short term solution but you will need to sew a patch for a permanent solution"
2,Iron on easy but now it looks like I am wearing knee pads!,Easy to use and they do the job but now everytime I wear those jeans the patch is clearly outlined because it is stiffer fabric than the jeans. I can't wear those jeans anymore because they look silly.
1,don't waste your money,"The second you put your item in the dryer, the glue will not hold your patch any longer. I guess if you are going to line dry your denim or you never wash the item give it a go."
5,Contents,"Design & The Handweaverby Mary Meigs Atwatershuttle craft guildmonograph 31961""Elements of Design such as purpose, proportion, texture, color and pattern are covered in the author's unique style as she stands back from the details of weaving and discusses the components that lead to the production of a good design. This monograph offers insight into the design process gained through the author's 40 years of involvement in handweaving."""
5,Best war book yet!,The descriptions were so accurate that you certainly felt like you were there.This author is one of the best.
2,Thin Red Line,Story was very scattered. I had seen the movie and thought it was not very good and after reading the book understand why it was not good!
4,The Thin Red Line,"This book gives an insight into the mind of a soldier during the Second World War. It explores how most of us would probably react to being thrown into not only a completely alien landscape, but into one of the most brutal battles of the war, with little to no experience. While not necessairally an 'easy' read, the story flowed nicely between flashbacks and the 'present'. I would reccommend this book to anybody who is interested in history/warfare. I certainly took alot away from it."
4,WW II in the Pacific,This is a must read for WW II readers. Delivered as promised in good condition.
5,War in Men,"This book is not about men at war as much as it is about war in men. It is about war alright...a war with fear for some, with jealosy for another, a war with death for another, war with faith for yet another. Every one of those C-for-Charli company has a war...not only with the unseen Japs and their deadly hidden machine guns...but also with themselves. In order to win the war with the outside enemy, they have to win a war with the inside enemy, the humanity in them, and they must lose the war against the animal in them... The story has its share of tactics and warfare...but its main concern is with the men at this war...and the war in these men. A truey wondrful read..."
3,I can see why people like it but...,"This was an interesting book. I actually picked it for a school project. Although I am an avid reader, I found myself slowly getting through the book, without much enthusiasm. The battle scences were some of the best I had read, not to mention the most realistic, the movie was also great in showing these scenes. The main problem for me occured with the characters. There were to many and with the confusion of battle it was hard to follow each cahracter. This novel actually disgusted me in terms of the brutality of war. The movie was something different all together. The gruesome scences, horrific images, and homosexuality were mostly igonored in order to give a more profound message. The movie also suffered from lack of cahracer developpment. This book was good, not great for me. I have read other war novels and this personally downgrades the Americains(as if nothing else has done that before)."
4,Excellent,"A superb look into the psyche of the fighting man in the Battle for control of the Pacific Islands. Fast moving, page turning adventure."
4,A classic that is still worth reading,"I think reviews are most effective if you compare the book in question to others that most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. The Thin Red Line could be best described as a war novel of action, suspense, and revealing characterizations of combat soldiers--with the relentless pace and stunning power of war genre gems like The Triumph and the Glory and The Killer Angels, with an authoritative style that reflects the author's own experience in WWII."
3,An interesting book,"It has been interesting but I found it long. James Jones follows the psychological waves of a dozen men in the battles of Guadalcanal. It has been shocking to find so much hate and competitivity, and so little friendship and comradery."
4,An excellent war novel,"This is James Jones’ semi-autobiographical account of the battle for Guadalcanal. The book follows the officers and men of Charlie Company from their 1st landing on the beaches of Guadalcanal through the 2 months of the campaign to take the island from the Japanese. Jones is especially good at characterizations and is able to get inside the heads of his large cast of characters from West Point graduates to uneducated draftees. The book is brutal and, while the men are often heroic, there’s not a John Wayne among them."
4,The Thin Red Line: A Novel,"I thought it was an interesting book although i am not a big fan of fiction, especially about history in general and war in particular; one would need to know a certain amount of historicaly accurate information about the Battle for Guadalcanal Island to really understand this book.......i thought the movie was better than the book,however......"
1,Couldn't finish reading it.,"Honestly, the homosexual overtones and the constant depiction of dysfunction in practically every one of the characters made this book too difficult to enjoy. I wound up throwing it in the trash because I didn't want to subject anyone else to it by donating it to the thrift store."
1,Ugh!,"I had high hopes for this book but it turned out to be one of the worst books that I have ever read. It was tortuously slow, tedious and pretentious. I did not care about the characters. The author was consumed with providing trivial meaningless details and the battle scenes while at times compelling were inconsistent. Some were too long and some were too short. I found myself skipping entire sections of the book to try to get to interesting points. All in all--a disaster"
4,"The book was excellent, Joe Mantegna shoulda stayed home..","The authors ability to express the personal feelings of men trapped in a time and place that they don't want to be in is commendable and seems to take the reader directly to the war as it occurs. Mantegna's reading was less than acceptable, I almost turned off the machine during the first tape. Someone should tell him that C as in Charlie is acceptable military language and known by all. He didn't have to repeat it over and over again throughout the reading. He sounds like a person who didn't have any military background, if he didn't have any military, he shouldn't have made it so obvious. A little pre-reading research would have gone a long way. Theres an old USMC saying, the 6 ""p's"", "" Prior planning prevents P_ _ poor performance"" GP Allen"
4,The grim butchery of warfare in WII Guadalcanal,"James Jones was one hell of a writer. His book The Thin Red Line demonstrates a mastery of the craft by telling essentially the same story through the eyes, hands, wounds and deaths of many different men as World War Two raged in the South Pacific. In the middle of fierce fire fights, his characters reflect, almost emotionally detached from the merciless deaths they encounter on the grim butchery of warcraft:""This was war? There was no superior test of strength here, no superb swordsmanship, no bellowing Viking heroism, no expert marksmanship. This was only numbers. He was being killed for numbers.""Although the poetry of the film adaptation is not as present in the novel the passages, like the one above, reverberate like shells exploding.This brutal and graphic account, based on Jones own experiences as an Army Sergeant in combat at Guadalcanal, is easily one of the best books about war and the senselessness that overcomes the men who wage that war."
5,"An engrossing, page turning novel of sheer brilliance","The Thin Red Line made me feel as a reader in a way I have never felt before. These people are so realistic, from their sexual desires and loneliness, to their heroism in the face of battle. James Jones has written this novel in a way that makes you feel like you are in the battle, a part of the action. One easily has a favorite character, and the raucous actions of the soldiers truly makes it hard for me to believe that this book takes place in the '40s! Pre-teens and teenagers usually get the notion that the people in the 1940s were proper, well-mannered, 'seen and not be heard' types. In fact, the soldiers in The Thin Red Line talk about and do things that most people would not think of doing today. This is not only on Guadalcanal only, they do these things in the good U. S. of A. The book brought so much information to me. If only Jones had written a sequel."
5,extremely well-written,"I have written two research papers on Richard Neutra and therefore have read lots and lots of books about the architect and his evocative buildings. This book, while admittedly just a quick look at Neutra's major works, is well-written (even lyric at times), packed with information, and interesting. She discusses his background and influences, theories of biorealism and technology, and characteristic stylistic language. The quality of the photographs is excellent--they are crisp and clear and literally pop out of the page, alive with contrast and color. I bought this book on a whim thinking that it would be just ""fun"" compared to longer, more involved texts, but it has become my favorite!!"
2,evaluation,"basic book not so many good shots , others books about Palm Spring garden & architecture got much better pics ."
2,Not very substantial,"Overall this is a good book about Neutra, but it is pretty light. It's very short and most of the pictures are old. Compared to other books on specific architects (especially those by phaidon) this is severely lacking in content. If you're just looking for a quick overview of some of Neutra's more famous work than this book is for you."
5,Annie Enneking=genius,"Annie Enneking is the best actor in the world. She should have won the oscar for this movie. Also, Jerry Drake is a genius."
5,Excellent overview of a master,"Like most of the RCA series, this, too is an excellent overview of a master of country music. If you are new to Porter, you need to get familiar with him and this is the place to start. If not, it is still an excellent listen for the car that flows very nicely for a compilation."
2,Small Ac Generator Service Manual,"for my particular generator, i DID NOT learn anything that i hadn't read in the owners manual about troubleshooting the generator portion. it's still not generating power. most of the book is on the engines of these generators. i know how to fix engines."
3,generator book,"I thought it would have more information on motors , trouble shooting on the motor as well as the generator. there is no good way of removing rotor off of the crankshaft. Not a lot of onfo on generator models."
3,I am not sure,Even though some of the questions raised are very reasonable and thought provocating the book fails to provide factual documentantation and back up logic
2,Half a book,"The first half is this book raises interesting questions about the Justice Department and how it may have comprimised national security to insurance organized crime prosecutions. The second part of the book talking about the 9-11 commission falls apart. The 9-11 discussion is rambling and raises questions that, when asked without context may be valid, but in the context of a continuing war on terror and a presidential election won't be asnwered. By using sources like Salon.com, Henry Waxman, and Richard Clarke I could tell you the conclusion before I read the chapter; the plea for unbiased accounting of the events of 9-11 can not be found with these sources."
3,Good information reagarding the 9/11 commission,"I really like Peter Lance. I enjoy his writing style and he has researched his topics well. However, I thought 1000 Years for Revenge was better. He seemed a little stressed and frustrated while writing this book. However, I would still recommend Cover Up. Without this book and 1000 Years for Revenge I would have been clueless as to the flaws of the 9/11 Commission."
5,we reach for the moon every night,my 2 boys love this book. they pick it out every night. can't wait for the sequel!!
3,It's ok,"The pictures are great, but the story line is just so, so. If it weren't for the pictures, I'm not sure that my kids would even listen to the story."
5,Sheer joy,"My 19 month old daughter revels in this book. She knows exactly where it is kept, and insists on having it read to her at least a half dozen times a day. The pictures are lovely, full of little surprises that you catch each time you read it."
5,"Librarian's Favorite, my two-year-old son's favorite too!","BEAUTIFUL PROSE, WONDERFUL PICTURES. My two-year-old son LOVES this book. The assonance (vowel rhyme within the words) in the prose makes it flow much like a poem but much more sophisticated than the popular, ""Good Night Moon."" The first line: ""I took the moon for a walk last night, it followed along like a still summer kite, high in the sky through darkness and light, when I took the moon for a walk."" Animals and people appear from page to page with wonderful landscapes that reward readers when closely examined. I am a librarian and this book should be on a list of BEST CHILDREN'S BOOKS, EVER."
3,Not worth it.,"As a beginner Wiccan, I stumbled upon this book at B&N;, and decided to buy it for the heck of it, just to add to the collection. Then I finally decided to read through it and seriously ""End World Hunger""... et cetera. A little outrageous, I might say? Of course anyone in their right mind would know that some lines of text won't feed a few thousand kids suddenly, or end all wars and conflicts in the world and make the greatest of enemies bed-buddies.Though the prayer for a deceased pet was interesting. I'll give it that much credit, but that's just me being so in-touch with animals.Seriously, if you're serious about help in Wiccan prayer, don't get this book. You're much better off using your own mind to create your own."
1,Do Not Buy This Book!,This book was Christian prayers with God and Jesus replaced with the word Goddess. This book is despicable!
2,May be useful for beginners or kids,"First of all, in case you skimmed over the ""Dimensions"" statistic above, this is a tiny book. It's about the size of a woman's hand, and half of its thickness is its cover. I suppose the consumer is paying extra for the pretty cover; it's too small a book to cost this much.Second, this is a book that you yourself could write in just a few days. Unless you're a small child or have been a lifelong atheist, I'm sure you know how to pray. Just start talking! Seriously. Your words are as valid--and probably more meaningful to you--than what is to be found here."
1,Total idiocy,"This book is not what it purports to be. It is not at all an appropriate representation of Wicca or Wiccans. For one small example, it states without hesitation that all Wiccans are vegetarian. ?!?!!! I know Wiccans who are some of the biggest meat-eaters around. The more religious aspects of Wiccan culture are just as badly represented. This author is obviously A) misinformed and B) an idiot. Enough said."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book because I thought that it might have some great Wiccan daily meditations. What I found was a very short little book that had more prayers, prayers that anyone could write or old ones that have been used by Christians and just edited a bit to suit Wiccans. Not the best book I have read."
5,Beware of false imitations,"Some reader from VA is angry at Mark. But this reader failed to place her (or his) name. Can the person even read? Beware of Beware of false imitations! Jealousy is a bad thing, and this bigoted hate lashed out at Mark is sickening! These people claim Mark knows nothing, but it is they whom are ignorant. They sacrifice animals to their so-called gods, and others sodomise themselves! Such practices are not wiccan. This book is your shield against such evil. It is well written, edited, and thought out!"
5,Beautiful prayers!,"The simplicity of this new Wiccan book is truly beautiful. The many prayers here are like spiritual poems sang from the heart of eternal love. There is no dogma or unnessasary instructions, just pure devotional prayers. And there is a chapter on crafting your own prayers too! Some people may think this prayerbook is too simple, but in reality, simple things work best in this over analytical and stress filled world. I give this book a 5 stars only because the PC wouldn't let me give it 10!"
5,Pleasant and very spiritual.,"A very pleasant book. The prayers seem to come from a very spiritual and emotional man. I agree with the other reviewers here: This book was very much needed, and it is nice to see it is finally here."
1,Questionable,"Mr. Ventimiglia started Catholic, spent a few years dabbling in other religions and when people in those other religions disagreed with him he returned to Catholicism. Read his own opinions on his personal web page at:http://www.geocities.com/mark71565/For a book on Wicca I would look for something written by someone serious about it and not some charismatic dabbler who was taking a few years off from Catholicism. For a Prayer Book, pick up Ceisiwr Serith's while it's still in print."
1,"What religion is this, again???","Rev. Ventimiglia seems to be confusing Wicca with Christianity. He seems to have no concept of the kind of relationship we, as Wiccans, have with our Gods, nor of who They are.Of course, his credentials through the Universal Life Church are easily purchased by anyone and are no proof of any training, and it is readily apparent that, if he has any Wiccan training at all, it is shoddy.He has been shunned by Seax-Wicca, the one organization that did have formal ties to him. They no longer acknowledge him.This is not someone we should look to for our devotions or service to our Gods. He doesn't have a clue."
1,"Uninspired at the very least, misguided at best,","With great anticipation I picked up this book, only to be sorely disappointed.This author's stance as a spiritualist (i.e. Reverend Mark) is as phony as it comes. Universal Life Church ordination? Who doesn't have one of those? My cat has one...His prose is without grace, inspiration or a true appreciation for Wicca or the Gods. Not only has this man been a disgrace to Seax Wicca (whom has now denounced him), he is a disgrace to Wicca as he espouses hatred, discrimination and intolerance towards homosexuals and those he sees as being 'corrupt'.A more disgraceful faux-Wiccan author I've yet to read....and I've read a lot of these.Save your money, buy a Wiccan text that teaches the Path of love and acceptance."
2,"Good Ideas, Bad Writing","Reading through the table of contents shows a wide variety of prayers on topics from Prayer to the Dawn to Prayer to Save the Rain Forests. Unfortunately, the prayers themselves are dry and contrite. They state the spirtual need in a matter of fact, textbook way. No sense of artistic flow. For the Star Trek fans out there a good example of a poem Data might write."
5,Beautiful Prayers,This work of prayers is beautifully done! Poetic and lovely! A prayer for every occasion! Thanks Mark!
3,Great Starter GPS(2 years ago),"My review of this is compared to the new Etrex Legend HCX. This is great for starters for hiking,mtn biking, or geocaching. It is pretty accurate but slower at being precise with directions. In other words it has a slower aquisition of satellites. Also signal is spotty under heavy cover. It is now cheaper to buy the new Etrex Legend HCX than this item and the new one is exactly the same except with quicker satellite aquisition and more accuracy. Have fun"
2,Fancy Compass - Expensive GPS,"This unit is useless without buying Garmin maps. This is true for many of their products.So if you add the price of City Navigation CD and Topo CD, you have over $500 bucks invested.Instead of giving you maps, they give you games. The map interface is not particularly intuitive. And within 10 minutes I found a glich in the ""find exit"" part of the program.The way this product ships - you could do as well with a compass, paper and natural markers."
1,Customer Service,"Merchandise recieved in timely manor, Defective unit. Got return authorization from Myron Global. Returned merchandise - have never heard from them again. Made several attempts to contact directly and thru Ama Zon with no results. $200 loss on my part."
1,Naive,"I guess the picture of the unit with streets in the the imagemade me suppose that is what you get. Apparently you do not. All you get is the main roads so once you zoom into your neighborhood you get a blank screen. To buy the street maps from Garmin cost $140 just for N. America. Looks like I should have just stuck with my laptop and Google maps. The Garmin web site is poor. I tried updating my software. Although I hit the update software it baulked because there were already files of the same name. Even after clicking ""ok"" the update box to extract the files never disappeared or changed to say it had correctly updated. I was left wondering if it had."
1,"""It's the FRENCH manual, stupid.""","The Garmin Legend Cx arrived quickly, and was well packed. Boy was I disappointed to find out that this unit comes with a manual written in FRENCH. Writting on the box and the outside of the manual are in English, but the inside of the manual is written completely in FRENCH. A call to Garmin got me NO HELP, they told me I can go to their website to download and print out the 100 page manual. Do you think that will go in my car's glove box? So far this is not a good example of 1) Quality Control and 2) Customer support.I received a nice email from Amazon, but they do not carry replacement manuals. They SHOULD however let you know BEFORE you order, that you will not be receiving an English Manual."
4,Really like it.,"This is my first GPS device. I like it and use it everytime I go anywhere new. I like the ergonomics and ease of use, nothing really complicated, you can basically fire it up and start using it without even reading the directions. Keep in mind you will want more memory and Map software to go with it."
4,"Nice unit, stable signal and trip computer","I've owned this and the newer model HCX. The HCX locks on to satellites very quickly and hold the signal indoors or in built up areas. Very good for hiking and the like. I mainly use the trip computer functions and the CX is much more consistent and stable for trip data out in the open. Apart from the chips the units are identical. Buy the less sensitive but cheaper CX for canoeing, biking etc. Get the HCX for built up areas and when you don't need an accurate speedo"
4,Check Model Accessories!,"Do NOT trust the accessories that Amazon offers after putting your GPS in your cart. I chose my GPS and several accessories from the ones that Amazon recommended with out looking into it fully. I guess I assumed that Amazon would offer accessories that fit the product I just put in my cart, but they were the wrong ones. Luckily I know alot of people who own GPS's and they became perfect Christmas gifts.I am also having trouble figuring everything out on my Legend but I think that is due to my stubborn inability to pick up and follow the manual. Its pretty nice besides that stuff. I wish it came with better maps installed but what ever."
4,no complains so far,"Brought this about a year ago and have been very satisfied with it.Pros:* Solid construction.* Good battery life.* Very readable screen (I was pleasantly surprised).* The controls are slightly tedious, but works for a handheld. Even single hand operation is fine.* I found the cursor controls more suited for left-handed ppl. I am a lefty so I am happy :-). Or maybe I am just used to it now.* Expandable memory.* Tracks are quite accurate. This is included in the base software.Cons* The satellite reception is spotty under tree cover. But seems better that garmin iQue.* City software costs extra. I got it a license from my friend for CitySelect NA. (Each software has 2 licenses, for 2 devices).* The software has some short-comings.** Like you can find a place near a remote location. E.g. if I am in San Francisco, I cant find a pizza place in San Jose. It will only give me pizza place in I think 50m radius of San fran."
3,"Not Exactly a ""Rocking Chair""","This chair is comfortable and beautiful. It looks very elegant in my daughter's nursery but if you are looking for a chair that rocks, this is not the chair for you. I thought maybe it was because it was on carpet, rather than hardwood so we bought a plastic mat to put under it, hoping that would fix the problem but it didn't do the trick. I like the chair, but disappointed that I can't rock my child to sleep in it (which is why I bought it in the first place)."
1,Does Not Rock!,"This chair is very cute, but it does not rock (and the little that it does, you have to really exert yourself - even on a hard floor). The back sits well below the shoulders so there is no head support. It sits low to the ground as well. I am short, so sitting in it was fine for me, but my husband who is 6 feet tall had a harder time getting in and out. I bought it for the Children's nursery, so it did not fulfill what I needed in any way. If you like the look of it and just want to sit, it will work. But if you want the rock or head support, this is not the chair to get."
3,Johnson's novelized life story gives insight to the outsider,"In her first book, Johnson ""novelizes"" the story of her own family from before World War II through the 1960s. Her use of words from other languages can be tedious, but also informative. This fairly quick read is worth while not so much for its literary skill as for its relevance to current events in the former Yugoslavia. Through the saga of Johnson's family in times of war and (relative) peace, one gains at least a little insight into the ethnic divisions of the Balkans. Her plot development is thin and her characters, while obviously precious to her, are sometimes hard to know. A good attempt at a first novel, but, again, worth while more for the cultural information than for its literary entertainment."
2,Might Be All the Rat You Need!,"This is a Marshall stack in a road-proof steel box. All PCD sounds (Clean, Dirty, Turbo, and Vintage) are excellent. Cascaded sounds are incredible: the only limit is your imagination. Note: Stand alone PCR boxes' sounds do sound better then their PCD counterparts. PCD ""Channel A"" is left, ""Channel B"" is right: s/b vica versa. You'll need 1 foot (right angle) 1/4"" cables to run your PCD in a pedal chain. Doesn't come with +9V adapter."
3,Bought this book for a class,ALthough I have no problem with the book I hate that author continously put out new material and charge so much and students are forced to buy a book that they most likely won't read until the test and than sell it for $5 because a new edition came out. Sucks but I guess that is how they make their money.
4,Very informative,Gained new insights into the science of psychology. Well written and easy to understand as an introduction to psychology. Information was up-to-date.
3,"strange, haunting story for fans of Maine and mermaids","This slim novel centers around a protagonist who thinks she's a mermaid. Living in a small coastal town in Maine, this book sets up the idea that the girl is either crazy or a mermaid. To enjoy this book you have to accept the author's premise and poetic license that leaves the truth purposely vague.The author's voice is at times haunting, but at other times, her odd narrative style comes across as forced. This is a quick read, and Hunt's language is beautiful, strange, and provocative. I rated this novel 3 stars mostly for technical reasons. The plot and characterization are somewhat weak (or left purposely vague?) but the language and concept are interesting."
4,Born again Classics,"What a great album! I was dubious when hearing this was a reworked ""greatest hits CD"" perhaps expecting the usual tired reworkings to cash-in. But this CD is a collection of Caravan's classics that have been virtually rewritten - and for an acoustic set. Best of all it really works, featuring tracks from their first (and best) four albums - some tracks even an improvement on the originals!Enjoy!"
4,Some good ideas for security.,"I liked the design of the book, it comes in a 3 ring binder, and has a nice graphic design. I contains interesting ideas and suggestions to make your house, car and life safer specially in big and crowded cities. Easy read, and you can learn some new ways to take care of yourself and family."
2,Disappointment - O-Rama,"Yes, i am a foo fighters fan, rating ""nothing left to lose"" as one of my favourite albums ever, but this album was an amazing flop to my ears, on the heavier CD, there are just no ""tunes"", ""best of you"" is a poor and formulaic four chord piece of weener rock and the other songs, average in their riffdom and choruses, fail to leave landmarks such as ""hero"" ""learn to fly"" or ""everlong"" did.things improve with disc 2, some pleasant chords but to be honest when we have amazing stuff like tweaker and bjork these days, these vaguely pretty songs fail to mark aswellgo back to the drawing board foo fighters, fame has gone to your heads, give us another ""godzilla"" before you quit mr grohl, go on, please do."
1,decption,"I like Foo Fighters, but i detest this cd. 2 cds of... i don't know what it is exaclty, but it's not good."
1,Can't bring myself to buy it,"I would love to buy this CD; I've purchased every other FF disc and from what I've heard, Grohl and Co. are even better this time around. But no matter how good the music may be, I can't bring myself to buy a copy-protected disc. Sure, maybe there are some boneheads out there who will make free copies for all their pals without copy-protection. But I listen to most of my music in the car, or at work on my iTunes. I don't want people swiping CDs from my desk and I don't want the discs warping in the summer heat in the glove box, so I burn copies of CDs -- which I have PURCHASED -- so that I can enjoy them and still protect the original media in a nice cool library cabinet at home.Other record companies are taking the trouble to devise a copy protection technology that works with iTunes. Until RCA does the same, I won't be buying any music from them.Sorry, Foo Fighters. Maybe I'll catch the tour."
1,Foo Fighters can't fight off my boredom,"I havent listened to this album for my love of the Foo died out really back in 2000 when Nothing Left... came out. The first two Foo albums are amazing and while I repspect the talent and mystique of Dave Grohl they just dont do anyhting for me anymore. All mY Life is a good song but the rest of One by One is boring. Times like These was cheesy. bleh.I see a lot of negative reviews, so I dont think I'll even waste my time just to be disappointed. The first single Best of You sucks and the second DOA is actually pretty good.Do yourself a favor and get Foo Fighters and The Colour and The Shape. They are two of the better albums of the 90s"
3,Only the first CD is good,"The second CD (the acoustic one) is pretty bad. Its way to slow. That being said, the first CD is good and makes this worth buying; the second CD only raises the cost by a couple of dollars which is why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4.The first CD is the typical Foo Fighters music. I don't like it as much as their self-titled album or ""The Shape & Colour"" but it is still good. I would say that I like it as much as ""There is Nothing Left to Lose"" and ""One by One."" If you didn't like either of those, you're not likely to like this."
4,cd's are for listening to quit b**ching about the protection,"Yes I agree the protection for this cd is alittle overbord, but cd's are to be listened to; You don't need a fu*king pc for that quit b**tching. As for the music I personaly like the second disc better. Its more original, and distinctive. The first disc is good but gets boring. If you like the foo fighters buy it its worth it."
4,A new fan,"Never owned any previous albums by the Foo Fighters but the single ""Best of you"" got me interested. I bought the CD and listened to it continuously whilst on holiday. I'm not a big fan of loud rock but I love it and will now be checking out some of the older stuff. ""In your Honour"" is another belting track to have turned up loud. No so keen on disc 2 I guess the Foo Fighters are better the louder they are!!"
2,"So, so...","I was given this album as a gift. Therefore I can be objective about the quality of the music and not have to defend my making a bad purchase. I flipped thru the first cd (the ""Loud"") and could not find any one song that stood out as being worthy of ""a hit"". The second cd (the ""soft"" one) had maybe 2 1/2 tracks on it that might be worthy of a hit, and/or airtime. Maybe if you're a fan and hung-up on this band you'll buy it for your collection. Otherwise, this 2-set cd is going to fade away (and gather dust) rather quickly..."
3,"""In Your Honor"".... a slap in the face","Yeah it all I have to say. This cd was excellent BUT.... do NOT buy the cd version if you want to put the album on your I-Pod or any other mp3 device. Because of the cd's anti-copy protection, you can't even play it on the computer. I suggest buying it on I-Tunes or Napster in order to be satisfied. Now I can only listen to this cd in the car!"
2,Letdown...,"After the turgid 'One By One' Dave Grohl and co. return with another hugely overhyped collection of over-produced, over-wrought songs. These songs simply don't come to life. Dave Grohl appears to have lost his knack for a great song; theres nothing here that comes close to 'Everlong' or 'I'll Stick Around'. What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is dull, safe, pop-rock lacking any spark whatsoever. Check out the first Foo Fighters album instead if you haven't already."
5,Deep feelings come hearing that album,In Your Honor album is a great experience for me 'cause it brings me back good feelings. It's like listening to a soundtrack of my life. When I listened to the first time I could realize somethings in my life. That songs brings live again. I must thank Dave 'cause I found myself with him music.
2,Did Dave empty the vault on this one?,"I have listened to this album 3 times now, and with the exception of ""What If I Do"", I can't find a song which rates in the top 20 Foo songs ever. Disk One: Dave Screaming a lotDisk Two: Dave not screaming a lot. Since ""You're not the one"", I haven't recalled a truly good Foo track."
4,I really like the songs but...,"I really like the songs in this album but it is so protected like a fortress that I can only listen to it using my car stereo and older cd players. I can't even put it in my iPod or Zune. I wish I can listen to it while working out in the gym but no can do. :( Lately, I am trying to find a digital download (mp3) of the album but gave up on it. I've decided to just use and overuse the cd until it dies."
4,Many good songs across two discs,"I've been waiting a long time for the new Foo Fighters double album, and I've been listening to Best Of You in a cycle since May. Was I let down? No. Is the album perfect? No. Does it really matter? NO WAY!My favorite disk would have to be the first, the ""hot"" one as the studio would put it. Best of You and DOA are most definately classics, and many others are close. As much as I like the second disk, it just isn't as good as the first. As another reviewer said-- think of it as a bonus album.If you're a fan of the Foo Fighters or rock in general, you'll enjoy this (and probably the acoustic version, too)."
1,Copy protection prevents legal uses...,"I really wanted to buy this disc, but after reading some comments on the copy protection posted on the web, I had to take it out of my cart. As I understand from what I read, the copy protection prevents you from ripping it to your computer, and in turn from loading it on your MP3 player or making a compilation disc which includes music from this CD -- all perfectly legal uses of a music CD under the Home Recording Act. So, basically, although I would have been paying full price for this CD, the bundle of rights I would normally get with it would be artificially limited by the copy protection technology on it. As all my music plays from my PC into my stereo, or in my MP3 player at the gym or while traveling, this disc would be virtually useless for me. I understand the company's desire to protect what they created, but not at the expense of my legal enjoyment of the CD. Maybe if they lose enough sales this way, they'll stop this annoying practice."
1,I've got three words for you - DO NOT BUY,"SEND a message to the greedy record companies and DO NOT BUY to prevent this from happening to other records. This record is copyright proctected which is supposed to block people from copying the record(which was already done the first day it was relased.)but all it does is block people who are law abiding from listing in there cars(with aftermarket MP3 or WMA players) and computers or any mp3/wma compatible device.SO DONT BUY ITNOTE TO THE FOO FIGHTERS, RECORD COMANY AND COPYRIGHT PROTECTION COMPANY AS LONG AS MUSIC MAKES A SOUND YOU CAN RECORD AND COPY IT FOOL FIGHTERS.and this item would have gotten 5stars if i wasnt protected from listening to it!"
3,4 Stars for Content minus 1 Star for CD-Protection,"4 Stars because: I like a lot the first cd, (the regular FF type of), is something I can imagine them playing in a concert. About the second one, I admit it, I have played it only once since about 6 months ago when I buyed. It's not like them. I will be a lie if someone can imagine FF playing the second cd in a concert. It's like country, I don't know.Minus 1 Star because: I read the reviews about the CD-protection, and I didn't believe them, until I tried to copy the mp3 provided by the Cd in another place different than the original PC where I did the first time. This stupid copy-protection told me I was not allowed to use the mp3, me!? the owner of the CD??????. Thanks to ea-pty review, I found this page:http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jhalderm/cd3/please follow the instructions to allow copy mp3s, rip, or whatever you want with YOUR cd."
2,I tried,"I tried to like this, honestly I did, Grohl's vocals just don't do it for me like they did on One by One and Colour and the Shape, I have trouble listening to this CD all the way through. I want the Foo's to do well and put out a new CD to amend for this, but I can't help that.for the record, the copy protection, as most others have said is a terrible idea, I listen to my ipod more than any CD and if I can't put it on there I'm less inclined to listen at all."
2,"Good Music, Bad Media","If you find listening to music on ""their"" terms your idea of a good time, this CD is for you. Don't purchase this CD if you ever plan on using it on a computer. You actually have to agree to a EULA to listen to the music.I won't be buying any CD's that are Listen Protected."
4,I will not buy this or any cd that does not allow me to load into iPod,"Punishing me for buying a legit copy is not acceptable. Wake up. I'd love to get this cd, I read the reviews elsewhere and it sounds like I'd like to own it. But I will not buy a cd that forces me to overcome sophisticated copy-protection in order to personally use it. Can I hear an ""Amen!""?The Foo boys need to stop their label from doing this nonsense, it alienates me, to use a big but perfectly meaningful word."
1,What a shame....,"I'll keep this brief. Musically, the record is great. If you like the Foo Fighters, go and buy this but the whole copyright protection thing kills it for me. Didn't they say that when you ""legally"" bought music, you owned it? Why is it then that in order for me to rip this to my PC ""legally"" I now have to go to itunes (or a similar online music store) and, purchase it again. I know there are work arounds for this issue but after I already own the CD, why should I have to go through the trouble? Acts like this will just push people further to illegally download music in the end. I can see what the Foo Fighters were trying to accomplish here but the execution is poor and the only people they are hurting is their fans."
4,WRITE YOUR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN!,"First off...this album is great. I think it's the Foo Fighters best so far. The problem I have is that the company that made this CD is violating our right to Fair Use. The Fair Use Act guarantees us the right to create back-ups of CDs/DVDs that we purchase legally, so that in the event that the original is damaged, we don't have to buy another copy. You cannot back this CD up because of the stupid program installed on the disk that automatically runs when you insert it. For information on how to remove this ""SPYWARE"" that is installed, you can find articles on the internet. This is a violation of our rights. I urge people to fight against this. Write your representatives and let them know you won't stand for this. While your at it write the record company and send them a copy of the Fair Use Act."
1,I buy CDs with money that can be spent anywhere...,"...why shouldn't I be able to listen to the CD in any device?I own over 4000 original CDs, I'd think I am a good customer for the music industry. But I will NOT buy ANY copy-protected CD.Even if the copy-protection technology is si easy to bypass. I mean, one should NEVER leave auto-run of the CDs activated. What if they istall software without your knowledge? (which is exactly what this disc attempts to do, by the way).Don't buy these discs, and the industry will eventually abandon the technology."
2,F this BS copy protection,"It took me the better part of 2 hours to get rid of the copy protection software this cd installed on my computer. If you buy this CD, make sure you disable autorun for your cd rom drive before inserting the cd, so that software never gets installed in the first place. Don't accept the user agreement that asks permission to install that software either (disabling autorun is simple, just google it).If you already installed the software? Well, you've got some work to do. You'll have to get rid of drivers, system files, and edit your registry. This is the same software that was used on the Velvet Revolver CD. Search google for the fix to that cd and you'll be able to remove the software.After all that, you'll be able to rip mp3's and use them on your ipod and computer. The music on this cd is great - 5 stars. I give 0 stars to the actual cd and it's copy protection for being a pain in my..."
3,Another gripe about copy protection,"This will be the last copy protected CD I will ever buy. After paying for this CD I put it in the computer, went through the process of acquiring licenses, and ripped them to the PC to find that they are only in .wma format. The Mediamax support site says that currently they won't play in iTunes or iPods, and to email Apple's support site to motivate them to fix this problem. This is not Apple's problem - if the most popular MP3 player in the world won't play these tracks, that's MediaMax's problem. So I found a bittorrent of the whole album and then downloaded the whole thing for free. So, the irony is anti-piracy software drove me to piracy, which is just what I will do the next time I see a copy-protected sticker on a CD."
3,I Wish I Could Review The Music,"Just bought this during my lunch hour at work. Thought some new tunes would be a nice way to finish up a rough work week.Unfortunately, thanks to the copyright protection or whatever the hell they did to this, it won't play on my work computer. It is telling me I don't have the authority to play this disc, and that I need to log in as the administrator.What the hell is this? I'm not trying to copy this disc or anything like that. I just want to listen to the damn CD that I bought with my hard-earned money.This thing better import to my iPod or there is gonna be hell to pay.In the meantime, I won't be buying anymore CDs that claim to be protected against unauthorized duplication.So congratulations Sony--in your attempt to ward off some people from making copies of your disc (which they will anyway--there is plenty of technology out there to get around this), you are discouraging other honest people from wasting their time trying to play your discs."
1,"Good Music, Bad Label Decision","I for years have been a fan, and the music is great, but I think the decision to ""protect"" the CD is a poor one. I am a male in mid 30's and have no intentions of file swapping, and I cannot play this on my computer at work, as I can with every other CD I own. I did buy this disk, but will not buy the Dave Matthews disk, nor will I purchase any other Sony disk as long as they have this ""incompatable"" system. I can use my money elsewhere, and not support the greed of a struggling artist and label like the FF and Sony."
3,i dunno,please stop calling the foo fighters ff. we all know there is only one ff and this is fear factory. the foo fighters suck. dave ghrol should go away for a while. kurt cobain told dave ghrol he didn't like his songs. we should have taken a cue from a drugged out dead man. i've heard three or four songs. all of them are the same. there is nothing new. i want my grunge back. the foo fighters time and time again disappoint me. i want their music to be like grunge. they said themselves this was their hardest album. their first one was just a good nirvana rip-off. tell dave to go back to that or go away.
2,What Happened Dave?,"Dude what happened? I just heard ""Best Of You"" on the radio and it's sounds terrible. Then I remembered Dave can't really sing or play guitar. He can scream and play power chords but thats about it.I remember hearing this Dj on a local radio station (who exaggerates alot) say how great this album was and how it made him cry. I mean c'mon, it's the Foo Fighters, not Nirvana. But then again, maybe it's because I don't really like the Foo Fighters. The only song I liked by them is ""There Goes My Hero"", but that's about it.What's with all these bands mellowing out?"
2,Enough Already!,"The Foo Fighters are of a dying breed; the've yet to find their niche between the hard rock of today, and the grunge crap of yesterday. Album after album, the material put forth by the Foo Fighters takes on a redundancy of its own; the songs all sound the same! Please, enough already. Besides, as if to shed some light, the copy protection has already been hacked many times. Seek the answers to the questions you ask and disable the copy protection manually."
4,Dave Grohl - a boy named Foo,"It's been over a decade since former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's Foo Fighters made their impact upon the music scene, and thankfully he and the rest of the crew are not showing their age with this double disc set. ""In Your Honor"" covers both ends of the spectrum; the first disc featuring edgier, hook laden riffs, and the second disc focusing more on a softer, melodic tone. In any case, ""In Your Honor"" succeeds where most double albums fail, by never too wrapped up in itself. The title track, ""The Best of You"", ""D.O.A."", ""The Deepest Blues are Black"", and ""Over and Out"" are all great tracks which showcase that Grohl's songwriting skills have not degenerated over time, even though the album loses speed during the last half of the second disc. Despite that however, ""In Your Honor"" is better than I ever expected, and while it's no ""Colour and the Shape"", what is?"
1,protected cd,I really appreciate the heads up. I was afraid of buying someting advertised as protected. I will just go without rather the encouraging this type activity by record companies and bands
1,Was going to buy it...now I'm not.,"If I can't rip the songs to my computer for import onto my MP3 player, it is no good to me. It was on my list of CDs to buy, but I'll look elsewhere."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,Copy protected CDs place malicious software on your PC. Do not buy this software!
1,I will never ever buy any copy protected CDs,Sorry Foo Fighters. This CD will never be in my collection. I will stop buying CDs altogether if this draconian measure becomes an industry wide standard. Long live vinyl.
1,No to copy protection!,"They really need to get rid of copy protection on CDs. This is a great CD but I'm giving it 1 star to voice my frustration at the system. By the way there are ways around this, just read some of the other posts."
4,UK version has bonus song and is NOT copy protected,"Get the UK version...it's not copy protected and it includes a bonus song on disc one, ""The Sign."" Once again, American consumers are ripped off!"
3,What should be a good value becomes a rip off,"Something needs to be said and done about this record company releasing a ""limited edition"" dual disc and charging up to $15 more than the standard 2 disc version. Most CD's today come out with a choice and there is no more than $3 price difference for those who enjoy the 5.1 surround sound Dual Disc. If that wasn't enough, ONLY the 2nd CD is in 5.1 Surround. What a disaster.. Look, I'm a fan, and this is a decent CD.. CD one is TOO heavy at times, and CD 2 is TOO boring at times, but overall it's an interesting double album concept and likeable record. JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE ""LIMITED EDITION"". There's nothing limited about it, and certainly not worth $14 dollars more than the standard version. So 4 stars for the actual record, and ZERO stars for the packaging and pricing!"
1,Won't buy copy protected cds,"I have 3 iPods. I only listen to music on iPods (one in the car, one for working out, one connected to home stereo). I would never, ever buy a CD that doesn't let me listen to it on my device of choice. Seems very, very stupid to me. I'm also shocked that Dave Matthews would allow greedy suits to do this too. Totally suxs. Guess I'll just have to get them on iTunes."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","Gone are the days of Dave Grohl beating me across the face with ripping guitar riffs, punchy post-punk / post-grunge pop, and general goodness. Here comes an album almost - but not quite - as bad as ""There is Nothing Left to Lose"". And what's more, it's copy protected.Not that the copy protection is worthy of note: if you turn off auto-play, Windows doesn't ever bother you while importing the songs into iTunes, and then you have perfectly iPod-compatible files.This album really left me cold. Hey, Dave: if you're going to copy-protect something, make it something worthwhile."
1,I don't get it,"I normally don't write bad reviews, but I am angry to be stuck with this new album. I have tried, but I can find no redeeming qualities to either of these CDs. I don't know how Foo Fighters could follow up a great album like One by One with such a repetive, non-melodic, badly produced group of songs. The songs all have too much base and sound muffled. There are few if any catchy melodies, and never throughout the whole songs. Then there's the copy protection. On mine, it appears on the acoustic CD. It is obnoxious and makes it diffiult to put songs my iPod or copy them to a mixed CD. Since I have no desire to listen to the songs again, am not trying too hard. I am a musician, so do not support stealing music; but if I want to copy a song from a CD I paid for onto a mixed CD or iPod, I should not have a problem doing it. This CD was a total disappointment."
4,Good for Foo,"I think if you take about 3/4 of the ""hard"" CD, and about 1/2 of the ""soft"" CD, you got yourself a pretty great Foo CD. No major leaps or bounds here, if you have been with Grohl since the beginning. He's always had the hard/soft thing going, and this CD is no exception.There are a few throw-away tracks on each disk, but overall this is a solid effort. I think the 1-2-3 punch of ""In Your Honor"" followed by ""No Way Back,"" and ""Best of You"" is a great opening. On the second, ""Miracle"" and ""On the Mend"" (my personal favorite of the whole album) are the most heartfelt.I still think The Colour and the Shape is his best, but these songs are new and good and won't disappoint anyone who likes these guys."
1,Looks like another download....,"I am the type that downloads music, and then buys the CD if I really think it is a full quality album. That is rare, as everyone knows. I also just bought an iPod Shuffle, and there is no way I will spend my time figuring out how to get around the protection. Yes, there is always a way around it, though im not a hacker so thats not an enjoyable way to spend however long it takes.Guess I will just download....The consumer wins again, Welcome to the new music industry."
1,ugh,"I suggest the new wheezer cd instead, it has more hooks in one song than this whole double cd. This one truely sucks. A double cd without one single hook. ugh, the sameness is brutal."
3,What a dissapointment,"Don't believe all the hype. This, despite Dave Grohls comments, is NOT the best Foo Fighters album. In fact compared to the other Foo albums this ranks (for me) as one of the worst. It easily could have been one disk. I only liked five of the 20 songs on the album. Don't see the need to have Norah Jones on the album as she just mimicks Dave's vocals (besides who the hell is Norah Jones anyway?). About the only cool thing on here is the fact that John Paul Jones of Led Zep fame plays on a couple of the tracks. Snoozer of a Foo album. Go buy one of there earlier better albums."
5,"Great chill music, not hard to MP3","With an easy two step process I had the second CD in MP3 in about 5 minutes flat. The music is great and sounds great on the ipod. Foo fighters has always had that addictive smooth repetitive flow, and acoustic on cd 2 is a great place to chill. Don't be scared away by illegal copy protection. DMCA-- you have the right to back up your music."
3,IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,"good side:two disc set (2nd disc which is the highlight),good band pictures, drummer Taylor Hawkins sings a songbad side:no lyric sheet, insert could be betterstandout tracks:best of me; no way back; free me; resolve; still; another round; over and out; cold day in the sun"
1,Say no to copy protected cd's.....,"This album is available on Kazaa in MP3 format, ready to uplink to your ipod. How's that for copy protection"
1,Won't Play in All CD Players,"My car CD player is only a couple years old, and this CD won't play in it. Plays other discs just fine. I think it's because of the copy protection. And how does that help me? The copy protection does *nothing* to improve the listening experience or enhance compatibility of the disc.What a waste. Why are customers treated like the enemy? That's a great marketing plan they've got."
1,"CD ""protection""? No way!","I like to buy physical CDs for backup in addition to playing them; before MP3s & CDs, I would make taped copies of vinyl records to keep them pristine. NO WAY am I buying any CD that limits my ability to use it, especially if it can't play on my iPod or my Mac. This does not even deserve 1 star, but amazon doesn't provide a zero."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,This CD has a copy protection scheme that makes it totally useless to us 30 million IPod owners! How could a band be so stupid as to alienate such as huge percentage of their fans???
5,continued excellence,"I have been a Foo Fighters fan since their debut album, and I continue to be impressed with their work. I really like their new album. I can't find any tracks in need of skipping. My favorites are 'In Your Honor', 'No Way Back', 'DOA' and 'The Last Song'. I'm especially impressed with the drummer, Taylor Hawkins. I've liked his work since he joined the band, but he really seems to kick it up a notch in this outing. He's really ripping rapid-fire on those drum sets. Very tight. And as always, Dave Grohl is the perfect frontman. Excellent vocals, very emotionally charged, especially when he's screaming the lyrics. I can almost feel him reaching through the speakers to grab my shirt, shake me around and say ""Listen to this! I'm baring my soul!"" Excellent disc 1 and a nice change of pace on the acoustic disc 2. My favorite track from disc 2 is the last one, 'Razor'. This is an excellent release, all around. Highly recommended."
1,...What I think of this copy protected bullshiite,"I will not buy this cd ever due to the fact it is copy protected, infact I will download it and share it to anyone who asks just to spite the company who produced the cd."
3,They went about it the wrong way...,"There's too much filler on this album. When I first heard ""Best of You,"" I was highly dissapointed. Having loved the Foo Fighters ever since The Colour and the Shape, I was hoping for something a little more redeming after One by One. My hopes were let down...way down. Had they released one album with selections from the rock side and the mellow side, this would have been a solid piece of music. Furthermore, the copy protected disc doesn't help. It sounds like crap on my iRiver."
1,Boycott this and make it clear to the RIAA....,"All of my music listening habits rotate around my ipod and itunes music library. Whilst i am sure this is a great album, i refuse to pay for a CD in which i will actually not have full ownership rights to.basically, If I pay for it, then i expect to be able to listen to it in anyway i please, otherwise i will just turn to Kazaa for assistance. It's as simple as that!"
1,Boycott this P.O.S.!,"Don't get me wrong: this is one of the best albums of the year, but boycott Sony's crappy anti-piracy merchandise. I bought this aware of the problems, but I still assumed I would be able to play it in iTunes or even WMP, but NOOOOO it comes with a web-browser jukebox in which you MUST play the album through. I was extremely irritated. Of course, I eventually found a way around it . . . but iwon't list it here. You'll have to find it for yourself."
1,Don't Buy this one.,"The way to get the music industry's attention is through economics. If copy protecting (using sneakware) a cd causes it to be worth less, in terms of sales this practice of infecting your computer with the rough equivalent of a worm wil be stopped.Supply and demand, remember?"
4,Regarding Ripping Issues and the CD,"So first I realize that I am about 7 years late for this review, but for anyone who is looking to buy this CD now. I would like to inform you that it is an awesome CD. Yes the copy protection is stupid, but it is simple to get around. You simply disable auto run/auto play on your PC. Then you rip it to your library. I would suggest to any Foo fan. Don't bother with the one star reviews. The only reason I didn't give it a 5/5 is because the copy protection hinders the experience. Even though it can be worked around. Great buy, great CD, awesome band, etc etc etc."
5,"Is someone getting the best, the best, the best of YOU!!!!!!","""Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of YOU!!"" - Dave Grohl, 2005Those words sum up the entirety of these two stellar discs, probably Grohl's best effort ever. It remains to be seen what else this Superman musician can do, but my money says he will go down as one of the best singer/songwriter's ever to live. The rock part of this dual-disc effort is stunning, on par with Led Zeppelin's greatest work, while the acoustic portion of ""In Your Honor"" reminds me of ""Led Zeppelin III"" by the group Led Zeppelin.Also, I really like how musician Grohl dedicated ""In Your Honor"" to Kurt Cobain. What a classy move.""Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of YOU!!!!"" Dave ""the king"" Grohl - 2005"
4,Acoustic is GOOD,"I just bought the album today and have listened to it 3 times. I just wanted to comment on the people I see ripping the 2nd disc - I thought it was the best!! My girlfriend and I got in an argument right before I had a chance to listen to the second disc (we were following each other in different cars, thank God) and the second disc made me forget all about it! I seriously think Razor is one of the best songs that I have ever heard. As for the 1st disc, it's pretty good too - regular old Foo - I'm glad to get something new. Buy the cheaper disc - it's worth it! While you're at it, pick up the new White Stripes and System of a Down - I buy pretty much all the new rock and those two albums are GREAT! The Exies is another sleeper/surprise worth picking up - Enjoy!"
5,Just buy a Mac and quit worrying about it,"If you people would just buy a Macintosh, you wouldn't have to worry about stupid workarounds for the copy protection. I was able to load this album into iTunes no problem and am able to play it on my iPod and Shuffle. Awesome!Both discs are great, by the way. Especially the acoustic disc. I Highly recommend this album."
1,1 Star for Copy Protection,"It's the age of the iPod. This album rocks like Stonehenge, baby, but I refuse to buy it in CD form because of the STUPID copy protection scheme. The ""geniuses"" who invented this software should be tarred and feathered, and artists better wake up and start refusing to release CDs that have this software on them. Basically, the record companies are making us MAD, and we're all just going to go buy the albums at iTunes in MP3 format. Then we'll see how they like having warehouses full of unsold copy-protected CDs. The clue phone is ringing, Record Industry, and it's for YOU. Get out of your flippin' ivory towers and come down here and live with the rest of us for a while. Somehow you'll still be able to afford the payments on your yachts and Lear jets. I promise."
1,Don't support copy protection!,"The music may be good. Copy protection sucks and is a slap in the face. If you buy this cd, don't expect to be able to play it the way you would your normal cd's. Did the Foo Fighters have any say in this matter? Probably so. They could have insisted the cd not be relased that way."
4,This is a pretty decent cd,"Just because this cd is ""copy protected"" doesn't mean you can't make copies. I have bought other cds that are so called copy protected and I had no problems importing them into my i-pod. Once you copy the cd into your i-tunes folder you can make as many copies as you like. Not that I'm endorsing the pirating of cds. I just think we should be able to make copies for our own personal use. Those of you who are against cd copying let me ask you this: how many times have you bought a cd for one song and the rest of it sucked?If bands want us to stop copying their cds they need to start making better music. This cd is a fine example of a great band in it's prime. If you decide to actually buy this cd I don't think you will be disapointed. The second disc is kinda slow. but it's still ok. I can definitly see a lot of hit singles coming off this album."
1,Why are you people supporting copy protected CDs?!,I love the Foo Fighters and have all their CDs but I am not buying this CD. Because it is copy protected I can't put it on my Ipod. You've got to be kidding. People need to boycott these CDs or the record industry is going to continue to produce them and limit individual usage rights. I'm not wanting to copy and sell the thing. I just want to put it on my Ipod and not have to pay for it twice by buying the CD and then paying again to purchase this CD via Itunes. That is just plain not right. Don't buy this CD and help put a stop to the unfair copy protection process!!!!!! Sorry Grohl.
2,Thanks for the advance warning on protection,"I listened to a copy of this cd from a friend and found both discs to be amazing. I was all ready to buy it from amazon when I saw the reviews indicating the fact that this CD is copy protected in a manner that it wont work with my Ipod. Due to this fact I gave the CD a 2 star review. A CD that does not have the flexibility to allow me to listen to the music I purchased any way I want to is simply useless to me no matter how good the songs are. I simply will not spend my hard earn money on an item that will limit the way I want to use it after I have paid for it legally. I hope other artist, labels and websites get smart and stop this nonesense of trying to control the way customers want to enjoy music. Stop trying to blame us for the declining sales figures for the music Industry and start looking within the Music Industry itself. These are the type of decisions that continue to alienate customers year after year."
2,weak,"These songs all sound so similiar that it does not take long to get bored of this album. The foo's are a great band, but I have yet to hear an album from them where there are more than 3 good songs. The best song on this album is ""the best of you"", and that has a pretty redundant chorus. I wanted to like this album because I was anticipating it, but it is a disappointment."
4,Wow!,"First of all, wow because I can't believe everybody is complaining about the copy protection. Am I one of the few people that still actually plays cd's on cd players? Are discman's that ancient? Second of all, wow because this is their best album since ""The Colour And The Shape"". The heavier disc is awesome. The softer disc is awesome. Overall, wow, awesome. Complainers, Foo you."
1,"Forget the copy protection, this cd SUCKS","I've read all these people who're pissed bc they can't play this cd on their computers and copy them onto their ipods or whatever. I couldn't care less about copying. The music on this album for the most part sucks. Out of TWO DISCS, there are 2 good songs. The rest is boring, muddy, noise. Don't waste your time or money here."
4,One of the leaders of rock's come-back,These guys have to be at least in the top 10 best rock groups today. People need to understand that it takes actual talent to write and perform music.The Foo Fighters have that rare talent. Listen and carry on their message.
1,COPY PROTECTION SHOULD BE ILLEGAL,"For any of us who still buy CDs of artists we love, this new copy protection of ""CDs"" is a total rip-off. The first thing I do when I buy a new CD is rip it to my computer, not to share it with others, but to listen to it myself. I only listen to music on my computer, and therefore, it only makes sense to have mp3 copies of it. This CD doesn't even give you that option, and therefore, I can't give it anything but 1 star, even though the CD itself is good musically. Shame on the Foo Fighters and BMG for performing this injustice on their loyal fans/customers."
5,thank god,"I hope this trend continues. That would be the trend of rock artists actually taking care and writing music. Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters give us hope for a better musical future. This album is terrific. Disc 1 rocks as hard as any other Foo album, and Disc 2 shows off the acoustic wonder that we all knew the foos could acheieve. Stand outs include the lead off/title track ""In Your Honor"", ""No Way Back"", ""Best Of You"" and ""The Deepest Blues Are Black"" from Disc 1, and from Disc 2, ""Miracle"" ""Another Round"", ""Friend of A Friend"" and ""Virginia Moon"". This album is definately worth it, and since the copy protection is not that much of a hassle, its a must buy for any rock fan,"
2,My last Foo Fighters album...,"I was not prepared to see how weak this recording is. Both ""plugged"" and ""unplugged"" discs are weak. The rock CD is weak, the songs have no form, are just a mess of sounds.I knew that after THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE the band could hardly record anything better ever, that album was a gem. But I did not suspect that this new album would be so weak."
5,100 % THE BEST!!! FOR THE FOOS AND FOR THE YEAR,"This is the best Foo albulm yet. It may not contain the best song but overall it is the best. With hearing it over 20 times so far I still have not yet put on the second disc. I don't care yet. It doesn't matter what the dual disc costs...the first disc is priceless. Think of a mix of Nirvana and Sunny Day. It's not as cheery as the past, it seems like Dave has grown back, with a little help from Sunny Day. 100% the best!! Look for a better albulm this year...I dare you!"
2,Tired...,"Seems that D. Grohl has run out of gas. The Foos haven't made a great record since 1999's There is Nothing Left to Lose. The acoustic side is actually pretty decent (***),but the electric side is a bore (*1/2). Oh well, I can always listen to the first three...- cRAIG"
1,Copy Protection is a disgrace!!!,"Reguardless of how good the CD is, I will not purchase something with this ridiculous protection! I like to make mixes of my favorite songs on CD, but with this CD it isn't possible!! What about putting the songs onto my MP3 player? Again, it's impossible with this protection. If I pay MY hard earned money for a CD, I sure as heck better be able to put it on my portable music player!! Wake up, the rights of the consumer are being infriged upon!!! The solution is simple, don't buy this trash!!I will NEVER, I repeat NEVER, but a CD with this protection!!"
3,1/2 great =:o) and 1/2 bad =:o(,"I liked most of the rocky cd... a few not so great tracks... and then on the mellow cd, there was a few great ones but mostly too sad and melancholy. But this is a typical Foo Fighters Album... Deffinately not like the colours and shape album though..."
3,"Great album, but a sub-par DualDisc","I'm only reviewing the DVD sides.Disc 1 is the normal album in Enhanced Stereo which basically just means that Sony BMG didn't want one of their signature albums to be released in a rival format to SACD. The Enhanced Stereo is just 2.0 48/16 which is technically a barely noticeable difference from 44.1/16 which is the standard Red Book spec. I suspect it is possible that the Enhanced Stereo mix may have less dynamic range compression, but I would have to look at the waveforms to confirm this (don't want to go through the trouble).Disc 2 on the other hand is the acoustic album in full DVD-A MLP 96/24 5.1. This disc is excellent and makes the whole deluxe set worth purchasing if you have a DVD-A player.With all the technical stuff aside this is a great album. I would give the CD of this album 5 stars, but this is a special edition and I feel that it should be rated on those merits.Definitely a must buy if you like the Foo Fighters."
1,Why Companies do this with us? (their customers),"This a typical case of damage pre-thinked.The case is that the DVD-Audio side in this case, sounds worst than the Dolby Digital in 5.1. Much worst, very bad.Why? because Sony wants to show us that this format (DVD-Audio) is not sooo good because is not under their license.But I asked: why me, the customer who pay the bill can't enjoy the total supremacy of DVD-Audio format?. Just don't`play with us and beware us about your problems between lebels."
5,The Foos rock again!,This release by Dave Grohl and Co. show once again that they are ready to rock and rock hard!
5,ITS THE FOO FIGHTERS--AGAIN,"People ask me what this albums like, and I say, well, its the Foo Fighters. Most people have given One By One and In Your Honor okay reviews because theyre always looking for the next 'Everlong' or 'My Hero'. This is a complete album, one all rock, and one all acoustic, there is not a bad song on any 5 of their cds, this one adds to the collection. The Foo Fighters are one of the most complete bands in the world and in history, they dont need to do anymore, their place has been set. Every song on here is a gem. For those of you looking for the next Everlong or My Hero, then listen to them."
3,Subtracting stars for software,"I was completely furious that I couldn't play this cd on my computer when it first arrived. I didn't want to copy it, I didn't want to load it into an iPod, I just wanted to PLAY the stupid thing in the computer in my exercise room. It took me at least an hour to figure out how to uninstall and bypass the software just to get it to play properly. I will never buy music from Sony again - not even from iTunes. I love me some Foo, but I want to be able to listen to the music I paid for without becoming infuriated. I'm starting to long for the old days of cassette tapes...."
1,"Don't buy this cd , it install illegal software on your pc","This simple .Don't buy it , it installs malicious software on your pc , and this practice is NOT LEGAL . I don't want to install spyware or anything that I'm not consentient . Do not buy it if you don't want to install an illegal software on your pc .-Other then this , the album is a great energetic work , music is a 5 stars for me ."
1,Boycott the copy-protection by boycotting the CD,"Remember that the consumer is in control here -- their copy protection scheme is forcing people who wouldn't otherwise use P2P networks to just get the music there for free.Foo Fighters -- I suggest you take back control of your career and stop bending over forwards for Sony BMG. And for everyone who wants copy protection schemes to die this year, don't buy this CD, get it somewhere for free, and force Sony and the Foo Fighters to pay the price. Maybe they'll wake up."
1,I Say NO To Copy-Protection,"I will never ever ever ever ever buy a copy protected CD. Never ever ever. I have NO problem buying my music and I never have or will download music illegally, but I will also never let the record companies control my computer when I insert their CD. That kind of attempt is called malicious software.What I will do is buy plain 'ol CDs without copy protection, which this one obviously is not, so I can then have a permanent, unmolested copy of the music I have PAID FOR!! Please do not support copy protection by buying this album. I know it's a lot to ask for you Foo fans, but if we don't make a stand against cripplewear, we're doomed.If record companies/artists want to protect their music as they see fit, then sure, that's fine. But that will only ensure I never buy it at all. Not a good idea."
1,"ummm, what about my ipod ?!","I only have time to listen to music on the subway. And my only means of doing that is through my ipod. If I can't copy this CD to my ipod, I'm spending my hard earned money elsewhere!"
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Can't be played on an MP3 player due to a ""brilliant"" copy protection scheme that causes lots of problems, especially if you play it on your computer."
1,Copy Protection? Bah!,"Nope. I'm not buying this one. I'll never buy ANY CD containing so-called ""copy protection"". Thanks for making this CD useless to iPod users."
1,"Great music, useless CD","I bought this CD without looking carefully enough at the packaging - it contains copyright ""protection"" that prevents you from being able to rip the tracks to your computer or load them onto an mp3 player. You can only listen to it on your computer if you let it install its special software on your system. If I buy a CD I think I should be able to listen to it on my own computer without letting Sony/BMG litter my system with their crappy software. Since you can already buy the album from the iTunes store, I don't really see why they don't want you to be able to listen to it on your mp3 player. Are they expecting me to purchase the album twice? Screw that! I already bought the CD, I should be able to listen to it however I want."
1,Greedy Bastards!!,"I will never buy a CD that uses this copyright system again. I just want to put the CD on on IPod. But no, it's not that simple. I have wasted hours trying to get the music on to my IPod with no success.I heard that David Grohl said that we were lucky that we only had to pay the price for one CD. At the same time he admited that their last CD sucked.Well if I can't use the CD I purchased, the way I want, the price will never matter!! I will never buy another CD that uses this copyright system."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't get me wrong. I love the Foo Fighters. I have most of their music. But this has to be the biggest load of garbage I've seen from a company that I'd think would be better than that.I don't like to carry around my ""originals."" I copy my music to put in my car, listen on my ipod, and use in my home system, so that i prevent any potential damage to my CD. This is NOT pirating music! And if I can't copy this, I won't buy it. If I pay for it I should have the right to make a copy for myself.And like anyone else, too, I DO NOT want to BUY garbage to put on my computer.Don't waste your money. If you use iTunes, you'll be lucky to buy it and download it, but don't waste your money on this album. Boycott Illegal Garbage."
1,Not compatible w iPod?!? :( WTF,"You would think that in this day and age that musicians and record companies would adopt to the new standards instead of trying to vear music enthusiasts away from file sharing. For the most part, file sharers are not downloading thousands of songs for free; they are usually sampling songs before they go out and buy the CD or a related CD (genre, band, etc.). I wish that sony/bmg would get off their high horse and realize that iPods are hear to stay and that Mac fans deserve a break in the music scene. Mac's should be able to play the CD and you should and do have the right to copy the songs. Therefore sony/bmg are taking away the users rights to copy songs to their iPods by not being mac compatible."
1,BEWARE OF THIS CD,"Not only does is this CD not compatible with ipods, but I have had all kinds of problems playing this CD on my computer because of the copy protection. If you intend to use this CD on an ipod or computer, don't bother buying it.I am a long time Foo fan and I'm very disappointed with this CD. Had I known about the copy protection in advance I would never have purchased it since for me it was a waste of money."
1,"Foo Fighters cool, Digital Rights Management bad","I'd love to buy this album, but I'm against copy-protection. Sorry, RCA and Foo Fighters, but you lost a sale.My rights don't need management!"
2,Worthless,"Good band, good songs, this review is for the product itself - the physical CD which is completely worthless. Doesn't matter how good the music is if you can't listen to it. Copy protection has made it completely unusable in my Squeezebox-centered music environment (I rip my CDs and then never use them again and wirelessly stream all music to home theatre system). In this case I can't rip the music so I can't listen to it with my existing hardware."
1,Cutting Off Your Nose To Spite Your Face,"While every corporation/radio station/(insert organization here) is giving away Ipods & Mp3 players, Foo Fighters' record label decides that in order to cut down on piracy, they will prevent us (buying customers) from being able to download this cd into our music libraries. The old phrase above comes to mind.Luckily I haven't opened the CD yet and I damn well plan to return it. Not to make a statement but simply because I consider music 75% pointless if I can't listen to it on my portable audio.IDIOTS!"
1,Will not buy,"I had planned on buying this, I was looking forward to the new album for a while now. Luckily I read the reviews here. I will not now or ever buy a CD that limits my playing capabilities. If that means that I limit my new music purchases, so be it. There's a lot more out there. Thanks RCA for saving me $17."
1,Sony knows best,"Copy protect this Sony!From the ones that brought us SACD surround (before dropping it, after not promoting it) and SACD playing on their DVD machines (without the ability to play the competition DVD-A surround format): Sony now presents us with copy protection that also screws around with our computers.Even though I would love to have the surround disc (only 1 of the 2 discs) I think I will skip this one Sony, just like I have passed on your playing equipment. Pass the Beta, fools!"
1,Limited Edition also copy protected,"While only the regular edition is listed as copy protected by Amazon's information, the Limited Edition is copy protected as well. There is even a small note stating that the audio portion of this Dualdisc does not conform to CD standards; so this isn't a CD. Thats terrible. Here's a note to all bands releasing copy protected ""CD""s . I am a customer and a fan, not a thief - Treat me as a theif and i will not be a customer or a fan anymore. I don't buy copy protected discs, so this one goes back. Pity. Disabling Auto-Insert works, but I shouldn't have to."
5,Awesome collection!,The Foos have such a unique sound and they make great music. i love this cd and recommend it!
1,Thanks Everyone,"After reading through pages of your reviews, there's no way I'd ever buy this cd. Love the Foos. What a dumb move. The bands I know of who sell the most music are the ones who actually give a lot away. The fans love it so much, they ""want"" to go out and buy their music whenever something new is available. Maybe Sony needs a psychology lesson."
3,In Dave's Honor,"This album's OK. I was psyched to hear the acoustic, given Grohl's frequent translations of his bitchin' hard rock into sublime acoustic. But I gotta say, Grohl is a second rate Ryan Adams, whose Cold Roses blows out Grohl's attempts at the acoustic.On the otherhand, I'm diggin' the Disc One. Great hard rock, although it does start to meld together after a few listens. Good to work out to though."
5,HAcross America by Art Garfunkel,Couldn't get this from suppliers in Australia. Forever grateful to Amazon for suppling a wonderful DVD which met or exceeded our expectations. As Simon and garfunkel fans to be able to add this to our collection completes the range of things that the artists have done either together or a solo artists.
2,I was majorly disappointed,"I'm sorry to contradict the other reviewer, but I think this book was poorly edited and had a strange storyline. I must've found about 30 typos. Unless you are interested in volleyball, you will be quite bored throughout half the book. From the summary on back, it looks as if it has a little volleyball in it, but the game takes up much of the book. Things come out of nowhere, and for stupid reasons. I read this book vacationing at the beach, and I left it there. I recommend it only for deep thinkers who also enjoy hearing every detail of volleyball games."
4,Perfect,"This fits our adult dragon very well, he doesn't seem to mind at all . It is secure and has a long leash."
1,"Cursing in a ""children's"" book?! For shame!","As a middle school teacher and as a mother, I don't let my children or students use some of the language in this book. Why would I allow them to read it? The mother is a very poor example of what a mother should and should not do--smoking indoors around a baby and child and leaving an eight-year-old alone with a baby. There is no redeeming value in this book. I can't believe it won a Newberry Honor medal."
4,What Jamie Saw,"The book I read was What Jamie Saw .I enjoyed the book for many reasons. The main reason I enjoyed the book was that it had a good story line that was very easy to follow. I felt the author did a good job writing the story, yet the author could have possibly used the character Van a little more. I feel the book reflects people's lives more than I know because in the book Van drank and hurt the baby. All in all I would recommend What Jamie Saw because of its content and how it was written. I can understand why it has been on the following book lists: Newbery Honor Book, 1996 National Book award finalist, ALA Notable Book, and Booklist Editors Choice. This selection is a good book for older readers and is a very enjoyable book."
4,What Jamie Saw,THis book has a lot of emotional fellings in it. THe mood is very powerful and and can be suspenseful at times.
2,The book was a little borring. There was hardly any action.,"The book ""What Jamie Saw"" was about a boy named Jamie, his mom, his sister Nin, and his dad Van. Van gets mad and throws Nin across the room. Then Jamie's mom takes them all to find a trailer in the middle of nowhere. It is very cold and small. I did not think this book was very good. There was hardly any action."
3,There were a lot of problems and not all of them were solved,This book's story was about a young child named Jamie. He was involed in a family crisis. Our opinion is that this book was average. We would have liked to see more action. It was a good book but it just didn't click. It got confusing because it's intensity was like a roller coaster ride. Each problem was short and not well detailed. Just because it got a Newbery Award doesn't mean it's great.
3,What Jamie Saw,"What Jamie Saw by Carolyn Coman is not that great of a book in my opinion.It is about a little boy named Jamie who oneday sees his mom's boyfriend throw Jamie's little sister, Nin across the room and soon after they decide to move out. I thought that the author couold of made the book a bit more exiting towards the end. this book i would probaly recomend for boys and girls who enjoy reading a little bit of drama!"
1,So Stupid,This book is not even close to what happens in real live because a mother is not going to walk in the room at the same time her baby is being thrown across the room and catch it. I think that would be impossible also this book starts off really weird you would need to read the whole book to understand the beginning of this book. This book was a waste of my time!.
2,"Too much history, not enough about how the courses play","I wanted a book that described how some of the best Arizona courses play so I could plan my trips to this beautiful state accordingly. What I got was of the history behind some Arizona courses- who designed them, how design decisions were made, and other historical trivia. There is very little attention given to how each course plays, the amenities, or the conditions. There are a couple of descriptions of a few holes, but very little depth. The stories are somewhat interesting, and the photos are beautiful, but overall it does not deliver what golfers most likely expect."
4,"Wonderful movie, better on DVD","This is simply a wonderful movie. It is available on DVD as an extra on ""Black and White in Color"". The quality is amazing on that DVD. 5 stars for the movie on that DVD. 4 stars here on VHS."
4,A sociological participation on ganja,"This isn't the easiest read out there, but not bad. The author does give a new viewpoint of Rastifari culture and does a good job at putting it in sociological and historical perspective. Only in a couple of places do I think that he got deep enough into the culture that he kind of lost non-judgemental perspective, but he does try to show viewpoints from various sides. I can say that I learned a fair amount about the Rastifari culture and would recomend this book."
2,Weak and not very believable,"I purchased the book after hearing the author speak at a journalism conference. Despite her enthusiasm and reported attention to details, the book fell far less than what I'd hoped for.My biggest disappointment: That nearly brand-new copies aren't going for more than a buck on Amazon Marketplace. Anyone wanna buy mine -- I didn't read it completely?"
3,"Pas mal, mais....","I knew we were in trouble when Mayle's sequel to his delightful ""Year in Provence"" opened with vignettes on constipation and suppositories. Oh, Mayle's fresh and breezy style is here, and he still has an eye for small but telling details, but this is mainly a retread of the same ground he worked in the much more cohesive ""Year in Provence."" We are told, yet again, about annoying guests, fraud in the truffle trade, and the arrogance of outsiders who are invading Provence and turning it into a playground for the rich, which is rich coming from a man who has plenty of money to finance his enviable lifestyle and quests to discover the origins of pastis!All that said, Mayle has a talent for evoking place, and his descriptions of memorable meals will leave you salivating. But you can get all that, in better form, in A Year in Provence."
4,Almost As Good as Being There.,"Like Provence, Mayle continues to charm with further adventures from the land of food, wine, and sunshine. If you haven't read ""A Year In Provence"", I'd suggest starting with that as many of the ""characters"" he introduced make return visits here. Less structural than his first book, these chapters come off as varied meditations on random events that occur day to day; A birthday picnic, a new found pet,the search for gold in his backyard, and of course the various gastromical pleasures to be found throughout the region. I didn't find it quite as good as the first book, but still he has a way of making you feel like you're sitting down with an old friend."
4,"Good, but not as great as A Year in Provence",I didn't think that this book was quite as good as A Year in Provence. But it was still very amusing. I'd recommend reading A Year in Provence first before reading this book so you better understand everything he is referring to.
2,Toujours Provence,I enjoyed Mayle's first book A Year in Provence a lot better than this book. If you want to learn about French food and meals then this book will help you. But it is not as funny as his first book.
3,Encore Provence!,"A beautiful follow up to A year in Provence. Continues on the hilarious insights into French country life. It inspires to the point that you want to brush up on your school french, eat baguettes and brie, and pack up en route to a new life in the south of France."
4,Escapist fun! 4 1/2 stars,"I am surprised and delighted to say that I enjoyed this even more than the first book in the Provence series. Perhaps the familiar, breezy writing and characters just transported me to a lush, easy life. I also think some of these stories are hysterical! From singing frogs to the aquisition of their new dog there is just pure joy in these pages. A great, quick read. Can't wait to go on to Encore Provence."
3,"Eh, not that funny","A series of pastiches of life in Provence. If you don't speak French, a lot will be lost on you. If you do because you have spent time in Provence, the characters will appear familiar.However, the tales are not that funny or even amusing. In addition, they're from the point of view of an Englishman, so it has a twist that at times really doesn't work for American readers (comparisons of school food in France and Britain, etc.)My wife read ""Une annee en Provence"" and felt the same lack of interest in this volume as I do.It is redeemed mostly by Mayle's talent as a writer. Some of his descriptions and meals are very, very well done. But again beyond painting the picture, it's not funny or insightful."
5,Toujours Provence,"Another ""le home run"" by Peter Mayle. He makes the reader feel that he or she is right by his side as he discovers new restaurants, goes to market, or takes part in a fantastic experience tasting wines in a local cave. After two of his books I feel like I know the locals and could feel right at home in his village. His books are difficult to put down. I found myself looking forward to ""going to Provence"" for a few chapters every evening. Thank you Peter."
4,breezy episodes in the south of France,"Mayle's style is light and breezy; he does the joie de vivre thing as in his first Provence book. This book is really an elaboration of the episodes in A Year in Provence. Mayle does insert new characters and gustatory adventures that keep the reading lively however.There are many charming anecdotes in this book. Mayle is a first-class storyteller who drops alot of French words throughout his narrative in English. This, along with his modest humour, really make this a decent read.Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"
2,"Pleasant taste, ineffective relief for me","In my personal experience, neither the liquid nor the tablets provided anything more than a very brief respite from heartburn. While the taste was pleasant, the relief was minimal at best. I won't be buying this brand again."
5,Amazingly well done perspective,"The story is written in a 1st-person narration. Normally that really annoys me. It keeps snagging on the story like a ragged fingernail snags on cloth. But this author.... It flowed so smoothly, was written so well, that you just don't notice. I'm not sure if i've ever read another author that could do this so well. I keep waiting for a sequel, and waiting, and waiting..... :("
5,A Great Vamp Read,"I loved this book so much I went and found out this author has 2 pen-names he uses for other genres. The story is untypical for a vamp novel in that the main character begins with no memory and has to discover he has become a vampire. The end of the book is good, but it left me waiting for another book that has yet to make an appearance. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a great read, all vamp lovers, and mystery buffs! Grab a copy while you can because most people that read this one continue to hang onto it."
3,"Good for parents, not the classroom because lacking pictures","I am a health teacher for middle school students and I was looking for materials to supplement my lectures. Unfortunately, this is just lecture on video. We used it a little bit in class just so the kids could see someone else talking about the same stuff but should be used in small doses.I can see parents liking this video if they want to get caught up on the latest information regarding sexual education or if they are too embarrassed to discuss some of the topics and prefer the ""so, do you have any questions?"" at the end of the segments.The good thing is that it covers a lot of topics that have come up often in the classroom (and some that the kids don't know how to ask, but should be discussed anyway) so it's nice to see something comprehensive...it's just lacking any kind of interesting visuals for students who are forced to watch it in the first place."
4,Covers the awkward subjects in Health Class,"Is this DVD perfect? No! Does it cover topics awkward to discuss? YES. I teach Health at a High School in California and I'm appreciative of this DVD in that it does cover sexual topics in a straight forward manner. It does not have the splashy special effects and camera work that is standard on most science presentations, but the sincere forthright manner of it's presentation is on target for reaching high school age students. My students listen and watch attentively. I would recommend this DVD for a High School Health class. The organization is such that you can pick and choose the topics you need."
1,This video is terrible,"This video shows a few people talking and talking and talking. No illustrations just a very masculine woman an effeminate man with a rather large shiny earing and an old black man who talks about menstruation.The focus seems to be preventing STDs and AIDs and basically encourages your kids to think that ""if it feels good - do it, you're normal, it's all OK""One intro discussion includes descriptions of the various kinds of very ""normal"" sex as anal, oral and vaginal. I don't know what other parents were looking for but this DVD was not the ice breaker I was hoping it to be for my young girls."
2,Speakers are not very good speakers,"In showing several segments of this lecture with teens, my opinion is that the OB/GYN speaks too fast and looks to the side as if reading. He has one of the longest parts and he races along with an odd cadence. The older woman speaks slowly and well and more attention was paid to her and the younger woman speaking about planned parenthood. The Dr. (Urologist)seemed bored with the subject.There are many other DVD's out there that also show teens speaking about the peer pressure and need for education that had my audience rivited to the screen. As another reviewer said, this is a lecture on tape. There is no interaction with others, no questions from an audience are answered and even if I was a student interested in the subject, this video was too much information in too short a time, presented in a way that showed no creativity and created no interest."
4,Not enough of the good bits,"I bought the cd for the love theme which i think is outstanding and reminds me of ancient Egypt, or at least Egypt and its very romantic. And takes me back to the film.I just dont think there is enough of it and its not long enough, and maybe the cd contains a lot of music that im not too fond of although i cant name them offhand.The sand volcano is the standout track, right at the end and overall it is an excellent soundtrack and reccommended."
4,Stylish Score !,"If you wish to hear action desert score, this is defenitly the one. Probably the best track of the cd, the sand volcano delivers all the power of Goldsmith talent, with a variety of instrumental music. Of course, that's not the best of Goldsmith but try it either and you won't be disappointed by this score."
5,This CD will see a lot of wear!,"I'm a published fiction writer, and I'm always looking for great soundtracks to inspire me as I write, that evoke a backdrop of drama, adventure, and romance. The Mummy will always be one of my favorites! There's lots of variety--from the rousing adventure of ""Tauger Attack"" and ""Night Boarders"", to the dark, eerie promise of ""The Crypt"" and ""Discoveries"", to the enthusiasm and competitive fervor of ""Caravan"" and ""Camel Race"", every song pumps with energy. See if you can spot Evelyn's, Rick O'Connell's, and Imhotep's themes threaded throughout the tracks...each theme fits its character so well. Thanks, Mr. Goldsmith, for a fabulous soundtrack that feeds my imagination!!"
2,Average Music Without Enough Variety,"This soundtrack by Goldsmith falls into the age-old soundtrack trap: repetative tracks. There are very few themes in this one. Although it is a catchy one and exciting (for a time), I feel like Goldsmith scratched the score out at the last minute and decided not to go the extra mile. Download this one as an MP3 and save your money. Spend it on a John Williams score."
3,Hollywood hokum,"As a rule, soundtrack albums are quite worthless without the visual element of the film-and more often than not worth much more with it. So I did not expect much from <The Mummy> (Decca 289 466 458-2), not having seen the film and not intending to after reading the reviews. But on first playing, the hokiness of the Jerry Goldsmith score caught my fancy in much the same way as ""In a Temple Garden"" or ""Song of India"" or other ersatz melodies ""from afar."" I also am fond of North African music anyway, and so I really enjoyed this in spite of such segment titles as ""My Favorite Plague"" and ""Camel Race."" Silly stuff but harmless."
1,This soundtrack was very CREATIVE!,The sountrack was very creative on the cover but that was about it. The music was boring and unpleasant.Although I am still waiting to see how it fits to movie.
4,HIS BEST ONE SINCE POLTERGEIST.4 and a 1/2,"This is a very very good soundtrack.Jerry Goldsmith once again proves to us that he is ""the"" film composer and just below him,John Williams ofcourse.Very exciting."
4,Normal Peoples' Review,"While I'm not an instrument player or an educated music expertin any sense, I feel that this filmtrack was a great one. They allsound great especially when seperate themes are present such as what I refer as to the ""Hero's"" theme demostrated on track 3,5,13 and 15. Its also got a romantic theme as well as background themes which I also like. The only thing this filmtrack did not have was the song which accompanied the scene when the main character O'Connell was flying in the plane and crashed. I thought that song would have been a great addition to the soundtrack. In my opinion it is a great soundtrack to buy and I cannot wait for the next Mummy soundtrack to come out next year."
4,Good? Yes. Original? Hardly.,"As a previous reviewer claims this is ""original"" versus Star Wars' ""Duel of the Fates,"" I must protest. This score continues the themes began by Maurice Jarre (_Lawrence of Arabia_) and even Camille Saint-Saens in his ""Sampson et Delilah"" or ""Marche Militaire Francaise""--i.e., sweeping desert themes combined with 'arabian' percussion and tonalities. The result is a pleasant score, if somewhat fast-paced and frenetic; the only real peaceful moment comes in the final track. Still, worth having, especially as a mood piece."
1,Tooooooooooo Sweet,"I have found that Edy's ice cream is too sweet. When I first tasted it about 4-5 years ago it was very good, but it seems like they put more sugar in it and ruined it. And what happened to ""Homemade""? It seems to have disappeared.I don't see any Spumoni in our area (20708) either?"
5,african cats dvd,"this is a really great and wonderous dvd; the grandboys love it. lots of great shots of lions, cheetahs, and leopards.This is really stupid to make me have to put in a certain number of words. Because of this, I will never do an purchase review again."
2,Disappointing. . . .,"Although some of the cinematography was very good; the story line was not good. To me, it seems as though they took a lot of video clips of animals and edited the clips to try and make a story out of it."
1,I wouldn't buy from this company again.,"The video was worthless to us as we could not watch it. As it was entered into the player, it came up on the screen that the video could not be played as it was designated for another part of the world."
3,my 5 year old daughter loves cats,"My daughter got this movie for Christmas, she likes it but, honestly I have seen better nature shows on PBS. It just isn't in the same league as Disney World and Oceans."
3,Who Likes Big Kitties?,"Who doesn't enjoy watching lions and cheetahs lick each other for 89 minutes? I sure do! Not only does the documentary AFRICAN CATS capture the elegance of the hunt (the cheetah keeps her head absolutely still as her shoulders fluidly undulate with each careful step as she stalks an antelope in the tall grass), the intrigue of a rival lion's plans for world domination, and the creepiness of hyenas always lurking piercing the night with their menacing Joker's laugh, it also features adorable newborn cheetah cubs (they look like furry snowcones!)."
1,Movie is excellent; poor rating b/c of forced Blu-ray purchase,"It would be nice if Disney/Disneynature would offer either/OR regular DVD or Blu-ray. I do not have nor want to buy a Blu-ray player. And I'm not willing to shell out almost $30 because of a seemingly great deal ""combo pack."" Just give me the regular widescreen DVD for whatever a normal movie costs -- $15 or so. This packaging is a total rip off. Disney should be ashamed. I hope this movie becomes available in other formats soon - I'd really like to see it again."
4,True story,"The story of this film is so exciting. I am interested in this topic I really love the big cats and their environment, the savanna, etc. The scenes are wonderful so I like this produciton. The only negative impression is the narration it is a little bit boring I think. Because this I give 4 star for this film."
5,Wonderfull.,"This movie was just awesome. It almost made me cry. It was very sad when the lioness leader died. However, it still had a beautiful and happy ending. I think that the mother cheetah was proud of her young in the end."
1,Rated for the Forced Blu-ray Combo Pack,"What is with you distributors? Sony, and now Disney! You know, I wanted to see this movie, and I might even buy the DVD -- but not if you jerks are forcing me to buy a Blu-ray disc! I don't have a Blu-ray player. I don't want a Blu-ray player! I don't want to pay you people extra for a Blu-ray disc! Just sell me the DVD all ready! Nothing like greed and corruption to ruin the American economy!"
3,For Those About To Watch; A Helpful Hint...,"Here's an annoying little thing that you'll have to do, before watching this movie, and that is to put on the, ""English Captions"", as there are several scenes with Romanian dialog (which I at first mistook for being benign, since there was no automatic English subtitling, but upon further viewing, noticed that too much Romanian dialog was being used, for it to just be for effect)But here's the rub, there's no option to only have the Romanian dialog subtitled, so you're forced to watch the whole movie with the English subtitles, as there's only one English subtitling option on the subtitling menu :(If anyone else has discerned a way to watch this movie with only the Romanian language subtitled, I'd be glad to hear from them, but I'm afraid that it looks like, there isn't :("
2,Disappointing!!,"Being a big fan of the Prophecy series, I was extremely disappointed with this movie and the one after (Prophecy:Forsaken). All the elements of the first two and even the third film were missing. Where was the creepiness or angelic awe in this film? Christopher Walken was great in the first three but I don't even think his presence in this film would have made much difference."
3,"""here is a detailed review""","It's British, it's cheap and the special effects are almost non existent. What more do you need to know ?"
3,Uprising,"The fourth sequel in the Prophecy series, sadly lacks Christopher Walken. It was a decent movie, however, which I enjoyed. I'm looking forward to the release of the next installment. I'm hoping it returns to the quirkiness of the original."
2,Not much better than the original.,"My Motorola i580's original battery would only last a couple days so I bought this extended battery. Its not much better. I might get 2 1/2 days out of a full charge, and it make my phone quite a bit thicker. Not really worth the money."
5,You Can Never Have Too Many Clamps,"My woodworker husband purchases clamps at least once a year from Amazon. He always buys Bessey and has been well served by them. As any woodworker knows, you can never have too many clamps."
4,As advertised:,"The clamps with the bench stand-offs set up quickly, worked well, and easily, to clamp mitred corner hardwood cabinet door rails and stiles."
3,Incomplete Shipment After Two Tries,"This is a good box and lid at a great price. I intially received only the box and divider - no lid, strap, mounting bracket, or screws. Northern Tool did not respond to my email. A phone call to customer service went well; they were very courteous. They would send out another complete set. This time, I received just the box and the lid... It's not worth my time to ask for the strap and mounting bracket/screws a third time. It's a nice battery box, but I won't risk ordering products from Northern Tool again."
1,Non-removable Logo on Box,"It's a decent box; it performs as described. I do not like NOCO's box because you simply cannot remove their intrusive logo. I have doused it in acetone and tried everything possible to remove it... it can't be done. If you buy this product (and I wouldn't do so again,) then get used to the huge sticker because you cannot remove it. At least, I managed to make it unreadable with the acetone.Steven SmithCorpus Christi, TX"
4,Bessey VCLIP-8S,Product arrived on time. The sliding arm is an interesting addition to the spring clamp. I have found that it works satisfactory.
4,Make sure you don't buy the earlier 1992 edition.,"Please note that I am not rating the 1995 edition. Mine is the earlier 1992 edition and it is OK as a pocket dictionary, but it has a huge section of supplemental signs appended. They were probably added as an afterthought, but you have to look up a word twice to see if it is in that edition. No one complains about that problem in this 1995 edition, so I guess the publisher cleaned the book up. Anyway, my main dictionary is the Costello Unabridged dictionary. I am learning ASL from a great free website ([...]) but need both an unabridged dictionary as well as a pocketsize abridged dictionary to refer to when I am not near the computer. See my review of the Costello Unabridged Dictionary for details. This book has good drawings that are not too small despite the pocketbook size. I use it all the time when I am travelling, and despite the limited size of the vocabulary, it has many of the signs I am frequently looking for."
3,"For what you pay, it works OK!","I don't know what all the complaining is about. For the price, I wasn't expecting a ""professional"" finished product, but it does what it says! If you follow the directions carefully, you'll eventually get some decent buttons after a little practice and experimenting. It's plastic, so don't slam it or exert too much force - and I think it will last beyond it's cost."
3,Assistance is needed,"In order to put enough pressure to put backing on an additional person was needed.Other than that I thought the buttons allowed for creativity, they could draw, use stickers and even stamp a paper! The final product of the button is cute. The kids love it. They did want to be able to put the whole thing together without my help.The kids ages range from 7 - 10 years old.I would recommend this if I knew the person purchasing will in fact help the kids complete the project."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!,"1 star is only because I had to put at least 1.Otherwise I would given it zero stars ( if there was a negative five stars that would be the given review). This product is horrible! horrible! horrible! I purchased the Badgemaker thinking that this would be the perfect and fun project for my students. However, I was greatly disappointed when trying Badgemaker product out at home, the first button was difficult. When I attempted the second the inside prong bent, By the third use It broke. Ultimately I had top return the product to the store. DO! NOT! BUY!!!!!!"
1,"Don't buy ""2nd edition"" unless you're blind","The ""2nd edition"" (2010) from Read How You Want Press is identical to the 1998 edition, except they've increased the font size to 16 points (HUGE), made the book bigger (8"" x 10"") and heavier, and doubled the price. Save your money and get a the older edition, which you can carry with you on a hike."
4,WONDERFUL BOOK!,"This has always been my favorite book, and I have collected copies over the years. This by far, is one of the nicest books of A Christmas Carol, one I will always treasure.It is beautifully presented and very reasonably priced."
3,Annotations get in the way,While the annotations are interesting I think I'd rather have them in a separate book of essays about Dickens and his world as I found them too distracting while trying to read the actual book.
1,Phenomenal Element Series,"Peter Kater continues in his extraordinary yet simple style of providing music in the Element Series. I purchased the ""Fire"" CD of the series initially, and was so taken with it, that I immediately purchased the remaining 3 ""element"" CD's. Ranging from haunting to self-conscious, there is a presence to the the ""Fire"" CD that resonates with the soul. For any music lover who searches for music that provides the soundtrack to life in all of its facets, the ""Fire"" CD, as well as the entire Element series, is a must!"
2,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed. I expected the book to focus more on trans-racial adoption, but I failed to see that. In this book the writer simply looks for things that are brown like her. Maybe on the child level this is a good book about the color brown, but my son much prefers, ""Black is Brown is Tan"" and ""I Don't Have Your Eyes"" over this book."
3,"Great Story, But. . .","The content of the story is great, especially for kids who are adopted transracially and are beginning to notice that their skin is a different color than their parents. However, I HATE the illustrations. One of them is pretty creepy, so we don't read it much. I'm thinking about making my own picture book using pictures from magazines/photos/etc. and laminating it for my kids."
3,It's okay.,The little guy I bought this for is only an infant. It will take a few years for him to understand to know how we all really feel about the book.
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"The reproduced photos are, indeed, of very low quality. What disappointed me most, though, was that it seems aimed at a tiny child. My six year old, who has been nearly insatiable for adoption-related discussions and reading, put it down, bored, within seconds. He hasn't picked it up again."
4,Brown Like Me,This book gives my son positive things to compare in the world that are similar to his skin tones.
2,Not Very Helpful,"The instructions in this book are hard to understand and follow. I learned how to knit a few years ago and bought this book to re-teach myself, and had to go online to find instructions that actually helped. Most of the patterns in here are things 12 year old girls from the late ninteties might like, but aren't really appealing to a 21 year old. I would not recommend this book."
3,Tries too hard,I think that I much prefer my Everything Knitting book. The Cool Girl's Guide to Knitting has some fun projects but over all it is not much of knitting guide.I also did not enjoy how it made fun of other knitters as if I am so much cooler because I am not old/ hippie/ novice or what ever else. If you want some cute knitting projects you could try Glam Knits by Stephanie Japel. I haven't knitted any of of Glam Knit's projects but I have looked at them in the library and they are much cuter than what was in the Cool Girl's Guide.But if you want help with knitting for a novice I suggest Everything Knitting. I am always looking to it for advice or when I make mistakes.The Cool Girl's Guide is not terribly written and you could use it as a guide if you were a novice.
2,Meh,I honestly bought this book on a dare while I was out with my knitting group. Most of the patterns in here are hideous. I decided to give one of the patterns a chance and I made the shark coat for my dog for halloween. Luckliy I have been knitting for a while because the pattern does not mention how to do a few of the techniques. At least it was under 6 dollars.....
1,My worst experience with soup ever!,"Okay, going through the reviews, I anticipated that the soup will be pretty good- at least somewhat decent- despite being ""instant,"" because I've had some good instant soups before.Well, after trying one packet, I was so disappointed! :( I should have NEVER ordered this!! What a waste of money... It tastes like Maruchan ramen noodle soup, but much worse, and it's so salty as well! I had to add like two cups of water, not 3/4 cup as told in the directions. I should have ordered instant Nong Shim noodles instead. The rest of the soup boxes will be donated to somewhere..."
1,"Yukky, sodium-laced junk food","I can't believe I paid a nickle of my hard-earned money for this stuff.I also can't believe all the good reviews it got. You put it in a cup, add 3/4 cup of boiling water and stir it up. A bunch of white stuff that may be dried noodles will be floating on top. After a LOT MORE stirring, and it's been sitting there for a while (long enough to be too cool to eat), the noodles get more-or-less soft.Take a sip. It taste like hot tap water with a hint of chicken broth. On top of that it gave me heartburn. I guess THAT part is MY problem, and YMMV.I won't even give this junk away.Read the label: One CUP of this ""soup"" has 25% of the daily requirement of SODIUM!"
1,cost way too much,"At 48 dollars for 12, it's highway robbery. Doing the math, that comes out to 4 dollars a box. Each box has four envelopes, that means a doller per envelope. You can go to Drugstore.com and get it for half that price. Not to mention I can buy individual boxes, I don't have buy in bulk."
4,Good Soup,I have been eating this soup for several years. It is very good and I like the Tomato as well.
2,Needs some work,"It's not too expensive, so not too bad of an investment if you need a quick snack lunch and don't have access to a microwave or such. It does take 2 packets for a decent mug of soup, and you really do need to let it brew in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Adding croutons does help, but overall it's not that great-there are better offerings out there. I don't think I'll get another order, sorry."
5,hard to find,I use these soup packets when I cook. I have not been able to find them in the stores anymore. What a great price too!
5,Best of the bunch.,This is my favorite flavor of the Lipton Cup-a-Soups. It has a good flavor without having too much salt.
4,"Can easily be spruced up...cheap ""mini meal""","I had high hopes for this product. you really need to use at least 2 packages to get enough flavor in a single cup if you're not adding any additional goodies to it.I like to make it in a coffee cup and add some shredded carrots and veggie crumbles to spruce it up a bit. since there are so many in the package it will last me quite a while and I can keep them in my locker on campus (law student) for when I am unexpectedly stuck there and not able to go home for a meal.It's quick, easy, low in calories and pretty cheap. so all in all it's a good value but I don't think it will be a staple in my pantry."
3,comfort food,"this food honestly isn't that great but i like it. the broth is pretty good but the noodles and chicken shreds taste like the dried food that it is. but still convenient, low fat"
5,"Lipton Cup A Soup, Spring Vegetable.4 oz","This is one of my Favorite cup of soup choices, but it is never carried in any of the stores in my area.So glad i could order itfrom Amazon.com. I recently moved to FL from CT and have been craving this product and now I can enjoy it to my hearts content. It has a wonderful flavor and goes so well with my cracker and cheese combo. I would recommend it to everyone. It's resonably priced and each box contains 4-4oz packages which yield a nice hot cut of soup. It travels well and can easily be made in the Microwave Oven at home, work or away on vacation."
3,soup,The shipping was fast and arrived as expected. The soup however is somewhat bland. Where's the veggies! It is good however for a mid day snack. I didn't expect much from a instant cup of soup and thats what I got!
2,tastes like chemicals,"I realize that I am saying Cup O Soup tastes like chemicals - seems obvious, but I really like the regular chicken soup and the spring vegetable. Just pass on this one."
2,Not many good things you can say about this soup,"1. Package is too small - if I compare a package to a tea bag, then you need 2 packs to make one cup of soup for a light snack (for the record, I am not even a big eater)2. Taste wise, it is a so-soI do not think I will be buying this again"
2,Salty Soup,"To much salt, can't drink the broth. Most consumers are looking to get away from this old idea for creating flavor. I'll look at it again in a couple years."
5,My go-to when dieting,"I order the ring vegetable, a case at a time, when I'm on a diet. I boost it with about a half cup of frozen mixed veggies (thaw or nuke) and then add soup/boiling water. Great to cut hunger pangs. Gotta watch the sodium, but... I love this stuff."
2,WEAK AND WATERY,"I usually like Lipton products, but Cup-a-Soup isn't one of them. It's very weak. In order for this soup to make you feel like you've eaten anything at all, you need to put at least 2 oz. less water in the cup than is called for on the box. If you put in what is recommended, you are basically drinking hot water with a very mild soup taste and trying to eat the few little noodles that are floating around. If someone wants a really quick fix, I suppose this would suffice, but not by much."
5,Lipton Cup-a-soup - Quick and easy,I like all the liption Cup-A-Soups. I have a Keurig at my desk and use it to heat my water for the soup. No need to wait around on the office microwave. Can't find these in most stores and when you do it's much more expensive. I have at least one of these a day. Bought 3 cases.
3,Good soup,"This soup is good, but not the best I've ever had. If you're not feeling well, it's great to drink and light on the stomach. A good filler in between meals and good with sandwiches."
2,VERY TASTY,THIS IS SO TASTY BUT HAS WAY TOO MUCH SODIUM FOR ME. NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE ON LOW SODIUM DIET.
3,Interesting - with reservations,"This book presents a valuable record of the relationship at the top of the two more coordinated Axis powers, a record that is otherwise not much available or featured in works in English. It is particularly noteworthy for access to the writings of Rahn, the German Plenipotentiary in Italy, and Anfuso, the Italian Ambassador to Berlin. However. it is monotnously dreary in its excessive recounting of the decline of the Salo Republic that succeeded to the nominal rule of Northern Italy after Mussolini's ouster by the Fascist Supreme Council. Moreover, the writing itself is often shockingly obtuse, especially for a man of Deakin's background, and could well have benefited from better editorship."
3,Dark Room (and Disturbing),"Following the example set in ""The Sculptress,"" Ms. Walters has crafted yet another thriller that leaves the question in your mind: did they nab the right person? Without the cut-and-dry ending of the typical mystery, Ms. Walters lends a markedly modern flavor to this genre by suggesting widespread corruption throughout our institutions, and therefore, the morality of ourselves and others."
4,Another good read from Walters,"A satisfying psychological mystery from one of the best practitioners in the field, but not up to the level of The Ice House or The Sculptress. It was interesting and readable from the first page to the last; however, some of Walter's insights into the main characters were not as astute as I've come to expect of her. Although many of her comments about how memory and amnesia work were accurate, there were aspects of the main character's symptoms that did not work. I can't say more without revealing plot twists. Just read and enjoy with a small grain of salt."
3,Clever psychological mystery writer falters with her story.,"Having read THE SCULPTRESS, I found this effort by Walters less satisfying. While the character of Jinx is fascinating and full of possibilities, and the perspectives of her therapist and various policepersons is cleverly depicted, with all its intricacies Walters comes up with a resolution that reveals nothing much, and a journey for Jinx that is sentimental in its shallowness. Walters is superb in her construction, in leading her reader - me at least - up all sorts of alleyways of possibilities, into all kinds of corners of personality. But it does not, finally, add up to anything. Which is what I expect from the best of our mystery writers: the P.D. James's, Mosleys, etc. This effort, so dependent on psychological intricacies, demands a resolution that brings insight, that challenges our presumptions. Here, for Walters, none of that is accomplished."
3,I really liked some of it,"There were parts of this book that I thought were excellently written, paced perfectly and held my interest throughout all the distractions around me. Then, there were some other parts that I thought were too slow, mostly repetitive and almost made me wonder if the author had amnesia and she forgot what she had written earlier in the story. For the most part I thought the characters were pretty good, and I did finish this book without a huge struggle, I just thought it didn't quite meet my expectations. Amazing author, not really an amazing book in my opinion. Still pretty good though."
3,Thrift store find,"I picked this up at my local thrift store for 50 cents. The book was enticing enough that I chose it for my weekend read. It is written by a British lady, Minette Walters, and set overseas. I had a little trouble with the British terminology. The plot was good but somewhat redundant and the book would have been better 100 pages shorter. I wanted to finish it but when I was done it went to the book shelf at work NOT my keeper one at home. Overall I rated it 3 stars. It was JUST ok."
2,Way too long and repetitive,"I was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book. After that it seemed that little new information was added, or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition. There were so many different characters, and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news. The structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on TV."
3,The Dark Room - Minette Walters,"While her style is gripping, her female characters very strong, and romance is kept to a minimum, I am also glad that this was not my first exposure to Ms.Walters. I found the ending rather too convoluted and was therefore unsatisfied. Pity, because I was gripped throughout, and only wish the ending came together better."
4,Tina is a Rock and Roll Buddhist Goddess,"I found this book after reading an interview with Tina Turner in Enlgand in which she discussed her life and the Buddhist practice she credits with helping turning her life around, Soka Gakkai. This book is the most inspirational life-story of a living person I've ever read!I've since re-read this book a few times, as well as other books that are related to the Buddhism she mentions in the text. At first, it was hard for me to believe someone like Tina could also be a Buddhist, but now that I've read more about it I completely understand.I'm so glad Tina mentioned in the interview about Daisaku Ikeda, the leader of Soka Gakkai and a prolific Buddhist author as well. I also found a wonderful book about this Buddhism at Amazon which I highly recommend - it's called ""The Buddha in Daily Life"" by Richard Causton.Tina is the greatest! A true rock and roll Buddhist Goddess! Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo..."
3,Okay!,"Cover has a coffee stain on it. Book has odd stinch to it, but pages are okay. Can't complain though the book is 25 years old and out of print!"
1,Overwritten! Sorely disappointed.,"I was very excited to read this book after it came highly recommended by a friend. Unfortunately, it was such an irritating read that I didn't get past page 30!The author's excessively descriptive prose is laden with big words and tough to trudge through. Coupled with erratic blurbs from Tina et. al., it's annoying to read at best.Tine has a great story to tell; she simply chose the wrong person to write it."
4,Book and delivery of book order,"Delivey was prompt, and item ordered was in excellent condition. The book was an excellent read, and led to a very interesting discussion about abuse of women. It also gave an indepth look of Tina Turner."
5,Well Worth the Read,"Tina's story of turning her life around is amazing, inspiring and uplifting for anyone. It's especially good if you're interested in the music industry, because it also shows the bad and the good of everyday life as an artist. Ultimately though, it's a story about joy and struggle and the power to take your life into your own hands and make it what you want. In that respect, Tina is an example to all of us."
5,Tina... you are one tough woman!,"After all these years, her story still rocks me to the bone. This is one great re-tell of her marriage with Ike, and her struggles in the music industry while being a wife and mother with her kids. Her determination to really keep herself alive and vibrant is inspiring as she discovers life's lesson's through the abuse of her husband. Her discovery of buddhism really moved me, and she is just one tough woman."
4,awkward aesthetic,"the awkwardly titled ""Songs: Ohia"" delivers a Palace-esque aesthetic while at the same time hints that the band has never heard of Palace (aka Oldham). sometimes repetitive to its disadvantage, often slipping into brilliant switches. inspired indie drumming on some tunes.... their best album to my ears."
5,outside shower,"This product arrived in a very short time, thank you. I installed it on the outside of my travel trailer with no problems and it works great. Thank you."
4,easy to install,This shower box was bought to replace the original one installed on my travel trailer so I had an opening already that matched the opening required for the new box. A container of plumbers putty and some exterior caulking was required to make this installation complete. Very simple to hook up existing water lines to the new faucet. Ready to go in around 30 minutes.
2,BORING - BORING - BORING,I really like Tatum BUT this book was sooo boring. She repeated and repeated herself. I had to force myself to finish the book. I bought her 2nd book and now i'm afraid to start it because if it's anything like her 1st one i'm really not interested..
3,A paper life,"I enjoyed this book. I found it to be very raw, very honest and very well written. It addressed all aspects of Ms. O'Neal's very troubled life, and whatever else she may or may not be, she is a survivor."
3,ok book,"I feel that the book got very monotonous throughout. However, I did see what a pig Ryan ONeal was as a father and an overall human being. Wow. It is amazing to me to see all of the self serving people in this book. They all needed a touch of reality."
2,If US Weekly Became a Self-Help Book...,"It's difficult to criticize this autobiography, seeing as how Tatum O'Neal repeatedly endured hellish experiences, came out healthy, and wrote a very earnest book to document her struggles. She offers a tantalizing glimpse into her life--from her neglectful mother to her physically and emotionally abusive father, Ryan O'Neal, to the many women in her father's life (including Farrah Fawcett and Angelica Huston), to her battles with drug addiction, to her emotionally abusive marriage to John McEnroe. At times I questioned the veracity of her claims because they were so incredibly awful, but I believe that they are true. The parts that dish on other celebrities make this a very quick, entertaining read, but the self-help stuff and seemingly endless details about McEnroe's tournament schedules drag it down a bit."
1,Horrible,"I should have felt sorry for Tatum with all that she went through as a child. But I found myself not believing most of what she said... not because I thought any of the people in her life were so great, she just does not come off as believable. Instead, she comes off as a spoiled-rotten, name-dropping brat.I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did reading this. I kept hoping there would be something redeeming in this book, but I felt absolutely nothing for her."
5,Heartbreaking and Inspiring,"Tatum is not worthless but an absolute gem! Not a coward, but absolutly couragous. Her kids love and inspire her in the end because - through it all - she is a great human being, mom, and person. I enjoyed this book...could not put it down. I wish her much success and peace in her new drug free and abusive free life. She deserves it!"
4,Hard to put down.,My sister read both books by Tatum O'Neal and recommended them to me. I am glad she did. Now I can't wait to read her latest.
3,Shocking Paper,"This is definitely a page turner. You want to know what happens next. From a highly abusive and neglectful childhood, a bizarre and lonely adolescence and a tumultuous marriage, Tatum O'Neal lives it one day at a time and keeps swinging."
4,4 stars for readability,"I rated this book 4 stars for readability. It was definitely a page-turner. Lots of inside dirt to satisfy the celebrity hound. Heartbreaking that Tatum endured so much abuse at the hands of her parents and then went on to marry her father in the form of John McEnroe, if we are to take everything she says at face value. I know that her family (Ryan, Griffin and ex John) is appalled and denies what she purports. Whether or not her history is accurate, it is kind of sad that she must've felt like she had to purloin her past to make money. Why else would one want to air their 32,000 loads of dirty laundry to the public?"
5,a paper life,this was a wonderful tell all book of a daughter longing for her father to love her and her replacing that emptiness with drug abuse. she spills all the details of every area of her life. i thought itwas written wonderfully and was an easy read. i laughed and cried through this book i was sad that it had to end. i absolutely loved it!
5,Tautology taken to a brilliant extreme,"It's particularly fitting that this autobiography was released within days of Jaques Derrida's death, as the tautological irony of an autobiographical book making a self-aware reference to its own existence as a ""paper life"" creates a new frame of reference through which to evaluate the textual context of the work. As for the work itself, it is, to use the term used by semioticians such as myself in formal papers exchanged with others in our field of study, ""freakin' awesome."""
3,"Not the best, but definitely intersting","I liked the book, thaugh i have to admit it certainly not well written."
2,I'm so depressed,"that I spent money on this book. I guess I'll just chalk it up to charity towards Ms. O'Neal.The only bit that I got from this shambled mess is: She was a great actress (a LONG time AGO - in a handful of movies.) She's a great mom (when she has custody, is not high, in rehab, or hanging out with her artist friends or personal trainers.) And, that her father is a horrible, horrible man - blamed for all of the failures in her life thus far (see ""Paper Moon II"" for future failures and blames.)PLEASE...I almost threw up in the middle of reading it, I thought it was just that bad. I must have really wanted to get my $$$s worth. Oh well. I finally simply had to laugh at the name-dropping throughout and hypocracy in it.Good luck Tantum. You certainly sound like you need it."
1,Don't bother,"I would be ashamed to be named as the editor of this so-called book. I feel as though by paying full price for this worthless diary, I have enabled Ms. O'Neal in a process of trashing her parents, one of whom can no longer speak for herself. The language is way too basic with blatant mistakes in grammer and yet, I found myself pushing onward, hoping for some redeeming value never to be found. If you're thinking about buying this, don't bother. There are too many good biographies to waste time and money on this one."
2,nut job,"This poor thing is being published when she should be being helped.Warning -- anybody who talks about ""repressed memories"" is simply not to be trusted."
5,GRIPPING AND INSPIRING - A REAL PAGE TURNER,"This book leaves a long lasting impression on the reader. It could have also been titled ""The Tragedy and the Triumph"".It is something of a ""poor little rich/famous girl"" book, but written without a real shred of self-pity. Tatum is too intelligent for that, and she is strong. You can tell that she has done a lot of work on ""righting"" what has been wrong in her life, much of it due to circumstances beyond her control. However she also freely admits her mistakes, sins of commission and ommission.I came away from this book admiring her and learning not to judge others too harshly, 'cause ya just never know what they've been through and what they come from."
5,This was a gift to a friend of mine who is recovering and thought it would interest her--she'll pick it up sometime this winter,Can't write a review--my friend will be reading it that I bought it for a gift for Christmas and she now owns it.
3,gossipy and good but true?,good gossip but questionable truthiness! She admits to being quite a casual liar many times in the book so who knows what is true and what is not. The John McEnroe stuff is true though because I read his autobiography after this one and he says all the same stuff...
2,A Little Knowledge is a Dangerous Thing....,"I liked Tatum O'Neal, the actress AND the celebrity, much better before reading this stagey confessional which seems not-too-expertly ghost written and heavy on the name-dropping and ""Daddy Dearest"" appeal of showbiz tomes.Not that it isn't interesting...great airplane or beach fare. However, I'm sure it's meant to be more of an eye-opening look at familial addiction amidst the jungles of Tinseltown. It just comes off as phony and uninspiring, though many of my fellow amazon reviewers appear to disagree. This pretty, talented lady would be much better off walking the walk, it seems to me, than talking the talk and slamming other people in the process. But that doesn't always sell books."
2,"review the book, not her life","Yes, she did have a troubled, heartbreaking and even abusive childhood, no question about that. The book itself, though, is thin and prattling, with nearly everything being ""told"" and not ""shown."" If her name weren't famous, this would never have been printed."
1,A paper life,To me listening to her stories everything was and is everyone elses fault. Take the blame for your own mistakes after you've grown up.
2,tired formlua,"I bought this book because of the glowing reviews on this site, and most of the time that is a good bet. But, this time it was not. This book is not very romantic, nor interesting. The two main characters, Cecilia and Lord Delacourt, were not well developed, I am not sure even what they looked like, except for her breast size, and his handsomeness. There are many minor characters in the book that are more interesting than the main ones. The plot revolves around a mystery of some prostitutes getting murdered. In the end you don't really care who did it, nor do you through out the book. If not for the infrequent romantic moments the book would have been a total yawn. I barely finished it."
4,A Fast-Paced Read,"This book did what many Regencies fail to do: Stay true to the characters, the era, the romance, AND the mystery. All the characters are interesting. I have to admit, reluctantly, that I was fooled by who the villain was. The love scenes were steamy and not too long, that just slows the book down for me. Many characters that star in other books of LC's are featured in this one. Try it, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,Earlier Liz is great as well.....,I really enjoy this author so I decided to go back and read her earlier work. A Woman of Virtue is a fun historical romance of two people who pretend to hate each other. They are pushed together to solve a mystery and solve an old desire. Off to read more ....
4,New author I'll be reading more of,This was my first Liz Caryle book and was not disappointed. I really enjoyed the characters. They were smart and funny. This was a really good read.
4,"A slow start, but worth it!","This book has been sitting on my TBR pile for a long, long time. After reading page 136, I was wonder why the heck I was still reading this book, it was going S-L-O-W. Some people have a 50 or 100 page rule, but I've always read every book that I have picked up, and did I really want to implement this 50 or 100 page rule? Anyways, I continued on and the book FINALLY started picking up! I did not have to give the book the DNF tag - but I digress.When the book picked up it was sweet and sensual with a mystery to solve. I did enjoy this book, don't get me wrong, the second half of the book more than makes up for the slow start. The hero, David, was a great character- most delightful in this ""reunited"" couple synopsis. His words were poetic and jumped off the pages. I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another book by Liz Carlyle."
5,The One Book To Read,"Next to the Bible I recommend this book, especially for African Americans.If you want insight into the psychosis that many black people are suffering from you have to read this book. The old saying that ""what you don't know can't hurt"" is a lie. Truly people are dying for a lack of knowledge. I can't recommend this book more!"
4,Uncharted territory,"This book really told a story and showed us how and why things are as they are for black people who are descended from slaves,how those old terrible ties still bind today in ways that are sad yet compelling."
5,Kirkbride NASB,"The quality of this Bible is very good, the translation is absolutely the best. I own all the translations my personal favorites have grown by one now!"
5,Fantastic Read,"I ran across this book at my local library. Turns out it was a first edition, 1962. I've shared a pic of the cover of the book up above, it's the yellow cover.EJ Kahn does a great job of reviewing all known cases at the time (1962) of holdouts or stragglers from the Imperial Japanese army on islands in the Pacific after WWII finished. Very readable, easy to digest style. He recounts the survivors point of view and though process as to why they took so long to surrender.The last chapter of the book was about some stragglers on Lubang Island, Philippines. As it turns out, he was a bit early, thinking they were dead since no trace was found of them in 1962. In fact, the officer in the story, Hiroo Onoda, didn't surrender until 1974, as he was waiting to be relieved by a superior officer."
4,He's the man!,"My favortie song is the title cut, ""Simply"". He has a great future ahead in the country music business...needs to be heard on the radio more! This collection is filled with great love ballads."
5,Great humidor,"Such a great humidor, I got this as my first big humidor for 50 cigars and is great, very good looking with the lether on top and instruments works just fine. I curently have 2 packs of 72% Boveda and hygrometer is at 72% after only 7 days! amazing!. If you want something that simply do the job this is the one."
2,not so hot,i guess you get what you pay for.... would not hold the proper humidity but a nice looking box would not use it for cigars.....jsr
2,Not recommended -- low durability,"I normally wear 32x32 jeans, so I was pleased when my 32x32 Dubliners fit perfectly. The styling was not as dramatic as in the pictures, and this also pleased me. My only complaint regarding the fit or looks is that the flare is a bit large. It's not too bad, though.However, I have a major complaint with the durability of these jeans. The fabric is exceptionally thin; any time there is any stress on the seams, the stitches look like they're going to pop out. Plus, I wore them only once and there's already a hole in the fabric. Needless to say, I am not pleased.Pros: Fit as expected, look cool, low price.Cons: Exceptionally thin fabric, low durability.Conclusion: These jeans aren't worth it, even for $20."
2,Handstands Jelly Sticky Pad Graphite,"I bought this product thinking it will be very useful. However it is really too small to place anything other than the cellphone. Since my car has got sufficient pockets/cup holders on doors, behind the parking break, to hold several things, I think the purchase of this product was not as useful. May be a bigger pad might be more useful.Currently I have a small statue placed on it. (since I did not want to stick anything to the car). So that worked out well.Also, in my car the pad frequently gets dirty (thanks to the fall season), it gathers dust very soon as I like to keep the windows open when I drive after which it stops sticking."
5,Really Sticky Pad,The price for this item was very good. These pads are really sticky. They work great and were shipped quickly. Highly recommended.
4,Amazing!,"I was so amazed the first time I used this - couldn't believe my cell phone stayed on it at a slight incline! The stickiness seems to have worn off some, but I think it will come back if I wash it."
3,Works OK,"It does what it says to an extent. You have to clean it about once a week because of dust in the air settling on it and removing its stickiness. once it starts to go, things slide everywhere. The good news is drop it in the sink and wash it with dishsoap and it's ready to go."
1,Stickless Pad,This is a complete waste of money. I'd like mine back. Works so so for a short time but then it just doesn't have the sticking power. Even when cleaned. My small MP player launches in many turns my Galaxy S3 flies even further. Garbage. The old open holed mats that could be cut to fit worked much better. Even in off road driving. The Sticky can't even handle city streets.
1,Only a Jelly Pad,"My husband had a dashboard sticky pad (not from handstands) that holds his cell phone or GPS. He can even put it in the middle of his steering column and it stays on. I bought these sticky pads because of the reviews I read. Since my husband loves his so much, I thought I would buy one for the rest of the family. I ordered 6. Unfortunately, there is no sticky, just a jelly pad. It would not stick to my dash by itself much less hold my phone. The only thing this pad can do is sit on top of your dash and keep things from sliding around. I wanted it to stick to my dash and hold my phone so I could view my phone screen. I called the company and they were really nice and sent me some other types of sticky pads but I had the same result. I sent them all back, but was not refunded my full amount."
1,Not really good enough,"The Day of the Jackal remains Forsyth's best and Icon his worst. Apart from the appalling number of typos in my hard back copy the writing seemed tired and amateurish. The introduction of the bizarre Council of Lincoln almost had me discarding the book. The idea that a meeting could be arranged between Lord Carrington, Margaret Thatcher, Elliot Richardson, George Bush, Henry Kissinger even in a spy thriller felt a schoolboy creation to me. Aside from the odious product likely to issue from such an awful group, even in fiction.Overall Forsyth has made Le Carre's worst look brilliant with this effort (sic)."
5,Great spine tingler,"I couldn't put this book down until I had finished. The places, dates and events brought History alive for me. Even the future events were vivid and realistic. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Forsyth's works. I give this work my highest recomendation. Read it, you'll like it, just as I did."
1,Icon by F. Forsyth.,"Haven't finished it yet, though the start is good I have enjoyed everything of Frederick Forsyth's so far, and think I have read them all."
4,icon,"As usual the book is well written with a back drop of knowledge in the setting, creating a reasonance that makes one of the best reads."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Ultra-right Russian problem.US and British intelligence uncover details about what the likely future head of Russia is going to get up to if he gains power, and it isn't pretty, and perhaps a little bit prophetic.Not being to do anything about it through official channels, a group of influential westerners, including an ex-intelligence chief seen in a previous book try and work out what they can do about it, before it is too late - as this man is brutally removing all their sources at hand.They hit upon the man they think is right for the job, and convince him to get to work.Certainly not one of his best."
3,Icon has all the suspense of staring at a statue,"Written more as a historical document of the end of the Cold War between Russia, and the U.S., and England, Icon just plods along.Though well written, the characters have no personality, the story, no life, and all the suspense of watching a block of ice melt.Read instead, his;1. Day of the Jackal2. Odessa File3. Negotiator4. Fourth ProtocolAll of these are much more exciting books by Forsyth, and highly recommended."
2,DROPPED THE BALL,"Forsyth droped the ball in this book. THe proof of this fact is that he wrote, after this book and after a long time, a book about a different genre that he's used to (PHANTOM of THe Opera. This book is much worse than ""FIST OF GOD"". The main character, Jason Monk, wracks havov in Russia with extreme facility, make ""contacts"" even in a easier way, and resolve all the problems of Russia almost single-handed. As always, the characters act like robots without personality, but this isnot the poin, because this is one of Forsyth's ingredients to success. The history is weak, that's all."
3,A Disappointment!,"As an ardent reader of Forsyth's novels,Icon was a big let down for me.The idea of a single man uncovering a sinister plot to revive the holocaustis simply impossible.Although the climax is gripping,especially with regards to the source of information(the priest),the end is a bit too simplistic.I think Forsyth wanted his last book to end with a ""Alls well that ends well"" kind of feeling,which is just an explanation,not an excuse.At the end,I would categorise this book as another average product,but alas from a great author."
2,Strange sense of Deja Vu,Though I like most of what Forsyth writes but this is definitely one of the books where Mr. Forsyth looks out of his touch a bit. The research as usual is brilliant but the Russian characters sounds very similar to the Devil's Advocate's character.The tone of the book is kind of slow and sluggish until Jason Monk takes over the main stage. All in all Mr. Forsyth doesnt traverse any unchartered territory. The plot and characters sound similar to his earlier books. Read it because the twists and turns in the end are neat or like for me I cant resist a Forsyth book but do not expect Jackal...
2,WEAK BY FORSYTH'S STANDARDS,"ANy real Forsyth fan knows this is his worst book. But a bad book by Forsyth still is a good reading, due to this genius'capacity. Anyway, the main trouble is that character Jason Monk is totally unconvincing."
3,"Good story, but too confusing","Forsyth's premise is a very interesting story; it reminds me much of Ludlum. It opens with intriguing what-if history then keeps flipping back and forth through time. The time log is really screwed, but hey, it is suspenseful."
4,"Good read, but has its flaws","Well, this book has everything in it that one expects from a good spy-novel: Espionage and counter-espionage, the killing of traitors and a cleverly constructed plot. But it has its share of weaknesses. Let me explain: While the plot is cleverly constructed, the dramatic strcuture of the novel isn't: The flashbacks in part one slow down the proceedings FAR too much and then, the ending is much too short and comes to quick. To show why I didn't give this book a higher rating, I have to compare it to his last book, THE FIST OF GOD (TFOG): The Baghdad in that novel was much more alive and before my eyes than the Moscow in this book, TFOG had a much faster pace and it had more characters you care for. There is a strange air of detachment in this novel. While I really crossed my fingers that the guy in Baghdad (in TFOG) made it out alive, I didn't care that much for this Jason Monk here. Worth your time, but maybe not what you expect from a man with the reputation of Forsyth"
4,Suspense builds like a rollercoaster,"This Forsyth novel starts rather slowly but then takes off like a literary rollercoaster. No simple plot here; this story of how a cabal thwarts the election of a Russian despot-to-be, spearheaded by a former CIA master spy, is intricately plotted but doesn't lose the reader in a jumble of story lines. Obviously well researched, the background information is richly detailed in a way that enhances the story without bogging it down. Definitely a good read (and I see miniseries potential)."
4,Thrilling view of a possible future Russia.,Thrilling and very detailed work. Easy read. Very cloak and dagger/james bond style of adventure. Good language(no swearing). Characters are very plausable and add to the suspence of the story. Wonderful history of Russia and its quest of a unified nation without Communism.
5,Excellent product; love FX Schmid!,"It was nice to see uniform-sized/shaped pieces, instead of odd, weird shapes! the quality was absolutely excellent. I would definitely order more FXSchmids, if they were 500 pieces or less."
1,You cannot customize the postage amount,"I hoped to use this software for my wedding invitations, but the amount of postage I needed (97 cents for a 2oz. square envelope) was not in their drop-down list of choices and you cannot set your own postage amount. Part of the reason for buying this software would be to create stamps with unusual postage amounts, but it does not allow for that sort of customization."
5,Very pleased!,"I put a photo of my ""All American"" tiger tabby on a stamp and it came out very good and I got a lot of response on it. I am going to do the same for my Christmas cards by putting the church altar decorated for Christmas on the stamp."
1,Please do not buy this product,"I bought 20 sheet of stamps from photostamps.com, The image of my stamps came out too dark so I returned the stamps. Per Photostamps.com website they will issue credit if you return it in 30days. However I did not get credit in my account after sending back the stamps. Their customer service told me that they will send me credit but they never did. I got same answer every time but never got my money back. I am very frustrated and eventually just gave up."
2,Doesn't always work with IE9 and it requires IE.,"Have been a customer of theirs for years, and have had a series of software compatability issues, but this last one, as of Mar 2011 is a real kicker . . after I upgraded from IE8 to IE9 (win7 64bit OR 32bit, I tried both) their software stopped working . . after a series of their folks worked with me and their own testing couldn't reproduce the problem, they basically said, ""yr on yr own,"" instead of spending more time with me to isolate the issue, so that OTHER customers don't have the same problem . . I canceled . . . buggy UI, not enough resolve when the problem isn't immediately apparent to their support folks.They have had other similar problem solving technique when in a previous version, they stopped being able to print international labels, I give up . . USPS does the same thing for free and doesn't cost $16 a month."
1,Why pay for the software???,"I'd give this no stars but it won't let me.Why would anyone buy this? I was in Compusa today as they are closing down on Long Island & thought about buying this. I put it down & said I will researh this more at home. As I suspected, you can go to [...] & do the same thing that this software does. The software doesn't allow you to print stamps at home so what's the point? The only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps, so it's like buying a [...] coupon, that's a one time use. I don't get it?"
1,Very Dissapointed,I wish I had payed more attention when I ordered this book and noticed that it was written by Richard Carlson's Editors instead of himself. The advice in this book is no different than you read in any magazine on any given month from the grocery store.I really like Richard Carlson's books from earlier days. I guess he has made to money now to write them himself.
3,sharp,"This item arrived promptly and packaged well. As for its usefulness in sharpening knives and scissors, it takes three times to sharpen them with this product to be somewhat effective. The handy, fold-away design is great for easy and safe storage. A sharpening stone is much more effective. Unfortunately, it is difficult to locate one."
4,Not a professional,"I am not a professional body builder, or a competitive athlete, I just like to be in shape. Over all the product works very well for me, it keeps my protein and carbohydrates levels. Many times after working out I would feel very hungry and craving dairy, even the morning after the workout. Since I tried this I feel satisfied and healthy, but as I said I am not a professional, nor a heath worker, so try it for your self."
2,Slow and lots of errors,"Hmm, when I first got this program it worked fine which made me happy, but now it often crashes or just hangs midway through a burn. The lack of speed also started to irritate me. I'm glad I got it for free after Amazon's mail-in rebate (OK, I have yet to get the check...).I've heard that DVD X Copy Xpress can fit *any* DVD movies into one DVD-R or -RW disc. Of course, owning that program has some legal issues that may come to bite you someday if RIAA decides to subpoena the names of people who bought it (and its cousin programs DVD X Copy, etc.) like they are doing with p2p file sharing right now."
1,Instant Copy Anything,"I buy this software expecting that solve a basic need, Copy DVD and CD, only for my personal use (backup), when I see it, thinks, look good... But.... Oh deception, this software don't copy anything!!!!!!, any DVD, any CD, any with a copyright, on resume, anything... Is better never buy it...If the 99.9% of the comercial software that comes on CD or DVD have copyright, means that this software can copy only the 0.1% of the existing software.... And for that any software to copy cd's can do it.Dont take the risk, is better never buy it!."
1,I don't see why this is better then what I already have,I have some free program that can do more then this program.I already have CD/DVD software that came with my burner drive.
3,Not good enough,"This software is OK for backing up DVDs although it is slow, but if you want to convert DVD video to SVCD (maybe VCD too), most of the time the video and audio will be out of sync. This is painful especially considering it usually takes about 4 to 6 hours on a 1.8Ghz computer to get it converted and you finally find the output is useless.Another issue is, depends on whether you care or not, after dual-layer DVD video is compressed into one DVD, the closed caption (not the subtitle) is gone.Finally, the support is bad. It is very slow for the company to come out with a patch/fix, and the software is still pretty buggy now."
1,Junk Junk Junk,"ver 7.0No, this will not copy copyrighted DVDs. Pinnacle is well knowen for their infearior software. After reasearching this software, it seems to be a rework of a German developers software (I think its called Vob copy) Pinnacle was cheaper than the german ware, so I bought Pinnacle to own a disk and not download of the net. This is very buggy and hit and miss. It does not reconize my external Sony DVD burner half the time. And must reboot the computer a few times. This will happen after succesfull burning a DVD, I will have to reboot. I download the latest list of DVD burners and this did not help the problem.Next I download the newest and greatest version 8. Now I am not having a hit or miss problem, It is just miss. Does not work at all.One thing everyone can count on is Pinnacle dependablity.They have releast another undependable buggy product.What makes me mad is, I knew better than to buy it."
1,"Will NOT copy ""copy protected"" DVD videos","It's true this software will copy dual layered DVD's on to a 4.7g DVD-+R/-+RW, but unfortunate it will NOT copy ""copy protected"" DVD videos. ""Copy protected"" DVD is nothing but a DVD with the ""copyright"" flag enable. 99.9% of the DVDs in your local blockbuster is ""copyright"" aka ""copyprotected.""Not that it's impossible to copy those ""copy protected"" DVD, but Pinnacle systems has such a reputation, they will definitely not break the rule and let you copy those DVDs on their software."
1,Big Waste Of Money!,"This is garbage. Don't buy this. It can't copy any DVD. Not even a DVD out of a cereal box. And try getting support for it, HA HA. GOOD LUCK. They give you a number, that takes you to another number, that takes you to another number that hangs up on you. buy ""DVD X COPY"""
1,What a waste of money,"This program is not properly advertised. It WILL NOT make copies of your DVD Movies, since most movies are copy protected. In order to use this program, you must download a program to remove the copy protection, rip the dvd to your hard drive (you must have a ton of hard drive space to rip the entire disk to your hard drive. See vcdhelp.com for more info) and then copy from your hard drive to the dvd. There are free programs that do this same thing and are really no harder than using this program. It's a shame, because I have used many Pinnacle products, but this just doesn't deliver, since most commercial DVD's are copy protected."
5,You must know how to use this program!!!,"This software is excellent. But first, you must use dvd decrypter (a free software) so you can copy your dvd to the hard drive first (even the copyrighted for backup purposes, remember that it's illegal to sell copies of copy right material). When using DVD Decrypter, choose to decrypt all files. Then use instant copy to burn the DVD, be sure to use the ""customized resize"" in the Copy Method of the DVD Menu, so you can take off the extra features (like subtitles, or second audio tracks...) to improve the video quality. You can actually copy all the DVD but because you're copying from a 9.4gb dvd to a 4.7gb, the image loses resolution (shrinkage process), so it's up to you, if you want all the extras or sacrifice them for a better picture. You can see the percentage of the imgae that will be kept! DVD X Copy splits the movie into 2 DVDs!It has never crashed, and it takes like 40 minutes to burn a DVD!"
1,Much too slow. Faster programs are free!,"Boy, was this a disappointment. It takes forever. And it's not like I have an obsolete machine (Pentium 4, 1.7). Worst of all: Right after I bought this I found DVD Shrink, which does more or less what Instant Copy does, plus it rips to your hard drive, and it's a lot a faster, and its totally free! My advice: Go with the free stuff like DVD Shrink."
2,"quality output, but crummy software","I had problems with the software going crazy on me once in a while (no real support for it either). Forget copyrighted DVD backups, but at least there's no annoying DVD XCopy-style splash screen. Not good for much as DVD Shrink does more, is more versatile and puts out the same quality compression as far as I can see. Glad I got this free after rebate."
4,"Not ""that"" Scott Thompson","I found this enjoyable book by accident. I searched for books by ""Scott Thompson"" of ""Kids in the Hall"" fame, but I happened upon this little jewel. (It's not ""that"" Scott Thompson, but it's still a Scott Thompson I'd like to meet and call a friend!) At first I was a little worried. The title made me think I was going to be in for PFD humor...sort of like the Queens of Comedy (No, again, not Scott Thompson). This book is filled with good humor ideas that you can use as your own without giving credit to the author. Plus, it's not a very popular book, so no one will ever catch you. I had my friends in stiches with props I made by stitching. Literally! This book doesn't guarantee you'll become a college favorite like Carrot Top, but it won't hurt. A must have for any do-it yourselfer or amateur prop comedian."
2,Misnamed Title?!,"This title is misnamed. There are no suggestions in here on where to deduct your union dues. This is more of Wade's asset protection strategies that he teaches in his seminars. Why is a cabdriver talking about taxes? Some professionals spend their entire careers working with, studying, and researching taxes. A cabdriver thinks Section 179 on asset expensing is a secret. All the tax professionals know about this advantage. A cabdriver wants to sell you on his seminars, tapes, Nevada corporations, internet service, etc. All the Wade Cook information is the same repackaged in a new format. It makes interesting reading, but follow your local professional's advice."
1,CAUTION,"Before you read Wade Cook's book, be sure to read about his bankruptcy in 2004. Just enter his name on Google and you will see more news articles about it than you could find time to read!It was publicized around here, but people in other parts of the country may not have heard about it."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"Check it out at the library first (it will be there - this guy is the greatest self promoter of the 90s!) before you spend any money. What a tremendous amount of fluff. I feel incredibly dumb for buying such a clearly self-published, amateur hour book for so much money!"
1,Deduct $$$$ from your wallet.,"This is another piece of self-promotion and inaccurate information delivered by Wade. Avoid attorneys and CPAs, just let us set you up as a Nevada Corp. Wow, that tactic is getting people sued by their state revenue departments for income tax evasion. Check it out!!Set yourself up as a corporation. Good that way you can pay corporate income taxes and then personal taxes. Oh, but what about protection from lawsuits? There is a concept Mr. Cook missed called ""Piercing the Corporate Veil"" Check it out!!What about business deductions? Spend a $1 to save .25 cents in taxes. Hmmm. And if you don't have a ""Profit Motive"" and a ""Profit"" you get 0, plus you spent a $1. Check it out!!There are some LEGITIMATE tax guides on the market such as JK LASSER and ERNST and YOUNG. Not only are they cheaper, the advice is sound and they contain credible references."
4,"An excellent ""awareness"" book!","""Brillant Deductions"" makes people aware that you have the ability to take control of many broadbased pitfalls such as taxes, liabilities, and probate. It offers strategies that reduces risk in all these areas. Like anything else, seek advise from professionals before pursuing any strategy."
4,Murph's comments,"The art work was outstanding. My wife grew up in Rahway and knew some of the characters, the depiction of whom was accurate in both text and illlustration. It was an interesting story of the trials of a teenager in the late 40's."
3,Fast turn signal,The only problem i have with these lights is at night my turn signals bink very fast. This only happens when the lights on my Esclade are on. Binks normal when the lights are off.
3,A Guilty Pleasure,"H.P. Lovecraft posthumously owes a great debt to August Derleth. Derleth is responsible for the fact that Lovecraft's work is still available today. Derleth created a publishing house to help keep this work in print. Derleth also attempted to continue Lovecraft's tradition of horror by writing new tales himself, many created from one or two sentences of Lovecraft's. Derleth's reputation as a writer has suffered (deservedly) from this. The present book builds on some of Lovecraft's concepts. However, where other works of Derleth's are the worst sort of hack work, I actually found this book to be both fun and interesting. This book would never be considered literary in the way Lovecraft's work is, but it is a fun read for fans of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos."
3,Nike Arm Band,"Comfortable and the ipod won't come loose when running, but it runs a little big if you have smallish arms. The ipod needs to come out of the sleeve to to recharge. I found this bothersome."
3,Nike arm band,"Great product, but would be alot better if arm band was a closed loop. The open straps are not as convenyent to place as the straps that slip over hand, up arm, and then tighten with velcro."
4,Window a big improvement; Nike+ adapter still doesn't fit great,"I can't believe how hard it is to find an armband for the ipod nano that accommodates the Nike+ adaptor!! This is one of only three ipod nano armbands I've been able to find that works with the Nike+ system. (the others are from Active Sport and Sportsuit Relay by Marware, which I think is the best one). Most armbands don't allow use of the Nike+ system.Nike has done a good job with improving this armband, but it is still difficult to get the iPod with the adaptor all the way into the pouch, and then you have to take out the ipod each time you want to download your run. (This is one reason why the Marware product is better). I'm considering cutting a slit in the bottom so that I can leave the ipod in the sleeve and just take out the adaptor to download or plug in the ipod.Otherwise, it's comfortable and fits well on my upper arm. I was given this armband as a gift so I guess I will try it out. We'll see how long it lasts!"
4,An improvement...,"...over the previous version with no window, but still some guesswork in navigating the click-wheel."
2,Band doesn't stay put,"I've tried this several ways, on upper and lower arm, neither of which is very usable, but it you're not running - or skating it might be useful. With more vigorous movement, I found it slipped."
4,could be better designed,Great idea however it didn't work well while running. The window fogged up & it was difficult to control the nano through the fabric. Could be better designed.
4,Overall good product,"Armband is comfortable and great for long runs. I greatly prefer this design to previous ones I have owned with bulky and easily broken plastic clips/parts. The only negative I have noted is that it doesn't perfectly line up with my iPod 4G. However, this isn't a big deal for me as I can easily find the buttons I need (play, pause, fast forward) with a quick feel while running. I should also point out that it is really difficult to change the volume on this while running, but I have owned several different armbands over the years and have never had one in which this wasn't the case. Overall, I think this is a quality product and would recommend it to friends."
3,Not the best,The item arrived within the posted time and works pretty much as intended. However the product itself is not ideal for the new ipods and doesn't really work as well as I'd like it to. Also if you want to use the Nike + then this is not the ideal product for it.
3,awkward size,"It is very long and large. It may work great for BBQ, but not at my kitchen cooking stove. It may be a good product (at least the cast iron part) but regular sliced bread doesn't fit in it. The handles are screwed in the cast iron parts and don't seem to be robust enough. So, I kept this tool in a storage for future bbq. I can make good panini using 2 cast iron skillet at a cooking stove."
2,Cumbersome,"I love panini. This does make a good sandwich but it is awkward to use. It would work great on the grill or over a fire when the long handles would be a good thing. On the stove in the kitchen, they are too long. I would not recommend this."
1,Deadest,"This series is officially dead. Without Barker's guidance, without the Cenobites, & without Pinhead's diabolical philosophies then all the subplots become exposed for what they truly are: inane, unimaginative attempts at horror. It's time for Hellraiser to remain in ""The Box"", and past time for it to be buried."
1,Boobs and blood?@$?,"By far, one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. It starts off promisingly enough with some interesting story points and editing, but soon deteriorates. Some of the makeup is good, but pinhead and all of the other cenobites don't make an apearance until the end! When they do, it feels tacked on and does not connect with what has happened up til that point. Although, what has happened is a quandry. The story derails after the first 30 mins. and after that all you get is boobs and blood with no pupose. The ending scene is a direct rip of ""Jesus wept"" from the original Hellraiser, but done poorly. Clive Barker is certainly in hiding after the release of this piece of repetitive trash."
2,Part VII,"I suppose the interesting thing about all the Hellraiser films is that they are quite different from eachother.This seventh installment honors that assessment, but the fact that it's different stems from the main plot not originally being based on the Hellraiser mythos.Instead, a stand-alone horror story was written, and then Hellraiser was inserted in.Unfortunately, this has left the Hellraiser connection making no sense whatsoever.While the acting and cinematography are good, I can't really say the interest and enjoyment level matches.Give parts one to six a try, but if you want a Hellraiser film, look elsewhere."
4,Goth Thriller,"Im a huge Hellraiser fan, and I like the movie. It was really goth and underground. Only complaint is that, like the previous few Hellraiser only appears for about a total of 5 minutes. He is not up to the usual intellectual profound speeches, so the proverbal statements are really missing. Found it exciting though and worth the purchase."
4,One of the best in the series.,"Hellraiser: Deader continues to take the franchise in the direction that Hellseeker did, with a darker tale of morality that Clive Barker had intended for the series. Strong story, strong visuals, strong cast. One of the best horror movies to come out this year.The scare filled plot is full of twists and turns while continuing to expand on Barker's mythology with some nice inside winks to longtime fans.True Hellraiser fans will put this in their top three along with Hellraiser and Hellbound followed closely by Hellseeker.Fans of the cheesier Hellraiser 3 & 4 may be dissappointed in less Pinhead, but less definitely is more in this latest installment given 3 out of four stars from Fangoria Magazine."
5,Short film - No More Souls (Bonus on Hellraiser: Deader),"See the final Hellraiser movie chapter (No, Not Hellraiser: Hellworld or Hellraiser: Bloodline)short film - ""No More Souls"" (Hidden on Hellraiser:Deader)Go to the second page of the special features- Highlight ""Play Movie""- Hit down- Hit right, it will auto select Merchant's box on the right side of the screen and then the short will playYour Welcome. :)"
4,Great episode!,After the first 3 or 4 Hellraiser movies they've taken to producing nice little horror films that are more about clever horror than big special effects horror .The stories are interesting and the acting very good.This one is no exception .Only problem i have is trying to figure out exactly why the toymaker's descendent wants to go to hell.I hope they keep making these films for yrs to come.I don't have to see Pinhead and half a dozen cenobites kill 300 people to enjoy the concept of the Box bringing about the downfall of thrillseekers.
1,WOW DID THIS MOVIE SUCK!!!!,I love the Hellraiser series so I was very angry and disappointed with this movie. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and thats saying alot (Basket case!). I did not rent this movie but went out and bought it for $ 26.00. I have learned my lesson always rent then if you like it buy it do not judge something because it comes from a long line of great movies or books.
2,"Not what I expected, the ending is drab","I love hellraiser 1 and inferno, hellraiser 2 is o.k. but some of it got kind of confused, not that I was confused but the picture seemed to be that way. In Hellraiser Deader, I found it to be a yaaaan at certain times, the only uppside to this picture was pinhead himself. The story line seems rushed and thrown together, the only hellraiser worse than this one is hellraiser, hellworld."
2,Sad sad sad,"Obviously the writer was impressed with American Werewolf inLondon. Sadly, he wasn't as talented.Its a pity what boring nonsense we have to sit throughto get a few minutes of Pinhead. Its a very very few minutesof him to be sure. My advice--rent it and fast forward tothe Pinhead bits."
2,Not So Hot,"This seventh entry in the Hellraiser series is, as expected, a rather shabby piece of film. It feels disjointed and contrived...possibly related to rumors I've heard of patchwork scripting. It's slow, badly written, and boring overall, with a painfully low-budget feel to it. It definitely doesn't bring anything new to the game. Avoid it, save yourself some time!"
3,Another Interesting chapter in the Hellraiser Legacy,"Hellraiser Deader is an interesting chapter in that it was at first not even a Hellraiser story. The plot line is that a young journalist is investigating a cult phenomenon known as the Deaders, where a person seemingly kills themselves only to be ressurected. As she journeys through the seedy underworld (is there really any other kind) she discovers bits and pieces of the Deaders as well as the infamouse box.Once again Pinhead and crew take a backseat to the overall story which in this case is good (although Inferno was by far the best of the sequel lot so far) as they really are only there to wreak vengeance on those tampering with the fabric of the unknown once more. As a hellraiser movie it's not much, but as a movie in general it's alright."
3,Not as bad as you might think.,"If you are waiting for the Hellraiser series to ever return to its original form stop waiting. It's never going to happen. The Hellraiser series was taken in a refreshingly new direction years ago where Pinhead is NOT the main character of the story.As for this movie, it's quite enjoyable considering it is the 7th in the series. There is some great gore, horror, characters, etc.My only complaint is the plot. Well, to be exact, little is done to explain these ""Deader"" people and how they are connected to Pinhead. There are enough contextual clues that can help the viewer imagine for him/herself what is really going on, but i think most peopel who see a movie prefer a clear cut explanation.If you liked the last two Hellraisers, this one should be enjoyable too."
3,really not a bad movie,"I personal always felt direct to dvd movies were all crapy. Well folks it true, but on this film and other hellraiser hellworld. These were good movies and even wroth full price. I enjoy them, but also felt the remake of halloween suck. So keep that in mind folks and have lovely day."
4,"I am a ""real Hellrasier fan"", and I liked it.","I also liked Inferno and Hellseeker. The only one that I didn't like that much was Hellworld, and that one had really cool death scenes atleast.Yeah, this probably would have been better without the Hellraiser mythology tied in with the Deader cult thing, but it's still a strong entry in the direct-to-video part of the Hellraiser series. And if you're a ""true fan"", you'll probably rent this anyway, despite all the mixed reviews on this page. I would suggest renting it, definately. I really liked it. It's good for like...I dunno. If you're having a party with your friends, this would be a good movie to watch. Rent it...NOW!"
1,"..Yes, another run down Xfiles / Hellraiser.","All you true clive fans, steer clear, Far clear! Unless your in the mood for tons of head trips and attack scenes that allways end in someone waking and no blood shed, 1min of cinobites, 1.5mins of pinhead and a whole lot of crap diolouge. oh and just top off the mindlessness, lets throw in a total remake of uncle franks death from H1 but on another person. This one isnt even worth renting and checking out, wasnt even worth a DL. I'll watch 1-4 ANY day of the week, i'll pass on 5-7, as should anyone elts. Stop the madness...oh, forgot H8 is coming later this year. please..stop it."
4,No reason to die,"Of course, I haven't seen the film yet. But it's kind of troubling what happening to this franchise. TWO sequels have been sitting in the can for about two years or so, languishing while Dimension Films, which own the rights to the series now, have released such trash as Halloween: Resurrection.The Hellraiser franchise did not have to theatrically and commercially die this way. If they can churn out Freddy, Jason, Myers, and Chucky flicks, no doubt they can entertain with some more bloody and demented tales of the Cenobites. Oh well. Suffice to say this will be a must for the Hellraiser fan.I have no doubt that some hack will also pick up this series and try to totally restart it in Hollywood, where every drop of money will be squeezed from every forgotten franchise."
2,Not great.,"I love the hellraiser series, and I can honestly say I was dissapointed in this installment. It was boring, slow, and had bad visual effects (CGI chains, what the hell is that?).But the worst thing by far is that Pinhead was hardly in it. I dunno what's going on with the series but it seems that in every installment, we see Pinhead less and less.The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because it doesn't even come close to the piece of garbage the INFERNO was...Thank God for Hellworld...which isn't an amazing film, but still better then the last few sequels."
3,"Fine product, absurdly over priced","The product itself is fine, but I would not purchase this ""kit"" again because it is so overpriced. I needed to use approximately half the bottle (25mL) to do both my front and rear brakes; the bottle is good for only two uses.I paid a ridiculous premium for the small, convenient bottle size and the rubber tube and plastic bag. They are unnecessary; mineral oil is nontoxic, so you could just as easily put a newspaper under your bike (I used the extra oil to coat parts of my bike where the paint has chipped off).I wouldn't purchase this again: if you use your bike with any regularity you'll need to change the fluid every 4 months or so--buy in quantity and save money and time."
1,DO NOT BUY,SimpleTech did not send the Drive ordered they sent a USB ONLY DRIVE NOT A USB 2.0 / FireWire DRIVE....
3,The video quality is fine,"The four ten-minute shorts here vary from fairly charming (CLOWN PRINCES and ALFALFA'S AUNT) to mediocre (ALFALFA'S DOUBLE) to impressively awful (TIME OUT FOR LESSONS). The MGM Our Gang shorts aren't as good as those from the Hal Roach studio, but some of them are quite endearing. None of these are among them, as far as I'm concerned - THE BEST OF SPANKY and THE BEST OF BUCKWHEAT are both better collections - so I'd recommend this tape mainly to those of the series' devotees who feel they have to see everything."
5,Profound work!!!,"This is a wise, sensitive, warm book which illustrates what happens when people reach out for one another across language barriers and internal barriers. Here is an author who shows the Russian people as they are, human, heartbreaking and courageous. Ms. Shonk deftly treats all her charactors and their struggles equally, so invariably both American and Russian charactors speak the same universal language of loss and hope. I have never been to Russia, but I felt instantly transported there, and saw many similarities between our peoples. So, the only prerequisite for this book is an interest in human nature. READ IT!!! You'll be happy you did!"
5,Simplciity shrouds complexity in this fine collection,"As I've lived in Russia, the Red Passport rang a lot of bells. Apart from reflecting with considerable verisimilitude certain attitudes in Russia albeit from an American point of view, the difficulty of writing simple, successful prose while embodying complex truths is the main reason I wholeheartedly recommend this collection.I usually read non-fiction and this was the first collection of contemporary short stories I've read for a long time but also one of the finest and I was transfixed throughout."
1,Save your money!,"People considering buying this DVD should know two things:1) This short film can be seen for free (and, I believe, downloaded for free) at archive(dot)org (I am not sure about Amazon's policy regarding outside links) as well as many other short films and public domain feature films.2) The Rifftrax people, formerly the Mystery Science 3000 crew, covered this film on their DVD collection ""Best of Rifftrax Shorts Volume 2"", which can probably be purchased for about the price of this disc, and includes seven other shorts!So you can buy this if you want, but I don't know why you would."
5,Sparta Is My Hero!,"I just finished The Diamond Moon. Thoroughly enjoyed this fifth volume. I have always been a huge fan of Arthur C. Clarke and was skeptical when realizing he was a co-author, but have been extremely pleased with the masterful blend of true science fiction with an involving story line using mystery and engaging character development that I assume to be of Paul Preuss' design. This is not a book to be read on it's own, but to be enjoyed from the beginning and read through the end - (I'm going to get Volume 6 now).I have been hooked right from the start - accolades to Paul Preuss and Arthur C. Clarke!"
1,Dangerous-DO NOT USE,"Today I found my brake fluid on the garage floor and a crack in the side of the plastic reservoir. I installed this new MC 13 days ago.It worked great for the first 12 days. I can't wait to see how long it will take them to get a replacement to me. I'm pretty sure I'll be renting a car to go to work on Monday.I realize stuff happens, but these are Italian, not Chinese. I expected better. I guess this is what happens when I buy non-Honda parts for my Honda, but I've had good luck with other Centric brake parts. I'll review their customer service soon.BZOne week later:Amazon sent me a replacement. It lasted almost two days before the same thing happened. Apparently they're making the brake fluid reservoirs out of plastic that isn't compatible with brake fluid. The reservoirs crack and fall apart soon after they're filled with brake fluid. Besides being inconvenient and messy, it's also potentially very dangerous.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!BZ"
2,Unusual dud for Collins,"Wilkie Collins wrote so many enjoyable novels - - this is not one of them. It's just plain dull. Please read almost any other of his fine books that are well-loved and highly reviewed. If you only read this one, you might give up on a great author."
3,Disappointed,"I love acapella music, but I was disappointed with this offering from the Nassoons. While most of the close harmony of the complete group is wonderful and on pitch, sadly this cannot always be said for the soloists. ""Danny Boy"" is a case in point. I would love to hear the quality of the last two selections presented throughout the whole CD."
4,"Nice set, with some very nice C&W influence","Very nice disk, that is similar to their earlier stuff, but with a nice flavour of Country and Western in the mix. I'm usually not a big fan of Country, but they've done a nice job of touching it without stepping on it, and the overall effect is really nice. The disk gets back to Mabou in the later tracks, which is wonderful as it reminds me of a wonderful vacation I spent with my future wife up there. I'm enjoying this disk as much as North Country and Endless Seasons, even with the new directions. And if this disk grows on me the way the other two did, I'm am in for a real treat.The instrumentation is better too. Apparently they have been practicing, because the piano and guitar/mandolin tracks sound really good and really crisp. I think both production and playing are better.Also worth getting the disk to see how much the photo of their dad looks like Jimmy. Holy Cow, they brought the right kid home from the hospital . . ."
4,Wooden sushi food,I purchased this to go with the Sushi book and it makes a great gift set. The Doug and Melissa brand toys are always nice and this set was no different. Very pleased.
4,For the sushi lovers! (kids and parents),"Such a great little sushi set! I love the velcro sushi rolls...so cute & realistic! My little girl loves to ""dip"" the rolls into the soy sauce. It's one of her favorite pretend toys!"
5,Super cute,This set is so fun and cute. All the kiddos love to play with it when they come over to visit.
5,CUTE AND DURABLE!,"I first bought the Melissa and Doug sushi set for a friend's daughter. After a couple months passed by, Amazon had the Melissa and Doug sale and lo and behold the SUSHI set was on it! I had to grab it right away. My daughter's favorite part is cutting the sushi pieces with the 'knife' and serving it to us. Love Melissa and Doug and LOVE that they incorporate diversity into their toy mix. I'm hoping they come out with a lumpia and pancit set next..."
5,how fun and unique is this toy!!!!!!!,"I saw this toy and had to buy it for my Daughters fourth B-day. So many toys available start looking the same and do the same things but this was way different and so cute. I enjoy sushi but my Husband and Daughter hate it, however she loved the toy as she has seen me order sushi out time and time again. She calls it her ""sushi counter"". I love how strong and well made it is. Very fun and unique, and also a great value for the quality."
5,Sushi anyone?,"My children received this has a gift, and I liked it so much I got one for my nephews this Christmas. All the pieces are wood accept the felt ""ginger"" ( under the wasabi) and the green ribbon ""seaweed"" around 2 pieces. Most of the pieces have velcro dots, so you can stick them together in a long roll and then chop them apart with the knife and use the velcro chopsticks to pick them up. If your kids are like mine the ginger will get lost and the seaweed will get frayed, but we have had is for 4 or 5 years and thanks to the case the rest is all there and very playable."
5,Great and unusual product!,Our son goes with us to the local sushi restaurant all of the time. He was very excited to receive this gift for Christmas; he now makes is own sushi!
5,So fun to play with,"Got this for a friend's three kids (ages 9, 6, and 4) who love to go out for real sushi. They love coming home afterward and playing ""sushi restaurant"" with this. Super cute, colorful, real-looking pieces make this a fun imaginary play toy in addition to the regular kitchen toys they already own."
4,Great looking and fun too!,"My daughter loves the sushi set! She sits there and cuts the sushi rolls with the kid safe butcher knife. Don't get me wrong, all these are made of wood and have no sharp edges. The sushi pieces fit together using pieces of Velcro. I deducted 1 star from durability due to the fact that the Velcro can wear quickly with excessive play and the little straps around the Sashimi can come off quite easily and get lost. It's not the most educational toy unless your child plans on running a sushi bar when he/she gets older but hey, this is a toy, it serves its purpose when it comes to fun."
5,Super Sushi!,"My 10-yr old niece LOVES her wooden sushi set. The velcro is perfect, and makes all of her combination creations ""stay put"" perfectly, while she takes endless pictures of the various ""plates"" she creates. It's ""AWESOME"", in her words."
5,Awesome,"My daughter is 2 years old and received this for her birthday, and she loves it. She always wanted to pretend to eat sushi and/or with chopsticks.. and now it allows her to.. Its loved by all of our family.."
5,Love this set!,My 3 year old loves sushi so this kit was perfect for her! Well made with velcro on the chop sticks for easy fun practice with them. We have purchased many Melissa and Doug wooden food playsets and they never dissapoint. I love the durability of the wooden sets and the wooden storage box that they come in make for easy clean up.
2,KIDS NEED TO KNOW THE BACKGROUND OF SUSHI,MY KIDS LIKE THE CHOPPING KNIFE AND THE WAY THE PIECES STICK TOGETHERBUT THEY DIDNT GET THE FACT THAT THIS WAS SUSHI BUT OTHERWISE GREAT WOODEN TOY.
5,Girls loved it!,We got this for 2 different girls that were having birthdays the same day. They both love it and play with it all the time. Like all Melissa and Doug toys this is another good one.
5,Durable Long Lasting Fun,"Ordered this product for our aspiring chef. He had received some food of this brand before with wooden knives, cutting board and vegetables. Has spent countless hours playing with this toy set and even cut paper out to make sushi. So we decided to add a sushi set to the other. Great value and will last forever!!!"
4,Wow..something other than burgers and sandwiches,"If you're looking for something different in play food, then this set is the one for you. I scoured all over and found this set for my daughter's play kitchen, since she already has plastic play food with the typical hamburgers/fries/sandwiches/fruit/veggies. It's so much more durable. My daughter cuts and serves us sushi everyday. =P"
5,"Finally,a book about Buddhists!","This fresh look at the actual practice of Tibetan Buddhists is a nice change from the traditional overview dealing with philosophical intricacies. Dowman looks at the practice through and folk lore and traditions that make up the history of the people. Issues such as how Buddhists relate to their environment and how that has effect the unique form of Buddhism that arose from the Tibetan culture are dealt with in such a way to appeal to experts and students alike. The amount of material covered is amazing, as well as the depth."
5,Improving on Excellence!,"Could a follow-up book possibly be just as good--if not better--than the original? Author Stephanie Kimura proves it can in her wonderful follow-up to the hugely successful Bags with Style. In this book, Stephanie goes beyond just bags and adds instruction on how to create some of the most fashionable accessories that are staples to any stylish woman's wardrobe. Yes, there are mostly bags, but you'll also learn how to create shrugs, shawls, belts, collars, cell phone carriers and even a romantic stole! Beginners and advanced sewers alike will revel in the 27 projects from the casual to the exquisite. Success is inevitable when you couple the full-size patterns (we're talking pattern company quality patterns) with 200 fabulous photos and 65 helpful how-to illustrations. As Stephanie puts it, this book ""is for talented and creative women like you."" When you put it like that, how can you possibly resist?!"
4,The first was better ...,"I purchased this book after buying Ms. Kimura's first, ""Bags With Style"". Though this has more fun ideas, the same great construction and fabric chapters, and easy to use instructions, I just did not find it quite as inspirational as her first. Patterns are included and the instructions are clear and concise. The accessories did not wow me and some of the bag designs seemed a bit redundant. There are some fun ones in here, especially the one on the cover! Still a good book but I would recommend her first more."
2,horribly made,"The premise for this series is ridiclous. The first character wants revenege on ""The Matador"", because he beat her when she was twelve, thus robbing her of the bail money to get her Dad out of jail, who died as a result. That might not be spot on but its that level of stupidty. The two other main characters have just as dumb of a reason for revenge. Furthermore, all three are willing to risk their lives to beat the matador. Not only is it merely money, but it wouldn't prove much if they did win. Poker does have a good deal of luck in it. Also, pros lose large sums of money quite reguarely, the manador would just win it back from them or someone else. The manador also cheats to win, which is ridiclous. If he was ""the man"", he wouldn't need to cheat. Finally, the writing is horrible. The Great lines Matt Damon uses in Rounders are nowhere in this series. Oh they try, but fail miserably. This series is over the top and barely entertaining."
2,DON'T BOTHER,"When I saw this show in my local store I jumped right in and bought it. I expected an intelligent and entertaining show. I loved the movie Rounders and I thought this show might live up to it's potential, sadly that it not the case. This really could have been a great show, but it's just chewing gum for the brain. If you liked Rounders and like poker don't buy this as you'll be disapointed."
4,Better than a Yankee?!,"My father had the Yankee version of these long before I came along, so I have been exposed to the basic tool idea for years. However, I've been using cordless drills for drilling and driving, but have noticed lately that the batteries don't hold a charge more than a day or so. So I thought for the price this would be a good back up, or even a replacement. It functions quite well to drive phillips multi-purpose screws directly into cedar without drilling holes first.I wish it weren't made in China, but whatcha gonna do?"
5,the best hand tool,this tool is a must for any one who works with hand tools or dose odd jobs I highley recomend this tool.
5,"Great ""dry"" D at a good price...","I use this product religiously for years now. Remembering that ""dry"" D is recommended for therapy, this is a great price."
2,Disc is in BD Profile 2.0 only,"This disc won't play in all Blu-ray players.It will not play in my Denon BDCI 3800 Blu-ray player I bought 2 years ago. I contacted Denon tech support and after 2 months of research they discovered the problem. This disc which was manufactured in Blu-ray Profile 2.0 only which means it will only play in newer Blu-ray players. Most discs created in Blu-ray Profile 2.0 are backwards compatible with older Blu-ray 1.x Profile players. This disc is not backwards compatible.The Blu-ray Profile (1, 1.1 or 2) is the actual hardware of the player and no firmware update can change a Blu-ray Profile 1.x player into a Blu-ray Profile 2 player.Blu-ray Profiles explained:Blu-ray Profile 1 - Has simple menu items like a DVD menu.Blu-ray Profile 1.1 - Has pop-up menus like most Blu-ray discs.Blu-ray Profile 2 - Also known as BD-live with the ability to access content from the internet and 1GB of internal storage."
3,Pricy for one movie,"What was originally to be a significant part of the second season was converted into a single movie instead, leaving a truly awful collection of tv episodes in its place. Movie is good as the original novel was, but at great cost to the series.All in all, good movie, but overpriced for the US market."
2,Blu-ray disc won't play on BR player,"I have a Magnavox Blu-Ray/DVD player (nb500mg1f), and the blu-ray disc for the movie won't play on this player. Kinda disappointed. Like what Mark a Breeden said, make sure your player has BR Profile 2.0.But the movie is alright."
5,Im biased,"I like the Haruhi series and have seen the TV anime, so I could follow story without any issues. For anyone who liked Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu, I would recommend this movie. It's good and I hate doing reviews."
5,The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya (Blu-ray/DVD Combo),Was a big fan when it first came out!Amazing anime movie to see again!Great anime was received!I'm gonna keep watching this anime time and time again!
4,Great movie for fans of the series.,First off this movie is long. IF you have not seen the tv series the movie will take a while to make sense. For those that are fans of the series you'll love it.
1,I hate it >=(,"I bought this product in early 2009. After 4 months of use one bulb failed, and now to this date (07/27/2009) a ballast failure. I don't recommend this HID conversion kit"
2,Not What I Thought,I bought this conversion kit almost a year ago and had one bulb fail only 1 month after I installed the kit then another 3 months later the ballast failed and cut in and out while I was driving and now it won't work at all.
4,"A good effort, mostly","I took a break from gathering wood for my weekly heretic burning in my front yard so I could read Kellmeyer's book. I really liked it, and would have given it five stars. However, I was somewhat disappointed to find that Kellmeyer's superbly-done close examination of Brown's worthless drivel sheds so much light but generates only a little heat. Kellmeyer pulls too many of his punches, which in my opinion is not a prudent course of action. After all, the fans of Dan Brown's book who have been posting all these deceptive or bigoted one-star reviews haven't been pulling their punches."
1,Kellmeyer Fails To Deliver,"This is a very poor response to The Da Vinci Code. The book makes all kinds of assertions, but simply does not provide adequate documentation from historical sources to back up what Kellmeyer says in response to Brown.It seems that Kellmeyer just got an idea to write a book that says ""Bad Brown, Bad Brown,"" then hoped that his readers (probably a mostly Roman Catholic audience) would just believe him.This is the stereotypical preaching to the choir book. Nothing fresh, nothing illuminating, nothing even very convincing. In fact, after reading this book, I would be more inclined to believe Brown. Not necessarily because Brown's novel is so reliable, but because Kellmeyer so miserably botched refuting Brown."
1,Hey I've got a great idea,"The Da Vinci Code is a worldwide phenomenon, staying on the New York Times Bestseller List for over 2 years. I think I'll throw together a quicky book with some alternate intepretations of biblical ""history"" that I got from looking up websites with Google one weekend. I'll slap the name ""Da Vinci Code"" in the title of my book and market it to delusional paranoids who spend every waking minute thinking about how the arts and entertainment world is at war with Christianity. I'll make a forture off someone else's success. It sure beats working for a living!God Bless America"
1,Kind of funny,"Kellemyer takes the Da Vinci Code way too seriously and engages in some really-over-the-top writing. It's very much a polemic, and not a reasoned look at a rather silly book."
3,Good C++ tips. But .....,"The author show his understanding of C++. What is essence of that? It only show that the C++ is a difficult language. How can you show the language is difficult,at the same time, show that C++ is the language of choice."
4,Getting your C++ constructs strait.,"For programmers that are already familiar with the basics of C++ programming but who still hesitate as to which C++ construct to use, when, where, and how to use it... this is the right book.Besides, it is written in a very pleasant style. It reads more like a novel than a reference manual."
4,"Good tips, but there is room for improvement.",This book contains a lot of useful tips. Sure it is not the book to get if you are doing your homework for your C++ class. But you will find it enlightening if you have a fairly good understanding of C++.
3,"Highly recommended for a new to moderately experienced C++ programmer , not so much for one with some experience","I started reading this book when i had about 6 years of C++ experience when preparing for an interview so wanted to brush up some concepts. I was out of touch with advanced C++ for 2 years but was doing some C++ programming in-between.I found it to be pretty basic. When you have some good C++ programming experience you learn all these thing which are mentioned in the book. But If i had read this book a couple of years ago i would have learnt these concepts much earlier, rather than learning them the hard way. So if you are like a college student or graduate with a basic C++ programming experience, but you want to learn next level , then this is the book for you."
5,"Spend 20 years programming C++, or read this one book","This little 1/2 inch thick book will change your life. It teaches you great habits and tells you what to avoid like the plague. EXTREMELY clear and to the point, the newest edition (2nd) covers (and uses extensively) all the new and great features of the final draft standard. Buy it right now!"
4,"High quality book, but mostly trivia","I think this is a high quality book, along with its sequel ""More effective C++.""However, if you already have enough experience in programming or at the very least have been ""book smart"" by reading Stroustrup or Lippman, you do not need to waste your money and time investing in this book.I picked up the book after reading enough books in C++, I immediately saw the ""diminishing returns of investment"" on reading books relative to the same topics. This means that this book, although excellent to be fair, does not stand out by offering anything new that I have not known from somewhere else.I would rate this book 4-star as at least it does not contain wrong messages. Just venture out a little and see how many jokes you will find in the authors that claim themselves experts."
4,"In response to Jim W of Plano, TX...","You say Dell monitors don't have Service Tags??? You guessed wrong; they have Service Tags, though they'ren't so obvious at first glance. First, they are five-digit (XX-XXX) codes printed on either the bottom-left or bottom-right corner of the back, and they'ren't preceded by a ""Service Tag"" label. They usually appear on the same area as the manufacture date (which is pretty obvious). Hope this will help every potential Dell screen buyer..."
3,Great for games,"This monitor is great for games. No ghosting, and the colors are outstanding.As TV/HDTV, the picture is too dark, and tends to be redish. Also, I had to return it twice because of a dead pixel and a purple vertical line on the right hand side of the screen.If you want a monitor to watch videos then this monitor is not for you."
4,cheap and serves the purpose,"At $2 from amazon, you really can't go wrong. Item is pretty rugged and holds 4 SD memory cards. The clip looks fairly heavy duty but the links that connect it to the case may not be as strong."
3,Its cheap for a reason,I bought this only for holding my memory stick pro duo cards. The case just secures it one side. So it's not a secure as i would want it to be. However it keeps the cards in place. There are much better cases on amazon than this one such as this onePlastic Secure Digital Memory Card Case & Holder for SD (3 Case Pack no memory cards included)
1,generic sd card holder,"I bought another card holder for a few more dollars, it can hold 20-30 sd cards enclosed in duriable plastic, well worth a few more bucks."
4,Nobody Listens to Me,I am a fifth grade reading teacher. I use this book when the science teacher is doing the whale unit. This book is excellent for teaching conflict. man vs. man; man vs. nature;man vs. politics and man vs. self. I am anxious for this book to be printed again-- then I can stop searching used book stores for replacement copies.
5,Great tones,They sound great and we will see how long they last. I wish they would come as a 3 pack though.
5,Great Books,Lisa's war is an exquisite book for all ages. It's about a girl named Lisa and how she helps many peoples lives in World War II. If you like the history on World War II you will love this book because it has to do with Germany invading Denmark. If like to read you'll love Lisa's War!
2,Book Review for Lisa's War,"I really enjoyed Lisa's War. It was hard to follow at first, but I kept reading and found that it was a great, exciting and fun book! It is a story about a girl and her family and friends during World War ll and how she tries to help other Jews. I would recommend this book to kids and adults of all ages!"
5,A Soul-searching Drama that We All Need,"I really have never heard of this movie before but it caught my eye, while reviewing selections. This soul-searching story gets to the heart of what life is really all about. We don't need money and material things to be truly happy, which some eventially come to realize in this story. All of us really need what this wonderful story teaches us; that life is too precious and too short to waste it on bitterness, regret, and selfishness. Forgiveness is a powerful and wonderful emotion in the journey of life. And love and faith will conquer all."
3,the love of Shirley Bassey,"Another best of album from Shirley Bassey ,that worth buying it if you don ' t have any of her best of albums.This cd inludes some of the most known songs ,such as something , love story ,what now my love , and one of my favourite songs "" time after time "" ,which is known from a drink advertisment"
2,Does NOT fix Mita DC-1860!,"I can't review whether this toner is any good in the Mita DC-1860 copier because it is NOT compatible. The hole-tabs that are supposed to fit snugly onto the copier do NOT line up on this product. We bought four of these for our office copier, stowed them away till needed (a few months later) and only then discovered that the bottles do not fit. (We've had this copier for years and could easily tell that it does not physically fit.) Unfortunately, ReStockIt is currently telling us that their returns policy is expired for this item and they will not accept a return. Even though it is their LISTING that is FALSE.We're not happy about this and wanted to pass along the fact that these are NOT compatible with the Mita DC-1860, despite being listed as compatible right here on their listing. We can only hope that they will update this information soon and that no one else will lose money on this incorrectly listed item."
1,did not like it,This show was typical entertainment. I don't recommend it at all. Nothing new or exciting at all. Just typical life.
2,MY GRADE: C minus.,"Attractive British people and a few of them see the dead? What's not to like? A lot, actually. I suspect they play the creepy stuff too safe which was one of the draws to this series for me and to add to it there isn't enough supernatural. Pass.OVERALL GRADE: C minus."
1,Bedlam,"If ghosts are your thing, then Bedlam will be quite the wallow, because there are more spirits than you can say boo to in this haunted mental asylum-turned-posh condo complex. Unhappy ghosts lurk everywhere in these corridors, waiting to pounce on anyone with a sexual peccadillo or illicit skeleton in their designer closets. Though the stories provide plenty of jolts, Bedlam becomes less scary with repetition during its six-episode duration, because we can see these persistent ghouls all too easily. So can Jed, the troubled empath whose past is linked to Bedlam Heights' sordid history.Jed keeps busy in each episode trying to avert all manner of deadly spectral mischief -- the premiere is big on creepy water effects -- but by the sixth episode, when two of his sexy single roomies are playing with tarot cards in a bedroom full of candles, you figure they're just asking for it. Why don't they all just move?"
5,helps me stay on my game!,"I was recommended this product by an amazing health guru. Needless to say, if you are a bit scatterbrained sometimes, and need a product to help you focus, this is it! Works really well!"
4,What a wonderful little book....,"I've read this three times now, and each time the collection just gets better. As an introduction to Peter S. Beagle, it's a good starting point, especially if you find the whimsicality of The Last Unicorn to your liking. Even the cover art by Mike Dashow introduces you to the unique worlds created by Peter Beagle. The title story alone is worth the price of the book, and, ah, if only we could all have a visitor like that to our library! I do recommend this - as well as all of Peter's titles - and this one is easily found through the publisher, Tachyon, as well. Kudos to them for printing such a delightful book."
3,"Good guide, not equipped with everything.","While I speak very very very little Japanese, I noticed some discrepancy between the basic greetings and dialogue that I have learned from many other sources and this book, and I was surprised. I know that the same words and phrases can translate in more than one way, so perhaps that is the reason this book translates it as such. The information is basic and good, it was lacking in some of the other basic information I was seeking. Overall, a good guide, small, light, great paper material, and easy to travel with, and it does not get wet easily."
5,Libman Small Scrub Brush,"We had purchased one of these brushes ""over"" 10 years ago. Eventually the brush started to wear out. We never though we would find one until we looked up Libman on Amazon.com - We were surprised to find almost the exact brush (the only differerce was the handle had changed) We order the brush and it was exactly what we wanted. After checking some other household items, we found we also had a Libman broom which we have had a long time and it is still in good shape. Yes, we would rate all Libman products a Five Star rating."
2,Samll Scrub Brush,"I thought that the bristles could handle tough bathroom scum, without scratching the bathtub surface. I was wrong. I do not feel that it was worth the price either."
3,Once He Loves,"This is probably a 3.5 stars for me. I didn't think it quite deserved a 4. It's not that it was a bad book, it just was not that exciting. I liked Ivo for he was honest and nice even though he has the wounded soul of a disgraced knight. I also agree with other people that Briar was a little too prickly. I just did not fell the chemistry there. This book does answer who killed Anna in ""The Lily and the Sword"". It was not who you would have guessed even though I had my suspicions from hints earlier in the book, and I was right. The one thing I did find stupid was he was missing 3 fingers and no one noticed, just because he was wearing a glove. They all acted like they could not see 3 fingers missing. A glove would not have hidden that. Anyway you should still read this book if you are reading the series. I am hoping Henry's story is better than this one."
3,Once He Loves,it was ok the the heroine charater begin to get on my nerves halfway into the story and this book is part of a series and I want to read all of them but overall I enjoyed this book so I am hoping I will like the next one I read.
5,should have done this sooner,i wish there was a way to go back & edit feedback but this will have to do. while the product did arrive after the expected date it was exactly what i ordered. it was very well protected for shipping to prevent damage & there was not alot of wasted packaging. i did recieve an email from tha company asking me to go back & remove the 3 star rating once the jacket arrived. im still not sure how i feel about that. the important thing to note is that this is a good company & i will always check them out when looking for items. the quality far exceeds the very slight minor delay in the arrival time
3,Spoilerish and Bulky,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. I remember reading them as a kid and LOVING the stories, so I thought I'd introduce her to the Fear Street series this way.I thought I was getting a boxed set of 3 books; the description wasn't too clear that it was actually 1 book that contained all 3 stories. As a result of all 3 stories being in the same book, and the synopsis of each story being inside the front cover, my daughter has already been spoiled that one of the sisters dies in the first story. It's also a little large for a small person's hands; she's 10, but she has petite hands so it's not comfortable for her to hold the book for long periods of time to read.Other than that, it's a great buy. The price is wonderful, and the book was in good condition when we received it."
5,"A Great ""Horrifying"" Novel!","This book contains the 99 Fear Street trilogy. In The First Horror, twin sisters Cally and Kody Frasier movie into 99 Fear Street where they are the first family to experience the horror. In The Second Horror, Brandt McCloy movies in the house in where he doesn't know an evil ghost is already living inside the house. In The Third Horror, Kody Frasier has a movie about the horrors of 99 Fear Street."
4,Li YI Min is good!,"Li Yi Min stars as a young student of a drunken master, who gets caught up in some trouble with a group of masters, and a Nomad expert. After being delt a good beating, he returns to his teacher to learn a secret style that will guarentee him redemption. Good action, and some cool bad guys, including a sharp, and deadly snake style master. very entertaining."
3,Old Skool Kung Fu!1,"This flick was just ""o.k"" I though,,,i know what this kid is capable of, but he did not deliver in this movie. However,,it does have some really great fight scenes,,,definately some old school performance!!"
3,"Same old kung fu flick you've seen plenty of times, but good fights, so I can't complain","Lee I Min stars as a young kung fu master in one of the best performances of his career. Simon Yuen teaches him from a young age and Lee I Min grows up to be an expert. He has no problem handling weak kung fu experts played by Lee Siu Ming and Lee Man Tai, but then he runs into Lung Tien Sheng, who is probably best known for playing The Rambler in Flag of Iron, and he was in a lot of other Venoms movies, and gives a great performance in this movie. So after Lee I Min loses he goes back to his master to learn more kung fu. Then he goes to defeat Lung Tien Sheng. So like I said you've seen this type of story plenty of times before, and there's nothing new here, except some good fights.3.5/5 (this movie would get a 1/5 if it wasn't for the 2 fights between Lee I Min and Lung Tien Sheng)Picture quality on the Groundzero DVD is decent, but most importantly it's letterboxed. The English dub sounds pretty good."
5,The Greatest,"""Drunken Wu Tang"", the greatest martial arts movie ever made! It's a rip-roaring tale of martial mayhem, as the Wu Tang clan find themselves employing every crazy stunt in the book in order to combat groin-munching monsters, handheld cluster bombs, giant pipe kung fu, and the spiky antics of porcupine back. Don't miss the Yuen Brothers in their greatest adventure ever. This is the tale of one ""Old Devil"", who was banished to the under world for some unknown and most likely insane reason, who is now back and on a quest to capture the ""secret documents"" and the only one who can stop him is one ""Drunken Old Fool"" who can't put down the bottle (or gourd) and drives around in a yellow rat mobile. There is no real plot or reason to this movie, but its total randomness and insane action scenes are the best to be found in any b rate kung fu movie. If you are into these types of films or if you just need a good laugh, this is the movie to see."
5,Perfect first books,"Perfect first book collection. My son is 21 months old now and still loves 'Hello Bee, Hello Me'. Highly recommend."
4,Great Book Set for Baby,"Bought these for my 8 month old grandson who loved them all (except for the photo album). Simple messages, bright colors and washable pages add up to a nice collection at a reasonable price. He especially loved the book with lift-up flaps and a mirror at the end. The one with the teether is cute, too."
2,Plastic baby books,"So I don't think that a plastic baby book that is expected to be put in the mouth should have a horrible chemical plastic smell. This just doesn't seem right to me. The smell still hasn't gone away & we don't let my son put them in his mouth, so overall not a good buy."
