3,What is this!!!,There was nothing wrong with frontline. IT WAS PERFECT!!! The campaign is terrible in rising sun. i beat it on the highest difficulty in 3 hours!! The only thing in this game that is even somewhat good is the multiplayer. Me and my friends can sit down and have some fun with it for about an hour. European Assault is gonna hafta be better for the franchise to continue.
5,THE GREATNESS OF EA,EA is a great company they made great games especially there war games if you are a mom that is worried about what type of violence is in there games no EA game i have ever played had no blood andthat is what's so cool im 19 yrs. old and to be honest i don't like games with blood but that's me so if you are wondering wheather or not to buy from EA or scared because of violence and/or blood EA has violence but no pudddles of blood EA's war series have made me cry because that's how good they are so tell me what you think
2,"Carefully scripted, totally linear","yeah, best graphical experience.. give us mouse control with those usb ports on the PS2, how about some cooperative single player... some thing."
5,Medal of Honor: Rising Sun,"Needless to say, Medal of Honor: Frontline was a masterpiece! Everyone wanted to own this game. Move on to Medal of Honor: Rising Sun. Why didn't so many people want this game like the original? Because the original had the assault on Omaha Beach (D-Day) and led into the campaign against the Nazi's in World War II. The new one starts with the Pearl Harbor bombings and leads into the campaign against the Japanese in the South Pacific during WWII. Why not the hype? I cannot answer that, but the simple fact of the matter is that this game was amazing graphic-wise. Also, the story is amazing, the videos they show after each level is awsome, and the sound is Dolby 5.1! If you have an amazing surround sound system and a 42"" big screen television, you will be in another world, like me! As for it being easier?!? Try changing the difficulty!"
1,Not enough bang for the buck!!,"I have bought & played all of the Medal of Honor games, beginning with the PS1 versions, and loved them all, but, I must admit (like so many others here already have) this game is a dissapointment. It seems too easy to play compared to the others, but the BIGGEST letdown is the length of the game! At what should be about the halfway point of the other MOH games, this one rolls credits!! I thought at first it must be just an intermission, but no, the game was in fact over already! Be smart...rent it, finish it in just a few hours, and save the $50 for a game you can buy and feel you got your money's worth."
3,Should not be compared to MoH: Frontline,"This game by itself is OK at best. But if you are expecting it to be anywhere near its predecessor, you'll be pretty dissapointed. A few of the bright spots were the deck guns on the Pearl Harbor level and being the rear gunner on the last level. Not worth $50 in my opinion, wait until its down to $19.99 or rent it, you'll have it beat within a day or two."
3,Short Rising Sun,"Let me start off by saying, I really enjoy the first medal of honor. The game almost goes on forever, and I have no problem playing it over again. I bought Rising Sun, changed the difficulty to hard, and was able to finish the game in a few hours. I even played it again to make sure that I hadn't missed something. I didn't. I have yet to play the multiplayer version, but the single player version is just too short.To sum it up, the game is cool, but only 7 different levels? It's just too short for $50. And pay no attention to the other post with the ""mouth drooling"" and what not. I'm guessing that is someone trying to market the game.If you haven't bought the first one, buy it, and leave this one on the shelf. If you're bored and it is cold outside (my situation) you might as well pick this one up."
4,A fun game but way too short.,Rising Sun starts out with a lot of action and maintains a good storyline all the way through. Its just too bad that the game ends right when it starts to get real interesting.There is a lot of amazing scenery and great variety where the action takes you. Overall I think it was a very nicely designed game and it would be great if they could make a part 2 to pick up where this one left off. Definitely worth playing even with the shortcomings.
2,Don't waste your time or your money,"This game is a rip-off! Its unbelievably short: I beat the game in one afternoon. There are only a few levels and its WAY shorter than MOH Frontline.This game is also incredibly unrealistic. I felt more like Rambo in this game than an American soldier. You kill the Japanese, move forward and get ammo, and keep killing. You don't have to conserve ammo, you don't have to worry about getting hit because theres always health right there.The only part of the game I remotely enjoyed was the very first level where you have to shoot down some incoming planes. After that level, though, its all downhill. The levels are small and narrow. There is very little room for you to manuever.This game is REALLY, REALLY short and REALLY, REALLY bad. I'm so thankful that I rented it instead of buying it. Don't get this game."
5,Probably the best 1st person shooting game to date,The 2 player campaign is lots of fun. The multiplayer death match is extremely addictive. Its alittle short but most 1st person shooters that are new are short.
3,Good game but short story,"MOH Frontline was great.So was rising sun.I wouldhave gave it five stars but the story is so dangshort.Frontline had better graphics than rising sun.It has a great story line but like I said, ITS SHORT!"
2,This is what happens when $$ matter more than quality,"I am a huge MOH follower but this game is nothing short of a rip off. First of all it is too short I finished in one weekend, the graphics leave a lot to be desired with dead soldiers that seem to float. This game would have been worth $19.99 but at anything over that it is a rip-off"
2,A let down after Frontline,"I'm not a big FPS games fan, but I got hooked on to MOH Frontline which I thoroughly enjoyed. So I bought MOH Rising Sun expecting it to be even better...what a let down it was! The game was way too easy and when it abruptly came to an end, I was very disappointed. The storyline and missions are not bad, but the level of difficulty and the dumb soldiers are ridiculous. The graphics are mediocre. In the single-player missions your comrades sometimes get in between you and the enemy, and your enemy can still shoot at you but you can't! I think two pluses for this game - it now costs only 15 bucks or so, and the game has save points all along the various missions (a big improvement over Frontline)."
4,A FUN GAME BUT NOT FRONTLINE,I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT GAME. IM A MOH FAN. IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED. IT WAS HALF AS LONG AS FRONTLINE. IT ONLY TOOK MY 3 DAYS TO FINISH AND I DIDN'T PLAY MUCH. I DO LIKE HOWEVER THE MULTIPLAYER MODE AND ONLINE MODE.
3,Where's the sequel?,"MoH rising sun ended poorly. Next to having poor enviromental graphics, thats what dissapointed me the most. Ending the game with a major cliffhanger, was a stupid descision for EA games to make. Escpecially since they never made the sequel. As far as I know."
2,not good,"Its not a terrible game, and if I had never played any of the MOH games I might have liked it. But, I did, and it stinks. It doesn't compare to any of the other MOH games, going back to the original. Even the music isn't as good. I am very disappointed. It's funny how the only good reviews were written before the game came out. Ignore them."
4,Great multiplayer mode,"Whenever I play this game I do the multiplayer mode. It is very fun because you can set up bots to play on your team and the other teams. You can set up team deathmatch in every map in the game. It's an awesome multiplayer mode. The campaign however can get very confusing. You can't save the game unless you find a save spot. Overall though, this game is worth buying."
3,Doesn't Cut It!,"I've got all the MOH games going back to the original on the PS1. I could play every one over and over and not got bored, except this one. This is not up to standards. First of all, it is poor quality. The games physics and AI are terrible, the control is awful, and it is sloppy (going to cut scenes in the middle of a battle). I particularly like hitting an enemy in the chest with my Springfield from 2 feet and he keeps coming and stabs me to death. This game does not have the feel the others do. Its not half the game Frontline is. More like a quarter. And the graphics are no better then Frontline. I don't know where that rumor came from."
1,WTH is this,This game sucks. Its so unrealistic. Its crap. Dont buy this peice of crap. Its doesnt even get 1 star.
2,"ouch, what a waste of money","This game is part of a long line games in the Medal of Honor Series. They have made several prestigous games, but this one is certainly laking. The game play is fun, but it is far to easy for the average FPS gamer. You would be much better off renting this game at blockbuster because it can be beaten in under three days by someone playing for two hours a day. When comparing this game with Call of Duty for PC there is no competition. Rising Sun is deficient in all catagories compared with Call of Duty. So save your money and by Call of Duty, because you will enjoy it more than Rising Sun. Overall this is a flashy game with good graphics and guns, but it lacks in every other catagory."
1,not enough missions,I am very disapointed in the medal of honor games there is not enough missions! for what I paid for this game it should have more missions it only took me 5 and a half hours to complete this game it should have taken me longer and there should be more missions so for this game I have to give it a big thumbs down
4,buy it now!,this is the best game ever made by ea! my favorite missones are day of infamy and perle harbor although as most games it does have its disatvantages im sorry to say but it is better than MOH frontline this games levels are longer and the enemy are harder to kill so i just go to cheatplanet .com
4,Medal of Honor - Rising Sun,"According to my 13 year old, this game is ""vintage"" but a blast to play. And it was a great deal!"
2,3 Stars of Single Player; 1 Star for Multiplayer,"Multiplayer for Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is absolutely a joke. Movement is horrendous (basically forward, backward, left, right with very little variation). Aiming is virtually impossible; one must just ""pray and spray"". The maps are extremely small and confining.Expecting multiplayer to be like SOCOM or SOCOM:II? Forget it. Try DOOM for PC circa 1995. In fact, the multiplayer is so bad, you can load up a game just to amuse your friends with how bad it is.Another thing: First Person shooters are, IMHO, better on PC platforms anyway. The aiming and movement with mouse and keyboard are A LOT more precise than with analog sticks and D-pads.For die-hard MOH fans only (of which I thought I was one...)"
3,"Interesting, but not worth the money","After playing the predecessor (MOH Front Line), I would reccomend waiting to but this game until it becomes a Greatest Hits...The action was good, but not what I expected. I found the game play to be too short and repetetive. Solving it was no problem in 2 days time. Although, the game was more fluid-like from the previous, I would like to see a sequel that offers a little more of a challenge...Like I said, do try this game when it becomes a Greatest Hit..."
2,Classic EA. Their game sequels get worse over time......,"If you played MOH Frontline, you will approach this game with a certain excitement that will go away once you realize the game is over. It is a short game and, at times, confusing. After you destroy the aircraft carrier, you get the impression that there is more, but there isnt. The game leads you to believe that you are moving on to save your brother, but that isnt the case. EA, please reinvest your profits into your games. Wake up, people stopped buying FIFA, dont let that happen to another one of your great games, MOH!!"
1,Possibly one of the worst games i have played,"week upon week i traveled up to the local video store hoping to get the new MOH and onee day it's there so i put it in the ps2 and it's kind of like the terminator... kill kill sometimes have a hard mission, the AI sucks the japs do nothing there accuracy is horrible even on the HARD difficulty level the extremely anti-climactic ending. WAY to easy i beat it in 1 day and took it back, no re-playability. back to its to easy, way to easy soooo many surgical packs and medicine cantines even a 8 year oild could beat this game..take my advice dont even rent this game,find a friend who has it and borrow it, i dont think they'll care it's so bad"
2,okay game... maybe worth renting,"Despite the critisism that this game gets and all the people harping on it, i must admit that it is somewhat decent. Overall gameplay is mediocre of not rightout horrible. the welrod gun and rigley field were what i loved most about it. pearl harbor was ok but the enemies always flew in the same old predictable patterns. maybe worth renting... buy MOH Frontline instead."
3,WHAT A LET DOWN! RISING CRAP!,"Are these the same makers as ""Frontline""?The AI was horrible.The missions we're nothing but carnage.Too much health lying around.TOO DARK TO SEE THE GUADANCANAL LEVEL.Why did Guadacanal take all weekend but Singapore take an hour?What the hell is a Welrod anyways?""Call of Duty"", here I come..."
1,The absolute worst shooter I have ever played!!!!!,I absolutely hate this dumb game!the controls are crappy and gameplay is the worst!I've expected more from the medal of honorseries!Buy european assault!good advice!
4,U must buy THIS game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is da best Medal of Honnor game ever. Only problem is that it takes for ever to load. It is da bomb. U can take control of turrets at some points of the game. And wuts really fun is when ur doin co-op mode you can get respawned. Also in co-oop it's fun to try and run away fromn those phsyco knife weilding freaks who try to tear the flesh right off of u. It's like a game of survivor. There are sniper rifle u use to snipe the people dead. It is a fun game if u like first person shooters.
4,none,"Rising Sun was not as interesting as frontline, because I personally like the Europe war more than Asia. Good Graphics and stellar snipers."
2,Was finished before I started!,Unbelievably short game. Seems like EA simply wanted to pump out a follow-up to the hugely successful Frontline before people forgot about it (and in time for Christmas). Takes about 1/4 the time to complete as its predecessor. I just couldn't believe that I'd reached the end of this game within the first couple days of purchasing it. I was a HUGE fan of MOH Frontline and was anxiously waiting for this one. In a word...disappointing.
1,great game but gameplay is terrible,"The Medal of Honor series should have stayed on the PC. Although the graphics and sound score are great, using the controller on a PS2 is incredibly awkward and frustrating. I've never played a game even on a console where one thumb/joystick is for you to look up and down and the other one is to look left and right. Not to mention the reaction time is slow and unless there is an ability to increase the sensitivity of being able to strafe left and right faster there really is no point. Using a mouse on a PC allows you to use your whole hand to direct your line of fire rather than relying on your thumb. I feel robbed paying $50 for a game that I don't want to play anymore. If you have played Frontline you may like this game but if you are mainly a PC gamer like myself I'd wait and save your money until hopefully they put this game on the PC."
5,Good Game With Flaws,"I think this game is good. I like the fact that they went another direction with the Medal of Honor Series and the beginning is great. Though it kind of goes bad after that. The level design is a bit lacking and it is a bit dark, thuogh that's how WWII was fought in Japan. The Japanese shouldn't go suicidal all the time. The Japanese also shoudn't be that stupid. The game is also a bit sluggish. But overall I like the entire game and the concept and levels and especially the biginning. I still love this game still and am a fan of Medal of Honor."
1,CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP,"Me and a friend of mine played Frontline for 2 weeks and couldn't put the controler down. WELL FOR RISING SUN WE THREW THE CONTROLER'S DOWN AFTER ABOUT A DAY IN TOTAL SHOCK OF HOW SUCKY THIS GAME IS. IT'S SHORT, LAME AND NOT WORTH 50 BUCKS. If your going to buy this with your HARD EARNED MONEY wait till the hype dies or rent it. Go by FRONTLINE. AVOID PAYING HARD EARNED CASH OR YOUR MOM AND DAD'S FOR THAT MATTER AND BORROW IT FROM A FRIEND WHO WISHES HE/SHE NEVER BOUGHT IT."
1,The worst ending of any game I've ever played...,"To those of you who are in the middle of playing this game, don't bother to finish it. After about 6 or 7 levels, the game is over with a terrible climax. In MOH Frontline, you find the Nazi which you've been chasing for most of the game and kill him toward the end. However, in Rising Sun, you end up chasing this Japanese guy and never actually get to him. To me, it's obvious that the makers of this game were more worried to get this game out by Christmas time than to actually make a quality game, and rushed the end. Also, to beat this game, it takes absolutely no effort at all, even on hard difficulty."
4,This a great game!!!,Dont listen to the people who say it is stupid and too short. It is a little short. But the levels are bigger and take longer to beat. It gets more involved in your family and you. You play as Joseph Griffin. A U.S. Marine. If u like war games you should buy this game.
1,Disappointing,"Frontline is my all time favortie PS2 game, so I had really been looking forward to getting this game. All I can say is that the only thing this game shares with Frontline is the name ""Medal of Honor"". Boring game with lame levels and storyline make this game a terrific waste of money. Whereas I still play Frontline from time to time I will never play Rising Sun again now that I have completed it. Should have just rented it as I can think of better ways to waste 50 bucks."
3,TOO SHORT & THEY NEED A SEQUEL?,"First of all, I'd like to say that this is a great game. The game is suspenseful, making you watch your back at first, until you realize nobody will come up behind you. The most difficult mission is the mission with the train (a lot of grenades thrown at you). But, the game is too easy, WAY too short (I finished it in 2 days, and I'm not a hardcore gamer), and the ending leaves you with a cliffhanger, so they'd better make a sequel or NOBODY will be happy. MOH: Rising Sun has decent graphics, but nothing special. They have a major clipping problem, too. The best parts of the game are the Pearl Harbor mission and the letters from home. This is the first MOH console game with that feature. However, that doesn't make up for the price. I'm a loyal MOH fan, but this game is worth $30 max."
2,dissapointed,"ok i thought this game was gonna be da bomb, but just to make sure i rented it before i bought it and that was a good move! i finished the whole freakin thing in like 5 hours, so then i played multiplayer with my bro and finished it in less time! the other medal of honors were atleast 10 missions this one was 5! i dont know what ea was thinking! well this more a game to rent than to buy! but there were some cool parts but nothing great! if u really want this game wait until its cheaper!"
4,Good game,"A gamer from Rivendelle, LOOSEN UP! And Pete Robinson from Greentown, PA , you have no idea about what your saying about the Japanese, they weren't all as ""stupid"" as you make them out to be.It's a game, good graphics and sound, fun, somewhat educational,SOMEWHAT(just so people don't say I'm taking it too far). The Japanese should be a little bit smarter though, and the game longer."
3,M_O_N_O_T_O_N_O_U_S,"Spending fifty duckets on this game is like paying three bucks to play an old school Pac-Man game, once! Boo to EA for creating such a short game that is monotonous to say the least. The levels are too long, the enemy is too stupid. Is there even anything good to say about this game.... long pause....... oh I guess you could say that killing Japs this time instead of Nazis is cool????"
2,Disappointing..........,"I totally agree with Philthadelphia's review above. When you play this and the credits roll, you won't believe it. I thought ""Interesting that the credits are in the middle"". NO! It's actually the end!If you have never played the other MOH games, go buy them. They're great. And you can probably get both of them for the price of this one.If EA thinks that this is going to get me to buy the sequel, they have a lot to learn--a total ripoff."
4,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS SHORT IT IS LIKE NINE 15 MINUTE MISSIONS. DON'T BUY IT RENT IT!!! iT SHOULD COST $20 NOT !50, THE GAME DESPERATLY NEEDS TO BE LONGER. I THINK THEIR WILL BE A SEQUAL TO CONCLUDEWHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLAYERS BROTHER. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,good game,"Ok, first off i was reading someone elses review and they had said how boring the end of the game is, how you defeat a carrier and the credits roll, are you kidding me in medol of honor frontline you beat the end guy whatever his name is and the plane flys off and it says victory? and your tellng me that is a cool ending to the game? i would by far rather see an air craft blow up than see a plane fly off with the words vicory, give me a break that is the most pathetic ending ive seen, so to you who are giving all the hype to the first medol of honor and how it was so great and the ending is by far better, you better beat frontline again to refresh your memory cause you obviously dont remember how it ends!!!"
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!!,"MOH Rising Sun is a HUGE disappointment. After playing the opening attack on Pearl Harbor level I turned it off it was so aweful. The game play is tedious, unimaginative, and boring!!! Spend your money on SOCOM 2, a much much much better game."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"I am so disgusted with this game that I refuse to even see it to the end...WHAT A WASTE OF $50. If you have this game, do yourself a favor and trade it in ASAP. Get yourself a real game. I will not even bother commenting on the game play cuz I think most of the guys here did a great job of describing it. Just do yourself a favour and let that god-forsaken game collect dust on the shelf. The creators of this game should be ashamed of themselves!!"
4,Frontline IS WAY BETTER,"...1.compared to frontline the graphics are pretty bad.2.i beat this game is 3 hours.3.the only thing you do is shoot people.4.its easy,for instense i let a japan shoot me then i sit there he takes an hour to reload i could shoot a million people before he takes another shot.5.hear rumors about multiplayer and online,well multiplayer stinks because its only a challenge against your friend and the guns stink.And for online better but still very unintense and bad.6.the funnest thing is the begining:shooting down planes.7.last but not least,there are no challenging parts in this game all it is is shoot japs and a couple tanks.in frontline there were guys with bazookas(none in rise of sun), better tanks,way better grenades,nazis actually threw the nades,and more variety of nazis that shot at you like shiefs."
4,Great Buy,"There is nothing more gutwrenching than seeing the Arizona jump up into the sky, and turn over onto its side and sink. There's flak, guns blazing, and Zeros flying all over the place. They try to make you feel what it was like to be in the battle of Pearl Harbor. They add confusion, mixed emotions, etc.The multiplayer is quite fun. They're up to 4 ""real"" players, and you can have up to, I believe 10-12 bots or so. I'd highly recommend this one to your list to buy."
2,it sucked!,"the graphics were the same as frontline, the levels were to short and it was to easy. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
4,Awesome Game!,This is an awesome game! I like everything about it exept that there are not enough saving points. One other thing I don't like about it is that there is not enough health containers.
5,I have some questions???,"I have some questions about this game. Ok I plan to buy it as soon as it comes out and wanted to know about playing it and other games online. Im going to buy the Online Pack for online play and i wasnt sure if it mattered if i had dail-up? I also wanted to know if i was to buy the Logitech USB Headset for Ps2 Online play, would that work with Megal of Honor: Rising Sun, Socom 1 and 2, and other online games, or is there a better headset that i should buy. If anyone can help me out please email me at da_hulkster@hotmail.com. Thanks. Im not really 1, i didnt want to have to fill out a bunch of stupid forms."
3,Expecting more,"I loved the first Medal of Honor and I was loving this game until.....I realized the AI was really off and too easy. Not only that but the weapons selection was much less than frontline assault. My biggest problem with this game is the fact that it is way too short. I finished it in two days. That is ridiculous. I would say rent it, don't buy it."
1,Where's the beef,"I can't give this game much credit, with the exception of the audio. The game is very short. Six hours on an FPS is laughable. Half of that prblem is the AI. I don't know about you, but when I need to reload I try to take cover. Instead ""they"" go to an open area, stop, then start reloading. That isn't AI at all. The walking fungus in Mario was smarter.The weapon selection is a bit on the short side. I know it took place in WWII. I also know there was more than FIVE guns (a fire extinguisher doesn't count). Yeah, I can mount guns. They look a little different, but feel the same. Sorry.I might be too critical of this game because of anticipation, or maybe the game was over-hyped. I gave it a chance, and I was let down.P.S. There is always XIII"
2,What the hell?,"ook.First off, this game has about 1,000 problems, I don't know here to begin, so I'm not. I'm just going to say, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you are a hardcore Medal of honor fan or something.I mean God, they got lazy when making this game. The only thing good (besides a few other things) is the Guadalcanal mission.So save your money and buy Pacific Assault next year."
4,Good- but too short and too easy,"ok, this game to me is very cool, as at the beggining you get to shoot down Zeros, cool graphics at the beggining and great sounds.i bought the game for 30 and so far i think it was worth the money. i bought it 3 days ago and im already on the 7th level.The japs are un-real, they run up to you and swing their sword at you, pull put a grenade and blow their heads off :)WEll, your team mates are stupid, The japs will control a built to the ground machine gun miles away. and your team mates would just stand there and shoot wi th a pistol. silly.great weapons, but you only get to use like 3 of them in 1 level so you do get bored of them. MOH frontline was good, but i think this beats it by a whisker :)multiplayer! good old multiplayer! 2 players - GREAT! 4 - players - you need glasses, the crosshairs are so small you need to be like 5cm away from the screen. i havn't played it online, and im not going to.i think, you should buy it, not sure? rent it then buy it :)"
4,BOOOOOOOO!!!!!!,"What a let down! I'd have to say most of the other reviews point out all the faults. I would not buy this game...borrow it from a friend, or rent it. The fact it takes 2 shots (or more) to kill an enemy is ridiculous. The game is way to short and easy... EA obviously took advantage of all the buyers of the original by releasing this half assed version."
1,Short and Boring,"Just like Frontline, but at least Frontline had a redeeming first level, D-Day in dolby digital. But after that the game got bad. Mainly due to the fact that they pumped you up so well with the first mission, and then the rest of the game was quiet and slow.And, they continued the quiet and slow theme. Overall, even multiplayer doesn't redeem this game, too few people playing together, no co-op, nothing...Don't waste your money.Also, to kyle on this page with the big long review, there is no D-Day because A: it was in Frontlineand B: This is the pacific theater, not the European. D-Day took place on the shores of France, no where near the pacific islands that this game takes place in."
2,Medal of Honor: Rising Sun,"This game was a big flop!!! It did not live up to Frontline. The enemies are truely idiotic. They will do suicidal charges, which are really annoying.You also have to shoot several times before they die.The graphics look pretty pathetic. They look like stinking stagesets and the trees look 2-D or paper like.However the missions that deal with Pearl Harbor are amazing. They feel so real. You even can shoot down planes!"
3,Wait for the fervor to die....,"The Medal Of Honor series is the best historical game series on the market. From the experience I got from playing MOH: Frontline, I didn't think twice about buying this game. Unfortunately, I should've waited.While the game was fun to play, it was incredibly short. The only bright side to the game is unlocking the historical and interview videos. They provided some insight and background information about the Pacific theater of WWII, but it wasn't enough to fulfill the FPS player inside of me. There is a deathmatch style setup and a co-op option which didn't seem fitting for this game.I wish they spent more time and research into building a FPS storyline as intense as they're previous games. I shouldn't be able to finish a game of this caliber over the course of one weekend.Bottom line... It's worth playing, but not for full price."
2,Not worth the money,"I would wait for this game to go down in price to $20. It took an honest 9 hours to pass, and the ending was terrible, you would think that since the last one came out, it would take longer to pass. Best bet would be to go and rent the game for a rew days and not waste the 40 extra it would take to buy it, unless of course you enjoy playing and passing games mulitple times."
4,Lots of fun for an afficionado,"This wig comes packed flat in a plastic bag and must be washed and styled to get full volume. However, for the price, this wig is awesome and has a built-in lift chamber to support the bouffant. I would definitely purchase again!"
4,"Well written, lacks in some areas.","Hingley's book is short and to the point. The overview of the development of Russia's Nihilist movement is sufficient. However, while focusing on the plight and evolution of the movement, Hingley fails to mention some situations in the political sphere that could aid the reader's understanding concerning both cause and consequence of the autocracy's and rebel groups' actions. The book is very well written, and Hingley's dry humor is impeccable. Overall it is a very good read, but should perhaps be read along with other assessments of Alexander II's reign."
5,Great compact,"I am such a huge Jack fan that I would love to get anything that had Jack on it, regardless what it is. I got this item to get free shipping on something else, as it was just a few bucks to get me to my goal. I LOVE this stuff and will be buying another one just to have on hand. The lip gloss is sparkley, but doesnt go on that way. The compact is a little tricky to open, but its fine. Great little compact!"
1,don't order,"Wish I could have used it, but by the time it arrived, and it took weeks, it was moldy on every piece. You would think that if someone knows it will take a long time to arrive they would seal food stuffs better so that that didn't happen."
3,Nice spoon rest if it arrives in one piece,"My first spoon rest arrived in pieces. When I spoke with Amazon customer service, I told them the packaging was bad, so they did a good job wrapping the spoon rest for a replacement. It arrived in one piece, and I have no complaints."
2,Bad design.,"I prefer my spoons to stand upright. Many of my spoons fall out of this one, I guess it depends on your shape of the spoon."
2,Regret the buy,"The product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided. Much smaller than anticipated, I can only fit a tablespoon in it."
3,It's functional and attractive...but,"When I saw this sitting on a shelf at a local store, I knew it would look perfect in my kitchen! And it does...and I don't necessarily regret purchasing it, but it DOES wobble (like others have pointed out). It's oddly shaped, and I find myself spending WAY too much time trying to balance my spoon on this rest, only to have it fall off and dirty the stove. I won't through it out or anything because I do like it, I just wish it worked as well as it looked."
3,Pretty but wobbly,"It works but it wobbles. Next time, I'll look for something a bit flatter and more stable. No complaints about the color though. It is very attractive."
5,Very nice and for a great price,I bought this for myself after not being happy with the options and prices in stores. It's a very nice piece and looks great on my stove while also serving a purpose.
1,Not a fan,I have had this for a year or two and I am online searching for a new spoon rest. It looks nice but anything larger than a soup spoon falls off of it. I use a lot of different sized spoons when cooking and I am constantly grabbing a small plate to use instead.
4,"railing flower pot holder,black",I needed flower pot holders for the railing on my front porch. I wanted something secure but would not hurt the finish of the railing. So far they are working just great.
1,SKIN OIL,I USED THIS PRODUCT AND IT BROKE ME OUT REALLY REALLY BAD. THIS PRODUCT MADE MY SKIN ITCHY. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
2,cool but nonsense,Game is cool but some stuff complicated and dont make sense. I should have passed on this one.
2,"NO, JUST NO","The name ""Gary Grigsby"" sold this game for me. I gotta say this is just not up to my expectations. I cut my teeth on ""War in Russia,"" way back when. I'd play WIR(if I had a copy) over this any day. Contrary to many reviews, I found this game overly simplistic. It's on too grand a scale. Time passes away in huge chunks. Before I know it, it's 1945 and I never feel like I've accomplished anything, even though I may have reach a goal."
4,GG:World at War...fun game!,"I enjoy this game. It's put together well, and presents me with a challenge I can relish. Worth buying!"
5,Renews the genre of wargames,"This game is the best strategic war game to come out in the last 20 years. On the surface it looks like Axis and Allies but that is only in the way checkers looks like chess.The game has an in-depth supply system, realistic research rules, amphibious landings, op-fire, Artillery, AAA, and strategic movement. All of that and the entire WWII can be played out in under 4 hours.The game comes with an excellent 128 page manual and a good community forum at the Matrixgames website. After playing the tutorials for 20 minutes I felt confident that I knew all the basic requirements for movement and combat then quickly got crushed by the AI. This is a game that takes minutes to learn and hours to master."
2,"Too rigid, too complicated","This game is enormously overrated. First of all, you have to have the time and the energy to master the complexities of the rules. Then you are pretty much limited in what you can do in terms of winning the game. There is apparently only one major way (with minor variations) to win as Germany, for example, and you have to be able to figure out the formula for doing so. Once you do that, there's nothing left to do for the next game. You've passed the test; now you can graduate. That's what it feels like. So you're hemmed in by the complexity and the rigidity of the game. It really isn't a great deal of fun."
5,A beautiful recording,"This is one of my favorite CD's for setting a mood of peace and joy. It's pure solo guitar, beautifully played. A mix of classical, spiritual and hymnal music that shares a Christian theme. For anyone with a Christian background (and positive associations with it), this CD is a sure winner. For others it might lack some of the glow, but it's still lovely peaceful music."
5,Thank you,Batonga was the first international song that got me hooked to all international music...because of this song I have since expanding my foreign music collection a lot...Logozo is very soothing and all songs give you feeling of present-day Africa.
4,A Cute Big Unicorn,"This is a nice snuggly stuffed toy. The horn and the hoofs of the unicorn are made from a shiny material, but are not hard or scratchy. It was not quite as big as I expected, but still is a good size."
3,Its OK,"A lot of what's in here is common knowledge but it has come in handy a few times on rarely used ingredients. If you have the space for another cookbook, I'd say get it."
5,A Great Addition to a C ookbook Collection,"This book not only has the standard (stock for wine, etc.) but equivilant pan sizes and a fund of helpful, useful information. A great book for even the most advanced cook."
3,"""Substitutions Bible""","This door stop of a book is ""comprehensive"". It's comprehensive in many ways that are good and in some ways that make it irritating. For example, many of are of no real relevance to most cooks, or necessary (e.g. Piloncillo: substitute = jaggery; mallet: substitute = hammer). Because it is already thick with irrelevant entries it has worked hard to avoid double entries even when they make sense (for example: looking up ""condensed milk"" you are asked to look under ""milk, condensed"". Why not weed out the less useful references?"
2,NOT very practrical AT ALL,"Most of the time, the substitute ingredients the book suggests are harder to find than the one I don't have at hand at the moment. Therefore, it just makes cooking-time longer - you know, you have to stop whatever you're doing to look up the book, etc, only to find that you don't have the substitues either. Nowadays, I even don't bother."
4,"It's good, but watch out for the resistance.","I used this epoxy to make connections on solar cells. It works, which is more than can be said for cheap carbon-based conductive adhesives. Watch out for the resistance, though. It adds up when you have a bunch of low-voltage, high-amperage connections, and you lose power.Slow cure time (days to full strength) is also an issue."
4,"Looks cool, works well","If mercury is called ""quicksilver"", this stuff should be called ""freezing silver"". One contact for my car's rear window defroster fell off. You cannot just solder to a window because it will crack, so I was looking for something I could do without heating up the window. I was worried that the epoxy wouldn't conduct well enough to go inline with the 10 heating wires.It's pretty stuff -- similar products say they are 80% silver, and it looks like this one is too. It starts out thin but if you alternately stir and wait it will reach a thicker but workable consistency pretty soon. I had no trouble, and my rear defroster is working great now."
3,"The lotion can, apparently, get old.","We bought some boxes of these Kleenex Aloe & Lotion Tissues at Target and loved them; I guess they were 'fresh' boxes of this tissue. When I ordered them on-line, the box looked the same, but the actual tissues were not soft anymore. So, the only thing I can figure is that they are old and the lotion must have dried up. Now we have 10 boxes to use up... oh, goodie!"
2,Wrong cable,They sent me the wrong cable. It only outputs sound to one ear of the headphones per plug...
1,"Didn't work, and wasn't black","First, the jacks didn't work correctly. When I pushed the headphone cable in all the way, the sound was in one speaker at a very low volume. Pulling it out just a little made it work as desired, but then you can't move! Also, the description says black and so is the picture, but what I got has red and white jacks. I've returned them."
1,"Doesn't duplicate sound, rather, combines/splits channels","This cable doesn't do what its supposed to do. What it is supposed to do is replicate audio from the female to the male jacks (or vice versa), without any alteration. This cable may be useful to some people wishing to combine 2 mono signals into a stereo signal, or split a stereo signal into 2 mono signals, but that's not in the description. Its a waste of money, and at the price it is, its difficult to justify the return process."
5,Apricot Jell-O,"We live just northwest of Houston. When I asked about getting this flavor of Jell-O at our local stores(even Wal-Mart!), I was told that even if they could get this flavor, it would be a long process.I got on the internet and had the Jell-O delivered within a week.For my needs, the availability of the product was my most important situation. The product itself was excellent and gave my salad the flavor that I was after.Thank you very much,Linda Mitchell"
2,Bad marketing decision,"It was a terrible marketing decision to use the Bach Cello Suites as a filler for the other modernistic pieces that they were coupled with in this ECM New Series featuring Thomas Demenga. The liner notes go to great lengths to sell the buyer on the ties that bind the Bach to the 20th century composers but it sounds more like begging than explaining. The Zimmerman, the Hosokawa, Yun, Verese, Holliger and Carter pieces need to be collected together on a series of recordings and the Bach either jettisoned or sequestered. Maybe someday a re-release will save what's good about this series and reduce 6 mediocre CD recordings down to what should be 3."
5,As close to angels as you can get on Christmas...,"...or any time of the year. If you would like to have angels all year round, then listen to this all year round! Its to beautiful to only listen to around Christmas time!"
1,Disappointing,"This book was a total disappointment and I wish I had looked it over right after I got it but I have a bad habit of not opening boxes right away (in fact, sometimes it takes months or years to get to things - I don't know why I do that). I should have sent it back. I put it in the garage sale and nobody wanted it. It was full of mostly unnecessary or inapplicable details you would only want to fill out if you had nothing better to do. Maybe if you were starting out with a new home you could tolerate it but you'd only use a fraction ot it. And the pages were difficult to turn and organize. I hate it and it is now in the donation box for the thrift store."
5,Wonderful!!!,"The very good thing about this book now is that people who are just buying it to read can also buy the first one, On the Way to Heaven, and then read them back to back. That's good, because when you finish On the Way to Heaven, you have enjoyed it so much you don't want it to end. I know I didn't. I'm not saying it left you up in the air, because it didn't. This author is just so good, you want more. I think we book addicts are a greedy lot. Take my word. Read both of these."
2,Does NOT work.,"This game is the victim of extremely poor netcode. There is a 20% chance of getting into a 2v2 game in Free Mode, and close to 0% in Campaign mode. It is supposed to support 5v5, but no one in the US has been able to come close to that. My connection is a 2mb DL/512k UL.Capcom & Microsoft are playing the blame game, and the customers are left out to dry. I recommend getting something else until (or if) these issues are fixed. It's really a shame - the game itself is outstanding. If you can't play an online-only game online...what good is it?!"
1,waste of time,"Xbox live, which is required to play this multiplayer only game, doesn't support it anymore. No point in buying it."
4,THE LAST HUNT.,"I FIRST READ THIS BOOK IN 1955, AND THOUGHT THIS COULD BE MADE INTO A GOOD MOVIE, WHICH EVENTUALLY WAS, AND BECAME ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITES,BOOK,MOVIE, AND DELL COMIC.THE STORY ABOUT BUFFALO HUNTERS IS GRIPPING,AND THE MOVIE WITH ROBERT TAYLOR, STEWART GRANGER, REALLY WAS A MOVIE AHEAD OF ITS TIME.(I WISH THEY WOULD RELEASE IT ON DVD)CAN RECOMMEND THIS BOOK IF YOU'RE A WESTERN FAN."
3,buy beware.,"Capcom, they gave us the genre known as Survivor Horror. If you have played any of the previous RE titles(game cube), such as Remake, then your used to the entire ordeal of making antidote and what not. This game is awesome! But buy only if you have not played and beaten it on the other systems, cause it runs the exact same, even still, you should buy it for the ultimate Resident evil collection. It is a great series but no true plot twist, wait till the end of this year for part four that will be you best bet."
4,A wonderfully fun game,"This game is fun just like all Resident Evil games. If you liked the others, you'll like this one too. A must play for a Resident Evil fan."
1,"Same Game for $39.99, No Way!!",Do not buy this unless you want to pay more for the same PS2 Title.There is nothing different in GC Version.Do not buy!!
1,I hated it!!!!,"This game sucked, bottom line. I bought it ""used"" from Gamestop and talked my way into returning it so that I can get something better for my hard earned money. The cut scenes are so cheesy (who's with me in saying that this Anime crap has gotten out of hand already?) and the controls are too annoying to get used to. Silent Hill games are so much better than Resident Evil games."
3,great except for flavor and sodium,This casein works how it is suppose to keeping you full and minimizing catabolism at night. It also has a lot of sodium compared to cytosport's complete casein. The flavor is a little on the chemical side. I prefer the Chocolate Gold Standard Casein over the vanilla (and ususally don't prefer chocolate anything).
1,Not good for anyone with lactose intolerance.,"This brand makes stomache hurt unfortunately. The other brand (Cytosport Complete Casin) doesn't taste as good but it certainly beats having to camp out in el baño after drinking my morning shake.My brother is a dietitian and he suggested that I start to use casein protein instead of soy protein which is ""not a complete protein."" He was completely right; I used to feel hungry maybe 30 min after the soy protein shake while the casein keeps me going all morning. It's just that this brand isn't good for my lactose intolerance. Oh well! Live and learn."
4,Pattern to love,"I just love this book, pattern from old days and nice crocheting. Each pattern is marked with skills level. I'm sure you also will learn to love this book."
4,Blue Ribbon Crochet,The item arrived in a timely manner and condition was as described. Will be back to purchase other items.Brenda Jones
2,Handle broke off,Disappointing. The handle broke off. Their warranty is useless as you have to had remembered to save receipt and warranty paperwork. Sheezz...My cheap-o 10yr old carry ons are still going stronger than this 3yr old one!
2,Pull handle wont extend,The pull handle on the 20 in carry on will not extend! Only used five or six times ......sometimes also very difficult to retract handle.
4,Great little carry-on,"This is a perfect carry-on for those who travel light on a plane and check-in luggage. The XCase rolls quietly and stores in overhead bins with ease. If it had two handles, I could ride my laptop on it, but its hard with one handle. Other than that, perfect!"
2,Fragile,"Yes it's light but at a price. We have 4 pieces of Hey's luggage and over the course of 3 flights in one year 3 out of the 4 pieces have broken. We wrote off the first incident as rough handling on behalf of the airline. The retracting handle was bent, kinked and unable to retract. Second incident was a huge dent in the corner, and a crack. Now just having returned from another trip, our third piece has had the retracting handle broken. The polycarbonate around the handle shattered, and the mechanism in the handle broken. And yes the polycarbonate looks sharp but is very susceptible to scuffs, scratches and marking so don't expect your shiny new luggage to look that way for long.If you really need ultra lightweight luggage this may be the way to go but the trade off is too large for me, what's the point of lightweight if it cannot stand up to the rigors of travel? 3/4 over 3 trips is just too high of a fail rate."
5,LOVE Crocodile Creek,"I just bought a dozen various crocodile creek placemats for my boys; 2-5yrs. I chose crocodile creek because my eldest had their planet one for the last two years. After daily use it's ready to surrender, although not in horrible shape. The images are wonderful. The only complaint is that they are so wonderful the boys want to move their food over to look at the graphics. Just wipe them clean, they will last. No scrubbies though because you will scratch the surface, and the graphics."
3,"Good placemat, wish it stuck to the stable better",We use this placemat everyday. It's easy to clean and our toddler loves it. Our only issue with it is that it slides very easily along the table surface. This can lead to some serious messes. Wish it had a little more stability or a bottom that gripped the table a little better.
2,pictures flake off,horrible quality - love the animals.might try to get it laminated as it was SO SO expensive for a place mat!
2,This is a placemat?,"It is just a piece of sheet plastic. I thought placemats had to have some sort of texture on the back so that it sticks a bit to tables. Similar to suction cups, if you get what I'm saying. I mean, my cats placemats have that! This moves about all over the place. What is the point of that? I feel it was overpriced, but I guess I will use it. I am ... disappointed. Maybe I should have just got a cat placemat."
5,A Great Product!!!!!!,I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has allergies. These tissues are strong yet very soft to the touch. I love the fact that this product does not contain any lotions due to the fact that less is more when you have allergies.CA
3,I felt this was an ordinary facial tissue. ...,"I felt this was an ordinary facial tissue. For bad colds or allergies, I'd probably buy a stronger tissue. However, these are fine for """"every day"""" usage. This tissue is an """"in-between"""" tissue -- better than generic brands, but not as good as the lotion-treated and stronger """"cold"""" tissues."
2,Not Useful,"I cannot say I loved First Aid for STEP 1, but I do think it contain good information and I feel I did well on the exam because of it. This First Aid is so overly simplistic (and mind you, I like simple) that I do not feel like it contained any of the shelf exam questions."
3,FA Surgery,"This book isn't really that good. Buy it if you like but I don't strongly recommend it, it's too big and not well written."
5,"great, fast service",The book was as described. Fast service. The packaging box was the right size. I had a good experience with this order.
3,Very detailed,"At least half this book is exactly the same as First Aid for the Medicine Clerkship, but it does a good job of describing pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and surgical management of issues. It's helpful that it includes chapters on the various surgical subspecialties.I wouldn't say that it is particularly high yield because it's over 500 pages. It would be the most helpful to someone who hasn't already had their medicine clerkship."
4,Really Helpful,"It's a lot of help while you're going through your surgery rotation. As much as I would have liked to have read the text book, there isn't a lot of time due to the long hours of work. This book helps fill in the gaps. Some things might be too simplified, so it might be helpful to supplement with the required books."
1,Don't buy for the kindle...,"The formatting that is used in the kindle version is terrible; please don't waste your money, because the book ends up being more confusing than helpful. I can't comment on content, because I've given up reading it on the kindle after about thirty pages."
3,S/M Inaccurate,"I have an expanded chest size of 39"" which I determined the S/M 35"" - 40"" size would fit. When I received the product it was labeled simply as a Small and even the invoice listed it as a small 35.25"" - 37.5"". The product seemed to be of good quality but obviously too small for me. I have requested to either return the product for a Medium or a refund but have not heard back yet."
5,Very effective at positioning the shoulder in the right place.,The product literature talks a lot about how effective it is at wicking away sweat. Nevertheless with any heat or movement you will get quite sweaty.
1,WTF? This thing is worthless.,It bunches up when you raise your arm. It does nothing. Don't waste your money. Keep looking for something else.
4,Pretty good,"I'm not the biggest fan of the country genre. It doesn't appeal to me that much because of the things I find kind of stupid that are associated with country music. I was pretty excited to hear that Me First was going to cover some country songs.I hand't heard of alot of the songs they covered here. It starts off fantastic with a cover of Garth Brooks Much to Young to Feel this Damn old. I loved this song. Desperado is pretty good as is the cover of On The Road Again.It's a very short album clocking out at around a half an hour. I find myself listening to it again. I love the first six songs more than the rest. This is not the best album they've made of cover songs. I like Blowing in the Wind and Are A Drag the best. This album though is a nice funny poke at country music. If you have any of there albums you won't be disappointed. It's a fun album. I wouldn't call it a must own, but you shouldn't be disappointed by it."
4,Sector9 Horseshoe,"I bought this longboard about 2 months ago in our local skateshop, bc i needed a medium to get me to university, shopping etc...I was used to usual skateboards, but after like 10 minutes of riding this longboard you won't want to change...it has a very soft flex, riding it almost feels like riding deep powder, and is very agile.The perfect board to ride around the campus, as long as you don't go faster than 40-45 km/h (it's too soft for high speeds)"
5,Lonesome Dove Soundtrack,"The music of the Lonesome Dove motion picture is permanently recorded in our minds bringing to our memories the characters and their character. Each stirring sound brings to my mind the memories of those men in my life who were of the character, determination, and integrity that Gus and Call represent in this movie. I enjoy the music every day and thank God I have known men such as these in real life. A truly great movie and soundtrack that is without equal including Gone with the Wind.CR"
5,Masterpiece,"Such a masterpiece - how could anyone not like this series? The characters, the actors, the scenic beauty, the compelling story, AND the best TV series music soundtrack EVER. It made me want to drive to the Rio Grande River near Laredo and follow the route of the cattle drive north to Montana just so I might catch some of the magic. A Masterpiece."
5,A fantastic movie soundtrack!,"As far as movie soundtracks go, the ""Lonesome Dove"" soundtrack is my favorite. It is wonderfully orchestrated with all of the music you were used to hearing while watching this multi-award winning movie. If you loved the movie as I did, then this soundtrack is perfect for you. From the opening number to the last, this soundtrack will take you back to the movie event called ""Lonesome Dove""."
5,"I love this soundtrack, very emotional.","I've read the book, and the first time I listened to the soundtrack, I almost cried. It sounds really stupid, but this soundtrack is the absoulute best soundtrack for any movie. I would recommend the movie, Lonesome Dove."
5,Time for the complete score,"Now that the greatest western ever made has been digitally remastered ( for picture and sound on dvd & blu-ray ) it's way past time that the COMPLETE magnificent score by the late great Basil Poledouris should be given the same sound remastering & restoration on cd . The existing cd is only a taste of all the terrific music written for the film . I implore whoever owns the rights to the score to give it the 2 or 3 disc release this outstanding music has long deserved . I'm far from the only fan who feels this way , so it would likely be a financially sound move on the part of the company which owns the rights . Please release all of this wonderful soundtrack !"
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE,"This is my favorite movie of all time. The casting was perfect for each character played in this movie. I couldnt make this movie more perfect than it was already made. Like i said the this is the best movie that has ever been made, and i have seen alot of movies."
4,Dont Cry for me Minnesota,"1972: Drat! We have Nixon AND resurgent Nazi sleeper cells here and around the globe? John Cooper is recently divorced and eking out an AA-assisted writer's existence in Cambridge, MA when he receives a cryptic telegram from his elder brother, who is inexplicably in Buenos Aires:""URGENT YOU MEET ME COOPER'S FALLS 20 JANUARY. DROP EVERYTHING. FAMILY TREE NEEDS ATTENTION. CHEERS OLD BOY. CYRIL.""So home to the family namesake Cooper's Falls, Mn goes John Cooper. This Ludlum-esque page-turner had me as soon as John Cooper's Lincoln swung northward in Chicago and headed on the long ago familiar Illinois Tollroad trip towards home in Minnesota - with a stop at ""one of the Fred Harvey emporiums."" Almost run off the road near Madison in a blizzard, John goes home to revisit old family secrets. Then round and round the globe he goes, where it stops only author Thomas Gifford knows. I was up all night following the intrigue!"
4,Complex and involving,"The Wind Chill Factor isn't necessarily an easy book to read. The plot is complex and if you don't keep up with the different twists, it would be easy to get lost in the details. However, this is absolutely one of the most richly written books I've ever read. The sensations the lead character experience become the reader's sensations; his thoughts, your thoughts. Once you commit your energy to the story, you'll be hard pressed to put the book down until you are finished."
3,I guess if you like Tord Gustavson,"I'm crazy about Tomasz Stanko, Keith Jarrett, and ECM in general, but like Tord Gustavsen's Being There, I'm not moved by this. It's as if it's trying too hard to be ethereal and beautiful. Maybe someday I'll see something in it that I don't see now, as I did with Paul Motian Trio."
4,The series just keeps on getting better and better,"The seventh and final book of the Jonathan Argyll series by Iain Pears comes after his success with the complex historical thriller 'An Instance Of The Fingerpost', a book totally different from these art mysteries, and far more ambitious. This is not to say that the Jonathan Argyll series is not excellent: it, in fact, keeps getting better and better. Weaving a traditional flair for crime writing with considerable knowledge of the history of art, Pears writes an effortlessly intriguing mystery.This particular volume takes a turn when it appears that Flavia's boss, General Bottando, may be involved in the latest art crime swindle himself. The book is not predictable and keeps you guessing and is very enjoyable if not as spellbindingly clever as 'An Instance of The Fingerpost'. Well worth as read."
3,The Immaculate Deception is Neither,"One gets the sense that Pears has tired of Jonathan Argyle and his rather overblown worship of connoisseurship. Still, the machinations of Italian politics ring true and some of Pears' character sketches shine brilliantly."
3,Solid but I expect more from this series,"Love this series and development of characters, which played out well enough with a major development in this book but I found the political intrigue part of the book uninteresting. Not that it was not done well, just that it was not my taste and I do like the way Pears is moving the characters along in life stages. Everything was sound and fun but uninspired, except for last chapter which was brilliant. Character study rescues book IMO, and I rate it the second worst in the series to The Bernini Bust but still a full notch above most cozy mysteries. This is a great series though, with every book worth reading and if spaced out it feels like you are returning to old friends on reading."
3,"Excellent book, except for multiple blank pages","Concur with previous reviewers on the importance of this author and the usefulness of this abridgment. Unfortunately, numerous blank pages in the middle of the volume interrupted the flow of the narrative while increasing this reader's irritation. I shall pursue efforts to locate a complete version and satisfy my interest in the subject. Note the 3 stars: the book deserves 5, the seller much less."
3,NOT BAD BUT NOT GOOD EITHER,"THIS IS A BOOK BY GEORGE PLIMPTON WHO WRITES ABOUT SPORTING EVENTS THAT HE COMPETES IN AGAINST A PROFESSIONAL TEAM OR INDIVIDUAL. THIS COVERS PITCHING TO AN ALL STAR LINE UP FROM THE NATIONAL AND AMERICAN LEAGUE. I REALLY WANTED TO READ MORE ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS AND RESULTS DURING HIS ATTEMPT TO PITCH TO THESE MAJOR LEAGUERS, INSTEAD HE TELLS US OF HIS STRUGGLE TO FIND A GLOVE, A UNIFORM AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS THAT LEFT ME QUITE BORED. ONCE THE BOOK GOT GOING IT WAS OK BUT IF YOU CAN STAY UP LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE IT TO THE SECOND HALF OF THIS BOOK IT IS ENTERTAINING. I FOUND PAPER LION AND OPEN NET TO BE ALOT BETTER THAN THIS OK READ."
4,An interesting look into a NFL training camp in the late 50s,"This book was about a journalist, George Plimpton, working for S.I. He joins the Detroit Lions training camp and becomes one of them. It is an interesting story with many stories from many famous players including Johnny Unitas and ""Night Train"" Lane.With some humor, Plimpton sacrificed his body and time for a great, well written book"
4,Hall of Fame Game,"Tiger Woods Pga Tour 2004 is the one of the best sports games ever made. It has tons of game modes that are all 100% fun, while also challenging the gamer. At first Tiger woods PGA Tour 2004 is hard to get used to, but after a few rounds of 18 you will be having so much fun you can't stop. The rewards you can earn are unbelievable. EA Sports definetly shot a hole in one with this game."
1,Bogey,"Players are not different enough cause you only get Tiger.I dislike how putting is done.Too many arcade elements for a ""sim"" game.CPU AI is not worth playing against."
5,tiger woods vs ernie els,"this is just a survey to see which player is concidered better by the general public... if you think tiger is better then click, NO, on, was this review helpful...if you think ernie is better then click, YES. be honest. i say ernie because hes more consistent but tiger, when in the zone, is unbeatable. lets see what the public thinks...oh and about this game...i havent got it but ive heard goods things. im getting it off amazon."
3,"Good enhancements overall, tour play too easy","Many of the game enhancements are very good, such as more PGA players, courses, and items to purchase with prize money. The graphics and sound are as good as TW 2003, and the player customization is a fantastic new feature.One big DOWNSIDE of TW 2004 is the the lack of difficulty in the PGA tour gameplay. I won the first 4-round tournament that I played (Hawaii), despite not building up the attributes of my player. And after the first round of the second tournament I played (Arizona), I shot a 12-under par in the first round, to lead the tournament by 10 strokes! So clearly, the PGA tour mode seems too easy, and I am hoping that the difficulty level increases as the season progresses..."
4,"cheat code = "" THEKITCHENSINK"" to unlock all","This game is good but 2005 is better. There is much more stuff to buy in 2005. Beleive me I wouldnt steer you wrong. Get the 2005. 2006 sucks, they put the shape stick in it for that year and it sucks rel bad , dont buy it. I am a TGW expert. I play it all the time."
4,Addictive,"If you have 2003 and enjoyed it, get 2004 because it's even better. Graphics, music, and realism are first rate. You'll laugh when your hands start sweating on the world tour and you have to remind yourself it's only a game.New features include - real time events, new courses with interesting designs, custom player design, sponsorships that allow you to earn extra $ on your PGA Tour, new and challenging scenarios, the introduction of a modest level of strategy that's required in the early going, new game modes (single and multiplayer) and tracking Tiger trophies.Tracking Tiger offers a deeper appreciation for just how good Tiger Woods is. The number of firsts, records and $ he's earned on real courses is amazing and difficult to beat even in the virtual world.Necessary improvements (if anyone at EASports reads this) PLEASE1. Include a wider range of comments from the announcers, they get sooooo lame.2. Speed up game play significantly by loading more than one hole at a time."
4,Very good golf game,This is so much better than mario golf and other cheesy golf games because it uses the analog sticks to swing. Character customozation is very good and has a lot of new things. Many courses and scenarios. The graphics aren't much better than the 2003 version and the whole game isn't much different than the last game that you could get for $20 instead of $50.
5,acid jazz era,"If you are looking for the best acid jazz collection in the market ,then this is the one availiable for everybody to cover almost everything from a great era( 1998-96)"
3,"Sure it's a cheap T.V. movie, but at 10 years old it sacred the ........","This is yet another of those late night movies that I watched growing up(with every light that I could turned on and feet firmly on the couch) and when I found this one for a dollar I grabed it up. I must say that it's not as good as I thought it was, but I had fun watching it again and yes I kept my feet on the couch."
1,god awful movie,Tarantula Has got to be one of the worst creepy crawler movie ever made.Now if you get creeped out from seeing a much of spiders crawling around then this movie is for you. But other then that this movie sucksssss.This is more of a suspense movie then horror.The worst part of this movie is the dramatic ending which never came.All the victims die in the first half of the movie and that all.And the fatal spider bite scenes are just brutal to watch.
4,This is not different from other products in ...,"This is not different from other products in its use, but it looks different in its appearance. It's attractive."
2,Nowhere near 8000 hours.,These bulbs last a lot less than 8000 hours. I put 8 of them in my bathroom about 18 months ago. They are on a maximum of 4 hours a day. 6 of the 8 bulbs have burned out already. Two are still soldiering on.
4,Watch Band for Seiko Monster,"This is a nice, solid band. It is slightly different than the band that originally came with the Monster with the main difference being that the rubber is a little stiffer. The bars came with the band and were a good fit. My only complaint, and it is a small one, is that the holes are slightly different than the spacing on the Monster. This creates a little looser (or tighter) fit than I'd prefer, but is no deal breaker. Good for the price."
3,Band is great but did not include the springs like the item said it would,This is a great quality watch band and fits my Seiko black monster perfectly. Arrived in a clear plastic bag and not the one shown in the advertisement and without the band springs. I just wish the springs would have been included like they were supposed to be.
1,Band is OK but no spring bars !!!,The band did not come with the two (2) spring bars that the description claims. Looks like this is not the first as other reviewers complained about the missing spring bars. I needed to order the spring bars separately resulting in extra cost and delay. The spring bars should be removed from the Product Features as they are not included with the band !!!!!!!
3,Seiko dive band,"This band is very comfortable and rugged. I have a large wrist, and most watch bands don't fit me comfortable. This one is more than long enough. And I think it looks cool.*** Update on 9/30/11. After three years, the band cracked and broke. I really liked it up until that point. I have heard that this is about how long these Seiko bands last before breaking. Maybe it is a necessary trade-off that comes with good quality rubber, but I really don't know. If a three year life is ok with you, this is a great band. But I lowered it to three stars, because three years seems awfully short to me."
1,Fake Item,"This is NOT an original band. Even several items in the picture can be identified as NOT the original as they are advertising. On the origial Z20, the loop around the buckel end that holds the excess is square. The original Z20 is rounded on the top and bottom. And, they are not even advertising the correct band in the picture. They are showing a 22mm band, when it should be the 20mm."
3,Got the job done,"It was difficult to fine a correct band for my Seiko Kinetic Dive Watch. No band description identified it for this watch. I had returned a stainless steel band because of pin location in the band which made it not fit. The same problem was true of the rubber watch band. However by cutting the side notches with a razor blade, I could make it fit correctly. So yes, I am pleased with it even if it had to be retrofitted."
1,Not original,"About all I can say is I got this item quickly. When cross-referencing with a website to verify if this item was legit, I found it wasn't although advertised as ""Original"".I'll be shipping this item back for a refund."
3,An African adventure novel,"This is my first Wilbur Smith book. I think the book is pretty good. There are some great scenes, such as the battles in the desert, the lives of the tribes, the elephant hunting, etc. The siege of Khartoum is vividly described. However, the protagonists, both British and Arabs, are quite flat and their relationships seem bizzare. The last 200 pages of the book are very weak.This book is not as good as I expected. However, I think I'll try some more books by the same author."
2,OK for a plane flight,"Not bad for killing time on a long flight, but the characters are odd. Just when you think one might start to come alive, he/she is dropped for a hundred pages and never brought back convincingly. I finished the book without ever once caring about any of the characters. If I had anything else to do or anywhere else to go, I would never have finished the book...which would have been a bonus, since the last half has no purpose."
5,This book was for a prisoner in Texas,This book was a gift for a prisoner in Texas so I did not read it myself but my friend said he enjoyed it very much.
4,Fascinating story but enough with the sex descriptions.,"Both my wife and I love reading Smith's tales of Africa, but in this book he seemed to go beyond the norm in describing the sex scenes, mainly of the character Rebecca, who like her dead mother is an absolute twit. It is a shame, because the story is so gripping. Then you get to the sex scenes. After the first two descriptions, I would just fast forward to where the story started up again. It was like watching tv and viewing a commercial you had seen too many times. We started to wonder if Smith is actually a closet romance novelist.In summary, excellent story about the time period and good insight into the Arab mindset. But, give it a rest on your sexual fantasies."
2,Book was not like new. Damaged on arrival.,"The book did not arrive as advertised. Unfortunately the spine was broken. The book is definetly readable, but we tend to pass the Wilbur Smith books around the house as 2 or 3 of us really enjoy this author. It is going to be pretty ragged after it makes the rounds."
4,A Rousing Action Adventure ...But ...,"I am far from as negative about this book as the other reviewers, but the gratuitous and explicit sex scenes do detract from what would otherwise be an excellent action adventure story. (When I have to think about passing this one on to my mid -30's son, you may get the picture.)The novel is set in the Sudan in the late 19th century and revolves around the fall of Khartoum and the British re-conquest of the area. It is replete with battles, sword fighting and ... sex. Yet, despite my sense that the latter is a bit overdone and distractive from the plot, this is still a good bit of historical/action fiction."
1,horrible crap,"this is a dreadful book just full of trite prose and macho stupidity. i can't believe he has written numerous books and the idiot public bought this junk. bad guys are always geting run through and having their eyeballs plucked out, and this must appeal to the twelve year old set. don't buy this book but rent 'gladiator' a few times. just dreadful junk. i thought i might learn something about the sudan, it being in the news these days, but his references to towns and terrain can't be found on the map on the frontice piece. waste of time.david"
2,not one of Wilbur Smith's best efforts,"I agree with most of the reviewers , this is certainly a very pathetic work of literature by an author that i have always held in high esteem . I have read and reread every one his previous books , but never felt so badly as this one .this book failed to evoke any excitement , a lot of the outcome seem to have been a foregone conclusion . there really was no great climax and the surprises were really nasty ones .I dont think this book will endear this author to his demanding readers ."
3,Solid enjoyable read,"I re-read this book for the third time in preparation for the follow on novel Assegai.My initial assessments were confirmed. It is an enjoyable book, and a good read as always. But I feel one of the main characters, Ryder Courtenay was underwritten, and another main character Penrod Ballantyne wasn't all that likable. Plus the first 2 years in the book took 80%, and the last 10-20 years 20%, so it felt rushed towards the end, more like a history lesson than a work of fiction.But it is still a deeply immersive story about a corner of the world whose history most of us would know little about."
3,Well written,This is a Historical fiction of the Holy War between Egyptians and Arabs in Cairo during 1884. I think that this book was well written at first I was apprehensive about this book because the description on the back does not do it justice. The love scenes are a bit redundant but this does not affected the enjoyment of this book.
4,A Terrific Read for Summer and the Election Season,"Shakedown Beach has it all: mobsters, crooked politicians, a true 21st Century Femme Fatale, and-- just for good measure-- a former pro wrestler turned private eye that might just be Dezenhall's best character yet!Character development really is Dezenhall's strength... he captures everything that's good and bad in human nature, adds a touch of ""Jersey"" and mixes it all together to form a cast so real that you will feel like you are literally ""down the shore"" as they say in the Garden State.This book belongs on anyone's summer reading list, and what a great primer for the upcoming election season!"
2,Diapointing and not much depth,"Professor Lieberman has indeed as one other reviewer said a very loudmouth narration. He basically visits some of the tourist sites and have his guides and some other people give comments on Myanmar. While he parrots the state department and keeps calling it Burma.I have been to Myanmar many times in the past 10 years and have spoken with many people there, this documentary has absolutely no depth to it and outside of a travel catalog has not much value."
5,Fantastic!,"We just returned from a trip to Burma and this movie captures the essence of the people and country. Although, now that the sanctions have been lifted and the government has opened up, things are much better."
3,I expected more,"Having visited Burma many years ago in the 70's not long after its borders we're reopened tourism, I looked forward to this movie. While it provides helpful information about what has happened in Burma across the last 40 years, to me it lacked a cohesive message."
4,Burma Today,"Very interesting.....so little is known about current conditions. A little too dark, and would have liked to see more of this country."
4,Excellent Work - Classic Zimmer,"Zimmer and Campbell are two of the finest comparative mythologists in print. This book, edited by Campbell from notes and articles written by Zimmer, provides a great overview on the symbology and mythology of tranformation, the soul, and purgation. The book, a series of myths and legends with observations and commentary by Zimmer, covers the landscape of both Eastern (Indian & Arab) as well as Western (Arthurian) myth - and discusses the parallels of each. Well worth the read, and a must have in any collection."
5,The King and the Corpse,"I usually don't read mythology books straight through, rather use them as reference. As such this book is easy to use. With Joseph Campbell as the editor I feel assured that it is a good rendition of the myths. I found it relevant to specific images I wanted to learn about. Excellent addition to my ""images"" library."
4,good webcam,This is the first webcam I ever owned and it does what it is designed to do with no problems what so ever.
4,Velcro...,VELCRO - what else needs to be said. It holds cords in a nice way and its black... they go with everything.
1,It's deceiptive,"Shame on me, I ordered this product without reading the reviews. I was looking for a pack of stronger ties, and sorely disappointed when the item arrived.I didn't return it. It's not worth the effort. Hopefully I would learn a lesson."
4,good album but not as good as first,this is an underatted band. i like how is has its own sound no trying to sound like other bands. i saw them play at michigan state university and they were awsome. if you want some good rock go buy this album.
2,Disappointing....,"This CD blows. That's all there is to it. I was expecting American Hi-Fi's second CD to evolve much like Incubus did in their second album, Make Yourself, but I was dead wrong. ""Flavor of the Week"" was just another bubble-gum punk song, and ""The Art of Losing"" is no different. Am I really supposed to believe that just because there's swearing in this album the band has grown up?? Gimme a break. This band should change its name to American Douchebags. Grow up, you little punks. Seriously. If you want to hear an amazing second album, go pick up Vs. by Pearl Jam or the aforementioned Make Yourself."
5,best new cd of the year,"This new American Hi-Fi album is in some ways a lot like their debut, but in a lot of ather ways its very different. It has more of a garrage rock sound to it and it is far more cutting edge than their first. Ive been going to sleep and waking up with this cd for almost two weeks now and i still love it. I waited 4 months for this cd to come out when i first heard that they were working on a new album. And it was well worth the wait. so please buy this cd, you wont regret it."
5,Best Album Of The Year?,"The Art Of Losing by American Hi-Fi is definately the best album so far this year by any means...the lyrics are great, and the music is awesome...all in all, a killer cd...go pick it up"
4,art of losing (import,"This album is pretty cool, it isn't all the same, It has songs with acoustic guitar songs and mostly eletric guitar songs, it even keeps the pop punk in the acoustic songs. If you like bands like sum 41 and green day, you'll love this, so go and buy this cd if you like pop punk"
5,Buy This CD - It's Awesome!,The Art Of Losing is better than their self titled CD. If you don't like it at first listen to it again and I guarantee you'll like it. If you like The All-American Rejects then you'll like this.
1,Not what I expected.,I was expecting to see a list of the song titles and their rank for the week. I was very disappointed with this book.
5,"A seminal classic, twisted and dark. Incomprehensible","Richie Hawtin is responsible for a lot of great mix CDs. Plastikman, his alter-ego, is equally responsible for tons of seminal acid techno tracks. This CD combines the personalities perfectly in a completely infamous, unparalleled mixed.Tracks are split into equally divisible intervals. At the time, properly queueing the tracklist was impossible so dense was his mixing. Maybe that was just superstition, or marketing. Whatever, an urban legend like that pretty much sums up the legacy of this disc.A must have for techno fans. Richie peaking off his early acid days and turning towards something even darker and more minimal that would eventually come to define his sound."
4,Still good after all these years,"I bought this mix at the end of my raver years, and at the time I thought it was a great mix for mellow headphone listening. It's definitely smarter and bigger than your average DJ mix. And it grew on me, and I've listened to it a million times, and I'm not bored yet. I still keep coming back to it. Now that minimal techno is trendy, this mix seems like a classic in the minimal techno canon. It's great for late nights, background music, parties, tripping, working, driving, alien abductions, whatever.Quite frankly, I'm not crazy about Richie Hawtin's recent mixes, and I've found his live sets to be minimal to the point of boring. But this mix is really worth getting. In my opinion, it's his best disc."
1,Waste of time and money,"I have gone to the track casually throughout the years but did not know much about handicapping. I had already read BRad Free's ""Handicappng 101"" and felt ready to buy a couple of more intermediate books. This was one of them. What a waste of money. I don't know if an advanced player can get something out of this but it was just a waste of time, especially for the price. THere is little structure and it's as though someone just felt like jotting down some stuff they do and pass it off as a book. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER!!"
2,Not much there,"Overall an average volume without much that really helped me. I'm not an expert, but I am an experienced handicapper and this just wasn't for me at this point in my experience."
2,Got to agree with Kowloon man,"If you are an experienced handicapper looking for some new ideas, look somewhere else.I live in Seattle and this book will be little help to me."
1,Mine was fake,"Sad, but true. Package was opened. Seller said ""this was to insert the pins"", pure lie. The top opf the package was cut off and pins taped to the package. I checked the marking, the buckle had the wrong marking and font. The look and feel was very cheap. I hade the other band for 5 years. This thing is junk. Wasted almost $30. This is a common problem. Most can't tell. Do your homework. This is why the pins don't work."
4,Why not 5 stars?,"This is exactly what I was looking for to change my Seiko metal band, but the pin diameter that goes into the watch are too large for the watch, so the band just falls off because it isn't set. If I use the original pins with the metal band, the diameter that goes through the rubber band is too small and there is a lot of play and it feels cheap. I haven't done it yet, but a trip to Wal-mart to get new pins might just move this band in to 5 star territory."
3,Just not Gershwin!,"While I think Kiri has a truly incredible voice, I have to say that this album is really quite boring. The songs are lovely, but they lack subtance in the way they are interpreted by the artist. Gershwin, I would suppose, would call for more spark and life; it's just not there. If crossover Kiri is what you are looking for, try her Maori album or ""Magic-Kiri sings Michael Legrand."""
4,Love Kiri's full rich voice,"The instrumental accompaniment is too loud, otherwise 5-stars. If you want only one of this beautiful voice, get Kiri sings Kern."
5,Kiri Sings Gershwin,Kiri Te Kanawa has the best voice that I've ever heard however these versions are operatic rather than emotional and so are for the technical ear rather than for one who listens to musical theatre for therapy or just pure enjoyment.
3,I'd like to introduce you to a genius,"This book is interesting, though some obsevations which Brakhage makes seem either arbitrary or ludicrous. I enjoyed about every other chapter, because the material quickly grew redundant. Brakhage is interesting for a day, and then can easily be brushed aside. If you are looking for a confidence booster as a filmmaker or plain intellectual, than read this book by a so-called genius. It's simplicity will overwhelm you."
5,Great preparation for seminary,"I bought this book as a prerequisite to attending seminary. It was a challenging read, but definitely enlightened me to the church behaviors and attitudes of people born after 1975. I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn about how to approach youth and young adults in the 21st century with regards to church/religion. The author seems to be both knowledgeable and well-educated."
1,Is This Book Christian?,"This book is so misleading that it is hard to call it Christian. It talks about ministries that never existed, like the home for unwed mothers, which the author used to get contributions but never opened. The huge building he talks about opening is still not open eight years later despite the Dream Center accepting millions in contributions. It was Phil Aguilar, not Matt Barnett, who came up with the name Dream Center and created the Adopt-a-Block program (the most important Dream Center program). Aguilar is not even mentioned, though Jan and Paul Crouch have said he was the true pioneer of the Dream Center. Recently the Dream Center has given up on what they started in Los Angeles and is now going to focus on New York City. They have a business relationship with the Unification Church (the Moonies) in New York and intend to have their services in a Unification Church-owned building there."
5,A must for the soul winners,Pastor Matthew wrote a touching and eye opening book about the struggles of starting a church in the inner city. It was great reading and the humily of Pastor Matthew showed through on every page. The LA International Church and the Dream Center Story will expand your own dreams.
5,Simply Perfect,I received the watch band in perfect condition and delivery was incredibly fast. Thank you Amazon and the Seller.
4,"Did its job, for awhile","Worked fine for dusting out my old computer case during a hardware update, but ran out a bit faster than I would have hoped, even considering the small size."
1,Waste of My Time,"What a useless piece of tripe! No doubt that the 4 star ratings came from an all male group. I admit that the soundtrack was great but that is not the reason I watch horror movies. The acting was below par even for a B movie. If refunds are possible, I'd like one!!!"
4,Matt Dean Doesn't Disappoint,"In the rising glut of slasher films and horror mistakes, it's nice to see that filmmaker Matt Dean doesn't disappoint with his new film. Not only does the film pay close attention to detail but the camera work, sound design, music and performances are stand outs in this film which is chock full of what horror fans want to see. Hot girls, scares, good premise and strong direction. Congratulations to Matt and his team!"
4,"Hot girls, pools of blood - a fun teen thriller.","A good film for teen horror film fans. I was happy to see that the cover art was not misleading. Blood, knives and naked girls. Somewhat scary with a decent amount of blood, several amazingly hot girls in the pool, and a few laughs. plus - the ending had a couple of nice surprises. It's not as scary as ""Halloween"" but the ""dance scene"" makes up for it. A good addition to the teen horror/ thriller world."
4,Excellent intellectual history; par for course for Berman,"Paul Berman has written two interesting books in recent years. The first was the excellent TERROR AND LIBERALISM which looked at jihadic violence, its underpinnings in Islamic and Western philosophy and history, and the possibility of a humane, hawkish, antitotalitarian, liberal response to it. POWER AND THE IDEALISTS is an equally engrossing read that looks at the generation of 1968 (anti-Vietnam, anti-authority, anti-capitalist, very often anti-American protesters) and their evolution over time, especially in reaction to Entebbe, Kosovo, and 9/11. Suprisingly, many 1968ers evolved quite far. The emphasis here is on Germany, as the central figure under consideration is former German foreign minister and Green leader Joshka Fischer. This is an excellent, journalistic account of many arguments very pressing in today's political environment. All arguments are treated fairly and in more than just a single dimension."
4,Pro Feet Bodysuit,"Although it is not super stretchy it does move with your body well and is made of durable material. However, the seams are rather lightly stitched and appear to give some with high activity. Other than that, great!"
4,Yellow Bodysuit,"It did fit ok, though just a tad bit big on the bottom, the yellow is definitely more see-through than I expected, but fortunately I'm wearing other things to cover it. Shipped and Arrived quickly."
5,Excellent!!!!!,"This book grabs you from the very first page. I read the entire book in three hours. Kalico deals with issues that every woman can relate to in one way or another. I am suggesting this book to every woman that I know. I hope it inspires them, as much as it has inspired me to start my journey to forgiving myself, as well as forgiving others. I really enjoyed it. I can't wait for part II."
5,Living Life on Life Terms....,"I have had the pleasure of meeting Kalico a few years ago, and I can say she is truly living life on life terms and that is what makes her book, unique and very special and its own little way.I give the book 2 thumbs up, Cant wait for the sequal........... (smile)"
5,When Gucci Came First A Real Attention Grabber,One of my fastest reads ever. Could not waite to find out what came next. Highly recommended. A real survivor can't waite for book two.
5,I want to meet you kalico jones,"When I read this book I was in tears. how could someone go through so much pain and still come out on top? I kept asking myself. This girl, who ever she is, is a strong woman. I am so happy for her and I cannot wait for the next book. I want to know more about kalico jones. this book is right up there with the coldest winter ever and better than true to the game. I could relate to her life, I felt her pain and I enjoyed reading how she overcame all the obstacles in her life and made it to the top. All I can say is this book is really not a five, its a TEN **********!!!! You go GIRL!!!!! I am going to recommend this book to EVERYONE."
4,Great details and realism,"Excellent book. I read it on one night. It kept me interested from beginning to end. I was just a little confused about the timelines, but it satisfied the purpose of inspiring me to continue getting up after all the mistakes and errors of life."
1,horriable,this book took forever to come i will never deal with this company again they are very slowbut the book is a very good book i like the author
5,I LOVED IT,"Kalico, this has to be one of the best books I've ever read. I finished the book in one day. Life has thrown a lot at you. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain, a lot of sadness, a lot of anger. The list goes on. In this book, you're able to tell the truth about the way things were, and thats good because that helps you to become a stronger and healthier human being. I'm glad you and your mother are best of friends and I hope that continues to get better and better everyday. It's wonderful to hear that you have a fantastic relationship with your father, and I bet you are his favorite (girl). Just joking, I'm sure he loves all thirteen of you the same. It really would be a great day when you and your sisters and brothers be united AT THE SAME TIME. This is truly a great book. Kalico jones, I applaud you. GOD BLESS"
1,Just a Cheap Plastic Mask,"The costume itself is okay, but the mask is just cheap plastic with a rubber band to hold in on your head..it broke after my son wore it twice....no its a costume with no mask. Nowhere did this say mask was plastic or I would not have bought it..made it seem like it was fabric like the rest of the costume. This was a big waste of money."
4,Fun for all ages,"This game was based on the 2003 Nascar season, which was the last year it was called ""Winston Cup""....I absolutely love this game. I got a wheel for my pc version, and it is awesome. The two best feature's I think this game has is the number of race tracks to choose from, and being able to pick the best drivers from days of old..I.E. Richard Petty(My Fav. Driver of All Time), the late Great Dale Earnhardt. Although, it is strange seeing a deceased driver on the track. The fantasy courses are really cool, as are the ones you can unlock the better you play. If you want the last year of Winston Cup, this is the game for you."
4,kenyan,i thought the last nascar was great wait until you try this game it blew my world with al the new features a must
4,GREAT GAME but needs improvment,"This game is awsome. it has improved carrer mode,more lightning chalenges and much more. but another new feature the grudes and aliencs feature is really dumb say if you hit someone they hit you back but when they do they slam you which is very unrealistic. overall BUY THIS GAME!"
2,EA Definitely Messed It Up!,"Well, I have to agree with the author that stated EA messed up what used to be a good game. I constantly play Nascar Thunder 2003 and thought that 2004 looked better. WRONG. Granted, the graphics are a lot better, but that's the only thing that has improved. The gameplay has been ruined - the graphics are so overdone that a white ""wall"" of what looked like smoke would appear every so often in the game. Personally, it looks like EA just used the code for the PS1 version of the game and beefed up the graphics. The sound is pathetic - doesn't even sound like a real car like 2003 does. It's also not compatible with the Logitch wheel. The same day I bought my copy I had it up for sale if that tells you anything."
4,Solid book for young math lovers,"This book maybe a little tedious for parents to read to their kids, but my six year old loved it and it made him think about various difficult mathematical concepts (infinity, fractions) in an accessible and fun way. The artwork is detailed and much action is hidden in the pictures for those who look carefully."
5,"A real MATH book, to inspire young readers","My niece is 9 years old. She was reading before going to sleep. The book was so good she wanted to just keep reading, but fell asleep with the book in her hands.A MATH book! When I asked her about it she was really excited, and told me all about the cat, and the various scenarios with numbers, (she talked about zero like a person full of life). So... instead of the same old boring arithmetic, she studies in school... an exciting book that brings the numbers to life, and introduces her to some tough MATH concepts. The Hilbert hotel is one of my favorites, (as a mathematician), and now it is one of hers. Well written, with great illustrations. Please buy this book."
1,unsuitable for any age,"I was really disappointed by this book,and I've never felt the urge to pan another's work before.The author has written some fine books in the past, but this is a tiny production with 60 small pages, including title page, table of contents etc, mostly bizarre drawings (someone must like them, I guess),and mainly large print of such sentences as ""Number One Million Two Hundred Thirty-Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty-Six moves to Room 1,234,567"" which take up a large proportion of the text on some pages. And the single concept of the entire book is Hilbert's hotel with its infinite number of rooms. It seems to be adressed to curious 6-year-olds, but I can't imagine them reading it. Don't buy this book without looking at it closely first. (I am over thirteen! If I were 5 I might have enjoyed the book)."
4,Got to have them!,I purchased these to retrofit a friends older Summit stand. All of my new Summit stands have come with these as standard so they will spoil you. No more trying to fit your boots into webbing straps! They install easily and you just slip your boots up under them and start climbing.
2,"Six months to live, Whitney takes the vacation of her life","Spinster, Whitney Smith is handed a diagnosis of six months to live. She quits her job as librarian, buys a plane ticket for a Caribbean vacation at Dominica. Her seat partner on the plane is Dr. Eric Townsend, vulcanologist flying to Dominica to do research and update his book. Consider it to be instant attraction, but Whitney's early demise may keep them apart. Mallory Rush offers this tale. Love Play"" is a rather ordinary and very light Romance. Ms. Rush has done better."
2,Very simple plot,The characters are unreal and the plot is simple. I don't find the book exciting at all although it is not yet being rated boring.
2,Previous work was better,"I enjoyed Ms. Rush pervious book. Love Games, this one however the place was a bit too slow and the characters a bit unreal. The herorine was a bit too neurotic for my taste and her lover was a little too understanding at times"
1,"Not your rights, it's your children's rights",Just like a lawyer. Just the facts. No heart or soul. No variation from what Attorney Boland is involved with in her day to day practice. This book does nothing to make a very hard problem any easier to handle. No new information.
5,Seasons of our Joy,"A terrific overview of the year in realtion to the Jewish Holidays! The explanations are direct, yet go into the deeper meaning of the holidays and how they relate to the seasons and to history. A great buy for educators wanting to understand the Jewish Holidays."
4,Perfect for summer driving,"I have absolutely totally worn out my audio tape version of this CD. Totally perfect for blasting in your car for all those summer road trips. Believe me , many a time I have pulled up to stop lights to see people in the car next to me jamming along with the music. Long live Chakademus and Pliers."
4,A sample of reggae around the world,"Chaka Demus and Pliers simply put, have their own style. On this album, especially the ""murder she wrote"" song has the reggae beat mostly found in Central American countries like Panama and Honduras...almost unheard of in the western countries. ""Gal Wine"" give that typical reggae offbeat. ""Tease me"" is very interesting, because the reggae seems to flow with their singing as opposed to the background music. There is a great cover of ""Twist and Shout"" and how the Beatles may have done it say if they were from the islands. Give this album a try. I suggest it simply because it's off the beaten track."
4,A for Clarity,"Unlike a good many how-to computer books, this one is clear, easy to follow, and offers some neat little tricks heretofore unknown to a long-time user of the program(Microsoft Publisher). Loaned(pointedly, I suspect)by a supervisor, I shrugged it off for a couple days and then picked it up out of a sense of duty. Soon, it became that evening's bedtime reading-- not for entertainment value, let me hasten to assure-- but for tricks I hadn't known before and refreshment of procedures I had. Incidentally, most of the material applies to MS Publisher 2003, so if you have 2003, it's still worth the price of a clean used copy. I recommend this one."
4,Great book!,Great resource....just in case. Thought this would be great for teaching my grandson a few fun and important skills. Can't beat the info in this book.
5,Uplifting Moral Fiber,"BOY SCOUT HANDBOOK 1967 7TH EDITION 3RD PRINTINGThe text is easy to follow. The illustrations are well done in color. The ideals that it presents are a wonderful reminder of how I grew up, to follow the Scout Law and be kind to others and develope my skills in knot tying, camping and relating to others in a kind and respectful manner. The Scout Handbook that I had when I was a Scout was harder to follow."
3,Not good enough!,"I was a boy scout 30 years ago and loved my scout manual. I don't think this comes even close. Too much fluffy nonsense. There aren't enough pages dedicated to outdoorsmanship. Not enough knot making and trapping in the wild. I can't find the instructions for learning Morse Code, how insane is that."
3,From a Scoutmaster,"Over time, Scout handbooks and requirements have changed. This is not the current edition. this handbook was used until 2011.New rank requirements have been added and some have been modified. Still a great handbook to have in your collection."
5,A Path to Adventure,"Have you ever wanted to learn how to survive the wilderness? Have you ever wondered what adventures lay ahead of you? Find out what's there with the Boy Scout Handbook. The Handbook covers many skills, such as tying knots , and purifying water. The 11th edition Boy Scout Handbook is also much more organized, and durable. For all those scouts out there, this book is for you!"
1,"Oh God, why?","I can't believe I actually decided to buy this game! For a die-hard Bionicle fan, the game is that much more terrible. The acting is bad, the story is inconsistent, random, and doesn't follow the official story, the character designs are ugly, and, most of all, the game is just bad. If you have the money lying around, and have the choice between this game, and a giant, novelty pen, I would buy the pen. Trust me, it's more entertaining. The game is bad, and the developers should feel bad. End of line."
1,No imagination used in the creation of this game,"I got this games for $4.99 and it still was not worth it. It is one of those cheap carbon copy games that simplymaps the Bionicle images on to crappy unimaginative and poorly designed game play. I expected better fromLego, that they would have made an effort to have somebody produce a quality product. The game is short, yet still managesto make itself tedious. Its a minimum effort mass market get it out there quick and milk as much money with the least amountof effort video game that appears so often now. This email took more thought and effort to create than the Bionicle game.It will just frustrate young users and adults who have to play the game for them."
3,Billy hatcher and the giant egg,"(uh) well I gonna say that it a fun game.Well all you do is road a egg,and Do missions like beating a giant dinasuar on the third level dino moutain,and there a battle mode you do eveats with 1 to 2 players and that it the less you figure out, bye, by Tyler Burroughs"
4,Bleh,"Good idea, bad game. I'm a Bionicle fan, so i picked up this game. That was a bad decision on my part. The game only allows the Toa (heros) to play on one level. It's also WAY too easy to die, but even with that fact, I beat this game in a few hours. The only somewhat fun part is the bonus features you can unlock by collecting the way too numerous light crystals. My advice to prospective buyers... wait until another developing company picks up Bionicle."
4,AWSOME!!!!!!!!,"this game is SO COOL! The musics awsome the graphics are good!tahu`s level is so cool kopaka`s is cool too!! i have`nt even finished the game yet but i know its awsome! if your a bioniclefinatic like me and want some bionicle action, buy this game now. its worth every penny.(you won`t be sorry!)"
4,Could have been better,I got this game on christmas day beat it on christmas day so thats 1 day. It had ok graphics no cool combos and IT WAS TO SHORT.Anyway I mean it was a good action/adventure game but you could not be all the Toa and all the Toa Nuva.Also they should of made something where you upgrade your sword.So I guess I say LEGO needs to work on their videogames.So all the really good gamers out there this should be a renter.
4,the greatsest playstasion2 game,.... i like this game if you always wanted to fight the borohk and the kal(borohk kal) or the rahi or rahkshi or the the master of shadows(makuta)(sorry dont battle the borohk queens):-( then this is your game. or mabe you want to be one of the toa. or mabe you just want it because your a bionicle fan. whatever the reason is this is the game for you. though is short and it has no blood but there is no blood because it is against Lego code and the weapons are for focusing thier powers.
1,Profitting Off The Name,"My 9 year old loves Bionicles and was exicited when getting the game. He will tell you that it is cool...but, the graphics are average at best, the game play is relatively easy, and the biggest disappointment is the game is VERY short. We limit daily playing time, and he still beat the game in a few days. For the price this game is a joke, marketed by name not game quality. We are slow to finish most games, but this one was really short. Rent it, and save your cash for a game that deserves it."
4,Good bottle cooler bag,"This bag works pretty well. I would say you can only fit 5 bottles in it side by side but if they are short, you could fit a 6th one across the top. Keeps things cool with the ice packs and has a handy top section for snacks and food."
1,Terrible.,Less than two weeks after receiving the item the zipper has already busted - and I've been using it with only THREE bottles - not even the six that are advertised.
3,Dr. Browns Glass bottles with sleeves,This only fits five (5) Dr. Browns glass bottles (4 oz) with silicone sleeves. I have to angle the 6th bottle at the top over the other bottles. Cannot fit ice pack once all bottles are in place.Does fit six (6) Evenflow (4 oz) bottles with sleeves just fine.Would not purchase this again if offered.
3,Doesn't keep cold but good for transport to sitter,I use this to transport Dr. Brown 8oz bottles. I've put two ice packs and another one in the top compartment and it only seems to keep them cold for 2 or 3 hours. I use them to get to the sitter's and then she removes the bottles and places them in her fridge. I wish this would work for road trips but sadly it doesn't hold up to long rides. A for effort though. I do use this daily.
4,Great cooler bag for baby bottles,"We use this every day to take bottles to daycare. It holds 5 bottles for us -- we are right now packing two 9oz Avent bottles, and three 4oz Avent bottles every day -- so we lay one of the 4oz bottles on it's side. We use this in tandem with the Medela Ice Pack and it works like a charm everyday.The only complaint is that the zippers get stuck once in a while on the puffy white inside linings, but just be mindful so you don't get the zipper stuck or accidentally rip up the white lining/insulation."
3,"not bad, could be better! only one with 2 large compartments","i got this to send my bottles and home-made baby food to daycare in. I love the 2 seperate compartments (I put food and medicine in the top, bottles in the bottom - it holds at least 4 8oz bottles in bottom) but it just doesn't keep the food super cold. That is okay with me because they just put it in the fridge at daycare. The only complaint i have is that the liner in the largest compartment where I store bottles already came apart so that part is no longer spill proof! it serves its purpose, so it really can't be beat for this price...especially since there are no other coolers like this out there."
3,Defective zipper but the bag works well,"I purchased this bag for sending my son's bottles to day care. Luckily, he only needs 5 bottles because there is no way this thing will fit 6 bottles - at least not the full size Dr. Brown's bottles we use. It would be an extreme stretch to fit 6 bottles in it. It works well and keeps the bottles cool though. However, the ice pack does not fit unless you only have 4 bottles inside.My main complaint is the zipper. When I received the item, the zipper was defective and only zips half-way closed. If you pull it further than that, the zipper comes off the ""tracks"". So, I can't close it all the way, but it works for my purposes of taking bottles to day care I guess."
1,CHEAP!!,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND DO NOT BUY THIS BAG. I OPENED THE ITEM AND THE INSIDE IS POORLY MADE! IT LOOKS LIKE I SEWED THE BAG TOGETHER! THIS ITEM SHOULD BE IN THE $.99 CENT STORES.
3,Good quality but never really used it...,"The quality of the cooler is great and I like the top container for the ice pack. I also like that it came with 1 or 2 ice packs. I'm sure this would be great, but since I stopped breastfeeding pretty early and we're all on formula now, we never ended up using this. I may start using it though now what we've moved to solids, for when we're out and about."
5,Almost perfect!,"I use this for 8 oz Dr. Brown's bottles, baby food jars and spoons. It fits 4 Dr. Brown's bottles with caps and the ice pack it came with comfortably. I can fit 2 baby food containers and a spoon on the top compartment. If you remove the ice pack you can get 5 Dr. Brown's bottles but not 6. It works perfect for me since we never need more then 4 bottles a day. Note that this is a large, tall carrier but the only one I have found that holds more then three 8 oz Dr. Brown's bottles and baby food!"
4,Pretty nifty cooler,"I got this cooler to keep my pumped milk in at work. The bag is well made and keep the bottles cool with an ice pack in there. It does not fit well in my Medela breast pump shoulder bag but I can squeeze it. Usually I just leave the breast pump bag unzipped. I can see how the cooler will be very handle to send to daycare when we have 8 oz bottles and solids to send as there is a nice second area for small things. Overall it gets the job done, I just wish it fit better in the breast pump bag."
5,So far so good,"I bought this bag to transport 4 glass bottles with silicone wraps (Evenflo). It's got enough space for the four bottles and an ice pack to sit next to them. The price is great and I like the upper compartment for food containers. A great, no frills bottle bag.**Update 8.5 months later** This is a tough little bag! No rips & has gone through almost daily use w/ all sorts of thing being crammed in there from daycare. This bag lasted months longer than a Dr. Brown's bag. This will most likely be retired as a lunch bag for my daughter."
4,Full Throttle,"This CD contains everything from slower ballads to straight-out hard rock, with even a little pinch of country thrown in (in Don't Know a Thing About Me). It also contains some insightful lyrics, though much of it is rather enigmatic and therefore escapes comprehension. Karloff's voice blends perfectly with the distorted guitars and the fine riffs, and the whole disc is well executed. You will most certainly enjoy listening to this in your car - or on your bike..."
4,Disappointed,"I bought this for my niece as well, I have fond memories of reading Judy Blume especially ""Are You there God it me Margret"" and ""Blubber"" The problem is I only received one book I waited a couple days and nothing so I sent it back."
3,Misleading Title,"This book has a lot of information about feminism, and a lot of information about Christianity, but no ""feminist interpretation of the Bible"". It is very dry, and appropriate for those readers who have a deep interest in feminist theory. I was expecting an analysis of the Bible from a feminist point of view, and was disappointed."
1,Not even the real artists!,"I bought this CD on sale from 10 dollars! And the regular price (according to this site) is only a measly 5 bucks. I come home, ready to listen to some awesome songs by the REAL artists, but they obviously have to hire fakes (it's one girl singing all of the hits) to sing the best songs that were good the first time, when they were sung by the ORIGINAL and TRUE artists. I gave this one star because that's the lowest rating you could put on this worthless CD!"
5,Perfect for Parents,"Dr. Callard-Szulgit's book provides helpful insights into raising perfectionist children. Often an ignored topic in educational literature, it is something that many parents have to deal with, but few know where to turn. This book is one of the places where they can."
2,Very disappointing...,"Thus far I have found Dr. Callard-Szulgit's book very disappointing. It is filled with self-promotion (there is a reference to buy her ""other"" book in almost every chapter) and random anecdotes about her own life, but very little tangible information to help its readers. It almost seems as though she's using the pages as personal therapy. Don't be fooled by the number of pages listed for the book either--many of them are taken up by exceedingly similar (and some are actually repeated) one-cell ""comics""; when you take away the blank pages and other wasted space, there is very little written material in this book. Even then, much of it is regurgitated information from other quoted sources. If you really want to read this book, borrow it from your local library or university, as I did. Dr. Callard-Szulgit claims to be a recovering perfectionist, but there is nothing ""perfectionist"" about this disappointing piece of work."
4,Helpful for our neurotic little Johnny.,"Many helpful tips and tricks to help a single dad (me) raise my bright, gifted, yet neurotic little guy. Thanks. Looking forward to the next publication."
1,Very basic introduction to perfectionism in gifted children,"If you have no familiarity with the concept of perfectionism and how it manifests itself in gifted children, this book will provide you a rudimentary introduction. The author provides no substantive ideas for managing or reducing the impacts of perfectionism. One Chapter, The Positives of Perfection, is literally two pages, one which is just a non-illustrative cartoon and the other says ""nothing"" in 11 languages. Find a better book if you are interested in dealing with the problem."
5,"Poultry Standard Books, Both Bantam & Standard","I have read, and Own SEVERAL Poultry Standard Books. They are ECXELLENT reference materials for the Poultry fancier*They offer guidelines as to what is good, and what not to buy. If you are considering Purebred Poultry, this is the set of Books to own!They are detailed descriptions as to combs,Colors,Size, Type,condition, What to Cull and what to Breed.A MUST HAVE Book"
1,Bitter disappointment...,"Despite looking forward to this game's release for a long time (like many rugby fans), this is, with the best will in the world, a total waste of time.My primary reaction is that this is unlike any other EA Sports game I can think of. The basic hallmarks of an EA game are not there - graphics, animation, gameplay.It's a pity because the game had promised so much - and in terms of having the licenses, teams, players etc it is a fantastic update of the first rugby game. Unfortunately it is unbearable to play. The players look wrong and move unnaturally. The control system is frustrating. It is hard to co-ordinate your team. I could go on.I'm sure with some more time, this could have been an excellent rugby game. My view is that it has probably been rushed through to be in the shops in time for the world cup.Here's hoping that EA will be back with a decent stab at a rugby game in the not too distant future. My advice would be to wait, and not waste your cash on this."
1,EA Rugby 2004,"I really enjoyed EA's last rugby game despite its limitations, particularly the lack of teams and competitions. Consequently, I was really looking forward to this one. What a joke. This game is truly unplayable. I thought I was missing something because I could never get going in this game despite being very proficient in the last one. Then I read the reviews and realized that I wasn't alone in my dismay. I just wish I would have seen them before I purchased it. What a waste of money. I would have thought that a next generation game would be superior to its predecessor but this seems like a version made in the Pong era.Don't buy."
1,The worst sports game ever,"Lets face it - the game of rugby is quick and intuative - not so this neolithic piece of software. Jonah Lomu rugby from Codemasters was a much more playable game if a little unrealistic - this is just tedious, tedious etc. The joy of quick passes is impossible and it just is so unlike the real game as to offend. I can handle the graphics being as poor as they are if there was a tiny bit of gameplay there - but no. I will be taking my copy back as they have forgotten to put a game of any form in it. Stick to the football and golf games, theres more fun to be had watching Bristol play than play this."
2,Don't bother,"I went to the store to get Tiger Wood's 2004 but I saw this game and decided to get it seeing as how much I like rugby. This game isn't playable. It bites. And the worst part is, I can't return it. Do not waste your time on this cheap looking cheap playing piece of worthless crap."
1,Poor Show,In this day and age you'd expect a game within this costing bracket to have a better interface and functionality. Probably rushed through to coincide with the end of the World Cup.
1,Quite possibly the worst game I have ever played,"What the hell was EA's budget for this game?,by the quality of the game id say about five bucks.I dont even know where to start about how bad this game is, so I wont......AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!"
1,awful piece of coasterware,"Shame on EA sports for rushing this awful game out when they had a perfectly good rugby game in Rugby 2000 and all they needed was to tweak that. Instead they went with an all-new engine, which is riddled with flaws, such as the inability to pick up the ball in open play without starting a ruck, the near impossibility of kicking while running, and the all-too-easy conversion kicks. There's a whole laundry list of errors that make the game unplayable. Get Rugby, the first PS2 game instead. It is MUCH,MUCH better than this piece of trash."
3,"Smells Great, but...","This product smells fantastic! I agree with the previous reviews it is watery and that makes it difficut to evenly distribute the product onto your hair. I like the previous suggestion of using a spray bottle, perhaps I would have given this product a 5 star rating if it came packacked that way. Perfect for fine dry hair in between shampoos."
1,A disappoinment,"My hair is relaxed, and I was thoroughly disappointed with this CD product. My hair was left tangled and the smell is overwhelming. I like the Khoret Amen line much better. Unlike the results from the black vanilla leave-in conditioner, my hair was no more thangled than ususal and I was not overwhelmed by the scent. I enjoyed the herbaceous, floral, and refreshing scent. This is my hair ritual: deep cleasing shampoo, Khoret Amen shampoo, Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and Carol's Daughter hair milk. The results were smooth, soft, manageable, and great smelling hair."
1,Absolutely terrible product.,This product leaves your hair greasy and frizzy all at the same time! What a mess! I have used 1.99 conditioners that work better. I doubt this company will be around much longer after seeing so many negative reviews on so many of its products. Don't waste your money on the Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner.
2,Disappointing,"I have to admit I'm a total sucker when it comes to advertising. That's why I fell for this product. When i first tried to buy it, it was out of stock everywhere I looked. As soon as it came back in stock on the Carol's Daughter website, I jumped at the chance to buy this.TOTAL RIP OFF! All it basically is, is water with great-smelling essential oils. Not worth the money. It did nothing to moisturize my hair, and is only useful as a perfume. Whatever, I can use the hair balm for that.Save your money and spend it on something that actually does condition the hair. Neutrogena Triple Moisture's leave in conditioner is great. Paul Mitchell, Reddken, etc."
3,"Did nothing for my hair, but smells nice","I would not recommend this product if you have dry hair in need of a moisturing or restorative conditioner. Granted it smells nice, but that's about it. It is very watery and has no conditioning properties, that I could detect. Not a great value, in my opinion, and I am willing to pay more for products that work well."
2,So-so,"Well I used this conditioner right after the mint shampoo and it's not the best detangler for my hair, (thick curly and crazy). I'm so used to thick creamy conditioners like Pantene, etc, that this light spray conditioner didn't really seem to do much for me. I need something thicker so maybe I will look into other Carol's Daughter products. As for the vanilla smell it's too strong for me, but not altogether too unpleasant. It works great on my kid's hair, though they have finer curls."
2,doesn't condition well,I purchased the Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla leave in with the Rosemary Mint shampoo for dry hair. Very disappointed with both products. This one doesn't condition my hair which needs a lot of taming before leaving the house. Something that is creamy would probably have been better. I also found the shampoo SUPER drying. It stripped my hair which is not good for hair that's already dry.
5,LOVE IT,"i love each and every one of the songs on the album. i kept playing it over and over again, almost ruin the CD. she stayed true to her African soul and that is what music is about, staying true to your roots."
5,Excellent Music.,"I have no clue what the language is. But one thing is for sure. The singer has proved that, music knows No language or national barriers. Angelique Kodjo jas surely won my heart with her captivating music. Her music can also be seen and heard on WNVC 56 in the Washington Metro area on Friday nights at 10."
3,Not really hands on information,"If you have been trained in Harners core shamanism or something similar i don't think that this book will give you anything to help you on your journeying. My two takeaway from the book were:How in traditional society the shaman was gravely ill and went o journeying to recover and then was transformed and became a shaman.How shamans (both men and women) transformed sexually into becoming - womanly men or manly women, in some cases men dressing in woman's cloths and that homosexuals, transvestites and hermaphrodites combining masculine and feminine characteristics, which helped develop a heightened sensitivity for their environment themselves and their inner strengths and energiesHe points out that as a rule the psychically conspicuous, the most sensitive the loners are the ones chosen for shamanic training.You may or may not find this comforting."
3,Beginner's book,"A bit disappointing, though there is certainly a ton of information in the book. Probably a more suitable beginner's book, and less for someone who has been devouring and researching for years now. I enjoyed his other book more, personally."
3,Needs an Update,"Arabic has a particularly rich store of proverbs, and this is a well-laid-out introduction to some of them. However, the proverbs were collected in the 19th century and they have not been updated, so this book is more useful to people interested in literary Arabic than those who want to speak it. Also, the title is a bit misleading, since only Egyptian proverbs are included. the book is well organized, and I especially appreciated that it has the Arabic script as well as a transcription.What is really remarkable is that this is the most updated and complete collection available. An updated and expanded version would be an essential purchase for any student of Arabic."
2,NYDJ not so hot,"I bought a pair of NYDJ (Not Your Daughter's Jeans) after reading a very complimentary article about them in Reader's Digest. I ordered a petite size, as I usually wear petite jeans. They were too long and I had to shorten them. The thighs are nicely snug, not too tight, but the torso is so loose I can pull them on and off with the zipper and button closed. This is certainly not what I expected from $94.00 jeans! My Lee Riders from Walmart at about $20 fit me better. What a disappointment!"
2,Not the same size as store bought,"I love these jeans and wanted another pair. I tracked down the exact size and style number on Amazon and bought them. Even though all the numbers were correct, the pants were too small and I had to return them. Deducted from my refund was shipping and handling. I'll not buy jeans again without trying them on in person before purchase"
5,These Are The Most Comfortable And Best Fitting Jeans Ever!,"I just got my Not Your Daughter's Jeans today and after putting them on, I want more of them. They feel luxurious, much like the $$$ ones I bought once in another brand. They move with me and smooth out some areas that needed it. I really do look thinner, at least in places.Cons: I am 5'1 and they are just a tiny bit too long. That's not a big deal though.Did I say they are comfortable?! They are."
1,Dubious authenticity and wrong fit,"I purchased a pair of size 6p Bootleg ""Not your daughter's jeans"". I have a pair already and they are a perfect fit. They arrived, and I tried them on but they were a bit tight. On further examination of the Jeans, the stitching around the ""Not your daughter's jeans"" label was a bit untidy and, underneath that label was another label showing size to be 4p, not the 6p ordered.It makes me think the jeans are not authentic. I think the store should send me the correct authentic sixe 6p as ordered at their expense and have the others uplifted, again at their expense. Very unhappy, and am still waiting for a response from the store with their comments."
1,Omega Paw Couch Protector,"This cat scratch post was flimsy. It did not stand up by itself; I had to pick up the chair it was supposed to protect and put a leg down on the base of the scratch post. When my cats stood up to scratch on it, the thing still bent over. My chair has become the preferred object to scratch. I got rid of this scratch post."
3,Pretty Good Cat Scratching Post,"The post is pretty good. The only complaint is that it tips over REALLY easily. If the cat's nails catch on it, it will tip right over."
1,Not very Sturdy,"The 1st time on of my cats went to scratch it it fell over.and no one has gone near it since. If the legs on your furniture are over 2"" high this probably wont work. I almost bought 2 of them I am glad I didnot"
4,uneven beads,"The beads are not perfectly shaped. This wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that the silver flower holder on top and the bottom of the bead emphasize the asymmetry. Despite this, they are still pretty, especially for this price."
4,PatiL,Look prettier in the picture on line. Looks a little inexpensive but still pretty. Was going to give as gift but since it looks a little like costume jewelry...but pretty will keep for myself.
4,Lovely gift,"The earrings are very neat, lovely as a gift for a teen or older. Pretty marbelised kind of finish in green."
5,A pleasantly elegant pair of earrings,"I really didn't expect the quality of these earrings to be as high as it is. The workmanship is very good, the beads are beautiful, and I'm very pleased I bought them, especially for the price."
4,Nicer than expected,"Bought these for my daughter for Christmas, disappointed that I did not buy them for ME!"
4,very pretty,These earrings came as described and are very pretty. I gave them as a Christmas gift and they were a hit.
2,Didn't work out,Hello. This was a gift but she said they stuck out way too far from her ear lobes to wear them. Of course she would not return them because they were a gift.
4,Lots of promise...,"This book holds out a promise of healing a wide variety of ailments and improving health overall. After following the guidelines for a few days I noticed major improvement in energy levels and digestion. Problems that had plagued me for years were gone after just a few days. I would suggest trying this approach if you're interested in healthier living... not just trying to drop some pounds. It offers many combinations of foods, and steers clear of fads. The recipes were not too appealing - the core value of this book is the explanation of how to combine foods for health.A small complaint - I must admit I was distracted by the professionalism of the writing. Multiple typos?! It may sound like a nitpick but it made me question the author//publisher just a little. I have recommended this book to friends and family, with the caveat that the quality of the text should not detract from the message... (but would hope future printings could deal with this)"
2,FRUSTRATED,"I felt very frustrated too, with the sloppy index at the back where so many things are not where they say they are!!! Also, I have GAINED weight on this diet and my arthritis is not improved."
3,SIMPLE and SATISFYING,"This book gave easy to understand information and instructions on how to eat for healthy digestion. The typos and grammatical errors were annoying, but the substance of the book rang true for me."
4,Beautiful Hymns to Positive Thinking,"Some great stuff from the ska and rocksteady era by Desmond Dekker and the Aces. This is some really great stuff. Obviously influenced, as were most Jamaican groups of the era (1960s), by Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. Many of these tunes such as It Pays, Keep a Cool head, Unity (the inspiration for Queen Latifah's early 1990s hit), and Young Generation, sound like upbeat hymns to positive thinking, with the Aces providing lovely background harmony to Desmond's lead and the backing of Beverly's All Stars. Of course there is also the classic ""007"" which is easily available elsewhere, but it certainly belongs on this collection. Good intro to Jamaican music immediately prior to what we now know as reggae. Enjoy some easy skanking with this."
5,Flexi Giant Leash,This is the best leash for big dogs. It allows you to handle them close up and the full 26 feet away. It has a stronger mechanism that the older units. It has a positive stop gear system that is better than the friction one they used in the past. It also has a more open lead containment area so it stays cleaner and dryer when the lead is collected. Large handle is great for people with large hands. A good addition to the product would be a flasher on the back for those of us who have to walk at night. Great product.
3,"Passive Writing, Aggressive Subject","First off, I love Barbra Streisand. She is an electrifying, complex, multi-talented woman with incredible drive and tremendous style. And, like many women, she is abrasive, needy, egomaniacal, picky, and prone to anxieties and self doubt. That's pretty much why I admire her--she's so much like me, except, of course, she can sing, act, make movies, write songs, and so on!As much as I enjoyed reading this book, the first Streisand bio I've read, I found the writing itself rather lacking. Over and over the author explains and re-explains Streisand's need for motherly approval, her urge to become famous to prove wrong anyone who ever said she wasn't attractive enough for stardom. The author's passive writing style sometimes literally put me to sleep: ""The star-lit night was warm."" Oh, please!So, while I did like finding out details about one of my favorite performers, I felt the text could have used a good editor's touch."
3,"A very good, and intimate portrait of Barbra Streisand","I really enjoyed reading this book about Barbra. I was getting to the end of the book, and I was thinking, ""this book has been fab!"" But the end of the book was all about how difficult Barbra was to work with in The Mirror Has Two Faces. Not a nice way to end a book. The majority of people who are going to read this book are Streisand fans, and we don't want an ending like this, do we?"
2,More fear and paranoia,"Art Bell and Whitley Strieber have bought the philosophy of Global Warming hook line and sinker.The eruption of Mount Saint Helens did more damage to the environment than all of mans affect in thousands of years of using fossil fuels.There appears to be a warming trend, but appearances can be deceiving. Asphalt or concrete parking lots and highways, and brick or concrete buildings create a heat sink effect. they absorb heat from the Sun, and release the energy after the sun sets. With urban sprawl, and the interstate highway system they are encroaching on the weather stations set up by the NWS (National Weather System), and these stations are providing faulty readings.If you have questions or comments; E-mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
1,Keep your night job!,"Baloney does not stick to paper very well. Not since Joseph Goebbels and the ""big lie"" has there been such a gaseous expulsion of fairy tales masquerading as science. Beam me up Scotty!"
1,Great Entertainment - Pure Science Nonsense,Great fun to read... but scientifically it's all hot gas.
1,Bad! Bad! Bad! and Bad!,It's just an expanded version of a Globe or National Enquirer short --- soooo stupid.
2,Poppycock,"My apologies to my friend Art Bell, but this book is pure poppycock. Entertaining, but poppycock."
3,Good as entertainment only,"Makes for good entertaining reading, but like the movie Day After Tomorrow, just be sure not to take it too seriously, as the authors have no real scientific credentials to speak of. Frankly, anyone who would actually seriously believe Whitley Streiber's material probably thinks that The X-Files is a documentary series."
1,Very interesting but................,I am glad I borrowed the book instead of buying it. The authors substantiate nothing. This book should be put on a shelf labeled Speculative Fiction.
1,Infuriating,"The authors say themselves they are not scientists. So why is there no bibliography to support their case? There isn't even sufficient internal citation. I would estimate that they cited a source only 10 times in the entire book. As it is severely lacking supporting evidence, can any person possibly listen to what these two men have to say?The book itself was terrible. Taken purely on a fictional basis, I would still give this book one star. The book is filled with glaring grammatical and stylistic mistakes that are not acceptable in a published work such as this.The book is also infuriatingly repetitive. The authors run out of material around page 100 and resort to beating their point into the ground for the next 186 pages. In all honesty, I do not recall a single new idea presented after the 100 page mark.I was very disappointed with this book and do not recommend it, unless you decide to read only the first 100 pages and conduct your own research."
4,Do not judge the messengers,I admit Bell and Whitley are flaky but did you read Discover amagazine's Oct. 2002 articel on how global warming could lead to a new Ice Age? The famous Woods Hole Institute is not flaky and they confirm Bell's findingsThe book needs a Bibliography and detailed footnotes and source references. But this is not to be ridiculed.
2,Where is the nearest library?,"Being a storm lover, I eagerly anticipated receiving and reading this book. I was not disappointed in the sections describing ""The Storm"". But, the balance of the book (unfortunately the majority) was not fulfilling. After reading many other reviews of Bell's literary attempts, I must agree that the fictional narratives come off well, but the sceintific parts are grossly unobjective and 90% unbelieveable. (Just in case, I am glad that I live in Florida!) I suggest a visit to the library for those interested in reading this book."
3,When Hell Freezes Over,"Another Strieber style book to make you feel helpless. In the 80's we were being examined by ""blue doctors"" and there was nothing we could do about it. And now the masses of drivers in SUV's/Caravans with a child for every seat are sending us us to the next ice age. And the only place to go and survive this catastrophe is Texas. A true living hell on earth..."
3,Good In Places,"The book was good, but some of the parts are really slow to read through, and somtimes its just plane boring. But be that as it may this is a very interesting book about The storms now and the whole theory of the superstorm. If you are the least bit interested in this book read it."
4,For the Critic's,"For the the critics who feel that this book was nothing but BS,one might whistle a different tune and be less critical after reading what the EPA has to say about the implications of global warming. The EPA site should satisfy the ""thirst"" for scientific data that is alledgedly missing from the Bell-Strieber book.Have Fun!"
5,A Frightening Possibility,"The Book ""The Coming Global Superstorm"" By Art Bell and Whitley Strieber is well thought out, well researched and well written. The book is also easy to understand; and it is also difficult to remain unimpacted by the book's message and what it may mean for mankind if it is true. It is a dire warning that we must not ignore."
2,Junk Science at its Best,"The Coming Global Superstorm is science fiction pap. Light on fact and heavy on speculation extrapolated from junk science mixed with just enough facts to add some credibility to the book.Bell & Strieber have collected mountains of urban legends, folk tales and junk science, mixed it together and created yet another great book for the doomsday crowd.If you are a fan of Art Bell buy it to complete your collection but if you are looking for a well researched and documented book on the changes in the weather and the earth in general this is not it."
1,Stick with Aliens Whit,"I have read the book and it is in line with all of the other environmentalist extremist stuff already available, and it adds nothing to it either. There is no real science in it and it better placed in the realm of speculation.It didn;t scare me either. It is a tedious as well. I have read and enjoyed all of Striebers books except for this one. I would like to attribute this failure to his affiliation with Art Bell, whom he doesn't need either."
1,Pardon me while I smirk!,Hucksterism of the first order! Mr. B and Mr. S have to be chortling up there sleeves. Every bad weather event can be used to prove their point. Guess what? Bad weather happens and it's not all from global overheating. I'm not saying we should be complacent or let down our research but this book will do nothing to prove any facts about our future. Makes for good radio theater and snake oil sales but Mr. B knows this already.
1,Save your money and buy a book on a scientific topic,"Bell once again rehashes kindergarten-level scientific mumbo-jumbo to exploit current topics of interest, in order to capitalize on his fame, and make a few extra bucks. Save your money and buy a book with some science content."
1,Global Supersnore,"If you're like a lot of readers, and you've been watching the news headlines about north pole ice melting, and increasingly harsh weather conditions, then you're looking for a book on global warming and it's possible effects. You're looking for a book that will tell you what scientists are saying; what tests they're doing; what indications they're looking at. You're looking for a book that will educate you a little without putting you to sleep. Well, THIS AIN'T THE BOOK! The author is a radio talk-show host, not a science writer, and the book is about as educational as. . .a radio talk-show! There is no attempt to explain; only to scare the reader. The level of real information is about as thin as the ice at the north pole! I was going to give the book to my aging stepfather, who listens to talk radio; but on second thought, I think I'll put it in my next garage sale- he'd never fall for this book."
4,Informative and Scarry,"I have been a fan of Whitley Strieber and Art Bell for quite some time and I always intended to buy ""THE COMING GLOBAL SUPER STORM"" but, somehow, put it off, then, eventually, forgot about it. The recent weather events that roared through the East Coast was called, by the media, a Super Storm and that reminded me of this book. It is a fascinating read. The book is written in two narratives and is extremely compelling whether or not you are a believer in Climatic Change or not. These guys know of what they speak and it would do us all well to heed their message. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good documentary type tale of fiction based on scientific fact."
1,Paranoia cubed,"Here we go again: Art being a prophet of doom and gloom. This is no science, excellent thriller though."
1,Science Fiction at its finest,"If you like science fiction, you will appreciate this zany, imaginative, well-written book. If you're looking for solid information and logical reasoning--don't waste your time. This book is for all the people who were disappointed when the world didn't end with the Millenium. Now they have new disasters to look forward to!"
1,You can also buy a bridge from these guys,"Just remember this book is brought to you by the same people that said the world as we know it would end 1/1/2000 when the computers melt down. Y2K came and went and we are all functioning normally, therefore, I can't see how anyone can take anything this collaboration has to say seriously. Maybe if you are into remote viewing, whatever that is."
2,"Passable fiction, but not good science","This book takes yelling, ""Fire!"" in a crowd to a new level. Using a combination of vague references to unknown writers, clearly slanted style, and half-science, this book is clearly commercial in intent and seeks to capitalize on the ""Sky is falling"" mentality that was so evident before Y2K. The authors are more interested in making money than real science, so save your money unless you just want a provacative story about what if the weather really did go crazy."
2,Fiction or Non-fiction?,"Though this book is fascinating, some of the content poses questions. For example, on Page 24, the authors refer to a terrible ice superstorm in Australia with temperatures of 12 degrees celsius. We double-checked and confirmed this is about 64 degrees farenheit. Pretty warm for an ice storm! Without being too picky, the balance of the book is balanced between describing catastrophic storm scenarios and cautionary warnings based on historical events taken out of context."
4,My 100-word book review,"We normally think of rapid climate change occurring over decades, but could it happen in a matter of hours? The premise behind this book is that global warming could shut off the Gulf Stream and plunge the whole world into a new ice age. Although I find the evidence presented by Bell and Strieber not particularly compelling, climate science has many grey areas and I do not think such an event can ever be ruled out. If you are following the global warming debate and are also, like me, interested in ancient mysteries, you will find this an entertaining read."
4,This may not be a scientific writing...,"In fact, as the authors point out, there are not enough scientific evidence available from the last several millions of years to support or unsupport the hypotheses of the magnitude as presented in the book. However this is not the reason to dismiss this title as a mere fiction. The point is it makes us aware that the global warming is not simply about average surface temperatures going up, but about the radical changes of global weather patterns and what may probably happen as the trend keeps going and how soon."
4,Fascinating!!!!,"This is an excellent work of researched fiction. Art Bell and Whitley Strieber carefully offer historical data, which seemingly is about to be repeated on Earth, possibly resulting in the destruction of society as we know it. The evidence of an ""extinction event,"" which took place millions of years ago, instantly stopping most life forms on the planet in their tracks, is presented throughout the book with an ongoing analysis as to what exactly occurred. Whatever it was, drastic weather changes were somehow involved. Today, global warming and the recent climatic changes around the world make the authors' story and line of reasoning very compelling. Accounts of fictitious worldwide scenarios are interspersed throughout the book's researched data, vividly depicting an ominous scene of what might be to come. The combination of fact and fiction work very well to focus on one concept throughout the book: the possibility of a global superstorm."
2,Snood Like Game With Multi-player Action,"This game looks like a multi-player version of snood made by a Japanese developer. If you are looking for multi-player action then look for something else.Pros: I guess the music would be the only thing that would be a pro would be the music, but even that didn't catch my attention.Cons: This game doesn't really have any depth. The Japanese visual effects are not very pleasing and give it a very cheesy look. The multi-player leaves nothing to be excited about since it has only one mode.Result: If you want a multi-player party game, you are still going to have to get games like WarioWare and Mario Party 8."
4,Love this game!,"My mom and I love this game. Though the graphics may not be the best, but the game is addicting. You can select different levels and there are variations of the game that you can choose. It is lots of fun for all ages."
4,Good fun but different from previous PS2 version,"Alright so I spotted this game at Target and immediately added it to my Christmas List. I was excited to be able to play Bust-A-Move again since our Playstation 2 recently stopped being able to read discs (its dead). So I put it in and of course ended up playing for a solid 2 hours straight. It was easy to play with the Wiimote, a nice change from the previous version that didn't use motion sensors. My only problem with the game was that they left out what I would call 'story mode'. There's not really any bosses to battle or a certain story to follow. You just start at one level and keep going til you lose, then it'll send you back to the select level screen. Kind of weird but nonetheless this game does allow me to play the same basic game. No big complaints, I just wish they would've added a little more like in previous Bust-A-Move releases."
1,Nothing like the arcade version,"This game is nothing like the arcade version. You can win with no strategy and just about by aiming at anything you want. It goes on forever, it's boring!!!"
5,Highly recommended and invaluable for concerned parents,"In Ready For Reading: A Handbook For Parents Of Preschoolers, Ashley Bishop, Ruth Helen Yopp, and Hallie Kay Yopp collaborate to provide clear, concise information about how preschool children learn to read and how parents can substantially contribute to their child's ability to read with competence and enjoyment. Ready For Reading is enhanced with sixty engaging and ""kid-tested"" book-sharing activities, recommendations for more than 400 books and 400 poems for early readers; as well as convenient end-of-book indexes to help parents quickly and easily locate the sharing activity best suited to their child's situation and interests. Ready For Reading is highly recommended and invaluable for concerned parents wanting to insure their child's academic readiness for school through preschool reading readiness and learning activities, skills, and abilities."
3,good overall information,This book has useful information for first time parents/non-educators. I would recommend it to people unsure of how to prepare their children for a lifetime of reading.
2,Not one of the original Wado Karate organizations,"It appears the author was given the 5th dan and then broke out of his organization (Wado Kai?)to form his own subsystem. Therefore this is probably not Wado Ryu Karate as you have seen it before (it wasn't to me). With due respect to expressions of individualism, please mark the book so readers will know. All in all it smells of premature Su-ha-ri.The quality of the photos and text is not bad, but the book feels static."
4,very good intro book for people who know nothing about wado,the book was very esay to follow except that the most used or recpgnized froms were split between the front and the back of the book. Otsuka's forms should have been shown first in their entirerty
4,Good intro to Wado style,"I have been involved in martial arts since 1971.I have a copy of the author's 1988 UK edition of ""Essentials ..."" (which has the same ISBN:0901764965). I was a novice to Wado Ryu/Kai and I found this book to be a useful reference. It was easy to follow, good photography, etc.The author had achieved 5th Dan when he wrote the UK edition and I understand his background to be impeccable (noting that the Wado style is very strong in UK).While visiting the US a few years ago, I bought another book written by the same author - ""Kata and Kumite for Karate"". Again I found this book a useful reference and written to a high standard."
2,Dishonest and Inadequate,"Dishonest- Thompson states the pinan katas he's using are close to the original ones practised by Master Itosu. Anyone who knows a little bit about what the Okinawan pinans look like, will tell you this is false. Thompson still uses the Wado versions of pinan shodan, yondan and godan but his versions of pinan nidan and sandan resemble shotokan moves.Inadequate- For example, how he describes the cat stance. In the book he states the weight distribution should be 60% back leg but the picture shows Thompson doing a different type of cat stance. In Wado, there's side-viewing cat stance and normal cat stance, but the reader would never know that because the book doesn't state the difference."
5,Fantastic Price!!!!!,"I got this text book as promised: in New condition, in 5-10 business days, and the price was the best I could find anywhere online for the same book (actually saved almost $200 from Bookstore price of hardcover)."
1,Horrible,This is the most horrible book for teaching math I have ever seen! It is totally without any merit as a reference for the children to follow when trying to work at home and relies heavily on teachers knowing the subject and being able to teach it to ALL students. There are NO building blocks much less any explainations as to what the kids are supposed to be learning in it or how to even perform any of the requested tasks. I do not recommend this book for ANY school.
4,Freddie King Live Boogie,This Cd has one of the best Sweet Home Chicago covers and then an incredible Got my Mojo Working! I listen to this particular version when I need to get some energy. Volume on the stereo needs to be at least 7 or 8. I believe these are songs from some live European shows in the mid 70's. For the Freddie King fan its definitely worth having! Enjoy!!!!!!
1,Not for discretion!,"This box showed up in a Hugely oversized white box with red lettering saying ""My Home Testing!"" I expected some delivery discretion and certainly did not receive it from this company. I'm really shocked and upset that they think this is ok... Now all my neighbors probably think I'm a whore who has HIV. Terrific."
1,these people keep a list of names,"This is the second time that I have had the misfortune to use a test from this company. Each time they find a reason not to be able to perform the test, and they try to get my name and address to send me a new kit. I think they keep name records to report to the Feds. So much for anonymity! I will never use this company again!"
2,get tested earlier possible,"In many cases STD infections are only discovered when they have progressed to a state which have caused permanent damage to the body and treatment is too late. If you don't want to be late, it is wise to test earlier. Visit [...] or click on HIV Home Tests for more info!i go to here to get tested for other kind of STDsthey have chlamydia, gonorrhea, Hepatitis B Hepatitis C, Syphilis testing device in affordable pricing.all and all, highly recommended to everyone !"
2,Pretty boring for being Mingus,"For being a Mingus album I'd say it's pretty boring. It's not a bad album, but it lacks the edge, the attitude, the wildness of records like ""Ah Um"", ""Blues & Roots"" and ""Mingus, Mingus, Mingus, Mingus"". You can clearly hear that this is Mingus' compositions and arrangements, there are some decent solos too, but it just doesn't have the... the... soul, go and joyful wild attitude that, to me, is what Charles Mingus is about. It feels a bit like ""Mingus goes easy listening"" or something... Way to clean and sort of laid back for my liking!I'm not a jazz expert in any way, but Mingus is the one who brought me in to it, and this is not the Mingus I learned to know. That doesn't have to mean that this is a poor album, but I just can't recommend it, at least not if you're after something representative. For those of you who already owns the majority of his albums; Well, you might give it a try..."
5,The High Wall,"The movie starts with ex WW2 hero Steven Kenet(Robert Taylor)driving with the body of his dead wife,Helen(Dorothy Patrick)next to him.Steve believes he murdered her but is trying to protect his young son,Bobby(Robert Hyatt).Everyone believes Steve is guilty.Soon Steve is arrested and put into a mental institution.DR Ann Lorrison(Audrey Totter)working on Steves case doesnt believe hes guilty and is slowly falling in love with him.Williard I Whitcombe(Herbert Marshall)who was having an affair with Helen,wants Steve kept in the mental hospital at all costs.Good Hitchcock type thriller.Film Noir at its very BEST."
2,"CURTIS BERNHARDT, OPUS 30",**1/2 The title of the film refers to the walls of the county asylum and to the hero's amnesia. Medical students may find attractive this ode to the benefits of Pentothal but certainly not amateurs of film noir. However I liked Herbert Marshall and his lassitude. Already forgotten.
5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book!,"From the start, I couldn't put this book down. The book is of course largely about growing up multi-racial in America, but it also encompasses themes that are universal to all of us. What kept me turning the pages is that this story touches on how all of us learn to love and live and accept ourselves both collectively and individually in settings that are difficult to say the least. It seems like the story could've taken place in any urban American city during the turbulence of the '60s and '70s. Having been a child born in Oakland in the '70s I could fully relate to the circumstances and the times that all of the characters struggled through. I also liked how the author takes us through how the characters came to make the choices they do in order to live in the aftermath of the chaos. The protagonist is endearing, funny, flawed, and fun and it all makes her journey and our read delightful and insightful."
3,Beautiful language; yet seems unfinished...,"I thought this book was well written. The language was simple yet exquisite and at times, so telling, so real. It just seems that there are gaping holes in the story--like Cole. What was her story? And the mother's story seemed unfinished, just like the father's. I agree with the reviewer who said that the other characters were two-dimensional. The ending disappointed me as well. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the book. I didn't expect it to be perfect. I just think more could have been done with it. P.S. I can't believe someone called this book trash!"
5,Beautifully Written!!! I would highly recommend,"Ms. Senna's book was nothing less than exceptional. I am an avid reader and this was one of the best books I have read to date. The subject matter was handled beautifully and realistically. If this is her first book, I can't wait to see what we're in for next.I am recommending this for my book club."
5,"If you have a sister, read this book.","I am an Indian (Asian) woman, I've never lived in Boston, my parents are decidedly apolitical, I have a sublimely stable life, and yet I could relate to so many aspects of this novel about a young bi-racial woman growing up in the tumultuous racial wars of the 70s. Senna's gift is describing the intense love between sisters that can exist in any family, any place.I, too, couldn't put this book down. (I even brought it to work with me and snuck peeks at it when the boss wasn't looking!)This is one of the best books I've read!"
2,Yawn....,"I read this book in a book group and usually can at least appreciate anything that is thrown my way. However, this book was one of the most boring books I've ever read. No one else in my book club even bothered to finish it. While I appreciate and was interested in the topic, the author's voice was completely unoriginial and put me right to sleep. One positive comment: I did grow attached to the little girl who narrates the story."
4,Exceptional. This is her first novel? What's next?!,"I couldn't put it down. It was so real...all the things you notice about your parents, their inadequacies, and in this case, their prejudices...the distancing as siblings grow up, how racial issues so completely permeate the lives of young children so quickly, despite the best efforts of some. And then, toward the end, a choice. How did Cole and Birdie choose to define themselves? For Birdie, her definition was her family, and that ultimately made for a good ending. I cried like a baby when she found her sister."
3,A search for Love and Acceptance,"Our bookclub meets monthly at the MlKing Library in Sacramento--second Saturday. We read African American writers. WE all liked Caucasia. Some conclusion samplings: The nature of oneself if more often dictated by the manner in which America define,dictates, and responds to a race. **We live in a world that destroys families by racism and other isms. Yet families and individuals keep surviving with new truths being discovered. **People like to be able to easily categorize people so they can ""know"" how to address them..what can be shared, what can't. **The book affected me by making me more aware of how insidious the habit of letting people's appearances shape my perception of them."
3,Great literary work,"The book is a good insight to children who come from bi-racial marriages. The author pointed out the political difficulties of raising a bi-racial child in a racist society. I recommend this book for anyone who is involved in an interracial marriage, particulalry black and white. Because blacks and whites are polarized opposites in our society, love is not enough. One must understand and be prepared to deal with the political burden that comes along with interracial involvement."
4,A clear and true voice,"As a newly adoptive mother of a bi-racial child (African American and White) who too could ""pass for white"" (fair skin and blond hair), I found that this book helped me to see and feel the issues that my daughter may face in a way that cannot be conveyed in parenting or self-help books. As a bi-racial woman myself (Asian American and African American), I know so clearly how the internal cultural tug-of-war can feel - Danzy Senna captures it well. If that weren't enough, the time period was captured with sweet and exquisite detail...from the Afro picks to memorizing episodes of ""Good Times"" to Sergio Valente(!) jeans."
4,RACISM INSIDE THE FAMILY,"I enjoyed this book very much but I couldn't get over the fact that Birdie and Cole were seperated, by their parents, by color. Cole going with her dark skinned father and Birdie Lee staying with her white mother. Both Parents Loved their children and were fighting for equality why did they themselves draw those Color lines with their children?"
3,A Search of acceptance and love,"MLKing bookclub, Sacramento, Ca meets second Saturday of month: African Writers We enjoyed the book: Comment Samples: **My own experiences of people making assumptions about my ethnic heritage affected me in some of the same conflicted ways it did Birdie. **The categorization of people into black and white perpetuates the problems faced by black people in the US. **The undying need for family and belonging--the need to feel acceptance within a group.Birdie needed to feel that her own identify fits her no matter how others categorize her. **Canaries in the mine, Birdie and her sisters were experiments in racemixing--however most of all they were human beings trying to find their way and themselves. Their search led them back to themselves and to each other-for love and acceptance."
4,Concerned about Race? Read This Book!,"I read this book over a year ago and I still think about it almost daily! It is a beautiful, well written, heart and brain tickling story about a young girl coming of age in New England having to juggle her mixed race and her unbalanced, flighty mother. I won't give away any golden plot nuggets but the protagonist's, Birdie, ultimate goal is to find her cherished older sister Cole. You feel what Birdie feels growing up, you see what she sees, and you cheer her along through the whole journey. This is truly an excellent book and everyone should read it. I regretted the day I finished it an I am eagerly anticipating Danzy Senna's next book. P.S. Her author picture is breathtaking! My god she's beautiful! And talented!"
3,It's Okay,"The introductory part of the plot is intriguing and I enjoyed learning about the main character and her unique background. However....it seems that about 2/3rds of the way through the plot seems to unravel. At that point I was completely lost and had no idea where the story was going. I became bored and no longer felt interested in her story. I was initially hooked on because I was wanted to read about the experience of being mixed-race, but the story turns into a 5th grade reading level, coming-of-age story about a girl whose parents are separated.Kind of disappointing."
2,This is not the disco cd I thought it would be!,It is pretty standard Christmas fare with a disco beat backing it up. Nice background music for the beginning of a holiday party but that's it! Not rockin' disco like I thought it would be.
2,Super thin and overpriced,Got this in the mail today. Cute picture but totally overpriced. They are way too flimsy and feel cheap. Almost like a disposable placemat. I would not recommend this product.
2,Won't look good for long,"I love the educational value of this place mat. We had fun with it at first. But, every time I wipe (not scrape) some stuck-on food off of the place mat, It wipes the color off. It looks terrible and cheap now. Wish I hadn't wasted my money!"
1,Garbage!!,"The placemats say ""avoid abrasives"", and they aren't kidding! Simply putting plates on them will scratch the design and chip the surface. After two weeks of light use & wiping off with a sponge, they're ready to be thrown away."
1,Image wipes away.,"The first time you wash this placemat or try to wipe it down, the image of the dancers gets wiped away too. My daughter loves this, but I just wish it were laminated."
3,"Cute, but not exactly durable","I bought 2 each for my kids, and they really enjoyed looking at them at mealtimes. They protect the table as they're supposed to, but the graphics/colors fade and look kinda ratty after many months of daily use and wipe downs."
5,Awesome placemats!,"Got 3 of these, loved each one! great colors, education and makes eating fun...great gifts too1"
5,vibrant colors,"This placemat should get 4 stars just for how pretty and vivid the design is. We really love it and my daughter likes me to tell her about each ""dance scene,"" explaining what the dance is and what country it originated in. The mats are also really easy to clean. I definitely recommend them!"
4,"A neat way to teach your child about the solar system, but it has flaws.","I like the colors on this placemat, but after consulting with two astrophysicists and an astronomer, they pointed out to me several issues with the placemat that required me to downgrade its educational value for my son. First, it's not to scale, which kind of surprised me. Second, although I saw the documentary ""Airplane II"", apparently there was no incident in which the shuttle flew towards the sun, as is depicted on this placemat. Third, the correct pronunciation of Uranus is ""Pluto"". It would be helpful if they had a phonetic key on the placemat to teach the proper pronunciations."
4,"Works fine, not too thick, a little non-intuitive, no year","It is thinner than a lot of more modern watches (I measure it as 9.5mm). Compared to the older Casio I replaced, it has one fewer button which makes it a bit non-intuitive (the light button is used for setting things). It also is missing the year, so I assume I must manually adjust for leap-years (not to mention the DST)."
2,"The features I liked were the fragrance, appearance, ...","The features I liked were the fragrance, appearance, and texture. The features I didn't like were the directions, ingredient info (they weren't listed, and I'm allergic to a lot of things), and its lack of ability to remove makeup."
3,I didn't care much for the Ahava Facial ...,"I didn't care much for the Ahava Facial Cleansing Milk. The scent was a little overwhelming. Instead of making my face feel fresh and moisturized, it left my skin feeling greasy. My skin is sensitive and this product made me break out. This isn't a product that I would buy for myself."
4,This was an excellent cleanser. It removed all ...,"This was an excellent cleanser. It removed all traces of my makeup without drying my skin. It was also very lightweight and didn't leave an oily residue on my skin afterward. I loved the fact that it was gentle, yet effective. The lack of scent also appealed to me -- I hate those cleansers that are abrasive and highly scented, which often irritate my skin. This left my skin feeling fresh and soft!! I would definitely recommend this product and will even purchase it!"
3,I can't say that I had strong feelings ...,"I can't say that I had strong feelings about this product one way or the other. One the one hand, the Ahava Cleansing Milk was nice because it didn't dry my skin and it was gentle. One the other hand, and perhaps because it was so gentle and fragrance free, I couldn't really notice the effect. My skin didn't feel noticeably cleaner or better. I felt like it wouldn't have mattered to my face whether I used the cleansing milk or not."
3,Anti-fungal treatment,Just recently purchased this item a few weeks ago-so to be fair not sure yet whether or not it will work.But I must say it looks promising.I have tried many other remedies in the past with no success.But I'm determined this time to get rid of the fungus once and for all.
2,Aviod this release,"What can I say, BORING> DM is my favorite band, but this remix CD is way below par. The original song is way better than the poor remixing on this CD."
1,The mixes on this are disappointing,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. While the song itself is a strong one, none of the remixes do it any justice. Gone from almost every mix is the guitar riff which makes the original song so good!While generally I praise DM for the quality of their remixes, only hard core collectors should consider this release, and even then, most will feel ripped off.If you're looking for good modern DM remixes, pick up the singles for ""A pain that I'm used to"" or ""Precious."" Both have a lot more to offer than any of these mixes of ""Suffer well."""
5,A Moving and Beautiful Book,Ignore the one-star types. This is a moving and oftentimes painful book. Just be open to what you read and do not come equipt with preconceptions about how to write. Price writes an often elegant prose with subtlety and depth. Too bad for those unable to appreciate this work.
2,Long Title Confuses,"I know I should read the fine print, but Elmer's needs to change their picture to show clearly the order is going to be only one color. Yeah, I got what I paid for and we will use it. But why put a picture of all three colors?"
2,Watch the picture,"Watch the picture. The picture shows the different colored boards, so I thought I was getting the multi-colored boards. No, they were all black. Good boards, but I would like it better as multi-colored boards, not all one color."
5,great dance party music as well as listening for non-dancers,I host African students and friends for dance parties and everyone loves this one! It has a good variety of rhythms and tempos as well as some of the best African and Haitian musicians. I highly recommend it!!
4,This game rocks,"This game rocks. Don't lissen to those other retardes complaining. The new create a team rocks. you can make a team with all your favorite players. Now you can also decide if you want to start a fight. It's cool, so u can be in a break away and don't have to get in a fight. The new deke manual control rocks!!!!!!!! You can fool the defender or goaly easily."
4,"NHL 2004 - ""ITS ABOUT TIME! - EA SPORTS""","Well I must say it's about time! EA sports has always lagged behind with NHL for some reason or another. But this time they finally got it right on the money. NHL 2004 is unbelievable, take my word for it. The rinks are bigger and much more defined. You can see the skate marks on the ice, and snow spraying when a player stops short, as well as the lighting from the arena ceilings. The fans in the stands look like real people, and the sound is remarkable. When you slap the puck, it actually sounds like a real hockey game. When it hits the glass, you hear a clank on the glass rather than a thump. The players look 100% genuine in realism, and the gameplay is about as close to virtual reality as you're going to get. Many more features were also added. Have fun with this one hockey fans. You'll love it! ..."
2,ESPN NHL HOCKEY and NHL HITS PRO better,"This game is not that good. The EA sports series for hockey are getting to complex and boring,like this one. You don't have nearly as much control as the other Hockey games, and the slapshots stink!Get ESPN NHL HOCKEY or NHL HITS PRO."
2,this game sucks my balls,"played a game..player control is hard and unrealistic. passing is slow, getting a crisp, quick pass off is not possible. you have to charge up your pass to get a hard one off, and by the time you've charged it up someone take the puck from you. that is not realistic at all.i can never get my player to move like i want it to. they kind of just float around going in the general direction that i point the control.franchise mode on allows for one person to run a franchise, so dotn plan on playing this thing with your friends.in closing, this game suck. espn is a little better, but not a whole lot. ea sports needs to hire me, i can help them fix this game up real fast."
1,Great if you like 20 goals a game,Amazingly this game is more arcadey than Hitz Pro. Get ESPN hockey if you want a real hockey sim and Hitz if you want a fun game. Pass on this one!
4,2003,NHL 2003 by EA Sports was a very disapointing game it was slow and lacking somthing Im hoping that EA made vast improvments on this years game
3,it's ok,"this game is a lot of fun if you are playing with someone else, but it can get a little trying with the computer. for instance, if i were to play 10 minute periods the computer would have on average 18 shots per period. furthermore, the computer's defense is too agressive, i get checked practically every time i touch the puck. the fighting is fun for the first two times. i noticed that when i simulated a season the scores were like 8-6 and 9-5, baseball doesn't even have such offense."
2,Give me NHL '95 or '97 on Sega Genesis over this...,"I rented this because I accidentally thought it was the NHL2K3 series which has turned into the ESPN hockey series. I started to play and notice the extreme lack of control in the game. The basic ICE camera mode stops about 20 feet away from the goalie so scoring is kinda rough in the beginning. Comparing this to last year's NHL2K3 is pathetic...2K3 is smooth and total control when this one seems more graphics oriented but no playability. I live and die with the playability and this lack makes me want to play NHL 95 or 97 two of the best Hockey Games ever because of ... you guessed it , the playability."
3,worse than i expected,I was hyped up about this game when it was first announced but when i got it it wasn't what i expected. PLaying the easy setting it okay but if you switch to medium or difficult the whole opposing team skates toward the player who has the puck. Although i have won the Stanley Cup in my first year I would not recommand this game to any one because it is way to hard to control the players.
3,Need More Control,"I agree with some of the reviewers. Control of the player you have designated is hard, particularly on defense. I think I'm going to check a player, and I end up skating away from him or missing him completely. It's extremely frustrating. I had far more control on the PC version. I bought the PS2 version to experience the play, not to watch, which is what I find myself doing here because I can't control the players the way I need to. Needs work."
1,NHL 2004 controls are crap!,"I have purchased NHL 2004 for the ps2, the graphics are great the special features great. But gaming controls suck!!!!in one hour of game play using having to use the analog, I have spranded my thumb. Also the players are too slow, for example if you playing the computer player, they move 50 times faster than you. the best i could do in one hour of play was get 4 shots on net and thats shooting from center ice and the computer in the ps2 has like 80 to 120 shots on me per game!! It was the biggests waste of money I ever spent. Buy ESPN Hockey 2K4."
1,Worst Hockey Game Ever - EA Sports SUCKS,"I recommend Sega's ESPN NHL Hockey over this game. ESPN has better graphics, realism, replay value, and unlockabls.If you doubt me than go to www.ign.com, www.gamespot.com, or any other major website which reviews games and they'll agree with me. NHL 2004 simply lacks behind ESPN NHL Hockey in every aspect."
1,Worse then 2003,"I didnt think itwas possible, but EA followed up on its horrible NHL 2003 with a much un-improved 2004. The controls will drive you insane, EA needs to learn that more controls does not nesscarily make a better game.Second the gameplay has actually found a way to be worse then 2003. Slow and erratic movements, impossible checking make this game just as bad if not worse then 2003. NHL 2004 will soon find its way to the local funcoland."
2,Frustrating as can be.,"Being new to Hockey games, I Warmed up on ""easy"" mode and spanked team after team, with huge leads in goals. I felt that it was time for ""medium"" mode. I played a few of exhibition games on ""medium"" and managed a win in one out of three. The New York Islanders was the only team I could beat. I figured that if most of these games would be nailbiters, I'd be fine with that, so I plunged into Season mode. Here I cannot score a goal if my life depended on it. For a ""medium"" setting, it seems like it's on the hardest setting. Your entire team, when not under your control, plays like they're from the minor leagues: they skate away from loose pucks, they skate away from obvious passes, your goal-tender is a gimp when compared to the computers. Meanwhile the CPU controlled team just beats the crap out of you, and scores easily, even if you're working incredibly hard for puck control and out-shooting them. It's just a bunch of crap."
2,below average,"this game is below averge....some aspects of this game are good (i.e. the fighting mode, soundtrack,online mode) but most are very bad. the graphics arent that good and the gm mode really sucks.If your team isnt a top 5 team in the nhl right now dont count on getting to the playoffs.I platyed for 11 seasons and put out all-star calliber players and didnt make the playoffs once. whats up with that. and the oppnents poke check works every damn time they put it on u, no matter where they are positoned!my advice is to check out ESPN NHL hockey"
1,awful,NHL 2004 is a huge dissapointment.....i get nhl games every year and this one blows....nhl 2003 is so much better. In 2004 they make the gameplay more &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; which kills the game. The passing is impossible to get it to the person u want to. I think the gameplay itself is terrible. NHL 2003 is so much better to play. ya i admit NHL 2004 is better for dynasty modes and stuff but the gameplay has gone way down from the year before. The only thing that i can say is better is the fighting. Everything else sucks
5,"A smart and funny take on ""This Old House""","This book is a smart and funny take on ""what I learned while repairing an old house"". You feel smarter about the how and why of house structures after you read this book (especially fascinating is the discussion of paneling -- why walls and doors were originally paneled). At the same time Owen mocks the self-importance one feels working on one's house and the messes one backs into when you get the brilliant idea to start a huge project at 6 PM. While Owen is a guy, working on a house, he shares the joy in a gender-inclusive way and you come away with the feeling that the joy of removing plaster is within reach for all of us."
5,Absolutely hilarious,"I have purchased dozens of copies of this book because each time I buy one, I end up giving it to someone. It is THAT funny. Any one who is part of a Jewish family will recognize characters and traits in this book. It warm-hearted and right on."
4,"Worthwhile, but I wish ""science"" meant more than ""physics""","This book is filled with great advice for someone at any stage of a science graduate program. Although much of it is specific to the last few years of a PhD/postdoc, I read it as an early-stage grad student and found it very useful. I think it really helps me focus on the right stuff because I see where I'm heading and what skills I'll need in the future to have a fighting chance at a decent academic job. My one gripe is that some of it really doesn't apply in my scientific discipline, and I wish that had been made more clear from the get-go. For example, epidemiology doesn't really have ""government labs"" where people can just bypass the assistant professorship. It's nice to recommend, but I don't think it's an option for most scientists. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone considering a PhD in any scientific field."
3,Could have more,"I think this book could be really helpful to first year Master or PhD students, especially those who want a career dedicated to research in academia or also a government lab. I thought the subject matter was good and written in an interesting way, but my big problem was the lack of detail and excess of anecdotes. Mostly, the chapters seem more like half-chapters; introductions to good ideas that aren't elaborated upon. As someone who is at the end of a first post-doc looking for ""what's next"" outside of academia, there was not any revelatory information in this book - just good reminders on how to be savvy about your scientific career and make a good reputation for yourself."
3,Obviously...,"Most of the pages in this brief book are devoted to statements of the obvious that anyone worthy of a Ph.D. should be able to discern on his or her own. There are some useful points on presentations and communication. The author points out the excessive burdens of being an assistant professor and suggests that the candidate establish a reputation in industry or government, then seek a (presumably tenured) academic post. Though I agree that one should avoid being an assistant professor at all costs, I cannot think of a single professor in my discipline (Organic Chemistry) who has obtained a tenured position without moving up through the assistant professor rank."
3,Short and most are common sense if you're not deaf,"Easy, fun read, but Feibelman didn't provide any reasons to his opinions that you wouldn't think obvious or have heard of before. There also are NO statistical data to give weight to Feibelman's wisdom. I don't recommend this book if you are serious about your future academic career, but if you are looking for a very easy read of stuff you probably know already then by all means buy the book."
5,non-cynical pep talk,"I think this book is a great read for people beginning a research career. This book manages to get the reader ""psyched up"" for all those things we know we must do (land a potentially permanent job, get funding, publish papers, etc.) without resorting to cynicism. He motivates you to play the game because you love the sport (remember why you went to graduate school?)."
4,Thinking of a Ph.D ?,"This is a good guide to life in research science, it makes the reader think through their options in a realistic manner. It pokes holes in the idea that all you need to do is be enthusiastic to succeed. Definitely worth your while reading the first few chapters before taking on a PhD in Science, as the supervisor and project you choose will have a large affect on your success!! Even if you have started your research work later chapters will give a good perspective on issues for your future in academia."
2,Demoralizing for Aspiring Faculty,"This book encourages graduate students to explore options beyond academia and appears to be overly biased in the direction of industry. This book strongly cautions against the assistant professor position. The arguement is that the fight for tenure can be circumvented by gaining experience in industry and then coming over as an associate professor. It makes one feel incredibly naive for pursuing a direct route to academy.I don't believe the decision is as clear-cut as it is made out in this book. I have worked in industry and academia and many of the concerns outlined in the book occur in both places. Office politics, fighting your way up the totum pole, and the scramble for funding are facets of both types of jobs. I would take Fiebelman's advice with a grain of salt."
4,Accurate and funny,"According to my own experience, this book provides a casual and down-to-earth (but also extremely accurate!) description of scientific life and the different stages of a scientific career. Maybe it is too physicist-oriented (indeed, solid-state-physicist-oriented), but readers with a different background should also enjoy. (Hope so, I'm also a solid-state scientist!)"
3,"Worth Reading, Not Buying","I found this book to be a great introductory text to prepare you for more reading on books related to scientific mentoring. The matter-of-fact and casual tone used in the book sound more like a mentor speaking to you than a published text.Pros:--Very short (109 pages)--Easy reading (casual tone)--Straight talk. A lot of the book is obvious, but it's nice to hear it from someone in the field of science.Cons:--Very short (109 pages)--Outdated (published in 1993) Needs a new version with updated information. No mention of the internet. Mentions using overhead slides in a talk (really, who does that at a professional meeting in current times?)Unless they update this book, I would hold off on buying it. See if you can get it at your school library. It's worth reading, but not buying."
5,"Relaxing music suitable for office, school. or library","This is a wonderful instrumental album that can be played literally over and over during the day and it will just continue to make you feel relaxed and tranquil. I have played it in three school libraries and receive comments like ""This makes me want to go to sleep"" and from students that it calms them down."
2,May Not Be What You're Looking For,"First, this is one tape about one hour long.Second, this tape spends much time on relaxing music and incorporates a subliminal/hypnosis method. If you're looking for that approach, this tape is for you."
1,won't play in computer,Love this old album but it won't play in my PC like every other CD I own. Works in the stereo but the computer sees no files at all and tells me I have a blank disc. I'll keep it to play in the stereo but I won't buy anything here again.
3,Hickory Walking Stick,"This walking stick, is a strieghtened branch from a tree. It has a metal tip that is covered with a removable rubber covering. This branch was streightened by cutting portions of the branch away and then gluing the remaing segments back to each other. ""The branch was not cut all the way through, but by removing wood that created bends. This weakened the staff but it was still suitable as a balancing aid, but not to bear weight. The finish was applied before the tip was attached, leaving unfinished wood visable where the staff was tappered at the tip. Over-all it's OK but appears unfinished with rough areas where wood was removed and glued. It was cheap in price. but I got what I paid for. I suggest making your own"
1,TOO DIFFICULT TO GET ENOUGH BLOOD,"You practically need a gunshot wound to get the amount of blood they want. The lancets they provide have razor blades in them that don't even work, so I went and bought my own lancet from a drug store. I pricked myself THREE separate time with the lancet to get enough blood to fill the area they need filled. They provide a card with a bout a 1"" diameter circle that needs to be filled with blood. But the blood also has to soak through to fill 100% of the reverse side too. Even after 3 needle pricks from the drug store lancet, I couldn't get enough blood to fully soak through. I just mailed it in anyways, and I'm hoping it's enough blood for them to give me a test result, but I'm expecting it to not work."
1,Not worth the money,"Blood sample is extremely difficult. I followed all the instructions, yet had to cut myself in order to collect a large enough blood sample. Despite this, the sample was untestable and no refunds are offered. I wasted 3 weeks and $45 on this worthless product."
4,"Working in the medical field, it never hurts ...","Working in the medical field, it never hurts to know one's status. Although we do use universal precautions, I've worked with a lot of AIDS patients, as well as patients who were high risk. The home HIV access system was easy to use with clear, simple instructions. Everything for testing was provided, right down to the postage-paid mailer. It was completely confidential. The only thing I didn't like was going through the numerous menus when you call to give them your code number at the start of the test, but it does contain some useful information. I received my test results in less than a week. You get them by calling a toll-free number and entering your private access code number. All in all, it was a very good product, easy to use, and I'd recommend it to anyone who may be high risk for HIV."
5,wow,"john flynn is just the most amazing and talented artist i have heard in recent years. his music is very flexible, everything from ""a manatee sneezed on me"" and ""don't make fun of middle aged people"" to ""dragon"" and ""full circle"" john rox my sox"
1,Ignorant and Boring,"Since this was billed as an historical novel, I expected the author to show some historical knowledge and a feel for the time period. Boy, was I wrong. Sontag apparently read a few Encyclopedia Britannica articles, and maybe a popular biography or two. Certainly nothing more than that. Overall, pretty pathetic stuff. Reads like something a high school girl would write for her senior composition class."
2,"""Good"" literature, but boring","The book is well-written, not a pot-boiler, but it was hard to work up any empathy for any of the main characters. If the author had killed them all in the middle, I couldn't have cared less."
1,Disappointed,"I really had a hard time getting through the bizarre, disjointed prologue, but trudged onward because of the good reviews I have read about this novel. However, I soon discovered that the dialogue has no quotation marks - The Kiss of Death as far as I am concerned."
3,Encouragement for the sick,"This is a good book, and I kept in my hospital bag when my daughter was going through treatments - It was a little hard to read - her fault or my own? I don't know, but there is a wealth of truth in it. The encouragement is more for the sick than the care taker."
2,Too superficial to be useful,"Too superficial - it really wouldn't help even a novice collector. The idea of a brief intro guide is a good one, but the author hasn't pulled it off here."
5,Very good book,"Breaking into Televsion is one of the most useful books I have ever read. I just started an intership working for my local Senator. My friend who wants to get into television gave me this book to read before I started. Wow, this is great imformation! There is advice from just about everone in the television business who stated out as as interns. There is also advice from people who now are incharge of inters. If you are an intern or are planning on interning this is a very useful book."
5,AN INTERNSHIP NECESSITY!!,"Anyone can get an internship... However, it is what you do when you get there that distinguishes you from every other intern fighting for a paid position! The text is a guide written to help interns (and prospectives) get on the right track to career success. Most importantly, the authors fill the pages with tales from hundreds of former interns who--with alot of hard work--reached the top, for example: Brian Graden the Executive V.P. of MTV or Brad Besey the Coordinating Producer of Entertainment Tonight! It only makes sense to get advice from such highly recognizable sources, which Weaver and Siegel have done. Although directed towards the television industry, an intern from any area could find this book to be a valuable resource in advancing his/her career possibilies!"
5,"Better get this one fast, the shelves are almost bare...","Hurry to the local bookstore because they are bound to have the hottest book out right now about interning. It is called ""Breaking into Television, Veteran Advice from the Trenches"" by Weaver. This book is packed with helpful info, humorous examples from other people that have interned and are now in jobs (like MTV, E!, Leeza, Oprah...and the list goes on) and great hindsights from these former interns about things they learned etc. The authors of this book are rip-roaringly funny and their personal stories alone make the $12-15 worthwhile. This book is like the toilet paper in the Bowl of life, don't be stuck without it or you'll be left hanging!"
5,Titch,"Titch overcomes his feelings of being powerless because his older brother and sister always have something (from his point of view) that is better. He discovers that something little can be powerful when given time to grow (his seed) Kids like the fact that they can ""read"" this book themselves. I've seen many first graders chose this book over and over...it gives them a sense of ""I did it"". I can read a real story that has a plot. They can relate to it."
4,"More of the same, but in a good way.","After the sonic storm that was Mega Man X, there had to be more, and in now traditional Capcom form a sequel came to be. So, one would ask, does X2 have what it takes to usurp the mighty X1? Well...not really...but not by its own faults. X1 was just such an amazing, outta-nowhere title that is damned hard to dethrone, and as it stands X2 should just be considered the next, awesome chapter in an equally awesome franchise. X2, for what it's worth, kept the same elements afloat (Heart Tanks, Sub-Tanks, Armor Capsules, Ride Armor), only really coming alive by way of pre-32-bit graphic effects, great level designs, the introduction of the Land Speeder bike, and powerful bosses and weapons, not to mention the introduction of the X-Hunter sub-bosses and the return of the unstoppable Sigma, but in the end X2 only really treaded water. Still, this is a strong title that belongs in the higher echelon of Mega Mandom."
2,Wake me up when it's over,"I LOVED The Inferno, so I approached this book with the enthusiasm of a gourmand at an all-you-can-eat buffet. Sadly, the bread turned out to be stale, the steak overdone and the desserts moldy. Okay. Now that I've run that metaphor into the ground, let's talk about Vita Nuova. I found it to be pretty darn tedious and highly melodramatic. The prose is self-indulgent and dry; the poetry, while slightly better, falls into the same camp. You just want to say to the guy--get a life! At several points during the book, Dante's fellow townspeople mock him because of his constant waterworks and woe-is-me-ing. I sympathized with them, found myself laughing at this whiny, timid little man. Dante, as he portrays himself in this book, is a bore, a sniveling, spoiled child."
4,Proof that there's a fine line between romance and stalking,"Dante's La Vita Nuova is a powerful and moving work on how life inspires art. It's more than an autobiography. It is an interesting study of obsessive love, and its profound consequences emotionally and intellectually. The more I read the book I loved how Dante showed the feelings behind the poems.I can see why the movie Hannibal emphasized this work.The themes of the book are also upsetting too. It made me wonder if restraining orders had existed in Dante's era if he'd have been issued one : )"
5,Great classroom management,"This was an excellent resource for my classroom management plan. I teach 6-12th grade and found it invaluable. It was time consuming, but the work was worth it. I know it says K-9, but I was able to adapt it for my high school classes, also. The structure it gave me and the paper trail was also useful in my portfolio and in interviews with other positions. I recommend if you want an in-depth approach to helping you think out your classroom management techniques, even if you are an experienced teacher. Very thorough."
1,Waste of ink and paper,"This book is a classic example of a bitter former JW, It's quit simple, in sports if you don't follow the rules, what happens? That's right you get disqualified or booted from the team. Likewise when God's high standards, outlined in his word are not adhered too, then that person is removed. Simple. The author, if he chose to not be one of Jehovah's Witnesses any longer, should find something more productive to do with his time, as most former members should do also.(...)"
1,I DID NOT GET MY BOOK!!!!!!!!!,"I never got this book AND I was charged $35? for the shipping! OUTRAGIOUS! I will NEVER go on amazon-rip you off in a big way- ,com again and will tell; all of my horrible experience!"
4,In this reveiw I tell about how nice this book is.,"When I got this book for Christmas, I was so excited. I had seen it at Crowns and I wanted it. It is full of colored pictures of sports, exotics, and classic cars. The cars in this book rang from the very exotic Bugati EB 110 GT to the classic and very ugly Healy Elliot. It has a whole lot of info and stats. It has alot of writing and tons of pictures. If you are thinking about this book, you should say yes and take a look at 100 Greatest Sports Cars, another great title. By, Brian the car lover of Illinois."
4,This particular Motown karaoke is great!!,"Every sing is a hit and recognized ! I love it and even my kittle 2 year old loves it, My hisband loves it. Its the real songs and real artusts singing the songs so this particular one is a good buy! I only gave it a 4 instead of 5 because I wish it had more songs"
4,Awesome gift for my 1 year old nephew!,My little nephew can't get enough of this toy. He loves this thing. My sister has sent multiple videos of him cruising the house....alligators going to town...funny stuff.
5,Best walker by far!,"My son is 1 and still not walking well on his own. As soon as he got this walker for his birthday, he got movin'! Of all his walking toys, this is the first and only one he goes to time and time again. He loves the freedom and the fact that he really doesn't slide around (it grips our hardwoods beautifully and keeps baby stable). He also loves the alligators. I'm not a huge Melissa and Doug fan, but this walker takes the cake!! Buy it if you want a good, stable walker to help your little one learn to walk. Awesome!!!"
5,Great walker,This walker is cute and sturdy. Our 8 month old can walk with it and pull himself up with it. The spinning toys catch his attention. The alligators are cute and don't clack loudly at all. We love that it's all woooden & will last a long time.
4,Wooden Chomp & Clack Alligator Push Toy,The toy was a gift for our 1-year old granddaughter and was enjoyed by her instantly. It is very sturdy and has been a help as she learns to walk on her own. Only drawbacks are that the paint began to chip right away and one wheel came off and had to be glued back on.
1,Paint all over walls and floor,"I do not recommend this! If I could return it, I would. It is very lightweight, so when my son pushes on it, it almost accelerates out of his reach. Then, when he tries to pull back on it, it tips backward and he has fallen several times on his back. Furthermore, the blue paint is terrible. It gets everywhere. I have blue streaks on my walls (where he bumped the walls) and hardwood floors after he used it just a few times. Although my son loves the ""clacking"" sounds it makes and the spinning shapes on the handle, there is a real safety issue when using this and I really don't have the patience to scrub all the blue paint off my floors after every use. I have never before reviewed a product online, but I am so unhappy with this that I felt I needed to let others know."
3,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Walker,"With the alligators moving, this walker sure is fun. However, it is too light for little ones who are just learning to walk. Heavier walkers are safer when toddler is taking off with the walker."
1,"Poor Quality, disappointing","Within two days of receipt the glued seams began separating. The wheels, which were warped from day one, stopped rolling and just slid accross the floor. Consequently the alligators stopped chomping and clacking. Trying to put this thing back together to a point where it functions correctly takes more time than it is worth. Our 22 month old has moved on and enjoys pushing his big plastic baseball bat around the house more than playing with this heavy wooden dust collector."
3,"Cute, well made, but too short","Super cute push walker, but it is too short for my little one to use as a walker. My guy is pretty tall for his age, but since the walker should be able to be used beyond his first year it should be height appropriate or have adjustable settings.Unless you have a shorter toddler I wouldn't purchase this walker."
4,Great toy for babies almost walking!,"I love this toy, it's a little hard to push, and not for pulling up on. Once my son was pulling up and standing on his own, he really enjoyed it."
2,the wheel came off and will not stay on,"I bought this walker for my Son's 1st birthday, and it is really cute. But it only lasted for a dozen or so pushes around the living room before the wheel fell off! I have gorilla glued it two times now and tried to nail it back on and that was very difficult. I think there is better out there and for lot less money."
1,Poorly constructed- Dangerous!,"I was happy with this until the top bar came loose just a few days after we bought it! My 20 month old fell forward and landed with his neck on one of the vertical parts. It was terrible, and all because their glue didn't hold. If you buy this, please screw the top bar in place so this doesn't happen to you. This is not the only Melissa and Doug toy we have had glue issues with. Not recommended."
3,Fun walker BUT...,"We bought this walker for our son because honestly I strongly dislike plastic-crap toys that being said I had high expectations for this toy.I expected it to hold up to an eight month old learning to stand and walk behind it. Well, when this toy transitions from carpet to flooring there is a small lip on the back of the walker where it started to catch and then lift away from the toy. I found this to then start to splinter and flake off (No Bueno with a crawling toddler) onto the floor/carpet. I pulled as much off as I could to keep him from picking at it and trying to eat the wooden flakes."
5,Can't wait to use this with our next child,"So sturdy and neat. This is a great-quality push toy for a beginning walker. The absolute best, in my opinion. I really hate those popcorn push toys. This has great support for babies just starting to get the feel of walking. It's made out of real wood sanded finely, so no splinters, and is so resilient. My son has stood on the alligators, smacked them with a plastic bat, and poured an entire cup of grape juice on it, and it wipes clean and keeps rolling. Now that he's older, he's not using it as much (other than to stuff things in the mouths of the alligators), so this will probably go into storage soon for the next baby. This is definitely a toy you can use for generations. Great buy!"
5,Those alligators are hungry.,"This wooden push toy is one of the best toys we've bought for our toddler. We gave it to her when she had just turned one, and she used it every day for months and months. She is well into her toddlerhood now and still loves playing with it.Not all Melissa and Doug toys are of great quality, even the wooden toys, but this one is. I'd say the quality is excellent, actually. The assembly was easy and we really appreciated that the spots where the alligators hit the wood to make the ""click clack"" sound is lined with felt -- so the noise is not grating. It is actually a nice sound and has never been annoying.Highly recommended."
1,Unable to assemble - poor quality control,"Received this cool-looking toy today after my wife and I had ""stalked"" it for months in our local toy store. Unfortunately, we were unable to assemble it because the embedded nuts in the base of the handle were off-center (by about 1/8"" on one side, a bit better on the other). As a result the bolts would not seat properly in the nut and were difficult to turn (probably cross-threaded them). Anyway, after attempting to get the bolts in for twenty minutes, the hex tool bolt heads finally stripped out... GAME OVER. I'm tempted to throw a couple lag screws in it and call it a day, but I may just send it back on general principle."
5,5 stars for hard surfaces - beware if you have carpet,"This pushcart is great for helping my 1 year old learn to walk. I liked the heavier weight of this wooden toy and think it makes it easier for her to pull up. She also has no problem backing it up to reposition once she hits a wall.My daughter has no trouble pushing this on our tile, cork, and laminate wood floors. It works ok on Berber-style carpet, but definitely requires a bit more strength to push. My 1 year old had trouble pushing it across a large short-pile area rug. We do not have any thick/shaggy wall to wall carpeting in our home, but I imagine that she probably could not push it at all on that kind of flooring."
3,Should be all solid wood for the price!,"My son is 2 now so had outgrown this toy, but the veneer by the wheels has started to chip and peel. This was a cute toy and served its purpose but is not very durable. For what Melissa & Doug charged for this, it should be solid wood!"
3,Cute walker,"I love the concept of this walker. My son seemed to like it a lot. Negatives: If my son used it to pull himself up it would usually fall backwards. The front was not heavy enough to counter his weight. So he ended up being very cautious with it. Also, if you have older kids ( like 3-6) around I would NOT get this toy because if you push this toy fast (which they do) it is one of the most annoying toys ever! The chomping alligators are only endearing at a toddler's pace. Anything faster is incredibly obnoxious."
5,High quality toy,I bought this toy for my 11 month old and he loves it. it has absolutely helped him walk better and its so fun for him. He loves the clacking alligators and the toy is very high quality. I would definitely recommend it and will buy it for anyone that is having a baby. Would last through several children.
4,Love this!,"Just a quick note, although we love this toy and it's one of my son's favorites it is not meant as a learning to walk toy. It's definitely made to be used after they learn to walk. That being said once he was able to use it he loves it and so does any other kid that comes over. I love that it's wooden and the alligators make a cute noise when they click clack. It's a super fun classic toy! Also I was pleased the the seller."
5,This thing rocks,"Our daughter just turned one year. This walker has been her favorite thing for about four months now. She LOVES it. We have a quiet street, and she goes marching up and down the block with a huge grin the whole way. It's really fantastic. When I saw it, I was concerned that it might not be stable enough, that it might tip over backwards and plant her on her face, but it's never once been an issue. It's even stable enough for her to confidently pull herself up to standing. And it's remarkably durable -- we're the third family to use this one and it's still holding up great.Is it perfect? Well, no. It doesn't have a lot of ground clearance, so rolling over uneven sidewalks can be tough. And toddlers (our toddler at least) can't really steer it, so using it inside can be a little tedious for all concerned unless you've got some nice long straightaways.This push toy is one of a handful of really indispensable baby items we've owned. Highly recommended."
4,Croc walker,I purchased this item for my daughter who is now 10months old. At first she was uninterested in it but now she loves it. She push's it up and down out hallway all the time. She is not walking yet but I feel that is toy is helping her to gain the muscles required for independent walking soon enough. The toy itself is very cute and durable. Scarlett rams it into things as she walks along with it. I was surprised by how heavy it is but that is good in the case when she pulls herslef up using thr grab bar that it has. Scarlett is currently 19lbs and it does not tip over when she does this. I would reccomnd this toy. Cute and functional.
1,Chipped wood,"This item looks great, but within 3 months of use by a calm 10 month old 2 pieces of wood chipped off in very dangerous choking-hazard sizes. I do not recommend and am hoping for a refund. We'll see."
2,Disappointed,My Grandson loved this toy. He is 10 months old and was pushing it everywhere. Two of the alligators broke the first weekend that he had it. He still loves it but I was disappointed that it broke so easily.
2,Instant migraine,"We borrowed this alligator push toy from a friend. My daughter (20 mos) loves it, and it seems to be well constructed.I hate it!Every time she goes to push it I cringe. The thing is so loud, it's unbearable. Maybe my apartment is extra echo-y. I don't know."
4,Loves it!,"Length:: 0:41 MinsOctober 6, 2011 - We passed this down to a friend and her daughter LOVES it too. She was walking in no time. I love how stable it is. It keeps them from going too fast and flipping it over. Still love it!May 6, 2010 - My 9 month old daughter LOVES this toy. She is so amazed to be mobile. Right now, she can only manage to push it in a straight line. It seems hard to maneuver for beginning walkers. Luckily, we have an open floor plan so she can go right from the living room through the kitchen into the dining room before she has to stop and turn around. I can see her using this for awhile though... putting dollies on it and pushing them around. She wants to play with it every day and gets upset when she can't.Durability: So far we have had no problems. I read reviews that complained that the handle bar comes unglued. The version I received has a screw holding the handle bar in place. We've had it for a month and no defects have come about."
1,dangerous due to poor quality,"We bought this for my daughter's first birthday and she loved it during the first week she played with it. However, wooden slivers from the plywood side panel began flaking and breaking off almost immediately. Each broken piece is about an inch long and incredibly dangerous. We have taken it away from her and will be returning it as soon as I have time. What a shame. I previously loved Melissa & Doug products."
1,Dangerous! Spent the morning in the ER because of this thing,My son loved this toy when he saw that he could walk with it. It was so cute and he was so cute pushing it. A simple trip and he hit his forehead on the sharp edged spinning fish and left a gash right between his eyes that the Dr said would leave a scar! There was blood everywhere! I see from the reviews that this has happened to others and I can't believe that they haven't fixed it by rounding off the edges since it's a known issue.
5,Worth it,"Bought this for my nephew for his first birthday...It is his favorite toy, my sister travels and takes this with him everywhere, including his daycare. Read the reviews on durability and have not had any problems for three months and my nephew is rough on his stuff. My sister claims this is a keeper.... I would definetly recommend."
3,Nice toy but a little small,"I bought this to leave for my daughter to use as my mom's house and was a little disappointed. The toy is kind of small so it is not meant for taller children. My daugher has to kind of lean over to use it (she is 31"" and 14 mo). The wheels are not so great either, I have a similar toy at my house that has regular wheels as opposed to the wood ones, and it is much better."
3,Wish the front wheels would turn,This is a really cute product and it's quality is awesome but I wish the front wheels would turn so that my son could turn it easier.
4,Awesome aid for the newly toddling,"This cute toy helped keep my daughter steady when she was just learning to walk, and it's pretty hilarious to watch her zip around with it now, six months later. She sometimes uses Chomp and Clack as a battering ram, so my husband added some felt padding to the wood beside the front wheels, which helped the furniture, but not my ankles. One of the alligators stopped chomping a couple months ago due to aforementioned use, but I still highly recommend this product."
4,A super cute push toy,"I bought this for an infant classroom. It is such a cute push toy. The crocs clack when you push the cart. Some of the children were initially a little timid of the clacking and moving of the crocs, but enjoy it now."
3,A 1st Birthday Present,"I thought this toy looked cute on line for my little grandson's 1st birthday present. It is cute and seems heavy duty, however, it is a little short for his size. It doesn't turn easily and he has a hard time backing it up.(He's is not yet walking on his own, but can hold on and walk with it.) I ended up also purchasing another toy (a little plastic shopping cart with removable items in it) which he enjoys much more."
3,And then there were two....,"Well my son loved this thing. He loves pushing it all over the place and letting the alligators go clacky-clack. It seems durable and stable. I don't feel like he is going to fall on his face pushing this before he can otherwise walk. However, IN LESS THEN 24 HOURS one of the three clackey-clack alligators stopped clacking. And the chamber their workings are in is sealed, so there is no way I can try to figure out how to fix it without breaking the toy. So now we only have two alligators clacking : It really is going to be a sorry toy if another alligator stops clacking. The three stars for fun is with two alligators, it would be 5 with all alligators working, and one if one or less alligators end up working."
5,Great Push Toy,All my grandchildren had this toy and I bought it for a Christmas gift for my great niece. It is the perfect toy to help them learn to walk. The rubber around the wheels make it go slower and it is great on carpet or hardwood floors. It holds up well and the kids love it!
4,Pleased = ),I am glad I got this for my daughter. She loves it! It is colorful and durable (so far). I love the chomping alligators. It seems a little hard for her to turn but she's learning. Thanks!
2,Made in China !!!,"I was So dissapointed to find that this, and now I've learned most other toys from Melissa and Doug, is made in chinaIt lost 3 stars just for that.That being said, my son loves it already at 5 months. He likes watching it when we push it or playing with the Gus on the back when he's sitting next to it"
5,Sturdy Walker,My 11 month old daughter loves this toy. She has had it for over a month now and she can't stop moving around the house. She loves the little alligators and the fun chomping noise they make. She took her first steps at 10 months with the help of this walker. This toy is extremely sturdy and I'm very happy with its construction.
4,Alligator Push Toy,We bought this for my granddaughter when she was learning to walk. It is easy to push and kept her happy for while. She liked the spinning toys on the handle as well. It was a little hard for her to turn though.
2,Poor Craftsmanship,"I was so excited to buy this walker for my 11 month old son. When it arrived I was very pleased to see it only had two parts to assemble! But due to poor craftmanship we couldn't even screw the screws into place. My husband had to take it out to the garage and ""fix it"" so we could actually assemble it. After it was assembled we noticed that 1 of the 3 alligators that go up and down wasn't working.However, my son does LOVE this walker. And I do like that it is made out of wood and not plastic."
2,Mini-Walker,"This walker was smaller then other ones we had tried. It was too small for our 1 year old who is learning to walk. This should be called a ""mini"" walker."
2,Kids love it but it is extremely loud!,"It is adorable, classic and kids love it. Unfourtuantely it means when they are using it you hear this very loud clacking, like they are banging wood on wood. As they get older and run faster it is unbearable! We were constantly hiding it. It was in the closet more than it was out."
4,Great push toy to help learn walking,"This toy is great and is helping my daughter learn to walk. It is shorter than I expected but that doesn't seem to bother her at all. Its pretty loud when she goes full speed, but I think that is something that most babies/toddlers like even though the parents might go crazy. It is very sturdy and safe -- very high quality. Overall, a great toy."
3,"Stop Anger, Be Happy","I was ordered to buy this book as part of a disciplinary action. I do not like self books. I have never bought one before, and I hope to never buy one again. I was forced to write this review as a requisite to completing an on-line anger management class. I am not comfortable recommending it to anyone."
4,An Anger Overview,"This book was a great primer in the study of anger. It showed me a new approach to several important concepts like the 'time out' and breathing techniques. The concept of journalizing ones angry moments was startling. Breaking down the anger cycle was helpful to me. Those first few moments are critical, but having tools supplied by the book makes all the difference in salvaging a stressful situation. I probably should re-read it every year. Or maybe every month!"
4,great help,this book helped me figure out what my issues with anger were and what i needed to do to change them and my life.
4,good,the book was very helpful. It taught me about myself and about others. It was also very simple to read with lots of activities. Although there were a few gramatical errors.
5,Excellent laymans guide!!,Excellent layman's guide for help you to control your anger. I used it to take an online anger management course and it helped me IMMENSELY!! Would highly recommend this book for ANYONE who has anger management problems!
4,Learning New Way to Manage your Anger,"This is a great booking for using tools to effectively manage your anger. Oftentimes, when we are angry we act impulsively and lash out unexpectedly. ""Stop Anger, Be Happy"" provide alternatives to this type of situation. I recommend reading this if you are having trouble controlling this emotion."
4,Great Help for Understanding Anger,"I enjoyed the simplicity of this book as well as its direct approach to handling your anger problems, and differentiating between anger and other emotions misconstrued as anger. It was very useful for me in my personal life, and I have shared it and various tid bits of information with friends and family after having read it, and they all agree it has the most direct approach to dealing with and controlling your anger. Thank you Kathy Garber for putting this book into our hands at such a low cost! You have helped change my life and the lives of those around me! Knowledge is contagious :)"
5,Book review,I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in examining and improving their thought process and having a desire for self-improvement.
4,Review of Stop Anger be Happy,I think that this book is a well written self-help piece. It forces the determined reader to come to grips with his/her problem regarding anger. It provide a great road map for assessing the situation and a method or technique to avoid dangers and pit falls. I think that if one follows the author's advice; one can greatly improve or eliminate one's anger problem!
3,Nice Book,"It's a good interactive book for recognizing the problem, and effectively managing it. Kathy is able to introduce a lot of realistic words and practices and encourages interaction."
5,Recognize your behavior and learn how to change it,"This book is an excellent resource in learning how your behavior affects you and the others around you. You are not alone in experiencing anger. It is what you do with your anger that is important. Many techniques to manage your anger are discussed and if you practice them on a daily basis you too can start to see changes in your interpersonal relationships. This book is highly recommended for people who understand that you can't change the world, you can only change yourself."
4,"Stop Anger, Be Happy","I have read this book as a part of a class that I took. I found the information within to be beneficial in helping to control anger and to learn how to change your own behavior so that you will have better outcomes in stressful situations that often make you angry. You can expect to learn ways to better understand where your anger comes from, different ways of dealing with anger, and the means to overcome the negatives in your life regarding anger management."
5,Everyone Should Read This book,"This book gives one excellent steps to managing anger, it lets you know that anger is a healthy emotion, it is only dangerous when not used correctly. I found this book to be a great tool in my life and think everyone could use the information positively."
4,the book for the success,It is a good book to help and manage anger in the society. it will help us to realize how worse was our condition when we were in a situation of fighting and hurting others.
5,"Stop Anger, Be Happy","Stop Anger, Be Happy is the first anger management book I have read that makes sense. It is easy, straight forward and a book that everyone can easily understand. It doesn't talk about eliminating anger, it talks about how to deal with anger. Working through this program is working for me and I feel motivated to keep going. I recently joined the website, AngerManagementOnline.com which uses this book as it's guide. Not only does the book help me with my problems with anger, the website is a definite benefit with the bulletin boards and facilitators explaining the materials. A definite book for anyone wanting to change their life and their behavior."
4,Good directions and self-help,"Ms. Garber does an excellent job of guiding the reader through the process of identifying anger, types of anger, and gives positive directions and steps for making a change in your life. The exercises help the reader really see the picture and make effective changes to his or her behavior."
5,Everyone should read!,I was very impressed by the information covered in this book! I highly recommend the book to everyone. The skills learned and the information given are a necessity when dealing with the various personalities we come across daily.
4,anger management,"This is a practical, easy to learn book on anger management. It helped me with my anger management. I highly recommend it."
4,Anger is a choice.,I found this book to be helpful and informative. If you are required to take an anger management course the associated online program is the way to go because it is so flexible. We are all products of our upbringing and this book focuses on that. In the end you realize that you have the power to stop anger and when you don't that you are giving up that power to others. Take the time to change your own life and take your power back.
4,Stop Anger,Stop anger be happy is a well organized guide on controlling anger. It is very clear and uses examples most anyone can relate to. The book helps to really take things in steps. It has built in time for reflecting on things and is not meant to be read in one sitting. I liked that the book's pace was not too fast as this allows for you to really focus on yourself. Another thing the book does is educate you about why you may be having certain issues. It explains where the issues come from and how they might manifest themselves in your everyday life. Stop Anger goes above and beyond normalizing your problems by explaining that everyone has anger but that we learn to deal with it differently. This is important because people often feel alienated and strange when reading books of this nature.
5,Good Book!,"This is a great book along with online course. If you don't have time for an anger management class, this book and class will help you greatly!"
2,Simplify it,"This book is a lot of words with just space fillers. There is little real words needed. a chapter will be 15 pages when it could be at most 5 but I guess if you want someone to pay [...] bucks for it, it got to look like the size of other books."
2,so-so,so-so book. many errors in grammar. written at fairly low level. material and content okay. does not seem seriously written. would be much better if professionally proofread and edited.
5,anger management,I found this book to be a very very useful tool in my anger management. Its a very simple book to use. read all the chapters are key if any success is to be made at all.the program that goes along with this book is a great way to help control the anger problems of anyone.
3,Learning how different things can cause anger,"This anger management course has helped me a lot. It amazed me to find out how anger can affect my body. For example the stress of anger, and how it can make you sick, or hurt. How the mind can think things that are not true, but because of things that happeneded in my pass will allow me to think that some one is trying to aggravate me, when it may just be me. I also learned that I have the right to control my anger, and not others. I learned how to take time outs to get myself together before responding to a situation. Also, if there are situations that I know are going to cause me to be angry, I should remove myself if at all possible. This time I spent with the anger management has taught me different techniques such as relaxtion through deep breathing, deep muscle relaxation, and relaxing imagery. I realize that I have to be honest with my issues, and not use the word you, but focus on me."
4,good,"i think that this was a bit of help. it was better if you dont like sitting in a room with someone for hours., but if you are not one for reading, this is not for you"
4,"Stop Anger, Be Happy","This was a very good book. I have been able to apply this material in both my work environment as well as my home life. It has helped change my life. My co-workers can't believe the changes that they have seen in me. And at home, My wife is amazed at the differences that she has seen in my attitude. In the past my wife would never come outside to work on a project with me because I was so short tempered. Now she said that she actually enjoys coming out to help me with projects. I recommend that everyone with anger issues read this book."
3,decent,pretty decent book. loses some effectiveness in its attempt to be toooo simple and ez to follow. all in all a decent book if you are willing to work with it.
4,Good Read,This is a good book. It does a good job of defining anger and teaching you ways to recognize your emotions and how to express your anger in ways that are healthy and productive. I found the chapter on setting boundaries especially helpful as well. It is worth the time it takes to read. You won't be disappointed.
4,Gina's review,I think this book was good. It really helped me learn steps to control my anger. I liked how at the start of each new chapter it reviewed key points from the previous chapter. It flowed well and was easy to understand.
3,Great Book! Easy to Use!,"I used this book as part of an online anger management course. The book is nicely divided into chapters that address recognizing and effectively managing anger. Kathy ,the author, has written this comprehensive book to emphasize all of the areas of anger management with practical suggestions and exercises. Works well with a course, but if you can't take a course, I would bet you would still benefit. Easy to read."
4,Simply a good look in the mirror,Not only was some insight provided but a method in how to implement techniques. It made sense. I'd recommend it to anyone.
3,Neutral product,"Sent some packs of this to my mom who has arthritis with finger joints. She took 3 pills each day for more than 1 month already. According to her, there is no significant change in the pain in her joints. However, what she is sure about is this product doesn't make it worse. :D"
5,gentle on your stomach,"My husband and I have been using this product for several years now and are very satisfied. Gentle on your stomach, the added tumeric and ginger help with inflammation."
5,A great book for women too!!,"I found myself deeply touched by Leon Prochnik's gutsy, from-the-heart account of his encounter with prostate cancer. In sharing how this much-feared disease affected not only himself but his wonderful wife, Mia, Leon gives the reader the highs, lows, and everything-in-between that occured on this journey. And a great surprise - Leon's narrative is laced with a wonderful sense of humor -something you almost never find in books about cancer. My husband and I drew strength and inspiration from every chapter. And to discover that there is a way for men not only to keep but enhance their sexuality after prostate cancer, wow! If you're a woman who loves her husband, father, brother, son, read this book! And get them to read it too!"
5,Very Pleased!!,I ordered this combo kit for my husband. Absolutely the best! Our remodeling projects are underway and this combo is definitely helpful along with other recently purchased Dewalt tools! Thank You to Dewalt and Amazon for quality and dependability. Very Pleased!
4,"More Subtitles, Please!!","I'm not sure if it was simply my edition of this DVD, but the subtitles in it were quite sparsely placed. There were whole sections of the movie in which there were no subtitles at all, which only made me feel excluded from what I thought was a truly wonderful movie. So many great actors and such a valuable social commentary--from what I could understand, this movie really moved me. I understood the essentials; I just wish I could have had more subtitles, so that I could have been admitted further into the tragic, but ultimately heroic world of these Indian women."
1,Disappointed,I was excited to find this item as I had one long ago. Unfortunately quality of the product was poor and excitement quickly waned
5,"Quick read, lasting impression","This may be a small book, but its teaching are far from small. What we think is what we speak. If you think death and destruction, you will speak death and destruction. If you think according to God's will and of your faith, you will speak life and prosperity. Life and death are in the tongue!You'll be surpised at how easily we can think the wrong way and not recognize it. VERY enlightening book. One of my favorites of his mini-books.Enjoy!"
3,life's programming,"The book has excellent help and enlightenment for all believer's young as well as old; because sometimes we think we have the right thoughts and discover that we do not. We also must learn that we have to unlearn a lot of the world's way of thinking and behaving, and begin to think on higher things that pertain to the Kingdom of God and doing those things that please Him.This book will help you to become more aware of yourself if you look openly at yourself and at the word of God.I would suggest everyone have this book to help them realize things we certainly take for granted; ourselves and others."
5,Change your thinking!,Great book! Kenneth Hagin is a wonderful teacher of the Word. Renew your mind with the Word of God. Do it daily!
3,Ok But Only Because Of Some Of The Music and BecauseTom Sturridge Starred In It,I am not a big fan of comedy movies so I cannot say this is one of my favorite movies of all time but the only reason I bought it and watched it was because Tom Sturridge was in it and I find him the most beautiful man in the world. I love to see anything that he is in whether I like the plot of the film or not. Also I was grossed out by fug ugly Talulah Riley and that fat dj man who was gross and perverted. Otherwise I thought Philip Seymour Hoffman was the life of the movie and the best actor in it. I think this is more a movie for a sixties fanatic. As I said the only reason I got it is because Tom Sturridge was in it.
5,Essential Rock History,"Pirate Radio is an important a film, for the rock historian and lover of the genera, as Woodstock, Monterey Pop Festival, Gimme Shelter and Let it Be. Another film, Telling Lies in America, is also an essential look into the payola days of early rock and roll. Pirate Radio is a great film; entertaining not only for the music but for the great acting."
4,"Great story, but...","I really enjoyed this movie, but was disappointed to realize that this version had an entire scene cut from it. The scene was about a second visit by women on the week-end, at which time the government lackey also snuck on board and learned that the ship was barely seaworthy. It's a shame the scene wasn't there, as it would have helped things make sense when the ship later got in distress. Why was it cut, I wonder? American storytelling, versus the senses of the original British editors? Just a minor disappointment in what was otherwise a rockin' story."
5,Best Movie I've Seen In Years!,"This is one of those movies that you want to watch over and over again. It's funny, uplifting and different. And....THE MUSIC!!!!!! Fabulous! The cast is brilliant, each one a stand-out, from Phillip Seymour Hoffman's The Count, to Rhys Ifans Gavin Cavendar, there sense of comedic delivery is spot-on. Even the deleted scenes are hysterical! Don't miss this movie!"
5,My favorite movie of the year,"And I don't use that term lightly. Amazing soundtrack, great story line and great actors. British humor at its finest, and completely entertaining. Watch it, enjoy it, leave it on the background but keep it!"
3,Disappointing,"I expected much more. Great music, great cast and a tried and true premise: rock 'n roll versus the forces of prudishness, control and fuddy-duddyness (particularly when the latter is embodied by Kenneth Branagh, looking like Hitler-as-cabinet minister). The film's flaw is a weak script with crude sex jokes, crude situations and the failure to fully utilize the talent at hand. The scenes on the ship grow claustrophobic and the film loses the energy that the cast and premise lead the audience to expect. I still love Hoffman and Nighy. Unfortunately, this was not their best vehicle."
2,Pirate Radio,"Having been a student during the Pirate Radio days and enjoying the DJs when they were young, I was very, very disappointed in this film. The product was good and it arrived in a timely manner. Sadly, watching it once was more than enough for me."
4,Pirate Radio DVD,"I gave the DVD 4 stars because I haven't actually played it yet. However, I did see the film and thought it was exceptionally good with 5 star music. And, as usual, Amazon shipped the product promptly."
1,Uninformed and disappointed,This video refuses to play unless you DVD/tv is connected to Internet. May be a way to get around it but have not figured that out. It was not obvious when purchased nor do instructions come with it.
1,pirate radio,this cd sucks the big one. i watch the movie then bought the cd. i cant remember hearing most of the somg from the movie that they put on the cd.
3,pirate radio,"well it was cute didnt really get to reality of this but we know movies do not include reality ever, just little bit"
2,Four stars ? REALLY ?,"Painful. Couldn't finish it. And I'm a PSH fan. A bunch of disjoint scenes glued together. Characters that are not appealing. Hodgepodge of period music, good songs all but not terribly spectacular and methinks not chronologically accurate."
5,USA version vs UK version,"I am heartbroken! When I originally watched Pirate Radio I didn't realize it was the UK version. It was fantastic, the story, the music everything I couldn't wait till it came out on dvd. Then when it finally came out I couldn't find it anywhere to buy it. Not even Walmart was carrying it in their stores which I thought was strange. Finally I came to Amazon and bought mine. Wow what a butchered piece of crap. I don't know why the 2 dvd's are so different. Yeah the dvd's do contain the deleted scenes, most of which were included in the UK version but it's not the same. If you are going to buy Pirate Radio do yourself a huge favor and find a way to get the UK version. Watch out for the coding for your dvd player as UK dvd's don't play in USA dvd players, but from what I understand you can get the blue ray and get the UK version that way.What a way to butcher a movie that was so great!!!! Someone seriously needs smacked for this one!"
3,better before they cut it to shreds,I saw the movie before they cut so many scenes out and after and I have to say it was a better movie before they deleted so many scenes. The bachelor party...the banter when the DJ's were climbing...so many deleted scenes! I think so many people feel the movie was disjointed because it was ruined after it was changed so much. A shame I think.
1,"Watch the UK cut ""The boat that rocked"" not the US one ""Pirate Radio""","You should actually watch the real cut of this film. The U.S. cut of this ""Pirate Radio"" is not worth anything. They cut out all the meat of the comedy and left you with nothing. Now as for the Europe cut called ""The Boat that Rocked"", now that one was worth the extra cash that I spent to get it from Amazon UK. This cut I compare to the equivalent of watching the basic cable version of ""Mall Rats"". If you have seen that cut, then you know its not funny at all compared to the uncut version."
4,"Great fun,","Love this movie, just a lovely tribute to a time when rock and roll was still subversive. And the Beeb, as an instrument of the government, decided subversive needed to be suppressed. Not for the last time, either, but that's another story."
3,British Comedy,"This movie is loosely based on historical events. I lived in England for a short time and listened to Radio Caroline, a pirate station. I enjoyed the movie for this fact, and the sound track was fun."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I watched this movie with great anticipation AND even greater disappointment. I am old enough to remember the incident and the times.""Pirate Radio"" is nothing but a cheap sex/comedy movie and little else. If that is what you want, then you found it!There was NO discussion of the issues of freedom of speech which were the grounding of the entire matter. Yes, some bureaucrats in the British government were made to look like fools, but there was an ABSENCE of the very important issues involved.Incidentally, the Brits are WAY ahead of us here in the States when it comes to humor and sexuality. If you ever want proof, buy a DVD from the Red Dwarf series!"
1,Would give on star,"Pirate Radio DVD is unplayable. Freezes in the beginning, none of the menu options work. Had to shut off player and restart just to get the DVD out of the machine."
1,yuck!,"Don't waste 2 hours of your life! This is a horrible, silly farce with maybe 3 funny jokes in the entire movie. Pirate radio is a fascinating topic, but this movie is neither informative nor entertaining."
1,One star is a star too many !,Sophomoric BS for the sexually repressed trying to prove themselves.Music is good though ~
5,A Great Rock and Roll Tale!,"Loved this movie! Totally cute, fun, feel good, great music. Too racy for PG-ers :) But hey, that's how it was back then!"
3,Never finish a song,"Little Carl (Tom Sturridge) has led a clustered life (only licked by a cow), and now is mother (Emma Thompson) decided it is time for his real education. In his new environment of perfectly normal associates on a Pirate Radio Little Carl has semi-sexual relationships while listing to 60's/70's rock.This is a filler film with the lure of fantastic music. This turns out to be a run of the mill coming of age movie. I have to admit that Kenneth Branagh looked like he had fun as the antagonist. Emma Thompson is just as cute and a believable actor as ever. I lived through the real era and enjoyed the music snippets.Only saw the Blu-ray so I cannot compare to other presentations. The voiceover commentary usually adds to a film. In this case, it is just a voiceover commentary with no real insight. There are other extras as deleted scenes and BD live. However, they do not really contribute much."
2,I so wanted to like this movie...,"I really wanted to like Pirate Radio. Sex, Drugs and Rock & Roll. Great actors. How can you screw that up????Well, you can take your great set-up, fill it with potentially interesting characters and give them a completely lame ""plot"" to work with. Then make your characters more and more one-dimensional, smug and unlikeable. Oy. This was such a great idea...."
1,The Canadian Inuit Dog,"Was excitied to find a book on this topic (Inuit dogs) but upon receiving the book, was dissapointed in the misguided information and the lack of supporting documentation. The book is mostly the authors opinion and not particulartly well written.The photos were nice though."
1,Inuit Dog,"This book is informative about this breed, especially since it is the only book available on the Inuit dog. Lots of good info on the history of the breed is included. I was very disappointed that the author was overly opinionated about who should own one of these dogs. For a book that should be singing the praises of the breed, she spent too much time discouraging the reader from ever owning one. Nonetheless, if you are interested in this breed, it is the only place to get much information."
3,Highway Robbery,"It's a nice book, but not even remotely worth the $76 these crazy used book sellers are asking for it. Borrow it from your Library."
2,B&W pictures nowhere near as stunning as original,"I love this book; the original, (hardcover) is lovely and moving with beautiful full color pictures. I just thought customers should be aware the paperback version is NOT the original. The paperback version is smaller, thin, with what look like fairly cheap black & white photocopies of the original's gorgeous paintings. There is no way to do the art justice in b & w.It's just a shame, because this is such a unique, perfect gift of welcome to a new little girl & family, and it deserves to be seen in all its glory for the full emotional richness.Let the company know you want the full color, high quality version reprinted, and maybe they'll oblige.Meanwhile it is well worth your time to find the rare (hardcover)copy in good condition of the original version. Good luck!!"
5,"Wonderful voice & a wise, funny, brilliant song writer","A few years ago, I heard an audition tape by Susan Piper (long before her album was released) and fell in love with her voice and song-writing style. I was so happy when this album became available. New on the Planet is a wonderful album. Piper's lovely, lyrical voice graces every song with a rich, warm feeling. Her songs reveal a uniquely wise and funny woman. For me, Susan Piper is a gifted song writer with a beautiful voice."
5,A Collectors Item for Theosophists!,"Celebrating 50 years of the Theosophical Society - all the great teachers are mentioned. The photos, being old reproductions and a bit fuzzy, are still extremely valuable. It's a virtual who's who of TS and well worth having for anyone interested or involved with this amazing organization."
5,Angels Are Among Us.,"I Have This Song On The ""Cheap Sheats"" And ""Greatest Hits Volume 3"" Albums. It Is A Great Ballad To Listen To. In The Video They Had These Children Sing In The Background With Candlelights In Their Hands. This Is A Great Song To Listen To On Christmas Day."
5,Very powerful song,"""Angels Among Us"" in fact is a very uplifting song by Alabama. Matter of fact, the song was done in rememberance of Dale Earnhardt back in Feburary when he died."
5,Great song for sure!,"""Angels among us"" is a very great and powerful song that moves everyone, young and old. I have only heard this song recently, but just a little while after, I bought this c.d and loved it! The song has great lyrics that would touch a persons heart. Although my age is very different than those who listen to this song, personally, I love country music and can't get enough of this song! So over all, I'M LOVING IT!Drew"
5,Angels Among Us (Program Music),Song was used by a law enforcement agency at the close of their Medal of Valor ceremony. Very emotional evening for everyone. Many tears in the eyes of those in the audience.An excellent choice for an awards ceremony recognizing those who have saved lives.MC
3,No footnotes but a entertaining read,"The prose on this book can be a bit dry at times and there is a lot of generalizations throughout the entire book without footnotes to back up some of his ideas as they are stated as if they are concrete facts. However, the book is divided up nicely in about 20 or so pages per chapter and they read like a lecture would sound if you were sitting in on the authors class and that made it enjoyable to read. The book ends pointing out several generalizations about the 17th century history of Russia that are still revelant among historians today."
1,Don't Let Food Get On This Placemat.,"I was disapointed in how flimsy the material was.As it is for children to eat food on, I expected it to be able to be a little durable. Instead the color and drawings came off after a few scrubbings.Do yourself a favor and buy something that is made of plastic - this is like cardboard that has been run threw an ink printer."
2,Pictures wore off,"I purchased this because it was PVC free and it looked cute. After a few washes the pictures started to wear off. My son put a big scratch on it just by scrapping his fork on it - it wasn't done with much force either. My son likes to color on it now instead of using it at meal times. He uses a ""big boy"" place-mat now. I liked a lot of the features on the screen but it just didn't hold up. If I were to get a new place-mat, I would start with a different brand."
2,Crocodile Creek Placemats Don't Last Long,"We received 4 placemats made by Crocodile Creek about two years ago. They're fun placemats, but they don't last. The color fades with normal sponge washing after meals. Now, each placemat has many white areas where the color has completely disappeared. Further, I had to throw one placemat away because it developed a large crack. I'm now looking for new placemats. Overall, I would steer away from Crocodile Creek products unless they substantially improve the quality."
5,Must own golf classic,"Many golf instructional books and teaching pros refer to what Hogan said in this book. It seems at first both overly analitical and shallow. But within it are the gems that will bring your swing into it's full potential. For example, when I first read Hogan's statement that the kness should not only be flexed at address, but turned inwards as well. I'd never heard an instructor tell me that. One day on the range I started doing it. Suddenly my swing became smoother and my hands had time to turn over through impact. One little seemingly minor detail and I immediatly went from shooting in the mid 90's to the mid 80's! I keep going back to this book to review the fundimentals and to mine the gems ""hidden"" in this classic."
5,Ben Hogan's passion,"Ben Hogan's 'Five Lessons' is remarkable on many fronts. Perhaps most surprisingly to me is the utter passion that he manages to evoke on the printed page. This is a man who had absolute dedication to golf as evidenced by his magnificent career. But his thoughtfulness about the game and his detailed analysis of every aspect of the central activity of golf, the swing, is truly remarkable. It is no wonder that everyone familiar with this book regards it as the very best that has ever been written. I agree and suggest that all the subsequent books are very much the follow-up notes."
5,Simple,It's amazing that the simplicity of Hogan's lessons converts to a large improvement in your golf game. Great book.
4,Ben Hogans five lessons,"I found the book to be very helpfull, the price was right and the shipping was ontime.I am a beginner and find it confusing to have so many differant view points on golf.In every direction you turn. Ben hogans teachings are of the basic fundamentals and start off right from the grip to the stance.I believe when you are talented and practise 8 hours a day there is almost no right or wrong in any sport. Just look at (Charles Barkley)This book gets some of the real basic fundamentals for the rest of us on the right track. And when I have a chance I need to buy another because I spilled coffee on mine :)"
4,ESSENTIAL GUIDE IF YOU WANT TO LEARN THE CORRECT WAY TO PLAY,"A PERFECT SUPPLIMENT TO GOLF LESSONS. THIS BOOK HELPED ME LEARN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE SWING.THERE ARE CERTAINLY A FEW AREAS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN IN WRITING, BUT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN THIS BOOK IS GREAT. IT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A GOLFER AND I HAVE SINCE RECOMMENDED TO SEVERAL FRIENDS"
5,Pre Season,"This book is great. I found out about it from the best golfer on my high school team about 6 years ago and it helped me go from a 90s golfer to a 70s golfer in about a year. Now, it is a book that I read every year at about this time to remind me on how to do everything the right way. I always learn something new to help my swing. This is a necessity for almost any golfer. Unless you are Tiger Woods, get this book."
5,Five Lessons,"I found the advice provided has given me a better understanding of the fundamentals of the ""Golf Swing"" process, excellent"
1,Old and Brittle,"Rated as good yet the one I got was old, yellowing and brittle. Not as described and regret purchase."
2,These people sound like golf infomercials.,Ben Hogan basically invented the modern golf swing and we think that this book would couple great with professional golf lessons.
5,Ben Hogan's Five Fundamentals of Golf,"If you're going to play golf, you need this book. On first read it appears relatively simple. 10 years later I wished I had memorized it. There are GREAT truths in even some of the smallest details of this book. You CAN'T go wrong buying it. Enjoy."
5,Great service.,"Product was in good shape and we received the shipment on time, just as expected. We would purchase from them again."
4,Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf,Hard read. Good stuff inside. Works well for some people. Great addition to Golf Book Collection.
3,Ben Hogan's Five Lessons,Some of the practices in the book are a little dated but I found the book to be very helpful. There are some techniques in the book that actually stabalized my swing. I would recommend the book for a beginning golfer as it's an easy approach to get started with sound basics.
2,poor quality,"this book is a paper back edition. I had purchased this same book for about the same price a few years back in the hard cover, and i thought that i was buying the same book. I had got it for a friend of mine so i was upset to see it was not what I had expected..."
4,Ben Hogan's Five Lessons.,Very instructive book written by a man who knows his subject and in a language one can understand. Although the bok gave some insight in Ben Hogan's thoughts of golf I wonder if there has been no development in the fundamentals of the sport over the past 30-50 years.
4,Ben Hogan's Five Lessons a must for todays golfer,"Excellent, beautifully illustrated. Will help to lower your hcp. Although must be read slowly to allow all the tips to sink in.Every Club house should have a copy."
5,Recommended by Golf Pro Instructor,"Although written before the days of home computers and the internet, the book is an excellent primer on the fundamentals of golf. The illustrations are excellent and enhance the written instructions. Our golf pro bases his lessons on those presented by Ben Hogan."
5,Simply Amazing----What a Joy to Read!,"I was a little skeptical about buying a book to help my golf game, but like all golfers, if it will help, I'll try it! I read the book in about 3 days and truly felt like Ben Hogan himself had been there taking me throught the motions of the golf swing. He breaks every movement down to a form that is easy to understand and apply. The way he presents himself gave me a sense of confidence that I could improve my game if I just followed his 5 basic principles. I am hitting longer straighter shots and for the first time I can hit my driver with minimal or zero slice.......Thank you Ben Hogan!"
3,"Very good book, but...","This is a very good book for the golf enthusiast. And I am glad I have it in my collection. BUT, I really don't think it is one of the ""best"" teaching books out there. Granted everything in the book is helpful. However, I feel it comes up short compared to many of the other books out there. I recommend buying the book if you LOVE golf and like learning ALL you can about this great game. But if you are looking for GREAT instruction/tips, this is not your best bet."
2,Very overrated book...always was,"Hogan was perhaps the greatest ball striker ever.But,he was always a poor teacher of golf.This book has made tens of thousands a slicer for life.Perhaps more gave up the game for good.Cults are never healthy"
4,Good book from past era,"This is a good golf instruction book. Of course, Hogan was a great golfer. His techniques are easy to learn. However, they require much practice and flexibility to attain. I found the following the best on helping me become a much better golfer at a much quicker pace. The book is called:The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better by Patrick Leonardiisbn--1933023090This last book has a section called the 8 essentials of the zero handicap golfer that is extremely helpful. I started to hit shots more controlled and straighter than ever before. Since using it a few months ago, I went from a 14 handicap to a 9 handicap. Every month I seem to keep improving from the help of Leonardi's book. It's well worth the money."
2,Helped a Little,"This book helped me to break 100 many years ago, but it did not help me to get out of the high 90s. Like almost all golf instruction books, it gets some things wrong. For the correct instructions for the classic golf swing, I recommend ""The Golf Swing And Its Master Key Explained"" by Noel Thomas."
3,One Man's Perspective,"There are so many great golfers who don't know why they swing the golf club well, they just know when they do. Hogan was no exception. His book is just an attempt to understand and disect something that doesn't need to be. Ironically, he didn't start playing as well as he did until he got into a car accident and damaged both his legs. He couldn't rely on the big muscles anymore, which don't have anything to do with a swinging motion anyway."
4,DEFINITE MUST READ FOR GOLFERS AT EVERY LEVEL,"Whether you're a 2 or 20 handicapper, I feel that every golfer ""serious"" about improving their game should have this series in their instructional library.Mr. Hogan teaches simple golf (ie: hands, arms, shoulders, hips <---> hips, shoulders, arms, hands). Of course it's more complicated than that but I've applied these principles and have already seen a dramatic improvement in my distance and my ball striking ability.Obviously, Mr. Hogan is no fluke instructor. He won 63 tournaments, third all-time, in his career and devoted his life to improving so you can be sure that the information is rock solid.I just wish Mr. Hogan had written more books.Enjoy!"
3,Some good instruction but not universal,"The chapters on grip, and on stance/posture are well worth studying and applying to all golfers, especially those just learning. The other chapters are worth a read, but need to be applied with caution in my opinion. Perhaps Hogan's greatest strength was the profound understanding he had of himself and his own golf swing. This is important for all golfers to achieve. Much of what he teaches in the other chapters of this book is based on this personal journey and the swing keys he discovered that worked for him. But he was barely 5 feet 8 inches tall and had a naturally flat swing. I think a dogmatic application could be a square peg in a round hole for many."
4,Ben Hogan - Five Lessons,The author goes to great lengths to describe the method to improve each part of ones golf game. Techniques are broken down to allow practice on or off the coarse. The illustrations are artful and provide a real enhancement to the lessons.
4,Very helpful to the beginner,"For someone new to the game, this book is fantastic. Very few instructional volumes will successfully tell you how a particular technique -feels-. The examples start with the grip, in which the illustrations show you (and the text accurately describes) precisely what it is that you're searching for in terms of hand contact with the club. Pictures are helpful, but they can't convey the less tangible feelings of swinging or holding the club properly. It's not a substitute for lessons by any means, but it is a good (and short) way to get yourself planted on the right track towards hitting the ball well consistently."
1,Dumb.,"I was hoping for a creepy slasher film with a decent story. What I got was just plain dumb. It starts off in the similar slasher fashion. Some horny 20 somethings on vacation in New Orleans to get plastered and laid. One of the guys just can't get over his ex so he decides to take a haunted swamp tour. The tour doesn't happen quite as planned and hijinx ensue.My major gripe with the film is the antagonist and its back story. I thought it was just something stupid and thrown together. There were definitely funny moments, but any redeeming factors were usurped by the ending. If you really wanna see it, either rent it or check it out on one of the movie channels."
2,Old school horror?,"I was extremely excited to pick this up because there weren't any screenings near me and all I heard were rave reviews about this excellent old school horror slasher flick. HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!!! It would be a good buy for under $1 but other then that don't waste your money. This film is nothing but a boring, bad acting and high cost-low budget mess."
1,Hatchet (Unrated Director's Cut) DVD Review,"Let me start off by saying that you really can't compare Hatchet to a lot of other horror movies that are being made right now. Most horror films being made right now are meant to scare, suprise, and shock people. Hatchet seems to try and make people laugh and show ridiculous splatter effects. If the purpose that you are trying to accomplish is different, you can't really compare it to movies like ""Halloween"", ""The Descent"", or ""Saw"". I happen to like horror movies that set out to scare and suprise you, so this horror movie was just not something I like to see.If you like movies like ""Dead Or Alive"" or ""The Reanimator"" then you will probably love this movie for what it is supposed to be."
1,Horrible Movie,"Please don't waste your money or time on this movie. It is by far the worst horror movie I have ever seen. Very stupid, horrible acting, and bad story. There is pointless flashing and you find yourself just laughing at the fact that someone put their money up to make this movie. You will be better off buying any other horror movie. Don't waste your money."
4,A fun take on American Horror,"While this movie is not an award winner, it is a well written, finely directed film that is fun to watch. The gore is intense, there is lots of popping out, and fans of female anatomy won't be disappointed. The script is filled with wonderful dialogue and keeps the mood lighthearted in the middle of immense chaos. Why a young man would want to leave the boob filled, beer infested, party wide environment of Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street for a ""Haunted Swamp Tour"" is beyond me, but it makes for an entertaining hour and a half.The DVD has a bunch of great special features: The trailer, several ""making of"" documentaries, commentary by the director, producer, and actors, and a gag real. This DVD is worth a look and I'm certainly glad I got it."
5,80's OLD SCHOOL HORROR - Instant Cult Classic,"This is a cult classic.With cameos from some of horrors greats, and effects from the masters of horror, Hatchet was made for the fans of the films that kept us all up at night in the 80's. Robert Englund, and Kane Hodder, lend a hand to this classic slaughterfest, Horror doesn't get much better than this. Add Hatchet to your collection, it's well worth it."
4,It was quality,"It certainly wasn't ""amazing""(say like jeepers creepers) but I think this movie was funny and classic horror(alot better than ""a nightmare on elm street""-that's overated) you should watch it somewhat(if you want something besides scary like interesting,go watch a different movie) this is just a classic horror:there's not much imagination(but there's also not that much cons either)"
2,"Blurb says ""comedy horror"". It is not.","I like horror movies that are not so predictable (unlike Friday the 13th movies). I do not like stupid characters. (How many times have I watched a movie where an idiot opens the door knowing the killer may be there?) Well, this movie is no better. The characters do incredibly stupid things.The movie is less than 90 minutes long. It is one of the shortest horror movies I've watched in a long time.The back blurb says it is a comedy/horror. It is not. This is supposed to be serious. I saw no comedy in it at all.On the plus side: The ending may not be original, but few horror movies do what this one did. I liked the ending a lot! In fact, that boost the rating up one star from me.All-in-all, this is good if you are just wanting to watch another run-of-the-mill slasher film. But there is nothing special here and the characters are incredibly predictable and do stupid moves.Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
1,There should be a zero star option,"This film was complete trash. The acting was sickening, the set was horrific and the dialogue was a disaster. Was this supposed to be some sort of Wrong Turn remake? This film was a complete waste of four dollars and I wish I could take back that eighty minutes of my life. If you are looking for a decent horror flick, try Wrong Turn.Pass on this garbage!"
3,Don't think I'll be watching this a second time.,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this tribute to 80's horror flicks.After seeing it, I'm still not sure.It's low-budget, with the requisite low-budget acting and ""special"" effects and gore. I appreciate that Hatchet is supposed to be a spoof, but it's just not quite awful enough to be bad/funny -- it's just bad/bad.Hatchet is somewhat amusing but misses the mark."
1,"Boring, but funny.","At first I want to say that I'm from Denmark, so I'm NOT good at english. Sorry for misspellings.This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen, even a 7 year-old can see it without getting scarred. It's boring, ridiculous and funny. And the funny part isn't meant good. Do not buy this movie, if you wan't to spend your money in a good way."
2,A re-telling of Friday the 13th.,"Hatchet's tag line of ""Old School American Horror"" intrigued me, especially since the films the genre has been putting out for the last 15 years have been mainly about shock rather than true horror. Unfortunately, the tagline likely refers to the fact that Hatchet is basically a rehashing of the originalFriday the 13thThe basic premise is that a group of people go into the woods on a boat tour, hear a story of a boy who took a hatchet to his deformed face and then became a ghost. Of course the boy has grown into the killer and proceeds to attack them. The only thing different between this and Friday the 13th is that the killer doesn't wait until they're alone to attack.hatchet isn't a horrible movie, and if you've never seen ""Friday the 13th"" you might enjoy it. But for everyone else it will just seem like a cheap rip-off that doesn't add anything to the original story."
2,wating for the good stuff.,"Had my hopes up for this, nice looking cover and other recomandations. But, even when I turned of the lights and try to get scared, the movie dide't cut it. Low dialog, low edeting, low acting and wierd bad dude. On the positive side, nice gore effects and you cheer when the next guy gets the Hatchet in the face!"
1,This is meant to pay tribute to 80's slasher movies - I think NOT,"I turned this off about half way through as I just couldnt stand the utter stupidity of it any longer. Maybe the sequel will be better, at least it has Danielle Harris in it."
2,"Gore for the sake of it, but great special effects","This was reviewed by my daughter, as I am not into horror films. My 17 teenage daughter, her female friends and some teen boys watched this film. It was an overtly grotesque, gory and bloody film. The boys seemed to like it, the girls not so much. The gore and such seem more enjoyed by adolescent boys, which according to my daughter, seems what the movie is aimed at. She is into special effects, therefore she did appreciate and enjoy the detail and realism of the scenes. One adult male watched this film and said if he were 15 again, he would probably enjoy all the blood and over the top death scenes, but he to felt it was over the top and horribley bloody for the shock factor. Some of the scenes were so out there as to be laughable.If you are a teenage boy or into blood and guts in a story line that is nearly non-existent, snatch this up and grab some popcorn. Otherwise go for a classic like Halloween."
2,No..no....this is all wrong.,"THE GOOD-Gore for the sake of gore-Robert England-No CGI-Nudity for the sake of nudity-Tony ToddThat's really about it.THE BAD-Everything else-Nickelodean should not make horror film's-The acting-The digital camera makes it look like a made for tv movie-The music stinks-It's not evil, dark, or scary-It's cheesy-It make's Not Another Teen movie seem cool-It's not funnyOverall it just felt like a Disney movie with gore and nudity thrown in. The great thing about the slasher's from the 70's & 80's was that they were unintentionally bad and funny. You can tell the maker's of Hatchet are completey aware of how bad it is, which really take's the fun out of the whole thing. The death scenes are good, but even that can't save this mess. 1.5 Star's."
2,Proof that human culture has hit bottom,"Let's see...dumb guys, topless girls and a rumored killer who haunts the New Orleans Bayou. The kids get lost, the madman appears, and you know the rest. Advertised as a horror film that's ""in on the joke"", I saw nothing to back up that hint of satire. Instead, the film reminds me of half the stories I used to read when I taught middle school writing. One positive for the film deals with the good use of the budget. The special effects aren't bad, and the film has a crisp, haunting look to it. But the acting is awful, and the story is worse. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, the play was great."
3,I paid 1.67 for this,"And got a whole lot more value. Is it a good movie, no. Is it a fun movie, hell yes!!!"
1,Bought as a gift.,"I do not care for this movies, yet do not judge it based on my opinion. It was bought as a gift for a friend who loves it."
1,A Complete Waste Of Time And Money,"I love a good horror and or slasher movie, unfortunately no one seems to know how to make them anymore and this movie is a perfect example of that. Bad acting, awful script, and inept directing make for a very long 90 mins. If you are thinking of buying this movie, don't. It's not even worth the rental. The ending is one of the most unsatisfying of any movie ever made. Maybe, just maybe, Hollywood or some independent filmmaker will finally create a horror movie worth purchasing, at least that's what I keep praying for. Until then we are stuck with crap like this."
1,Not Pleased,I went to play the dvd and when i pressed play it started out fine and then it stopped playing.I repeatedly try toget it to play it did the same thing.Not happy at all about this. returned item and requested a refund.
1,A total.. TOTAL waste of time,"I wanted Hatchet to be good. I read all the reviews, paying special attention to the bad ones. I waffled before buying it, and I was finally swayed by how vehemently people praised it. This movie suuuuucks. It's cheap, it's stupid, it's poorly acted, horribly written, and it looks like it was made as a school project. A few minorly interesting kills do not a worthy movie make. If you've seen the head ripping, you've seen the best part of this pile. Despite the number of likable actors, many of whom have a nice history in horror movies, you will not enjoy this movie. Please don't waste your money or time on this piece of crap."
4,Gory but ultimately forgettable,"I have a love-hate relationship with this movie. On one hand, I appreciate what the director was trying to do...sort of like a homage to old school horror flicks like Friday the 13th, Pumpkinhead, Nightmare on Elm Street etc. and the results are beautifully gory and violent. But on the other hand, the plot makes this movie highly forgettable. It will not stand beside the classics it was trying to pay homage to.I highly recommend this for fellow horror afficianods...esp. those who are willing to sacrifice plot and acting in favor of B-grade horror and special effects."
1,Comedy=Tragedy,"I love slasher movies. I was raised in a time when slasher movies were the norm and so they have been engrained in my soul. I wanted to like Hatchet, I felt I could like Hatchet, except for one thing. It's a comedy and it doesn't try to hide it. Old school horror was not trying to be funny on purpose. If this movie had just taken itself with a grain of seriousness I might have enjoyed it, but I laughed for half the movie. If you're looking for a comedy, Hatchet is for you."
1,oh my god,If I could get my money back I would ask for it. Scary movie...? I have no idea where. It had a really bad plot and falling asleep was a very good option. If you jumped at this then you have issues. I would rate this a class F movie. It sucked especially the ending
1,HATCHET IS ABYSMAL,"After all of the positive press and the occasional good reviews, i eagerly awaited hatchets release. Unfortunately the film is unwatchable. This film contains so many abysmal aspects such as, bad lighting, stupid dialouge, endless scenes of pointless boredom, and a bad script they are forced to market as a spoof...yeah right! . So like many other viewers, i was so bored i had to fast-forward to the kills....yes they are ok, but any horror fan can comfortably live without ever seeing them!Don't waste $$$ or time on this! And don't believe tha hype!"
4,Extreme Grossness!,"One of the grossest movies ever made. Script was stupid, as was the story line. The acting was really bad, but the special effects were pretty awesome and really gross. It's one of the top 10 grossest films ever made. Just make your way through the absurdity of the rest of the film, and you'll really enjoy the gory, gross parts."
5,Great first outing!,"This was a great start for Adam Green. Sure some of the acting was flat. But, the script had a ""real"" feel to it. The gore was great. Didn't use stupid CGI blood."
3,Great storyline but the acting .... well........,"Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. The story line to me is great, like the quality one's used for many 80's slasher flics (Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc...). I would have and probably should have given it a 4 star review because the film was entertaining enough despite the poor acting by some of the cast (mainly the 2 dippy wanna-be porn actresses)."
2,it's mildly entertaining,"i bought this dvd because mercedes mcnabb had some nude scenes in it. in fact, the dvd box states ""eye-popping nudity"". should of known better. the nudity was non-erotic and done in the first 15 minutes. this isn't a bad comedy/slasher movie. they definately had a budget to work with. special effects good, cameo appearances by big stars, etc. problem is, balancing the line of horror and comedy. it usually don't work because you're catering to 2 different audiences. i don't want comedy in my horror movies. if i wanted comedy, i'd buy comedies. as far as mercedes acting, she has none. her character seems to be not that much different than her buffy/angel character, harmony. there is no depth to her acting. overall, hatchet is an okay movie. in the extras, there is a talk of hatchet 2. i think i'll pass on that one."
4,HATCHET JOB,"""Hatchet"" finds a motley crew of tourists taking a midnight scare cruise in the Louisiana bayous to see ghost lights in the swamp. Soon the boat runs aground and the tourists soon run afoul of a grotesque looking maniac who picks them off one at at time sometimes two at a time. The maniac is Victor Crowley a deformed youth who is accidentally ""killed"" by his father with a hatchet blow to the face. Hence the title of the movie since the maniacs method of killing his victims is to literally tear them apart including one victims' face torn apart.This film has no high aspirations other than to show trapped victims being slaughtered in increasingly gross ways and in this respect the movie is a complete success. Well done for this type of movie but be warned the blood and guts, the dismembered limbs, and the heads go flying about in wild abandon. And for those who care there's even a hungry alligator in one scene."
4,directors ''cut''.......nice,"this was exactly what i expected.a spoof of 80's horror movies without being overly conscience of that fact.ridiculously over the top gore,inept acting,dreadful script and gratuitous nudity/lesbianism (yum).the gist~a deformed maniac is hunting humans.he is taking out revenge for when he was tormented as a child.all who enter,and i mean ALL,his swamp gets destroyed.of course this guy is indestructable and is able to tear people apart.arent all those who are bullied and deformed ????if leslie vernon had 5 % of what hatchets has,it would have been a better movie.i mention this because that too was a ''spoof'' on 80's horror that failed to get past the spoofing.im hoping his swamp has an unending supply of body bag fillers."
1,do not watch,this movie is very very bad the special effects make this film look like something filmed by high school students. Do not listen to the other reviews this film is bad
4,A surprisingly good film,"You could almost call ""Hatchet"" ""Gilligan's Island meets Friday The 13th"". The story is simple enough, a group of tourists on a New Orleans Haunted Swamp tour end up lost in the woods with hatchet wielding maniac. What sets ""Hatchet"" apart from others in the genre is it's sense of humor. This probably the first slasher comedy. It's not a spoof however, there are some moments where you'll find yourself jumping and the gore level is high. Overall I liked the movie, it's bloody, it's gory, the plot has been used a hundred times, but it's fun.The disc also has several documentaries about the film with the filmmakers. Among them is the story of how 80's hair band Twisted Sister lead singer Dee Snider plays into the whole making of the movie.""Hatchet"" is a slasher film that doesn't take it's self to serious and cuts right to the juggular."
3,"Old School American Horror, kind of","From the gory opening, it becomes quickly apparent that the quality of this movie, if any, will lie with the ""shock"" material rather than with the story or the production. The movie ducks in and out of being excessively cheesy and is saved only somewhat by the raging and deformed character of Victor Crowley. The story of our villain is fairly amusing and compelling, although not all that creative.I certainly do not feel that this character will live up to the quote on the front of the DVD box and become ""the next icon of horror"", but the movie is fun for viewing, with a mixture of comedy and horrendous (almost to the point of being laughable) murder scenes.This is a movie that has to be enjoyed for what it is... It seems to be a throwback to the days of Freddy and Jason, as admitted by the Writer/Director in the bonus material."
4,Stack-n-whacker Quilts,Bethany approach to do Kaleidoscope quilts is very easy to follow. This book has new ideas and even if you have already one of her books this has new patterns and even if you have not her beginner book it still helps you to make 'fast' beautiful fun quilts since her instruction are easy to follow .
5,The Waiting is Over,We have all heard about this wonderful book and now it is available...I have really enjoyed reading through this wonderful new addition for StacknWhack fans...The instructions are great and the photos and piecing details are so very helpful. I would recommend this book to everyone's collection...The fans & Butterflies are calling my fabric now.....
5,Book purchase,I received my book in excellent condition in very timely manner. Would reccomend to anyone.
5,Another Wonderful Book,"This book continues with Bethany's wonderful methods of transforming fabric into great kaleidoscopic blocks. The directions are extremely well written for use, even by people who have never done Stack&Whack quilt blocks before.I love the new shapes that Bethany is using, since I can use smaller amounts of my fabrics with some of the easier shapes.I'll be amazing my friends soon with some more wonderful quilts from these patterns!!"
4,Stack-n-Whackier Quilts,"As an experienced quilter, I look for challenges and interesting attacks to different quilting techniques. This book is written clearly enough for an advanced beginner but provides enought challenge for an advanced quilter. Well done, interesting, and fun."
4,"a funny, iconoclastic, ribald, romp. GREAT!!","This book should be on every shelf in Philadelphia, in every Catholic family's library, and every man who, at one time, was a teen-ager. It reads in one risible, enjoyable, poignant evening. Wonderful!!"
3,A bearable life story -- but it's 100 pages too long,"All right, Tony Pasquarello says up front that this book is not about Altar Boy pranks, or other mischief that boys get into in his Philadelphia neighborhood.And for the first 100 pages or so, the author's hindsight and commentary, although annoying, is tolerable, because the writing is crisp and sharp and you think it's going to take you somewhere interesting.But when Tony hits puberty his urges take over not only the young boy, but this biography as well. Consider it a Portnoy's Complaint with pasta.And there's the rub, pardon the pun, but how can anyone recommend this book to anyone else? You interested in history, or Italians in Philadelphia? Don't bother with this book - unless you just read the first 100 pages. As for the next 100 pages or so, it's so distracting, you'll lose any insight you might have found in the front of the book.So, sadly, keep your mind blank and pass on The Altar Boy Chronicles."
3,Hanyes missed something,This is a fine book but I think there are some issues. I referanced OIL COOLER and tried to turn to the index page and it just isn't there. I bought the BMW manual on disc and I find it VERY helpfull. It doesn't offer hand holding of the Haynes . But between the two and stuff people posted on the net I can tacle any job. J.Michael
1,does not work,"I did not buy this item but another brand from off site seller. Same width zinc rolls. The moss continues to grow. I should say that zinc does work. You may see moss free swath of roof under the pipe or chimney flashing. I am going to try much cheaper 10"" roll of galvanized flashing from homedepot.I've read that not all zinc are same. Maybe these zinc rolls are not chemically same as zinc from galvanized flashings. These narrow width rolls also may not have enough surface area for rain to wash down enough zinc."
1,1 Roll of Z-Stop is over-priced,"Another review implied that there are 3 rolls shipped, which is incorrect. I ordered this and recieved one 50 foot roll.A local hardware store (McLendons) is selling this exact same product for $20, which is less than it is being sold here and definitely less than the $150 price Amazon listed it being marked down from."
5,Great product,This is bigger than I expected. I can fit about 7 horse pills in this thing or about 10-12 regular size pills. Fairly sturdy and very convenient.
5,Good buy,"For long we had been prone to forgetting one dose or another of a host of vitamins and supplements. There were more expensive boxes available at CVS and other stores, however, this box is a great buy for it's price. It has good roomy compartments, the size of the box is easy to carry on a travel. I had read some reviews that the box does not close well and the pills may drop out, but I have not faced any such difficulty."
3,"Apex Weekly Pill Organizer, Twice-a-Day, 1 Pill Organizer (Colors May...",Some of the covers do not stay snapped shut . I like having the 2 different colors. The price was right.
2,I wanted a bigger pill organizer,"The picture shows an XXL pill organizer. With all the new vitamins chews, I am really looking for an XXL pill organizer. If it is just pills or tablets, you're fine. Oh well, I am squishing in all the soft chewy vitamins. The lids stay shut half of the time. If you pack this container (I travel for work), they do not stay closed even in a ziplock bag."
2,"Spacious, but breaks easily","Worked great until it broke. The compartments are nicely labeled, easy to open and close, and hold about 5-6 large capsules. They shut fairly tightly. Unfortunately, one spill off the counter snapped off two of the doors. It can still be used, but those doors are now inconvenient and pop off at the slightest provocation. The inserts holding all the doors also slide out very easily, although they can be glued down. Useless for travel because the doors break off and fall open so easily. Not recommended."
4,WEEKLY PILL ORGANIZER,If you take a lot of vitamin and prescription drugs daily this dispenser is the ideal one for you.I refill it once a week and then I do not forget my pills.
4,Works fine,"This pill organizer does what you buy one of these for. I paid a little over 5 bucks with free Prime shipping, which is probably what you would pay in the drug store. It's roomy, more space than we needed and we haven't had any problems."
4,Good Customer Service,"I must admit that my first experience was less than perfect. Apex Healthcare products sent me the wrong product by USPS. As it was not an expensive item, I didn't bother to return it. (I had just had ankle surgery.) What I did, however, was to complain and the owner himself called me immediately and set the situation aright. And so, it took longer than I might have liked, but it all worked out very well in the end."
1,Poor quality,Lasted only three months before the lid came off of one of the compartments and can't be reattached. Looking for a sturdier product. Won't buy again.
2,"Great Size, Cheap Construction","I love the size of this product and the ability to fill 14 compartments in one organizer. Unfortunately my son knocked it off a desk less than 3 feet tall and the corner compartment flap broke right off. It was closed and empty because I had yet to use it. very disappointed. i looked closer at the hinges and i wouldn't be surprised if more hinges break just from use, as they are very thin and weak."
2,huge,"much larger than I expected. will work for craft projects, but much too big for the 5 pills I take daily."
4,Roomy Pill Box,"Works as it should, is roomy and holds a huge number of pills per compartment, even several large ones like vitamins. The lids can be removed for cleaning, the compartments are contoured for easy pill removal.A drawback for me is the fact that the lids open too easily. Therefore, this is a pill organizer best suited for the countertop at home but not for travel because the contents would be spilled very quickly. Other than that: Good product."
1,Poor design,"I bought this pill organizer for traveling and was very disappointed. The closures on each slot are so weak that you have to hold them all closed when you open one, else all the pills come tumbling out. I bought it at WalMart which is an hour away, so of course won't go to the trouble of returning it, but can warn others here."
3,"Nice concept, bad closure design.",Love the idea of keeping pills in A.M. and P.M. for easy sorting. The problem with this item is that it doesn't really lock when you close the compartment as some of the other pill cases do. That is my only problem.
2,"Lid not secure, wrong color","This is a good idea, but has design flaws.1. The lids do not stay closed. They come open much too easily. I have had pills spill out.2. The compartments are white and opaque. Many of my pills are white and tiny. I have a hard time seeing if I got the right pills in there. I bought this because it had the dual am/pm design. My previous one was a single and I had to use 2 and remember which was am and which was pm. This is better in that way, but the others were a darker color so I could see light-colored pills better. They were also transluscent, so I could see from the bottom.The removable covers are good for cleaning and filling, but the flaws outweigh the benefits.February 4, 2008 Update: Two of the 3 units I bought are now broken. The lids on a couple of the compartments will no longer stay closed. They have not been dropped or damaged in any way. This product is defective. If I could reduce my rating, I would."
1,Pill Organizer,The organizer arrived broken and more compartments started to break as I used it. I realize they were inexpensive but I thought they would last for awhile. Obviously they didn't. Poor product.
4,This is a MULTI-pill organizer !,"The description of this pill organizer is not accurate. They call it a ""1 pill organizer"", but each compartment is actually big enough to hold several pills of the size of a regular Centrum (for example). It is true that the lids pop open under moderate strain, such as might be caused by packing this organizer in an overnight bag. So I would not recommend it for travel use, but it is perfect for counter-top use at home, even if you take 5 or 6 medium size pills twice a day each."
2,Defective item,"The product received is a very defective piece , the bottom of the box broken and there is a hole in it and the packaging is also not done well. It is not worth for the money paid."
2,Weak doors,"Door hinges are just thinned areas in the plastic, which become brittle with use. On mine the first door broke off in about 9 months. Also, doors open easily by accident. I had to wrap mine with a rubber band when traveling to keep pills from spilling."
5,Pill Organizer,This works well for my situation. I needed a 2 week organizer. I know it's advertised as a twice a day but I use it for 2 weeks. Each compartment is large to handle 6 large pills easily and then have room for the other stuff. I like it a lot - - no more cramming and stuffing pills to make them fit
2,Loose Lids,Lids don't stay closed! Otherwise OK! Have been using similar ones for years. These not as good. Still usable though
4,It works!,"I dont have much to say about this pill box. It works as described. It is very roomy and holds all the pills I need. The only complaint I have is the same as other, the doors do not close very tightly. I do not think you would want to use this for travel since the doors would easily pop open."
3,Get what you pay for,"Check with your insurer or mail order pharmacy -- as of two years ago Cigna provided these free of charge. Blue Shield of CA does not.Pros: inexpensive, easy to clean, easy to load, helps avert missed doses, keeps pills dry in a humid (bathroom counter) environmentCons: flimsy top -- need to be extremely careful when traveling, one flap (out of fourteen) has broken out of everyday wear and tear."
5,good,this is good --- it holds a lot of pills and the two colors make it easy to distinguish between am and pm ---
4,What I was looking for....,I was satisfied with this pill box. There is plenty of room for all my different vitamins and pills. The lids stay closed pretty well too.
5,APEX PILL ORGANIZER,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ITEM SINCE NOV 2005. I HAVE HAD ONLY ONE OCCASION WHEN ANOTHER COVER OPENED AT SAME TIME OPENING ONE I NEED. AFTER 3yrs I FINALY AM AT THE POINT I NEED TO REPLACE AS THE PLASTIC HINGES ARE WORE OUT. I WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER SOON. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.
2,Tops snap off easily,"The plastic tops don't have proper hinges - they're just creased plastic, so break very easily. I've had two of these, because it's all my local drugstore sells, and both had at least one missing top within 2 months of gentle use. I can't imagine these lasting more than a few months for anyone. If you buy it, consider it ""disposable""."
1,only used it once,This box is not a good choice because it does not snap well. It also is hard to fill as the insert comes out too easily. My box ended up in the trash as I didn't even want to pass it along to the thrift shop.
1,crappy,"The plastic hinge on each compartment must be .0000001 microns thin; after 1 weeks use (keep in mind the compartment is opened once to fill and closed to seal), 3 of the lids broke off. We threw the darn thing away. Like I said, crappy quality. My suggestion, buy another product."
4,Ordinary Pill Organizer,"This pill organizer is nothing special. I had one that looked just like this, but the lids actually came off so you could organize the days. I find it annoying, for some reason, that the days are opposite (on the other side of Sunday, it will say Saturday, etc.), which I'm not used to, so I always think I've missed doses when I haven't. Otherwise, they close tightly, and there's a lot of space (It could probably fit about 4-5 multi-vitamins."
3,took this to india,"i took this to india and it worked great, and i didnt get sick. I would have liked for the life to last longer as it would run out of batteries pretty quickly."
2,"Works, but is delicate","I took this filter on my Appalachian Trail hike in 2005, and it broke within the first 100 miles. I followed all instructions, kept it in its special pouch, etc. I even sang to it. It worked great for a few days, worked intermittently for a few more days, and then quit on me. I took it back for a refund.It works, but it is too delicate for long distance backpacking. I'd recommend a filter, or better yet, a chemical purifier (e.g., iodine, Aqua Mira)."
5,Techno/House fans take notice,"I have owned this CD nearly since the original release date. Of course 808 State has had many great releases over the years, but this could be the most important of them all. From a technoloy standpoint, this album was years ahead of many others. It was recorded before it was cool to sport your Dad's Mini-Moog. Also, their name came via Roland's TR-808 drum-machine. The analog outboard gear rears its ugly head throughout the album. Take note in Pacific 212 with the TR 909 beats. This is definitely a must have for all interested in knowing where techno and house came up out of Manchester, England and Detroit. This gets five thumbs up."
4,It's a gasket,Fits the Stant 13758 Thermostat does not leak. Not much left to say. These are the seven additional that are required
3,Robert Mitchum,I really like Thunder Road.I didn't realize he sang so many songs.Not all my taste but worth it.Glad I got it
2,NOT PC READABLE,PLAYS FINE ON A COMMON CD PLAYER.I WANTED TO PUT IT ON MY SANSA CLIPPBUT TWO SEPARATE COMPUTERS AND 3DIFFERENT DRIVES COULD NOT READ ITOR PLAY IT.
1,trash,Why is Amazon selling this garbage? This CD advocates the assaination of Halliburton executives and the Vice-president of the US. The proceeds go to groups that treasonous organizations that advocate killing both Americans soldiers and Iraqis. I won't be buying anything from Amazon until they stop selling this trash!
1,WHERE ARE YOU???,"I would love to have this book for my collection but I am having a hard time finding any printed copies. Seeing as this band is breaking all kinds of records with ticket sales with thier current tour ""Red, White & Crue"" I suspect there will be a high demand for rare out of print books like this one.The fans demand they put more in stock so we can buy them."
2,The cinnamon flavor in the bars was just ...,"The cinnamon flavor in the bars was just right. And they do seem to get me through a quick lunch at work. However, they are unbelievably SWEET! I wouldn't use them because of this reason. I would compare taking a bite of these to putting a teaspoon of sugar in your mouth."
2,I was very enthused by these till I ...,"I was very enthused by these till I actually ate them. The first three bites were okay, but after that I couldn't keep eating. The added Raisin/Oatmeal flavoring is way too strong. I have had other types of meal-on-the-go bars and actually liked them. But these aren't that great."
2,Good to watch but false advertising.,"This video is NOT about ""Advanced Heavy Weather Boat Handling"", but does demonstrate in several ways how to cross a specific bar in Australia. I don't doubt, however, that much of the information can be applied in other locations and situations."
2,Interesting idea let down by paper-thin characters,"When taking Masterton's other horror books into consideration, ""The Doorkeepers"" is a decidedly average novel. The idea of parallell worlds isn't exactly original, but its presentation in this novel is interesting, although let down severely by poorly developed characters and unlikely situations. The only reason we have for liking the main character is that he shares a special relationship with animals, Masterton doesn't really expand past that. The other characters are forgettable and the villains are stock standard. The book ends with an unexciting climax. A let down."
1,Repeat plots,"I picked up this book after looking at the reviews given at this site. I have to say I am extremely disappointed. One thing that bothered me the most is that the author seems to have the same basic plot across different books i.e the house that jack built, prey, and of course, the doorkeepers. The plot being time travel/dimension travel. Oh one more thing that is common is that the characters seem kind of stupid. They will do things that they shouldn't and then they die because of what they did.The book started out well, with reasonable suspense. But then it became absurd, with different Londons and what not.The only book I liked was Trauma and maybe A terrible beauty."
3,not simple,"although the NNS is designed to simplify how to read or in place of reading STD. music notation, I'm not sure it clarifies it for me. I've mulled over the chord chart and don't see any advantage as opposed to just learning the chords and shapes thoroughly. I play the bass guitar and i haven't seen yet how to apply the System to an advantage. It may be that my skill level isn't up to the level that is needed to use the system effectively. However I'm using the TAB sys. which I've found to be easier than reading STD. music notation. It tells me exactly where to go on the fretboard............"
3,the nashvillen number system,complicated Im not all the way throught it yet theres allot to learn in a maneul like this one so it takes time
1,disappointed in 3M steri strips,"My doctor used these on my arm and because my skin rips VERY easily I wanted to have some here at my home. When they arrived (2 packages of them) I used some right away. I noticed that they were white and not the skin color my doctor uses but thought that is not a problem. I put several on just like the doctor did and within an hour, all of them were off! I had no lotion on and my arms were clean after wiping them with alcohol pads.I always thought that 3M made good products and I am really disappointed in these. They are worthless to me!3M STERI STRIP SKIN CLOSURES 1/8'' X 3'' 10 PKG/5"
4,good old rubber spatulas,"I searched everywhere to find a kitchen spatula that was NOT the new stiff silicone kind, the ones that are absolutely useless when scraping a bowl. But - after much searching and phone calls - the Vermont Country Store actually called me back and said that while they were not in their catalogs, they did have them in stock. They are the best!"
2,Expensive.,"I was excited to receive this item, but it wasn't the quality I expected from Rubbermaid...not enough to send it back though."
4,small,"This is a good sturdy spatula, but it's a little small. It works good for small jobs, but I usually need a bigger one."
4,Good Sturdy Spatula,"These are good sturdy one-piece spatulas. By one piece, I mean the flexible paddle end is molded to the handle, so you won't find it stuck in your cookie dough while you are still holding the handle. Speaking of the handle, this is the one flaw. It is well made, but just too short, by maybe one inch or so. So it is a good strong utensil, marred only by Rubbermaid trying to shave a few cents off the cost of making them by shortening the handle too much. With all the ergonomic research that has been done regarding the human hand, mistakes like these are astonishing. Prepare for mayonnaise on your knuckles when scraping the bottom of a big jar. Otherwise, this item should last many years."
4,Well made very stiff blade,"I like the way the head is attached to the handle so there is no crack where crude can accumulate in the seam. The blade is very short, stiff and very much like a knife with little flex. Its a good spatula as was mentioned for cakes and scraping the sides of bowls. At a 9 1/2"" handle it is shortish."
1,Not my taste,Handle way too short. Size of Spatula rubber was good but handle falls short of expectations very disappointed
4,Satisfied,"I am satisfied with this purchase. I bought this product because it advertised a 350 lb max user weight capacity. I'm 6'7 320lbs so sturdiness is very important to me. The dip bar is too narrow for me to use however I really only purchased it for the leg raise function. The assembly instructions aren't very good which makes putting the machine together a bit of a pain. With all of that said I am happy with the finished product, it is very sturdy."
4,Excellent,"Excellent Product. But Manual is a bit confusing(the screws and nuts). But common sense will tell you how to set it up (All brawn, no brain to whoever wrote the manual).A tip, Count all the screws, nuts, washers, every accessories provided. Then separate them and named each piece the number as the manual. That way might save you time.Another tip. Is that when setting up the stand, make sure you don't lock the nuts tightly. Also, use the washers provided. After all is set, then screw all the nuts tightly. Otherwise, you will have a hard time setting it up, specially the pull-up bar.The machine does wabble a bit, but is not that serious. I'm 5'4"" and weigh roughly 160 lbs. Now, I'm feeling like, I want to do more exercise. It's a wonderful machine the only machine that I'm missing is a walker =(. Perhaps I'll go jogging in my college campus."
3,made with good material/not good engineering,good material used on product....i tried a knee raise at the 24 hour fitness ....way better than this one....it most likey exsplanes the price...should have got the name bran....any time you get something like this you got to want to get on it.....the arms are way too far apart on this one....no adjustments...again the back rest could prop you in a better angle for back sapport....upset with the pads for the elbow rests.....better than nothing ...you could get a great work out to strenthen your core with the large ball instead of this....again with me on this knee raise that never does core work outs and 210 lbs...it did not have the spark like the one at 24 hr fitness...
2,Disappointing,"We bought this item for our daughter for Christmas last year. When it arrived, it turned out that the pendant was nearly microscopic in size. It was also on a very flimsy chain, which broke almost immediately. Disappointed, and not recommended for kids."
1,michelle,Beyond disappointed. we bought this for our daughter for her birthday and returned it immediately.the pendant is sooooo tiny it is hard to see on the necklace.
4,Exactly what I needed,"This book is now old, but was a trailblazing book in its time. I needed a fundamental relation between the statistical confidence when a sequence of tests is done. This relation had eluded me for years. This book has that relation as one of its jewels.The book is laid out so a practical, handbook-style search will yield results in the first half, with the rigor and derivations in the second half of the book."
5,Works With Windows XP,"Me and my mom bought the RIS 2.0 and it really does work with XP.All you do is call the LEGO support line, and follow the instructions, or you can get the instructions off the internet."
4,A lot better than other lego Mindstorms systems,"I think this Lego Mindstorms system is a lot better than the Robotics Discovery system which I also own, because it has a much larger variety of commands and has more ports on the RCX and other new features on the RCX."
5,Lego Mindstorms,"i just got this for christmas, and i thought it was a wonderful toy. I can sit there and build for hours and i loves it. I would recomend it to anyone. It is also very durable. I accedentally droped the RCX of of a table and it still works perfectally. Thanks"
5,Excellent Toy,"This set is impressive. Can spend hours with it. If I could, I would just add a rather unexpensive sound sensor, to trigger commands with sounds, like claps, etc."
5,Speaks for itself,MindStorms and the internet communities that have evolved around it will be instrumental in changing the Robotics landscape for ever
2,Beware of software incompatibilty,"Unless you have Windows 98 or Windows ME, it may not work (who knows -- you may get lucky). I refuse to use either of these operating systems, which I consider wretched. The Mindstorm official FAQ says it was tested only on those 2 operating systems. For those who can get it to work, apparently it's a great product."
4,got it for xmas...,the cd/rcx is annoying me- I had a hard time with dowloading and now for some reason I have to do it again but otherwise this thang is a beast!
4,Lego Mindstorms is a Blast!,This toy is fun for ages of ten and up. The possibilities are endless and even older kids will have fun creating programs that can make a simple robotic machine thats functions are only limited by the lego pieces available (there a lot) and their own creative ability.
3,Invacare thumb spling--medium,"The advantages of this is that it is black and does not show dirt and will fit a size small or medium. There is not enough wrist support, but the thumb band is adjustable to allow for joint swelling. It is more adjustable than the Futuro splint and less expensive. Therefore, only three stars."
4,so far a big help,"I wasn't sure at first if I'd like it because the wrist part can seem to add to pain, but that didn't last and using it while I sleep has really helped. Very adjustable and works for either hand. Glad I got it."
4,Comfortable. Good price.,I sometimes have some pain from arthritis in my thumbs especially after I've been raking or painting for a while as well as when I use the computer. So far I've tried the invacare on both thumbs while typing and no pain at all. They are supported well. The product is light weight and doesn't get in the way. I recommend them.
2,Product review,"I have arthritis in both thumbs, the left having been operated on three years ago. I am right handed and don't intend to have surgery on my right thumb. I use various thumb braces. What I expect from them after having paid a reasonable price is rest for the joint so I can be free of pain from random, inadvertent joint movements. This product, while reasonably priced, is too loosely designed to provide true rest for the joint. Further it is completely plastic in composition meaning that after even a short wearing I have a lot of sweat. I would not buy this product again at any price."
5,comfortable and works perfectly,the brace is perfectly comfortable and relieves the tendonitis at the base of my thumb. It also allows my hand to move in all the ways I want it to.
1,Little support,"I do not feel like this thumb spica kept my thumb straight, as I thought it would. After purchasing this I ended up getting a brace with a metal strip inside to keep the thumb from bending. I'm really not sure what this one would ever to to help someone."
1,More cumbersome than therapeutic.,"This spica splint offered NO help for support or immobilization of my thumb. The velcro fastens at the wrist and at the thumb but at no spot inbetween. Any movement of the thumb, hand or wrist causes the parts of the brace between the two points of contact to gap. That allows movement. This brace seemed nothing but cumbersome during the few try-on moments before I returned it. It did apparently help others. Was I using it wrong? Who knows. The promised instructions weren't really inside after all.I think I'll end up going back to the physical therapy hand specialist to have a brace molded specifically to my hand. It will be water proof, washable, durable and offer proper support of my arthritic thumb base so pain can be relieved. Sure glad I still have medical insurance."
2,Product makes you sweat.,I liked the price. Product supported my finger but I perspired all night wearing it. There is no cotton inside to absorb perspiration.
3,Invacare IB Thumb Spica Large - X-Large,"I like the comfort and the gentle support. There is a slight design flaw that I'm not sure how it could be fixed. The fabric that lays belos the thumb onto the palm ""sags"" a bit. It gets in the way but not so much that it's cumberson. Just a bit of an annoyance. I like that I can type with ease while wearing it and that's what I was looking for. I have arthritis in my thumb joint and this definatley helps."
3,Might be good for some,"I bought this because, to be honest, it was black. I have osteoarthritis in my thumb joint and my hand gets worked ALOT in my line of work. The brace from my Dr. (hard plastic) hurts my thumb after time, my other OTC braces are nude/taupe color and get dirty really quickly. This brace fits well, I have smaller hands and really small wrists, however, it doesn't really offer that much thumb support as there is only one ""stay"" that runs along the outside of the thumb, I wish it had one on all sides, there is also isn't anything at the bottom of the opening for the stay, so it can tend to work itself out. I'll continue to use it, alternating w/my others until I probably go for the surgery."
4,Works Great,"Brought this because I have a bad case of Tendinitis at the base of my wrist near the thumb. Brace is comfortable and keeps the thumb from moving back towards the wrist. Very flexible and allows one the use of his hand to work and even play guitar. Brace is hand washable and the support is a thin metal bar this slides into a pouch aligned with the thumb. A tab of Velcro wraps around and secures the thumb along with a band of Velcro which wraps around the wrist. Had it for a month and appears to be well made. It will take a bit of experimenting to determine how tight to warp the thumb section I notice if I wrap it too tight the thumb will ""fall asleep"" or become numb. Fairly inexpensive compared to similar products. I would recommend it to anyone wishing to keep the thumb from bending towards the wrist and still allow the full use of your hand."
5,Very nice spica splint,If your doctor prescribes a spica thumb splint buy this one. It's easy on easy off. I wore it doing some yard work last weekend and got it dirty and sweaty. No problem a little warm water and mild soap and it's like new again. Very impressed.
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"After my initial recovery from an RCL tear in my left thumb (7 weeks in a cast, 8 weeks in a removable hard splint, and 11 weeks of OT), I was looking for a brace that would support my thumb but allow movement of my wrist. I'm pretty active in exercise(swimming, yoga, Pilates, aerobics, water aerobics, weight training), so I needed something that I could wear while doing these activities. The Invacare IB Thumb Spica did not meet my needs. It did not offer the support I was looking for and it was a bit clunky (not form fitting)."
2,splint,"The product was shipped extremely quickly. But the product did not work for me. Depending on your hand size and what type of issue you are having, it may work for you."
3,AMERICAN GENERAL IDEAS,A bit dated but still contains many good STARTING points to explain what America can mean to the new Russian Language immigrant. It really needs an update to reflect the many changes since the 911 attack.
4,I love it,This is a great album. Beats me what the lyrics are about. An Italian friend of mine said they're banal. I don't care. The whole thing is as tight as a drum with brilliantly constructed melodies and excellent vocals. Think Pixies or Smashing Pumpkins with better vocals. The only thing spoiling this album for me is the last track which ironically enough is a cover of the Cure. They should have skipped it and given me another of their own tracks. What's singular about this CD is the subtle undertone of angst and I don't know... menace? There's a fine complexity to it. It reminds me a little of the first two Police albums in this regard. Anyway it's a year later and I'm still listening to it regularly. Stichazzi!
2,didn't work for me,"this shampoo made my dandruff even worse. after using it, it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed, but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it. if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell's tea tree shampoo or something."
2,No changes!,"I have been struggling with dandruff for years. After using Nizoral for about 6-7 weeks, I can't see any huge improvements, but only subtle reduction of dandruff. It may work miracles for you, but that wasn't the case for me."
3,My head seems so sensitive that I have ...,"My head seems so sensitive that I have to use products that don't cause it to flare up. I usually get itching on my scalp and eyebrows. I normally use Head & Shoulders for Dry Scalp but I thought I would give this product a try. I seemed to make my head itch more than usual. But if your scalp isn't as sensitive as mine, then this shampoo would be for you. It did leave my hair softer than Head & Shoulders but it didn't have a nice smell. I would at least try it for yourself."
4,This shampoo worked really well. Unlike other shampoos ...,"This shampoo worked really well. Unlike other shampoos for dandruff or dry scalp, this shampoo smells refreshing and does control itching and flaking. I like the fact that it recommends using it every three to four days for eight weeks and then using it only as needed after that. The pricing may seem a bit high for the product; however, it does its job, so it's worth it. I would recommend this product."
4,The best yet,"The best dandruff shampoo I have found although I have not tried the coal tar shampoos yet. I have really long hair and nizoral is very mild, I normally use Matrix products so I was impressed. It takes about two or three washes over time to really knock it out. If it did it in one wash I would give it a five although I don't think such a product exists. About coal tar shampoos, the coal tar in most if not all of these shampoos is dissolved in alcohol. Alcohol is really hard on your hair."
4,"""Look Mom""","Before I started taking Arthx I could not make a fist. Now, ""Look Mom"" I can make a fist""! I would give this product a chance before going out and by any type of pain reliever."
5,Easy for stomach,"My mom is 60 years old. She has a weak stomach. I know that gluecosamine can occur something uncomfortable to a stomach. But this one doesn't. Right after eating it, my mom feels a little uncomfortable. But soon, she feel better. Very good."
3,Kitchen knives,Very nice quality knife set. Knives have stayed pretty sharp for the couple of years that I have had them. The only thing I don't like is the handles. They're made from a plastic mold. Not so high quality looking.My wife accidently put one handle near the fire on the stove and the handle melted some. I would probably spend a little more and get higher quality handles.
2,Disappointing,This knife set was a huge disappointment. The quality of the blades and especially the handles was poor. We returned the set.
5,"Deeply Satisfied, thank you","This was the first book I ever read from Steven Forrest- and it surely won't be the last. He has a personality that can make a deep dark planet like Pluto come alive. The book is aptly titled The book of Pluto,TURNING DARKNESS TO WISDOM--- I totally get that part- turning darkness to wisdom, as this is what he does in the book. The way he writes is lively, he has way to tell wise stories that do not put you in the dark as Pluto is known for. The stories shine a light on the darkness, after all when you are in the dark, it is kinda hard to see. The book is very honest & encouraging. I would recommend this highly, as it is one of my favorites."
5,Steven Forrest- a living legend,"Steven Forrest is an astrological legend. He writes in an easy style, casual and easy to grasp. Its like a friend trying to explain usually complicated interpretations and techniques, trying to keep the mood light in a subject as heavy as pluto. There is a strong emphasis on the esoteric understanding of the planet, aspects, and its transits, with a focus on empowerment and awareness. People make pluto transits out to be so tough. Glad I read his book when I needed it most. This book shows have choices, can decide on strategies that work, and can use the time or aspect to our advantage."
2,Rife with errors,"Where were the editors of this edition? There is a typographical error on almost every page of this book. The publishers should be embarrassed by this, and I can only imagine Don Marquis must be turning over in his grave. I'd first read this charming book many years ago, and I wanted a copy for myself and to show to a few others whom I'd thought might appreciate it, but I wouldn't share this book with anyone without the caveat that the publishers are doing a great disservice to the original material. Shame on you!"
5,Great show!,Ordered for my mom and my grandma and they really enjoyed it alot! Something for birthday presents in the future!
4,Brings back great memories!,I remember listening to these songs on AM radio back in the 60s. Especially on the beach at Coney Island. And on the radio at home. They don't make songs like these anymore.
5,Great CD,"There's not much to say about this album, but it was a perfect Christmas gift for my mom. I grew up listening to these tunes and I'll continue to listen to them for the rest of my life. Although this doesn't COMPLETELY sum up the 60s, it does a good job providing you with the big hits."
1,Hard to find fonts.,"This book is creatively written, but has been really no use to me in finding specific fonts. I wish the book were laid out with the same sentence ""The Quick Fox Jumped Over the Lazy Brown Dog"" instead of a bunch of free-flowing sentences. I'm not able to find fonts in this book because I can't pinpoint a single letter."
1,Meh.,"It's an ok book as a reference. The book is actually a huge story about nothing and every sentance is a different font face. The fonts are organized by style which is nice but when you find the font you want and there isn't an example of the letter you need, it's a little disappointing. I would have benefited more from the book showing A-Z and a-z in each font vs. the big story."
2,"Funny book to read for fun, not good reference book","Funny, but not useful. I found the fonts and then looked where he said to. The companies and font names were not there."
5,Another classic from Peattie.,"Another classic from the great writer/naturalist.This is Peattie's non-technical history of flowering plants,beautifuly written and highly educational,but you don't need to have a degree in botany to understand it.Highly recomended for all nature lovers."
1,don't waste your money,"This book comprises 49 A5-size pages, of which about 30 pages contain information in 12pt, 1.5 line space text. There is not ONE photograph or illustration in the entire book! It reminds me of one of Mad Magazine's famous thin books.A complete and utter waste of money. To add insult to injury, Amazon screwed-up my shipping - this book ended up costing me $25 in shipping alone! Aaaarrggghhhh..."
1,"Don't Buy, all EROS discs are defective","This is not a review about the film (unfortunately I was unable to watch it) but about the hardware defect.Three times I purchased this title from two different sellers and all three times I received a defective disc from EROS entertainment. The discs were new and all had interupted sound and no picture throughout the whole film. No skipping forward, reinserting or playback in three different players helped. So if you would like to save yourself a hazzle - don't buy."
1,Very slow to brighten--try another brand,"Getting a fluorescent replacement for globe lights is an excellent idea (incandescent globes are extremely poor for lumens per watt, worse than conventional incandescent bulbs). But this TCP model is very poor. I got 4 of them and they all put out almost no light for about a minute, and don't reach full brightness until 3 or 4 minutes. This is inexcusable. A modest warm-up delay is OK in a fluorescent, but this is unacceptable.Try another brand. I found, for example, a Philips is good.Other TCP bulbs may be OK--I have a TCP 4 watt G20 globe, candelabra base, that doesn't have this warmup problem. The problem seems specific to this size.Light Bulbs etc. etc. was very nice, and accepted a return of the bulbs I had a problem with."
1,They fooled me!,"if you get this movie because of Jackie, you'll spend the whole time thinking, now where's Jackie. Actually, you only get to see him in the edited footage with him smoking ( a terrible habit he's quit)! But he is the stunt coordinator, and that is why they can advertise him."
4,"Even without Jackie in the film, it's still darn good.","Jackie Chan only directed and choreographed the movie, but it doesn't meen the movie itself is a waste. I felt the movie was directed great by chan, and the fight scenes were very ammusing, along with some funny and interesting characters. Jackie should direct more films like this. I reccomend this to anyone, especially to jackie fans, this was some of his best work (maybe even if it was directing). And in my mind it's not the stars in the movie but tha action, styles, and entertainment. Go see this one."
3,Great book for those new to guitar playing,"I just recently got a guitar as a gift. I knew nothing about guitars. I picked this book up because it covered a wide range of information, from the history of guitars to recordinging your own music, and it does it with very clear descriptions and color photos. (use the look inside feature and you'll see what I mean) The guitar instruction part of the book is also very good. It doesn't overwhelm you with music theory and how to read music like most other books. It just shows you some basic cords and gets you strumming. Overall, a great book for those new to playing guitar."
4,"Not Saberhagen's best, but still worthy","I bought this book because I was blown away by his alternative telling of 'Frankenstein' (which appears, tragically, to be out of print.) It didn't live up to my first taste of Saberhagen, and so disappointed me.... but as a representative of the vampire and Holmesian genres, it's an original entry and a pleasant light read."
3,Sherlock Holmes and Dracula?,"Not only do Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and Rasputin manage to show up in the same novel, but Saberhagen unconvincingly proposes that Holmes and Dracula are cousins. The novel is not tightly constructed enough in some respects for my tastes, and in other places details I would like to have known more about are not explored. The story is told from the perspective of both Dr. Watson and Dracula and switches back and forth. Also, it is easy to guess what happened in the case of the drowned girl (the 'mystery' part of the novel). It shouldn't require the legendary sleuth Sherlock Holmes to figure it out."
4,Oglala Women,Got the book right on time. Highly satisfied with the customer service. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about unique Indian tribes.
4,Good meter small capacitance range,Bought this hoping to make use of the capacitance measurement but it doesn't clearly state that the range is only between 20nF to 20uF. Most electronics I was aiming to use it on range between 47uF-470uF.....
1,Would not recommend,"Multimeter lasted only about a week before totally flaking out. Readout showed a variety of random garbage every time I powered up. Replaced the battery to no avail. Shipped back and got a full refund, but will order a different unit in future."
2,MasTek MS8261,"Unit arrived safely but did not contain any information about country of origin, manufacturer, nor warranty details....just the instruction booklet. The info. wasn't there either. Have not tried the unit yet, but if I have a problem with it who does one contact?"
1,What I got was polyurethane,"My experience with this band seems to be different than other reviewers. The orginal band on my Seiko Aquamatic lasted only a few months. Great watch,lousy band. It was polyurethane and my experience is that polyurethane bands will crack and break. This was advertised as a rubber watch band. Real rubber will last for years though I haven't seen real rubber watch bands lately. I ordered this as a replacement and in a year or so it also cracked and broke. I replaced with with one I made myself from nylon webbing. The Seiko watch on the other hand is a great self winding watch. The one I have is my second one. The first lasted many years of diving and hard wear."
3,Seiko Rubber Watch Band Original 22mm for Divers,"Seiko Rubber Watch Band Original 22mm for Divers, this is not an original watchband, those were made in Japan, it is a Chinese watch band with a different style buckle. However good the quality, I would list it as a ""replica of original"" but not original."
3,Seiko Rubber Watch Band,"The watch band is exactly what I wanted, but the pins that were sent were not the right size. I sent them a note and I was told I would have to go to a local watch shop to get ones that fit. To me this is not good customer service."
1,Don't order this item,"Do not buy this product! This is not a seiko watch band. It is an extremely poor quality fake made in China. The original is rubber - this is more like a hard plastic. The original is designed to expand and contract with a wet suit. This product has some pathetic attempt to make it look like it expands. The part that really ticks me off is there is an oceanic stamp on the strap - not a Seiko Trademark, but has been synomomous with every authentic Seiko dive watch I have ever owned. I don't know if the seller is aware of what they are selling, and how much of a fraudulent copy it is."
2,Customer Service,I'm very disappointed that there was warranty for this item. I also sent an email to customer service about warranty but still no reply.
1,garbage,A CHEAP Chinese knockoff. Truly worth only $5. I paid $21.95 for total garbage. The only thing that I can say is Caveat Emptor.
2,Made In China - Not As Good As The Original,"This strap is made in China and it's longer than the original. I bought my Seiko diver's watch back in 1982 and it is a super watch that has never needed service although this is the second replacement strap. The quality is markedly worse than the previous replacement. The material is not rubber, the strap is longer and does not have the flexibility of the earlier version. Also the clasp is a cheap chrome plated material that does not match the body of the watch like the one on the original strap. How much more would this cost to make it in Japan?"
5,just like the original one that came off after 10yrs...,These are original just like what came off the seiko dive watch. Amazon had them cheaper and faster than any one else.I would recommend these to anyone else.... Great value and buy.
3,Not the real thing,"Ordered as a replacement for the orange monster rubber strap. Was disappointed to see this was not and original, but rather a similar type strap. There was no ""wave "" pattern and the material was close but not quite the same."
3,Seiko makes a GREAT watch but a poor Band.,"I have owned my Seiko diving watch for 13 years now and have had to change out the band three times now. This particular band is not rubber at all. It is some type of poly-urethane material and cracks over time. I know what you are saying,... 'rubber cracks, too'...but this band does not feel like rubber, nor is pliable or subtle as rubber either. I would only recommend this band because it keeps the watch in 'stock' condition and carries the Seiko logo. My jeweler charged me $10 to change out the band and he would have charged me $36 + tax for the band itself with free install,... so I guess I came out ahead by a few bones. The watch band pins are difficult to get out if you do not know what you are doing or own a special tool to do it. Anyway, I will probably get another one in a few years because I am a sucker. So, you are damned if you do, or damned if you don't."
1,Don't buy any seiko wrist band from this seller,This is 100% fake seiko wist band that I've recevied. It a China make cheap rubber band not even worth $5 doller so disappoint!!!
2,Did Seiko Change?,"My watch band is not like my original Seiko orange monster dive watch band. This one I ordered looks slightly cheaper. This is disappointing because I really wanted the exact same type of band to show up.So, did Seiko change the style, and I DID receive an accurate replacement? I am unsure.I do know my Seiko is legit because I bought it at one of the official Seiko stores in Leas Vegas (premium outlets.)Luckily, all I needed was the part of the band that holds the excess down."
3,"comfortable band,looks good","Good band at terrific price. Wish the material would be more durable as it splits after a few years,even with the best of care."
4,A decent watch band,"I have owned a Seiko Divers watch for 12 years. In that time I have had to replace the band four times now. I have always purchased a band which states it is identical to the original band and costs about twice what this one does. I read the other reviews about this band and many state the bands material is not quite the same as the original band. I do agree, this material is a little harder. It also has a smaller and different buckle on it. Other than that, it looks and is the same as the original. I would recommend and buy this one again because of the price. The one thing I did do was take the buckle off of my old one and replaced it with the new one. One last note, shipping was super fast."
4,Seiko replacement watch band,"I received my ""origional "" replacement watch bands in a timely manner as promised. They appear to be the watch bands I ordered but these watch bands are ""made in china"" type of ""origional"" seiko watch bands. Last I checked seiko watches were made in Japan. So only time will tell how well they hold up, and I don't even want to know what they are made of!!"
1,Not worth the box these shoes were sent in!,Installed these rear shoes on a 2002 Chrysler Voyager. The results were less than acceptable. The friction material refused to properly seat with the new drums. Installed new raybestos shoes and the problem was solved. Save youself some money in the long run and buy American brake components.
4,To Tasha Tee,"If you enjoyed the book and want to share your view that's great, but why tell who was killed off. You're giving to much info to someone who hasn't read it yet."
4,GREAT SEQUEL TO DRIVEN!!!!!!!!,"AFTER READING DRIVEN, I JUST HAD TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO NASIR AND ALL HIS WOMAN. ""AT THE COURTS MERCY"" WAS A GREAT FOLLOW UP. IN THE BOOK NASIR FIND OUT THAT HIS DRAMA WITH WOMAN IS JUST BEGINNING. HIS POOR CHOICE IN WOMAN KEEP HIS LIFE FILLED WITH DRAMA. AND THE DRAMA IS WHAT MAKE THIS BOOK SO GREAT. IT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED UNTIL THE END. I WOULD RECOMMENED THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO HAS READ ""DRIVEN"" OR IS JUST LOOKING FOR GOOD DRAMA FILLED BOOK!"
3,All over the place!!,"This sequel was just ok to me, Not that it was bad, but it was kind of all over the place, and the characters were just pathetic.I couldnt believe that one man could have such a huge impact on so many people even in death. I felt sorry for alot of the characters in this book and wasnt able to connect with neither one. The ending was ok, at least there was closure, so I hope this is where it all ends."
3,Kinda Cluttered,"The book was okay, but it seemed as though it was rushed through. The chapters were short and not very detailed and the plots were kinda crunched together."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS DRIVEN,"I WAS NOT FEELING THIS ONE,HAD TOO MUCH GOING ON PLEASE DON'T TELL ME THERE WILL BE A PART THREE."
4,Good Book,This book was good but I hated that the author killed Nasir and lil Marv. This was a very good book.
4,Good Low priced NLE Software,"Magix Video Deluxe is a great piece of software. It would be a five if the manual was worth the paper it's printed on. It does everything the novice to intermediate NLE editor needs, but you'll have to figure it all out yourself. I can't say too many times. THE MANUAL IS USELESS. Maybe that's how Magix can sell this product at such a low price point. Also you could grow a beard waiting for their support to answer the phone.In Summation:Buy this software, but be ready to devote some time to learning how it works."
2,Full-Featured Program with No Manual,"The features of this little program are mind-boggling but it doesn't do you much good if there isn't any guidance on how to use it. The manual that is provided by the manufacturer is the most sorry example of a ""How To"" I have ever seen. The application also offers video tutorials but they fall woefully short on delivering the level of information a reasonably intelligent beginner needs. I have no doubt that, with time, someone can figure out all the bells, gongs and whistles but unless you have experience in professional video editing , this program is NOT for the average individual. Too bad something this slick can't provide a better user manual!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for something more detailed on different laws that someone in HR should know. I felt this book was too broad and the way it was written was a little hard to read. If you are a business owner trying to get the basic ""dos and don'ts"" this may work, otherwise I would look elsewhere."
1,not for law students,"This is not a good study guide for an employment law class. Too basic and general. This may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring/firing etc, but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney."
4,Perfect for fans in the 10-12 age group.,"We gave this book to our 11-year-old Roberts fan for Christmas and she loved it. Cutting edge biography it isn't, but for younger fans of Ms. Roberts, it provides plenty to identify with and a few surprising facts."
3,"Nice, but too short",A decent biography for juveniles but far too short for anyone else (only 32 pages). Try Gary Fuller's biography about Julia (The Julia Roberts Story) if you're looking for something longer and better.
3,Heavier than he wanted,"Although the quality of the shirt is good, I would say that the material is a little too heavy to fit nicely tucked into pants so it is not as versatile as originally thought. If you want warmth, it is good, but too bulky for a good fit."
1,Can't seem to get an address right,"You might think Christmas is over for 2011 but not for my daughter. I sent 3 magazine subcriptions to her and none went to her and all to me. I filled out the forms correctly. When I found they were routing them wrong, I submitted change requests. At least 2 are still coming to the wrong address. Do your self a favor and don't gift magazines from Amazon."
3,"not advertized as sed as it is, but in good general condition","I don't remember the book being aderized as the first 60 pages being already filled in. Thankfully though, we did not really need to review that material. The book was in god condition and worth the cheap amount we paid for it. Seller shipped promptly also. Over all a good experience."
2,"Cute, but fell apart quickly!","My daughter wore this one day for a school play. It came VERY wrinkled, and all the edges immediately began to fray. One of the pompoms on the front disintegrated halfway through the day, and the elastic bottom came off one of the shoes. Luckily, it looked cute from a distance while she was on stage, but my hopes of her wearing it for Halloween are gone...it just wasn't made to hold up well."
3,Just Ok,"I bought this book for my almost 3 yr old daughter as her daddy leaves once again. I hoped the book would help us explain in a different way that daddy was leaving again. The book failed to meet my needs. Two strikes in relation to my family and this book - 1)it's about a boy with a baseball, and 2) it is really for an older kid. The author creates a nightly routine that has a baseball theme, but my daughter doesn't play baseball with daddy yet. I tried to change the words to a ""kiss"" with the ""moon"" but it didn't translate well. So, if you have a boy 5+ I would say that this is a great book. For a 3 yr old girl - not the book. I also bought ""Daddy goes on a trip"" which features a girl and is easier for a younger kids. This book seems to help(?). Good luck to all of you!"
1,This book costs too much,"The truth is, my friends, that I not read this book. Why then, you may ask, am I reviewing it? I am protesting to outrageous price for the book. Why should some paper cost this much. It is sinful how much this book costs. I would not pay more than 20 bucks for this book. Thank you, and I hope the proprietors of this book reconsider the price."
1,disgusted,"I am a foxhunter and I was disgusted with the nature of this book. It is anti-hunting garbage. I am truly disappointed. I was always a Nancy Drew fan growing up and thought this would be a fun read, but I couldn't be more unhappy. It is a campaign against hunting, and nothing more."
5,Great,Worked well on the watch My husbands watch band broke.. this one was perfect for the watch. fits well on him
5,Masterpiece!,"For someone who lived years in Iran and experienced the savage of iran mullahs regime, this book reveals the true face of the fundamentalism and idealogy of mulahs regime. But best of all, the reader can see the dark moments of iranian life under mullahs ruling iran. This is a book that I think everybody should read and think about. Understimating Islamic fundamentalism can change the world history in future and cause painful price for human race."
1,Highly Biased,"Mr. Mohandessian has essentially tried to re-write the bloody history of his group, the Marxist-Islamist Iranian ""Mujahedin"" (aka MEK, MKO, NCR etc.) which has been classified as a terrorist group by the US State Department for years, and is almost universally detested by Iranians for its collaboration with Saddam during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war."
2,waste of money,"This was a very boring movie. It was a typical horror comedy except for one thing, the acting was below a B movie. The kill scenes were not good either. I guess the budget wouldn't allow fake blood. Save your money!"
1,laughable,"This movie wasn't even what I would call a B-horror movie. The acting was terrible and the script predictable, this is a miss in my opinion."
1,WTH,"I have no clue what this movie was about. It had no beginning, no middle, and the only end it had was when I cut this crap off. This was absolutely garbage. Do not waste your money or time."
1,not an ella tribute cd,"this is a short cd of odetta in concert doing her usual set....if you have her earlier work,this is not needed. I expected a cd of new work related to ella ...it isn't. the concert just happened to take place near when ella died...hence the dedication. This is not a collection of songs made famous by ella and performed by odetta as I thought...very disappointed."
1,Passing the buck,"The avowed purpose of this book is to blame white people for what black people do. If you were to read books about the way that black people acted in Africa before they became slaves, you would find the same violence that is found today in the black slums. They didn't ""become"" violent as a result of being moved from Africa to South Carolina, they were violent from the beginning. Have none of you people ever heard of tribal warfare?"
4,Math made marvelous!,The kids in our elementary school love this book. Teachers love the reproducable pages. Parents wanted to know how to get it for Christmas. I think a few of them wanted it for themselves or a Math Challenged Spouse! If you have a Scholastic Book fair be sure to request that they stock this title! Scouts have used it for their math badge projects. Get it- get two because you'll want a spare to pass along.
5,A True Tribute to Mexico,"Brazil's little Nelson Ned is short in stature but a giant in his voice and his poetic art. This album he did as a Tribute to Mexico, with him singing beautiful versions of some of Mexico's most beautiful songs such as La Barca and Sabor A Mi as well as Noche de Ronda. He sings Juan Gabriel's Se Me Olvido Otra Vez and El Dia Que Me Acaricies Llorare as well as La Diferencia beautifully on this album, with my favorate song on the album being his version of El Dia Que Me Acaricies Llorare. On La Barca it is to mention that he adds at the end a bit of his own Poetry in a beautiful setting.I strongly recomend this beautiful Tribute to Mexico."
3,High Risk,"Good Action for an older movie. Funny scenes, Anthony Quinn is great as a mexican bandit. It's about a group of ordinary guys who venture to mexico to steal drug money from a drug lord. Not believable but fun to watch."
2,"WELL, AFTER ALL, IT IS WATCHABLE AT TIMES","FOUR UNEMPLOYED GUYS PARACHUTE INTO SOUTH AMERICA WITH THE PLAN TO ROB A DRUG LORD. NOT ALWAYS AS GOOD AS I WOULD HOPE IT TO BE, BUT AT LEAST IT DID HAVE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS. OVER THE YEARS, THIS FILM HAS BECOME QUITE FORGOTTEN. NOW THAT IT'S ON DVD, YOU CAN FIND THIS MOVIE FOR AS CHEAP AS $1.00, WHICH IS WHAT I BOUGHT THIS DVD FOR. IF YOU LIKE ACTION FILMS WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR, THEN WATCH THIS."
2,Unintentional slapstick junk with a laughably bad script,"Pretty bad. The main problem is the harebrained script that can't decide if it's a farce or a caper flick, or both, or neither. Borgnine is amusing as usual in a bit part, Quinn and Coburn are wasted in their roles, and the weak tv-grade actors like Brolin and Davison match the script for ineptness; the whole thing looks like a weak tv movie from the late 70s.The plot has endless holes, the direction is spotty, and this just feels like the sort of thing you'd watch on late night tv for five minutes and then give up on. But, cinematic masochist that I can sometimes be, I stuck it out to the end and was rewarded with one of the lamest and least plausible denouements imaginable. Or rather unimaginable. Ridiculous; they should have just made this a satire and ran. But, they played it for real instead of laughs, and it all ends up looking like an accidental farce instead of the real thing."
2,OK movie but crummy DVD,"I liked the movie but this has got to be the worst DVD transfer I have seen, and that's saying something. I have the 2002 BCI Eclipse release, UPC 8736444689. It looks like somebody had a worn out VHS tape version they decided to copy to DVD. It' s a blurry full screen presentation. The colors are all washed out and there are numerous glitches in the video. The sound is mono, and limited in bandwidth. Not a pretty sight (or sound)."
1,bad DVD,"I waited the longest of all the movies I orderd for this one. I was looking forward to sitting down with popcorn and really enjoying a movie I hadn't seen for a long time. When I put it in my player I got a blank screen. Must have a bad player, right? no I put it in another player same blamk screen. Well I'm still waiting to see Hi Risk."
3,Could be better,"They are okay, not at all like the picture for Cobalt. No coverage of where you rest your left foot on the driver side."
2,Odd Flavor,"I bought the fruit flavor hoping my son (who's not crazy about brushing his teeth) would like it. However, the flavor, while definitely fruity, was just weird. It was definitely unlike any fruit flavored gum I've ever had before. At some point I'd be willing to try the mint or cinnamon--I'd imagine those flavors are easier to get right."
3,another Bob Hoskins classic,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.In this movie, Bob Hoskins plays the role of George, a man recently released from prison who takes a job driving a prostitute to her customers. George has been shunned by former colleagues and his ex wife and struggles to make a living.The film has good acting and is very well photographed. Again with having first seen Bob hoskins in the film, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and having seen that film an uncountable number of times before seeung him in other films, it is hard to see Hoskins in any other role.The film recieved an R rating in the US for violence, profanity, and brief female nudity. This DVD has been approved by director Neil Jordan and has 2 special features. There is a theatrical trailer and audio commentary by director Niel Jordan and actor Bob Hoskins which was originally recorder for the laserdisc edition in 1996"
2,"A good book to start with pfc, but not version 7.0","In a version 7.0 of PFC, PowerBuilder created a lot of new function and events and this book did not explore that characteristics."
1,"incorrect , uses obsolete func tions","Very poor. This uses obsolete functions and syntax, some obsoleted in PowerBuilder 6, many more obsoleted in PB 7. You're worse off learning it wrong. The problem is that the obsolete syntax is still supported in PB 7 , so it seems to work, but you will be using the incorrect methods and eventually when you upgrade the code may fail to work. Better off just using the Help system. There are other (numerous) errors."
5,Excellent Step-by-Step approach to learning PFC,This book provides an excellent step-by-step approach to learning the PFC. The material gets right down to applying the services in a practical hands-on manner. This is the best book for learning PFC because it provides labs exercises for applying the techniques.
3,A Simple way to programming in Power Builder,The Power Builder's PFC is good tool for Objet Oriented programmig
1,Forced to use this for a senior paper.,"It's entertaining to read all the positive reviews from teachers. From a students perspective this book is absolutely awful, full of fluff. You have to slog through anecdote after anecdote to get to any useful information. This book could easily be condensed to twenty or so pages making it of actual value for someone who wants to write a paper rather than choke down Ballingers cutesy writing in search of mediocre (and usually very basic) advice.Princeton Writing Center's website, along with every other colleges' I am sure, offers the same information without the fluff and without the price tag.I wish the University of Minnesota's return policy wasn't a joke so I could get my money back."
1,A huge waste of time,"At first when I read this book I actually liked the way it flowed. It isn't one of those drawn out, boring types. However, as I continued to read I realized that this book should not be used by a college level student, but rather a middle school level student. This book deals far too much with understanding what you have learned; a big time waster. It even uses exercises like making up a dialogue with someone else to answer questions about your topic (this particular exercise is supposed to take an hour). For me this is a ridiculous extreme that should only be used by those who either have way too much time on their hands or have a hard time understanding how to think for themselves. Personally, I believe I am worse off from having read this book."
2,Curious Researcher - Save Your Money,"This was a required text for English 103. As a student it was pure fluff. I agree with others who say this belongs in the middle school or high school curriculum. The lowest point of the book was the ""Dialogues with Dave"" section. I was supposed to have a written conversation about my research paper with basically an imaginary friend. I did the exercises for my grade, but they didn't help at all. I received a high grade in the class, no thanks to this textbook. Please, if you are an instructor of a course past high school do not require this book for your students. There must be better options on the market."
4,Great Product,"I had to write a review because I use it to play back music. It works and I have no complaints. My daughter has emailed a musical slide show to my sister in Utah and she thinks it's just great. We loaded in some family pictures from our recent get together and added the theme music from some CDs we had and emailed it over...so she gets to watch the family slide show we compiled. It's really wonderful. I'm still learning a little at a time on how to use all the features, but I'm getting there. It's definitely fun and interesting."
2,Terrible. Sleep MD is better.,"The Simply Sleep isn't what it advertised itself to be. It claimed to be nothing but a sleep aid, but the active drug is nothing but an allergy medication that has a side effect of drowsiness. Also, it didn't even give me a true drowsiness. Yes, it made me tired, but when I tried to go to sleep, my whole body tingled unnaturally, which made me constantly want to stretch and toss and turn to find a position comfortable enough to sleep in. I went to sleep in an hour, but the level of comfort was almost not worth taking it to begin with. I woke up earlier than usual as well, which can be a plus since I have trouble waking up, but throughout the day I was more tired than usual."
4,iTunes too blind to see,"I bought this CD when it first came out. I still love the music. But when I recently wanted to enter the CD in my iTunes collection, so that I could listen to it on my iPod, my iMac refused to read the CD. Therefore I went looking on the internet to see if I could still find this CD. That was not easy but through Amazon I managed to order one in the US (I live in Europe). After one week I received the CD. All was ok except that I had the same problem. This new CD also could not be loaded into iTunes because of an error.Maybe this CD is not fit to be read by a computer?"
1,Buy the single...,"This cd gets one star; one star for the first track, and that's it. If you like Kym Sims ""Too blind to see it"", buy the single instead. It seems like she really was a one hit wonder. Then again, that one hit was and still is GREAT, so get the single."
3,Great resource,"This book is the first I've bought to help me revive my '82 silverwing. It's the best book I've found so far, with chapters detailing most service repair information. I have had to go hunting for some of the more specialized info on the Internet still tho..."
4,A dark and brooding story,"Like Edinburgh itself. John Rebus is very much a child of Edinburgh and the mystic highlands. This is the first book in the John Rebus series, and it's a good one. We get a good introduction to John Rebus, and the dark side of his character. I have seen some of these done on television, and I was really looking forward to beginning this series. It did not disappoint. It is easy to see why Rankin won the Gold Dagger and the Edgar prizes with this book. There is a lot of power in his writing, and he builds a good plot too. I am looking forward to reading more of John Rebus, and I will be prepared for more dark and brooding prose."
5,The start of a long literary relationship,"Very, very good. I will be reading much more of this author. As the father of 13 and 9 year girls I found the modus operandi of the killer a bit squicksome, but got past that when I realized he wasn't going to be that graphic.Very, very good, and I have been led to believe that this is the less focused of the Rebus books... Good times ahead!"
4,Nice intro to Rebus and the series,This detective/mystery novel is a great intro to the detective Rebus series. This books moves along quickly and Rankin develops interesting characters and a sense of urgency along the way. I'm glad I heard about Rankin and this Rebus series.
4,A Good First Effort,"I was excited to discover a new British mystery author. It seems that Americans just don't do this particular genre very well and I usually just put a book down if I see that an author is from America or writing about America. Brits do this kind of stuff better.Anyway, I wasn't disappointed in this first effort. Some people find this book dark and dreary, but I was reading 'Trainspotting' at the same time I was reading this one and I thought the Edinburgh theme was great. British mysteries are dark, Americans mysteries are too sappy and optimistic. The darkness gives this book depth and feeling. I can't wait to read more Ian Rankin!"
2,Disappointingly predictable,"I was told to read this book by a man who knew I was visiting Edinburgh. He said it was a great series, and would be a good idea to read it as it ""takes you on a tour of Edinburgh."" I feel like I went to bar after bar, if anywhere at all. With a lush, and a smoking fiend who's greatest accomplishment is the amount of self-loathing he holds. As for the mystery. ...I saw the killer shortly after his character was introduced. It was like trudging though sludge to arrive at the end if he book. Maybe all the hype added to my disappointment, but if you're looking for a good mystery I suggest you continue on."
2,Too much grit & grime,The author is so busy trying to portray the grit & grime of the seamy underside of Edinburgh that the story line gets lost. I lost interest in poor inspector Rebus about half way through.
4,Thrilled to find Rankin,"This was perhaps not a great book, but it was well written, interesting and from what I hear, the weakest in the series. It was written eons ago when Rankin was but a pup and there are what 16...17 more? I am thrilled. I think I have found a new author!"
4,A great start on a great series,"This is a great debut, written by, at the time, a very young Ian Rankin. The book lays the ground for a brilliant crime novelist career. Bonus: Preface for the book, and for the series, written by the author himself."
3,First in a Series of John Rebus,It started slow but finished fast. I am on to the second book now. I like to watch a character develop and I am told Rebus is a classic.
3,A striking blow to librarians everywhere!*,"I love Rankin's writing style and vivid depictions of Edinburgh. Of course, as a huge fan of Irvine Welsh, I am not unfamiliar with the seamier side of this city.Unfortunately, the plot itself was relatively predictable. Maybe because I had just finished Iain Banks' Complicity (masterful and much recommended), also set in Edinburgh and featuring characters who had participated in a brutal military training regimen, I found Rankin's mystery uninspired...*...That is, except for the bit I mention in my title line. I am a library school student, and I was quite taken aback by this part. It made me love the book more!I will definitely read more John Rebus mysteries."
3,Two and a half stars rounded up to three,"I had read great things about this author and was looking forward to reading this book, which I believe is his first. And, maybe his work gets better, but I won't be finding out. This book just seemed very mediocre overall to me. It's short, which I'm happy about, so I can move on to read something else. The plot has a lot of not believable aspects and the writing did not appeal enough to me to help draw me into the scenes. I don't know that a lot more needs to be covered about it. There are a lot of great crime writers to choose from, so it doesn't hurt to check out a new one now and then. This one just didn't appeal to my taste. Obviously, plenty of others like him, so I'm probably in the minority opinion. Two and a half stars rounded up to three. And, moving on."
3,"Good, But Not Very","There's a scene in this book where Detective John Rebus' boss says that Rebus is ""not a very good policeman, just a good one."" Well, this book is not a very good book, just a good one. And barely that. Rebus is not a very well-developed character, in my estimation. He's not very credible and, as his boss says, he's barely a good cop. The plot of this novel is uneven and unexceptional. About half way through the book you know where it's going and the ending is unexciting and pedestrian. This is my second try at Rankin. I stopped reading the first one half way through, and I wished I hadn't wasted my time on this one. Adieu, Detective Rebus."
2,Weak Series Debut,"Ian Rankin's debut John Rebus procedural has several similarities to John Harvey's Charlie Resnick series, weary, flawed, divorced, mid-level policeman hero, nasty plot (serial killer of little girls), set in a dark British city (Edinburgh). However, Rankin's book doesn't measure up in characterization, plausibility, or even plot to any of Harvey's books. Therefore, I will return my attention to finishing the Harvey books before giving Rankin a second chance."
2,Don't bother,"This book contains the two things that I hate to find in a mystery book -- a contrived plot which depends on unbelievable coincidences, and a main character with hang-ups coming out his wazoo. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is that it's well-written."
4,Enjoy a little fantasy in these 3 stories,Reprints or not...these are fictional accounts of LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT with strangers. And they are wonderful...strange for the real world. But great stories.
1,Don't Bother,"I'm a new fan of Linda Howard, and I love some of the other books she has wrote(like Heart of Fire) but don't bother with this one. The stories has no depth, too many words and the stories are so far fetched! These stories are about two people meeting, having sex, falling in love and deciding to spend the rest of they're lives together, ALL IN ONE DAY!! Very unrealistic, and it simply didn't sit well with me. In the third story, the women, pulls a half frozen, unconscious man in from the cold, and takes off her cloths to warm him up. She falls asleep on top on top of him, and then wakes up with him having sex with her. In my book this is rape, but she enjoys it and keeps going. She doesn't even know his name!! Then continues to sleep with him! Urgh! Don't bother with this book. Very disappointed."
1,Already read these,"I read 2 out of three of these books already, so I was disappointed. I thought it was a new book but its just three of her not so good books in one."
3,Not Great,"I generally like Linda Howard's style of writing. That style is certainly evident here but the stories don't have much development which is not like some of her past writing. Characters and locale are described adequately but the characters just jump together almost instantly. There's not much story in these short stories. Missing is the ""thrill of the chase"" as another reviewer put it."
3,If you have nothing to do...,"While I love LH I am usually skeptical of short stories and this book basically proved me right. The first two stories were a total let down, not bad and even worth it if you had an hour to kill and didnt want to become involved in a full out novel but the stories were empty and rushed and there was zero character connection. However the last one, white out, was actually pretty good. It would have made a decent full novel and I did really enjoy that one. This book has a time and a place as long as no one has big expectations for it."
4,Three terrific novellas,"I was glad that these stories were available through reprints; else I would have had to buy 3 books separately (if I could find them). I have always enjoyed Linda Howard's books and I don't mind reading older books that are being reprinted. This seems to be the trend in publishing world today. These stories; Lake of Dreams White Out and Blue Moon are what I consider some her best stories. The first story, Lake of Dreams, was a bit different and White Out was my favorite of the three. Overall, I enjoyed all of the stories."
3,Mediocre.....,These stories have appeared elsewhere but I had never seen them before so I was happy to read them. Linda should stick to full length novels as opposed to short stories. She is best at developing characters in novels rather than stories.These were ok...not great. The best story was the one about the couple who is repeatedly reincarnated and finally end up together. Very poignant and touching. I have re-read it about 5 times so far.
1,What a rip!,"It is just 3 reprints, The ""Lake of Dreams"", ""Blue Moon"" and oh I can't remember the last one. I e-mailed Simon books and was sent an e-mail that said this was a NEW book with NEW stories. LIE ... I'm not saying the stories are not good they are. I have just already read them. When are publishers going to wise up and aknowledge that the buying public DO know the difference between reprint and new print.!@!"
3,Just another reprint,"Nothing to get excited about.... It is just another reprint...""Strangers In The Night"" includes ""Lake of Dreams,"" ""Blue Moon"" and ""White Out."""
2,Mushy but no substance,"These stories had no substance. These couples got together very quickly and there wasn't any thrill of the chase. I am a huge fan of Linda Howard, have loved all of her books (well... except Sarah's Child because she was such a pushover) but now Strangers is on that no good list. I read the book because of the great reviews but I should have believed the reader from California, written 11/22/02."
3,Strangers in the Night,I love this book. I travel a lot and this book was perfect for a good read that gave me a fast thrill. It was great and I enjoyed.
2,Case too big for Zune 80 Gig,This seems to be a good quality protector for an electronic device however it is maybe a 1/4 inch to big for the Zune 80G device. I just kind of moves around inside of it.
4,A beautiful meditation on a mother's sacrifice,"I don't how how Richard Furey did it, but he did. He has effectively climbed into a mother's heart with real understanding.This booklet allows you to experience Christ's Passion, death and Resurrection through the eyes of His Mother, Mary. This meditation is appropriate especially during Lent, but will bring you closer to Jesus at any time of year. The language is simple yet profound in its wisdom and presence. The faithful are taken to a place of real appreciation for Jesus's love and sacrifice--the place where real repentance reigns.Get this booklet, definitely. Keep in mind, however, that there is no way to prepare yourself for how it will forge new depths in the hearts of the faithful.You will have a new understanding of the sentiment, ""To Jesus through Mary.""God bless!"
1,Angel,"I loved all other books Satrapi wrote, but this one . . I did not get it.It was not like other books of hers, which I could not put down, I had hard time to keep reading it.WELL as I said, maybe I did not get this!"
4,Nostalgic,As an Iranian I enjoyed this story a great deal. I still believe Satrapi's best work is Persepolis (the first one). Overall I enjoy reading all her work.
3,OVERALL SCORE: (B-/C+),"This is a fair to good collections of short stories that are somewhat interesting.Why buy this book, well if you want to read the books and series that follow the characters that are started here, that would be the reason.Ed Greenwood `The Patriarch' -- slow and dull (C-)Richard Lee Byers `The Matriarch' -- strange (C-)Clayton Emery `The heir'-- unlikable fop (C+)Voronica Whitney-Robinson `The Daughter'-- spoiled, very spoiled(C)Dave Gross `The Youngest Son'-- interesting werewolf (B)Paul Kemp `The Butler' -- superb story of a likable assassin!!! (A+)Lisa Smedman `The Maid' -- really good story of a cleric to be? (A-)OVERALL SCORE: (B-/C+)READABILITY: (?), PLOT: (B-), CHARATERS: (B-), DIALOGUE: (B-), SETTING: (B+), ACTION/COMBAT: (A-), MONSTERS/ANTAGONISTS: (C+), ROMANCE: (B), SEX: (n/a), AGE LEVEL: (PG)"
5,Almost perfect,"I've been a Realms fan for about ten years. Some books are hits, some are misses, and some have been awful. The Halls of Stormweather is great. Granted, a couple things were predictable, and there was one glaring discrepancy in character relationships (reread the Patriarch and Matriarch stories and see if you can find it). The authors did an excellent job provoking interest in the main figures of each story--I'd even get the books about the characters I didn't like just because I want to know what happens to them. Shamur, Tazi, Cale, and the maid whose name I can't recall are my favorite characters. They've got the most depth. Overall it's a fun read and great if you've only got a few minutes at a time to spend on a book."
5,A Must-read for every family!,"I don't know what made me remember this book tonight. I'm thirty-one years old. I was approximately five to seven years old when Mr. Tompkins visited us at the Ritzville school library. He read ""The Catalog"" to y class. I bought a copy of the book and Mr. Tompkins placed his name in the inside cover next to a quick sketch of a mountain and a bear. I had forgotten the book till tonight, when a came to the sad realization that I do not possess the book anymore and I have no idea where or when I lost it. I love the simple line drawings and the fun and simple story of cooperation and friendship and sharing. What an exciting book for a child to learn those traits from!"
1,Simplistic and simply wrong,"Herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the Nazification of both Germanies: did they side with Israel in the Middle East version of the Cold War or did they not? The trial against Paul Merker in the East, which had as its background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the Holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the West and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in Western academia."
1,"Not much headroom. Feedback and 'talking in tunnel"" sounds",This was the better mic recommended for the AT3000 wireless system. The MUCH cheaper ones actually worked just as good or better. Save your money.
3,Umm... O-kay. But....,"The first track, Love, is the track that got substantial play on all of the ""smooth jazz"" radio stations. This track is sublime. The remainder of the album is exactly as the name implies...a series of squeaks, chirps, groans, and burps; arguably artsy, in its own eclectic way. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love this album. But if you have heard the first track on the radio, don't buy the album on the strength of that song, as it is not at all representative of the remainder of the album, and you will be disappointed."
5,Who's Really Afraid,"Sort of a mini-best-of, featuring AoN's one album for the ZTT label (WHO'S AFRAID OF) and other choice cuts from 12"" singles and their mini-LP INTO BATTLE. The extra tracks make for a great listen. Three versions of Moments of Love is one too many - I'd ditch the first or second, 'cause ""Three Fingers"" is excellent. Even my mom likes this album, so I'll recommend it to pretty much anyone."
3,A lot of noise,"Well I wasted my money again. I was taken by this group's ""Moments in Love"" and hoped the other cuts would be similar, NADDA!! Make positive it is what you are looking for before you buy, good advise in all purchases really."
1,The Fat Free Living Super Cookbook,"Over several months I tried many of the recipes in this cookbook. I could not honestly rate any of them even ""fair."""
5,all time favourite,"If I had to live on a deserted island, this is definately one of the albums I will take with me. Track # 2 kicks a-s-s !!"
4,For Budding Performers..,"This was the CD we played the most while driving with my 60year old mother and 3 year old daughter this summer. The French andGerman countryside rang with the lovely voices on ""Castles in a Cloud"", ""Happiness"" and the very American ""Gary, Indiana"". My daughter performs the ""Annie"" medley for us every chance she gets and gives special emphasis when singing ""I Won't Grow Up"". I look forward to purchasing and listening to the other Broadway Kids offerings. On a rainy afternoon, it's fun use this music to act out our own Broadway show. My mother especially loved the ""Oliver"" medley and the clarity and sweetness of the children's voices! I highly recommend it for the entertainer in your child. TS"
3,My kids love it!,"My kids love listening to this in the car. At least I get to sing along to songs that I like, too."
3,Sailor Moon : Love Ballad,"I think that this CD is good but the only thing I don't like is I can't read/understand Japanese. This CD has some lovely songs, there is one or two that I love. The music is very heart warming and touches the soul. This is a good item for a real hard-core Sailor Moon Fan."
1,No match for Solti & Co from Salzburg,"It's no match either for Sawallisch's own legendary audio recording for EMI. The Solti on video from Salzburg and the Sawallisch from Munich on compact disc are the ones to beat. Both conductors were fortunate to have superior (and still unbeatable) casts (the best Kaiserin since Rysanek [Studer], Marton, et al) at the time their interpretations were captured for posterity. This Sawallisch video from Japan simply falls short vocally and dramatically."
3,Too small for a laptop...,"This was much too small for any of my laptops, and the 'ridges' on the edges will scratch the heck out of anything that is larger than it's small footprint. Based on the previous review I bought this to put my laptop on the tripod, and now regret it... Will be returning."
1,THIS PROGRAM IS FOR RETARDS,please do not support this one-among-hundreds of televisa's contribution to mexican stupidity by buying or seeing this vulgar arsenio hall/chris rock's - imitator show.
5,elegant groovy dance/lounge music,Bummer that you can only listen to the first couple of songs cause it's the last once that the best. It's classy house that jazzy at places and sambaish in other.
4,It must be a French thing...,"The mixing is tight and most of the tracks keep a feel of rolling deep. This is a late night groove that kicks off house touched with jazz. Eventually the groove turns to those housey breaks under jazz for a track or so. My only problems were that no matter how I tried, I couldn't kick enough bass under the tracks. Also I question a few of the track selections. I realize the 'Sometimes' track is his mix, but better mixes are out. The Bjork rant boarders on annoying at certian hours and mindframes. In American terms, this tape could be mistaken for San Fransico house. However, I suspect Monsieur Dimitri hasn't really spent quality time in Chicago. That said, this is the best house mix by a non-American I've heard in 7 years of house devotion."
1,"Not worth the read, waste of a good story","I do not have the time to write a full review and believe that my headline comment expresses my view of the book under review,"
3,I only really like the Desiderata,I wanted this CD very much and I LOVE The Desiderata but the other selections are just OK. So I play the Desiderata and skip the others.
3,"you must also hear the satiracle version ""Deteriorata""...","also available in mp3 form on amazon ,such a classic, the 2 should almost be a package .this more a comment than a review ,should there be an x tra box ?the satire vers. is from 1972 nat. lampoon albumthat it also a little dated but a fun flashback and very heartfelt."
2,Desirata,"thought it would be better than it was, but i had not heard it before. it is sitting on a shelf."
4,i really like the cosmic energizer book the name alone is great,"i got this book at a bookstore on market street in San Francisco around ninety eighty. i really like picking it up every now and then and sometimes just relaxing and understanding there are great things in this universe. i recommend it if you can get it for a low cost, my cover has a price tag of 3.95. well worth it i must say.regards, the cosmic energizer, miracle power of the universe brings it all together for me....."
2,Disappointing,"As a therapist and a 'seeker', this book was disappointing. One is better off reading something like the Dali Lama's ""Guide to Happiness"" and any book, such as David Burn's on Feeling Good which describes more clearly cognitive behavioral techniques. At times, this book is 'over the top' New Age, but its not new- much of what he says is old and has also been said by the Budhists and Kabbalists."
4,"Action-oriented book, see yourself as source of love","Don't let this book fool you ... it's not just for romantic couples but everyone in a relationship to their family, friends, and colleagues. Grayson has lots of action-oriented excercises to help readers get the personal experience of the techniques he advocates. Spiritually-based psychotherapy with some practical examples. Mindful Loving is for those who believe that love must come from within before it can be extended without."
5,Love this book,"Purchased this book a few months ago, but when I first read it, it changed my live. Every now and then I sit down with the book and read certain paragraph and the content does not disappoint.The meditation exercises are simple, but give them a trial. They will leave you feeling refreshed and alert.If you're feeling lost, restless or are on a spiritual path or have a need to understand how you can have BETTER relationships in your life - whether FAMILY, FRIENDLY or LOVE relationships (even how you relate to YOURSELF) READ THIS BOOK!!!!I HIGHLY recommend it."
4,This is very cool,"I'm a big Lemony fan and i couldn't find this calendar anywhere! So, I just ordered it here. I saw the cover, and it's so beautiful. I thought for sure the awesome Mr. Helquist was gonna have more of these awesome new drawings inside. But no, the insinde is kinda bland, but the things that each day says ae halarious and are sure to make you laugh. Just read one veryday. It's makes it fun erie if you haven't read it, so just read them day by day. It'll cheer you up! So I sujest this to any Lemony fan. Every fan needs one! And hurry! They're hard to find!"
5,A melodic Treat,This song is one of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard. The smooth sounds of Joe and Case seem to personify what R&B music should be. I could listen to this song forever and ever. It is sooo mellow. I wish I could hear more songs like this one.
5,Record Changer Restoration,"I used these in a restoration of a Voice of Music 400 series record changer on a Stewart-Warner model A92CR6 console radio made in 1947. It worked great as an idler wheel tire replacement, though I did have to wrap some electrical tape around the wheel rim to make its diameter a bit bigger so the o-ring would fit snugly."
1,Tonight's the Night of the crystal gavel,"Looking at the crystal gavel reminds me of something Shakey taught mewhich is, everything's cheaper than it looks. This philosophy was bornduring his Ditch Trilogy period. Essentially, he attached his early success andfame to one-sided explorations. For example, one can easily hear Heart of Goldand imagine that John Denver might have written such a lightweight song.It might be interesting to perform an experiment in which a subject is exposedto a medium and then asked to select from a group of expensive objects or cheapobjects. Perhaps Shakey's reaction to his success was to challenge this conceptby daring an audience to follow him in to The Ditch, as he called it. I interpret thesongs from these albums as bare and fragile emotional train wrecks, but simultaneouslyuseful and beautiful. I suspect what draws people to the crystal gavel is the samething that draws me to The Ditch."
1,Be careful!,"I thought this gavel would be a useful addition to my burgeoning low-budget dental practice. However, the night after it arrived I woke up to find the gavel trying to have sex with me. I explained to it that I wasn't interested in that type of relationship, and it was really sullen about the whole thing. Now it just sits on the couch watching ""Home Improvement"" with the sound turned down and listening to that one Dramarama song. It's incredibly tiresome. Thanks a lot, Godinger."
4,A peerless work of nature,"What the description on this item fails to mention is the absolute rarity of the item. There are only 327 Godinger Crystal Gavels known to man. They are formed in the Merchandizoid gland of the male Dinger Toad of Central Ecuador. (latin name Cheapcrappicus Outragus) The toad, weighing anywhere from eleven to fifteen pounds at maturity, climbs to the highest branches of the local flora during mating season. Once the motley beast reaches an appropriate height, it unleashes one long, loud, and completely unpleasant mating belch. The raw Merchandizoid stone is then ejected upon the unsuspecting heads of potential prey, and housewives. It is estimated that only one in every hundred thousand is of sufficient size and heft to be carved into an authoritative trinket. The carving and polishing is performed by only the most slothful and greedy tourist-scalping natives of the surrounding tribes. But oh, what a treasure."
3,No hits,"This product did not have any of the hits on it like I was expecting, and besides that it really effed up three of my CD players and maybe a whole hard drive. I don't think it's in a format that works in this country. Then later when it finally did sing to me, it didn't even sound like country and western music. I tried to use it to adjust my glasses, but it broke the crap right out of them. njo9w 'ilm u7yssssssssuun g iu9t to0 ty7po thuise sen t5enmces. There's a giant hole in my floor and it fits in there pretty good. I've found that it really isn't good for anything, but I'm happier knowing it's nearby and it does expand me. I'm going now to look for something about how to knit because it makes me want to knit something for it. Maybe if I knew already how to knit, or if it would have taught me how to knit I could have given 4 stars, but instead 3."
3,I guess if you're into crystal...,"I have two gavels that kick this gavel's end: one made of Turkish Delight, and one made of my own fingernail clippings bound together with clumps of hair. As you might imagine, they provide some sonic variety (when banging). It's also fun to cover your husband or those you might be sentencing with confectioner's sugar, like they've got a dandruff problem, or it's raining cocaine. You can also say things like ""You've been nailed!"" or ""What a hair-brained prank!"" and then sentence the offender to household chores, like cleaning toothpaste blobs off of the sink or pulling burrs off of the cat, chores that are really just gavels-in-the-making.If you're into crystal, though, this one's not bad."
1,Incorrect Ad Wording Led Wee Winston to Issue Platelets,"This Godinger Crystal Gavel has very little to do with Betty Grable, Gavin Rossdale, Gavin DeGraw or Galavantin' Gal-Grabber Gladys. Udder disappointment as it lacks the required homogeneity to function as cattle-prod. It appears rather fetching atop hubby-honed light-box / does not sit well with Folger's Flavor Crystals. I seek no remuneratin', just some elucidatin' as to the intended use / Zanzkreet tableaux instructional cable did not inform. 'Til info flows, Chris-Tall gave God-injured 'ell. Please to keep up the sub-par knock-around Cristal op. Best of fun to your tenni-runners."
4,Blind Melon Rocks,"This is a great DVD. They play their favorite song ""No Rain"". I just wish Shannon Hoon (lead singer) didn't get his hair cut so short."
1,Oh my God...,"I don't know what the other reviewers have been watching.Luckily, I searched youtube for some excerpts from this concert before buying it, and it is so painful to watch.Shannon Hoon would be dead shortly after this concert, and the reason is quite obvious when looking at this footage. Shannon looks so stoned he can barely stand. His voice sounds accordingly...Poor guy, I felt so sorry for him.I purchased the ""Letters from a porcupine"" dvd, instead."
1,Diabolical,"What a terrible DVD. I'm no pessimist, this was recorded horribly. Either Shannon Hoon's voice is awful or the recording was. I suspect it was the latter. I will admit, I'm not a hardcore Blind Melon fan, but I'd downloaded some of their songs like mouth full of cavities et al..and was very impressed. I read the previous reviews and took the gamble of buying the DVD. What a mistake. I also bought Alice in Chains Unplugged which is excellent. If you want to see a grown man wearing makeup and flaling his hands like an octopus while shreeking to the crowd buy this. Otherwise save your money."
5,Great buy for Blind Melon Fans,This dvd is a great buy if you are a blind melon fan. No one gets into music as much as Shannon Hoon and this item has immortalized one of Shannon's last performances for all to enjoy. R.I.P Shannon and thanks for the music you have left for us.
3,"Not bad, but...","I couldn't make up my mind if it had no plot or too many plots. As a series of character studies or a glimpse into New York City history, it was a great book. I could've done without Jung and Freud visit America, and still am not sure what they added to the story, but I really got caught up in Esther's story. I have seen the ""Coney Island"" program by Ric Burns that was mentioned in the sources section, and this kept bringing me back to memories of that show."
1,Not very good,"Although the author has obviously spent a good amount of time doing his research, the time might have been better spent developing a coherent plot or creating charaters of any substance. With all of the excellent books available, you might want to give this one a pass."
5,"Enchanting and earthy,a 20th.century rival to Dickens.","This book grabs you immediately and pulls you into the incredible world of New York at the turn of the century. Gritty, down to earth, and sometimes shocking, you can almost smell the cabbage cooking in the tenaments. Yet, at the same time, we never lose sight of the dreams and hopes of the immigrants in the midst of all the squalor. Very well researched and written, it paints a vivid picture of New York seldom seen in books."
2,"Nice book, but not worth your time","Hey all, I'm not one to usually write a bad review, but the ending of this book forced me to. I'm not going to give it away, however, it was....Lacking. After all the investment that this book required, I was hoping for more. Nice picture, but I prefer Caleb Carr's books which are of a similar subject matter. Todd"
2,Violent and self indulgent,Dreamland is filled with bizarre and violent charectors none of whom I could relate to. The fact that one of the main charectors worked at the Triange shirt Factory ;only gave away the ending on the first few chapters of the book. If you are interested in turn of the century N.Y and enjoy a good read try Jack Finney's books. This one is a disturbing read.
2,Impossible to get into,"Although certain chapters of this book were entertaining, to read the entire thing was a complete stuggle!! I found the chapters to be completely disconnected from each other which provided no continuity throughout. I would suggest skipping this book and finding something more enjoyable."
3,Don't read it in bed,"This seems to be a well-written and interesting book that conveys the atmosphere of the period. (I bought it because I was interested in the amusement park, Dreamland.) HOWEVER, it contains a lot of very disturbing violence such as animal abuse, sadistic killing and crippling of people, the portrayal of horrific poverty, sweatshop workers, child labor, etc., etc. Was the lower East Side of New York in the early 20th century really like this? Perhaps it was, but I found this book too disturbing to read before going to sleep. I read about a third of it and had to put it aside. I hope to work up my courage to pick it up again."
4,A Glorious Mess!!,"Read this book if you have eclectic tastes, love saucy descriptions, and want to revel in the work of writers who clearly love their work. It's rare that I read a book by someone and think, ""I'd love to meet this guy."" This is one of those times.The historical details of Coney Island, New York, and the labor movement in in the early 20th century are masterful, not only in their (mostly) accurate portrayals, but in Baker's ability to keep it lively, centered, and completely entertaining. I wish this book would have spanned twice the page count.Only four stars because there are lots of loose ends here and some scattergun artistic license (especially in the end), but I dare you to not have a good time with this book. I know I did, and I can't wait to read ""Paradise Alley"" next!"
5,Be transported,"I usually get bored with long books, and often feel that the author could have told the story in half as many pages. However, this book had me from the beginning and I had no trouble staying interested until the end, even though it weighs in at about 700 pages. Kevin Baker's secret is that he is so familiar with the historicl setting that he is able to write in such detail that you literally feel tranported to turn-of-the-century New York. The reader gets to know the characters and care about them, even the more eccentric ones. The story about the harshness of life is at times sad, funny, endearing, and even frightening. All 700 pages are worth the read."
4,"A Stirring, Moving Novel","Baker's ""Dreamland"" is a stirring novel, populated with vibrant characters and a sweeping storyline. Epic in scope, Baker almost manages to seamlessly integrate a variety of historical figures with imaginary, archetypal characters. Most surprising is his somewhat ambiguous ending, something that brings a tear to the throat and a pit to the stomach; it is more effective than any sorty of definitive conclusion. Baker's only real misstep is including the travels of Freud and Jung into his narrative. The two and their trip are only peripherally integrated into the novel, and their intermitten presence only draws away from the novel, particularly in the last chapter, which only squelches an otherwise perfect ending. Other than this, though, Baker's novel is a real triumph of heartfelt historical fiction."
3,"""Tribute"" or Soundalike?","There usually isn't a fine line between a tribute on one hand, and a soundalike recording on the other. On the former, even when arrangements are almost completely copied, the ""voice"" of the performer is still heard. On the latter, well, the point often is to deceive the customer or music programmer.""John Sawyer"" sings and plays extremely well, and sounds virtually like Taylor at times, so he (and any other musicians involved, although uncredited) displays talent and musicianship. But the packaging places Taylor's name in huge print, while Sawyer's name is much smaller, and the data on the CD, when pulled up on my computer, identified the artist as Taylor, not Sawyer. So this is veering dangerously close to ""soundalike"" territory.This will still be of interest to Taylor completists, but I personally prefer the originals. Best bets for downloading may be the more obscure cuts included here, as comparisons are less likely."
1,Alien Raiders,"I saw a preview for this movie and it looked good. It had elements of the movies The Mist and Intruder. However, this film pales in comparsion to those movies. A military group comes into a store because they suspect one of them is an alien. It sounds good but the acting was plain bad. Not as good as it looks and would stay away from this trash."
2,Boring Low Budget,"Boring story, low budget flick. A $10 cross between The Thing and The Mist. Crappy special F/X and even worse filming. Stay away unless you like cheap homemade film school flicks."
1,OMG so bad,"This movie was all TALK, nothing else. To compare it to The Thing is absurd.It barely rises above the minimum for acting as well.Not impressed, a waste of 3 bucks.Peu ~!"
2,"A RIP-OFF OF ""THE HIDDEN""","I don't know WHAT previous reviewers were watching but it had to be a different film from what I just saw. This was a boring and ineptly made film with little to offer.Everything was predictable including the ""finale"" where the ""creature"" is unmasked as a rip-off remake of a wannabe from ""The Hidden"" (a far superior film).You can pass on this one!"
2,good premse but so so predictable,"I really liked the opening few minutes. Brutal and relentless. But when 'the test' is carried out to see who is human and who is not, it is blatantly obvious who the 'King' is. I was just waiting for the moment in the film where someone says 'Wait....that's NOT THE KING!' It was BLATANTLY obvious this was going to happen and the person who turns out to be the KING overacts the role to such an extreme, it is doubly as blatant. This is a bit like Oasis compared to the Beatles. Absolute rubbish, trying to copy an idea, but being bland and predictable. Same comparison for 'The Thing' and this. In the former, the suspense is unbearable, and you have NO IDEA who 'The Thing' is. The clues are so subtle and intellectualised, that one can only spot them with repeated views. This is a huge let down for a movie that had bags of potential."
4,"Good stuff, the reviews are all spot on, well worth the rental fee!","I got a $5 Video on Demand credit and after looking through a bunch of sci-fi/horror selections (most of which I've seen), I came across this highly rated flick. It did not disappoint---it's a brisk 85-minutes with action, suspense, some tense moments, good storyline and acting. I'd definitely rate it above those special premiere movies-of-the month that SyFy usually showcases. I'll echo what some other reviews have said---don't read the synopsis, just watch it and enjoy the ride. It's a great value for a no-name movie and hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
2,Violent and disturbing,"Yikes! So sorry I listened to other reviewers. Although the premise was good, this film was much too violent and disturbing for a mentally-healthy person. (Definitely NOT for older teens as one person suggested!) My husband and I like horror, sci-fi, and the occasional gory movie (as long as it has comic-relief, e.g., Shaun of the Dead), but this was too intense. I'm wondering if Amazon could start posting the demographics (age group) of reviewers so we can judge reviews accordingly. Anyone?"
5,Excellent movie!,"Go with the majority of reviews and watch it! You won't be sorry - good characters, good action, good alien."
1,One star for a beginning and an end,"This proves that Amazon movie star ratings can not be relied upon. Obviously people connected with the movie are pulling the HORRIBLE movie up to 4 stars. Someone in the reviews said ""good special effects..."" oh really?... there were no special effects, none. ""Good Script""... there is not one thing that anyone does in the movie that would made sense in this situation nor... does it make sense in the plot line... like... why are alien hunters not supported by the government... well that would require money and extras... why do they use only pistols except one other weapon... that would be because the script writers are exceptionally stupid. OK enough time on this... the worst sci-fi movie I have ever seen. D O N ' T!"
4,That was pretty good!,Not a fan of B-movies or your typical sci-fi channel garbage. This one was pretty good. Didn't know any of the actors but they made a good movie. No cheap gore. They hinted enough to do the job. If you're looking for a science fiction/horror movie to watch tonight this one's worth checking out
5,A very well written story but .....,"As my title for this review infers, the story is a very plausible one but the way it's told is not. I wish to give no spoilers here. That said, with regard to the alien, it makes me all too aware that senseless violence and conflict has to be included in order to enhance movies for today's audience. Given today's mindset of society and the known tools available, I'm sure this ""raid"" (IF .. it were to actually happen) would proceed in a very different light. I was very impressed with ""who"" the respondents were and ""how"" the respondents learned about the ""Invasion"" and chose to respond. It was a very believable story, well acted and well filmed."
4,Alien Raiders - Bad title,"Really, this is a pretty good little indie. The story is way above B film, the acting is quite competent, and the filming is just fine. This is a nice surprise! For fans of suchlike, definitely give it a go."
4,Customer review,"This is a great guide for anyone interested in all kinds of wildlife native to the tropics. It is concise, well organized and well written and fits into your pocket so that you can take it virtually anywhere with you."
4,A brain-teasing mystery with a great subplot,"""C"" is a good brain-teasing mystery featuring my fave. detective Kinsey Millhone. She is as engaging and resourceful as ever, and not to mention funny. Her attachement and loyalty to Bobby was a great addition since Kinsey doesn't normal feel deeply about her employers. The killer and his motive was also shocking and the ending was very exciting and suspensful. The subplot involving Henry's girlfriend Lila was, IMO, better than the actual plot. It was humorous to see how Kinsey weaseled her way out of certain situations involving Lila and I loved seeing her and Roise team up. Ms. Grafton if we r reading this I would love to see more of Rosie. Some parts of the book were boring but still worth the time and money."
4,More Kinsey Intrigue,So far it's good- but it is pretty much just like all her other Kinsey books. It's light reading and I'm enjoying it.
5,Kinsey Milhone keeps me interested!,One of the things I love about the Kinsey Milhone series is that they are anything but formulaic. Every story is new and fresh. The side story of Kinsey dealing with a new member of their neighborhood is a nice way of making Kinsey something more than just a private detective. She's a person in a neighborhood and a community with friends and connections. There is nice continuity with her lunch with a former love interest. The main mystery is interesting and different. Lots of complex characters and settings. This is one I'll read again.
4,Great Stuff!!,"In 'C is for Corpse' Kinsey is hired by an amnesiac who feels that someone is stalking him. After he is killed, Kinsey proceeds with her investigation and eventually finds the killer.Kinsey is quite an interesting character. I love the way Sue Grafton writes. She cracks me up sometimes! Consider these quotes:""What comes back to me most clearly is the hangover I endured after the cocktail of barbiturates I was injected with.""""This was hotsy-totsy stuff. I wanted to say ""hubba-hubba"" but I was afraid she'd take offense."""
3,'C' is for Corpse,"What I appreciate most in Grafton's Kinsey Millhone series is her attention to realism. Kinsey Millhone is a professional private detective, licensed by the state, and operating in ""the real world"". The books stick to this idea, and present mysteries in an almost pedestrian manner; while in the middle of a case Kinsey stops by her office, sorts through her mail, drinks coffee, and goes grocery shopping. The little details of the day-to-day are all there, and while they may come off as a bit tedious at times (usually when you've read several books in a row, all with the same details), the overall effect is one of grounded reality. Kinsey is not a super hero; it is not unusual for her to encounter some extreme scenarios because it is in fact her job to pursue mysteries - or insurance fraud (after all, both pay the bills). 'C' is for Corpse is not an extraordinary book, but I can appreciate it for its consistency, and will continue to work my way back through the series."
3,subpar for Kinsey,"A young man horribly wounded in a car crash begins Kinsey's third mystery, but they plot behind his accident is unusually thin. Instead, the book divides its attention between the mystery at hand and the romantic escapades of Kinsey and her landlord - which, while they are well-written and interesting, detract from the suspense and intricacy of unraveling a mystery. Still, the book is a good read for Kinsey fans."
5,Another great letter of the alphabet story,I really enjoyed this book. I felt that this was one that tied up the loose ends of the story and giving an outcome for all of the pertinent characters. I was greatly intrigued and was guessing the whole time as to who the murderer really was. I would recommend this book highly. I feel that Sue Grafton has hit a home run with this one.
3,C for corpse,A good book except for the end. Does no one think that after ten minutes in a deserted morgue with no one around you would not suspect something was wrong. Ending could have been better.
3,C is for Corpse Review,"C is for Corpse is the 3rd book in the Kinsey Millhone alphabet mystery series by Sue Grafton. On Monday, Bobby Calahan met with Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone because he thought someone was trying to kill him. By Thursday, he was dead. Kinsey only has one clue: a little red address book and the name ""Blackman."" As usual, Kinsey discovers secrets as she digs deeper into the investigation. And again, her own life is in danger.As I hoped, the main character continues to develop, get involved in more mysteries and maintain her ordinary down-to-earth personality. The mysteries are not too predictable either. Is it too early to deem this series a winner?Literary Marie of Precision Reviews"
5,Amazon Book Purchase,"The book ""C is for Corpse"" was a Christmas gift to complete a collection for a person who was thrilled with it. It arrived in excellent condition. And the price was discounted! Also, it arrived sooner than I expected. Can't beat that!"
2,Not as suspenseful as I had hoped.,"I was hoping for a more thrilling mystery from the well known Grafton. This is the first one out of the series that I have read--maybe I should have started with a different one! These books were highly recommended to me...perhaps I was expecting too much, but I will not give up on Grafton...yet."
2,My first - and LAST - Kinsey Milhone debacle!,"It's tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how BAD it truly is, but Ms. Grafton has somehow earned a following, and as I've said before, there is something for everyone out there. After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: ""...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began.""I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter."
3,didn't finish it,"Maybe someday I will read it fully through. I started to read it and realized it was somehow about a car wreck and that's where I stopped reading it. I returned it to the library. You see I was in a horrific car wreck this year and I am still suffering, nine months later. The last thing I want to read about is a car wreck."
2,Sick at C; what will it be by Z?,"Though only the third book in this continuing alphabetized series, the plot formula is already old hat, leaving little mystery in this mystery. Too bad that Grafton, unlike Paretsky's VI Warshawski, doesn't add a political element or some other layer to make her books more dynamic."
4,Love Sue Grafton,I have read most of the alphabet books but missed this one. Sue Grafton is a very special mystery writer and she did a great job with this book.
5,C is for Cool,"As Sue Grafton winds her way through the alphabet, her stories are getting better and better. I have read up to ""V"", her latest, and can't wait to read the rest."
4,Such Drama and Suspense!,"""C is for Corpse"" by Sue Grafton is an intense book that leaves you craving for more of Grafton and her main character Kinsey Millhone. Kinsey is a single, middle-aged private investigator. In her newest case, Kinsey meets Bobby Callahan. He asks for her help in finding that tried to kill him, and left him with a bad memory, unable to remember many of the details of the accident that left him crippled and killed his best friend. Soon, Kinsey is in the middle of three mysteries, and asking questions that may put her life in jeopardy. The suspense is so thick that towards the end of the book I found myself skipping passages just to find out what happened next. Compared to the A and B books in the series, C was the most gripping."
5,C is For Captivating,This third mystery from is another winner in Susan Grafton's msytery series. Susan's flair for the dramatic is very strong throughout especially when she discovers the culprit who is responsible for the murders. As usual one can gather a clear picture of each of the major characters and many of the supporting players in this thriller. The characters are tied together better here than in other novels as you aren't taken down any long and winding trails.... This one captivates my mysterious soul.
5,Each is better than the last!,Have read all A to M. Grafton improves her writing technique and character with each book.
5,A great book for anyone who loves a mrystrey,I'm 13 and I really like these type of books. Once I picked up the book I couldn't put it down. The caracter Kindsey Millone is funny and very sly. These books are one of the only books I will read because other books can't grab my attention as well as these books.
3,"Well..... it was good, but.........","I hope her style of delivery has changed for the better.It was a decent read -- a cohesive story, with plot, characters all meshing to a good conclusion, but dangnabit -- it was bad enough for Kinsey to spout all those metaphors, remanding me of a 1940's mystery radio program spoof, but even WORSE - to EXPLAIN some of those metaphors in the very next sentence.Uh uh..... don't need that."
3,"I didn't think I would like them, but ...","I didn't think I would like them, but after I tasted one I enjoyed them. In fact, my wife purchased another box. I'll keep them around for when I want a snack."
4,The Slim Fast bar is good. It has ...,"The Slim Fast bar is good. It has a nice taste that reminds me of a Milky Way. This bar seems too peanut butter and chocolate-like for early in the morning, which is one of its main purposes. Otherwise I think that this Slim Fast bar is good for lunch."
5,I was pleasantly surprised at how good it ...,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. It's like having a candy bar! Plus, it's only four points on the Weight Watchers 1-2-3 Plan, so it's a great, healthy snack. It makes an easy meal on the go, and it's just the right size so I didn't feel deprived. This is much better than other """"diet"""" snack bars!"
5,"Underrated, if ever a band was.","Pinback is one of those bands that scream oft-overlooked, until the ""OC"" anyway. (And you thought that show sucked!) But some of the best money you could ever spend, aside from the Decemberists' records, is Pinback's discography.This one brings ""Anti-Hu"" to the masses, which is worth the money alone. Why it's not officially released on Amazon is beyond me."
3,Obviously a b-sides collection...,"First of all, I'm a HUGE Pinback fan. That fact alone does not make this a great album. It is a collection of b-sides and rarities, and thusly has a lot of inconsistencies in production, mood, etc. It does have some really good songs on it, but it isn't that impressive as a whole. If you already have everything else Pinback has to offer and thirst for me (like me) then go ahead and get this, but I'd recommend picking up the regular full-lengths and EPs first as this really is NOT representative of what the band is capable."
4,Mellow but Intense,"The India Navigation label rereleased many of its 70s and 80s recordings in CD format, and here is one of the best, made even better by the inclusion of several extra cuts on that did not appear on the original Spirit Sensitive LP. Spirit Sensitive, a 1979 collection of ballads that features Cecil McBee on bass, John Hicks on piano, and Billy Hart on drums, with appearances by Don Moye on drums and Jay Hoggard on vibes. Very mellow, yet very intense."
2,Problems with Dell computers,"It seems the mouse side does not work with some if not all Dell computers. In my case it failed on both Dell's I have, one is an Dimension 4300, another is a brand new server."
1,WORST PRODUCT I HAVE REVIEWED,Fortunately this item was quaranteed through AMAZON and I was able to get a full refund. The refund was not fast but was given eventually. Completely dissatisfied with product. Notably I have been the primary computer technical support for a local healthcare facility for the past 5 years. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Good for a basic switcher,"I have also encountered the freezing mouse problem (but only on the rare ocassion).I usually only use one computer at a time (Both running XP Home) but have on occasion used both switching back and forth.To reduce the need for two monitors, mice and keyboards; I think it is money well spent.[Edit]One of my computers was an always powered Mother Board and it would always default to that computer and would have to switch back. This is not a problem with the switch and I did not dock points for that but I am sharing this for your information."
4,"Device Works Fine, Buy with the Rebate","I hooked this switch up to a Dell Dimension 2400 P4 and an old Gateway P3. I'm dual booting on both boxes between XP Pro & Server 2003 R2. I'm also using a usb mouse with the usb/ps2 adapter plugged into the switch. I've been using it for several months and it's been working fine. About once every 2 or 3 weeks, the Dell will boot up with the screen zoomed about twice the normal size, but a simple restart resolves it. I've had no problems at all with the Gateway. There's a 1-2 second lag between switching from one PC to the other, but that seems standard. I would have preferred it to be wall mountable, but it sits on top of the PC and the cables don't take up too much space. This switch works fine and I recommend it to anyone who needs a KVM switch."
3,Doesn't handle all resolutions,"I don't know why exactly, but when using this switch with my wide-screen monitor, the 1680 x 1050 resolution was not available. Also I noticed that the switch doesn't work if only one of my computers is on (I suspect this is because it draws power from only one side). Other than that, it works fine."

1,Does not work for Sea Doo!,"Got one for my Sea Doo HX, the cap pops off all the time. Will not stay on. I ended up having to put a hose clamp on it to get it to stay on."
3,Eh,Got this for my Seadoo Speedster. Not long enough to reach from the key to the safety. Took a few good waves and the safety fell off causing everyone in the boat to get some good whiplash.
2,"Good lanyard, crappy Key","I bought two of these for a pair of 95 Seadoo XPs, they use the cap style pop offs. The old keys were falling off so we wanted to buy some new ones. The wirst strap and lanyard look to be made of good material. The cap section that is the 'key' keep falling off. I'm not sure what is wrong. It's like the rubber is too crappy to keep it's shape. I'm going to try to hit them with a lighter to stiffen them up or shrink them.The seller shipped the item fast, and packed them well."
4,"""Are You Ready?!!""","I received this as a Christmas present. I thought this season was really good and awesome! Criss Angel is the best at what he does! I love just about every episode in this season. If you love magic, illusions, and Criss Angel, you'll love CRISS ANGEL: MINDFREAK: SEASON 3!!!"
5,Awesome,"Criss Angel: Mindfreak The complete Season Three, is awesome. I have all the other seasons, but wow. It has an episode where he gets run over a steamroller and obviously survives but still entertaining to watch. So far my favorite season yet on DVD, but on TV is season 4 for sure. I can't wait for that to come out in October."
3,Cute but flimsy,The mat is very cute. My 2 yr. old son enjoys using it. My only complaint is that it's a little flimsy. I had expected a heavier mat maybe with rubber on the back but this is just thin plastic.
3,pictures flake off,"great fun - but the pictures rub off and leave white spots all over. I might try to get it laminated since it was SO expensive for a placemat!Quality is horrible, but my daughter loves the animals."
3,A Real Treat!,"Probobly the best Styx album nobody's ever heard. Inventive songs with excellent musicianship. If you like Styx, you really should investigate this one. I consider it a gem. Usually fairly priced, too!"
5,styx creates a lasting masterwork.,Styx on this one created a real masterwork. This hasn't a bad song on it and is a really solid in every regard. This one is truly a masterwork from this band it's progressive rock and yet it's more accessible than most prog rock in it's tight layered singing and playing. This version of styx is far from the good pop rock band they would become but that version was a good version too imo but this is like a rock masterpiece. (so is the grand illusion' imo).I just saw this band in colorado springs in 2011 and they still play 'lorelie' as good as back in this era! Which says alot about how good this cd really is.
4,A tad large,"Had five links removed, was a little too tight; one link replaced, is a little too large but not obnoxiously large. Years ago I remember seeing a ""Lady"" Officer's watch that was ""petite"" but couldn't find it online anywhere. It's a good looking watch and so far it works. :o)"
2,Not Satisfied,"Works fine, decent quality. Size is not what I would consider large. Picture makes it look much larger than it actually is."
5,Now I'm like a senior citizen with the strength of a 30 year old!,"I've had this mild, slightly apathetic curiosity to try one of these suckers out for my Manly Man supplements and vitamins for a while now, because some days I just forget to take it.I finally bit the bullet and bought it from this vendor (because, irritatingly, buying it from another vendor was prevented by Amazon's stupid ""Add-On"" feature), just to try.Now all I can say is: Why have I waited this long!??! In the month I've had this item, I have not forgotten to take my supps & vits at all! I feel so strong and full of nutrients!USEFUL: IF you happen to be a weaker human, the flaps MAY be a bit hard to pop open depending on your strength. Sometimes I have a wee wee wee bit of trouble myself, although I hate to admit it to anyone.Also, the case is a beautiful bionic see-through blue with bold white ""IMPACT"" S M T W T F S font, in case you need to match your decor!"
3,Incredible,"Here we go again, this album has a touch of vannila,strawberry,winan,shirley ceasar and felix too. It's very inspirational and uplifiting. I happened to be around or in that areas when album was in production and wooow! what an outcome.'nough respect and keep on shining""Silver shadow""Felix."
5,My favorite scent,"I've been wearing ""Maybe Baby"" for a few years and never tire of the aroma or the many compliments. I wish ""Benefit"" did not discontinue the larger version, the current size is gone in a short time. It is appropriate for all times of day and any occasion."
5,My all time favorite scent!,"I love love LOVE this perfume! I don't know how to describe it since everyone has their own preferences, but it is a nice light scent. I have had some perfumes react with my skin before only to smell like something completely different. This one did not do that & it stays on great."
3,"Maybe Baby you might try LAMB instead, same scent!",I was very disappointed when I got this that it was identical to my LAMB by Gwen Stefani. I already own LAMB which I like but I was hoping for something different. If you like Maybe Baby try LAMB it's cheaper and I had both on either wrist and couldn't tell them apart.
2,"One Terrible, One OK","There are 2 albums on this CD, the live one is unlistenable. It has to be the most annoying and obnoxious listening experince of my life!!! Awful!!! The other album is OK but not as good as I remember it, very dated... Skip this group!!"
5,"Five encores at Santa Monica, Calif.","In 1962, Maybe 63, I along with Mike Gris saw the Group at the Santa Monica auditorium, at the end of the show the audience stood and clapped for10 or fifteen minutes, The group, being good sports, came back for three or four encores. The audience still refused to leave and continued to clap foranother 10 minutes, I think the group was out in the parking lot. Someonegot them back for one last song. They told the audience that this was absolutly the last song. The live album here is very much like that performance. Thirty years later, at a reunion, Mike and I agreed it wasthe best concert we'd ever been to. Too bad you weren't able to be there,at least now we can all enjoy the album. It may be a guy thing."
5,Christmas CD,"My favorite old time, childhood Christmas songs!I'm so happy I was able to buy this CD - THANX!"
3,Light reading at best...,That's what it is.Not to be taken too seriously for historical accuracy or as a serious Harvard Business School management session.But nice book juggling two supposedly disparate topics.
1,history and fiction,"the author does does not seem to be qualified to tackle a historical subject, such as the strategy of Alexander the Great. The book provides a lot of 'information' some of which may be historically accurate but some is the author's 'guesses' as to what may have happened. There is no clear distinction between the two in the text and as you read through it, after a while it is hard to distinguish what is history and what is fiction. Not worth the time reading this, unless you are interested in reading a novel, rather than a historically accurate text"
3,Tena incontinence pads,"I was so surprised at the price of these pads. It said they were Tena pads and the package looked just like the Serenity Tena pads I have been purchasing but at half the price.These pads say ""Tena"" but not ""Serenity"".Shipment came immediately but it appears they are not as absorbent as the ones I had purchased previously.The package does say ""light"" though they are sold as ""heavy long"". They work fine but I find I have to use more.I would still use them but can not find the company from which I purchased them. I have the invoice but no web site. They are not listed on Amazon anymore."
4,"Go aheadh and try it,,,",You will like this product. I think this was made for normal day time use. Very pleased with it. You will too
4,TENA pads,These are my mother's preferred product for her incontinence. It gives her security when she is out while being comfortable. Thanks for carrying this product.
1,Tena NOT pool proof,"Tena (Serenity) Ultra, may be ""Twist Proof"" as they currently advertise on their commercials, but they are not Pool Proof. Disintegrates into a masses of wet water logged cotton pieces.However: Poise Pad, Ultimate Long, totally POOL Proof! Gets larger, as it does what it supposed to (absorb liquids), but it stays it one piece, stays secure in your swim suit.Speaks volumes to me!!"
1,DON'T BUY THESE,"Warning company changed their product!! These pads are now so thin they hold very little moisture. You have to use 2 pads together now, and you know what they cost.They use to be the best on the market it seem like they are making them thinner but keeping the price the same. These are the heavy weight ones,BEWARE."
1,New and Inferior,"I read the reviews, mostly negative, but decided to try them anyway. I still have part of a package purchased a year ago or more and that product is excellent. This new product is terrible. It comes in the same packaging and labeling as the old package but, the quality of the pads is well below par. The material wads up and breaks up when moist, making it very uncomfortable, not to mention the loss of protection. The pads tend to leak at the sides. DON'T BUY THESE. IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Moderate Not LONG,The moderate absorbency long pads are not long at all. They are labeled as such but are just regular length.
1,STill with purple dye,"I ordered these thinking they were the clean white product, but they still have the purple dye unlike how the picture portrays them."
4,panty liners,Hello- I bought this item for my elderly mother and they seem to be working well...she has not complained so life is good! Thanks so much! Nice getting in larger quantities!!!
4,One erotic rea,Once again Lacey Alexander delivers a erotic romance to spice up the day. This story takes the reader to a hot area both in story and location - Key West.
4,Must read for anyone who wants to understand life insurance!,"It's a big book for casual reading, but you get more information out of the first chapter than you would get from hours of talking with an agent."
5,The truth about life insurance,This is a book that everyone should own. If you want to save money and not be scammed by bad life insurance people. This book may not be around for long because the life insurance industry does not want you to know the truth and how to protect yourself. This book can help you protect your family and friends. This book is a must buy.
4,What's Wrong With Your ife Insurance,I purchase this book for my husband and he said it was full of helpful information that he will be using in his new Primerica business.
1,Don't waste your money,"These bulbs took a bit to warm up and come up to full brightness which was great in the morning when my eyes were adjusting, but inconvenient any other time. One by one these bulbs ""stopped working"" after about 3 - 4 months. I say stopped working, because they didn't burn out. The ballast (a switch built into the base of fluorescent bulbs) seemed to go out. One of the bulbs would go on and off if you thumped it. After three of the six bulbs went out, I went and bought ""normal"" incandescent bulbs for the bathroom. Also, these bulbs were much, much more expensive and not worth it. Don't waste your money."
2,POOR,"Almost nothing valuable on this disc. Old tracks, to repetitive, boring.For me 'sleeping murder' is the only great track, the rest is a big dissapointment if you compare with Angels of disrtess that was great doom, full of draft and deep emotions."
2,descsent,This Album is contain an old songs that you canfind in other albums!Why?The new songs are not at the same level of funeral genre.It`s a different style that i frankly don`t like.
1,Ridiculous Is Right,"With the abundance of fine, original haiku that has been produced in English over the past thirty years, it's sad to see a major publisher like Simon and Schuster launch this unfunny, self-indulgent mess. The imagery is merely gross, the jokes old, the witticisms tired and vacuous, the quality of imagination on a par with the last schoolyard cliche. Venokur's work is neither haiku nor poetry but it does get high aces for achieving a kind of ridiculous waste of paper and ink. The same energy could so easily have gone into a collection of real merit (and of other poets' work), turning kids on to the world around them as only haiku can do. . . but that is another book."
3,Poetry CAN be fun!,"Whether or not this is a collection of great poetry is not the question. The questions is: will a bunch of kids like these haikus? And the answer is, yes! This book shows kids that poetry isn't just a bunch of flowery language describing a blade of grass. Poetry can be fun. This book also shows kids that they can write their own poetry and it doesn't have to be serious. Kids aren't serious, they're kids! They like to play and joke around. Their poetry should reflect that.This book is a great way to open the door of poetry to a bunch of kids who might otherwise write it off as ""boring""."
2,I don't believe this product should be consumed at all,"Seems to be generously proportioned but the anise stars themselves appear to be for decoration in a potpourri vase. They came dusty, freckled, and hazy looking; I obviously can not consume them and are now uselessly store in my cupboard!"
3,Juvenile and probably not accurate,"I picked up this little volume,written by Robert Penn Warren, because I really liked ""All the King's Men"" and much of Warren's poetry. ""Remember the Alamo!"", however, reads more like a kiddie history of the battle from the view point of the late 1950s. It is an OK read, although, there are some glaring inaccuracies due to Warren using second-hand information (like the escape of Rose). This will never take the place of Walter Lord's superior ""A Time to Stand."" If you have sixth or eighth graders at home, it might be a nice intro to the battle, but most adults (I suspect) would expect a better performance from a writer of Warren's cailber. [To the publishers--it would be nice, in future editions, if you would reset the several spelling typos found in the book.]"
2,Even Pulitzer Prize-Winners Write Less than Steller,"I'm not sure if I got what I paid for. I picked up this book as a quick read for a brief introduction to the Alamo and got exactly that; however, I was disappointed to find out the book reads at a third grade level with below-caliber writing from Robert Penn Warren. Because the book was originally published pre-Civil Rights Movement, the book reeks (especially at its beginning) of anti-Native American sentiment (still portrayed as savages and uncivilized) and occasionally dipping into the anti-Mexican (I guess this one is obvious because it was the Americans versus them). If it weren't scribed by Warren, this book would have been lost a long time ago. I wouldn't even suggest giving this to a child to read because its view points are very biased. Luckily there are better written and researched books about the Alamo."
1,very misleading,"this item is supposed to come in a 2 disk package and only came with one which is only one half of the program, a total waste of money, it didnt even come in a protective jewl case as advertised!! it came in a photocopied piece of paper kind of envolope and i will never buy from this seller again"
1,"It ""opens"" very slowly, then you are faced with a blank box that never fully opens. Very disappointed.","It ""opens"" very slowly, then you are faced with a blank box that never fully opens. Very disappointed. Children frustrated."
3,Great Doo Wop,This CD has only one song that was popular but it has one whole side that was done purely accapella and the songs on this side are fantasic.
5,Civil War Battles: Atlanta Campaign by HPS Simulations,"I have played many of the Civil War and Napoleonic battle games from TalonSoft (mostly against a friend by email), and thought they were great. The battles in this HPS Simulation game are even better, because HPS gives you the option letting the game generate automatic defensive fire, which speeds up play a great deal. I have yet not tried the campaign game, which is another plus."
1,"Comics, they aint...","These guys spend so much time trying to be funny, (which is refreshing at first but by chapter 3 it's way over the top.)they forget to teach you anything about Contracts....Be ready to buy plenty of Emanuel's or E and E supplements if you want to learn the course...."
2,Owner,I had to alter the finder bib a little to make it fit my bike but that was no biggie and was expected. There was nothing available for a 03 Heritage Springer. It looks good on the bike. The only complaint I have is that there is a little pucker in the bib which makes it not lay consistently on the finder at all points. I also did not realize the material was a vinyl. I should have known for the price it would not be leather. All in all I like the product.
1,Cheap,This book is a rip off. It is very small and has only 4 tiny pages of stickers. Children are supposed to put stickers on a small backround that serves as the cover for the book. Definately not worth the money.
3,Good Historical Tidbits,"There are better books for learning and understanding the Laws of the Game---I'd highly recommend David Ager's ""The Soccer Referee Manual"" (http://www.amazon.com/Soccer-Referees-Manual-David-Ager/dp/0809297353/ref=pd_sim_b_3) for reading on this subject.That said, the author touches on some of the history of the game, and includes anecdotes on why some laws have been added or modified to FIFA's codex over the years-- and for that it's very interesting.I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to understand the LOTG in historical context -- but would recommend the above book for a better explanation of the Laws -- and would point you at ""The Art of Refereeing"" for a truly top-notch manual on how to officiate a high-level match."
1,Problems playing DVD,Problems with DVD. Not sure if it is an Original Copy I received. Got from a second party on Amazon.
4,So good I am going to order my own copy,"I am a native Californian, raised in Long Beach, California. Perhaps that influenced my extreme enjoyment of this novel. It seemed almost autobiographical for Ms. Ayers. I also noticed the typos and missing punctuation, but I was so thoroughly enjoying the wonderful story that they did not bother me. That Bostonian complainer should lighten up! I would like to join the other reviewers in urging a sequel. I would buy a copy of that one sight unseen!"
4,"Great Season, okay quality",The material of season two was phenomenal. The quality that amazon gives you is just okay though. Sub par. I've only watched the season because it was free on Amazon Prime.
5,Hmm,"This is a heart-wrenching episode that shows one of the few times where Aang becomes angry enough to trigger the Avatar State. And he had every right to be angry, since some dirty desert people stole his beloved companion Appa, putting the kids in dire straits as they are now stuck in the desert. The humor mainly comes from Sokka after he gets high from cactus juice."
3,"Love the show, hate the DVD's","I am extremely disappointed in Nickelodeon's marketing of the DVD's. First of all, there is absolutely no reason to sell Season 1 on 5 seperate disks other than to make as much money as possible from a bunch of 12-year-old's. Secondly, Its also pretty scummy of them to put a block on skipping the previews because God forbid you might escape them with a few bucks left in your pocket. And lastly, there are no extras wirth the name.I got into this show with my kids last year and think its probably the most intelligent cartoon series I've ever seen. If they keep filling their bloated pockets at kids' expense then I probably won't buy anymore disks firsthand and wait til they are on eBay at a discounted rate."
1,This is Horrible,"I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..."
5,It's the full season...,"I do not know why people keep rating CONTENT on Amazon based on their incorrect perceptions of Amazon's services and offerings. But just so everyone is clear, not only is this the full season, but Amazon is giving it to you at a bargain. Amazon has two ""double"" episodes here (""Secret of the Fire Nation"" and ""The Guru/The Crossroads of Destiny"") -- these are both ""hour-long"" (48 minutes without commercials) episodes that ran as two airings each on TV (SotFN ran as ""The Serpent's Pass"" and ""The Drill,"" while ""The Guru"" and CRoD ran under those titles). So this is the full season, and Amazon could be charging $4 more for it! Stop bellyaching and enjoy!"
2,Open note to Nickelodeon,"Dear Nickelodeon execs,I really do want to buy these dvd's for my family - but I won't. Not yet. You could release the whole season in one set, just like the very successful Batman or Superman Animated series. But you aren't. So I'm holding off.Avatar is a great show, and deserves better treatment than this."
