1,I love Opeth but this one sucked!,"I am a huge Opeth fan but I was so disappointed when I got this CD. The first time I put it in my cd player I thought I had accidently gotten a defective one where they put some other bands cd in my case. I kept popping it in and out and trying to figure out why I was listening to what I would call ""pop"" music. I understand now that this was some wild attempt on Opeth's part to do something different but if I had wanted to listen to soft, spineless stuff I would have ordered The New Radicals or Lit.Booooooooooooo on this one. I LOVE the rest of their stuff."
1,Boring!,"First off, i will listen to this album again for the third time and see if my opinion changes, if it does I will change my rating: in the mean time, this music is annoying and outdated! i want to smack the guy who called this black metal. Oh, and yes, I do have one of their other albums, which is way better than this one, so i do like some of their stuff (I got blackwater park) anyway, i never wanted to eject a cd out of my player so bad in all my life. There is no emotion in this music, its terrible! Its not angry, its not sad, its not happy, it does not have a good beat, good riff, good anything! If you like ""we had joy we had fun, we had seasons in the sun"" maybe this is for you, then again, even that song is better than this stuff...did I say that?"
1,Why Did Kerrang Give This 5/5?,"Opeth did something different this time around. Like many good bands, and failed miserably, like many good bands. Deliverance came out around the same time, and its SO much better. Although Deliverance isn't REALLY heavy, its a lot heavier than this. Damnation is very acoustic and soft, and BORING. Seriously, go buy My Arms, Your Hearse, or Deliverance."
1,Disappointing,"I am a huge Opeth fan. I enjoy both there ""softer"" songs and there heavier songs. I was intrigued when I heard that they were going to release a album full of all soft slower songs. When I purchased this album and threw it in, I was extremely disappointed. I was expecting to hear songs reminiscent of Credence, A Fair Judgment, the slower parts of songs like Deliverance, When and The Drapery Falls ect. What I got was this bunch of crap. This is a worthless release by one of the best bands in the world. I can only hope that this is not a sign of things to come.I recommend purchasing any and every Opeth album released before this one and leaving this one on the shelf. It is not even worth the curiosity, it's that bad."
1,Are you kidding me? How can your write THAT much about this?,"This CD should have come with a warning label - ""Artist went on a creative sojourn for this offering - buy at your own peril because it's really not very good and we're sorry.""I've seen the reviews that say these guys are so versatile and that they're paying homage to blah, blah, blah. Maybe Rob Halford's next CD could explore the depths of Ronnie Milsap's influence on, uh well, nevermind."
2,Old School Opeth Fans Beware!,"Old school Opeth fans would not have expected this. I certainly didn't. While the bands musical talents are definately showcased in this album it most certainly isn't something I wanted to spend my ""death metal"" money on. I have come to expect classical interludes and clean vocals in Opeth albums but I didn't want an entire album of easy listening music. I'm a huge fan of Opeth (and Bloodbath) and I appreciate all good music but have to say that I was expecting and/or hoping for something with a punch. Opeth did not deliver the sounds an old school Opeth fan would expect on this album."
4,NOT the best of mellow opeth!,"With all the reviews of this album I have not heard one objectively negative thing from a fan (hardly). This is a good album, sure. I do prefer the albums that have a mix of heavy and mellow opeth but this is good nonetheless. BUT...I was expecting more out of this cd. In my opinion the songs on here generally don't match songs like ""To Bid you Farewell,"" ""Credence,"" ""Face of Melinda,"" ""Drapery Falls,"" ""A Fair Judgement,"" ""Atonement,"" or ""Isolation Years."" Everyone says this is mellow so it is different then other Opeth albums and then they do not venture to compare it to other Opeth albums. It is in fact legitimate to compare this to other Opeth albums because they have done mellow songs on all of their albums since morningrise. This is good but it could have been better."
3,Unique but not totally required,"3 1/2It was nice to hear a darker metal group taking that tone into acoustic realms. Not being a huge fan of death metal in general, this tends to get the most play out of Opeth's above-standard releases in the house, but what was initial enthusiasm in the approach has diminished to more standardized appreciation with eight powerful, if fleeting melodic memories."
5,Music does not get better than this,"If you are looking for a death metal CD, this isn't it. Regardless, you may not find a more impressive set of tracks then those found here. Its the preverbal ""pop it in and forget about it"" CD. Every track is amazing. I personally think its there best outside of maybe Blackwater Park."
3,Another quality release from Opeth,"I like Opeth. These guys consistently release quality material and Damnation is no different. My only beef with this album are the first three songs. The vocals are too, well, girly. They just dont do it for me. The remaining songs are wonderful and morosely beautiful. With a release like this I wonder why there are not more singles playing on like Mtv (my-bad they dont play music anymore) or adult contempo radio stations. Opeth does not suck and over 95% what is played on Adult contempo radio do suck. Still a large portion of American listeners are just too juvenile to like or understand quality music. (If you like bands like Opeth your not included).If It would of gottne four stars if it werent for the first few songs."
4,An interesting turn,This is not your typical opeth album. Instead of the awesome black and prog mix we are used to we get treated to a very smooth and murose album. All the songs on this album are soft and melodic but don't let that stop you from picking it up. I think it would have been interesting if they put one hard song in there (like they put one soft in deliverence) but still no complaints. 4.5 stars if you are an opeth fan it will not dissapoint. favorite songs are track 1 and 2.
4,What I expected - but great!,"We were told this album would be a change from the previous 6. It does not have any death vocals or heavy guitar parts, but that is not to say this isn't great, and vintage Opeth. Vintage because it is an album not unlike the ""clean"" songs on the other releases. However, the writing is much stronger and the music flows seemlessly with an absolutely great production (courtesy of Steve Wilson). Same somber, melancholic approach as before. No true new elements to the music, except perhaps a mellatron, and keys in the background of a good number of the songs. 70's prog rock/pyschedelic reminscent of early Pink Floyd in my opinion. No time for a truly in depth review here, but highly recommended to Opeth fans and those with an open mind."
4,Warning! There is no metal on this album...,"This is a good album, but you should know that it contains zero death metal! Yes, it may seem shallow to not buy an album because it isn't death metal, but I'm sure some people would rather buy one of their metal albums if they knew in advance. This is a very mellow album and is entirely acoustic (except for a few notes here or there).If you are looking for something heavy, then for God's sake get another Opeth album. If you're open minded and want to hear whatever they put out then this album is for you.Like I said: Good album, but no metal."
4,A great CD!,"I've always liked Opeth, ever since I heard of them. All of their albums that I own are excellent. I especially enjoyed the melodic and light tracks that were included in at least one song from each CD.When I first heard of a CD by Opeth that was all light music, I was hesitant to buy it. After listening to a few tracks, I decided it was an excellent album! Some tracks are repetitive, but all around this is one of Opeth's greatest. Sure, they could have hired the lyrical depth on a majority of the CD, but I was still pleased with it. I highly recommend this to anyone, Opeth fan or not."
4,After three (3) listenings........,"It's the Heaviest SLOW Metal Band I've heard.For sure buying a couple more of Opeths CDs.Specially after reading that this is their weakest or softest Release.None the less, being a Porcupine Tree fan & quite old (50 Years, for this generation).I'm impressed and loving Opeth.The more I listen to this; the more INTENSE it becomes (regardless of the acoustic dominance), incredible musicianship.Patience is ""Acquiring the Taste"" (from a Gentle Giant).Keep it up Boys NICE WORKJust 4 Stars till I hear the other CDs."
2,wut is this?!,"i only got to listen to the samples, but it sucks! You want a real band? buy Tool. Tool is much better than this crappy band"
1,Reviews On Bad Music Impeed My Chance To Find New Bands,"I am new-comer to Amazon, but not good music.I thought it was a great idea that other peoples reviews and recommendations(to include amazon.com's) may lead me to newexciting music similiar to my taste. Tt is a big world, right?Well I was lead to this piece of garbage for an album!I really cant express in words how horrible this album isso i'll just say i broke the cd in half with my bare hands!it gave me more gratitude to break the cd than to re-sell it!I guess I can lead out this review by saying. If you psuedo-intlectual wanna-be's that cannot immediately find somethingentertaining about a cd don't analyze it untill you can comeup with enough material to justifiy giving them 5 stars."
5,EXTRAORDINARY!,"If you like Opeth's softer acoustic side, you will adore this album! I have always loved the softer and harder sides of Opeth but in Damnation its all soft, but there are still some points where your like AHHHH YEAH!!!!!! But Mikael never growls, clean singing very beautiful! thanks to Steven Wilson who helps out on the backing vocals every once and a while. Also, ths mixing is GREAT! Not a single weak point in my opinion. BY THIS ALBUM NOW!"
5,This album is beyond reality.,I cant belive u Opeth.u just expressed my feelings.U r supernatural with ur talent.U r the best Band in the world .
5,different...........yet amazing,"now you may think i am just some[one] who only likes the soft opeth songs. Well your wrong, i love everything opeth has done. so i simply say this. if u are a true opeth fan i think u would love this album...........buy it!!!!"
3,"What happened, Mikael?","First off, I love Opeth. Mikael Akerfeldt is one of my personal heroes. But this latest cd somewhat let me down. It was all clean-voice acoustic. Now don't get me wrong, I think Opeth are the masters of the clean-voice acoustic passage, but these sections are usually still fast-paced and loud enough to enjoy. But on Damnation, the songs are so slow and soft, they quickly became boring. ""Boring"" is a term that should never be used to describe an Opeth release. But here, it fits. I was also discouraged by the short length of the songs and the fact that the songs remain the same throughout their entire duration. One of Opeth's strongest points was their ability to completely change tempo, rift, atmosphere several time in each song! Having said all of that, if you are an Opeth fan you should still own this. Once again, Akerfeldt wrote all of the music and lyrics on the album, and his musical mastery alone is worth the $18."
4,My first Opeth experience,"I bought this album on a whim having never heard Opeth, but having read acclaims to their work. It sounds like it could have been made 30 years ago. I hear the King Crimson album ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" and early Sabbath stuff like ""Planet Caravan"" and ""Solitude."" The songs are mellow and the guitars sound great. The drumming sounds great. The mellotron and stuff really give it an aged feel like that first Crimson album. I later searched the Internet for other Opeth stuff and was surprised at what I heard. I now realize this is a special release and uncharacteristic of what I've heard on the ""Deliverance"" album. If you like Opeth before, this may be different for you, but it sounds great. Give it a shot!"
3,strange factory edge.,"The factory edge is strange. There is a second angle from the shinogi to the cutting edge. I am in the process of fixing this on a rough stone, however a 1 hour sharpening session did not do the trick. It might take a few more sharpening sessions.The knife is well balanced and feels good in the hand.The blade is perfectly straight and even has the slight concave on the back side.This knife is perfect for a chef experienced in sharpening knives! If not, go buy a global or a shun."
2,Not what it appears to be,"This radio was half the size that I expected it to be, and would hardly pick up the strongest radio station we have. Horrible quality and buy."
2,"Eh, so so!",Not crazy about it. Haven't used it much. I do like how it looks. I think it's just so-so....
5,Can't live without it,"My daughter is 11 months old and has LOVED It's a big big world since she was just a few months old. We own evey dvd. The things I love about the dvd are: It starts playing on its own so all you have to do is put it in the dvd player, the dvd has several episodes each with at least two songs each, there is a play songs only option in the menu, after the dvd is finished playing it starts again without prompting, it teaches children about nature. There is nothing bad I would say about this dvd except I know just about every word by memory now."
5,Wonderful Children's Program!!!!,"My 8 month old daughter absolutely loves this PBS show! The DVD features over an hour of episodes and 5 or 6 different songs. The characters, lessons of discovery and science, and music are all fantastic. My daughter smiles, laughs and tries to interact w/ the characters while watching. I am so thankful that it this show is finally available on DVD."
3,Good for beginners but not enough...,"This is very good for beginners(as title said). But within 2months, it wasn't necessary for me. If i were you, I would borrow it from library and read it then give it back. That's enough..."
2,Strictly a Picture Book,"Skip the text in this little book. Instead, read the jacket notes. There is no new information about Mademoiselle Chanel and the already well-known history of her life is so obtusely written the text seems like an outline of a romance novel.This is a book to own only for the archival photographs and the ""select chronology"" of Coco's fashion house that still thrives--some 25 years after her death. Snapshots of some of the male influences in her life finally put faces to names. However, a photograph of her best friend, Madame Misia Sert, is noticeably missing and should have also been included.Interspersed with the photographs are whimsical montage illustrations by Karl Lagerfeld, the current design director of Chanel. There are also a few photographs from modern advertising campaigns epmphasizing, even more, that this is not a must-read"
1,Basic dosage calculations incorrect,"I would not recommend buying this book to study for your boards. Question 1-17 and 3-27 have basic math errors in the dosage calculation. After discovering that two of the first three dosage calculations questions were incorrect, I no longer desire to study from this book. I contacted the publisher and he made the insinuation that I did not know what I was talking about, that I was calculating the problems incorrectly, and refused to refund my money. After studying chapters one and three, I decided that this source was unreliable since the author made basic math errors."
1,Don't waste your money....,"This is probably the worst NCLEX style book I have ever used. It is quite a small book (with a small amount of ""easier"" questions and skimpy rationales). I have heard that there are errors with the math questions, but I didn't use this guide for the math."
4,Nclex med Review,Great book to reinforce how the questions are given to you. I used this book and passed my RN NCLEX test.
3,"Good content, floppy disk outdated","This book is well organized by drug category and there is a practice test for each section. However, the book comes with a 3 1/2 floppy disk. Most new computers do not include a floppy drive as standard equipment, so I think it could use an update to a CD-ROM."
5,Pharmacology for NCLEX,This is a great book! It has helped me out so much with learning the meds that I need to know to get through nursing school. (and then for the NCLEX.)
1,Predictable and boring,"I can't agree less with the other reveiwers. To me it sounds like second rate Sisters of Mercy. The whole thing is very dull, with little excitement, no frills and is very predictable and stock standard off the shelf goth cd, so I suggest you give it a miss."
2,"Great story, average telling","The subject matter of this book was fascinating, but I just found the telling of it left me wanting. The first three-quarters of the book is a dry re-telling of history, much of it not particularly relevant to the rivalry. And was there no attempt to revive the football series for 30 years after it was cancelled? There's no talk of it in the book and if it didn't happen, it should be noted. It seems unlikely that nobody wanted to revive it."
5,Don't miss it!!!!,"Great band, great athmosphere, this is for sure an album that you can't miss if you are an indie music lover! The mosaic of delicate sounds, deep voice and excellent strings background make this album more better than Belle and Sebastian last record.The Ladybug athmosphere remind me the black and white french movies from the 60s. Fantastic!!!!!"
1,Bad album,"I like thier earlier stuff...it's not perfect, but it's kind of sweet. This is just plain bland music. Really really bad. They should be ashamed of themselves and hide in a cave. What were they thinking?Mad mad bad."
2,Not So Hot,"...And that's a generous 2 stars...OK, perhaps I'm not a big fan of their sound, but I find it hard to recommend anything about this disc. It's mellow for sure, and a little twangy, but you can't call it alt-country. The lead singer pretty much proves that just about anybody with a voice can be a singer. There are no outstanding performances here. What's all the fuss about this band??? You'll probably end up doing what I did and listen to it a few times....but how can a disc like this be anything more than that, to anybody?????"
5,This is a great film with great actors!!,What a great experience with a beautiful talented cast and crew ;)My favorite scene is the one with the lead (Michael Eisner) and Albert(me).
4,Darkest Day Of Horror,"Although Mortician usually sound pretty much the same on every recording it's not neccesarily a bad thing. I was rather baffled to hear that Mortician is ""noise"" from a reviewer. hmmm well I do listen to my share of Merzbow and Mortician isn't noise. Mortician definetly has riffs. oh yeah and just because it isn't technical or melodic or whatever doesn't mean it's bad. Hey the Rolling Stones never made any technical songs, or melodic songs. they still rock. and since when can you decipher any notes from Disgorge Mexico's guitars? Disgorge mexico is a lot more ""noisy"" than Mortician. and I wouldn't say Devourment is THAT brutal. They are sorta weak. Anyways this is just another Mortician album...your best bet is to buy Chainsaw Dismemberment if you like this band. Plus how could you not love that bass tone!?"
5,BETTER THAN DOMAIN OF DEATH.,I have always liked this band ever since I listened to house by the cemetary.People always complain that this band is not very technical or that they are not very talented.This band has never claimed to be very skilled musicians but have only promised to be unrelentlesly brutal.I just love that detuned sound in this album and it has very memorable songs.The movie samples are great just like they always are and the songs are very fast.They may not be the most talented death band but they sure are one of the most brutal and heavy of all bands.GO OUT AND BUY THIS!!!
1,Darkest Day of Horror *cough*,"""Darkest Day of Horror"" is another horrible offering from one of the worst bands ever. I'm not talking about Limp Bizkit! I'm talking about Mortician. Here are the things that make this album just as horrible as their last one. The first thing that makes this album horrible is that the bass and drum machine are to loud. It is hard to hear Roger's guitar playing in some of the songs not that it matters any way, because all he does is play on the same frets in every song, but in different tempos and sometimes different tunings. The second thing that makes this album horrible is Will's bass playing. Just like Roger Will plays the same frets in every song, but in different tunings and tempos. Don't be tricked into buying this album, because it is horrible and I wouldn't even consider it music. Mortician have a brilliant use of horror samples, but horrible music if you can even call it that."
5,Watch lyrics of this karaoke cassette on your TV!,All you need is the Super K player. Lyric sheet included as well.Songs are:An everlasting loveFanny be tender with my loveHow can you mend a broken heartLonely daysYou should be dancing.Be a Bee Gee and make your whole family jump with joy.
1,Croscill Fabric Shower Curtain Liner gets 1 star out of 5,"When I googled for a shower curtain liner that has weights at the bottom of it, Croscill Fabric Shower Curtain Liner at Amazon.com appeared. When I further read the reviews at Amazon, a couple of them also said the liner was weighted. I was looking for a liner with weights at the bottom because when I turn on the shower, the curtain leaves the side of the tub and wraps itself around me..... very annoying! So, I purchased the curtain in good faith and installed it and when I took a shower, the liner wrapped around me. After speaking with a representative at Amazon.com, I returned the liner, thinking it was defective. A replacement liner was sent. I installed it and jumped into the shower. The curtain wrapped around me!! If you are looking for a liner that will stay against the side of the tub rather than wrap itself around you, then don't get this one. I give this liner 1 star out of 5."
1,"This is not a ""liner""","It seemed like such a bargain. But seeing as how this shower curtain is uncoated polyester, mists water, and is not, by any stretch of the term, ""waterproof"", this is in fact not a shower curtain liner as described and should not be falsely sold as such. If you buy this you will either need a drain on the floor around your shower, ample towels to wipe up the water on the floor that mists through the fabric, or a PVC shower curtain liner to back this decorative curtain."
2,Didn't even last for 10 months,"By washing once a week and breaching occasionally, I hoped it would last longer, but it had to be replaces before 10 months. It gets mold and mildew very easily and they don't come off even after using chloride. We have very large window in the bathroom and never had mold issue with previous curtains. The material is only medium duty and water can leak out from bottom if your shower is strong. I loved the color and simple design, but would not recommend it."
2,Croscill Shower liner,"This is a beautiful product. It is better as a shower curtain, then a liner. It is not waterproof. I am returning it as I have a curtain and need a non plastic waterproof liner. Rated it down due to it not being waterproof."
5,Great fabric shower curtain liner,"Going back to the fabric curtain liner, I can't believe I ever used plastic. While it is true, some water can get through (it is fabric after all), I've had no problems unless I face the showerhead directly toward the curtain. The fabric liner dries quickly and does a great job protecting the shower curtain. Couldn't be happier."
5,High Quality and Nice Color,"What can I say? This is an excellent inner-side shower curtain for the money. Nice material, nice color. Highly recommended."
4,great accesory!,"I bought this piece as a trio set for a weeding gift to my best friend, so personaly I have no idea how good it is. .. but she cannot stop raving about this product!!"
5,It's washable and worth the money.,"I usually buy plastic shower liner. They're inexpensive but water always finds it's way out of my shower and onto my floor. Not a lot of water, but enough that I need to towel off the floor after each shower. I find that the cheapo plastic liners like to develop that nasty pink mold. Which means I buy them more often than I'd like. I decided to buy a fabric shower curtain liner after using one at a hotel on a recent vacation. I've had it for about a week and like how the shower curtain closed flush against the shower stall. Look Ma, no leaks! As for my shower liner's natural enemy, The pink mold. I have yet to see any, but if I do I can just toss it in the wash and go on with my glamorous life."
4,Love this shower curtain!,It is FAR superior to the plastic liners of yore... I am officially converted to the fabric liner genre...
2,Do Not Order if you need them to match,"I have an over-sized corner tub. My husband recently hung curtain rods from the ceiling so I could hang two shower curtains. Sort of Opera style. I have not measured the width on each but one is clearly 70"" long and the other is 72"" long. It looks odd, especially since I wanted to keep them closed. Since they have grommets on the top and a bottom serge stitch, there is not much I can do. Next time I will buy local."
2,Mildews easily,"This curtain is attractive. I've never had a problem with it leaking. However, it began to mildew after about 2 months and is not weighted at the bottom. I will not be purchasing another from this company."
5,Great product....,"This is a really nice shower liner. It stays in place, it repels the water, it is really very nice. I will never go back to the gross plastic things, the mold, the slim, the smell, they don't stay in place.....they are just a pain. Also,consider using fabric liners instead of plastic to avoid the chemicals that are released off the plastic ones."
1,Gillian,"I must have gotten the wrong product, because not only does this curtain get mildew, but the grommets got rusty too and left horrible rust marks on the curtain.....do not buy."
5,Goodbye Vinyl !!,"This is the nicest shower curtain I ever owned. I have previously only had a fabric shower curtain liner whenever we stayed at a hotel, most of which seemed to envelope you while you were taking a shower. I was tired of replacing vinyl liners as my boys would rip the gromets right out of anything. This curtain stays right where it belongs and looks amazing, and my boys are in no way going to rip out the gromets. Super high quality in my opinion. You can see light thru it also so it isn't so dark in the shower. I will be purchasing another one for my downstairs basement when that gets remodeled."
2,Rusty Grommets,Well I have had this for about a month now and the grommets are rusty already. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Flimsy,"This liner is flimsy compared to the ones that I usually buy at a large retail bed & bath store. I prefer the heavier fabric liners that I usually use.Also, it doesn't include the plastic suction cups that secure the liner to the shower walls. My usual shower curtain has two little plastic suction cups on either end, to keep the liner in place. The first few times I used this Croscill liner, I ended up with water all over my bathroom floor!Next time, instead of being lazy and ordering online, I will go to the store and buy myself a quality fabric shower curtain liner. This one is no good."
5,Great Product,"This fabric shower curtain liner is everything I had hoped it would be. Very nice quality, and works like a charm."
4,Nice curtain,I like it. It's nice to have the fabric because it looks/feels fancier than plastic. It really does work well and is waterproof.
5,Good Quality,"Have been using this fabric shower about 8 months now, washed many times and still good conditions. Worth for the money."
5,"Try this, you'll love it!","We've owned several fabric shower liners in the past and been disappointed with them for a variety of reasons.This Croscill liner is by far the best we've ever used! It lets a perfect amount of light through and is super-easy to clean. The only irritating thing, which is common to every liner in the world, is having to hang it up and take it down to launder it! ;)If you've never tried a fabric liner, make this bargain-priced item your first choice! Recommended without reservation! :)"
1,This item is NOT as described!!!!,"This item does NOT have leaded beads on the bottom of the hem so if does not stay ""flat"". It goes all over the place. I am highly disappointed."
2,Rusting after only a month!,"The metal eyelets on the liner are beginning to rust, and it's only been up for a month. I thought it was otherwise excellent. The fabric is good quality and the color is very consistent with the pictures on the site. Sadly, I guess I'm going to be replacing it sooner than I'd hoped because of the metal eyelets. I thought about hitting them with some WD-40 and then trying to protect them somehow, but then I realized this is a $10 shower curtain liner and probably isn't worth the hassle."
5,great value,"Wonderful liner that I use alone as a shower curtain. As long as you have good shower rod hooks, you'll have no problems with this item."
5,great quality,I purchased this as a gift to go with a shower curtain & rings. The quality appears to be outstanding and I liked the subtle design. My daughter was very happy with the selection.
4,Small Grommets,This shower curtain is great. My only complaint is that the grommets are small thus restricting me from using a certain set of shower hooks that have decorative ball on the end. I just switched to a set of hooks that were straight on the end that hooks over the rod. It is fine.
4,A Pleasant Surprise,This was my first linen curtain after years of vinyl or plastic. What a pleasant surprise. It allows more light into the shower than a normal curtain. Linen looks pretty darn good too.Curtain is water-resistant and handles showers well. It is not water-proof though. Direct spray on the curtain for more than a few seconds will seep through to the other side.I dig the extra light. Curtain is long and wide. It will easily cover standard tubs.Very happy with result. Highly recommend.
4,Great price and looks good,Serves it's purpose. Looks great and a much better option than plastic. Its simple looking but is a bit darker than in the pictures. More of an off-white which was a surprise but still looks great.
2,"Doesn't make noise, hangs well, but molds like all the others!","I thought this curtain was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but within 9 months, the bottom was covered in mold/mildew. It is NOT a miracle product as reviewed and caused me to buy it, but performs better than other liners for the price that I have used."
4,Nice and Soft...almost kind of sleek,"I bought them to have a spare set in the house, for guests and laundry pile up days. Well, they are too good for any of my guests. They are very nice to put my face against, and believe you me, I have put my face against one too many things!"
3,Not what I was expecting,I got the correct kind of headset but it was not the color I wanted or the color it said it was going to be. The product works ok...I know now to look for a better quality and not pick the product by the color...even though I didn't get the right color.
3,Interesting but too repetitive,"I enjoyed the hustle and bustle of this poetic novel, but a lot must have been lost in translation, because I don't personally feel that repetition always leads to a demonstration of the power of language. Often, it can do the opposite. The most interesting part of the book for me was the last section, in which the author tries to imitate Marquez, with some hilarious results. It reminded me of the coal miner's skit from Monty Python's Flying Circus. The collection is exuberant, but disjointed, since it is actually 5 shorter works all put into this one volume. Interesting, and I am glad I read it, but I don't think I will be trying any more of her work."
2,Wha?,"Perhaps I am an uncultured swine but I could not get through this, nor did I particularly want to. This book was not for me."
5,Doss's Utes,The Charlie Moon Series by James D. Doss never fails to please. Aunt Daisy is quite a character. It's as close to putting on a favorite pair of old bluejeans and getting comfortable as you can get. I always learn something new about Indian culture while the mysteries keep me reading and reading. The characters seem to live and breathe.
3,Shadow Man,This is my first book by James Doss. Not particularly impressed. Probably will not order any more in that series.Patches
4,Two or One,"Aunt Daisy, please take the big jug-head and shake him. Have long been a fan, but this one pushes the boundaries of the shamanistic. You have a strong streak of practical reality that Charlie lacks as he flounders as a rancher away from his spiritual home. It is time for Charlie to go back to the reservation and his roots.A woman's death from a rifle bullet has repercussions. A dentist who insists the shot was meant for him hires Charlie, but is proven correct before Charlie can discover the killer. Aunt Daisy's home is destroyed, which has Charlie searching for clues in all the wrong places.The sly humor of Doss makes you laugh out loud, much better than DEAD SOUL.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,Background Needed For This Book,"One should have considerable background in Eastern mind and body work; as well as lay reading in quantum consciousness theory. Given that, there are good expositions and theories (with the clearest diagrams I have seen)on the subject of quantum healing. Not for the uninformed or the New Age skeptic. Once I got past some of the ""jargon"" I got a much clearer idea of what the author's presentations of the concept of ""collapsing consciousness"" of the body in the same way observation of quantum collapse in particle theory occurs in quantum physics. This is pretty much cutting edge new age thinking. A fascinating area of inquiry (the mind/brain quantum generator idea) and one on which a lot more is to said/tested/explained."
5,Fascinating read,A lot of things make more sense after reading this book. I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for better answers to difficult medical questions.
4,Careful and intelligent description of science and spirituality. Beautiful writer. Part of my quest.,"The concepts are mind blowing from classical physics, but presentation conservative and reasonable.This is where the best minds are going, but the difficulty is mine. Thseries of books that deal with these conclusions from quantum physics will develop the major thrust of Religion in this new century.This all started a hundred years ago and is just now starting to blend into the conversation.weymouth fogelberg"
2,This book could use some healing itself ...,"I'm a physicist during the day, but one of those guys who believes that a science can at some point find common ground with spirituality.Eventually.But this is not the book for it. First, Goswami is not what you would call a gifted writer, and let's face it, this is one case where you can't just toss a bunch of words together. He centers the action on himself, and writes more to get you to believe him as a teacher, and then ""authoritatively"" put forth a bunch of propositions, rather than drawing you into a convincing argument.Hats off to the effort, but it sort of falls short from both directions. Scientists are NOT going to be convinced by his arguments (it's certainly not but together in that fashion), but correspondingly, experienced energy healers aren't going to learn much about physics, or the natural world from that viewpoint, either.The title's great ... but it's sort of downhill from there."
5,Speedy delivery,"I was thrilled to get the book I ordered so quickly! I ordered it and the next day, it was delivered. I needed the book for a class. That's why I use Amazon!"
5,Great and priceless graces are waiting in this book,"Those who have faith shall receive great and priceless graces if they read about these dreams especially: The Snake and The Rosary, A Pack of Monsters and The Two Columns in The Sea and make use of graces God shall give them after the reading.What a book for what a price! The same holds true for ""AA-1025""."
2,you send me somthing that does not fit!,i purchused this item for a 2002 ford explorer xlt and the item did not fit! I did check the see if this fit your vehicle and it said yes it do!! Now i am stuck with this product. i live in the Bahamas and its no way to return this!! This really sucks!! Thanks for nothing!
2,Doesn't do the book justice,"I was deeply disappointed in this video especially because all the other reviews were 5 stars. The acting and make-up left alot to be desired. The Ruby Princess sang well, but others in the cast did not. My husband left the room because he found it so nauseating. My 9 year old daughter seemed to enjoyed it, but fast forwarded through most of the musical numbers. She said that the video did not give as much background on the story as she would have liked. The story taught a good lesson and did not contain anything offensive or controversial, but I don't this makes up for the poor quality of the production. In the future we'll stick to the books and let her imagination draw the pictures. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Looked better online than it actually was,"I recently bought and assembled this puzzle, but I was kind of disappointed with my purchase.The image of the puzzle looked interesting to me when viewed online, but once I saw the printing quality on the actual pieces, it just wasn't as good. I'm sure the original painting is nice, but the way it turns out as a puzzle is pretty poor.Additionally, the pieces were also very generic, with most of them pretty similar. I like a puzzle where even the pieces create a challenge, and this didn't do it for me. Also, some of them had to be torn apart to begin with, so the actual cutting of the puzzle wasn't done well.It was not the worst puzzle ever, but it was just not as good as I'd hoped it would be. Overall, I would say it's just ok, but I wouldn't really recommend it."
2,Poor quality,"I was very dissapointed when I watched this movie. Both, video and audio quality are not the best. It seems like whoever has made this ""legal"" copies of Rocio Durcal's movies is taking advantage of the demand of them after her untimely death. ""Las Leandras"", ""La Cenicienta del Barrio"" and ""Cristina Guzman"" (movies) have the same problems and they are only worth purchasing it if you were/are a hard core fan of Ms. Durcal and her early years."
3,Star Wars Droids,Thought this would be fun for my son but it was so boring he lost interest so quickly. Not a good movie. Glad I only paid $6.00 for it.
3,Droids 'R' Fun!,"For fans of R2-D2 and C3PO, the loveable droids from the Star Wars trilogy, this is the thing for you! Whether you are old enough to remember enjoying these classic cartoons, or just now getting into the wonder of the Saga, you can do no wrong in picking this up and joining the droids as they have their adventures away from Luke Skywalker and the rest of the rebels! Your kids will love it!"
4,Finally on DVD,"I'm not sure if the other reviewers have watched Droids recently but the episodes were actually made in story arcs with 3 or 4 episodes making up one large story. Ewoks was more episodic in nature and you could watch them out of order and not miss anything. So I don't see what their beef is with putting them together to make a movie, it makes sense.As long as all the episodes are put out on DVD I will be happy I can stop watching my poorly encoded video files."
4,So what if it's a cheap rip off.......,"It's still the same cartoon I watched as a ""Star Wars"" loving youngster. I understand why people are mad about it not being the complete series. That would have been cooler. But, hey. This is way better then nothing at all. I would have loved to seen the Boba Fett episode. I was miffed when I watched the whole thing and he was nowhere to be seen. Oh well. This should still be in any ""Star Wars"" fans DVD collection. The Droids rock!!"
1,Rip-Off!!!!,"I used to love this cartoon when I was a kid so I was very excited to se it on the shelf last Tuesday.After having just watched it now, I want my money back!I mainly bought this for the fabulous ""In Trouble Again"" theme, but it is MISSING! As are most of the episodes.Why does Lucas like to screw over fans so much?Has he gotten so fat that blood no longer flows to his brain? What a pig."
4,Dear fans,"Hello Fellow Star Wars fans. I purchased a copy of Droids myself (mainly because C-3PO and R2-D2 are my favorite characters). Yes I know it's a bunch of episodes put together to make two feature films, but be thankful George Lucas bothered to put it on dvd. If we were able to, we can march to Skywalker Ranch and protest Mr. Lucas to actually putting the entire series on dvd (including the Great Heap episode).May the Force be with you."
1,Plays like an old Bruce Lee Kung Fu movie,"I also was a huge fan in the 70s and 80s. I bought this dvd for my kids to introduce them to some of the greatest characters and stories in SF movie land. What a disappointment. It plays like an old Bruce Lee Kung Fu movie. The dialog is disjointed, rushed, and difficult to follow. The scenes are one jam-packed action event after another. I felt like it was running at 125% fast forward. They attempt to incorporate extra information in the dialog to tie the stories together and it sounds like a rushed blathering with a confusing jumble of space ships taking off and landing, characters running here and there, getting captured and escaping, and good guys and bad guys changing sides like flipping pancakes."
3,This cartoon isn't that good but little kids will like it,These episodes arn't that good. I use to have them on vhs but these are boring! Don't get me wrong I like star wars and c3po and r2d2 but this was stupid. But don't worry little kids will like it.
1,WHAT THE %^&*!!!,Is this supposed to be star wars related all this is a movie were we watch C-3PO suffer R2-D2 bleep like ozzy ozborne it has nothing to do with star wars nothing!Its like a telletubie version of star wars on the cover of the box look at the Tie fighters they look nothing like Tie fighters.this is 5year old and lower if your over 5 and waching this you should be put in a mentell home.Thank you very much
2,A major disappointment,"When I was younger I actually remembered watching this show on TV. I was big into star wars at the time and even though the music was sort of cheesy, I loved it. Naturally I purchased it the moment I saw it in stores only to be hugely disappointed. They had completely redone the music including that great TV opening theme that I loved. I then immediately grumbled at the $10 I wasted on it and then gave it to my friend's kid.As for the animation, it was targeted for kids so do keep this in mind as you view it. As adults you will find the animation to be simplistic, but your kids if they are into Star Wars will love it. As for me a fan of the original, it was a huge letdown."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD,"The droids cartoon in the 1980's ran for 13 episodes (along with the Ewoks) and had a prime time special called The Great Heep. This IS NOT it. This is the same kick in the teeth they pulled with VHS. They put four or five episodes together and call it a droids movie. If you want the best release of droids (or Ewoks) look for the old tapes from the early 90's that show only two episodes back to back. Even this was really lacking, but you got to see the droids with original credits and music. Why can't they ever do it right?"
4,First read.,"I have never read the manuscript of A Christmas Carol, so I wanted to give it a go. So far it's not bad."
2,"Worth $10 not $40, small and difficult to read","Wow was this a disappointment. The pictures make it look as though this is a large bound book with fantastic drawings and handwritten notes from Dickens. It is not! This is a tiny, tiny book with tiny print and unreadable notes and drawings. I might have been happy to buy this for $10 but $40 is outrageous! It will be returned immediatly!"
4,The Orginal,"I wanted to read the orginal Christmas Story to see how it compared to the movies and plays that have been made from it. Sometimes interesting seeing what changes they have made to the story to make the ghosts able to be played by people. The ghost of Christmas Future is much more scary in the story, but he does not seem to be Death as they have shown him in the movies."
3,Disappointing reproduction,"I love the work of Charles Dickens and A Christmas Carol is a particular favorite of mine so I immediately ordered this book. I was very disappointed with the size and quality of the reproductions of the original manuscript. The reproductions are small and so unclear as to be almost illegible. The reproductions of the illustrations are similarly poor and reproduced only in black & white inside (they are reproduced in color, slightly larger than postage stamps, on the front and back cover. Best thing about this expensive book is the typed transcript of the manuscript facsimile. The book is strictly for the most ardent of collectors of Dickens and A Christmas Carol in particular."
5,Spookily good,"Brilliant story, brilliantly told. I found A Christmas Carol far easier and more enjoyable than Charles Dickens's more rambling, heavyweight novels. Should have read this 20 years ago."
2,Images of Dickens's handwriting are illegible,"I got this for a family member who is a huge Dickens fan, wooed by having his handwritten comments shown in tandem with a printed version. To be honest, I'd seen a similar book online at a ""high end"" retailer and came over to Amazon to see if the same thing was available cheaper-- sure enough this book undercuts the other one by $20 plus shipping but there is no comparison in quality. I ended up returning this one and paying more for the other one, and that would be my recommendation for someone looking to get one like this."
3,Good Shredder but jams,"I've had this shredder for about four years. I use it in a small office and shred a couple times a week. Overall, it has been robust and I have gotten my money out of it but the design of the outfeed (into the basket) causes it to jam frequently. It only takes 30 seconds to clear the jam but it is messy and annoying. I would look for a shredder that feeds directly to the basket instead of having a 2"" channel to feed down."
5,Unique and strangely familiar,"I just received this book a few days ago I could not put it down. I will not give away any of the plot because I feel this would be spoiling a great literary work but I must say that I have never read any other book as inventive as this. It is strange, magical, familiar and melancholic. Sadness and heartbreak is woven throughout this book having the ability to bring back feelings of loss and a failed relationship which is bittersweet, bitter because it evokes my own memories of past love and sweet because I have read a book that has the ability to do draw these feelings from me. Salvador Plascencia, you are amazing!Great book!"
5,THE most interestinly written book I've ever read - AMAZING!,"This book is like no other book I've ever read. This book will pull you in and play with your mind. I love it. If you are looking to read a very non-standard book, this is it. Like another one of the reviews says, I can't say too much about the book because it will ruin the story.Do yourself a favor and read this book NOW. It's the most original book you will ever read and ENJOY.It's the only book that I've ever started reading a second time IMMEDIATELY after I finished reading it the first time. All in all, I read it twice in 3 days."
5,Storytelling about storytelling,"This, in some sense, is storytelling about storytelling, and the result is absolutely lovely--I can't say much more than that without feeling liking I'm giving too much away.I will, however, leave you with two things:(1) At one point in the novel, The People of Paper is described as ""the war on omniscient narration (a.k.a. the war against the commodification of sadness)"" which I thought was fitting.(2) It takes some of the modern style (that others would call ""gimmicks"") employed by the likes of Dave Eggers inA Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Geniusand Jonathan Safran Foer inExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close (Movie Tie-In): A Novelto a whole new level. If you thought those were gimmicky, avoid this altogether."
2,El Salvador,"The prologue of this book is exquisite. The fallability of humans is delicately expressed though the use of origami-doctors and priests who build people. Unfortunately, the inventiveness of Plascencia grows beyond endearing as the chapters move on. It becomes unbearable. The story is lost in script-like repetition and hastily placed ink splotches. While Plascencia may have had good reason behind his innovation, creativity hits a reader like a bat to the head and leaves them with no time to contemplate who threw the bat or why the bad was thrown before they pass out and puke over their new shoes."
1,These stink!,"I got 5 different ones plus the tv thing for our kids. (Yes, I have six kids.) It's not even a week after xmas and none of them will play with it. To much work. You spent the better part of an hour digging for various items, money being the most important and then have to take your money to the store to buy things,like FOOD, feed the pet just to have the pet still be hungry. What a pain the the behind!! Even the oldest won't do it!! And I'm an adult! We are taking ours back for a full refund!"
1,Package problems,"The mug arrived in a speedy manner, but was poorly packaged. There was absolutely no padding around the mug itself. Just around it's box! So, of course, it arrived broken. I really wanted the mug...but, I sure won't be shopping here again, because I don't trust that the next item will be packaged properly and I will have to fight with this all over again."
3,not too thrilled,"I was looking for good lyric exercise pants. There are, but they aren't. They are better suited for wear under jeans in winter. Didn't care the material. Was too hot for execise, didn't provide lyric streamline feel."
3,Not as good,This book is not nearly as good as the others I have purchased. Although it has many illustrations the language in the book does not clearly explain how to tell the difference between real and fake. It's more for professionals.
3,"Cool, mostly comfortable, but smelly.","These stay cool and have no noticeable sweat build-up problems. The toe ridge is a little irritating, at first, but the slides are otherwise comfortable.I would give these 4 or 5 stars except for one thing; They smell! Out of all my footwear, these develop quite a funk. Washing them in detergent and then bleach only helps for an hour or two. Note that I alternate footwear; never wearing the same shoes, boots, sandals, slides, or flip-flops twice in a row. The drying out time does not help with the odor either. It looks like the ridges, pores, and fabric are trapping oils and skin cells in a very bacteria-friendly way. The muck is away from your feet but doesn't seem to wash out."
5,just what she wanted,"They have a boy; they're having a girl. Daddy has gone butterfly mad, and the blanket is just the thing to welcome baby girl home."
5,Super Handy Reference Book,"I use this great little book daily. I add quotes to my emails, sales copy and any other documents I work on. There always seems to be something that applies just perfectly. Also provides a quick break from work and brings a smile. I have given to many friends and family and they agree!"
1,This book is one big ad for the author's products,"I was very disappointed in this book. Although there are many worthwhile quotes in the book, I find it quite annoying to see ads in bold print for the author's website on every page. This seems so unprofessional and is very distracting."
3,big big world,I was disappointed with the dvd because the actual tv show plays 3 regular songs througout each episode and the DVD cuts these songs out. I purchased the DVD for the sole reason of having these songs available because this is what my child enjoys.
5,zurich time watch winder,could not belive the quality when i opend the box. this is just what the product description explains. verry happy with my choice on this product..
5,Great for the price!,This little book comes in handy and covers all the majors in respiratory. If your looking for something short and concise that you can refer to on occasion look no further.
5,Great Quick Resource,"This is my favorite book out of all my multiple RT school books. It's not on our list of required reading, but I think it should be!The book has references for almost everything, information on medication, PFT and Vent information, and even ACLS algorithms.Sure it doesn't go into any great detail (not likeEgan's Fundamentals of Respiratory CareorEssentials of Respiratory Care) but as a handy little reference to keep in your scrub pocket or in your locker it really can't be beat.If you are an RT this is a great book to have, and if you know an RT it is a great little gift."
1,"Love the book, hate the condition it is in.","The book is great for any RT, problem is, it is heavily used, in fact, the words are worn off. I expected a new book. I guess I learned my lesson, will not be buying from here again."
3,A disappointment,I was surprised and disappointed that Mgr. Knox employed such old fashioned diction and grammar in his translation. He was such an excellent stylist that I had looked forward to a very clear and graceful text.
4,Good general intro to medieval christian beliefs & practices,"The book does not assume a great knowledge of Catholic beliefs, practices and history, although it is written in a scholarly style, and is aimed at University level readers. Within the class of textbooks, it is an easy read, and full of fascinating titbits. Did you know that there were Catholics in China in the 13th century? The book does contain some church history, but is more interested in the beliefs and practices of ordinary people, and their interaction with the church. Highly recommended especially to people interested in everyday medieval life."
4,A platonist speaks out,"According to Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose is a Platonist, who believes there is a unique world of ideas that describes physical reality. I think it is a good thing that someone actually believes Plato was right all the way and makes the case for it concerning Relativity, Quantum Gravity and Consciousness. So, as inspiration I found the book a good read - But I don't particular believe all of Penroses arguments. Especially the part about that our brains can't be modeled by computational systems and hence that strong artificial intelligence will remain in science fiction was to me unconvincing.-Simon"
1,Incredibly Weak,"When I received the first edition of this book in the mail, I already had read Men, Masculinity and Media, edited by Steve Craig (Sage Publications) and was expecting more of the same. Imagine my surprise when this book arrived; it was written by a community college professor at about a high school level of language and sophistication. The only useful OR interesting parts were the verbatim reactions of typical women to various ""sexy"" magazine ads featuring men. The rest of the book was pretty much useless. It is absolutely astonishing that the publisher has enough courage to release a new edition."
1,Primary school writing skill,Incredible! I really couldn't believe that something like this has been written by the person who is university professor. But this book is very important for understanding today's Serbian politics. Milosevic's sadness is quite normal for someone who's sharing a bed with Mrs. Markovic.
1,This book is an incradible trash,A review given by the reader from Berlin on oct 22 1998 is what is on the hearts of thousands of people in Serbia. God save us from this woman!
3,Enlightening and Horrifying,"I found this absolutely frightening. It was, on the one hand a very interesting look into the ideology of a woman who has had a hand in one of the most tragic events in recent history and in that way it has helped me to further my understanding of the thought processes and attitudes behind that event. On the other hand I was made almost physically ill as I read, horrified that a person in such a position of authority (ie. a univeristy professor and the wife of a man as powerful as Milosevic) could hold such ideas and such a rigid approach to the world. Worth the read but keep recent history in mind."
3,Good practice paper,"I received my paper and ripped open the pack so I could start folding. I was immediately disappointed by the selection of colors. The colors themselves are good enough, however they are boring. They make your creations uninteresting and drab. I prefer patterned color paper. The paper performs well and I recommend this paper for practicing because if you mess up you didn't lose all that much."
1,Origami paper not worth it,"The description of the Origame paper says 6 colors includes Gold foil, 49 sheets of 6 3/4 x 6 3/4 paper. This makes you think there are equal number of colors in the set, but in fact you get only 1 gold foil sheet.I am very disappointed in this product and I will never order this product or any product by this company."
2,"Very good film, but I don't like that this divided into 2 discs","Very good presentation, and very good picture quality and soundBut the 3d disk I found unnecessary division on 2 disks"
3,Chetze v chetze Hebrew video,"Well done video for kids, but the language portions are a bit off in places.In one instance, the item shown is not what is spoken.Also, the tape uses transliteration of Hebrew, not Hebrew letters. Both should be used."
2,Too many changes,"It really is pretty hard trying to pull off a meaningful tribute to Jimi Hendrix because the man did simply too many awesome things with the guitar to be matched by anyone. That being said the album does try and go after the Hendrix sound whcih is a respected trait for it but I was not really that impressed. The album has some good to it but too much changes to his great hits was not needed. In my opinion the only song that does close to any justice to Hendrix's great legacy would be Stevie Ray Vaughn's version of ""Little Wing"" other than the songs have too many changes in them for my liking."
5,Spiritual Tale of Lost and Found,"Marcyle Taliaferro has crafted a lovely novel that will pluck at your heartstrings. ""Fountains of the Spirits"" is a spiritual tale of lost and found. As a young woman tries to come to terms with her past and searches for her future, a stubborn young man angrily questions his beliefs. When their paths cross and lives become intertwined, we witness the struggle for answers and guidance.The book is well written from beginning to end. Ms. Taliaferro artfully weaves a message of hope and inspiration. The author is obviously well acquainted with animals, namely horses and dogs. Her knowledgeable insight reminds us of the role animals play in helping people connect with one another, the natural ability they possess which often brings out the best in humans.""Fountains of the Spirits"" is a story to be savored for its simplicity and truth. I highly recommend adding this book to your permanent library, as you will want to read it again and again."
2,Inferior Jukebox material - completists only,"Although my favorite King recordings are from the 50s, this is very dispensible material. It's the throw-away jukebox recordings all black recording stars seem to have been obliged to do at some stage.Although the big band is punchy, the songs are uniformly poor, with King sounding foolish singing about teenage themes and school girls. The arrangements are often tastless, and worst of all, King's guitar sound is bad. He sounds like someone just starting out, not the veteran he already was by that time.The nadir is a pop song based on the ""Kumbyah"" theme, which is not only bad in its own right, but incompetently arranged as well."
4,"Young, Juicy, Naive and Perverse","Funny to find a book I wrote and published in 1976 and that was practically only sold by myself to people I knew can be found in 2004 on Amazon.com. How has it arrived there? I wonder. Who is selling it? I wonder too. This book of poetry was a deep dive into the mind of a teenager who was discovering both sex and politics, his body and his society. Enjoy it if you can read French of course.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
5,Super smooth,"I installed a Johnson pocket door kit and bought these ball bearing rollers as an upgrade. They increase the door weight capacity of the pocket door system to 200 pounds, which I didn't need - I just wanted the smoothest operating pocket door possible.I was not disappointed. The entire pocket door system was easy to install, and with these parts, it simply could not work any better."
4,Buena Produccion,"Realmente una buena produccion y una de sus mejores a el lado de ""Con Amor Se Gana,"" ""No Me Compares,"" y ""Lo Que Llevo Por Dentro."" La mejor cancion de el disco es ""Lento,"" por sus bellos arreglos y letras. La voz de Frankie sonaba mejor que sono en el disco ""Inesperado."" Otras buenas canciones incluyen ""Todo Es Mentira,"" ""Tu Voz,"" el titulo de el disco ""Amanecer Contigo,"" ""Venus De Abril,"" ""Lloro Por Ti,"" ""Juremonos,"" y ""No Renionciare."" Todavia le falta un disco excelente, quizas lo logra en su proximo proyecto."
3,Not so thrilled but ...,"Well I actually did not need this kit but as it was on offer for less than $4 and as I was paying shipping for another item from this supplier, I ordered both. But I feel the wire gauge is not sufficient to power a car amp."
5,A book expressing on the life of a young refugee of the war,It is a touching novel like the ones before and after it. You have to read A Gathering of Pearls to complete the set. The title of the book matches very well with its story. The set of books let you relieve a war and its affect on one family and kid. I recommend it for a reading project or anything for history.
2,In the WRONG KEYS.,"I love the history and the pictures in this book about Judy, but I wanted it for practical purposes. The authors of the book could have taken a day or two to transpose these songs into Judy's keys, but instead EVERYONE who buys the book has to do that themselves. Think of all the duplicate hours of transcription.I bought this book so I would NOT have to pay someone to transcribe these songs. Now I may have to pay someone to transpose them. I am very disappointed."
5,"My Favorite Ring, Ever","I bought this ring once before, but I lost it. I loved it so much I ordered it again, but this one has a few changes. My older one had a flat band at the bottom, but this one is a perfect circle. The band is also a bit thinner. The cross itself looks more defined, however, and I think it's an improvement. I have bought other items from Dan Jewelers and they always ship quick. Definitely pick this up."
3,"""Play Dirty""","Not Michael's best, I found it a little confusing. The mission seemed to be a waste of time. May be it was supposed to be, but I couldn't see why. Good desert scenes, more real than many. Good interpretation of desert warfare generally."
2,WWII film made in the anti-war Sixties has disappointing ending,"The best thing about this film is Michael Caine's performance, but if you know Caine's film history, he's been in some clunkers. As the other reviews allude to, this is a pseudo ""Dirty Dozen"" clone. The plot's pretty unimaginative, with the greatest disappointment being the ending, but considering it the anti-war era when the film was made, not unexpected. You'll wince when you see a character attempting to return to Allied lines wearing a German officer's uniform, which is incredibly stupid, considering that, with the simple expedient of removing the jacket, the German army desert uniform of this period looks substantially like the Allied uniform. No eye-candy in the way of period aircraft or vehicles, so I can't even recommend it for that reason. Skip this one, or don't say you weren't warned."
3,"A ""Noir"" WAR MOVIE","with all the accouterments of a Film Noir flick, ""Play Dirty"", rolls along to its ""Noir style"" ending. Players make good decisions, bad decisons, testosterone based decisions, prejudiced decisions, and gain some nobility and affability as they survive the challenges of a botched suicide mission. Rival intelligence officers set competing missions loose to destroy a german fuel dump in the North African desert during WWII. One group, ""Dirtier than the Dirty Dozen"", nominally led by Michael Caine, sets off behind german lines with bare minimum equipment, while the other fully manned and well equipped follows close behind. With treachery, openly hostile groups and intra group conflict threatening the mission and michael caine every step of the way, they hit a ""noir"" spot in the mission, take a ""noir"" turn then a short jog to the ""noir"" ending. if you like film noir and war movies you'll like this one."
5,Dirtier Than The Dozen,"Here's another underated Caine winner. He's a nice-guy engineer leading a band of criminals through the desert to blow up Rommel's fuel supplies. These guys aren't the leering whackos or lovable losers of The Dirty Dozen, they're clear-eyed, ice cold [...]. The whole picture is informed with a brutal, anti-heroic take on ""The Good War"" that goes beyond mere hip 60s cynicism.There are a couple of great set pieces, one's a tense minefield in an oasis and earlier there's a drawn out sequence of hauling trucks up a rocky clift that's like Wages of Fear in the desert and it's sensational. (There's also the inclusion of the gay Middle Eastern members of the team that is shown without a trace of comedy or sterotyping.)Also, note the image of the scorpion being taunted in the ring of fire that would essentially be swiped by Peckinpah for the next year's Wild Bunch."
1,great music great trumpeter bad sound restoration,Many people who love and admire this music of the 20's and 30's undoubtedly must have respect for the sounds that were produced by these artists. Having to record without the existence of tape certainly had to be an obsticle. But when a label who doesn't love or have any respect for natural sound at all: puts out a product that sounds like it's being played by a loud speaker wrapped in felt and 20 thousand leagues under the sea says more about the state of their mind. It is a diservice to all practicioners of great heart-felt music.
5,TOP HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY,"BROWN AND YALE'S PELIKAN ARE AMERICA'S TOP SCHOLARS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EARLY-MIDDLE CHURCH'S CHRISTOLOGY. READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, BALANCED, AND BROADMINDED."
3,"X-Spot, a new name for an already-known area.","Although this book does offer useful information, I bought it thinking that it had uncovered some all-new spot. This is purely a cervix book."
1,Nutone WS130WW,It would be nice if I had the product delivered so that I could review it. I ordered it 2 months ago and have not received it yet.
4,"Happy with my book, but not the shipment tracking","I am very happy with the product! It is like brand new! The price was perfect. Only downside was the shipping info, I didn't get tracking information and was told it would be here in a 3 week time window. Not sure if the seller has anything to do with that though. But I am very happy with the book I got from them. I would defintily recommend buying from this seller since the book was in such excellent condition."
5,Perfect timing...great information,"With the Enron accounting troubles one of the top stories in the media today, this book couldn't have come at a better time. The book explains everything you need to know about financial statement anlalysis. No matter who you are, or where you work, or what your position, this book explains it all. Executives, employees, and investors should all know the ""numbers game."" What you don't know can hurt you--just look at how many lives have been hurt by what is taking place at Enron."
1,Alternative view: Big Disappointment,"I ordered this book based on the positive Amazon reviews,but it is a major disappointment. The authors belaborthe obvious. Their major points would not be a surprise toanyone with minimal coursework in accounting, with cursoryexperience looking at financial statements, or anyone whohas spent a little time watching CNBC. The redundancyis mind-numbing. Maybe hormone crazed undergraduates needto see the same points over and over again, but intelligentand attentive readers shouln't have to waste their time.Enron does not even make it into the index, nor could Ifind any of their financial smoke-screens mentioned in thetext. I would never spend another dime on work by theseauthors, ..."
2,you are not likely to learn anything knew from this book,This book is not likely to tell you anything that you don't know already from reading the newspapers. The authors wrote in the introduction that it requires advanced knowledge of finance and accounting to comprehend the material. Nothing like that. A couple of basic accounting courses are all you need to read it. It is redundant. It didn't tell me anything new although if I were a sophomore in college then maybe I would have learned something. Don't expect to get any insight into the financial numbers game. It is a little more than a basic review of current accounting issues. If you read business publications from time to time then you are already well familiar with everything the book has to say.
4,Excellent book,"An excellent book. Very useful and clear. It is easy to understand, some things are out of date but the majority of things still apply. I love the fact that there are real life examples from companies that have played the Financial Numbers game"
4,Frustrating but valuable,"Mulford and Comiskey badly need an editor, clear-sighted and heartless. There is a wonderful book here, but it is maddeningly difficult to extract from the text as presented -- ill-organized and repetitive and in coverage, perhaps even haphazard (another reviewer note that they don't cover reserves -- true, and I wonder if this is simply an oversight?). That said, this remains the best introduction that I've seen to games managers play (and in which accountants cooperate). More extensive (and less jaunty) than Howard Schilit (Financial Shenanigans). For broader coverage on the limits of accounting, move on to Eccles, etc., ""The ValueReporting (sic) Revolution."" After the dust settles from the Enron imbroglio, M&C will surely want to do a new edition: here's hoping they keep the same wonderful content, with better focus and analysis."
3,Financial Numbers Game,"The book is fine for those not informed on the topic of financial reports, but those that have some insight on that topic would find it boring and not as informative as expected.I also found several issues repeated, and other topics just to vague to be of much use."
4,Not what I expected.,"Well. First off, these are not your traditional romance-book vampires. Oh yes, here we have a brooding ""Oh I'm such an unnatural horror, I don't dare touch her purity"" man, issue one; but the damnation in question is taken in a literal sense, with no doubt of the reality of a soul, or of God and heaven and hell and the place in all this of a vampire. These are topics that most romance books shy away from for fear of upsetting the story. This one includes them integrally.So... not what I expected, but the first story is very lyrical and lovely. The second starts out more clumsily when you step straight to it from the first."
4,Out of the Shadows,This is a good read. Not a typical vampire thriller. The vampires sleep alot and I did get tired of reading about sleep overcoming them but the stories kept you turning the pages. Interesting characters and so are their histories. I would recommend this book.
3,Reruns aren't only on tv,"Once again the Stories of Aidan,and Maeve Tremayn When they were first Printed I read them and I'm still of the same opinion. The story of Aidan seems to be over done He was made a vampire and didn't want to be one, so does his best to become human Then he falls in love with a mortal(yawn)! The best of the two is the story of Maeve. She enjoys being a vampire and she falls in love with a mortal,but she turned him into a vampire with the help of another vampire who had watched over her twin Aidan. It is a Good book in some areas. On average I guess. Since both stories are in this book you could just skip Forever and the Night and you would be happy."
5,Great Resource for Pet Owners Who Need Information,"After my dog was diagnosed with cancer, I searched the internet for answers, and found this book on Amazon. It is a little book, worth it's weight in gold. It is written by a knowledgeable vet who translates clinical information into a factual, yet compassionate conversation with the reader. By using the website links in the back of the book, I was able to find a world class animal hospital in my area that correctly diagnosed the rare form of cancer my dog has. Seven months later, we are on the road to remission. I still refer to Dr. Downing's book, and am more than thanful to have found it."
4,Excellent camera,The video quality of this camera is excellent. The only issues I have with the camera is the main control switch which is very uncomfortable and constraint of recording time by buttery.
2,HDMI not working,"I brought this camera in mid July. The pictures are great compare to other HD camera. Component connections, AV connections are workingbut when I tried to hook up with my DVI it's not work!This DVI in my HDTV is currently using with my DVD player and has no problem. I called Panasonic and after about an hour of diagnostic, theyasked me to send back in. When I asked if they have a tracing number,they said no (which meant that after I sent it to them, I may never see it again).I returned it to Amazon with $20.00 insured postage (ouch!). Amazon saidthey would refund this postage, but never did."
5,A new paradigm for camcorders.,"I have been using this little jewel for about 2 weeks and my early impressions are all favorable. The size is perfect, i.e. small but not too small and buttons are well located. The screen is big and beautiful and recordings themselves are stunning. Haven't messed with the software (waiting for iMovie to support AVCHD) but everything else is logical and easy. Recording to SD cards is the best of all worlds: instant non-linear access to videos, easy to add capacity, small and light, tougher than a hard drive camcorder. Can you tell I love it?"
1,Chronic,"Some reviewers go on about what a great laugh this is.Sorry, but if you want a laugh watch Seinfeld or something.Horror should be horror, and this feeble excuse for a horror film doesn't cut the mustard.It's absolute rubbish of the first order. Bad acting, bad direction, cr@p story.............and if you are watching it to see a famous old horror starlet don't bother. She acts like a wardrobe in this and looks about 150 years old.AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE"
3,Not too bad. Not enough gore.,"This movie started off pretty bad, looking like a homemade porn. It changed and started looking pretty good. The story line was pretty good. The characters got killed off too quickly and there wasnt enough gore. If you are thinking this would be like the Slumber party massacres or even the Sorority House Massacres, you will be very disappointed but all in all it was a pretty decent movie in its own right."
3,A little better than expected...,"I wasn't expecting too much from this movie. It is a bit better than I expected. There are only a couple of ""that doesn't make any sense"" moments, even when you prepare yourself for a lower budget slasher movie. The dialog is a bit contrived in places, but you can tell the actors and director put effort and heart into this movie. This movie is at least as good as any other movie on late-night cable TV. I would give this movie a 3.5 star rating, if possible."
1,And I wanted to really like this movie....,"I was looking forward to this movie being released since I love the other massacre series movies a lot- especially Slumber Party Massacre. This movie moves at a slow pace to the point where you could fast forward 40 min into the movie and not really miss any action at all except for one killing near the beginning. The movie lacks any type of suspense. Half of the killings happen without the killer ever even being seen at all. The direction and acting were very poorly done. This movie could have been a lot of fun but the majority of the movie is a bunch of people just sitting around talking with no action. The sound quality goes in and out all the time. I am huge fan of B rated horror movies and have seen my share of really good ones and really bad ones. This one happens to be one of the bad ones. If you are curious, check it out but don't expect much at all. 1.5/5"
4,spring break,"Wow, this film had no sex scenes.I'm not dissapointed though. It's a change of pace. It's a cheaply made film clearly but it's actually good. The girls are nice to look at the acting is good enough. I like the idea of who the killer was and his motive. I did not see it coming, as well as the role of the creepy neighbor. The kill scenes were well done and it was a fun experiecne. I liked the film."
5,Koko wa FUN!,"If you've never seen or heard of Koko wa Greenwood (Here is Greenwood) then you're not alone. It's unfortunately not well-known, but it deserves to be. Greenwood is a 6-episode OVA about a particularly crazy boy's dormitory. However, it is more along the shoujo (girl-aimed) line. It's hilarious and fun. Volume 2 covers the making of a movie for the school festival (Here is Devilwood!) and the arrival of a ghost of a teenage girl to haunt one of the boys. Definitely start with volume 1, but if you're looking for something better than the typical so-so anime that is all over, you won't find more of a refreshing change than Greenwood."
4,Home Office,"I keep wearing out my shredders and I just upgraded to this one.Two GREAT features. No more to opening unwanted mail to get at the parts that need shredding. Now - with the 12 page capacity, I just walk from the mail box to the shredder and out it goes.Two - the pull out bin is a major luxury after you've spent a few years emptying the old style units ."
1,Bad experience,After receiving the shredder I threw away the packing and documentation (BIG MISTAKE) and then tried it. The motor binds. I have to reverse-forward it back and forth to get it to work. Wouldn't buy another one.
2,OK but flimsy stand could be better,"Seems to shred OK but the stand and pull out drawer are pretty flexable. This makes it difficult to reinsert the drawer properly without fussing around with it. If it is not in just right, the shredder won't run. I've been using an older model Fellows shredder (until it died) and it was much easier to operate."
1,Not impressed,I paid good money for this item and have been very disapointed.The trigger did not last past the first day before coming apart.I fixed it myself with a cotter key instead of the cheap rivet.The black finish is coming off of the inside of the lid and starting to rust.The handle will not lock in place so you can carry it anymore.The same lock will not catch anymore to loosen the lid for removal or tightning.The hose keeps coming loose at the tank and will not draw right because of the little ferrilthat needs to stay in place.Very disapointed for a sprayer only 9 months old. Do not purchase if you intend on using it much.
2,"Fascinating subject, poor writing","I haven't yet finished this book. The topic is fascinating and somewhat chilling, however, the writing gets in the way.The author presents a wealth of interesting material, but the organization is confused. Much of it reads like a society column squib. Often it is not clear who is being quoted and names are thrown around with abandon.However, it was very enlightening to read about the level of Nazi sympathy that existed in 1930s England, among the upper classes."
2,"Probably OK for routine home useage, but I just replaced it!","I have owned one of these shredders for about a year. I am an individual active realtor working from home and have a lot of things to shred. It has proved to be totally inadequate for my needs. I oil it very often with canola oil (per the instruction manual) at least every time I empty the receptacle bin. But it still jams very frequently. It doesn't handle the listed volume at all. You can only really put 2 or 3 sheets through at a time, and it still jams often. I have gotten the tweezers out for the last time on this shredder! Also, you can't run it for more that about 10 minutes continuously without it shutting itself down for at least 20 minutes to cool down. I just replaced it with the Fellowes C-120C. I just received it today and am really impressed with the difference. The PS80C-2 is probably fine if you don't do much volume. The design is very convenient, and it fits very conveniently under a desk. But be sure to oil it OFTEN!!"
2,"Plastic gears wear off , teeth broke","It worked just fine, wouldn't bite more than 5 sheets! Used about once in a month in the last 3 years and the plastic gear's teeth broke. Just like in the picture posted by other reviewer.Would give another star if they sell the parts like gears at least."
3,No spare parts,"My unit worked great for about a year. Then the corner of the collection bin broke. The unit would not sense the bin and would not work. I was able to stuff s piece of cardboard in the sensor so the unit would work, but it was only a few more months before the bin broke further and shredded paper spilled out.The problem is cheap construction of the storage bin combined with unavailability of parts."
5,AWESOME!,"This shredder is excellent. I had previously used a very cheap strip cut model. I was used to seperating, unfolding, and all sorts of preparation. I generally accumulate paper to be shredded and then it's a job to shred everything that's piled up. I had quite a pile when I bought this shredder, including a couple of credit cards. I fed it stacks and stacks of paper at a time including some staples. Everything went right through and became tiny unrecognizeable confetti. I did not experience any overheating or jamming. I would say that I ran it for 15 minutes or so continuosly. The basket is easy to slide out and empty and you can see the level through the sight window. This is the shredder to get for your home or home office. I wound up getting it at Office Max for the same price as Amazon."
3,"Bad Warranty, Great Scanner","I bought this exact shredder a few years ago. It makes the smallest pieces of all the shredders out there back then and today. Unfortunately it is not the most heavy duty shredder and unfortunately one of the metal pieces broke. I called up Fellowes warranty department and was denied. I called to speak to someone else and was denied. They want me to send back the shredder which would cost me a lot and they may or may not replace. They told me that most of the time, they find it ""Is not under warranty."" I am thinking about getting the one at Costco, even though the one at Costco does not cut as small."
3,Messy but efficient,"I've only had this shredder about 2 months so I can't really attest to it's longevity.Pros. -- Quiet, handy removal bin, cuts well if you don't overload it.Cons. -- I found that right from the start it will tend to accumulate a lot of cut paper in the cutting head. It gets jammed in there pretty good so you are not going to get it out by reversing the motor. It will require some time and effort with tweezers and long nosed pliers.You have to be careful moving it around as the it is quite top heavy and proned to tipping over.The removal bin is a nice feature but it leaves a big mess inside the container after you have removed it. Paper residue will fall from the cutting head as you pull out the bin and land inside the container.I found that it didn't come close to shredding 12 pages as advertized and you have to be careful not to feed the paper in crooked if you don't want it to jam."
2,Poor design,"I'm not sure if all shredders are built like this one but this is designed poorly. To be fair, I bought my shredder used - it worked for about a month. Then it jammed one day after shredding 2 sheets.I opened it up and realized (just as others have said here in the previous reviews) that my shredder jammed because it collected paper pieces between the clamps that hold the metal shredder. These clamps are plastic and broke a soon as I loosened the screws to release the clamps. Now its rendered useless since Fellowes doesn't have replacement parts.I would NOT buy this shredder new or used. Even if it lasted 5 years, the steep price for a new one is not worth it. Its going for $160+ new now so it would cost me approximately ~$32/yr. You're better off buying a lower-end one for $20-$35 each year."
4,All IN the FAMILY.,"I ACTUALLY WANT TO GIVE THIS 4&1/2 STARS.I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS LITTLE TROOP AROUND NOW FOR A WHILE,AND OWN A LOT OF STUFF BY THE PROFESSOR(SHEHAB),DUB GABRIEL,THE WORDSOUND CREW,JP SLUYS,ERRALDO BERNOCCI,LASWELL AND THE LIKES.IF YOU DIG THE LAND OF BABOON SERIES,OR ANY OF THE WORDSOUND COMPS,I RECOMEND THIS,IT'S ELECTRO-EXPERIMENTAL,HIP-HONIC-SONIC FOR YOUR EARZ!AND,WITH THE PROFESSOR HERE,THERE'S A WORLD-MYSTICAL FLAVA FROSTED ALL OVER THIS.THERE'S EVEN A DIFFERENT VERSION OF ""FALL OF THE TOWERS OF CONVENTION""!EXACTLY WHY BOUGHT THIS CD!HELL,5 STARS!!"
5,Great Scale,The scale we purchased from Amazon.com was perfect. We feel that the scale has been worth every penny we spent. The package arrived quickly and in very good condition.
1,Warped,"The accuracy of a balance beam scale is based on the ability to get a good measurement.Once assembled, the balance arm slightly brushes against the indicator, which impedes free swinging. No matter how I try to manipulate the unit into compliance, it won't adjust so that the arm is free.Cheaply built, impossible to adjust to compensate for bad manufacturing, and thus not worth the money.Avoid."
1,Avoid this expensive maintenance hog!,"Owned the unit for a little over two years. Always paid the big bucks for Brother ink cartridges. Last year, I had to replace the print head which must be done at a repair shop for a cost of $.... Now the printer can not correctly sense the amount of ink in the black cartridge. The printer says the black cartridge is empty after only 20 pages. And the printer message is more than just a warning. The printer software requires replacement or it will not work. And Brothers tech support's only option is to take to the repair shop. I'm not going to waste any more money on this printer."
1,Terrible product,"I am very unhappy with this product. Looks like it has a serious design flaw: almost every time when you print something theprinter cleans its ink cartridges. Even if you print a plain black and white document it cleans ALL its cartridges which takes 3 to 5 minutes. Needless to say that it's extremely frustrating to wait for a few minutes to have a one page document printed.Furthermore, this unnecessary cleaning of cartridges forces you to replace them quite often. And the cartridges are not cheap!Another design flaw, in my view, is that after the printer runs out of color ink you cannot print black and white documents. Although I used this printer for less than a year, I am so frustrated with it that I am going to get rid of it and buy a new one, most certainly not a Brother brand."
1,Disappointing on the durability,"Purchased this item about 18 months ago. Printhead went out on the black making it useless unless we change the color on every document to colors other than black. The printhead was $1$$ plus shipping $$$, and I elected not to purchase these items. Instead I opted for a new printer (HP the psc 2210).What makes me really upset with these manufactures is that they are clearly making it impossible to consider repairing the product and creating so much waste for our landfills. Two years for a life time on this item isn't what I thought I was purchasing, and knowing that I'm contributing to global polution doesn't help matters either :("
1,"Oh, Brother!","""Piece of junk"" is too kind!We have easily spent more on ink cartridges than we did on the printer. We have yet to print one ream (500 pages) but we have replaced the black ink cartridges about 10 times, and they cost [$$] each. Maybe wedon't print often enough and the ink dries out, but I'm avoid printing to save on ink."
1,Being Sent Back,"Looks good, but very poor quality printing, took ages to set up using windows me, and then the scanner didn't work at all. USB set-up didn't work either. Swapped it for another make which was set up and working properly in under 30 minutes. I think it definately has problems under windows ME."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"The ink usage of this printer is outrageous. I have bought at least 20 black ink cartridges so far, some of them I put in right out of the package and it told me 'Black ink is out'.This happened to me the first time around and I contacted Brother, who send me a new printer. This one did about 20 pages in the first month or so (I don't print that much), then it told me the Black ink was out again. The next cartridge, once again right out of the package, told me 'Black ink is out' too. I tried several more, some printed for a little bit before giving me the dreaded message again, some didn't print out of the package. This even happened with genuine Brother cartridges (at $20 a piece)!I finally gave in and am trashing it. I have ordered the CANON PIXMA MP780 instead. Will never buy Brother again!"
4,Great Print/Scan/Fax but bundled software won't work on XP,"The Brother 9200C is an exceptional value and works well but you may not be able to use all the advertised functionality until Brother publishes an update to its bundled software. I use Windows XP, which contains built-in drivers for the 9200C. It scans and prints well but you can't install the software from the CD so the PhotoCapture Center, ScanSoft, PaperPortand and TextBridgeOCR that is advertised won't do you any good. HP has the same problems so the Brother 9200C is a better choice than the HP for most home/small office users"
2,Misrepresentation by Brother,"Potential buyers with WIN 2000 systems should be aware that the CD ROM software that comes with this unit is not compatible. You can download updated software from their web site, but no WIN 2000 compatible software is yet available for the PhotoCpture Center, one of the unit's main new features. Buyers are supposed to keep checking the Microsoft web site for it. All of this in spite of the fact that the unit container and even this site declares it fully WIN2000 compatible. This is a misrepresentation of this unit's capabilities. In addition, buyers who need technical support from Brother will have to wait two weeks or more for help. They are swamped, because many people have difficulty with downloaded software installation as compared with the normal automated CD-ROM process."
1,This unit not Windows ME compatible,"I can't rate all of the functions since the only thing I could do with this machine was stand-alone copy. It performed very well and very quickly, and also collates. I tried to install the drivers and software on my brand new Dell Dimension 4100 computer which came with Windows ME and after trying to restart the computer, Windows would hang up. I have spent over 5 hours on the phone with the Brother support people trying to resolve the problem, and they finally referred it back to their software unit. After waiting for 2 weeks and getting no response after several more phone calls, I returned the unit and gave up. I bought this unit because I wanted all the features, but it just won't work with Windows ME at this time."
2,Hand Tool won't open housing unit to change filter,"This is my 2nd multi-pure. The stainless steel ones were much better. The Hand Tool won't open housing unit to change filter. It's supposed to fit into these grooves to form a tight seal and nudge the unit open but the hand tool is too loose and the knobs just slide right out of the grooves. Basically, I just bought a $70.00 filter replacement and I can't open the unit. Incredibly frustrating. Bad design like this makes me wanna go postal."
4,ACTUALLY 4 1/2 STARS!!!,"I gotta admit that this isn't my favorite Moloko album, in fact in comparison to the remarkable ""Do You Like My Tight Sweater"" and the equally impressive ""I Am Not A Doctor"", it's somewhat lackluster. However, Roisin Murphy's vocals are more refined and the song-writing more heartfelt. There are some pretty impressive tracks here though such as the steady-groovin' ""Pure Pleasure Seeker"", the Timbaland-esque ""Absent Minded Friends"", the disco-infectious ""The Time is Now"" and the real-as-it-gets ""Mother"". Other songs kinda make you want to hit the skip button, but of course this is my opinion. Lyrically, Moloko has developed tremendously--Musically, their sound this go round is too poppish and mainstream. Nevertheless, if you're a Moloko fan you'll dig this!"
4,a very sexy fashionable album to get you in the right mood!,"I bought this album mainly because of the first single from it- "" the time is now"", which is simply amazing and the huge euro-club hit ""sing it back"". but I am very glad to report that i enjoyed almost all of the album. The second single to be realesed ""pure pleasure seeker"" is almost good as ""the time is now"". i definately recommend this album- it's sexy, has a good beat and put's you in the right mood to dance..."
2,Don`t Know What to Make & Do With This,"Although the hype is strong, this record is nothing to write home about. Moloko`s previous albums were experimental, creative and a bit bizarre and offbeat. Their third release, however, lost a part of that touch, presenting a couple of fine moments and a lot of so-so ones. It`s not bad, it has clever and witty songs but the final result is lackluster. Roisin Murphy`s voice still engages, even if the songwriting is subpar and somewhat blah. The singles ""Indigo"" and ""The Time is Now"" are both fine compositions, but they are lost in here since the album goes on for too long and its interest quickly fades. All in all, this record is a good one to skip, there`s certainly better things to make and do than listen to it."
5,Prepare yourself to be surprised,"This is nothing like ""Sing It Back"". You're warned. This album is really eclectic. There are some rock and folk-like thingies, trip hop and drum-'n'-bass, and of course some nice dance-pop. ""Remain The Same"" is really fantastic, and track # 16 is really strange - but fun. And we can also say thank U for the ""Sing It Back""-remix. Roisin Murphy has a nice voice - really childlike, a little bit like the Cardigans-singer. You can hear they've been having fun with this record, well, I also had a lot of fun listening to it."
5,"Very touching, helpful and moving book!!!!!!!!!!!",This book moved me to tears. Mrs. Vanderveen is a very talented writer. She explores the many emotions a grieving parent goes through- even the ones most people are afraid to acknowledge. I love her honesty and openess.It will help others feel not so alone with the emotions they will be going through...such as spirituality & sex. Her children are very lucky to have such a wonderful Mother who has left them a treasure of herself and their brother.
1,beware does not work.,This stuff does not work period. Leaves a strange film on the glasses. I tried this many many times according to the directions. Plus they charge 7.50 for shipping a little package regular us mail. I should have known but wanted to try and see if it did work.
2,Erases scratches,I tried it out on my perscription glasses and it did not work. It seemed to even highlight the scratches.
1,not worth the money,"If you have Rx glasses, do not buy this stuff. It will alter the thickness of your glasses and you will not be able to see. The stuff goes on with a q-tip type applicator and it is nearly impossible to get it to go on evenly, which also ruins your ability to see clearly. The only useful part of it is the lense cleaner but the price is not worth it."
1,unhappy with this product,As soon as I apply the treatment solution (step 2) to my lenses I see a colorful film left on them. the film does not go away when it dries. fortunately the cleaning solution does take the treatment solution off....otherwise this would have ruined my glasses.
1,Lens Drx :(,Don't waste your money because this product does not work! I tried it several times with the same results:(
1,Lens CPR Lens Doctor - Repair Scratched And Cloudy Glasses!,"box was ripped open, and was missing part of it, before being packaged and sent to me, missing part of it , did not work, complete scam. do not but from these crooks they will rip you off!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Didn't work for me either!,"It seems like it should work - just a clear coat to fill the scratches. The problem is it doesn't go on smoothly, leaving smears of material. I tried it several times, and then the applicator began to disinagrate, leaving 'fuzz' in the coating.Fortunately, the cleaner they provide completely removes the coating so there is no harm to the glasses - at least in my case.Bad product!"
1,A disappointment,"After repeating the full process a number of times, I have determined that the product simply does not do what it claims. It left the lenses on both my wife's glasses and mine with an uneven tinted coating that made our glasses next to useless. Thankfully, the product is easily washed off with the cleaner and warm water.I do not recommend this product."
1,Wish I had read these reviews first! JUNK,"I purchased this at Walgreens so didn't have the benefit of Amazon reviews. After trying several times, I looked up reviews and now see why it won't work for me. It won't work for anyone! This stuff is junk!"
1,I TRIED IT AND HATED IT,"I BELIEVED THE COMMERCIALS, SO I TRIED IT. I HAVE AN EXPENSIVE NEW PAIR OF PRESCRIPTION GLASSES THAT GOT A SCRATCH, SO I PURCHASED THE LENS DR. AS A TEST I USED IT ON AN OLD PAIR OF SUNGLASSES THAT HAD SOME SMALL SCRATCHES. NOW, I CAN NOT EVEN SEE THROUGH THE GLASSES. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY. WHEN IT DRIED, THE PRODUCT PUT A MILKY FILM OVER THE LENSES. IF YOU DIP YOUR GLASSES IN A GLASS OF MILK, THEN PUT THEM ON, YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I NORMALLY GIVE GOOD REVIEWS. THIS TIME I DECIDED TO WARN OTHERS BEFORE THEY MESS UP THEIR EXPENSIVE GLASSES. MINE WERE SOME OLD RALPH LOREN SUNGLASSES. THEY WERE PRETTY OLD, SO I'M NOT TOO UPSET. GOOD THINK I DID A TEST FIRST. MY ADVICE IS, THINK BEFORE YOU BUY THIS AND TEST IT OUT BEFORE YOU RUIN YOUR GOOD GLASSES."
1,Cheaper alternative?,"This product sounds no better than a much cheaper solution, such as Future Floor Finish.As a matter of fact, it may just be Future in a smaller, more expensive, form.Future has been used for years in the scale modeling community. One use is to provide a clearer finish to model airplane canopies. The canopy is dipped in future and then the excess allowed to drip off.Future has a pleasant distinctive smell, somewhat like a fruity bubble gum.If anyone has both this product and Future, I would be interested if they smelled the same."
1,Not even worth it when it's FREE,"So I ended up with an unused box of this stuff somehow. I did have some pretty scratched lenses thanks to a little dog who likes to run off and chew on plastic, but since they had a coat of anti-glare, I couldn't use Lens Dr on them.I had some scratched CDs and thought it would still work for them so I gave it a whirl. I went from skipping CDs to unplayable CDs. I'm sure it has to do with something technical that I don't understand, but I was trying to find ANY use for this stuff. Thank goodness I stumbled on another review here that said the cleanser removes the scratch filler so I can restore my CDs to all their skippy glory!"
1,Junk,Get some Elmers glue. Smear it on your glasses and wait for it to dry clear. This is about the same result I got from using this product. Save your money.
1,More Harm than Good,"It streaked and fogged up my glasses. I had to use alcohol to remove the film.Not only did it not get rid of scratches - it seemed to cause some of the scratches to become white lines. This is probably due to the high humidity of the day - it probably kept water molecules adhered to the scratches. But, even on flat areas, the film didn't do anything to improve the lens.Returned it to Walgreens for a refund."
1,dont not waste your money,"This product is horrible!!!!!!! I had to use finger nail polish remover to get this off my lens. Amazon was no help, the customer service rep i had spoke to about returning my purchase told me don't other, i would cost me more to send it back then just to swallow the los."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK,"I GUESS THIS IS THE WORSE PRODUCT I'VE EVER BOUGHT. THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE TO REFUND EVERYBODY WHO PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT. I HAD A PAIR OF MICHAEL KORR SUNGLASSES WITH A SMALL SCRATCH AND HATED TO THROW THEM AWAY SO I PURCHASED THIS KIT. THEY WERE WEARABLE UNTIL I USED THIS SCRATCH REMOVER, NOW THEY'RE TRASH. THE SPRAY CLEANER SUPPOSE TO REMOVE IT BUT IT DIDN'T REMOVE ALL. THEY STILL HAVE STREAKS. I CALLED THE DISTRIBUTOR TO COMPLAIN. SHE TOLD ME TO USE RUBBING ACHOHOL AND IT WOULD COME RIGHT OFF. IT WORKED. I'M JUST UPSET I PAID FOR SOMETHING THAT'S GARBAGE. I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN CONTINUE SELLING A PRODUCT LIKE THIS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"
5,An Aramaic Masterpiece,"Andrew Gabriel Roth provided an excellent work in his book ""Ruach Qadim"". As an Biblical Linguist myself, my original thoughts were that the Brit Chadashah was originally written in Hebrew and later translated into Koine Greek. However, after reading ""Ruach Qadim"", I am convinced of the Aramaic Primacy of the Brit Chadashah.""Ruach Qadim"" is a great start for those who are wanting to learn more about the Aramaic language and at the same time, it brings out the words of our precious Messiah Y'shua and other passages ten-fold. While it is not a grammar book, it will definitely leave you wanting to dive into Biblical Aramaic with it's numerous Aramaic examples versus the Greek.I would highly recommend ""Ruach Qadim"" to anyone serious about Bible Study. I am really looking forward to Part Two.Todah Andrew for an excellent masterpeice!Rav. Caleb Kinley,Edah YHWH"
4,A sweet story of faith and responsiblity,"""Partners"" is a story about a man and a woman who only know each other from passing each other on the stairs at the decrepit boarding house where they both live. One night, the man finds a baby lying on the boarding house doorstep and nearly frozen to death. Together he and the compassionate young woman fight for the baby's life, and fall in love in the process. It's a little bit simpler than a lot of Hill's books, but it's still a sweet story with a message of faith at the core."
1,If you are looking for music from The Snowman don't get this,"I should have read the CD cover with more care but it looked right though I couldn't see the copyright date or the main artists. This is a 'nice' CD, I was taught that nice is a good word for damning with faint praise. Anyway, it's nice, nice like all sickly sweet and amorphous things can be in small doses. But this cover version of Walking in the Air has none of the class of the Aled Jones original. Save yourself a few wasted bucks and buy a version with Aled Jones and the proper orchestration."
2,You can find the original soundtrack on Amazon.co.uk.,"If you're looking for the soundtrack to the film based on Raymond Briggs' book, this isn't it. However, the original soundtrack is available from Amazon.co.uk. (Search for ""The Snowman"" under popular music.)"
3,Walking in the Air disappoints,"This version of ""Walking in the Air""is not what I expected. I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews."
2,The Snowman Not,This is not the audio track from the film.At least Walking in the Air should be the original.
1,Very disappointed!,"Like the other reviews said, this is not the original soundtrack. I wanted to hear the angelic voices from the movie and was sorely disappointed. It's like any other Christmas music cd. I wish the discription were better and that I was wise enough to read the reviews first."
4,Love in this Life and Beyond,"AfterLife Love is the story of Shane and Rebecca, a love that blossoms in the physical world, and transcends into the afterlife, ever expanding the depth of their love, its meaning and the service it provides to others in both worlds. Not merely fiction, the story is based on ancient, Ageless Wisdom teachings presented in the author's first book, Life's Hidden Meaning. Whether you are a student of esoteric knowledge, or just interested in life beyond the physical, AfterLife Love will provide imagery and wisdom, through the lessons of the characters, for many hours of inner contemplation."
1,Giving the afterlife bad press.,"This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. I literally cringed as I forced myself to through page after page of some of the most inane drivel I have ever had the misfortune to read. How anyone can judge this book as providing ""insight"" to the afterlife is beyond me. The story is childish, the characters are shallow and promiscuous seemingly obsesessed with having it off with each other as quickly as possible.After putting up with the mushy idiocy of the main characters Shane & Rebecca, the advent of the good time souls ""Josh and Giffen"" was just too much - this book is now in the bin where it belongs."
2,Find Something Else To Learn Clairvoyance,"I see there are some highly positive reviews.Honestly, I cannot understand why. In fact, I am very annoyed at the author.This book lacks what it promises: practical instructions. He states over and over that he is going to share the ""secret instructions"" on how to do these wonderful things, but he never does. Where are the exercises and instructions you promised me Panchadasi?!This book is as far from an experimental manual as far could be.He gives only the shortest of instructions, as if in a passing manner.He may be good at using the abilities, but he certainly is lousy at teaching them.Skip this book. Find something else. Trust me.p.s. If you have a book suggestion for me on the subject of actually learning how to be clairvoyant through practice, please send me the link."
3,Spends a lot of time stating the obvious,Nothing new here. I don't know who Swami Parcheesi was but there are identical passages in a book on Clairvoyance by CW Leadbeater. The edition itself is nice but overall this book was a yawn.... The Serpent Power by Arthur Avalon is from the same era and packs in 100 times as much good info about relevant meditation techniques....
2,Not for Spiritualism,"Although this book is informative it's not for those that wish to be guided in their development towards the Spiritualism religion. What's consisted in this book is geared to other aspects of spirit contact and it's not actually what Spiritualism teaches 100% in Clairvoyance although there's some similarity.I ordered this book in mistake as I already had it but it was quite easy to sell, had 5 offers actually."
5,This is wonderful,"If you are interested in understanding the aspects of Disaster Response, particularly from a medical standpoint, this is the most comprehensive book there is. It is very well thought out, and thorough."
4,"Great game, but not all the order was supposed to be...","The product discription said that there were two games, Mario All-Stars and Super Mario World, the only reason I bought it. I waited eagerly for my Amazon order to get delivered. And when it finally did there was only one game, Mario All-Stars. I popped it into the NES hoping the cartridge had both games on it, but no. So although the game is fantastic, I am disappointed that the description has both games, but my order had only one."
4,Good seller,My product was delivered to me in a timely fashion. I was pleased with the quality of the game. I recommend this seller to anyone that is interested in buying video games.
3,Its a little messed up.,The original mario superstars had more colors and the gameplay was slightly faster. But with the addition of SMW the games took some colors out and made the game play lag in certain parts of levels that the original never did. But hey its all the marios in one Cart.
3,wasn't exactly accurate,"The seller did not send me the right model after the image of this item,although it works about the same as my old one which was the problem in the first place."
1,"Received a Phillips, does not work","I received a Phillips brand one, which does not seem to work. I got disconnected whenever the phone is connected, filter or not."
1,Not the item advertised,I bought 3 of these. one worked about as well as the ones supplied by my ISP. One doesn't appear to be functional at all. The brand that arrived was Phillips. Waste of money. Totally dissatisfied.
3,Average filter,"Using the filter is an improvement over no filter, but some noise is still present in the phone line. Seller was quick and provided the item in good shape as promised."
3,It did not work as expected.,"I was told, it would cut down on the noise in the phone line. It may have been O.K. but I could nottell, appeared ineffective and waste of money."
4,Title?,"I THOUGHT it was called 'Now and Them' while Amazon lists it the other way around!It's not a bad album though, one of a few to be released under the ""Them"" banner after Morrison's departure."
5,Them and now,The item was shipped quickly and was packaged very well which resulted in absolutely no damage. It was exactly as advertised.
2,"Great sending, poor receiving","We purchased this fax because our old one grabbed several pages at a time when sending. This Brother machine SENDS great - the memory feature is awesome. However, the paper supply constantly jammed when receiving faxes. It claims to hold 200 pages of paper, but it could never manage much over 50 without serious jamming issues. Even with a small amount of paper in the supply tray, we would have to clear the paper path about every third fax received. Customer service tried to help, but to no avail."
1,You only get one - not four,"I purchased this item thinking I was getting a case of four 2000 ml units, as is typical for this product. Wrong: you only get one. And Amazon states the original price was $49.66? Give me a break...what a rip! Also, the one they sent me looks like it had been sitting on a shelf for 20 years."
5,FABULOUS - A MUST HAVE!!!,"OK. Can I just say I love this book! It's witty, gritty and refreshingly honest. I can't wait to experience my next Happy Hook Up! Every single girl ought to own this book! Thanks very much to the Authors for writing such a much needed guide to casual sex! We needed it!!"
1,save your money,I expected that these would be fullscreen video similar to what came with the concert DVD of Fallen. This video quality is worse then whats available on most web sites.
1,Fellowes P400C-2 shredder,"I have owned two Fellowes paper shredders. The second Fellowes shredder is the P400C-2. The only problem I have with Fellowes Paper shredders is that each Fellowes Paper shredder that I have owned has quit working maybe a year or a year and a half at the longest after I bought it. It cost too much to repair, so I had to buy another one that quit working about a year after I bought it.I am now forced to buy another paper shredder but this time it will Never be a Fellowes Paper shredder. Ever again"
5,"Excellent shredder, even after 1 year. No complaints.","I bought this shredder a little over 1 year ago and it has been an excellent performer the whole time! I actually didn't buy this from Amazon.com but from Office Depot, and I paid about $125.00 for it back then (it looks like Amazon is now offering it for about $90.00, which is a terrific deal). Anyway, this shredder does a great job of shredding and I especially like the fact that it is a confetti cross-cut shredder, as it shreds your papers into such minute pieces that I can't possibly imagine how a thief could put together any of the pieces and make anything legible out of them. If you buy the shredder, definitely buy the shredder oil and oil the shredder at least once per month -- that's what has kept my shredder in such great shape. Buy it while you can at Amazon's low price -- you won't regret it."
1,Broke in 1 mo.! Slow and weak shredder.,Motor burned out in less than a month and stopped working. This thing is also pretty slow; my $30 shredder shreds at twice the speed. This huge ugly shredder can barely handle an envelope with junk mail in it; I have to actually open the junk mails and shred things separately or it will jam. I got really ripped off by Fellowes on this one.
2,"Not as ""heavy duty"" as you think!","You would expect a $150 shredder to at least be able to do the job expected. My shredder was not even 2 years old when it gave up. All I used it for was occasional old bill shredding. I can certainly say that the machine was not abused: I avoided staples, even though it supposedly can handle them. So after less than 2 years, one of the gears simply broke, rendering the machine unusable. I don't think I would by another expensive shredder from Fellowes. The cheap ones may last the same amount of time, but at least I am not out $150!"
4,good and bad,"With all the news about potential ways to have your identity stolen, I finally decided to get a shredder. During my investigation, I realized that the only kind to buy is a cross cut. Strip shredders simply don't seem anywhere near as secure. The Fellowes PS60C-2 works like a charm. I've only had it a few weeks and discovered two problems. First, the shredder is heavy enough to be awkward removing to empty the supplied container. It also completely covers the opening making it necessary to either purchase another can for bulkier trash and items not needing obliteration or reaching under the desk to `carefully' lift it off to gain access to the can. The instructions say the cutters should be oiled once a month. The company could have included a small tube of oil to get started. I am, by the way, very happy with my purchase and really do feel more comfortable when I shred old bank statements, etc. instead of tearing them into little pieces."
1,Junk,After a little more than a year this piece of junk broke down.....customer service said it was the gears and wanted about $25 for a repair kit (includes outrageous postage). I would avoid Fellowes..this is my second poorly performing machine.
2,Could be easier to assemble for the money,"While I must admit it's quiet and efficient, the basket is cheap andtoo flexible. I found it difficult to assemble so that the tab fit correctlyinto the slot; the basket kept bowing out when I put the top onand the tab wouldn't go in. I just want to warn other people incase they have trouble getting theirs to work properly. At first Ithought I had a defective machine."
2,Blades don't stand up,"The blades get dull after a couple years of use. We oil the blades once a month and it still doesn't perform. The machine never took 7 sheets like it is supposed to. We have in the end been only able to shred one sheet at a time. one at a time still doesn't work well. The clear window is great to see when full. However, we use a trash bag. When you pull the trash bag out the window rips it. We have to be very careful each time. When you take the top off the shredded mess always goes everywhere. The top part is heavy hard to use. A good purchase for $40 and under. Not a good purchase for the listed price."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SHREDDER!,"I bought this shredder to replace a Xerox model that I had that recently stopped working. I believe this one was at least twice as expensive as the Xerox; however, it is inferior in at least two respects. First, even though I believe it is purported to be""heavy duty"", it labors more and has more problems shredding the same amount of paper as compared to the Xerox. Second, it doesn't shred the paper as finely as the Xerox did - what comes out are strips about 2 inches long - it is not a crosscut shredder.The point is there is no reason to buy this model as there are are cheaper models available that perform better."
1,Buy it from someone else,Amazon.com makes the shipping cost hard to calculate.The cost will be very high.
2,Nice While It Lasted,"This shredder worked pretty much as it said it would in the literature. It is a step up from the low end ""personal"" shredders that can only take a few pages at a time and can't run very long without needing to rest.Aside from a basket that filled pretty quickly (you have to redistribute the shredded paper as it naturally forms a heap right below the blades), it did the job for me.But here I am 17 months later and it is semi-dead; it only runs in reverse and the operating lights are dim. I'm past the one-year warranty and only the blades are warranted for longer than that. It just dropped dead out of the blue and definitely wasn't overused. For a shredder that cost close to $100 I expect a LOT longer operating life."
2,Shred? Yes. This shredder? No.,"This is great: I can shred a dozen or so pages before it overheats and I have to wait 20 minutes. The 10-15 minute rule is, I suspect, based on single sheets. The more sheets you try and shred, the more the gears have to work, and the faster it overheats. Overall, I'm not thrilled. It's heavy and seems to spend more time cooling itself off than doing the job."
4,Good unit,"While not perfect this is a good unit. As other reviewers have said if you shred for too long (20 minutes or so) it will shut itself down and then you need to unplug it and let it cool off. While not great for high volumes it does great on 3-5 sheets at a time, has no problem with staples, old credit cards and I've even shredded some CD's with data on it. Although I wouldn't reccomend that last part."
4,Nice Intro Biography of a Forgotten Founding Father,"This was a great introductory biography of one of the forgotten founding fathers and the preacher who led the Great Awakening. The book gives a short personal history of Whitefield, his preaching, and his character. I'm thankful to the author for writing this book about such an influential but little known figure in American history. Although the book is only a brief overview of Whitefield, it will leave you interested to learn more. This is a great addition to the author's series of Christian historical figures."
1,How disappointing......,"With a load of previously unheard 60s stuff supposedly tucked away in an archive, it's a real drag to see what is just a regurgitation of previous issues (in this case the 90s ""See For Miles"" CD) with a few tracks added that are not particluarly in context or ""rare"". This is a real lost opportunity to excite Korner fans and gets a big ZZZZZZZZ from me!"
3,Ok - but not great,Not one of the better movies I've seen with similar story line. The producer and director could have smoothed out some of the rough edges during many of the scenes. Happy I did not invest a large dollar amount to view.
2,"not awful, just hmmm....",this movie was slow moving- poor acting- alot of arguing with family members in it- it is based on a true story- but this version is a bit far fetched- i would not buy again.
2,A Little Bit of Bing,"Disappointed! I have been awaiting this DVD since 2004 when it was initially supposed to be released. While the performances by Bing are very good, they are less than a handful. I was under the impression this was a Bing Crosby concert/show from 1965, but it is actually more of a showcase for various Irish acts of the day. Bing does about 4 songs - that's it! I wish the fact that Bing is more of an MC than performer was pointed out in the product description."
2,"Come on, format the kindle books...","For a kindle book of this price, you'd think that it would at least have a formatted contents to help navigate such a work... nope!Selling a scholarly work in kindle form without formatted contents and footnotes should be illegal.The low rating is not for content, but for kindle formatting."
4,Rotary organ heaven,"Alan Hawkshaw is a rotary organ genius, captures the 70's groove completely. Its like being stuck in an elevator, but a hell of a lot more fun. Pure retro gold."
3,Vaper 19220 HVLP Triple Set-Up Spray Gun Kit - 4 Piece,"Packaging was bad - the items were loose in the box and banging around. The ties that were supposed to hold the items in the box were missing. There were some dents and scratches because of this. It looked like maybe someone had returned the item. We found it difficult to get the consistency of the paint correct so that it would spray. There were no instructions. But once we got the paint thin enough, it worked well."
3,HVLP Spray Guns,I have only used the gun with the 1.7 nozzle so far for spraying epoxy primer. It worked well but I am still getting used to them. I would rate them higher if they weren't made in China.
4,Prepare to disassemble,because you would not believe where the paint gets to in the gun - the seals are a bit flimsy - but the spray is nice and even...good value for the money
3,what is up with the terrible packaging?,"Obviously no one with this company cares enough to even read the reviews? When mine arrived one of the guns was banging around against the other two having come loose in the box. My first thought was, what is now going to be broken? Then, later, I saw all the other reviews mentioning this. The guns are fine, the included pressure regulator is very plastic."
4,"Decent Guns, subpar packaging",Everything seemed to be as promised but as the other reviews state the guns work themselves loose from the bands in the box. I didnt see any damage to the guns but then again when I buy something new should I have to worry about damage to my new item??? Probably not.......Regardless the guns spray real good and clean easy.
5,Leann is all grown up!,I think that this is her best album yet. She has great song selections and she sings them all wonderfully. I couldn't be more happier with the cd.
4,pleasing better form with this album!,"I have always over the last few years bought each of leeann's releases, the last one was ok but was a little disapointed, this time however she has given us a few more uplifting songs with some good catchy beats, of all of her albums this one i have probably outplayed the others already. This hasn't been released in the uk yet so i bought it in advance and glad i did. The best of the bunch are ""I want to with you"" which is a great opener with a good upbeat pop/rocky sound to it - simular to a michelle branch track i would say. ""Something's gotta give"" is very catchy to sing-a-long to as is ""I got it bad"".Her vocals also are used better on this album, as i was disapointed before that such a mature distinctive voice on a young woman was not used to her advantage. There is a good mix here, some good slower songs that don't make you cringe, but overall a more upbeat album that is a welcome relief!"
2,Average&seems to Be the best she can do nowadays,"Leann Rimes at one time seemed to be having a very good career linned up ahead,but after making some hit&Miss Albums&that last Album which Sounded like a Reject Britney Spears&Jessica Simpson type of Projects Leann goes back into Her roots here. Problem is while her voice is still nice the Material is only decent on a couple of tracks tops.having a good voice don't mean a Pot of beans without the Goods to put into the pan to make it work."
1,I was really looking forward to this cd,"I really liked the first single when it came out and it made me anticipate the album months in advance. I figured the type of music on the album would be like on Blue. Unfortinatly I found this album to be very un-original....LeAnn could easaly pass for the modern Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Martina McBride types of singers. She's selling sex and the whole modern country singer image just to stay famous and rich - wh won't she decide to take a chance at being less-kown and do music that will be worth talking about decades down the road?"
2,A failed attempt,"Not even average in my books. Like the title reflects, it's a failed attempt by her to make a mark on her own. Sure, she has a voice but the songs she does are ""HO-HUM"" at best. There will NEVER be another ""BLUE"" and she knows it. The reason that got her recognized so much is because she sounded so much like the late great Patsy Cline. Singing Patsy Cline hits NOT hers! Until she learns how to write or sing songs of her own and create a style and sound that's her's alone, she'll be always remembered as a another ""copycat"" singer living off of other artist's hits!"
4,Great Pop-Country and more,"Leann goes back to her country roots a bit in this album. Which I must admit disapointed me a bit. But, her voice lives up to all expectations. The album isn't a compilation of sound-a-like tunes either. There's a great Bonnie Rait style track, I Got it Bad, mixed in with a variety of country styles and cross over tunes. If you like pop-country or are a Leann Rimes fan you'll enjoy this album.After having listened to this album a while, I really think that vocally she is stronger then ever. It also feels like she's finally found some peace in her life and its coming through in the music."
5,Her Best Yet,"This is by far LeAnn's best album. All of the songs on it are very well written and produced. She seems to have returned more to her country roots on this CD, but it's okay. The best songs on the album are ""I Want To With You"", ""Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense"", ""Probably Wouldn't Be This Way"", ""The Weight Of Love"", ""With You"", ""I Dare You"", and ""Some People."" This is a must-have album."
2,You Call This Country?,"This is your typical country cd. About 2 good songs and the rest are not worth hearing. Luckily, I did'nt pay full price for this one. Too bad for Leann. She has a nice voice, but it is wasted on this weak material Those who like this stuff don't like real country music. I don't think those people, or Leann herself, would know a real country song if it bit them in the butt. If anyone knows of a female country singer who can actually sing a real country song, please let me know. Please, no Shania Or Faith Hill. Those gals are selling sex, not music. I don't care how a singer looks. Should'nt the focus be on the singer's VOICE instead? Don't show me another pretty face or more cleavege. You HEAR music, you don't SEE it on the radio."
4,great music,"I bought this CD because I really like the single, ""probably wouldn't be this way"". I have never considered myself a Leann Rimes fan, but I do now. All the songs have great lyrics and overall quality of music. I'm really happy i bought it. it has become my favorite CD."
4,"A GOOD EFFORT, BUT SLIGHTLY REPETATIVE","""This Woman,"" the latest effort from country-music sensation Leann Rimes, is a slight letdown over her previous albums. Although her singing is better than it has ever been, the songs on the album become a bit repetative. The first four songs, for example, sound almost exactly like one another. This type of repetition detracts from the album. However, there are some songs that are destined to become classics, such as the superb singles ""Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense"" and ""Probably Wouldn't Be this Way.""Overall, ""This Woman"" is a solid effort that fans will enjoy from the most part.Grade: B+"
5,THIS WOMAN has grown up,"LeAnn Rimes has another hit on her hands. THIS WOMAN finds LeAnn returning to her country roots. The sound is very contemporary country. Vocally, she's never sounded better. She sings with so much power and emotion. The first single ""Nothin Bout Love Makes Sense"" is burning up the charts, already a top 10 hit.There's some great ballads on here. ""Probably Wouldn't Be This Way"" is a highlight about trying to move on from a past love. ""Some People"" is a song about being grateful for what we have. ""When This Woman Loves A Man"" is a soulful bluesy song that she just tears up wonderfully. ""Weight of Love"" is a great ballad too. Uptempo songs are plentiful on this album too. ""Wont Be Lonely Long"" is a favorite, I bet it will be a big hit if released. ""I Want To With You"" is another favorite. Other highlights include ""You Take Me Home"", ""With You"" and the ballad ""I Dare You"".LeAnn really has grown into a woman, and THIS WOMAN proves it."
2,Am I listening to the same album?,"I am not sure I am listening to the same tracks as the other reviewers, but I keep hoping LeAnn will someday feel ""it"" again. This CD is a continuance of the modern country pop that has lots of everything but feeling. Remember the first time you heard ""Blue""? You thought, I have to meet this woman, then you found out she was 13! What was in that song was feeling(and of course LeAnn's voice) Later, ""These Arms of Mine""( I may be the only one that has heard this song) had the feeling again. It may take a few divorces and soap opera like situations for LeAnn to feel it all the way, but when she does the music industry may just stop for a while and be amazed. It is in there and it will come out someday........slickrick"
4,Glad to have her back,"This is a good comeback album for LeAnn, back to the mainstream country that she does very well. Her voice is excellent, of course. The songs are fun and original. Well done."
4,Well Done!,"I really enjoyed this book! The characters were extremely well-rounded and fleshed out. After reading the novel, they stayed with me as if they were old friends.The story was realistic and held my attention. I read the book in a day and a half because I couldn't put it down. The dialogue was so natural. I truly felt like Barbara could have been recounting a true story word for word. The relationships between the characters are 3-dimensional, and I understood all the character's reasons for making the decisions they made. I cried, I laughed a little, and I felt alot.This book revealed some truths about how many people live their lives in fear of being unaccepted and unloved, and how some do not know how to show love or know when they are loved."
3,better videos on Spain,"I have seen better videos covering Spain, and have been there twice. I thought the Andrew Zimmerman video on Spain had better scenery and background information"
2,"If your an actual Kenshi, then this isn't the product for you...",While the shipping is fast from the this distrubuter the product itself is not very good. I've done kendo now for 6 years and I know a high quality shinai from a low one and this unfortunately is a low one. Only buy this if you just like collecting martial arts equipment or intend to use it for non-martial arts use.
5,BB King - My Kind of Blues,"This is, to my mind, the greatest BB King album. A pretty bold claim (I know), but I recently read BB King's autobiography, in which he states that this is his favorite album. After checking it out, I can see why he says this: the album is very sparse, relative to his other albums. Mostly, it's recorded with a backing combo of just bass, drums and piano (and very occasional backing horns) and the result is that it's the true ""essence"" of BB King, just him and Lucille with the backing band. On most of his other albums, the production is much more ""layered,"" with a heavy dose of a ""big band"" sound, and you just don't get to hear the man himself and see what he can do when he really stretches out on his guitar. This album is a real rarity and expresses the true essence of his art--if you like BB King, then this is an absolute must-have album."

2,Don't Bother,I thought this book was interesting from standpoint of the topics that were discussed but it was poorly written. I have read a number of other economic books written for the lay public and they were much better written. The author in a couple of chapters starts out with a good theory but then never proves it. After reading those chapters I wondered what point he was trying to make. I don't think he knew either. I cannot recommend this book.
5,Strange but True!,The sonic equivalent of a Buster Keaton movie. Hilarious and desperate at the same time. Mind expanding!
1,Nasty,Bought these at the local health food store for my kids 5 and 7. They are wet on the outside like they are dipped in liquid adult vitamins and are sticky. They smell and taste awful. My poor husband is going to have to take them or we'll be out $25. The taste lingers long after you've choked them downDisappointing!
5,Quality vitamin!,My child has taken this vitamin for several years and really likes them. They are a bit sticky so keeping them refrigerated makes them taste better.A good alternative if your child refuse chewables.
5,OUR FAVORITE VITAMINS!,"We love these vitamins, both kids and adults! I even keep a jar at work for myself."
3,Two Words: Picture Book,"For those familiar with Erich Hartmann and would rather see him than read about his life, this is your book. Text is limited."
5,A remarkable book about a remarkable individual.,"Erich Hartmann was so much more than the world's highest scoring fighter pilot. He was a man of great strength and character who was not in the least afraid to stand up for what he believed was right. This excellent book is filled with pictures and commentary from fellow pilots and a loving wife about an amazing individual. A must-read for any WW II aviation enthusiast. I couldn't put it down, so read it cover to cover in a day. This was easy due to the many high quality photographs with captions."
2,What on earth does she see in him?,"I remember enjoying many Sandra Heath Regency romances in the 1980s and downloaded this one published originally in 1981 just for a walk down memory lane. I don't know for sure if I'd read it long ago, but I hope not. Surely I didn't like that kind of an H/h relationship years ago.The hero here is an abusive jerk. Not exactly physically abusive, although he does shake the heroine once when he's upset, but definitely verbally and emotionally abusive. And the heroine falls in love with him the first time he storms into a room accusing her of being a deceitful, lying baggage.What's that all about? I can't stomach romances where the man is a jerk and the woman loves him anyway. How's that romantic? Save that crazy stuff for Dr. Phil so he can say ""What on earth were you thinking?""On the plus side, Sandra Heath is a good writer. Too bad the romance here negated that for me."
2,no no no,First of all this book was too short for all of the problems to be solved..The hero most of the book didnt act like he even liked the heroine until the book was almost over I was just as surprised she was that he even liked her at all.
1,troubles!,"At first I thought the CD was defective, until I read some of the reviews here, and it turns out the cd is incompatible wit some systems? Well, how is one supposed to know which cd-player is compatible and which isnt? The luck of the draw? they should compose a list so that I dont have to waste my time buying and then returning a disc due to incompatibility. Very dissapointed."
2,great CD but a warning is needed,"Charleys tribute to Gentleman Jim is great and i loved hearing those songs which i have heard him sing live before. my only complaint is that you cant read the warning label on this cd when buying online, and so you wouldnt know that this cd does not work on computers or some cd players. as it happens i like to listen to music in my kitchen on my imac and i cant do it with this cd which was very dissapointing."
1,CD doesn't work on my system,"i am a big fan of jim and charley so i was excited to get this cd as a gift. i was extremely disappointed to find this CD has some new technology that isn't compatible with many CD players out there, including both my home and car players. i had to go over to my neighbors place to listen to it! apparently the record company offers you free MP3's if the CD doesn't work on your player. i'd like to know what use that is as most people don't have mp3 players in their living room! i took the CD back and i will not buy another CD that is broken in this fashion."
1,Copy protection issues,"Due to the copy protection on the CD it will not play in most high end CD players, and will not play in any DVD player. I paid for the right to listen to the CDs music where ever and on whatever machine I choose, yet the record company wishes to dictate what CD players are OK for me to use. I will never buy another copy protected CD again, and I would not have purchased this one had the label of the CD indicated that the CD was disabled and wasn't usable in any high end systems. It would be a shame if others tried to use copy protection to limit the purchaser. The music probably is good, I just need to find a cheap enough CD player to actually be able to give it a listen."
1,The warning label,"The back of this CD has a big warning label which says ""This audio CD is protected by SunnComm MediaCloQ. It is designed to play in standard audio CD players only and is not intended for use in DVD players"".There is also a big warning label inside the CD which tells you how to download the digital versions. If you have Mac or Linux it tells you to go to their Website for downloads, but after I had given them all my info and answered a quiz about the CD I still couldn't find Mac or Linux software. ..."
1,Say NO to copy protection,"I spent several hundred dollars on mp3 players for me and my wife. A copy protected CD is useless with my MP3 player. I can't download the songs at work, and it's the only place I have Internet. What happens when they go out of business? This CD has been ruined by copy protection. I bought it elsewhere and tried to return it, but they refused since it was open. Don't buy this CD."
3,BEWARE OF COPY PROTECTION,"I regret buying this CD due to the copy protection. I've spent 15 minutes trying to play this thing on my PC and still have not heard the 1st note of music. It's a total pain in the butt.The CD plays fine in my car, however I like to listen to CD's at work and I'll be damned if I want to jump through hoops to play them. I've tried to contact Charley Pride via his web-site, but the email link is broke. I wonder if it was intentional.If you want to play this CD on your PC or if your stereo has a combination CD/DVD player, think twice before putting out your hard earned money."
1,sound of silence,What is the point of releasing a CD that so many people can't listen to? I give up with this one...I couldn't make it work.
2,Charley & Jim,I am a huge fan of both Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. Charley is probably the only one who can do justice to Jim reeves and he does do a terrific job on this CD. However I was disappointed to find it copy protected.
1,The record companies are ruining it for everyone,"Copy protection? OK, so I could swallow the insult of the producers of this CD assuming that I am a thief if I could listen to the music. But no - it won't play in any computer, so listening at work is out. Give this CD a very, very wide berth."
1,It will not play!,"The copy protection on this cd totally ruins the value of the cd. I cannot play this on my car cd stereo, my home or work computer, and my portable cd player. Don't waste your time or money on this cd with these outrageous protection schemes. Instead of making things easy for those who have bought albums, the industry only penalizes the hands that feed it."
5,Charley Pride is better than ever!,"I have this CD and absolutely love it. It's all about the music and if you're a true country music lover, then don't cheat yourself out of buying this CD. Only people who illegally download music should feel cheated with this CD. If you buy it, then you still have access to the MP3 files. You just can't get them illegally.I am a huge fan of the Nashville Sound and Jim Reeves certainly was one of the best singers of that era. Charley Pride does great justice to Jim Reeves' memory and you'll thoroughly enjoy every single track on this CD."
5,TAINTED REVIEWS,"Please weigh the reviews regarding the ""play-ability"" with a grain of salt...most were written by people who are opposed to protecting the digital property of musical artists, as this CD is the first copy protected CD in America. The people who write these bad reviews think that maligning a great U.S tradition such as Mr. Pride in order to promote their ""music ought to be free for everyone"" agenda is ok to do. The president of Mr. Pride's record company (Music City Records) reports ""only a small handful"" of customer complaints or refunds OUT OF 50,000 SOLD! Just thought you all ought to know!"
2,A Question (Not a review) I'd really like to know,"I'd really like to buy this CD but I've read the reviews of about 43 people who did and about 25 of them gave it one star because the copy protection prevents them from being able to play it in a wide variety of players. But all of these reviews are from 2001. There is a new version put out in 2006. Has anyone purchased this one? Does it have the same problem? (I gave it two stars based on the music samples sound great, but no more as there is no information indicating the play-ability problem has been resolved.)"
1,Copy Protected-Stay away,They used copy protection on this CD. Stay away. I'll never buy something like this again.
1,does cdparanoia fix this defective CD?,"Just curious,has any owner of this CD tried to fix the purposeful defects with the cdparanoia program?"
3,More of a geography,"Too much about streams, mountains and rivers and not much about the people of the area. Some info about the Sikhs."
2,Interesting but unnecessary,"This book adds nothing really new that has not been covered by Poul Jorgensen's classic book ""Salmon Flies - their character, style and dressing"" and unlike that book will never become a ""classic"" book. The only critiscm that I ever had of Jorgensen's book was that the illustrations were in black & white and lost some of the detail. Why ""Building Classic Salmon Flies"" did the same is a little puzzling in view of the great advances that have been made in colour printing and the few colour illustrations that there are in the book are of poor quality. I learnt absolutely nothing new from this book and in view of Ron Alcott's reputation I was somewhat disapointed. I would rate this book as a mildly interesting book for a library on Classic Salmon Flies; but unnecessary."
3,I don't like,"The content of the book is not what I wanted, contains techniques!I don't like this book , and binding is not good"
3,"I grew up with Mark, he can do better than this.","Mark and I used to mess around in different bands in high school, he's a very talented musician, that I know. I would give a better rating, but I don't care much for Jazz."
4,kick-azz rock n roll,"Like the other reviewers have said, it simply rocks and rocks hard. No ballads here. Just tight, enjoyable tracks with a lot of rock n roll energy. A real kick in the pants. If you want something you haven't heard but that rocks straight ahead and with a little fury, this is worth your time for sure. A very nice surprise and welcome addition to my collection."
4,"Don't be afraid, it's only rock and roll","This album is short, fast and fun. They bring the rock from the get go and they don't stop bringing it. It clocks in just under 30 minutes, so be warned. But, be prepared. You just might want to go out and buy a Trans Am after you get done with this one. And that ain't half bad."
4,cheaper than at the college book store,"This book was in the same quality as if i would have bought it at the college book store, but about $10.00 cheaper. It is a good read, and helps create a better idea of how to view a things with cultural relativism."
3,Hmm,It had some highlighting in it which I didn't expect but at least I have the book for class now!
3,How do the Yanamamo see Chagnon?,"Chagnon's book is one of the most widely read ethnographies of tribal and animistic people. In it you read how Chagnon sees the Yanamamo. If you want to read how the Yanamamo see Chagnon and other 'nabas' read ""Spirit of the Rainforest"" by Ritchie. It is written from the perspective of a Yanamamo shaman. You will discover things not covered in Chagnon's work."
4,Wonderful monograph about the Yanomamo,"In every way this is a very interesting topic. University of Michigan anthropologist, Napoleon Chagnon has written a very readable monograph concerning the Yanomamo people of southern Venezuela. The Yanomamo live near the Orinoco River and prior to Chagnon's ""discovery"" this tribe was virtually untouched and isolated from the outside. Before buying this book, you need to have a reason for reading it. Students of the social sciences and anthropologists would be remiss to not read this book. It is an outstanding look at a wonderfully fascinating group of people. And for this reason, I would highly recommend it"
4,Surprisingly good B movie!,"I always browse the 'B' section of the movie store, looking for diamonds in the rough. I rarely find them, but this one was an exception.Decent plot, good acting, interesting storyline, and some fascinating characters combine in this action movie to make it an enjoyable experience. Seeing old favorites like Stacy Keach and Jennifer Beals on the screen was a definite plus."
2,super actor better as superman!,"this movie was a little slow at points, however the chick more than makes up for the lack of action. Shes pretty and hes used to be superman. This movie about a meglomanic that tries to use the ""militia"" for his own gains. Former superman actor Dean Cain stars in this slow military drama, but his acting is what amuses me most. If was interesting to see him act or the lack of it!"
1,Unforgivable,"Fifteen minutes hadn't passed during this movie before I stopped watching. Aside from being one of those movies you know they write the scripts for in five minutes, I was shocked to find scenes STOLEN directly from Terminator 2, with simply a change of characters and music. It doesn't matter if they were given permission to or not, such a lack of effort and creativity deserves no merit. Do not even watch."
4,A New Way of Looking at Things,The author explains that church growth is not simply an exercise in increasing numbers. The author discusses four ways that churches can grow and emphasizes that all churches can grow in at least one of these ways. This is an important book for anyone who thinks that church growth is only about adding new members.
3,Legal vs Illegal,"This is a good book for content, Nice and neatly written. On a number of tunes the changes are better in the Illegal versions."
4,almost real book,"No surprises here. Solid and easy to read with the 'handwritten' font. Just like all fake books, there are a few songs you buy it for and all this other stuff comes with it. Also, like all fake books you don't always find the 'one' your looking for. I am however not a fan of this kind of binding. I still say go for it!"
4,What is this...,"So many of the reviewers here HAS to mention that owning the book is now LEGAL, because the publisher went through the trouble of licensing the songs, like a good corporation should. See, I don't have a problem with that per se, but when the publisher makes a stink of letting us know its LEGAL and I see some reviewers jumping on that particular bandwagon, I can't help but get this suspicion that something is afoot.Like, you had the old (unlicensed=illegal) fake book for years and it really tormented you to know that the rights-holders (not the composers, note!) weren't paid their dues, but now, having the LEGAL copy you just feel so much warmer inside. Give me a break!"
1,SONG LIST,"I would very much like to know the names of the songs contained in this book BEFORE I decide to buy it.How may I access the ""contents"" page listing all the songs?PETER de NIESE"
5,great book,I was very happy with the product. It arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly how it was described. I would glad by from this seller agin in the future.
3,decent,book was coo.. he's not up thea with actual fictional writers...but its nice to hear from an expert on the profession. and wats up with the corny napoleon guy?
2,non mi piace molto,"This is a typically overpriced intermediate language textbook that is usually purchased by students under compulsion by a syllabus. For those of you who are not compelled to buy this text, I would not recommend it for self-study. It is not the worst, but the exercises are often poorly written such that they are either way too easy or too ambiguous to know how to answer. There is a lot of new vocabulary introduced, but not enough repetition to lead to longterm acquisition. In conclusion, there are better choices available for the intermediate student of Italian. (tune in to the RAI, per esempio: www.rai.it) Buona fortuna!"
3,Così Così,"I purchased this book for a class and at first I had thought it was going to be great but I was wrong. I did not really like the examples. This book is NOT horrible, yet it is for students of Italian mostly above an italian 4 class( meaning italian 5 or 6 or etc). They give very little examples and expect you to know a lot (which isn't bad and is expected;however most people must sometimes take time off for personal reasons). Some of their examples do not even clarify exactly what they expect you to do. Also, there is no answer list behind the book so you must depend on your instructor to check your answer(s) one by one. Bottom line if you HAVE NOT taken Italian in a few years/classes, please try NOT to buy this book. If you need to, BUY a USED copy so you will not spend over $100."
3,"Useful, but expensive","The high price of this textbook reflects the weirdeconomics of publishing for the college crowd. Theperson already battered by a trip to the collegebookstore may not even notice that she's just paidover eighty bucks for a paperback.That said, I found this to be sufficiently useful andportable that I have taken it to Italy on severaltrips and I find browsing it useful. There is a smalldictionary in the back, but probably, if you haveused this book for a while, you'll be better offwith the soft-covered Garzanti which is also (relatively)portable.As with any text-book, there are lots and lots ofthem on the used market and that would be the firstplace to look for a copy. Try to find one used by alazy student or at least one who didn't write theanswers in the book itself.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN 9781601640005"
3,Interesting Book,This is a very good book and is very explicative all the technics about origamic art.
3,"A good start, but, not quite enough...","I know this book is about child's laws, but, I find it hopelessly flawed when it comes to parental rights and how to protect your rights. If a parent loses their rights, it affects the children. I think there should be a chapter on how to protect yourself during a CPS investigation. The author doesn't really acknowledge that CPS is sometimes wrong and sometimes show a blatant disregard to the rights of the parents and the child. Those issued should be addressed. However, it does seem to cover the judicial process pretty well. Has some good information in all other areas. I think for the price there should be more. I would NOT make this the only book in your library."
2,Leading the beginner astray,"While some of the information contained in the book is useful, the reviews given here by beginning welders to beginning welders is potentially misleading. For example the author fails to provide proper information on the basic gas welding set-up. He starts with opening the valves and skips to lighting the torch, completely by-passing the installation of the regulators and properly leak checking the complete OFW system (bottle valves, regulators, lines and torches), not to mention the importance of blowing out the talc new hoses contain. This is just the OFW side of the book and there isn't enough space here to cover the MIG/TIG side.Wanting to learn to weld? Save your money and when you buy that Victor kit you've been wanting you'll find that it comes with a small welding and cutting manual that has far more information and is far more clear, concise than this book."
4,Good beginners resource.,"A little bit of everything without getting too complicated. Focus seems to be on gas and TIG welding, since the author evidently uses those methods primarily. The section on MIG welding is weak compared to the other chapters but it's better than most beginners books anyways."
1,Not what I expected!!,"This book does cover all types of welding processes but shows absolutly nothing on the techniques. I am a beginner and hoped that ""A Complete Guide"" would be alot more complete than just showing what each process will accomplish. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on this one."
3,Good overview of welding but too general.,"Finch does a good job of identifying and describing welding process and techniques. I would recommend this bood to someone trying to decide what type of equipment to buy and it's capabilities. However, for specific process (i.e., MIG welding of aluminum) it is a little more general than I was hoping. Not much in the way of trouble shooting welding probems for each type of welding described."
4,Excellent book on all forms of welding,"This book covers all forms of weldig in enough depth to understand each process. Combined with the author's other book Performance Welding, makes a complete guid eto welding for the enthusiest."
1,Not very complete or accurate,"I returned this book because it had a number of faults.It was in general lacking in real detail compared to other references as published by the welding machine companies like Lincoln and Miller. It has a lot of mis-information, incomplete information and half truths.It has plans for some pretty poorly engineered trailers and other devices. After seeing his diary of a project toward the end of the book as a filler I realized that this was the same Finch who wrote the old Corvair book in the 70's and also had a project diary in the end as a filler. If this guy really insists he is a certified and or nuclear welding inspector I'd challenge that."
3,Excellent beginners book - needs editing & updating.,This book is a good beginning to inform you about welding. It is not a manual to teach you welding. It gives you enough to go further and ask intelligent questions. There are some misspellings and some garbbled sentences. More examples of what is bad need to be shown. Some info he mentions about the AWS and the AMS needs to be updated as their products are very very expensive. You will learn from this book but you will need to read others as well or attend a class at a local community college.
3,Another book for the shelf,"Perhaps I'm too tough on these authors. Over the past year I have purchased at least 5 of these types of books, and find myself disappointed at the lack of pertinent information.This particular book had some decent information on the various processes, but I do not feel that it went into any of the processes with enough detail.Finch states that you should learn GAS welding first. This was of no help to me. I purchased a MIG mainly to do sheetmetal / autobody repairs.I'd recommend looking at some of the welding manufacturers sites and buying technical manuals or videos from them rather than buy from Finch.Unfortunately, I will probably be too stupid to listen to my own advice next time I go to purchase a book. I'll come right back here and buy one of these crappy little paper-backs that don't give nearly enough information."
4,"Fairly thorough, practical","Despite a thorough job, his section on gas welding aluminum has errors. Hydrogen gained popularity over acet. during WW2 when acet was rationed to shipyards. Aircraft factories used either gas routinely. Antiborax flux has been notoriously unreliable for 8 yrs, now. The cobalt blue glasses are dangerous and have been superceded by the special TM Technologies safety-tested TM2000 lenses for 10 yrs. His steel welding information is very good, and well-researched."
3,Too much FINCH,"There is some good information contained within the covers. However, there is a large amount of wasted ink and space. It appears as though the author feels that informing you of the types of tow vehicles he owns and maintains(laughable)is more important than welding facts and examples. The author repeats the informative verbage of ""if you are right handed....., if you are left handed...."" too many times, it appears as filler just to get ink on the page. The information relating the race car teams he has worked with and the antenna he built for someones boat and the associated pictures are not relative to the title and merely take up space within the contents. The materials discussed to build the projects dont match the pictures, which arent in detail themselves. Your money could be better spent."
4,Above-average,"Good overall coverage of all types of welding. I was hoping for a more thorough coverage of arc welding, though. Text was clear and well presented."
1,non foaming foamer,bought this foamer thought it would b agreat item at my carwash instead all I got was 75 dollar sprayer when I can buy them all day at wally world or ace or on+on+on+on their instructions where incomplete
3,2-Gal foamer,Overall it is a good sprayer. However as a foamer it is hard to keep the foam coming out in a pattern even with a foaming agent. You will blow you arm out with all the pumping you do so be careful.
5,Great Book on Vultures....,This book covers everything about the vultures from around the globe!!! My favorite is the Lappet Faced!!! Featured in this book and on the cover!!!
5,After the Affair - Review,"This book helped me start the healing process. I highly recommend this book. My husband and I both read the book together. He would read a chapter and then I would read a chapter. It not only helped my husband know what he had put me through emotionally and physically, but it helped me learn to move forward."
2,Deeper questions remain undiscussed,"After the affair is very helpful to understand the feelings of the hurt partner, yet it lacks in a deeper discussion of questions around human needs, sexuality and interpersonal relations and their inter-winding with society. It's defense of marriage is not well explained or justified, and it may build up to unrealistic expectations from one's partner or even a sense of hopelessness to the realizations of the out most human experience of love and sexuality. From my point of view, it seems a bit conservative and does not provide much help to those seeking to get a closer and true understanding of who we are, as individuals and as partners."
2,Not a good book,Not a good book for the person who was betrayed. The book encourages you to forgive and that you are also to blame.
1,Waste,I didn't even bother to skim this book and I already know I'm sending it back as soon as I can!
1,Blames the unoffending partner,"While this book does a good job of letting you know that ALL of the feelings that you are having about your cheating partner are valid and other people have them too, this book goes on to ask you ""what did YOU do to contribute to your partner's infidelity?""I found this to be rediculous because all I ever did was trust him, obviously to my own dismay. This book doesn't really give you the tools to try to forgive and learn to trust again. It basically says to decide if you want the relationship and then suck it up and let the past be the past.In my own assessment, if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. The past cannot just be left to be the past. It needs to be forgiven, but NOT forgotten. If you really want this book, let me know...you can have my worthless copy."
1,Didin't fit the profile,"After continuously skipping threw the book, I came to page 111 and realized this book was not for me. So if anyone knows of a book for those of us who don't blame ourselves and want to try and put the marriage back together. Please let me know. This book is for people who need moderate-serious counseling."
2,From the HURT party,"This book was very painful to read as the ""hurt"" party. It makes you revisit very painful experiences and feelings, which I had dealt with already. The unfaithful party would rate it 5."
4,Presents both sides of an affair,"I felt that this book was excellent at expressing the emotion of both the betrayed and the betrayer. And I was the betrayed. Unfortunately, as of right now, we are not working on our marriage and my spouse is with his lover.After, Igave him this book, he stopped seeing her temporarily."
4,Helpful,Helped me to understand my feelings were not unusual. Gave me helpful tips on how to overcome the anger and resentment.
5,Spot on,Very insightful. This book is really helping me understand what I am going through and what my partner is going through. I think it is constructive information and the advice is solid.
3,"Some good points, worth reading.","Worth reading if you are trying to learn how to let go of those build up emotions after discovering of your partner's infidelity. A book your partner should also read if he/she wants to understand what YOU went through after discovering the same.The only thing that I absolutely did not like about this book is how the authors made the hurt ones seem somewhat pathetic.By pathetic, I mean that every single one of them seem desperate to want the cheater back no matter what he/she did.BTW,I only read this book after my husband and I had been to about 8 counseling sessions and the MFT suggested that I read this. We are still in counseling as books can't solve our problems.He did not physically cheat on me, he emotionally cheated on me with women he met in chat rooms which led to cell phone calls over a period of one year. We have been married for 24 years and it just might be over real soon. We have a 9 year old daughter."
2,Not my favorite,"I was not impressed by the advice in this book.I think no two affairs are the same, neither are all waywards or all betrayed spouses.Her approach seemed to be very one size fits all.Maybe it will help some people but it doesn't help all.The old adage of bad marriage=affair needs to be looked at again.Sometimes there are seriously messed up people that have affairs and fixing the 'broken marriage' will NOT fix them."
4,Still works way after the affair,"I purchased this book about six years ago and was so impressed and helped by it. Then a few days ago I ran across it and read some chapters and was amazed at how it still held true. It can help when you are still feeling some insecurity about your relationship due to a past indiscretion. For some reason I was feeling like we were not communicating and that book popped up at the right time. It helped then and still works. It's a good read, especially in the beginning of the aftermath."
4,It gave words to my feelings I have been unable to express.,"This book has helped my partner and I make the decisions to forge ahead and rebuild our marriage. Rather than just offereing empty hope, this book offers insights to all aspects of what each of us felt during the healing process. Some topics, although not applicable, provided insights into other aspects of our marriage. It would have been great to read this book years ago, when we first got married or had our first falling out."
5,Trust again,I have only read part of this book so far but I was amazed by how much I read that reminded me of what I have been going through. My wife of 11 years had an affair with a friend of ours at work. We are working things out but one big problem has been my feelings----I had no idea what to think and if these feelings were normal or if I was going out of my mind. It has already made a big differance to me.
2,For the woman,I am a man and there are very few books directed at men who were cheated on by their wives. This book speaks to women. I guess men are immune from hurt.
4,After the Affair,Good reading. Thanks and God bless!! I will always buy from Amazon. Everything I have bought always comes as I was told.
1,"You see the ballerina, but it also goes to blu-cpu1.eu","The ballerina is in a design drawer in these ""tapes."" She is in alacrity. So enjoy the ballets. The scores are not ballet doors. Just be aware and be positive."
5,"Amazing Movie, Wonderful Soundtrack","I really recommend this item, I saw the movie and I love it. The music Rules!!!! The soundtrack sounds tremendous!!! All the voices are great. I love Idina Menzel and her role of Maureen. Take me or Leave me is one of my favorite songs in the album. I haven't the opportunity to see RENT in Broadway but I'll really like to watch it and sing every song. IF you buy this item you'll have no regrets that's for sure. A little bit expensive but it really values it. BUY IT!!!!"
2,Save your money- Buy the original,"The soundtrack for the original 1996 broadway soundtrack is much clearer with incredible sound. A personal fave of mine! This album is just a new version of these songs produced for the movie coming out this month by mostly the same actors. See the movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy it but when it comes to wanting to hear the music from the movie day after day buy the Broadway soundtrack. You'll be much more satified."
1,The Rent is too damned high!,"I represent the ""Rent is too damn high"" party. People working eight hours a day, forty hours a week and some have a third job. Women can't afford to feed their children, breakfast, lunch and dinner. My main job is to provide a roof over your head, food on your table money in your pocket and a copy of the Rent soundtrack. As a Karate expert I will not talk about any of the songs on this album, aint nothin to talk about because our children can't afford this album once again why? the rent is too damn high."
1,Original is lemonade; this is REALLY sour and bitter lemons.,"I first was a rent STAGE FAN, owning the original cast album and addictly seeing the play. I then got this soundtrack, which leaves out 3/4 of the good songs. I mean really: Angel does not even sing contact, and there is NNNOOO song ""christmas bells"". Rosario Dawson sucks and should play britney spears, not Mimi. I gave the original 5 stars and this one. OMG. Mimi should be EDGY not GLITZY. I feel bad that Daphne Rubin Vega had to watch her awesome part be ruined by Rosario Dawson's ""valley girl"" voice. As for the original cast, especially Wilson Jermaine, their voices almost matured too much.So in the movie recording, Angel does not sound sweet anymore. If you buy the original cast recording you'll end up marrying the recording and worshipping it. If you buy this recording it will etiher end up in the garbage or in the fireplace. If you burn it-LAUGH!"
2,Love the movie...hate the soundtrack,"I wish I could report that this album is the bomb, but I can't. Aside from Seasons of Love, the album is farily lackluster. Although the singers do a good job and their voices are decent enough to get by, it's not enough to bring the songs up to snuff. I'm fairly disappointed because I was really looking forward to buying this soundtrack. The tunes are boring and the lyrics are neither innovative nor expressive enough. I don't know if anyone would be willing to buy this whole soundtrack just to get one song. Hoepfully, a single will be released if it hasn't been already.For all of you Rent fans out there I'm sorry. I had to be honest!"
5,Spellbinding.,"Just proves you don't have to be Hannah Montana to have hit songs.Stand outs:""Another Day""""I'll Cover You (Reprise)""""Tango: Maureen"""
5,FINALLY!,"I am excited to FINALLY see and hear a movie musical with most of the OBC in it. As a theatre geek and musical lover, I was enraged by Phantom of the Opera. The vocals were off and only Patrick Wilson had actual musical experience. Everyone else was really off.As for Rent, the soundtrack sounds wonderful. Adam, Anthony, Taye, and Indina all sound great. I will admit that Rosario's Light My Candle is a bit off. She didn't quite nail it and the tempo is a bit too slow. However, I am VERY excited to see the movie and I really enjoy the Soundtrack. If you are a Rent Fan, you must buy the Soundtrack."
4,Not totally thrilled...,I feel that Rosario Dawson just doesn't have as strong of a voice as the rest of the cast. I could go on but I won't. Other than that I think it's pretty good.
4,"""Rent"" soundtrack","The music from ""Rent"" is so energetic and exciting. I don't need the movie to enjoy this music. This music sounds good on a soundtrack."
1,Dreamgirls will always be the best musical ever!!,"I hate ""Rent."" I hated the Broadway show, I hated the movie, and I hate this soundtrack. It's too vanilla and plain. Plus, I can't stand Miss Rosario Dawson. Save your money, honey, and check out the new ""Dreamgirls"" movie which will star Miss Beyonce, diva extraordinaire!"
1,I can't stomach this.,"Musicals, in themselves, are bad enough but something about this one sounds particularly tortuous. Perhaps it is teh dumb girl in the makeshift Catwoman costume, or that really annoying looking blond queen with the glasses and video camera, or it could just be Rosario Dawson herself. Avoid this turkey."
1,DID some1 juz said RENT?,yeah..rent it is good enoguh..dun buy..rent it..dun waste ur money and unnessary stuff like this..
4,"Money on ""Rent"" is well spent.","Some may not agree, but this is basically ""The Best Of Rent"". The biggest ""Rent-heads"" may want the complete 2-disc version, but casual fans should do fine with the highlights. I have seen the play, and these songs from the film rock just a tad more, yet are mostly the same. The opener ""Seasons Of Love"" is great, and is the song the cast always sang on TV appearances. The track ""Rent"" rocks, ""One Song Glory"" has a nice hook, and ""Light My Candle"" is sweet and flirty. ""Out Tonight"" is a full-on rocker, and sung very well by Mimi (Rosario Dawson). Other favorite tracks are ""Santa Fe"", ""Without You"", and the catchy and truthful ""What You Own"". Overall, anyone who even remotely liked the play or movie, or might enjoy the most rocking of show-tunes, should cough up the cash for ""Rent""."
5,Grabs your soul,"I love this music. When listening to the music you understand what the characters are feeling, you get a sense of their world. All this happens by listening to the cd. But why stop there? If you enjoy the cd, which you will, you will definently enjoy and be moved by the movie. It's a tale that everyone should see. 10 years on Broadway doesn't happen for just any story. This one is special and touches me deep in my soul. It's well worth buying."
4,Good Music...but lacking.,"I purchased The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and I love it (although, its not OBC) it holds its own on a different scale. If you're looking for a more broadway sound, obviously try the Original Broadway Cast, everyone's the same (except for Mimi - Rosario Dawson and Joanne - Tracie Thoms). If you're more rock and are THAT into showtunes, get the full length CD.My friend purchased the Highlights after seeing the movie (which she LOVED) and she finds that some of the most moving songs like 'Another Day' aren't on there. SO, I'm just warning potential buyers...the original movie soundtrack may be more expensive, but its worth it. You can capture the FULL magic of it.I love this musical and this cast, I would hate to see you miss out."
5,win a grammy please,"the rent soundtrack HAS to win a grammy. it is so good, i listen to it on my iPod every day. the play is even better. the movie was overrated. the music from the 1996 cast is not as good as the modern. you want talented musicians, pick up this soundtrack. why do you think this is loved throughout the music world?"
5,I'll cover you.....,"My wife introduced me to Rent around 5 years ago by playing the cd from the broadway production. I thought it was pretty good, but I couldn't really get a grasp on what the big deal was. 5 years later after seeing the movie, I am now in love with all things rent. This cd is excellent... but I really don't think you could go wrong with any of the other rent cds. If you're a new fan... this cd is an excellent starting point. I can't wait to see the play in February."
4,Amazing music; must not mind obscenity,"The music and all of the voices are superb and incredibly catchy. The story is touching and profound. However, you do have to bear in mind that these are bohemian artists of New York, whose lives are shaped by AIDS. If that lifestyle bothers you, this celebration of said lifestyle isn't for you."
3,as advertised.,I bought this for my room mate at his urging. He loves this album. I am not such a good musical fan myself.
5,Great soundtrack,"Really liked this movie and have watched it a few times, so I picked up the soundtrack. It's great..all the songs from the movie are included."
3,over produced and loses its rhythm,"Not a fan of this CD at all. They have changed the pace of many of the songs a great deal and they lose their feeling. I would love to know how this was recorded because i think it is the doing of the producer and engineer rather than the vocal talent. The vocal sounds much thinner and the whole cd sounds much more hyped up than the original, and alot less honest.Maybe call it modernising? it seems to me like they are trying to fill gaps that were never there. Bass licks thrown in that make the songs lose their direction, over done vocal aerobics etcthere is too much focus drawn to moments that once drew you in in a very subtle way. Take Collins in 'i'll cover you, reprise' its a quarter the pace of the original and sounds terrible.Some records take a step forward the second time (alanis morisette - jagged little pill) this one takes a definite step backward."
5,GREAT!!!!,"Watch out OBC fans....this recording just may be better!!! No really... this is such a great c.d. for such a great film. Its mainly the same cast, except for Rosario Dawson as Mimi, and Tracie Thoms as Joanne... and personally, I think they are so much better than the original Mimi and Joanne. Go get this c.d.!!! Its so good!!!"
4,how about love,"I know I can't be the only one curious to see if Chris Columbus (yeah, the Home Alone guy (!)) is going to louse up the film version of Jonathan Larson's modern Broadway classic (or, if you'd rather, how fearfully he's going to de-gay it). The early returns are encouraging: Chicago proved that musicals can still pack `em in, and this one has a boffo trailer that is hilariously simple - two-plus minutes of film clips playing under the soundtrack's MVP ""Seasons of Love."" There's exactly zero chance of this being a radio hit, not with the saga of Mimi's emancipation still chugging full throttle, but no matter. If you went to the movies even once this summer, odds are you learned the hard way that ""five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes"" epoxies itself to the inner wall of your brain on contact. Most of what passes for pop music lately should have so thrilling a lyrical hook."
4,Excellent -- much better than the stage play,"Four and a half stars. The singers absolutely shine. The production is superb -- really, they should have done so much more on the original. It actually sounds like ROCK music where appropriate, instead of show music with a few rock trappings, and show music where appropriate. Also, the vocal parts are brought out better and much easier to hear. I have new respect. And it's not a ""Seasons of Love""-fest. I was so afraid they were going to beat what is probably the best song to death in the movie. Thank God they had some restraint.One problem: autotune on some voices, which was really obvious, even when I was watching the movie. They did this on the original cast album, but I was hoping they wouldn't do it here. Oh well. That hardly spoils what is otherwise a fantastic recording. If you like the original, pick this up."
1,Not a tenor,"It's misleading of Russell Watson and his record company to claim that he is a ""tenor"". I've listened to this cd and has come to the easy conclusion that Watson is neither a tenor nor a geniune classical singer.The reasons? Watson's narrow voice range and the small size of his voice (he can't perform without amplification) renders him merely a crooner instead of a real classical tenor. Besides, he doesn't have much flair in performance, too, for his renditions are all musically clumsily to the extreme.If what is represented in this joyless recording is real classical singing, then even a piece of ordinary plastic can be considered as 999 karat gold!"
1,wasted effort,"I was reading the reviews of this CD and agree with both the 5 star and the 1 star. Watson is a truly remarkable and gifted singer. I loved his ""The Voice"" and was looking forward to enjoying this album also. Unfortunatly it was not to be for 2 reasons.Reason #1 - His diction coach needs to be fired. NO ONE rolls their R's like that unless they are trying to learn how to roll the r. Josh Groban figured it out with almost flawless diction. Listen to Granada sung by Placido Domingo to understand what I mean when compared to Watson.Reason #2 - After the diction coach has packed up the producer needs to go. I felt that many of the songs were over produced. By that I mean that some felt that they were movie preludes. Star Wars, The Magnificent Seven, etc. The production of an song or album is suppose to add to the music not take away from itRussell, lose the anchors that dragged this CD down and go back to a previous incarnation. I will carefully preview the next CD before I buy it."
5,You won't be disappointed with this CD,"This wonderful Album reminds us that Russell Watson is still number one in the entertainment business. His powerful delivery is unforgettable as he takes us through songs such as Santa Lucia, The Pearl Fishers' Duet, All or Nothing and a number of other gems.Yet with all his power, he sings songs like Immenso Sogno and Tutto sei per me with a tenderness that shows control and sensitive interpretation. Listen to Core `ngrato and you would realize that this man can make you feel joy, pain and every other emotion that is part of that song.Finally, he deserves to be recognized as one of the Best entertainers this century and his Classical Brit awards each year are a fitting accolade. Don't just take my word for it, purchase the album yourself, and you won't be disappointed."
1,Worst recording that I've heard,I can only give this album a single star as this is the worst album that I've heard. The singing is absolutely unacceptable. Very bad. The singing cannot even produce an even sound. Appalling!
5,Russell's the best!,"I just love watson's voice. Fell in love with it the moment I bought his first album. This album just brings out the best of him. Strong, yet sultry at the same time. Absolutely wonderful!!!"
5,ONE OF HIS BEST ALBUMS,"REALLY ONE OF HIS BEST ALBUMS. IMMENSO SOGNO, LA DANZA, THE LIVING YEARS, CORE `NGRATO, DID YOU EVER.A GREAT, GREAT, ALBUM"
5,"Check it out, you'll be hooked","A primer on how to be fresh and exciting on old favorites. Mr. Watson covers classical material from the popular Neapolitan songs, and with stylish arrangements and bravura performances that make these songs completely his own. And anyone who needs a reminder of just how great this young man is can only check out this CD at the local record store and be hooked as we all are."
5,No regrets.,I certainly have no regrets buying this cd. Russell has done it again. His voice has improved over the years. Fantastic talent to complement great selection of tracks. What more could you ask for??????
5,No misses on this album,"Before this album, I was only familiar with Russell Watson from his brief appearances on a few televison shows. He generally sang ""Va, pensiero"" (Encore). I was in a store not long ago and saw the import Reprise, the 17 track CD, took a listen and I loved it.Naturally, I was VERY happy to see that most of the 17 tracks on this CD made in on to the American CD. There are certainly no misses on this album. One of my favorite songs is ""Tutto sei per me"", which he sings so softly and lusciously. All of the new songs seem to make Russell Watson's voice more sensitive and lovely even more and show another dimension in this fabulous voice.It's definitely worth checking out and this particular CD is the best value for the money."
5,"Not a Watson fan, but appreciate real talent","I didn't buy this CD through a marketing ploy nor am I a Russell Watson fan but I do appreciate talent when I hear it and this guy has talent plus. In my 50 years of listening to many, many singers, Watson is one of the few singers in his ""field"" that has so captured my attention.Like many others, I accidentally saw his performance on public television and immediately was drawn to this unusual and versatile performer. He can sing both classical and pop-rock songs well and is also an exciting performer to watch.Based on this tv performance, I purchased Reprise, USA version and was not disappointed. In fact, this CD brings out even more of Watson's warmth, versatility and excellent voice.I will have to keep an eye on this talented singer."
1,"No talent, no voice, no technique, no encore, no reprise.","Obviously, a lot of the reviewers who gave this album five stars don't have very good musical taste. Why settle for Russell if other tenors out there have the most creamy and delectable voices accompanied by the most gorgeous musical techniques? This album was recorded in bad taste, and Watson gives the blandest renditions of some of the world's most wonderful arias. The man should stick to boyband pop. He doesn't have the kind of vocal beauty or talent to tackle something as grand as opera. Of course, his fans simply were taken by his airhead looks and not his voice."
1,Musically very substandard,"There is almost nothing to praise about this recording. Musically, it is bad. Very bad, actually. Russell Watson has failed to do the music justice, and his strained renditions are unpleasant. He also doesn't seem to know what he is singing, for his delivery is monotonous. One of the worst recordings that I've ever heard."
1,Boooooooo,"I am 18 years old attending a music Conservatory and I can sing this reperatoire better .... not to mention the scores of others who can and have recorded it. Someone explain to me why you listen to this... Its tragic.It is some of the most nasal singing that I have ever heard. Quick, high breaths lead to a strangled and worbling sound. This is confounded by sdome of the loudest and most bombastic orchestration that I have ever heard. Neaopolotan songs are turned into Wagnerian clipps.The most pathetic is an attempts at the arias... very strangles and very weak. There is, however, a solid voice at the core and the odd thrilling high note.Russell Watson is a pop singer, his classical voice is nasal and uncomfortable...."
1,Appalling singing,"This is definitely the worst vocal recording that I've ever bought. Russell Watson's voice is not too pleasant. Unfortunately, his total lack of singing skills renders her performances a complete farce. None of the track here is satisfactory from a musical viewpoint.I will give this one star."
1,What dreadful singing!,"Frankly, the singing here is dreadful. Russell Watson, who, in truth, is not a classical singer, strains his voice to ugliness in order to encompass the notes. The result is singing that is unnatural and without feeling (or without the right kind of feeling).A recording to be avoided."
1,Not real tenor singing,"I'm afraid what is featured here is not real tenor singing. The voice of Russell Watson is too small to be a classical singer. His voice range is too narrow and his top notes too precarious to be called a tenor. Besides, there're other obvious flaws like a shortness of breath, suspicious intonation, unclean attack.As a vocal recording, this is far from satisfactory. In fact, it merely let one knows how not to sing and how much harm a lack of technique and musicianship can do to the music.I can only give this recording at most one star."
5,Russell is fantastic...,Russell has done it again. Sensational album with great choices of tracks. He has matured over the years and this cs deserves 5 stars.
1,Unmusical recording,I'm afraid Russell Watson only offers the looks but not much substance in his singing. This is an unmusical recording in the sense that the performances are not up to vocal standard the the renditions are musically distorting and also charmless. I don't like it at all.
1,Can't recommend to others,"I can't recommend this cd to others. The singing is just too bad. Russell Watson's singing is clumsy and unmusical. He fails to deliver the essence of the music. Such a kind of singing is very disappointing, and even annoying.I think I've already over-evaluated this cd by giving it one star."
1,No good at all,"I'm mystified by the praise accorded to this album. To my ears, Russell Watson's singing is very coarse and unrefined. He has trouble in hitting some of the notes (both high and low) and to maintain a phrase. He glosses over some of the more intricate parts of the music and doesn't attempt to inflect the words or to create any sense of a coherent interpretation.To me, Watson's performances fall so far short of the mark that they cannot be recommended as mature music interpretations. I will award this album only one star."
1,Do no like it,I do not like the singing on this cd. It is so vulgar and coarse. No charm whatsoever.I will give it a single star.
1,Don't find it at all good,"I'm disappointed by this album. First of all, the selection of music isn't that wise. Secondly, the performance of Russell Watson is plainly unsatisfactory - he is unable to infuse a sense of life into the music.Frankly, I have little interest in listening to this album again. I certainly won't recommend it to other people."
1,Sending shivers down my spine,"Russell Watson's singing often send shivers down my spine. The reason is that his vocalism is so haphazard and insecure that I'm afraid his cracking every time he approaches those high notes. I think Watson himself also senses his own technical shortcomings and his top notes are always approached tentatively, often accompanied with a most ugly switch of resonance position.I'm afraid most pop singers (and also members of decent school choirs) are able to singing with more security and artistry than what one hears on this recording."
5,the best singer ever...,"another great album by russell....what a voice!!...and to those people who gave him one star,...it really shows how much you know good music when you hear one...no one should deserve only one star...especially russell....."
5,"An exciting singer, what more can you ask for","A very exciting recording from RUSSELL and a group of great musical conductors. How can anyone miss when you have Watson singing such classics like SANTA LUCIA, GRANADA, AND TORNA A SURRIENTO. Watson is at his best when he sings IMMENSO SOGNO AND TUTTO SEI PER ME, possibly the best songs, RUSSELL has recorded. I almost cried and swooned when he sings the beautiful CORE `NGRATO.Although there are only 13 tracks on this CD, each song is relatively long so that you will get 60 plus minutes of Watson. What more can you ask for?"
5,13 tracks not enough!,"Just about every song here is already a classic, even in the versions here. Still, if you want a nice set of top notch selections condensed on one disc, go no further.Also, some of them are about the best you will ever hear. Immenso Sogno and Tutto sei per me are just the first among all the first rate numbers here plus a beautiful rendition of Core `ngrato.My only beef is that 13 tracks do not seem nearly enough for a CD. Nevertheless, this is very highly recommended for the slightly older prospective fan, who really does not know where to go in picking Russell's Cds.So yes, it is a must buy for that individual!"
1,Recording that deserves no marks,"This terrible recording surely deserves no marks.Russell Watson's performances here are abysmally bad, whether in terms of pure vocalism or interpretation.I certainly won't recommend such a poorly produced cd to anyone."
1,A musical disaster,"As this is an audio recording, I'll only judge this product through the sound that I hear from playing it. Handsome faces play no partly in the assessment whatsoever.So, what did I hear on this recording? Sad to report, I hear a hour of appalling singing and bland performances. Russell Watson, who claims to be a tenor, is evidently not one. His voice doesn't have the amplitude and range for a true tenor. Besides, his technique is so fallible that people who're familiar with the music will worry for him at every turn of the phrase. Unfortunately, such worries are often justified for the number of vocal blunders that Watson commits is legion.I won't recommend this substandard recording to anyone. After all, there're much better cross-over vocal albums in the market. It is not necessary to waste one's money on such a bad product, unless one wants to hear how badly Watson's singing can be."
1,Not recommended,"There are just too many problems with this CD for me to recommend it to others.The singing of Russell Watson is terribly substandard. Not only is his singing stressful and ugly, he probably doesn't know how to interpret the different kinds of music shoved on him by his record producers. As the result, the delivery is effortful to the extreme, robbing the music of its charm and effect.This recording isn't up to par whether in terms of singing or interpretation."
1,A musical failure,"Honestly, I think this album is a musical failure. None of the tracks are properly or even competently sung. In many cases, Russell Watson has simplified the music and ignored the dynamics. Unsatisfactory."
1,Appalling singing,The singing on this album is appalling! Russell Watson cannot even hold a note properly and securely. His performances are mannered and emotionally contrived. They're also technically very defective.Absolutely horrifying musically!
5,just plain beautiful,"1st., I would like to lodge a complaint.My name is Marjorie Moore, and I am from Downey Ca., but someone has attached Lisa Niles name with my add. and she is understandably upset. Please correct this. Thank youRussell watson has no compitition as far as I can tell.I play his music, then play the same music by someone else , and his is so superior there is no comparisonThis new album is no exception- it is the best that music can be."
5,"Brilliant voice, brilliant CD","I am a new to Watson. He is the most exciting singer I have ever heard. Watson has opened the doors of classical music to me as no one else has. Yes, I've listened to the so-called great classical artists but I turned a deaf ear on these somewhat pompous singers.The big surprise to me, however, was that classical and cross-over singers sing classical songs in their classical voices and pop songs in their normal classical or ""cross-over"" voices making it uncomfortable for me to listen to the classical singers sing pop and the cross-over singers trying to sing classical. Not so with Watson. He sings Classical songs in his beautiful and powerful tenor voice and pop and pop-rock songs in his myriad of pop voices, all brilliant.This guy is talented!! Oh yes, this CD is brilliant too! Buy it!"
5,No one does it better than Russell!,"The music world will surely be ""decked"" with Watson's trademark classical interpretations of familiar operatic songs. The artist, backed by a bevy of talented musical conductors, is wonderful as he takes on such standards as ""Santa Lucia"", ""Granada"", ""Torna a Surriento"", and ""La Danza"".However, it is his versions of ""Core `ngrato"" and ""The Pearl Fishers' Duet that show Watson at his most captivating and evocative with his tenor voice. These are the songs that bring the spirit of this musical genre alive.No one does it better than Russell."
5,Truly a first class talent,"I was first introduced to Russell Watson a few years ago on a public television special but it wasn't until of recently when I caught a glimpse of him again on brief spot on the GMA show singing Va, pensiero that got my full attention. I can say that I was impressed with what I heard. Russell Watson can be truly called a multi-talent since that word is being thrown around recklessly with more well known but overrated singers nowadays. When I listen to Russell singing I hear power, emotion and versatility in his voice which I don't really hear with a lot of from male vocalists today.""Core `ngrato"" is my very favorite track off this CD with a close second going to ""Immenso Sogno"". I found it unusual yet compelling to hear Russell Watson's vocals on the ""The Pearl Fishers' Duet. His rendition of ""the Living Years"" is excellent.A terrific album overall as is Russell Watson as a singer. He is truly a first class talent."
1,No good at all,"I've heard a lot of words about the singer, Russell Watson. However, I'm completely disappointed by his singing in this album. His performances are technically substandard and also charmless. I'm bored by his singing. Even my teenage son has expressed disgust at such poor singing!"
1,Worst vocal album I've ever heard,"As the title suggests, I'm extremely disappointed by this album. The singing is of a very low standard. The performances lack charm. Everything is done in a monotonous and unimaginative manner.This certainly is singing at its worst!"
1,An album with little value,"This is a shame. I don't understand why a amateur singer with little voice can be signed up to release an album which contains music that is totally beyond his abilities.Watson's weak voice, which gives lie to the fact that he is a classical singer or a tenor, fails to do any justice to the music. Besides, his performances are boring and colorless, without any sense of life in them.In my opinion, these performances completely misrepresents the music, and give a reductionist and distorted view of the music. In fact, much sublime music is dumbed down by such a cavalier and unprofessional approach.One can only view such a kind of ill-considered and inartistic venture with scorn."
1,Worst vocal release that I've ever bought,"This recording comes as a great disappointment. After all those good things that I've heard about Russell Watson, I'm shocked to discover that this poorly sung album is actually the worst vocal release that I've ever bought!Russell Watson doesn't have a beautiful voice at all. On the contrary, his voice is small in size, limited in range and abrasive sounding. He has little breath control and has to cut the phrases brutally to suit his limited technique.Watson also has no eye for detail, for the many subtle elements of the music and text elude him totally. In treating the vocal lines as mere tunes, he reduces some great music into mere melodies for a crude hour of karaoke.His performances are utterly charmless. I've never encountered a more uncommunicative singing before whether live or on recordings.All in all, an appalling release of little music value."
1,Simply no good,"I don't like this recording at all. The singing is simply no good. Watson's voice is weak and trembly, and his performances are boring. I regret buying this release."
1,From bad to worse,"It is sad and disappoiting to see that a performer has declined rather than matured. Unfortunately, this happens with Russell Watson, whose singing in the latest album is even worse than the previous 2 releases, which are, honestly speaking, already very bad.There has been a clear decline in both the quality or the voice as well as the manner of singing. Although some of the music in this album isn't too difficult, Watson still botches the job. None of the tracks is at all pleasing to the ear, in fact.Why can't the singer make some improvement, no matter how little it may be, before embarking on another recording (and money earning) venture?"
1,Unacceptably bad,"Just what kind of album is this?Although it's meant to be a sort of cross-over album, it doesn't mean that the singing can be that bad! On the contrary, these cross-overs numbers should be delivered with the kind of technical assurance and interpretative charm that are entirely missing here.I can only say that this album is a complete failure. It is diappointing that a major recording company can release an album that is of such low quality."
1,Don't like it at all,"I'll just be short. I don't like this cd at all. The singing is terrible. Poor technique, worn voice, bad musicianship. The performances are lifeless and boring.Not recommended."
1,Seriously flawed,"To be frank, the performances in this album is seriously flawed. Russell Watson doesn't really have the voice to sing this type of cross-over music. His essentially light voice with limited vocal colors often sound uncomfortably strained whenever the music becomes taxing. In softer passages, he is unable to bring forth a variety of tone color, resulting in a musically monotonous interpretation.Things could have been improved had Russell Watson paid more attention to the details in the score. Unfortunately, the singer just charges ahead without acknowledging the musical subtleties. As a result, the performances, besides being vocally unpleasant, fall very flat indeed."
1,Forced and unnatural singing,"I actually felt some discomfort when listening to this album.Russell Watson is not only a crude belter, his forced and unnatural way of singing is very unpleasant indeed.I don't think I'll ever buy another recording by him."
1,Way below expectations,"Having regard to all the hype that surrounds Russell Watson, this recording is way below expectations. The singing of Mr Watson on this cd is monotonous, unfeeling and technically rudimentary. The singer is further unable to convey the different kind of emotions of each song. Such generalised performances are, to be honest, a bore."
1,"""Reprise"" is no Prize","A very poor CD both in choice of music and voice quality. Mr. Watson's voice sounds strained and tired in many of the songs. I was very disappointed and sorry that I purchased ""Reprise""."
1,A parody of tenor singing,"I can't help wondering if Russell Watson is a real tenor. After listening to this cd, my greatest impression is that, what I've heard is a kind of parody of tenor singing. It's very eccentric indeed, like a boy whose vocal cords haven't fully develop trying to imitate genuine tenor singing. The result is grotesque and not at all pleasing. I don't think I'll listen to such and awkward recording for many times...."
1,Poor and unimaginative singing,"This recording is really bad. The singing is poor and unimagination, thus illustrating clearly the technique defects and lack of experience on the part of the singer, Russell Watson.There are many classical and cross-over artists out there who sing much better than Watson. Many look better than him, too. I don't think this substandard recording is competitive at all."
1,Shame to Watson and his record company,"Shame to Russell Watson and his record company! They never should have release anything as substandard as this appalling cd! Frankly, I have never heard any vocal recording that is even half as bad.None of the tracks are satisfactorily performed. All, however, feature absolutely terrible singing that is strident and inaccurate in delivery. One really has to listen to this recording to realise that singing can be as bad as this!An absolutel horror! Not recommended at all."
1,Worst of the three,"Russell Watson has so far produced 3 albums, and this certainly is the worst of the 3.Watson simply cannot even sing competently. There's much musical ""cheating"" involved. Phrases are chopped up, note values unobserved. His voice continues to deteriorate in quality and the high notes, which he can barely reach, sounds awful.Watson's singing lacks any kind of musical style. The performances are unidiomatic and generalised in expression. Very uncommunicative.I can't give this poorly-produced album more than 1 star."
5,Great choice of songs,"I love this Cd, Russell's vocal stylings and phrasings are so unique. The songs make me feel good and put me in a sophisticated mood. I recommend this Cd for all classical and pop enthusiasts.This is one CD I never store away on the shelves. Add it to your record collection and you will be glad you did"
5,One of the best,I never knew who Russell Watson really was until I saw a brief appearance of him on the Bravo Network. He sang a Broadway melody in that performance and I never forgot it.I finally made the move to buy one of his CDs and I don't regret it. I own just a few so I am very particular on what CDs to purchase. Watson just has an amazing voice. He has a true talent for singing and performing. He is one of the best.
5,bravo russell.....,"as usual, russell's voice has swept me off my feet with his new album...especially ""tutto se per me"" with his breathy voice....he's one in a million...."
5,A must-have CD,"Since Russell Watson rarely makes live appearances here in the United States, this CD is a must for all Watson fans and lovers of good music. Reprise, shows Watson at his very best.Most of the songs are Neapolitan classics and the balance are semi-classical songs showing why he is one of the best in his field. I personally wished he had sung a few more pop-rock songs in which he does such an excellent job with his many pop voices. But, for all die-hard Watson fans this CD IS A MUST. You will NOT BE SORRY"
5,Enchanting and brilliant singer,"I recently discovered Russell Watson while a watching Christopher Closeup tape of Russell Watson being interviewed on this religious program. The profile on him behind the scenes concert preparation and glimpse into his personal life was enchanting.I was taken in not only by his personality, his charm and his involvement with humanitarian projects, but by watching brief excerpts of his brilliant singing. I am always on the look-out for a great and emotive vocalists, whatever genre, and Mr. Watson fits the bill.This CD is evidence and reflection of this wonderful human being and singer."
5,Great gluten free biscotti,I am very happy that Pamela's Products makes gluten free biscotti. You would not even know they do not contain gluten. Recommend them highly to anyone liking a nice hard almond anise biscotti great for dipping into coffee/tea.
3,would rate higher,Now I bought these because I wanted to try another brand of biscotti. At first I did not realize they were mainly for a special diet but then went ahead and ordered anyway. I still prefer Nonni's regular biscotti of course but I am sure I would rate these much higher if I was not able to eat regular ones. They are very good for being made special and I am sure people who need to have something like this find them excellent.
3,The Promise,Good movie. Video quality just okay. Product was intact when delivered. Story was great. The price was reasonable and affordable.
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed after seeing the bedding set. Online this set appears to have a satin look and once I saw it in person it appeared to be more flannel in appearance and texture. The picture is very misleading.
5,GORGEOUS baby girl bedding!,"This bed set is gorgeous! It's a million times prettier in person and it's VERY high quality. So cute and elegant! I had no problem with the crib sheet - after washing, it fits perfect. 5 stars!"
4,Moving as well as refreshing,"I always enjoy hearing a new artist and to be able to hear one mature within a single album is a treat. The Bosnian Overture is one that moves me not only to tears, but to awareness as well. I am looking forward to hear more of Mr. Waring very soon."
3,Pleasant music to hear....some better than others,"Overall, I really liked this CD. I thought the music was original, and listeners can definately grasp and enjoy it. I found that some of the pieces like the Bosnia overture, were stronger than the piano concerto. While there is nothing wrong with the concerto overtly, I think the other two overtures are far more original and mature. Reading the liner notes, I noticed that both overtures were completed later, so it seems like this composer was in the process of developing and refining his creations. If I had to classify this music, I would say it reminds me of both film music, as well as music from the late romantic period, like holst, etc. This guy likes to write large, and I look forward to see what comes next from this guy. Worthy CD."
2,An Attempt at History,"I've found this book to be poorly documented, full of unsuported radicle claims and circular arguments. Souri makes no effort to explain what he calls Japan's inherent military and industrial suporiority afer other Asian nations but meerly accepts it as an axim and proceeds to explain it. Add to this a translation that fills to book with convoluted sentances that don't seem to fit well where they are and I found it to be an unplesent experience."
3,"OK collection, but not perfect (but what is?)","I found that the CD was really a good buy, as I was after the Kiss song ""Forever"", and the Whitesnake song ""Is This Love?"". It also has some good tunes like Night Ranger's ""Sister Christian"" (this seems to appear on every 80's CD I buy, but oh well), and a really good Sammy Hagar tune ""Your Love's Driving Me Crazy"".It also has some good tunes by Cinderella, Tesla, and the Scorpions. The only problem I have with this CD is that it has the edited version of Meat Loaf's ""I'd Do Anything For Love"", which is butchered terribly, and sounds out of place from the start (it's my favorite song by Meat Loaf, but it's from 1993, not the 80's). Other than that, it is an overall good sampler.***Note that Alice Cooper is on the cover, but has no songs on the CD; if this is not Alice, then please correct me."
4,Good small textbook,"This is more of a textbook than a guide. It has good examples and a little code, but I was hoping for more code examples and found it only a good companion to my normal textbook,"
1,Worst Matlab Book Ever!!!!,Do not buy this book if you are a beginner. It is not for beginners and is quite antiquated. Material is too complex and the example do not clearly demonstrate how to utilize the basic functions of MatLab.
4,Looks better but isn't all that fabulous,"The shell is beautiful when installed in kitchen. Still a hollow soup can in construction quality with cheap sounding switch gear and flimsy sounding fan. Same materials as cheaper models (resculpted, of course) with a slightly quieter motor. Hoped it would be a bit more substantial (or at least sound it). Non-vent filters don't even snap in (tiny fins keep them in place against aluminum ones). It works and I guess that what matters in the end!"
4,Rangehood review,"Rangehood works well, and not too hard to install. Was greasy inside and so probably not cleaned up well prior to ship. No information provided (manual, etc), but we were able to figure it out."
4,djake,"I love the fan except for one thing. The ridiculous ritual of changing the light bulbs that 3 out of 4 have already gone out in 4 months. Who would think in this day and age it would be so difficult to change a light bulb? Do they want it to become some kind of a joke. How many homeowners does it take to change a Broan light bulb? First you need to make sure you did not throw away the little rubber suction cup that looks like a leftover part from something. And then you get to fight with the light bulb that does not want to come out. Right now I have won the war with one but am fighting with the second which is why I decided to write the review. Hopefully, I will win WWII. I had to engage my husband for the very first light bulb but decided to take these two on by myself. Broan-why did you do this to us? You had a great overhead light and fan until the bulbs went out. I might mention, in my old loud fan, I think I changed the bulb twice in 15 years."
3,Nice Hood,"This is a nice hood but I think that the manufacturer put more emphasis on looks than functionality. The first think I noticed is that it isn't really quite, not at least the way the description indicated. The second think is that if you boil water on the front burners on your range you will need to turn the fan on to full other wise the condensation will accumulate around the lights and drip onto the stove top. But overall at full speed it does a nice job of pulling air away from the cooking surface. The dual lighting system is really nice and the hood is attractive. It looks nice in the kitchen. If I were to buy another I think I would still purchase this one. It works well on high speed and sound isn't an issue for me and I like the styling."
3,Mediocre at best,"It gets *some* of the smoke and grease out, but plenty ends up in the rest of the kitchen. It's not really all that quiet either. In this price range, you are pretty much limited to NuTone or this - I don't know why there are such lousy options."
4,"Quality product, quiet and well made.",Good value for this well made range hood. I'm using it non-vented but it has plenty of draft and is super quiet. The SS finish is top notch.
4,Good Range Hood for the Price,"This range hood is a good purchase for the price. It looks modern in stainless steel. I really love how it updated my kitchen. The hood is quiet in low mode but a little loud on high. It is not disruptive, just a little loud. Overall, this is a great buy."
4,Very Nice,I very much liked this range hood. It is bigger than the previous hood I had and that is a plus because now I can see all of my pots on my range.Lighting is great but fan a little noisy on high but is fine on low.I am very happy with my purchase and the price was a great deal.
5,Very Nice,"After the previous reviews about noise we were a little hesitant to purchaser this unit,but eventually went for it. We have used it for about a month and are really enjoying. The unit is well made, has several options for venting and contrary to other reviews, the noise level is very reasonable for the volume of air moved. We did add blocks under our cabinet to so that it would fit tight against the cabinets and drilled four new holes in the top casing to better fit our kitchens configuration. Overall a pretty simple installation and works as advertised."
3,good value,"i shopped at lowes, and homedepot, they had it listed above $200. this was the best price. easy to install, and works great."
4,Nice range hood,"This range hood definately has a different look to it, one that has my husband confused as to whether he likes or dislikes it. I love it. The hood brings the light up a bit higher than traditional hoods. It has two fan settings and a low/high light settings, along with two lights. We used halogen flood lights and on the high setting it really lights up the entire range and surrounding counter space. Unlike traditional hoods, it has a clean and finished look underneath."
2,"good enough, not great","I was looking for something functional and inexpensive. I got what I paid for. My previous fan did not duct to the exterior, which makes it essentially useless, so my main objective was to correct that. If I were buying a range hood again, I would not purchase one designed for either ducted or non-ducted use. There is a little plastic piece to cover the opening on top of the hood if you are ducting to outside, but it's not particularly effective. As a result, some air ends up recirculating right back into the kitchen. Not so great. I guess I could put tape over the opening, but who wants that? Next time I'd at least get a model designed only for exterior ducting. The hood looks nice enough. Still, function over form for me, hence only 2 stars."
1,Compatability,The drive will not work in a 233mmx without a driver. I could not get it to work in a Celron 266. I thought it would work with my TV.
5,Kindle version is lacking,"The Kindle version of this book has little formatting, no navigable table of contents, and not even chapter breaks. It is one huge text dump. This makes it almost useless for reference purposes. Sadly, this is typical of many public domain Kindle books on Amazon, due to the lack of any minimum formatting standards.Imagine if you bought a regular paper text book, and it was one big unwieldy stream of text without even a paragraph break between chapters. How would you rate that book on Amazon? I gave this the benefit of the doubt for classic content, but if there were separate Kindle ratings, this would be a 2 star effort.If this title interests you, try a different ebook version, or find a paper version."
4,Very Comprehensive,This is an excellent reference book at a very nice price. I gave it only four stars because I would have liked to see the origins of the words included. I teach college chemistry and I'm interested in where the terms came from.
3,Need a longer ribbon cable.,"Needed this for a SFF case. Ended up exiting out between seams in the back of the case, a-la dongle."
4,Good if you need it,Although my LP card actually came with this and I didn't need it at the moment. I have used it since and was glad to have an extra. The brackets seem strong and were a perfect fit. The VGA was standard quality and nice if you need it also.
3,It is what it is,"It is what it is...three pieces of aluminium and an analog cable. The connector did come in handy, although the board side connector had 4 too many sockets for my video card."
4,spare kit,"bough the kit for HTPC, however foound out same back-pannel in the box with video card. so, didn't needed for immediate use, and I'm going to leave it for next cases.quite excessive and redundant.a kind of HDMI connector socket or adaptor would be also useful to have in the same box."
5,Works,"I used this for a card that I upgraded a friends ""CUBE"" Shuttle X PC with. Was immediately obvious how to use the kit and was similarly very easy to assemble things and get them running. This is a great little kit."
4,Computer,This was a great choice to use on the computer where I needed to hold stuff in my friends new case.
5,Very Pleased,"This adapter does exactly what it was intended to do. Only wish it was included with the Antec 900 case as standard equipment. Firewire is far superior to USB and much more versatile. The transfer rate was actually about 857Mbs under extented timeframes versus about 200Mbs for USB under the same circumstances. (As an aside, all new US warplanes have firewire features!)"
3,Stotan!,"Stotan! is a very uplifting story of high school swimmers who battle through adversary. The book focuses on a bond of four swimmers and friends that come to meet tragedy and prejudice. The story itself is very straight forward with little diction and figurative language, but has strong detail and imagery. The main plot of the story is interesting and the book is fairly short, so I would recommend it to someone who does not want to dive into a 600 page novel. Overall Stotan! is a feel good story that shines light on triumph and courage but does not have deep philosophical meaning."
3,"My review of this book is ok, personally don't like it...",I like the books that have the more city setting with real people that are suffering from the hard ships of life. I like teen books that have some violence and a little bit of mystery. I would like to tell people that this book is good for young teens maybe have school rivalry and are on the swim team.
2,Okay for the basics,"I think this book is alright if you want some quick and easy art activities or if you need an introductory worksheet when teaching a certain art element. I am a specialist Art teacher and I very occassionally refer to the book for 'early finisher' activities. But, as a book that claims 'how to teach art to children' it is severely lacking and I did not find any of the 96 projects inspirational. All of the illustrations appear to be photos of adult work (made to look like childrens' work). If you are looking for a book with depth, expert advice and beautiful photos of actual student work - I would thoroughly recommend the book 'Emphasis Art - A Qualitative Art Program for Elementary and Middle Schools'."
4,Handy resource,"I purchased this book for some new ideas for art activities in the college class I teach for elementary education majors. It is nicely arranged by formal art elements with clear, concise directions. While it has worthwhile classroom activities, those concise directions can be a bit thin for most teachers that don't have any art background, unless they are the more motivated type that will do some deeper study into the art elements and principles covered in the National Visual Arts Standards. The one other problem is in the examples pictured in the book, which are obviously done by an adult, and not very imaginative uses of the lessons. Real-live kids would give far better effort than is pictured throughout the text.Overall, this is a nice resource for the classroom teacher."
5,"Great book for teaching the"" Grammar"" of Art","I am using this book as a tool for teaching kids the building blocks, or""grammar"" of Art. The elements of Art are taught chapter by chapter, and are easily grasped when doing the projects, all which are well explained and fairly simple. There are several projects to help teach each element of Art, and the required supplies are inexpensive and easy to obtain. While the kids need to follow the specific requirements of each project, there is plenty of room for creativity.This book does not teach the technical skills of drawing or painting. It is designed to teach the building blocks of art. It will help a child think more about how artists use these elements to draw the eye in to a work of art, and will help them as they create their own pieces. A very good book!"
4,"Good book of ideas for the un-""artsy""","My friend recommended this book years ago, but it was too pricey for me. Finally I gave in and I'm glad I spent the money. The book is easy to follow and the projects are easy enough for a K-1 grade level. Great book."
3,"Great Book, Poor Paper","The pictures in this book are wonderful and fun to color, but the paper used is too thin and anything but crayon or colored pencil shows right through to the next page ruining the next picture! I wish they had spent the extra money on extra thick paper."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this coloring book. The pictures are pretty new-age cheesy and there is so much black print in the pictures that there is very little left to color. It's like a collection of photo-copies of sci-fi/new age prints. Not very appealing, even to a Goddess-loving gal like myself."
4,Loveley and empowering,It feels like being a kid again... intricate and playful. I enjoyed going back to my kid-roots and being nostalgic. This coloring book is a great after work stress buster!
3,Definately not for the young.,My son's girlfriend likes to color just as much as her 7 year old son so I found and bought this on line through Amazon. Wasn't able to see many of the pictures and foundout after she opened it that it had a few naked and explicit pictures of women. Cutebut would not suggest for everyone.
2,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this coloring book for my 15 year old daughter. We all love to color in the summer as just a downtime thing to do. She was shocked by the naked women. I was also surprised as I had not expected that, no review had mentioned it. So it is a fine coloring book, but just be aware of what you are purchasing."
5,Brilliant film based on Fritjof Capra's book,"This film, based on Fritjof Capra's book, 'The Turning Point', does an excellent job of illustrating the interconnectedness of life. The film is so rich and compelling that I gain something new from it every time I see it again.I don't understand why it's not available on DVD yet. I'm sure that many fans of the film, ""What the Bleep"", would also appreciate this classic."
4,Good explanation of our modern day mind set,A little slow but worth watching if you ever wonder why we think the way we do about our world. Read F. Capra's books for more info in this area.
1,pretentious claptrap,"Many people will lavish praise on this movie, no doubt. That's because they're scared others might think them boorish if they call a spade a spade. This is a condescending mess of a movie. Rarely will you see a more arid and pedantic bore hailed as ""high art.""Is it possible to make philosophical heavyweights like Rene Descartes interesting and relevant to modern audiences? Sure. Does this film accomplish this? No. Avoid this one like the plague."
4,Different Perspectives on a World of Problems,"Imagine exploring the many ills of the world from three very different personal perspectives - that of a Poet, a Physicist and a Politician. The conversations can be contrived - as lines go, the actors had a mouthful to memorize. But the meaning and exploration behind the screenplay is fascinating and thought provoking. This is a movie where physicality is secondary, the conversational interaction is engrossing. The setting, on the French coastal island, Mont St. Michel, is sublime and appropriate to the conversation. I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn and think."
5,Brain Candy,"I've been looking up peoples reviews of this movie, and while I agree with some of the detractors that you might want to have a cup of coffee if you try to watch this I find that they are missing the point a bit. I love this film because it gives me a lot to think about and some ideas about alternative ways to look at things. I think if you are comfortable with your ability to make your own decisions about things you should be able to watch this movie without getting too offended. However if you don't like to have some of your perceptions challenged then you might want to steer clear. But really, it's a movie about ideas. Though the characters are confident in their own beliefs I don't believe they are trying to convert the audience per se, just providing food for thought. Others might disagree..."
5,Snap this up,"I have a certain affection for this Zarathustra, because it was recorded when I was one week old, March 8, 1954. I wish I were aging as well as this performance. There is simply no way it sounds that old. And a true virtuoso performance it is. Reiner provides wonderful pacing and balance. It's nice to hear the ""Bourgeois Gentilhomme"" suite, very elegant. Reiner's own arrangement of ""Rosenkavalier Waltzes"" is exhuberant, and the orchestra just revels in it's own virtuosity. They're just having one heck of a time, and so will you. A must for every collection."
4,A NEW METRIC.,"LIVE IT OUT is way oppisite from OLD WORLD UNDERGROUND, WHERE ARE NOW. I LIKE IT. I though i was gonna get a carbon copie of the first album, but i was delightfully wrong. Its a little more band based, not just a girl and her band but a whole band."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"I am a HUGE indie rock fan and I love this CD. I am going to see them in Philadelphia in March, so I bought this Cd to see what they will be playing on tour. I am absolutely pleased with it!"
5,I saw Metric at SXSW by accident but I am a fan now:-),The Metric played at the same venue as Snow Patrol at South by Southwest festival and I was there mostly for Snow Patrol show. But then The Metric gave the amazingly warm and lively show and I became an instant fan. They play with a lot of energy while keeping a very personal and happy atmosphere and there is a beautiful interconnection between band members with cleverly written songs. I would highly recommend this album to anybody who have enjoyed bands like Interpol and Arctic Monkeys.
3,Definately Worth A Try,"I saw the Stones the other day and Metric opened. At first, I thought they flat out sucked, but I have reformed. I listen to a lot of stuff. I love mainstream classic rock, Miles Davis's Jazz, even some of Neil Young's Harvest album, but I never really got into Indie rock. Metric, however, could be something really big.At the concert, they played a bit sloppy, but I still liked Monster Hospital. I came home and looked them up, yes at two in the morning, just out of curiosity. After just listening to the sample tracks, I could tell that they weren't half bad, and I don't listen to Indie.As a classic rock listener and new music hater, I suggest giving this a try."
4,Suburbia-fearin',"The everchanging ""Empty"" revs the voice of the lead singer, straight from Broken Social Scene - while we prepare for an album exciting and compleate. I am married to ""Monster Hospital"" and ""Glass Cieling"" is a sure mistress, but the other songs provide such good noise pollution - and yes, that voice is wonderful and strong - that I don't care about the blunt lyrics. Dancy, strange and suburbia-fearin', the latest of Metric is a shattering album."
4,Beach Book With Brains,This was a quick and entertaining read without being silly. The use of NYC as another character was great and clients were hysterical.
4,Product Photo,The photo for these brake shoes is not accurate. I don't even think the photo shows a brake shoe. Product was fine though.
2,SPECO will not honor the product warranty,I recently purchased this camera and to my surprise I discovered SPECO will not honor the warranty for any piece of their equipment purchased on-line. They only extend the warranty to distributors and according to their customer service organization; distributors don't and aren't allowed to sell Speco products on-line.I wish Amazon would have posted this fact before they offered this item for sale.
4,Very solid camera,"I got this to cover some blind spots around the front and side of our house. Color is real good and grandularity during the day is more than fine. During darkness, the night vision will only reachout about 15-20 ft. in total darkness. Like another reviewer mentioned, a light further out will help cover any weakness this may present. It seems to work well with the PC-4 card. You'll need a BNC cable connector as both ends are female. Having the 60 ft. of extra length is really nice and what seperates it from the other similar cameras in this class. Those only have a few feet which is why they are cheaper. You'll pay about the same with the extension cable that you may need to purchase with it."
3,"Good Price, Fair Product","I had hoped to utilize the infrared features of this camera for night time security at my business. In the daytime, the color is good and the resolution is OK. At night I have found that the range is not as robust as specified and that the scenes are typically dark even though at fairly close range. This is a good low cost camera for fully or moderately lit locations."
4,Great little camera,"Recently put in four of these little beauties around my property, and attached them to a four channel DVR with motion detection. The camera's work great, a little difficulty with matching the wiring to the DVR. Overall good camera. Not the greatest resolution. Night vision with at least 30 feet, note fixed focus.Good camera for the money."
1,PATHETIC,"As stated in previous reviews, this movie was very predictable and so disgustingly politically correct that it will make you want to shut it off if you have HALF a brain. Filled with cliches, you will neither be on the edge of your seat, nor even remotely intrigued by Gibson's typical ""mad-because-of-loved-ones-death"" character. I mean, we've seen this ten times before, ala Lethal Weapon II, Braveheart, etc... I finally shut the movie off when Gibson's son walks up to one of the main ""bad guys"" after he's shot him to ""make sure he's dead""- only to have the villian turn around with the typical concealed back-up weapon and stab the idiot! I mean, who in the heck walks across a field to check on one man in battle when muskets are going off all over the place?!?!? Don't even rent this film."
1,Rip Off,The person selling this used book ($59 for a $15 book) is a rip off! Go to PRIMA GUIDES on-line and order an e-download for about $10. Screw profiteers!!!
1,Prima's Worst Strategy Guide,"Skies of Arcadia Legends: Prima's Official Strategy Guide is horrible. The information is not only incomplete, but incorrect. The author even mispelled many words and made up many more! The first impression of quality is soon lost when reading the first paragraph. Prima ussually writes very good and in depth strategy guides, ussually. For this one ignor Prima's good reputation and dont make the mistake of bying it."
3,"Pretty average, wheres the length???","I would also like to add a nother mistake made by the guide. During the second boulder chase in the red moon stone temple, the guide tells to to take a left turn to a chest, but instead it tells you to take a right... Not good. Guides should be solid with no errors. The depth of the guide aint too great either. If Brady Games were to do the guide, it would have been much better."
3,El diario de un borracho,"I think this album is ok, but this artist has lots of high quality music that Amazon.com should try to acquire to offer to their customers, a lot of the new artists such as Carlos Vives and many others have influences from this musician; please try to get more titles."
3,Mostly a decent CD,"I wonder how many people saw the ad for this CD on TV and ordered it right away without looking further into the contents. Brightman? Bocelli? Pavarotti? Florez? Watson? All Three Tenors? All on one CD? Sounded like a winner in the ad. They don't mention the Main Title from Star Wars. Nor do they mention (even Amazon doesn't show it!), that Anne Sofie Von Otter's performance is actually a duet with Elvis Costello, who simply does not have the chops or vocal gifts that most of the other artists on this CD are blessed with. In fact, that song is positively dreadful, and it's all because of Costello's vocally-strained style. What the hell is he doing on this CD? The rest of this CD is generally fine, but certainly do not expect a CD full of classical music, and be prepared to skip song #2 every time you play the CD."
1,Loses time,You have to reset the time every night before you go to sleep because it constantly loses track of time!
3,Sonic BOOOOOM!!,"I love the alarm clock and it does get me up in the morning, I just wish it had a few more options and that it didn't look so cheap because it wasn't! I recommend this product to anyone who does want to piss off their roommate. Also, be prepared to wake up scared shitless the first morning or two after you set it up."
3,still can't wake up,"This clock is wonderful for the medium type sleeper. My son can NOT get up on his own with ANY type of alarm clock including his ipod connected to an amplifier! I bought this clock to try. It initially does wake him him, however, I should have gotten one with a ""dual"" alarm. He forgot to put the sound on once and only used the vibration system under his pillow. It did wake him, however, he went right back to sleep. The sound is very loud and I can hear it in the other room. Just not good for the sleeping dead!"
2,"Great Product, While It Lasts","I love this alarm clock, but I've been through two of them now.The buzzing alarm consistently works, but about a month or two after the warranty expires, the shaking feature stops working and I'm late to work. If you are looking to use this product for more than a year, I'd shop elsewhere. I'm partially deaf and this company is really frustrating.Anyone with recommendations for me can send them to tuesdayismyfavorite@gmail.com!"
2,alarm clock,"I previously had a Sonic Boom that gave a strong vibration and loud alarm. Tried this cheaper one. The power cord is removable, and comes loose when handling to set time, and wipes off what you set. You have to turn over to use switches, rather than program while it sits on surface. It is not as loud, and vibration not as strong. Should have paid extra to get the best."
3,"Loud, but cheaply made","I bought this alarm for my elderly mother who just can't hear the average alarm clock. The alarm is quite loud and will wake her. She had been quite embarassed about missing or being late for appointments. She didn't think she would use the vibrating feature, but has tried it and found it offers reassurance against sleeping throughnthe alarm.What isn't so good are the very small buttons and switches used to set the time and alarm. They are so small that settingbthe time or alarm can be difficult especially for someone with less than perfect vision or dexterity. The product is OK for the price, but is a bit on the light and flimsy side."
1,Lemony!,"Dead on arrival. The display flickers, the clock acts erratically, many functions don't work right. Looks like I got a lemon. I could re-order, but this speaks to poor manufacturing to me. I'm gonna grab the smaller version which I used to have and which worked great."
1,Great if only it worked,Only alarm clock to wake me up so I was very pleased with it UNTIL it quit working. Unfortunately the lack of warranties offered on Amazon leaves me with a piece of junk.
3,Works but cheaply made,"Excellent in what it is designed to do. However, the base is too small and tips over VERY easilly. The overall construction is very lite duty, you must be careful with it. I am going to glue the base to something more substantial. Other than that works great."
4,"really loud, easy to read and set","You may want to buy this alarm clock only if you really have difficulty waking up. The SB300 Boom could be over-kill if you are a normal riser. Its really meant for someone who is hard of hearing, etc. The vibrator is cool, but I haven't needed it. I love the large display and ease of clock and alarm setting."
1,Not worth a dime...,"This clock does shake the bed when the alarm goes off but it feels more like a good massage than a wake-up call. The sound of the alarm is lower than that of my prior ""standard"" electric alarm clock. I want to return it but can't find the receipt."
5,Great Clock,I bought this clock for my son. He loves it. The alarm is super loud and vibrating alarm is wonderful for when you don't want to wake others up. It was a good price and shipping was super fast. Very happy with product and shopping experience!!!
3,I have ordered this brand before (awesome) but this one I got isn't working right,These Sonic Boom alarm clocks are wonderful but the one I got doesn't have a bed shaker that works. I need to call the company and see what to do.My son has one of the round sonic boom clocks and uses the bed shaker. It always gets him up. My nephew doesn't like to get up in the morning for college but he DOES with the little round sonic boom! The alarm is annoying but works!I love the clocks but ordered this one for my mother in law and the shaker isn't working. Will deal with that soon!
2,Powerful alarm but does not keep time,"The alarm in this clock is VERY loud and the bed vibrator also VERY effective. It will wake up the dead, no problem there, however, physically it is cheaply made and worst of all it drops time. This is a real problem because if the clock does not carry the correct time, it will not wake you up when you want, which defeats the purpose for buying such a powerful alarm in the first place. I still use it because the alarm is so powerful but I have to continually try and figure out the difference between the clock's time and what the real time will be and then set it. Also, be very careful to always remember to select either the AM or PM when setting the alarm, otherwise this will cause you a lot of grief."
4,WORKS GREAT once you get a hang of it,"The vibrating alert is excellent. I put the buzzer under my mattress pad and wakes me even though i can hardly hear without my hearing aid. The buzzing sound is terrible, but then again, it is volume and bass adjustable. My biggest gripe is the tall vertical design and the fact that it is nearly impossible to use without scratching the heck out of your furniture. Its tall and the base is very narrow, so it tends to get pushed over easily. Once you get a hang of it, its fine. I wish they made a version of a normal alarm clock style with a vibrating alert. I don't even use the audible alert since the vibrating alert is enough to wake me up. For anyone hearing impaired like I am, I highly recommend it."
1,Doesn't Tell Time,"I got the Sonic Boom alarm clock because I'm in college, and I wanted to be able to wake myself up without waking up my roomate. Unfortunately, it didn't work. It kept on gaining minutes, and then hours once I set the time. Don't buy this clock -- it won't tell time accurately! It's now sitting in my trashcan!"
4,Sonic Boom rocks!,"We got this alarm clock for our 88 year old dad for Christmas. He sleeps without his hearing aid, so is quite deaf. The Sonic Boom alarm would wake the dead! The large display of numbers is great for the elderly who often don't see well, especially since he sleeps without glasses, too. The only problem with it is that the buttons for setting the alarm are very small to see and too difficult for dad's 'bear paws' to be able to set it for himself. If Sonic Alert fixes that problem, this clock becomes the 'user-friendliest' wake-up call for elders."
4,good alarm clock,I bought this for my kids. they can sleep through loud noises. The alarm is not really loud enough to wake them but the vibrating disk I put under the matress does.
3,Great but poorly made,"I am hearing impaired AND a very heavy sleeper, so I bought this becauseI can sleep through auditory alarms no matter how loud they are or how far across the room I have to walk in order to turn it off. It worked perfectly. If you are hard to wake up and normal auditory alarms don't work, I would definately recommend this product or at least a product of this type.HOWEVER I bought the thing in December and it broke in March. The design is quite flimsy. I really wish more mainstream, high quality companies made vibrating alarm clocks because this was simply not a reliable product and was too cheaply made.Buy it if it is the only thing that will wake you up, but purchase with caution."
2,It's not 113 db,"I'm a heavy sleeper, this clock is advertised as 113 decibles and it is nowhere near that, but it is louder than the regular store bought alarms. I can still sleep thru it."
3,not loud,"this really isn't a very loud alarm clock, the other one I used to have is much louder; however the vibrating pad is a good feature and helps me get out of bed."
4,"Alarm annoying, but really NOT LOUD","I wanted the windows to rattle. Not so. The ringer is annoying, but not any louder that any other alarm clock.The bed/pillow thingy, that thing is EXCELLENT. It will literally rock the dead. It vibrates violently.I would have given this product five stars HAD the alarm been louder.As advertised, I know no sonic boom was possible, but I wanted more that a muted squeek."
5,Does the job!,I bought this item for my almost stone deaf father. He has found it to be very effective at waking him up.
3,"Did not care for it--buzzer annoying, vibration a little too 'sonic.'","I just received this clock and am returning it right away--not because it doesn't work, but because I find the alarms very annoying. The vibrating pad vibrates VERY hard--which I think is great for some customers, but too much for me. The buzzer is what really annoys me. It's a single electronic tone that drills into my brain, even when the volume is set on low. Probably what some people are looking for, but not me."
5,Love It!,"I bought the alarm clock for my daughter, who slept through every alarm clock she's ever had. The Sonic Boom does the trick, she wakes up when it goes off. Honestly, I think it could wake the dead, LOL"
5,Mission Accomplished!,"I have tried for years to find an alarm clock to wake my son up.He is now in college and told me he was using 3 alarms to wake up. He said the alarm on this clock was very annoying, which was music for my ears, and since he sleeps on his stomach he found it more helpful to put the vibrating disc under his chest or shoulder and it startles him awake.I bought a second one for my husband so he would quit complaining about my snoring. He now sleeps with earplugs and the vibrating disc under his pillow and the audio alarm off so it will not wake me up. This clock has been what my family has needed for years.It does appear to be made cheaply but do not let it fool you, it gets the job done."
1,RMA'd Junk,"Pros:It arrived on time!Cons:The alarm wasn't loud, maybe 30db.The AC adapter wasn't built into the clock.The product felt cheap. ie. VERY THIN plastic.The price was way to high."
1,Earthquake Simulator,"I am writing this review from the standpoint of wanting a silent vibrating alarm that would not wake my partner up.This vibrates pretty close to an 8 on the Richter scale. It will wake anyone up, not only in the bed, but probably in the room. It is so violent, that it is actually difficult to hold while it's vibrating. It would be perfect, if the manufacturer had thought to make the vibration intensity adjustable, but they didn't think that far ahead.If you have tremendous difficulty waking up, this will probably work for you. In fact, I think that this would wake up someone in a coma.Another big problem is that it is quite difficult to turn the alarm off. There is a cumbersome sliding switch on the side that you aren't going to want to wrestle with when you're trying to wake up, and the clock is very thin and high, so you will likely knock it over, regularly, while trying to turn it off."
2,Poor Image Quality,"These do work to effectively give you a much smaller minimum focusing distance, thereby increasing the size of your image. But it comes at a very high cost in image quality. The Image degradation increases substantial between the +1 to the +4 Diopters, with the +1 being fairly usable, and the +4 being total junk. On the plus side, the case is nice. I am considering dumping the diopters at home, and putting my other filters in the case."
4,Great all-around scope,"I had read previous reviews and noted that the soft case was not included. Nevertheless, after quite a bit of research I decided to purchase this scope at the price. It is a great scope for viewing and digiscoping. So far, I haven't purchased an adapter, but have managed some great bird shots with my cheap digital camera. The scope is better than I expected, perfect for someone shopping on a budget. Yes, it gets a little fuzzy at the highest magnification and there's some chromatic aberration on hot days/long distances, but I'm entirely content with my purchase."
4,Solid Collection,"While there are a few great stories, most of the stories are simply average. The range and variety is what gives the collection some charm"
5,The Best Anthology of Contemporary Fiction to Date,"This is the best anthology of contemporary fiction. It presents stories that are the best kind of stories: stories with strong ideas executed well. These are not the idea-free duds of the Best New American Voices series, nor the snoozefest ""technical perfections"" of the Best American general selections. Instead, there's one fantastic story right after another. Mercifully, the few misses in here are short enough to forgive, and there's otherwise no real failures (some pieces are impenetrable, but still fun), and there are many whopping successes, care of George Saunders, Wells Tower, Rick Bass, Padgett Powell, Mary Caponegro--scads of others. It's through and through a stunning and enjoyable--let me repeat, enjoyable, a word too often forgotten in contemporary fiction--collection of short stories."
2,Uneven,"Some of the stories and essays in this book are quite good, but others defy understanding. Save your money and time and select ""Best New American Voices"" or one of the other short story collections."
3,Too Long for Small Wrists,"These are good watchbands but if you have small wrists, it will be too long. The extra linksare easy to remove, but putting the watchband back together is NOT. I bought a band online sinceit seems that no stores carry watchbands anymore, and many jewelers don't sell them anymore either. They want to sell you a whole new watch. Since they don't sell watchbands, they don't shorten them either, so you end up having to try to do it yourself. In spite of websites with instructions, doing it yourself is an exercise in frustration. I spent $10 on this band and $5 in shipping, and I now have a useless watchband in three pieces. I am normally good at repairing things, I've even repaired my own computer, but this little watchband is a stumper!"
4,Chapin Poly Foamer / Sprayer Saves the day,The 1 Gallon Chapin Poly Foamer / Sprayer is a great tool for foaming behind wall voids and behind baseboards. It's a versitile tool for any homeowner.
3,Calazeze Maxi Single of 2005,"I order the cd from Amazon I had never heard about him much but when I put in the system, I heard some bombing sounds, not a bad CD. I suggest that you buy you a copy."
4,Dependable effectiveness,"Whenever my skin gets out of balance with whatever, these rhythmic night conditioner ampules by dr hauschka are a dependable item to bring back balance and glowing healthy vitality to my face. However, they are no longer available in glass ampules only plastic ampules so it is a less clean product bringing the rating down to 4 stars."
1,Waste of money,"I'm a Dr. Hauschka junkie....I own the cleansing cream and milk, the toner, the rejuvenating mask, the rose day cream and I love it all!!! So, naturally, I decided to try out this rhythmic night conditioner, despite how expensive it was. Not only is it a hassle to use with the little plastic capsules where you twist off the top and pour the liquid into your hand, but I didn't notice any difference in my skin at all. I might as well just have been putting good-smelling droplets of water on my skin. What a waste of money, time and energy. Use the money to buy yourself something better instead."
3,I really like the Hauschka line.,"I'm not sure if this is doing anything or not. I am really loving the Hauschka line, everything I've bought seems to be excellant quality and very effective. Although I'm not sure this is not working, it may not be an item that does much other than preparing your skin for use of the line. That being said, I have not broken out (which I tend to do) and my skin is reacting very positively to the rest of the line. Not sure I will re-purchase this product yet. I would have given it 4 stars, but for the price, I would like to see some more positive results."
5,Squirrels baffled,"I have had this pole for nearly a year now, and have yet to see a squirrel beat it. A year ago I was just about ready to quit feeding the birds as the squirrels had pretty much taken over in my yard. They destroyed bird feeders--both plastic and wood, baffles, went through over 300 pounds of black oil sunflower seeds and I can't even begin to total the suet they ate. Since I put up this pole, they have not touched a feeder or feed other than what falls on the ground--and that, they are welcome to clean up.The pole is even more sturdy than I expected it to be and I do hang a total of eight feeders on it. If I had another spot for it in my yard I would definitely buy another one."
4,"14 months - no squirrels, but now rusting...","Ww love this pole and it allows us to use cheaper feeders without the risk of squirrels getting to them - but now, 14 months after install it is rusting in many many spots. The coating is peeling off in chunks. Need to scrap it down and spray paint I guess now. The function of the pole works great - just thought it would last longer without needing upkeep.Update:2 years after purchase we did have to scrape entire pole down and spray paint the entire thing. Pole itself still functions well and no squirrels are getting to my cheap feeders - but I do hate scraping and spray painting."
4,Very sturdy and well built,"If you're tired of the flimsy poles that lean over due to a medium weight feeder, you'll like this one. Here are the pros and cons as I see it.Pros:1. Well build from heavier steel than normal (2 inch pipe).2. Works for Squirrels as advertised.3. Plenty of spaces to hang various feeders (8 hooks provided).4. Screws into ground from 18 to 24 inches.5. Has not been defeated by coons.Cons:1. Can see where rust may be a problem.2. A little expensive.3. Assembly instructions are poorly worded and illustrated.3. Certainly not deer proof (but not advertised as that).We're enjoying it even in the dead of Winter in Central TX.Overall we are very pleased."
5,"Yes, It Works...",This product really does keep squirrels from getting to the feeders by climbing but of course it needs to placed where the squirrels can't jump over the baffle. That's the way it is designed and intended to work. I have many squirrels but have yet to see a squirrel even try to climb up the pole. It is very good quality and I had no trouble with assembly but you will probably need to use a post-hole digger in order to get it far enough into the ground.
5,It Works!,"The Squirrel Stopper Pole really works. That is possibly one of the best things you can say about a product. It does what it was made to do. We had four nasty squirrels that just got out of hand and would empty a large bird feeder in one day. Now the seed lasts for a week. That means the Squirrel Stopper Pole will pay for itself with all the seed saved instead of getting wasted on those nasty ""tree rats""Now that the birds are no longer being chased away by squirrels, more colorful birds are coming to the feeder.The Squirrel Pole is made of strong metal. AssembLy was quick and easy. The threaded ground support holds the Squirrel Stopper Pole securely in the ground.We added hanging flower baskets and extra bird feeders. The birds could not be happier and so are we."
1,Will not withstand the force of deer. Remove feeders at night.,Deer pulled on feeders until the pole bent at the weakest point. Only use if you can remove the feeders at night. $130 in the trash. Not worth it.
5,Bird Watcher,"I just put my new bird feeder in my yard this past Sunday and I LOVE IT! It was easy to set-up (with my brothers help) AND the best thing is...the squirrels can't touch it!!! I would highly recommend this bird feeder if you are tired of feeding the squirrels all that expensive bird food. I intend to keep my squirrels fed w/corn cobs, etc., but my bird seed will be for the birds! This bird feeder looks very nice in the backyard and you can hang from 4 to 8 feeders from it (or flower baskets, etc.) One note of caution - when you insert the pole in the base of the corkscrew pole to twist it into the ground, be careful you don't damage the pole that you inserted because it's one of the poles you will hang a bird feeder from. If that sounds confusing, just read the directions and you will understand."
2,Missing hardware/no response!,"How can I rate it? I am missing 14 pieces of hardware for it! Emailed the company two days ago; no response. Called the customer care number on the instruction page AND website. The two times someone answered over a period of three days and probably ten tries, she said it was not the number and she wasn't with JAKA Holdings, Inc. Funny, I double checked my phone log against the printout and they matched.HELP! I don't want to return the SquirrelStopper, I just want to be able to put it together and up!"
1,Rusted and Collapsed,"This item installed easily and kept squirrels from a ground assault. Squirrels did launch successful aerial assaults from trees ten feet away. Proper positioning is essential. The primary problem is the rust. The pole collapsed as my wife was maintaining the feeder hanging from one side. She narrowly missed being hit by the pole as it fell; it could have caused considerable injury. We purchased and installed it 19 months ago; it was rusted at every connection, paint peeling. It dismantled easily as it crumbled apart - I'm glad I had a tetanus booster recently. Do not buy this, someone is going to get hurt."
5,FANTASTIC!,"This crazy winter we lost the large branch on our spruce tree which held our feeders, so I purchased this. I really think they did a great job constructing a product that was sturdy and easy to assemble. I placed it carefully near, but not too near to my spruce tree. Since my birds were used to the old set up it took some time before they came back, but they are all here again. I do get a kick out of watching the squirrels trying to figure out how to get on; they can't. I do see some areas that look like they will be prone to a bit of rust, but I feel that is a limit of the material. I love that the bird droppings wash off in the rain. All in all I think this is a great product."
2,Read all the reviews,"I wish I had read all the review BEFORE I ordered this. Evidntally it is great if you place it 10 feet from your house and your yard is a wasteland devoid of trees. The areas 10 feet from my window are wooded. I already have squirrel-proof feeders that the racoons defeat by climbing up the pole and scoooping out the seed without putting any wieght on the tension bar. Maybe what it needs is a spike on top to prevent jumping from trees.For $125 I'd expect all the holes for be properly drilled, so that one could insert all the screws also."
2,I love the Reggae Rocks CD,"I love the Reggae Rocks CD. It combines music from such groups as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Green Day with reggae greats like Steel Pulse, Big Mountain and The Mighty Diamonds. After listening to the CD I don't think I'll ever go back to listening to the original tracks."
3,A Casstte Would have Sufficed,"This one was a disappointment. It does indeed narrate some interesting Irish myths and legends. That's about all it does, however. The narration is the only worthwhile part of the DVD.This is not to say that it does not contain some beautiful scenery or that some of the music is good. Both statements are true but they are not the stuff of great DVDs. That's a shame. This could have been done so much better.The format is simple. A narrator tells tales while the screen shows scenes of countryside and occasional castle and with some Irish music playing in the background. The background music comes to the fore during long pauses between stories and during pauses within individual stories. All the while, the scenery continues on.I would have preferred a book for the scenery and a simple cassette would have sufficed for the stories."
2,Ultimately falls flat,"This is a fine example of a great concept falling flat. Basically you have an Irish narrator telling different tales of Irish folklore. He does so in a jovial manner with a brisk Irish accent.Meanwhile, all we see on the screen are shots of countryside, castles, and occasional revelers in a pub or somewhere.Although the stories are interesting, the scenery is lovely, and the music is enchanting, none of it really seems to fit together. And it definitely is not conducive to an enjoyable DVD watching experience.I agree with the reviewer who said a book of photography and a CD of stories would have served the same purpose, and probably would have been more enjoyable becuase you could control which pictures to look at when you wanted. This DVD is really not worth watching unless you're very very interested in Irish folklore and have nowhere else to go to hear stories."
1,Screen protector sucks,"I bought this thinking the screen protector was built into the case so that when I pulled out the iPod to view movies I would have a clearer screen. In fact the screen protector is a little gummed piece of plastic that picked up a cat hair before I could put it in place and had bubbles I could not get out. Also the case is so tight I can't see the screen protector lasting more than a week or two. As if that weren't enough it's too thin to offer more than minimal protection. There are large openings on the bottom and back that seem to defeat the purpose of having a case. I returned this and got an Agent 18 VideoShield Kit instead. Not only does it provide much better screen (and overall) protection, it has an adjustable viewing angle."
3,"Nice, but not protective","The case is very nice, but it is not what I would advise for protective travel in an already crowded briefcase. The screen protection is just a thin sheet of plastic."
4,Comfortable,"The underwear are quite comfortable, not the riding, uncomfortable type. However, they do not fit as the model shows them so gracefully. They are not sexy in any way. For that reason alone, I give it 4 stars."
4,Great Gonzo - What a Mystery!,"If the great Dr. Hunter S. Thompson ever took to writing detective fiction, this is how it would most likey read. Crumley's P.I. Milo Milodragovitch is back from his best written work, ""The Wrong Case."" This story is far more violent and drug addled than the previous Milo adventure, and that weakens it somewhat. But its still a hell of a fun ride. Crumley's prose at times remind you of the Dr.'s ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."" Given that Milo also haunts the West, this is an apt analogy. Overall, this is an exellent hardboiled detective fiction novel that is not for the faint of heart."
2,Dragovitch sways and swaggers,"Detective Milo Dragovitch sways and swaggers through James Crumley's ""Dancing Bear"" bracing himself with snorts of coke and shots of peppermint schnapps. When the good guy is this dysfunctional and abrasive, it's hard to get much perspective on the rest of the characters who seem to be glaring foils and stereotypes.The story itself is violent and dark, a multilayered mystery without a lucid or ultimately satisfying solution. It's up to the reader to make a number of leaps of faith to keep things moving. For instance, Milo seems to know instinctively when he is being tailed but how me knows is never quite clear. He is being manipulated but one is never quite sure why or sure how he escapes the consequences of renegade justice.I read ""Dancing Bear"" to pass a rainy weekend but am not inclined to recommend the book."
2,Not a happy person,"Hello,I have returned this item in the hard bound version over three weeks ago. I also have contacted Cutomer Service and get an email in return stating that it is not the correct email address. When I do finally get to the correct email address I get a reponse that they have not located my package and they will contact me when they do and begin the process. It has been too long and I would like to know where my package is and when will the refund process begin. This is a $114.00 textbook and I am a student. Please let me knnow as soon as you can about this issue.Thank you, Jennifer Phillips"
3,Just what you'd expect,"And that's not a bad thing at all. This cd features former Rob Zombie guitarist Riggs and really doesn't stray too far from that of his time in the Zombie camp. It's probably not going to come as a suprise, but this pretty much sounds like 'the next' cd. The cd consist of very Zombie sounding tunes that will be welcome to many's ears. The cd seems to be very heavy on samples, especially in ""Pornstarshampion"" which samples Queen's ""We will rock you"". The cd doesn't seem to focus so much on monsters like zombie's cds seem to do lyric wise, but more towards the sleazy side of things, I mean, let's face it, Rob Zombie's Music is basically 'music made to strip to' and I think this cd acknowledges that and very much wants to be spun up in that rotation. I can even picture some Manson fans getting into this, either or. It's a fun cd for fun times, I'm giving it a 3."
4,So what's the big deal...,"The cast from the Rob Zombie Band got tired of waiting, would you blame them? Riggs (gtr & vocals) decided he could do what his boss did, fun music infested with the zombie love...guess what? He nailed it, with the help of some friends ie. The Tempesta Brothers and John Dolmayan.Blah...Blah...Blah...Love Songs for the New Millenium is packed with familiar sounds, sights and smells that rob zombie once offered before finding himself behind the lure of the big screen . The tracks are solid and dirty, "" I am the scum"" shows they are dead serious about wha they're doing and of course ""Get your dead on"" is spinning out of control in Fuse, Mtv and othe video channels, proving that there's still an audience wanting more fun, gore-filled industrial metal out there."
5,Go - Go Music to beat all the rest!,"This was a highly anticipated release, cause it's the brain child of xRob Zombie guitarist Riggs. The band also features members of POWERMAN 5000 & Rob Zombie's band & WHITE ZOMBIE. The music is some what similar to Rob Zombie's sound, but contains more grittier & stomping beats. The music is a bit heavier as well. I really liked this album a lot & am anxious to see them on tour. These guys are better than Rob Zombie's band! This disc is great & deserves much attention! The vocals are a mix between Metal, Industrial & almost horror go-go styles!!!"
2,Not sure about this one,"Scum of the Earth......I guess it's ok. Its more like a cheap knock off of white zombie(and yes I know the guitarist was in wz) without rob zombie, but mimicking him the whole time???? There was a couple of tracks that I thought were ok, but I don't really spin this after hearing it actually."
3,Simple equipment and that it makes what is its aim.,"It is an interesting device for use in humans, as stimulating of points of acupuncture and for the treatment of the Trigger Points. But it has relatively short useful life. I go also to test in animals, therefore I am veterinarian acupuncturist…"
4,Enjoyable!,"This was a reread for me. I am usually not a fan of anthologies... They always seem so rushed to me.I am not going to summarize each story as I'd give most of the story away.This book contains 6 stories by 6 different authors. Each story averages about 50 pages, give or take. I think it's very good. Each story is unique and different. And I didn't feel like any of them were rushed. I think this book is nicely written and each story is beleivable, despite it's 50 pages. All of the ""couples"" were either long time crushes finally coming together, or coming together again. I liked that part, it helped make the stories seem more real.My 2 favorite stories were by Lori Foster and Erin McCarthy.This is a quick, fun read. Be sure to check your book shelves though before buying it, it was originally released in 2005, same title, purple cover."
3,Note to aviation buffs on Ace's planes,"The principal aircraft used by the fictional Int. Airways is the Martin 130 flying boat, with an occasional shot of a Sikorsky 42 edited in. I don't know my biplanes enough to identify the other principal aircraft used on the airfield, but aerial dogfight and bombing sequences use a whole mix of biplane types from WW1 up until the serial was made in 1936, some of which came from stock footage. I found myself liking the serial more than I thought that I would."
5,Bernaise is best Bernaise I have ever tasted,"I have not bought this Delouis sauce from Amazon, but instead from my local specialty grocer in the refrigerated section, so I am not sure how it can be purchased online. However, my wife and I both agree that the Delouis Bernaise sauce is the best we have ever tasted, and that includes the Bernaise sauces we have tried at high-end steak and chop houses. In fact, we like this so much better than the Bernaise sauces we find in fine restaurants that we stopped ordering Filet Oscar out. This Bernaise sauce, coupled with a prime filet and some crab meat on top has blown away many a guest at my dinner parties.Yes, it is tart compared to the typical Bernaise sauce served at restaurants, but it is this distinctive tartness that makes it better (in our opinion). If you are one who prefers vinegary barbecue sauce to sweet, you would probably like this sauce very much.I cannot opine on the Hollandaise, as I have never tried it."
4,"Alita falls in love, and gets her heart broken","Tears of an Angel - Alita falls in love with Hugo, a young dreamer who will do anything to reach the utopian city of Tiphares. Will the tears of an angel save him from himself?"
5,the complete book of water healing,"I got this for my son when he told me he'd hurt his ankle while in the wilderness, took off his boot and sock and put his injury in a cold stream. worked like a charm.I hope he learned more from this book. I told him when/if he's ever finished with it, could I have it back. -claire-"
3,Its good but a bit simple,"The idea is great but the book is a bit simple, out of the hundreds of complaints the cure is all the same wash in water with a differing duration. I wish it had a bit more background and content."
1,pharmacology made easy for NCLEX-PN,"I found this publication very unhelpful. I was trying to find something that would give me a list of drugs to know for the test, their action, side effects, nursing precautions. Like a nursing drug handbok, but narrowed down to only drugs necessary for the PN test. This book has a review of drug classifications and what they are used for, and then goes on to practice questions about specific drugs, which are not reviewed. I am familiar with classifications, but have a hard time remembering all the drug names and side effects. This book did not help me with that info and was a waste of my money."
3,poor quality scan,Another addictive Ashes book. A bit repetative from earlier works. The scan quality for the Kindle is very poor in places.
4,"The editing is horrid, but it's extremely addictive!","Johnstone should fire his editor, or bother to run a grammer check and spelling check, but the Ashes series is addictive. The blatant knocks of our current situation touch a nerve with many people who are tired of this wishy-washy world. The plot is thin, but you still have to keep turning the pages. It's an addiction you will want to hide!"
3,ALONE IN THE ASHES,I AM READING THIS BOOK NOW AND WILL BE FINISHED SOON. I KNOW I WILL BE PLEASED WITH THE READING AS I THINK THIS WHOLE SERIES IS VERY INTERESTING.
5,Alone In The Ashes,"Great book and great story with a great action sequence. Characters are well thought out and sequence of events is riveting.Hey, I am writing a few year's of revies. This stuff is tedious, so give me a break."
4,Alone in the Ashes,"The reality portrayed is almost chilling with the exception of the one man army/ mcgiver stereo-typing. As you read, Johnstone's style allows you to become a member of his rebels team, misfits, brainiacks, hardheads and the normal people all serve to try to redevelop America after the disasters of the world leaders ignorance and attitude result in nuclear holocaust.People band together to fight against the challenges and rebuild a life.I have faced destruction and disruption of my life due to forces of nature, Johnstone captures the emotion and reaction of people faced with an unclear future and hardship to survive as I have experienced.this series is can't put down fictional reading."
4,Continental bike tires,Delivery was timely - I did get a surprise when I was charged delivery charges (thought the charge for items over $175 was free) and I was also surprised at the amount of duty charged. Haven't tried the tires yet but I hope they are worth the money :)
4,I enjoy Pick'n on the Counting Crows in elevators,"I love Blue Grass and Counting Crows so I enjoyed this. Even though there are no words I can't help but sing along. It is a bit like elevator music, but still fun"
3,"""Toto Jr."" Has More Misses Than Hits (But Hits Are Catchy)","An early 80s Toto wannabe, Balance features fine LA-styled rock/pop musicianship, on-the-money singing/harmonizing, and tasty arrangements. Their short, well-crafted songs are succinct and hook-laden, but most of them miss being truly memorable. However, with songs like SLOW MOTION, HAUNTING, FLY THROUGH THE NIGHT, LOOKING FOR THE MAGIC and, best of all, the three minutes and thirty-seven seconds of driving pop confection called ON MY HONOR, Balance would do early Toto proud. (The bigger question: is there still a place for such middle-of-the-road professionalism in the recording business?)"
1,Second,"The color's right but the plate itself is either a second or a knock-off. This plate was in an order with multiple Fiestaware pieces, but there was something off about this particular piece(no Fiesta stamp and the shape was flatter and didn't stack right with other plates of the same size). Amazon replaced it quickly but with a plate with the exact same flaws. I would caution purchasing the ""Plum"" luncheon plate.Follow-up: I decided to purchase the ""Plum"" luncheon plate directly from Homer Laughlin. Imagine my surprise when I received ""a second"" - no stamp, with a slightly flattened profile. I now believe that the plates supplied by Amazon are most likely Fiesta products, so shame on Homer Laughlin."
1,Think these sold by Amazon may be knock offs not Fiestaware,Ordered plum luncheon plates to go with some other colors I already have. Shape was different (flat on edges underneath) and they won't stack with other fiesta plates. Thought that was weird. Then I noticed they do not have a mark/ stamp on the back that says Fiesta like all others pieces either. It is a darker color (plum) but my other darker colores all have a stamp. I am not sure who made these sent from amazon so they are going back.
4,An inexpensive and useful trail map for Yosemite,"This is a regular topographic map to Yosemite with the High Sierra Loop and other main trails marked up. On the reverse is a description of the High Sierra Loop, plus a dozen shorter trails all with brief descriptions and elevation profiles, and some natural history information.This is pretty minimalist, but then again for $2.50 it doesn't need to be more. Provided you can read a map this has all you need to spend several days on the trail, for the weight of a few grams."
3,Not at his best,In 1998 Sardou was not at his best when this live recording was made. He was recuperating from sickness and this was translated in the quality of his voice. Beside this Sardou is still a great performer with an outstanding group of musicians and backing vocals. Some of the best songs : Je Vole which is at it's best on the video and Salut which is a tribute to the public.
5,Another triumph of Neil Simon,"The movie is not as heart-warming and human as others of Simon's, but it is clever and witty, and the casting does it justice. Very enjoyable."
5,Cute movie,Enjoyed watching this movie. Saw it many years ago and loved both Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase. Still a clean wholesome movies.
4,Funny,"Good cast of characters liked the storyline. Chevy Chase was hilarious as usual, and I do love Goldie Hawn she is fun and cute at any age!"
3,Funny yet not devastatingly,Obviously this was an attempt to cash in on the pairing of Hawn and Chase that worked so marvelously in Foul Play.However the plot here leaves no bizarre situations as in Foul Play so that the two characters have to rather fight for situations apt to display their full comical talent. This movie entertains yet fails to make you laugh till you fall over.
5,Seems like old times,I purchased this product as a gift and I have been told they are very happy with this dvd.
5,Very funny movie..,"One of my favorite movies, I think Goldie is a very good actress in these kind of movies.She adds exacly what is needed to round out the funny parts...Not really a bad part in this movie.Great script.."
3,fun at the flicks,"This is a feel good flick, guaranteed to take your mind, at least for a little while, off the serious challenge of living life. It is sometimes silly, often funny and features two actors who can be very funny when given the opportunity. Tired of horror? Of murder and politicla intrigue? Of serious filial relationships? Try this."
5,This is easily my family's favorite movie!!,"If you appreciate the humor and ease of Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn, you will love this movie. Charles Grodin does a fantastic job of playing the upstanding yet jealous husband in this entertaining romance. This movie has lifted my spirits, as well as my mothers and sisters, since it's release in the 80's."
5,Seems Like Old Times,"This movie is a classic, and one of my all-time favorites. Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase are in top form at the height of their careers. Charles Grodin and Robert Guilliame are also terrific in their roles. I highly recommend Seems Like Old Times!"
4,A classic Hawn-Chase comedy flick...,"Goldie Hawn & Chevy Chase who previously were together in ""Foul Play"" reunite again in this classic Neil Simon movie ""Seems Like Old Times"". Chase gets mixed up in a robbery gone wrong and hes no longer wanted by his allegged accompliances and is dumped along side a highway while the car is in motion. Anyway Chase hides out and seeks the help of who else, his ex played by Goldie Hawn. But wait! Hawn is happily married to Charles Grodin who happens to pratice law cause Chase is wanted by the law. A lot of complications arise and Chase who is innocent needs Hawn's help very bad to clear his name."
3,What was I thinking,I remembered this movie to be much funnier. I thought it was a little stupid. Customer service was excellent. No problems getting the merchandise.
3,seems like old times,A great classic style Goldie/Chase romantic comdey...not as good as Foul Play but satisfying and endearing.
3,Highly Overrated,"I don't always go along with the Amazon review, but in this case it's dead on. With all the 5 star reviews on this listing I was expecting a little bit more. I love Chevy, Goldie and Charles Grodin as well, but this movie is a bit tepid the first good hour and only managed to arouse continued interest towards the last half hour.. I'd say rent it (wishing I had), and if that doesn't sate your appetite for the movie then buy it. Neil Simon has often been hit and miss for me.. the screen play in this one is, as the Amazon review puts it, ""forgettable"". It's better moments include slapstick farce, the storyline isn't that clever (not to mention beleivable) and it's stars are the main thing holding it up - they do a good job, but there's only so much you can do with a lackluster script. In a nutshell, it's more yawns than laughs. Not awful, but not great either. 3.5 stars.. 4 at most."
3,funny,"Funny movie with an entertaining plot. Although not as funny and entertaining as ""Foul Play"", it is still a good movie and among my favorite comedies. Also note that it does not have the extra dimension of suspense that ""Foul Play"" has."
5,Everyone should read,"A friend recommended this book as ""the best book he had ever read"". It was definitely worth the read. Very thought provoking. Now I've just got to find a yoga class."
5,Still frightening after all these years,"Sure, the Cold War may be over more or less, or perhaps the rival countries have changed, but this film is still frightening in its implications of doomsday scenarious, potential behaviors by people on both sides of the conflict, and different views of a world after a nuclear war.Look for a very young Larry Hagman as the president's translator of Russian. Nice job from the actor in his early days.Walter Matthau is far from comedic as the coldly philosophizing man who thinks killing 40 million to save the rest is a bargain of sorts.Henry Fonda also does a great job as the U.S. President.I also appreciated that fact that they were not willing to portray the Russians as evil and soulless machines bent on destruction; they were humanized instead.Great film!"
5,never trust a computer,Failsafe is one of the top 5 sci-fi superpowers war stories. A generals dream becomes his reality and no one is safe in failsafe. With today's technology this movie could actually happen
4,Very Good for the period,Very good at keeping your attention. Interesting to see so many great actors in one movie and still young. An excellent flix.
5,"A great, and very powerful","This movie is powerful, disturbing, frightening, and unforgettable. I had watched this movie today, and I was surprised by how great this movie really was. I would strongly recommend buying this !"
3,"Bad copy, Great movie !!","Remembered this movie from childhood, wanted to see it again uncut & crisp.looking .movie started out .grainy,very dark ( almost black screen ) audio was out of sync forfirst 25 minutes"
5,Awesome and scary.,Scary in the sense that I'm sure this is how our governments are handling this sort of thing and how vulnerable we all are. Wonderfully done though.
5,Better than original,Viewed Fail-Safe a few days after Dr. Strangelove and found the movie actually better than I remembered from before.
5,Better Than Dr. Strangelove?,"I used to believe that this film, by the extraordinary Sidney Lumet, was the ugly kid sister to Dr. Strangelove. But forty years later, it is this film that suddenly seems more fresh and pertinent, not because of the threat of nuclear holocaustic errors, but moreso because of the kind of leadership technologically oriented societies need. Henry Fonda's president, who is never even called by his name in the film, embodies the type of leader we no longer have. And that is what makes this movie more chilling and important than Kubrick's statement"
3,LIBERALISM IN HOLLYWOOD AND A TERRIBLE ENDING,"In 1965, a serious nuclear movie called ""Fail Safe"" was released. Henry Fonda is the President. A computer glitch launches The Bomb for the U.S.S.R. Fonda cannot recall it, and apologizes to the Soviet premier. His wife is visiting New York City, and in one of the worst political decisions in Hollywood history, Fonda tells the Soviets that in order to prove to them it was an accident, he will drop a 30-megaton nuclear bomb on the Big Apple! He carries through with his decision, despite his wife's presence there. The Soviets are portrayed as suffering their fate with dignified resolve.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM"
1,Ugh. Wish I'd stopped watching at the start. Waste of 2 hours.,Yikes. Rubbish. This movie was very disjointed. Didn't flow well together. Walther Matthau was poor (didn't seem to fit the role and his acting seemed to be rather wooden and uninspired). I'd DEFINITELY recommend you check out this DVD from your local library system before buying it. I'm glad I didn't shell out any money to see it.
2,Propaganda,"This film is interesting only in the fact that it is an odd relic of anti-Cold War propaganda; a pacifist film touting a suicidal philosophy of disarmament. Its particularly ironic that the smugness of the film's creators is now quite laughable in the hindsight of history. Despite all the dire predictions this film makes, thirty years later the U.S. would ultimately win the Cold War against the Soviet Union... and without a nuclear shot being fired in anger."
2,Not the FAIL-SAFE that you want,"Note that this edition of FAIL-SAFE (with the green radar screen cover) is issued by GOODTIMES and is recorded in LP mode.For any VHS collectors, the one to buy is theSONY PICTURESrelease which as of 10/09 was posted at under a buck, used. This tape, which has a photo of Henry Fonda on the slipcover, is a high-quality SP dub. (Click on ""Sony Pictures"" to access that page.)"
5,"A Great, Great movie","Fail-safe happens to be one of the few books I've read. A great book and a fine theatrical adaptation. I feel that Larry Hagman and Henry Fonda gave some of the best performances of their carrers. Very true to the book, in my opinion. I would watch it, commercials and all, each time it would come on broadcast TV and finally checked to see if it was on DVD. An exciting cold war thriller. I highly recommend this DVD."
3,"Good, but impact has lessened a little","The flip side of `Dr. Strangelove' - no nuclear satire here. Due to a technical error, a nuclear bomb is headed towards Moscow. This crisis unfolds with the military, the President (Henry Fonda) and a pro-war professor played by Walter Matthau. Very talky, but a good cast, including Fonda, Dan O'Herlihy, Fritz Weaver, Larry Hagman, and even Dom DeLuise. (!) The choices that must be made are terrifying, to be sure, but this film's impact has been lessened because there is no longer a Cold War. In 1964, or even in 1984, the impact would have been different for me. Also, because the Defense Department refused to provide aerial footage, stock footage was used, which looks incredibly cheap. If only I could have seen this during the Cold War..."
1,[is bad] Big Time,"This book is one huge waste of 15 dollars. Calvin has not even been to residential school and he writes as if he has been through the system himself. I think all information Cal has placed in this book is for the most part fictional. I recommend he don't quit his day job. Or catagorize his fictional depictions of his life where it belongs, in the fiction section of the library."
2,Watch those Springs they can poke your eye out!,"The metal plate holders are slippery around round plates and can be a very tight fit. So tight the metal hooks can slip off the plate and hit you in the face, so be careful. Once they are on they are ok."
3,Not Chisholm's best work,"This is the last book the excellent 20th century philosopher Roderick Chisholm wrote. It contains many of the final thoughts he had on metaphysical matters and for that reason is interesting. However, Chisholm was losing his sight by the time this book came about, and he wasn't able to edit it very well. Apparently he was a very visual writer and needed to see his thoughts written out to evaluate them and put them together coherently. This book jumps around a lot, even within chapters. Pieces of it are good on their own, but it doesn't fit together well, and substantive subject changes are frequent without any completion to the previous line of thought. It's probably worth reading for anyone who enjoys Chisholm's work. There's probably much benefit from such a pursuit. However, be aware of the deficiences of this book."
3,Beauty with high maintenance,"This ring is absolutely lovely and if worn just for special occasions or to match an outfit its ok. If, however you wear it for more than a few days the silver gets very shabby looking and the 'gem' gets hazy so you have to clean with a polishing cloth often. I believe the cost is too high for the quality of the product."
1,Eh....,"The resistance bands really should have some resistance to them to be effective. As for the grip thing and the jumprope, you have to try pretty hard to mess those up. The only really useful thing in here is the bag."
3,just ok,"It's nice to have, but I don't think you need all that stuff. And quality isn't all that great either."
1,Left too many questions.,This book gave very few details. It was like the author watched the trial on Court TV and wrote the book simply from that. There were very few things about what happened besides what came out in trial. I do not think the author did much research in writing this book and I am surprised that others have liked it. I would like to find another book on this case written by a different author.
4,Very good story!,"i REALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS AN ENGAGING BOOK. HOWEVER, CLOSER TO THE END IT STARTS ALL THE LEGAL JARGON AND YOU GET LOST. THE STORY IS ONLY FROM THE BEGINNING TO MIDDLE OF THE BOOK THEN IT STARTS THE TRIAL AND THUS THE BORE FROM MIDDLE TO END. WAY TO MUCH LEGAL JARGON FOR ME. I REALLY LIKED READING THE STORY AND WHAT THE BOOK IS REALLY ABOUT."
1,Flaky White Residue,"I'm a male with short hair and i style my hair by spiking it up. I used a generous amount of gel and at first it looks fine until it dries out. Maybe in an hour or so it looks like you have dandruff all over your hair because the gel has dried and turned flaky. I tried using less gel, but I still have the same results. Maybe it works for others, but it's unusable for me."
4,Pretty Good for Kinky-Curly Hair,"This gave a pretty good definition to my kinky-curly hair. It did not dry my hair out nor was it sticky. It will leave your hair soft to touch, and has great slip so a little goes a long way. It also gives extra shine."
3,Awful smell,"I gave it only 3 stars, even though the product is doing what it's supposed to. I have long corkscrew locks and it defines my locks in a most amazing way. My hair looks full and shiny and I would use this product again, but that smell is a real turn off. It smells like baby powder concentrate. It's overpowering everything else and unfortunately lasting several days, if I don't wash my hair in between. This smell is really nasty, imo. Not buying it again."
4,"Crap chemical free is good enough for me, mild flaking aside...","This product, as described, does not contain any of the BS chemicals that make their way into most regular cosmetics. I do experience some mild flaking with it, but it's not much to worry about (many of the regular gels do far worse in this regard). The lack of harmful ingredients is worth the trade-off. It leaves the hair in a natural looking state, with a faithful hold, but not one that's glued on, which is what I'm going for...natural manageability. Anyway, I like it :)"
3,B5 Design Gel,"I read in a magazine that Sarah Jessica Parker uses this gel. I used it and it made flakes in my hair and made me look like I had dandruff. It did however, tame my hair and hold it down."
3,"Nice and clean, cheap, moist","I got this to replace expensive dermalogica toners and expected it to work just as well. It kinda doesn't. Its fresh feeling and smells light and clean. But it doesn't keep my skin soft enough to clean blackheads away. I've noticed dermalogica toner after useage, keeps the skin soft enough to keep it clean while exfoliating and daily cleansing. Its good enough for after the shower or cleaning to keep you moist, but thats about it."
2,disappointed,"I found that when a label says ""sparkling"" that that is not always what the product it! There is no sparkle in this spray."
5,A little goes a long way!,"I hate using hairsprays and anything unnatural in my hair. Aubrey Organics is a company that I can trust to not put anything harmful in their products.If I need some extra hold or smoothing, I mix a small amount of this with some jojoba or coconut oil in the palm of my hand, and smooth it onto my damp hair. It does a fantastic job of holding without looking or feeling stiff. Don't use too much or it will flake."
2,Fine Hair Beware!!!,"I bought this product after reading these reviews and the reviews on the Aubrey website. A lot of people on both websites talk about the smell. I didn't think it smelled bad at all and definitely NOT like eggs! I applied the product to my wet hair and was excited to see that it looked really curly. (I have long, fine, wavy/loose curls) As my hair dried, however, it seemed to have a sticky coating on it that actually ended up weighing it down making it straighter. I think this product would be good for people with thick hair but was too heavy for my fine thin hair. I'm not giving up on the product because I LOVE Aubrey Organics, especially the primrose and lavender shampoo and their baby shampoo is awesome for the little ones. I will keep trying new combos with this product, maybe using just a tiny bit and mixing it with some very light leave in conditioner. Just wanted to let all you fine heads out there know that this may not be the best product for you!"
1,Awful product,"I bought this hair gel for my husband and sons, I used it on both my boys so far, and it looks ok at first, but later on when the gel has completely dried, it leaves white particles all over the hair. I had to brush off the dried bits of gel with a hair brush to get rid of the mess. It doesn't hold the style either. I don't recommend this product at all...it's a waste of money. Very disappointed."
3,Thin and ineffective for holding hair,"I bought this gel because of the natural ingredients and I had high hopes because of the word ""design"" in the name. I wanted something with a bit of hold. It really is more like a mousse for taming frizzies or setting curls. I have short, somewhat thick hair, and this product does virtually nothing to help me style it."
3,Not Thrilled,"I am a big fan of Aubrey Organics and use their Rose Honeysuckle Shampoo (which is awesome), however, this product didn't do it for me. It worked well taming my coarse, wavy hair, but I couldn't get over the smell. It leaves a very unpleasant scent in my hair. Have to return it unfortunately."
2,Smells like a wet dog,"I really wanted to like this, but it smells like a wet dog. I don't want to smell like perfume, but it's hard to get beyond this odor. I have a bit of wave to my hair and I suppose it helps. It does add softness - I can see how it would help soften really curly hair."
2,face tonic spray,"This product is ok. It has a nice, light musk smell and I have only used it several times, not used it up, so not sure yet whether I will ""see a difference"" from using the product. It is refreshing using it from the fridge, but I much prefer Better Botanicals line or Juice Beauty Harmonic Tonic... and the shipping was nearly as much as the product, which i was totally unaware of or I would not have made the purchase. I live next door to a Whole Foods and they sell it there."
2,Not the greatest,"Perhaps my hair type isn't the ideal type for this particular hair product - it left it a bit crunchy, and had an overwelming egg scent. The first day I used it, the entire morning I was having a craving for omelettes because of the smell - and after a few hours the egg scent got to be too much. I was stuck at work and wanted to just go home and wash it off.This is probably the only Aubrey's Organics product that I haven't thoroughly liked so far."
4,A True Cult Classic,"This is a great movie with a thought provoking skript and resonable acting the plot is this...A man pushes his mistress out of a lighthouseto her death,only to have her ethereal body parts come back to haunt him.I though this would be a terrable movie when I fist bought it but I was suprised its still veary much a B-Movie but being more of a phycological thriller its really good"
3,Tormented,"Saw bits and pieces of this film online and curious to see the rest. Humorous, dark, teen slasher flick. Actually pretty good...would recommend it."
2,"Disappointing, rambling, and lacking in suspense","I love Eric Ambler's work, which makes my reaction to this book surprising to me, particularly because I thoroughly enjoyed the introduction of Arthur Simpson. The supporting characters are unbelievably cast in the roles they play. Whether embarked on a revolutionary action or a complex theft, the characters seem incapable of gathering for either purpose and seem terribly sloppy for a group self-proclaiming themselves as careful and skilled. For example, throughout the book Simpson glances in his car mirror to see either an Opel or a Peuguet following the group; the bad guys never notice. Several times Simpson litters Turkey with cigarette packages filled with notes for Turkish authorities, which are picked up by the men in the trailing cars; the bad guys never notice and the Turkish folks always pick up the littered notes. Believeable? I don't think so. In the end the story lacks the excitement usually associated with Ambler's work."
3,Enjoyable read,"This is the first Eric Ambler book I have read and I found it to be an enjoyable read.This story is good but a tad hard to believe. I won't summarize the story as other reviewers havealready done a nice job of that. The book is very well written and suspensful. Some of theother reviews mention that the story has a humorous quality. I didn't find thisto be the case - yes, some of the dialog is told in a joking manner, as occurs in normalconversation. However, I wouldn't consider this to be a humorous story or one thatcontains humorous characters.It is not action-packed, it is more of a mystery than a thriller. Nevertheless I wouldcertainly read other books by the author."
4,Gritty Spy Drama,"If your a fan of John Thaw this is for you. Thaw gives another excellent performance in this ""cold war"" thriller as a retired spy who is pulled into a murder mystery with international ramifications. It is set in contemperary times but feels like a good old espionage story with a new twist or 2.There is even a fair bit of action sort of in the Secret Agent/Dangerman ""realistic"" spy mode. Well maybe a touch more realistic than that."
4,Leaf Spring DOES NOT have Bushings,"I ordered two leaf springs thinking that they are coming with bushings, as was said in the description, but they are not! I have to order set of bushings separately. They cost $42.10, item # Skyjacker SE39T Spr Bush Kit Rear 89-Up T. Also, the image showing two leaf springs, but this is not what you think. They are sold as a single piece, what was actually mentioned in the description, but someone may not notice it."
4,Leonardo da Vinci: the Universal Genius,"Written for the young adult, this well illustrated book is written in an engaging and easy to read story style biography. Noble often traveled extensively for research and the book is filled with black and white facsimiles of the master's works. A bibliography is included that can be used for further study along with a 'location of major works' although it may no longer be current. The book is indexed with people, places events and works, a great reference tool."
4,eric funk -- worth listening to and keeping track of,"Eric Funk's first disc is impressive. As a relatively young composer his music has both depth (without a sense of torpid academia) and simplicity (without condescension). The Czech Radio performance is a bit unpolished, but convincing.The Symphony No.1 is pleasant to listen to and intellectually engaging at times.'Lidice"" is a powerful programmatic work that chronicles the destruction of a Czech town by the Nazis. Its naive and rustic openning is propelling and gay. Its demise is effectively portrayed without being overly maudlin.Funk has an excellent sense for orchestral color and rhythmic ostinati that keep one's interest. I am excited to see the development of his style in future releases. I highly recommend this compelling recording."
5,Angel Ornament-1997,This ornament was safely sent to me; Very well wrapped. I am a collector and very pleased with this ornament.
3,"'Twas okay, I guess","When I was given this book by an ambitious Evangelical friend of mine, I eagerly dove right into it. Unfortunately, I was expecting something a little more original. McElveen doesn't come up with anything new, but rehashes things that have been refuted . . . nay, ANNIHILATED . . . numerous times before.When writing anti-Mormon fiction, one must always come up with new ideas. Don't forget that, people. Improve your arguments! Don't advance on us Latter-day Saints like a horde of mindless zombies. Show at least a glimmer of creativity!I do give this book three stars because I enjoyed following McElveen's extremely obvious polemical animosity toward the LDS faith throughout the book. His anecdotes of fictional bungling, stupid Mormons are also quite amusing."
2,A dime a dozen,"I have been through many, many ""anti-Mormon"" books since I started studying Mormonism. While this book gives a general synopsis of Mormonism, even I (an ""anti-Mormon"" protestant) could refute this book. While 20 years ago when this book was written, these arguments were solid, the crew at FARMS (huge Mormon apologist organization) has already refuted much (if not all) of the content in this book.I am sure he knows and has studied much concerning Mormonism, but the world of Mormonism has changed over the past 20 years. While many Mormons will give this a 1 star and condemn it to hell, and many evangelists will praise God for this book, I give it 2 stars. After reading through so many of these types of books, I have become quite selective about which book is good and which is not. For a solid read on Mormonism, pick up Letters to a Mormon Elder by James White or any Bill McKeever literature."
1,Stay away from this vendor,"Don't waste your money and time, misleading description, received merchandise but it does not match description, no labels, tags or logos of any kind, you are better off going to your local drug store and get same quality shorts 3/$10 at least I received a full refund........."
4,It definitely is working for me,"After being on the lowfat, low-carb, zone diets of the last decade I am forced to admit that my grandmother was right all along. Moderation in all things was her motto and she died a very active 82 year old.This book is deceptively simple. We have been deceived by the food police into thinking that eating should be complicated. Americans tend to have an ""all or nothing approach to eating"". But when you look at other cultures (the Europeans for instance)they eat what they want but in moderation.I began eating this way in November and I have gone from a size 14 to a 10. I don't feel deprived or obsess about what I would love to eat but can't have. I feel like I have been freed.Update - I bought my first pair of size 8 jeans in 12 years last week!"
3,It's Okay,"I read the book and thought that it was kind of silly at first, but none the less, I tried it. The author is absolutely right that portions in restraunts are enormous. For someone who doesn't want to count calories or fat grams, this is a simple portion control diet. I am also a Pilates instructor and thought this would deal more with the Pilates method than strictly eating and was disappointed by that."
1,"Not even a ""junk food lovers"" diet",It is very difficult to get adequate nutrients on less than 1200 calories per day. Especially when the eating plan is as pathetic as this is. Not enough fiber calcium or vitamin B as some example. Just another fad diet
5,delicious!,Made in Italy; this is the real thing. Delish. I bought several for friends as gifts. Fresh dated (good for several months).
1,"sounds good, but watch out!!","I bought this book, like other reviewers, curious about the amazing sounding cupcakes made famous by TV appearances and word of mouth.BUT- I've since made three recipes from this book that have been wildly dissapointing. The famous cupcakes, even though I followed the recipe exactly and consider myself an fairly experienced baker, were heavy and mouthy. I served them at a birthday and everyone was just suffering through them.I tried again with another cupcake recipe last night-- the result was okay when they were warm and then dried up, resulting in dry, grainy revolting cakes. I told a friend about this, and he said, well of course they don't want to really share the famous recipe for cupcakes. So sad, but so true with this book.I agree with the professional baker review that this book is dissapointing."
1,Disappointed,"Based on the reputation of this bakery, I purchased the book. I made 2 recipes from this book so far and have been very disappointed. Looks like this one will gather dust on the shelf."
1,Way to Burn...,"Alyssa Torrey offers terrible advice on how to toast nuts before adding them to a recipe: ""toast them in the oven at 350 for fifteen minutes..."" That's a sure way to burn your $7 per pound pecans! What gets me is that these exact same instructions are repeated in several of the recipes. Who edited this book????"
3,Dissappointed,"After purchasing the Complete Magnolia cookbook, I was rather pleased with the recipes, especially the cupcake recipe. I Saw a recommendation from Amazon to checkout More Recipies from Magnolia... and thought it was inaddition to the first book I had purchased. Very dissappointed to find that it has about 90% of the same recipes and 100% of the same pictures! Feel like I wasted my money and bought the same book twice, just a different cover!"
4,Yummy!,This is my 1st book from Allysa Torey and I am impressed by the simple way the book is presented and the simplicity of the recipie. This is the 1st baking book I have bought with more recipie then pictures of the cakes. Yet I am inspired to try out her recipies. I plan to buy her earlier book. Suggestion: To have more pictures in her next book to further inspire more people to bake!
3,A good Gazeteer,The Edgar Cayce Primer is really a gazeteer of the man's thought. It is more of a good reference work than an good introduction to his work.
1,shipper sucks,The book is good. The shipper sucks. It took a whole month to ship me my book. He never responded to my emails inquiring about my shipment. I will never by from them again.
5,The Edgar Cayce Primer,"Although I had to put the book down and think about what was written quite often, it was quite an intriguing book on Edgar Cayce's readings. I fully intend on purchasing more of his books for more insight."
2,Too small,Sorry Edgar. I have started to read this book several times. I give up. It's print is way to small and it's not interesting. I don't recommend this one.
3,Hard to read,"As much as I admired Edgar Cayce's life work, this book was hard to read. It just didn't keep my attention and found it very blah."
5,A wonderful journey of Self-Transformation,"Having only ever heard the name edgar cayce, and not knowing, what person it belonged to, I was intrigued to find out with this mystical name was all about.I was led on a journey I did not expect to take. It helped open my eyes to the interconnectedness of everything.One major thing I liked about this book, is it's not written in a way that sounds like hokey spiritual, better your life crud....IT's written in a way that is almost scientific. The constant relation to the concious, subconcious, and the superconcious, allow you to contstruct relationships in your mind about everything this book goes into.Well written, easy to read, and a great start at understanding the metaphysical...I highly recommend for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the metaphysical or spiritual realm, but has no idea where to start. This will give you the background KNOWLEDGE-not experiance-to continue discovering all there is out there."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book. For those interested in Edgar Cayce and for those interested in Universal MInd, God , Spirituality...etc..A Very good starting place...and a Easy read.. One of my favorite books as well..."
1,just a toy,We purchased this microspcope for our 9 year old so we weren't expecting it to be a professional tool. We are very disappointed by how it will only focus in the lowest setting. Controls are not tight. It is clearly meant to be just a toy and nothing else. A waste of money and the compnay is arguing over a return of the item.
1,BROKEN,"This item arrived in the box as described. We put it out on X-mas eve for our daughter to find from Santa in the morning. She found it and loved it - until we out the batteries in and it did not work. After inspecting the unit I found a small wire was broken from the contact. This would not be such a big problem (easy enough to re-solder) except that it could not be threaded back into the housing due to the item being assembled. What a let down for a child in the AM!Overall this is a cheaply made item. But something for a little more in terms of cost, or buy much cheaper (you will get about the same quality).The one saving grace is that Amazon & the seller took back the item and credited my account. I have since bought another one ($20 more) and am waiting for it to be delivered."
1,Waste of money,Cheaply made product. Smithsonian should be ashamed of yourself for licensing its name. I don't think it is possible to cut corners more.
5,MICROSCOPE,THE TURN AROUND TIME WAS GREAT ON THIS PURCHASE. IT IS A GIFT FOR MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND I KNOW SHE WILL ENJOY IT.
1,Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Can Cut Compulsive Hoarding.: An article from: Clinical Psychiatry News [HTML] (Digital),I am very dissatisfied with this purchase. It was not made clear that this article was only one page in length and that is was such a terse summary of the topic. For only slightly more I could have purchased an entire book on the subject. An article such as this for this price is outlandish and I will not buy from you again.
5,"Mythical, Magical! Share this story with your children.","Here is the art of story-telling in one of its best forms. Young and old will understand, enjoy, and will take the story's secrets to their hearts according to their age, experience, and spiritual refinement. I have thoroughly enjoyed this pleasurable reading. I have been giving copies of this book as gifts to young adults (above 10 years) in my family. This is the type of book we should use in teaching our children the real life lessons. Your children will thank you later in life."
2,Interesting with little or no technical content,My main problem with this book was that I couldn't find a thing about VB or ADO in here at ALL !
1,Design and Build Contract Practice,"Not recommended for the American marketplace. The book was written by a British author with experience in the British marketplace and practice of Design/build. It is not directly applicable to the States. Also, the technical terminology, grammar, and style of writing is British, making it very difficult to read for an American."
2,"nice series, but the presentation is a mess.","I loved this series, when I was still a kid living in Germany.It was much more popular than DROIDS here. I think because of the nice stories and ""bears"" are more popular than robots - at least for girls....But this isnt it - the old videoreleases where a ripoff too,only one episode on one video- but at least chronologically.They could have released a whole season, the whole series,or only one episode, but not for this price !If you dont have the videos, you can try it -but better buy the videos.This is only a VHS on DVD, it just isnt using the possibilities of the DVD."
1,It's LOW BUDGET cartoons,I was so disappointed!! I'd settle for the worst cartoons on Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network than waste any more precious time watching this garbage!!
2,"Ewoks cartoon on DVD, sort of...","Don't take my rating wrong, I don't hate this cartoon, what I hate is the way Lucasfilm has handled the property. Basically what this release is is 8 episodes from the first season of the show cobbled together to form two very unbalanced animated films. What we do get is basically 8 episodes of the show with new adult Wicket voice-overs. What we don't get is the opening theme song, original end credits, and I have a feeling original music (though I guess I'll never know since this will probably be the only release in this format.) At least the ""chapters"" are labeled with the original episode titles. I know this sounds nit-picky and in the vein of the ""complainers"" of the ill done reissues of the Original Star Wars trilogy on DVD, but come on. What is the purpose of releasing an old saturday morning cartoon, almost certainly because the fans demanded it for nostalgia purposes, and then heavily editing it so that it has almost no feel of how it originally aired?"
1,Not very nostalgic if you ask me...,You buy these types of shows for the nostalgia.. Not to see a new edited version of the show. I'm not happy with my purchase because they turned it into a miniseries instead of keeping it the show I remember. I highly recommend NOT getting this dvd if you're looking for a trip down memory lane.
3,It Never Ends,These episodes keep going and going! I never did finish it because it seems like there are hundreds of episodes. The shows are good to watch once but do not have lasting appeal.
4,it is what it is,"If you're a Star Wars fan with a sense of humor and lived through the 80s, this is fun to watch. If you're the uptight sort of fan, move along, this will just upset you."
4,3.75 stars interesting return to technoish Nato period!,This album of interpetations of 14 national Anthems floats somewhere between Kapital and Nato- early to mid 90's Laibach period. The album is very electronic with operatic singing- some classical and haunting string and piano- the montone deep voiced slavic -germanic vocals along with some softvoiced multitracked vocals. Its one of a kind for sure but maybe wears itself a little thin after a while- however its a welcome return after all the industrial metal the band has been producing the last few years. Its campy and serious at the same time and very european. The band collective or movement however you perceive it have produced what is a political statement with a soundtrack like feel. Laibach fans will be happy newcomers might have to get acquainted with their unique take on music art and politics. As a longtime fan i find this a solid effort for a band nearly twenty five years into its history.
2,Not so good,"Like another reviewer said, this book leave a lot of holes for the reader to figure out. The text is confusing, there are a number of mistakes in the numbers, and I find it easier to Google some of the topics rather than try to figure out what Rogerson is trying to say in the text."
2,Over the top,"Nah not my style... poor special effects and really under ...way under the average.The actors are pretty good and they all sing very well, they are talented ... just the script isn't good at all."
1,Disgusting.,"?Why A very sad, sad reflection of the how degraded American entertainment can be nowadays. At first, the idea is very 'Evil Dead' seeming. Then, it just dives right into the 'Hangover III' potty humor without wit. This show is weak, boring, repetitive, unevolved."
5,Cute story,"My granddaughter loves this book. Short, sweet story about a puppy and a little girl and how they become best friends."
1,Dont waste your time here,"I am really sorry to say that but If there was a rating as ""-1"", I would have given to this book. This is not an authentic book. Actually its from people who have nothing to do with Islam.Dont waste your money and time here. Spend it wisely. I started with ""Islam - Does it make sense"" by Ayub Hamid and found it very informative.I have found the translations by M. M. Pickthall and by Yusuf Ali better and from authentic source.Or search internet for ""Yusuf Estes"" for meaningful lectures about Islam and word of God i.e. Quran in pure american accent."
1,Naive attempt of evangelical youngsters,"Based on my visit to ProgressiveMuslims.org and some online research, this book is a product of a evangelical christian organization and chances are less that it would be a objective translation of the Quran. On their website, our friends at ProgressiveMuslims.org quote extensively from Quran, they just replace Allah with GOD (in capital letters) in all places. Pretty sweet, right.Interesting thing is there is a book review with five star rating by ""Layth S. Al-Shaiban"" and ""Layth S. Al-Shaiban"" is the website custodian of ProgressiveMuslim.org (the author). So certainly there is some self promotion going on here.In my personal opinion, those interested in reading a translation of the quran should look at other translations available on amazon.com that have some degree of authority."
5,awesome,"An absolute ""must have"" item for your Bloody Mary bar collection. No Packer, Badger, or Brewers game pre-game tailgate is complete without Bloody's, and your bloody isn't complete without this (if you like 'em spicy). A good flavored hot-sauce without being obnoxious."
5,Back stage mystery,"Robert Barnard never fails to please, and this wry tale of a podunk arts festival growing in strength, the dedicated yet-second rate actors and singers, and the fading theatrical stars (like the Barrymores, battling, boozing, and committing adultery) and rising fascistic international conductor (a bit like von Karajan?), is hilariously funny and incisively observed. The manager of the inn where part of the festival is held is the quintessential Australian know-it-all bore. Highly recommended."
3,Good supplement,"I used this in conjuction with the Transcender exams and passed with flying colors. The content here was fairly true to the exam content, and it helped fill in some gaps. This is definitely NOT the book you want if it's your only resource."
3,It's not that helpful,"As mentioned previously, the Transcender exam was MUCH more helpful than this book. Unlike the VB exam cram books, this won't help you answer too many questions on the exam.If you want a very intro book to databases, it is ok. If you want something to pass the Microsoft Architectures exam, this book won't help very much."
3,Not bad!,"I used this book as my #3 source; my primary source was the Transcender demo test (Transcender.com) and my secondary source was an IT developer who passed the test. I barely passed the test on my first attempt, and I think without this book I would have fallen just short. In our group, this book was considered to be the best for 70-100 - which isn't saying TOO much."
2,Don't waste your money on this book,"I am a programmer with 10 years experience in a non-MS environment. I started the MCSD recently and bought this book, because of the favourable reviews on this site. I passed this subject with a high score, but not becuase of this book. This book left me confused and with more questions than answers. I then got hold of the New Riders book and it much better, it is easy and nice to read and explained the subject very well. My advice is don't waste your money on this book. Not even the New Riders book prepares you well for the exam, but at least it will give you a very good understanding of this subject."
2,"Good High-Level Review, but Supplementation Required","This book is not designed for beginners. Unless you have lots of experience designing and architecting solution architectures, you will definitely need additional supplementation materials to pass the 70-100 exam! This book just skims the surface of the knowledge needed to pass the exam, so if you do not have the knowledge base needed you should supplement this study guide with a more detailed book. Also, the book does a poor job actually preparing you for the type of questions on the test; it would be very beneficial to supplement it with practice tests from companies such as Transcender.Overall, the book is not enough to pass the 70-100 test!"
1,Useless,"The book was just a bunch of chit-chat. The exam involves diagramming, modeling, etc; none of which was covered in the book. Many details of other topics were overlooked. Try Transcender."
5,A great book but you need two more aids,"This book is great! The exam is real tricky - its the only one I have ever failed on first try - miserably! No book can prepare you for the Architectures exam fully but this book gets very close. I guess if you have a few years experience in data modelling you can pass with just this book. but if like me you have very little experience in data base design and data modelling, you definitely need something else. I bought and read the Data Modelling book by Lawrence Sanders after I failed this exam. That is a little book that fills in all the gaps! After reading these two book, anyone can pass this exam. Oh, one other thing you most likely will need is the Transcender sample tests. This exam is unlike the othe Microsoft exams and without the Transcenders it will be a shock the first time you do it and that may cause you to fail. So invest in the Transcender sample tests for this exam and you will be glad you did. Good luck!"
2,No book will help you with this exam ... period!,"Having read the book and taken (and passed) the exam, I can honestly say that NO BOOK will help you with this exam. Like the reviewer below me says, the exam is all case studies - multiple choice questions are only a small part of it. You need to be a combination busines analyst / technical architect / DBA to pass this exam. I give this book two stars only because it's the best one out there, but it really won't help you at all. If you're serious about passing, get the Transcender Exam (or the free Transcender Demo) - it's identical in structure to the real exam and the questions are amazingly similar. I'm someone who felt obligated to buy some book (any book) to help me pass - it didn't help at all."
2,Not really applicable,"I was quite disappointed in the book. Although much of the information in the book could be generally useful, there is really very little that is direcly applicable to the exam.As an example, chapter 3 describes the various development models under the Microsoft Solution Framework, but there are no questions on this in the exam!Bottom line, don't rely on this book to help you pass 70-100."
2,Average at best,"I saw all the 5 star reviews and expected a lot from this film but I was left disappointed. It was disappointing because there was really nothing new for me. I've heard of the ideas of connectivity and the science backing it up so this film was rather dull. The film talks little about whats wrong with the world and how to change it and instead talks a lot about life's purpose or the way we should be living life. There were also very few scientific examples and its mostly just what a few famous people said and that must be the correct way of thinking or behaving. And thats what really ruined it for me. The only parts I liked was when the film maker was talking about his life experiences, what he went through and why he changed. Overall, I would not recommend this documentary because it was rather unexciting, uninspiring and very few facts."
2,Don't expect inspiration.,"I love reading and watching movies on spirituality. They usually teach me and leave me inspired. Hovever, I feel like this movie was incredibly depressing and took a backwards appoach at explaining the point. Perhaps it's a good movie as an introduction into expansion for someone who is not familiar at all with spiritual principals. I understand what he was trying to convey. I just thought the negativity was touched upon too much. I would much rather receive the same information in a much more positive manner. I personally enjoy Abraham-Hicks, Wayne Dyer, the Secret, Eckhart Tolle, etc."
5,Every American should watch this film...,"It has been a while since I was this impressed with a documentary. This man's story about his transformative experience inspirational to say the least, and the information he has surfaced and made available to us in this film afforded veracity to the nature of his experience. An amazing film proving yet further that we all really are irrevocably connected, and that the materialistic emphasis of the Western world simply has no logical segue into the happiness we all seek. Every American should watch this movie. Two thumbs up!"
5,Inspired to Change,Beautiful movie. Profound. Gently moved me back to the realization all things are connected. Peace is possible within each of us.
5,GREAT!!!!!! GREAT!!!,GREAT!!!!!! GREAT!!!!!!!This is such a beautiful CD. Everyon should have a copy!!! I got a couple more copies for family; and they loved it too!!!
5,Should you watch this?,"Absolutely. Everyone should watch this movie. Everyone.This is a movie for those who think they are of more value... and contribute more... than others.This is for those who think it doesn't matter if they contribute or not.This is for those who live in our world and put everything they have into living fully.This is for those who feel alone.This is for those in despair.This is for everyone who rejoices life and everything in it.And for those who just don't give a damn.Do you think that what you do, does not matter? That your small thoughts and actions have little effect on the world?Do you think you do not affect the world around you?Do You think You can change the World?!?This movie is for everyone.Watch it."
5,has changed my way of thinking forever,"I came across this on own today, and I must say I am changed forever. I have never been so touched by a film. It makes you think about everything in life how you handle situations etc to teach yourself to pay attention to a chance to make a difference. My pets come to mind in this how they are so unconditional want nothing from you JUST LOVE and they are always happy. I so look forward to owning this. I only wish it could be an audio cd so I could listen anytime to remind me how fragile life is. What a great way to start 1/1/12. Well done Tom you are my hero."
3,Interesting but pretty superficial,"It was an interesting documentary-style film that makes an effective attempt to connect the physical (i.e. neurology) and the spiritual aspects of humanity and how we can live more fulfilling lives. That said, I found it pretty superficial but it had some thought-provoking moments."
2,Amazon item,This DVD was good but not Australian so I couldn't play it on my DVD player or on a laptop without changing countries which can only be done 3 times
5,I Am,An honest look at what IS wrong with the world and offers inspirational thoughts on what we can do about it. Provides great insight for those truly seeking to create a better future for everyone they care about and all living things on this planet.
5,The ME people,All of you with your needle stuck on ME should gain a new understanding of what really matters to truly be Human
3,"So, So","I honestly can't remember all the details because it's been a while since I watched it, plus I also, I watched all three DVDs in a row the same night so therefore, I can't remember which one said what. However, I do recall enjoying all of them. The Living Matrix was my favorite. I liked ""I AM"" by Tom Shadyac the least, and I would definitely recommend Finding Joe."
2,"Good message, but wishful thinking","In science class we learned about something called junk science.In debate i learned how to take things out of context and about contradictions.Contradictions, out of context facts and junk science are the support for this documentary. Not a bad messageAlso fails to take into account anthropological factors and evidence."
3,not as deep as I thought,"This movie began with a powerful quote. However not long after it lost it's potency (for me).I am not knocking it, just saying that somethings are for some. I know a few people who saw it anddeemed it a great movie. It was ok for me."
5,Very inspiring film,"I really enjoyed this film. It was a great discussion of our unseen connection to each other and to the natural world. It also touches upon the science and experience of sympathy and compassion for each other, how it is natural for us, and that our current world that does NOT exemplify such values, does NOT represent the way things need to be.It also touches upon some more esoteric science, such as when the host apparently was ""psychically"" influencing the electrical activity in yogurt. Take that with a grain of salt, but it would truly exciting if such phenomena could be substantiated.Overall, I found it a very enjoyable documentary, and I was happy to share it with friends."
5,Awesome,"Tom Shadyac is fantastic- If this were required viewing the world would be a better place- Three cheers for ""I Am"""
5,Amazing film,What a journey the filmmaker is on and he shares it in such a compelling and inspirational fashion. Highly recommend this film.
5,I AM,I not only love the message but it is also really well made with beautiful visuals. Would recommend everyone watch it
1,"Fatuous, Self-Absorbed, and Anti-Scientific","This is just more religious nonsense that asks the viewer to dismiss rationalism, science, and reality. Equating the theory of evolution with ""Social Darwinism"" is reprehensible and offensive.Then there is the film's promotion of ""HeartMath."" one of the most ridiculous forms of pseudoscience ever. None of its claims have been validated with reliable research. HeartMath actually runs counter to modern physiology. ""I Am"" argues that because of this ""scientifically proven"" physical heart-to-heart connection between humans, it is in our ""self-interest"" to feed the starving. Maybe the starving should be helped just because suffering is abhorrent.That Shadyac didn't question that the wired-up yogurt is sensitive to his thoughts/emotions (""heart intelligence""?) is incredible. How would you like to try that in controlled conditions, Mr. Shadyac?"
1,Progressivism at its finest.,"Progressivism at its finest.This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Without NATURAL AFFECTION(Wow), trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.Im not saying ALL of these descriptions apply to the Progressive movement (after all the""Secret Combinations"" that will destroy our freedom are divers) but no one can deny the obvious accuracy of these descriptions.Let The Beating Begin."
5,My newest favorite movie,LOVE IT. Everyone should watch and open your eyes to what is around us all. You too can make the world a better place..
5,Loved it - has anyone come across this DVD with subtitles?,"My family and I watched this movie last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, due to my hearing impairment, I missed the majority of the dialogue. I was able to follow along with the basic premise, and the spectacular photography kept me riveted. Unfortunately, my Netflix version did not have subtitles, so I was wondering if anyone has seen a version that does. I would buy it in an instant if I knew it had subtitles, since we all want to see it again and I'd like to share it with everyone I know. Incidentally, as I went through my day today I was conscious of being kinder to people and trying to do nice things whenever I could, and wondering if my small deeds were changing the world. Shadyac's message definitely had an impact on me!"
5,Thought provoking,"A great movie to watch with family and friends...some rich discussions come out during and after the film was over (yes, we hit pause during several parts of this movie)."
4,Great Movie!,"I enjoyed this DVD very much! It is simple yet profound, right to the point. Caring for the world, knowing that we are all one and we all want the same, happiness, love, success, feel connected.This DVD is not for those who looks for scientific facts and intellectual stimulation but rather for those who know that love is the answer."
5,I wish I could require people to watch and understand this,What a wonderful perspective this man is offering to us all. It's this sort of thing that makes me feel like we might just have a chance to move forward and evolve into what we were meant to be as humans.
3,OK,"It was ok, but a little disappointing as I had been lead to believe that it was primarily about shedding possessions, and that did not turn out to be the theme of the movie. So...it was an OK movie....but with different than expected theme."
4,Worthy film,This is a better than average documentary- exploring our materialistic culture and its effects on our lives; well- done by Tom Shadyac.
3,"Imperative and vital topic, the flow and content so, so","he topic is probably one of the most important one ever , greed and human excess is dooming the planet.. That said, the movie was slow and the interviews were just lukewarm....I mean some of the most fabulous people on the planet to interview, and their comments and insights were, i am not sure, just not very deep?Worth watching for a few sentences and especially for the truly unaware. If you are already deep into the ""quest"" to save the planet and it's inhabitants, it's a little light."
3,"It was good, but not great","they could have looked further.... It felt like something was missing however it was worth the watch... But in this day and age most people are waking up, while other still sleep walk through life... This video may not be the wake up call, but its a good watch."
3,Not the best.,"I didn't really like this book but it was O.K. It was about a girl who's father died during World War two so she, her mother, and little brother have to move to Parish Grove with her strict Aunt Bess so her mother could find a job. Mandy is scared of the sheep but she has to take care of them. She meets this Boy named Dean when she sees him steal some money from the store her mother works in. She goes to school and meet a girl named June they ecome friends. She has all kinds of adventures including having a box social. Her mother sys some things about her father and she gets really angry and relizes thay are going to Buy the store in Parish Grove instead of the fulton Place. Then she finds the sheep are stranded on an island and can not get off because the water is rising. She tries to go and save them."
2,"Great Idea, Impactical to Use","Like many women out there, I am in dire need of a little boost in the cleavage department. I have to admit, I purchased this item because of how cute it's packaging came and the promises it wielded. The truth is, this item is HEAVY and it does NOT fit most bras. It pokes out of bras either the underside or it comes up over the bra. Because of this, this item doesn't really stay put, which calls for a lot of embarassing trips to the bathroom to readjust."
2,Too Expensive Compared to Other Products,"I'm not really a kid. I just don't want my ID showing up here.Yes, I've purchased these, and these inserts are ok, but they are too expensive. You can get virtually the same product in a flesh color for about one third the price of this product. The SAME product. Only thing different is the box they are delivered in and the color. Why pay more for a pink box?The alternative is the Original Looks insert, which can be found at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00076Y684/ref=ox_ya_oh_product"
4,Works but sticky,They work really well but tend to stick too much and don't breathe after a night of dancing.
2,a LITTLE lift,"If you want just a little lift, buy these. If you need a bigger lift (like me...I am a small B) purchase the Original Looks Silicone Breast Enhancer Bra Inserts. I was disappointed in these - they are clear so although they are politically correct boobs in a box, they will match no-one's skin tone in the unfortunate event that they slip up and become visible. My biggest complaint was the size though - I just needed something that would fill me out, and this only caused gap-age in my B cup.I also (unfortunately) purchased the ""cupcakes"" and they seem to do the exact same thing as these, so don't bother with both; they don't appear to change the look of the cup-size or shape any differently (at least not for smaller cup sizes)."
2,take outs,"they didn't quite live up to the hype, but they ""help"" a bit. However, they are very uncomfortable in warm weather and they don't quite allow for the various placements illustrated. Cinching up the bra as advised does not work!"
2,Return them,The item looks good in the picture but when you put them on they do nothing. Didn't give me cleavage or anything so I returned it.
1,Get the Victorias Secret Miraculous Bra instead!,These little cutlets are garbage. Not only are they hot but they slip around too. I used to be a C before nursing and now I am a sad B. I bought the Victoria's Secret Miraculous bra and I look like I am back to a C! Yay! I love that bra! And...they have Miraculous swimsuit too to continue the deception of a larger chest. The bra is way more comfortable and cool. Buy that instead.
1,So vulgar,"I am sorry to say but that movie is trash from beginning to end. The language is so vulgar you wouldn't believe, no class, boring scenario, and on top of that average acting. Don't waste your time and money on this."
4,"Been There, Done That...And Am SO Glad!","In 1973 I, as a re-entry woman, went to the community college portrayed in this book. I took a class with Dorothy Bryant, and thus, I read this book. It was almost me in those days, so of course I could relate to so much of it. I sat in the same rooms, watched the same students, walked the same campus. It is now decades later, and I am still thankful for that experience, this book, and especially for the talents, wisdom and kindness of its' author, Dorothy Bryant. I am so glad to see it still in print. READ IT!"
5,"Superb, concise, useful. An excellent read","At the time of reading, I was a novice R/C pilot. This book became a reference for me and I read the sections particular to the area I was learning - several times over until it stuck. Sound advice in this book. Take it with to the field and read again before you preflight. It'll pay dividends !The book touches on a wide spectrum of aspects of the hobby. Each section is short enough to read several times over in one go, yet detailed enough to even serve those who have to go it alone. A thoroughly enjoyable book."
1,Poor Job Explaining Concepts of Flight,"Not sure who would order this book. It seems too advanced for beginners, but not advanced enough to provide anything new to experienced flyers. The use of diagrams was an interesting feature though none a explained clearly enough to be of much releveance. It was a ok first attempt, but I think the author needs more poslish in presenting technical topics such as this."
1,Does not completely stop paint from going through,"You should note that the paint will go through the canvas onto your rug/floor when you step on the paint that's on the canvas. This has happened to me both times I used them for painting. The paint on the canvas was normal drops of paint you get when painting, not spills."
1,Horrible product that does NOT work,"Painting new house and purchased two of these to protect my carpets. Paint falls on the drop cloth and quickly goes right through it and onto your floor. My painter had a slight accident and I am going nuts trying to get ""Colonial Rose"" paint off my gold carpet. Don't waste your money. Buy heavy duty plastic!"
2,Beware of Big Drips or Spills,"Just like a review that I read before purchasing this product; one needs to be vigilant of big drips or spills. Paint will leak through the canvas and you might end up with a mess on your carpet or floor. Luckily, we were using latex paint and were able to clean the green paint out of the carpet before any permanent damage was done. I wish that the canvas was not as porous (had a much tighter weave). We are now using a small sheet of plastic under the roller pan or paint can but over the drop cloth to avoid future problems. We are also paying better attention when we are painting. We will keep using this drop cloth as well as the other 4 ft X 12 ft from the same manufacturer, but I wouldn't buy them again."
5,Very nice,Thick and very nice. I was not sure what I was going to get for the money but I was very happy with this. Now if I can just get a decent painter.
3,Horrible smell!,The tarp works well and i dont have any problems with it functionally. However it had a horrible chemical/musty smell. I couldn't figure out why the room i had storred it in (still in the wrapper) smelled so bad. The problem became evident when i unwrapped it and the smell increased. It seems to have aired out over time but i'm not sure i'd buy another one of these for this reason.
2,Interesting but not exactly riveting,"If you were around in 1964, this book provides a lot of nostalgic references. If you were actually in high school then, I imagine the book would be a treasure to you. If you were not around during this period it gives you a good idea of what it was like in 1964. Because the book is literally divided into 365 days (chapters), it seemed very disjointed compared to a ""normal"" novel. Though it reads quickly, mainly because the seventeen year old's perspectives don't contain much deep, thought provoking material, it was still too long. I read about 10 months worth, then found myself skimming to the end to just get it over with, so I could start a book that might be more exhilarating."
2,The Book Of Reality for the uneducated,"I personaly Did not like this book. Being a 17 year old boy I didn't like the fowl Language in this book, or the abount of sexual situations within it. It however is true to the lives of those living in the era, and does give some insight into the lives of children in the 60's."
2,The Bull Starts Here,"""Today, Bob Greene is a celebrated, nationally-syndicated columnist. In 1964, he was a seventeen-year-old Ohio high school kid. And he kept a diary.""It's all here. The teenage girl who got away...""Snicker, snort."
5,GREAT!,"Be True To Your School was given to my father for Christmas by my uncle, Allen Schulman. (who is one of Bob Greene's friends in this book) I read it before my father did because I had nothing to read on the plane home to Texas from Ohio. Anyway, even though I wasn't born until much later than 1964 I enjoyed this book very much. I loved the references to tv shows and music. Even the title refers to a Beach Boys song. It is a very wonderful read, even if you weren't in highschool in 1964."
5,A Modern Day Tom Sawyer,"Just like Twain wants the reader to remember their childhood as they read Tom Sawyer, Bob Greene wants readers to remember all of the craziness high school had to offer. Even though I graduated in 1987, Greene's account of 1964 brought back memories of stints I used to pull in school. The long term friendships, the first loves, the ""first time"" are all remembered in this excellent autobiography. I recommend this book to anyone who ever went to high school. Green makes everyone want to return to High School USA."
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read.,"I grew up in the sixties, and was only 5 years old when this diary was written. However, my memory goes back to when I was one year old in some situations, so I do remember things that Bob talked about in his book--the music, the styles, and the TV programs, to name a few. This brought back memories of some of the best years of my life."
2,Not good.,"I bought this after reading When We Get to Surf City. It was mentioned that they called him for that book, after reading this one. But it wasn't as good. Just a boring teenage boy's journal. Every once and a while there were some pop culture event he witnessed but wasn't impressed."
4,Be True To Your School,"In the book Be True To Your School Bob Green expresses his life as a teenager in the year 1964. I enjoyed reading this book. Being a teenager, I can really relate to it and even at any age you can. He deals with alcohol, girls, and most important school. ""You can relate to the pressure that other people put on Bob thoug out the book."" For example in the book the upperclassmen are drinking so Bob things that is a good idea because they are.While in the year 1964 Bob has to deal with friends, his job, and rlationships with others. ""He explains the troubles of high school, concerning relationsips, friends, and his first job."" This book makes teenagrs, those who have been a teenager, and those who havent became a teenager see what a teenager does and think. I would recomment this book to anybody."
3,Not a lot of detail.,"This book is a ""light"" read.It covers a lot of histroical areas,but not in much detail.The author uses the name ""Yahweh"".He gives some details on the books of the Old Testament mostly.He writes about the ""source theory"" and some of the differences in beliefs such as when the name Yahweh was first known in OT times.There are some interesting theories:Zilpah and Bilhah were of ""mixed race"".The tribe of Levi never went to Egypt at all.The idea that boiling a kid in it's mother's milk was a Canaanite,magic fertility rite.The possible split authorship of Isaiah,1-39 and 40-66.He mentions a few times in passing the lost ten tribes of Israel and the history of Samaria as a capitol for King Omri.This is a book suited to someone wanting a starter type book on Biblical history.I would recommend ""Restoring the Original Bible"" by Ernest L. Martin to anyone wanting a more detailed study of Biblical history."
5,Amazing Divine Life,"A wonderful book, learn the Unknown and walk alongside the life of the Nazareth... The part of His life that wasn't written in any of the books we know... Amazing Divine life... The book is a great piece of Art, a joy to read and to own... Highly recommended."
5,Bittersweet,Can't recommend this movie enough. It really creates a sense of longing. Wonderful acting. Well composed shots. The music was spot on. Great little film!
5,marc jordan at his best,i never thought i would get to hear this music again the whole album flows from beginning to end with such power. so glad someone took care of this copy so i can relive the feelings this album conjures up . amazon is such a great resource . they make it extremely easy to trust and purchase.
1,PLANTPOTS ANYONE?,"I won't waste time or words reviewing this album. I bought it in LA in 1988 and compared to his earlier work-Mannequin, Blue Desert and the Live album on Rio Records there is simply no comparison. AVOID"
1,Another of Prima's hack-'n'-slash jobs...,"...hits the streets with a resounding ""thud."" It's amazing to me how Prima can keep pumping out this garbage. I guess the only thing more amazing than the low quality of Prima's ""strategy guides"" is the fact that we keep buying their cruddy books."
1,"Fascinating topic, disastrously bad production","This third rate production of a fascinating story is simply terrible. Every time, and it happens every few minutes, that there is a speaker talking in another language, the English voiceover is produced at the same volume as the original speech! This means that the viewer can't make out what is being said in either language. Together with splicing material from other DVDs in a short series of four--means you do not get a good value for your investment.My advice is to wait until somebody better comes along--this is unwatchable."
3,Too Many Dark Pictorial Examples in Documentary,"I believe that this would have been a better documentary for Christians to be informed about, but there were too many pictoral examples of people doing immoral and occultic practices for me to stomach viewing past 10 minutes. I don't think there needed to be so many visuals like this to make the point. Just too vexing to watch."
3,Not the best in the series,"I agree with a couple of the other reviewers about the slow character interaction in this installment. The misunderstandings and miscommunication between Steven Thomas and the rest of his family and team got downright boring by halfway through the book. It reminded me of the dragged out relationship between Jondalar and Ayla in Jean Auel's Valley of Horses. It did seem like she was either being paid by the word, or stretching a trilogy out to four books. The overarching story is wonderful, but I had to force myself to keep reading until I got back to the storyline at times."
2,Ultimately Forgetable,"I bought this book because of the cover blurb by Ursala K Le Guin. I read it last week. I have almost forgottten the premise, if any. I have read no other volumes in the series: I do not plan to waste my time. Characters, whether human or extra-terrestrial are unrealized. One sentence paragraphs, even when not dialogue. Don't bother."
1,Will not foam!,This is just a big bug sprayer! It will not foam! If you want a big bug sprayer buy this.
4,"happy now, but not at first",Bought two of these.Spent several minutes when I first received them with one hanger rod in vise bending it so the feeder would hang straight.Ant moat leaked on both. When factory drilling was done to mount hanger a leak resulted. One mounting was so off angle that feeder hung tilted.Sealed bottom of both moats today.Moats now fixed.I'm happy now.
2,Snubbed by Hummers,"I read so many reviews and opted for this one, rated highly among other Amazonians. However, my little hummers did not share these opinions, and have snubbed this new feeder in favor of their older feeder. Having three voracious hummers dueling over this lone feeder, I had hoped this new one, with it's many stations, would make everyone happy. But alas, the squawking of these tiny birds was enough to make me drive (in the car!!!) to the hardware store in search of a viable replacement. After summing up the many designs displayed on the shelves, I finally picked one, hoping my feathered friends would like it enough to feed upon it. Lo and behold, after moving it around the yard a bit, I seemed to have struck the perfect combination of the old feeder, and the newer one. Finally, everyone is happy and there is much less squawking, but now I have this extra feeder....."
1,Not-so-cheap knock-off,"This feeder is a cheaply made (but not cheap!) knock-off of the Aspects Hummzinger, a much more durable feeder without the yellow parts that can attract attract bees. After problems with Perky Pet feeders, I now use only all-red feeders and find that it doesn't take new birds more than a few seconds to learn where the holes are (hummingbirds are a lot smarter than you think). For the same money or less you can get a feeder that's more durable, even easier to clean, less likely to attract bees, and made by a company that doesn't crank out cheap knock-offs or exploit you and the birds by marketing chemical-laced ""instant nectar."""
3,"Ok for the price, but kinda flimsy","For the price, this is a good hummingbird feeder, but it is much flimsier than the more expensive ones that I've bought in the past. I bought 2, and one of them hangs crookedly and consequently can't be filled all the way up."
5,HUMMINGBIRDS LOVE THIS FEEDER,"My first hummingbird feeder I bought was an upside down glass feeder with a metal base that ended up leaking, rusting, and the bees would swarm it until all the liquid was gone. The second one I bought was an all glass upright Parasol feeder. It was very difficult to clean and not worth the time. I decided to try this feeder and I love it. I have 2 more Hummingbirds now than before. It is so easy to clean which is wonderful since the Hummingbirds go through it within 5 days. I wish I would have bought this feeder the first time around. I plan on getting a few more as gifts for Mother's Day."
2,hummingbird feeder,"My hummingbirds have not returned to my yard since I put up this new feeder. I had birds with another feeder that gave out, but they have now gone to the flowers in my neighbor's yard instead. Maybe their beaks are not long enough to reach the liquid."
2,Lopsided!!,"I just bought this feeder yesterday. I washed it, put some sugar water in it and hung it up outside. I noticed right away that all of the liquid went to one side making the feeder tilt. I tried to straighten it but it just falls back to one side. I'll keep it and mount it on a pole like one reviewer mentioned."
5,Do you love Hummingbirds,"I bought 3 of these feeders and after the first week have to check them frequently since the local hummingbirds flock to them and feed. They are easy to clean and fill with new solution plus come with a feature to deter ants. Great price, product and I would recommend it to anyone who loves hummingbirds."
3,NOT sung the way you're used to,"The redentions of some tracks on the ""Children's Songs"" CD are jazzed up versions . . . more complicated, untraditional rhythms and notes. If you're buying this for a child who already knows these songs by heart, then you may like this. However, if you're looking for recordings so you can teach your child the original versions you're used to, you may want to look elsewhere."
5,Great Collection of Childrens' Songs,"I purchased these CDs when my daughter was just a baby. It is a great collection of children's songs. I looked at a number of other children's CDs and found this one to be the best. The other CDs I looked at would have the same songs but were sung in a very ""cheesy"" or ""folksy"" way.My daughter would get really antsy in the car as a baby but the music would miraculously calm her immediately. The lullabies would soothe her to sleep in the car as well. My daughter is now 2-1/2 years old and now loves to dance to these songs and sing the nursery rhymes. I also found the collection to be a great value. I would definitely recommend it to any parent with young children."
3,"Interesting, if you are a fan","I met ""The Hulk"" too, several years ago. That was a dream come true. Unfortunately, I met Lou during a tough competition -- his return to the Olympia for the Masters category. And I think this book is consistent with how he deals with loss and/or difficult challenges: he spends a lot of time complaining about life, IMO. Although some people would find it inspirational, I could not relate to the book at all. This book is interesting if you are a Lou Ferrigno fan."
4,"A cautiously hopeful, real-world answer to The Wire","This documentary series is sadly brief but gripping, moving. inspiring, and highly entertaining. One misses the added nuance and depth that could come from more episodes, but at least it doesn't presume to answer all the questions it raises.Required viewing for anyone passionately concerned about the American urban environment at the start of the 21st century, and recommended especially to viewers of The Wire for a view of a real Northeastern inner city, its challenges and complexity, and one that shows some things really can get better."
3,Boring,"This book describes the origins and evolutions of the National Laboratories in the USA. These include Argonne, Los Alamos, Sandia, etc... The book begins by describing their origins during World War II as research labs for testing and designing various components for a nuclear weapon: delivery, fission, detonation, etc... The book shows how different scientists, businessmen, academics, and politicians played their parts in creating National Labs system. The book continues by showing how each lab grew to become specialized in specific fields, the rivalries between different labs and their directors, and how the labs interacted with other parts of the US bureacracy such as the different branches of the US military. In all the book is well referenced and easy to read, but this reviewer found the subject matter quite boring."
5,Just a delight!,"Another enjoyable book by Mr. Titchmarsh. Here his extensive knowledge of gardening is used as he interweaves it into an enjoyable story.I loved the characters, and also like that he mets out justice without being ugly and interfusing violence.I enjoy his humor and his characters.I am so glad I stubbled over him as an author."
2,Re-Hash,If you are buying one more book to fill your Luger library and have no other titles to get then this one will fill that slot. As far as in depth information and something you haven't learned several times before then book doesn't have it. While the name Encyclopedia tells you what it is don't expect to find any new data by John Walker even if it was written in 1985 he just rehashed prior work.
3,Its alright,"If you need this book, and are aware of it, the subject content won't surprise you. I found it a tedious read with too many examples... which are aplenty online."
5,Great Book,"I purchased this book when it first came out years ago. I repurchased it when it was rereleased. It not only addresses the relationship between a man and his romantic partner, but can also be used to understand the relationship between a man and his daughter."
4,12th SS Vol I & II,"This is an excellent historical reference book. It provides another viewpoint to the Allied histories of the war. There seems to be an obvious bias which is also present in many if not most of the Allied histories. Viewed in the context of contrary histories of the same battles, many points can be clarified.The 12th SS was a fabulous division of fighting men. I see many training and doctrinal attributes that were used in the Marine Corps when I joined. When viewed in a strictly historical perspective of fighting quality and ability there are few formations that can compare with with the 12th SS. I highly recommend these volumes to historians as well as gamers modeling the battles this division was engaged in."
3,Interesting but flawed,"Good description of battle but goes into details in a somewhat disjointed manner. Hard to tell at times whether point of view of battle is from the German or Allied side. Worth the price and the read if a student of Western Front of European war,"
4,Irony of Creation,"Why did god create mankind? ""Why did he create me?"" could Hedayat ask as well. Hedayat, who was a pessimist with a great sense of humor has written a witfull play, that makes fun of the myth of creation. This book is not antireligious, although one might believe so. It is a very religious one, indeed. But it is against the dogma of all religions, and not only the islamic version of it. The play is not one of Hedayats best books but it figures among his funniest books. A book that believes mankind is more precious to believe in old stories; told by old men who just want some fun.Read it and laugh, couse that is what Hedayat did, when he wrote this joyfull play."
4,Wonderful!,"This book was great. I really enjoyed it and it kept my interest all the way through. I found myself relating to the characters and getting mad at them at the same time, they were so realistic. A good read all in all.. except the prologue was totally unneccessary and had nothing really to do with the rest of the book."
3,Swimming to understand family...,"This book was an easy read, and quite entertaining. It reminds of a book recently read; but I can not place it at the moment. (A story of 3 kids being raised on their own, as their mother is in jail for killing the father. The oldest son trying to find himself... What is the name?) Anyway...I enjoyed the book, as it seems Hershon, took her time writing and going one layer deeper into the lives and personalities of her characters. It starts with the relationship between 2 brothers, wherein we *never* really know what the differences e between them, except ""jealousy"". The relationship turns bad, and the book takes a turn at the same time, focusing on the youngest sister and how she deals with the outcome of one bad night.It's a fun, suspenseful read, as Lila (the youngest) searches for herself, her brother and a better understanding of ""Family"".I would give 3.5 out of 5 stars..."
2,Just OK,"This was not what I expected, given the reviews. Haute Literature it's not, for sure, and I found the pace a bit tedious. Because I have so little time, and every chance I get to read is precious, I was annoyed at the conclusion of this book, as I realized that my time would have been better spent. I was never dying to read it, and I was insulted at the juvenile nature of some of the plot developments, particularly at the end."
4,worth the time to read,"I enjoyed this story - although after the fact - I can see were the story could be whittled down a tad. Still, this story contains an element of mystery that was refreshing in this genre and it did keep me going up to the end."
4,A Great Read!,"I had a hard time putting this book down. Although just a tad slow in places, the book did a good job of letting us get into Lila's head. I agree with another reader that we could have gotten to know some of the other characters in the book better, but as a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was suspenseful and emotional."
3,"Nothing special, beach blanket read","I lived in New Hampshire for four years, so I thought it would be fun to read a book set there. The story was ok...not great, not terrible; it was entertaining, but certainly not prize winning fiction. It's the story of two brothers, one girlfriend, an accident?, and how a little sister responds to it, both immediately and later in her life. On the jacket, it's described as, ""exquisitely sexual,"" which leaves me puzzled and bemused. Sure, okay, if that's what it takes to sell the book, put it on the jacket. Perhaps somebody else will find it more arousing than I did."
5,Worth every penny and minute spent,"I was not here during the feminists revolution and all that. I was also brought up a christian and although devout, have costantly had this battles going on about my place in christianity.This book had the ""balls"" to ask those questions I've always been afraid to even think about. It's funny to see the date when this book was published and to know that after all those years, women still have to battle to be heard. But then, women have come a long way too. I'm glad this book was written. I'm even more glad that I read it. Every woman worth her salt should read it. Because with the questions comes the answers and with the answers comes true freedom. ""The truth shall make you free""."
2,Disappointed,I am definitely disappointed with this candle. I like the smell but it is not that strong for what you think that a $67 (with shipping and everything else) candle of this size should have. It also burned VERY uneavenly even though I maintained the wick at the reccommended levels. Initially when I lit the candle the wick was so deep in the wax that it wouldn't light without some burning of the wax away. The glass votive is clean and crisp and looks nice anywhere in the house. When I do burn it I like the smell but I wish that it was more powerful. I like the Fig smell better but this is okay. For the value vs. the price I would not purchase this candle again and would not reccommend it to others.
2,Not an uplifting book,I was searching for some reading material that I or a caregiver who comes to my home could read to my mother. She is not able to see well enough to read and has the beginnings of dementia...I thought the stories would be happy and uplifting...I have only read a couple but both were rather dull and did not have a strong story line. I have had two of her caregivers complain that the stories were depressing and that the the book was strange....maybe it was not exactly what I was looking for...something to entertain and uplift the spirits....may not be what you are looking for.
1,Garbage,"I wouldn't waste your money on this set-up. Keyboard is very basic and functional, but the mouse.... Absolutely horrible. Too small for a normal hand but the performance is what drove me to return this. Jerky, laggy response time, no matter where you placed the transmitter or what surface you had the mouse on.I expected better from Logitech. Avoid this one at all costs."
4,Nice product,"I bought one of these for a 1983 El Camino which, of course, has no cupholders. The console looks nice and is well made, with plenty of room inside. It's too wide to fit perfectly between the seatbelts, which is why I gave it only 4 stars."
4,Mustard is always good!,This mustard makes all things you eat it on taste better. I love all the flavors this brand supplies. I very much wish that Amazon could offer a variety pack. I suspect that sales would be greater than anticipated. I love this product. I would give the entire operation five stars for a variety pack. Skeez
2,Subtle Smoke,"I purchased this product because I love the flavor of smoked foods and good mustard.The name...Jack Daniels ""Hickory"" smoked...whoa sounded great! Unfortunatley the smoke flavor is too subtle,and flat.There is also quite a bit of sodium per serving. Now I am stuck with 5 bottles languishing in my pantry. Maybe I will try making salad dressing?"
3,"Comment only on Franck Prelude, Chorale & Fugue","I have three versions of the Cesar Franck Prelude, Chorale & Fugue and I unfortunately must report that this Rubinstein recording is notably inferior to the versions by Julius Katchen and the more recent one by Evgeny Kissin. Rubinstein is a pianist whom I greatly admire but this interpretation doesn't have the coherence and lusciousness that Katchen brings to the work nor the technical strength, modern recorded sound or the well-conceived polyphonic interplay in the Fugue demonstrated by Kissin. It's OK but not better than that. Three stars."
2,Not up to par,I bought 2 Johnny Mack Brown westerns Lawman and Code of the Saddle and I must say they are not up to Amazon's fine standards for dvd's. The pictures in some of the frames were so washed out and fuzzy you could hardly make out the faces at all.They looked more like the old vcr tapes than remastered dvd's.Jim Ciampa
2,Bleak and weak,"I rented this movie just yesterday as the blurb on the back of the DVD sounded promising, and I have always loved Nick Nolte. Once I watched it, I wish I had my money and my 2 hours back. This movie is trying way to hard to to be an ""art movie"", but just comes across as pretentious nonsense. The only thing it has going for it is that the visuals can be starkly beautiful at times, even if the aesthetic that the movie is striving for is not very original. Of course it is entirely possible that I just don't ""get"" the movie, but as a whole, I found the movie to be weak and boring. Save your time and your cash."
1,"Did you see ""Neighbors?""....","I watched this last night and felt extremely disappointed that I had by the end. I had seen a coming attraction while watching another DVD and put it at the top of my Netflix que. As soon as it came, we watched it. My girlfriend fell asleep before it was half way through. I wished I had.Just like ""Neighbors,"" all the good parts of the movie seemed to be in the coming attraction."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz,"Beautiful cinematography and music as well as a cast of well known actors, this movie has it all...except that it is painfully boring. I fell asleep several times and could not stay interested no matter how hard I tried. The editing between scenes was very fragmented and the story moved sooooooo slowly. I did not enjoy this one very much at all."
3,Indeed Odd,"I fully agree that this movie was odd. This was our first experience with the Polish brothers. Throughout the movie my husband kept asking now who is that? Whose house is that? We compared it to ""Vanilla Sky"" which we also walked out of the theater going ""Oookay and Huh?"" It was a good movie though. Incited discussion."
1,"A movie about nothing, except it isn't funny.","This film has some interesting features: It is visually stunning, due to the spectacular Montana landscape and excellent cinematography. The actors are quite good, especially Nick Nolte and Darryl Hannah. Hannah's acting skills are improving as she ages.Otherwise, the plot is vacuous and the script ludicrous, so much so that I would have given it zero stars if Amazon allowed it. It was painful to see good actors trying to make something out of the incoherent script.Lots of people like this movie, so I hate to dismiss it completely. But I just couldn't get involved in it, and I get involved in movies - even TV commercials - very easily. There was something forced and not genuine about it, as though the Polish Brothers are taking themselves too seriously. They might make better films if they remembered that the first goal of movie-making is to entertain."
1,Pointless,"This movie was a crap-sandwich.If movies are meant to entertain, this one could be classified as torturous. Between struggling not to nod off and trying figure out what in the world the ""angels"" were doing, the ending could not come soon enough.This is the only review I've written on a movie on Amazon, so I feel pretty strongly about it. Very poor... I would place it in the same category as ""Knockaround Guys"", ""Ronin"", and ""The Yards"". Just pointless, pseudo-intellectual rubbish."
4,Strangely affecting,"I give the filmmakers credit for originality and full execution of their beautiful, droll, and distinctly American vision. American cinema is not strong on surrealism, but this is a worthy foray into the genre. There is a Dali-esque beast that inhabits the landscape which is absolutely inspired. The use of imagery and symbolism is very sophisticated, and the camera work is deft. There were times when I found it all a bit excruciating, but my attention was always refocused by some witty vignette or gorgeous scrap of scenery. The child who plays the angel is a heartrending presence and brings the only pathos to an otherwise ironic and detached narrative. Northfork certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for me it ultimately soared."
1,SOMEBODY CALL GHOSTBUSTERS!,"I feel like I've been strapped to a chair and forced to watch an entire season of TV's ""Touched By An Angel"". What fluffy goody-good nonsense this film is. Bumbling eccentric angels have to be one of the thinnest fictional devices ever revealed in the movies and this group make Casper the Friendly Ghost look like a Dicken's spirit. I sat there waiting for this film to click into gear for quite some time until it became apparent this movie is a watershed of indifference concerning the afterlife in a small dying American town soon to be turned into a lake. As if the dumb angels weren't enough, we have worldly government agents in black trenchcoats and a Christ-like child looking for his wings which is much less compelling than Peter Pan looking for his shadow. Writer, director, and star, The Polish Brothers ought to row, row, row their boat in any other direction."
2,Not my *cup of tea*,"I typically enjoy complicated, thought provoking films. 45 minutes into the movie I was totally clueless. I stopped the DVD 1/2 way through the film and went to the ""special features"" to watch the documentary & background about the directors. That helped, a little. I still don't get a lot of the symbolism & I was anticipating a dramatic flood scene at the end that never came.I appreciate the beautiful cinematography and I think I appreciate the director's intentions. The wonderful performances of James Woods, Nick Nolte, Daryl Hannah, Anthony Edwards deserve acknowledgement. Sadly, NORTHFORK left me with an empty, unresolved feeling. A feeling that NORTHFORK could have been better."
2,Mushroom Therapy,"Psychotropic drugs don't come close to the kind of trip this film gives you. I found it bizarre and a bit creepy at the same time. I managed to sit through the entire film, hoping for redemption of it's weird storyline, but it never came. I doubt I'll watch it again. Two stars because of two stars: Nick Nolte and James Woods."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This is not only the silliest but also the most meaningless move I've ever watched. It's not worth what you pay for it, so just don't buy it because you'll be sadly disappointed."
4,beautiful,"This is a very beautiful, but rather confusing movie. You feel the progress of the plot in your emotions, but you're not quite sure what the progress is. Nevertheless if you think, you can piece together a general idea of what it's about, and a general idea is all you really need to watch something (if you're in doubt, watch Akira or spend some time as a working immigrant). The movie feels slow, but when it's over it seems very short, and you wish it lasted longer. It has a soundtrack of haunting music box melody, oldtime 50s tunes (we are not speaking of rock music), and one other style, used to great effect in one of the funny parts. The overall mood is melancholy, but also often very beautiful; sometimes pensive; sometimes a sense of wonder; sometimes very funny and sometimes dry. This movie has something for everyone, and is mixed and out there enough for everyone to think it is weird. You'll be glad you watched it, but no one else will be able to predict why you'll feel that way."
3,"Don't know if it's good, and I watched the whole thing!!","I rented this movie tonight because it seemed interesting---and it was. However, I watched some scenes numerous times thinking that I must have missed something, but no, it's just really weird. You know how sometimes it takes a while into a movie for everything to come together? Well that never happens here. The whole concept deals with death, but the scenes change so often that you can't really tell what's real or what's a dream. What was that weird monster thing that got shot by the tranquilizer gun? Anyway, I'd recommed watching it, just for the sake that it is different, but when you start to get a little confused, don't expect to get any answers."
2,Strange for Strange's sake,"My wife and I dislike the ""typical"" popcorn fluff movies that come out of Hollywood these days, preferring instead something that makes you think about your own life's experiences and such.Having said that, you might think we would have liked NORTHFORK, unfortunately this is one of those ""artsy-fartsy"" type movies where the writers and directors go out of their way to be strange just for the sake of being strange without really ever putting anything to celluloid that draws you in or is memorable.I must confess, we tried watching this movie 3 times and never got further than 50 minutes or so into it.... just couldn't stand it anymore.Feel like getting introspective and deep ?Go sit outside late tonight and stare up at the stars pondering the origins and meaning of life... you will probably find this to be more entertaining passage of 2 hours of your life."
1,"Absolutely the worst movie I have ever sat through, no exception!!!","This movie is pointless, bizarre , inane, and totally without merit. I guess you would have to be as weird as the script writer to understand this movie. I thought I had broad tastes in movies and story lines, but this one just escaped me.......... James Woods, Nick Nolte, shame on you!"
2,New Age,"I (unfortunately) was seduced by the jacket presentation of the DVD. Between dreams and dark reality, the film finds it difficult to take the course. Some sensitive images avoid the viewer from being engulfed by waves of fatigue.A film truly boring and fake due to its seduction by the New Age."
5,Pretty Cool,"This isn't for those who like Nirvana solely for ""Teen Spirit"" and all that junk... My girlfriend laughs at me because I like to play this in my car, but really, it's quite different and very fun to hear the classic Nevermind performed in this way. A good aspect of it is that I can listen to Nirvana while studying... it helps me because there's no words in it whatsoever... i dont know... anyway, pick this up if youre a Nirvana fan... pretty cool and very worthwhile!! :)6"
1,"Solid content, formatted POORLY for Kindle","The Schaum series contains solid content for the beginning piano student. I was tickled to see it available for Kindle -- nice for me to have on hand, another option for new students (or their parents). The notation for the songs is so poorly formatted it might as well be unreadable. I'm having trouble, and I have the songs memorized. No way would I put the Kindle edition in front of a student, and frankly, it's not worth the money for me even as a reference. I didn't ""save"" 25%, I wasted 100% of what I spent on the Kindle version. Pbbt. This is a case where the hard copy is worth it."
3,Nice design but shipping damage.,"The three stars are for the shipping otherwise I would have given a five star rating. Due to the manufacturer's packing, four of the glasses were broken. Amazon shipped another box for free but they too arrived with four broken glasses. However, between the two shipments we had a full matching set.The glasses are well designed. My wife finally has a matching set for our guests. Very nice."
5,bosch belt sander fence & bench mount,These accessories are very useful additions to this belt sander allowing the user to bench mount the sander with the belt horizontal or vertical to guide narrow edges or small work-pieces for finish (or other) sanding. Excellent for sanding shoe-molding or baseboard returns flush with the back edge. I can't believe how useful this versatile belt sander is - I waited WAY TOO LONG to purchase this excellent tool. It could have saved me many hours of hand sanding!
2,Poor quality for Bosch,"This fence appears to be flimsy. I use the term ""appears to be"" for good reason--it was packed with no instructions (and none are available from Bosch's web site or by phoning or emailing). Based on the illustration I can infer that the bolt packed with my unit is too short for its intended use. Even if it assembled correctly, there's only one attachment point and that would probably be too inaccurate for precision work--I can do just as well freehand. Altogether not up to Bosch's normally fine standards. This one is going back.PS: I love the 1274DVS belt sander, and have used it for years.PPS: after a week I finally was sent the instruction sheet. Too late--my need for this part has passed, and all my other points still stand (see above.)"
5,wonderful poems,"I read these poems to my 3 children when they were little. When the were old enough so that I had a little time, I set all of these poems to music. As a piano teacher, I made them progressively more difficult, working with these poems and then many more wonderful poems written for children. I made 2 books of 24 poems, including all of these, and had them beautifully illustrated. The students get a real aesthetic experience while they learn how to read notes. The students learn the piano and also learn great poetry. (I got permission to use all these poems). I am indebted to all these poets for their wonderful work that makes my teaching and my students' learning so enjoyable."
5,personally speaking...,"Our family loved this book! When our children were very small, they memorized every poem in this book - they liked it that much! They still talk about how they enjoyed this book now that they are starting families of their own :) Cheers"
5,Dallas Cowboy's Grill Cover,The Grill cover was a surprise gift for my husband who was very happy with it. It's been over a year since I've purchased this order and the grill cover was over the grill outside all winter long still in good condition and we are pleased. I would order from this company again
2,I was disappointed,"This, and all of the ""Music for..."" series consist mostly of 1940's 'old-timey' recordings transferred to CD, with very little (if any) remastering. If you are looking for relaxing background music, this is not a very good choice. If you're on a budget, ""the intro collection"" box sets, also sold through Amazon, is much better."
3,Too many books!,"There are 5 volumes for this Paramedic Care series! It's a bit much, and could have been made easier. The authors have a lot of duplicate information throughout the books, which becomes irritating for the student. I found myself reading the same text in different volumes on many occasions. Some of the wording can be a little tricky when it doesn't have to be.It's not a terrible series, but I would hope there's something better out there."
1,"Too much crude, not enough message","I purchased this DVD in hopes of having a supplement for my discussions about stranger safety and awareness when speaking with my children, but was very disappointed. There was an absurd amount of flatulent type ""humor"" and not enough about the message of stranger safety. I threw this DVD into the trash."
5,First-Class Classical Saxophone Recording,Lynn Klock's third CD for the Open Loop record label demonstrates the musical range and beauty that can be expressed on a saxophone. The Bozza and Ibert are particularly strong performances. I would recommend this album to anyone who is unfamiliar with the classical saxophone repertoire as well as serious players who will find these interpretations to be quite enjoyable.
3,king size dub chapter 6,"this cd is a very uneven mix. various artists compilations can certainly tend that way, and this one goes to the extreme. there are 4 cuts i like on this one, and a lot that's pretty weak, in my opinion. the strengths:smith & mighty; black star liner; g. corp remix of bob marley; seeed. but i think it's worth it for the strength of those 4, at least for myself as a dj. i would probably have bought it just for the marley remix alone, to be honest. & ""million deadtongues"" by seeed is very fine. one needs a relatively broad definition of ""dub"" to get into this comp--it's definitely more new school, as much as one can generalize about such an uneven collection of songs."
3,Good but wanted more,"A nice inspiration source for charming, rustic country french design. I wanted more out of the book though - perhaps photos of full rooms rather than vignettes of tables and kitchen counters. It makes it hard to get a sense of design style without a full room effect in my opinion. The book does ooze charm and if you have other books on this style and just want a little extra something this would be ok. If however you really need a good book to learn all about french country style I would not suggest this one."
2,"Do what they need to do, but...","...they are really REALLY stiff. I am a huge fan of extension cords that play nice with a person who tries to take care in wrapping them up. These particular cords don't sit well on their own and are pretty stubborn when trying to make a nice wrapped loop. If that isn't an issue for you, then you'll probably have no problems with these. I bought 4 and decided to go with something else. I'll probably donate them since I can't return them."
3,Recorded At Slightly Too-Fast Speed,"I bought the first pressing of this when it was released. On playing the disc, I immediately noticed that the speed of these videos has been altered. They play just a little fast (compare the audio to the CD or the vinyl). Once you notice this, it's really irritating. Hopefully, Rhino fixed this problem on later pressings, but you should be aware of it."
4,"""Right Spectacle"" unexpectedly entertaining","I picked this up used at a record show this weekend for $8. I haven't even watched it all the way through yet and already I feel like I scored a tremendous bargain!I am very appreciative of EC but not one of your obsessive fans. Even so, I enjoyed watching the many videos I'd never seen before, along with Elvis' written commentary appearing as subtitles. I can't wait to watch it again with the audio commentary.The negative comments I've read in other reviews about the audio and video quality are valid (there are hundreds of other crappy Eighties videos airing daily on VH1 with the same issues), but these issues are not so distracting as to make the videos unwatchable.Buy it new and it's a good value. Buy it used and it's the steal of the century ..."
3,For Fans Only,"This DVD has twenty-seven videos; six tunes, including the brilliant ""So Like Candy"", didn't appear on the VHS tape. Unfortunately, the audio or video has not been enhanced so it's no better than the tape. However, Elvis provides a sparse commentary track for each video, and there is 66 minutes of live material broken up into seven segments. Problem is you can't play them all at once... that is, after each segment it defaults back to the bonus menu. The live material has some old footage but the performances range from quite sloppy to superb so this disc is probably for fans only."
5,Beautifully divine wisdom for the beautifully hearted...,"This is by far my favorite card edition of Don Miguel's books.I would recommend buying every card deck as well as every book ever produced by this wonderful angel. Point being though, I found this deck to be the most useful for me and I recommend it to anyone, even if you don't own or have never read any of his books or cards. You will find much useful, practical, and easily understandable wisdom which can bring you out of depression, free you of lies in your belief system, and of course promote love within and without. Please buy this card deck, you will not be dissapointed. Elliott"
5,Awesome,THese cards sit right next to my keybaord at work. They are absolutley a must for a morning guindance or a mid-day pick me up. I love Miguel. He is so empowering.
3,Not as pictured!,"Like several other reviewers, I ordered based on the picture (which shows an Oster ""bubble pack""). The gaskets I got came loose in an envelope, and are not quite the same size as the original (same outside diameter, but a bit wider). They will probably work, but I don't think they are the original Oster part and I didn't get what I was expecting."
2,"Fun to read, but filled with errors......","As a native Italian with many years of cooking experience, I am always looking for books to expand my knowledge and buy whatever reference books become available. I bought this sight unseen, and was a little upset when I reviewed terms that I am intimately familiar with, only to see them misinterpreted. I could site many examples of this, not the least of which being the definition cited for lampredotto, a unique type of tripe that any Florentine would know, (not the roll it is served on)...Mr. Mariani, you needed to do more research!"
5,The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink,"I would recommend this book for anyone who is serious about how to pronounce Italian correctly, and who wants to know the history and meaning of the words. Well written, a gem. I have purchased a copy from Amazon for two of my sons who are serious Italian food lovers."
5,havent seen it but now it will be great...,"This dvd will be truly awesome because not only its the end of a great epic but it will feature some really great fights and off course the music will be jaw dropping (big music fan here lol), can't wait for this dvd, obviously buy the 9 dvd's before this.The day of destiny: May 10th \m/ ^_^ \m/"
5,"Perfect product, light and easy to use: plastic on one side","We wanted spent high that did not fill the whole room, but a good 4 feet width, something light and not heavy to drag around the room, or even for storage! We could be more happy with this item: light and very effective. It has a blue plastic on one side, and light canvas cloth on the other side (great as it provided a grip on our hardwood floor and didn't slide around once we were painting). The blue plastic was effective, no leakages to other side and we found the width was perfect as it caught all our splatter from using a roller and brush. Much much better than getting those with plastic on both sides. Love it and highly recommend."
2,Beveridge Translation,Two stars is for not providing information on the translation. I was hoping for the McNiell translation.
5,Essential for Everyone Interested in Christian Theology,"Despite the negative connotations associated with John Calvin, this book is absolutely amazing. If you are interested at all in growing your knowledge and understanding of the Christian faith, this book is a must. It covers the entire systematic theology of the great ""founding father"" of Protestant Christianity.I can ramble on about how much I appreciate this book. But take my advice:No matter what your beef is with those who believe in Reformed Theology, lay it aside and read this. It will take time and lots of effort (it was written in the 16th Century, when every word was meaningful), but it is worth it. There is a reason his theology has remained. Find that out for yourself. (I promise, it won't kill you)."
4,a good improvement,A linked table of contents has been added for each section. Base font is a bit smallish but no big deal. Footnoes do not have a direct link but again this is fine. A terrific value for a timeless work.
4,good read,"This book was a gift to someone. They haven't finished reading it yet, but told me that what they've read so far has been quite ""instructive"". He called it a ""good read""."
1,Institutes: Christian Religion by John Calvin,"FYI: The sample had a Table of Contents & it was easy to navigate in. When i bought the book, there is no Index & no way to navigate 272 pages."
5,Well done version for the Kindle,"After trying my hand at a cheaper kindle version of ""Institutes"", I highly recommend this version instead because it was professionally produced for the Kindle including:- a Table of Contents which appears in the Kindle menu. This is essential for navigating such a large and complex text - 4 books and dozens of chapters.- Greek text displayed correctly.- Footnotes all linked from within this text. With several hundred footnotes, again, this is an essential feature to have.By the way, this indeed is the Beveridge translation which, in my opinion, is much better than the Battles-McNeill translation since the language is truer to Calvin's original (and better reflects Calvin's hard hitting style, in my opinion)."
3,Used Copy - Good Book and Fit the Budget,"I've wanted a copy of this for a long time. I bought a used copy and regret that decision. The price was great, but I'm going to want to keep a copy of this for the rest of my life and will read it multiple times. I would rather not have a copy that someone decided to mark up with a highlighter.Excellent book - one of the greats. This version has a great binding and is comfortable to read."
4,Fantastic value,"An excellent translation and abridgment which does not lose any of the original thoughts of Calvin. Love him or hate him, his approach to Scripture has been transformative to the understanding of grace in the Christian community, and this copy is fantastic. The Kindle edition is nicely rendered, and for $0.99, this is hard to beat."
3,Slow read but informative,"This for the die-hard theologian. Good read, but very slow and dense. Would recommend for anyone that already has a strong background in theology and wants to challenge their knowledge base."
5,A great buy,"No doubt this book was the most influential source of theological influence in the protestant movement, and needless to say essential for any student of religion to read and own a copy of. I take issue with anyone that rates this book down due to dislike for the doctrine of predestination, despite Calvin's perspective still being the most coherent and comprehensive theological analysis ever written (compare it in length to Aquinas' Summa and you'll see what I mean).The price is incredibly convenient although it probably will not last twenty years as binded. Especially good for students."
2,Concerned,"I don't own this edition. I have the Library of Christian Classics (2 Volume Set) edition of the Institutes. At St. John's College, however, I've encountered many of my fellow students who have purchased this edition because of its price and quality at first glance. I admit that the price is amazing for such a large volume, but the editing is poor. The first printing of this edition has a glaring typo on the binding: the INSTITIUTES of the Christian Religion. Yikes. There are also several grammatical flaws in the translation. If you just want to cheaply plow through Calvin, you're fine with this. But if you appreciate fine quality books, go for the Library of Christian Classics one (twice as expensive), or get the paperback edition."
2,Great size but finish scratches,"These 9"" plates are the perfect size for a reasonable meal. However, I'm disappointed with the wear. After only a couple of months, the white plates are completely scratched. I wouldn't use them now for guests."
5,A Perfect Gift For Dads!,"DADDY PROMISES makes a wonderful gift for dads. I just gave a copy to a friend who has recently become a dad. He loves the book, and his daughter couldn't take her eyes off of the illustrations. My hat is off to Kevin McCain who drew the most touching pictures of dads and their children that I have ever seen. And, to Kerry Arquette who knows what promises dads can make, and how special they are to their children.Don't miss this book. It's a treasure for dads and their children."
4,Beautiful writing,"The writer displays masterful command of language, and has created a poignant, beautiful work. The illustrations complement the prose very nicely. This is a book that I can imagine fathers reading to their children time and again. However, I feel that the religious messages feel ""tacked on"" and detract from the impact that the book might have otherwise achieved. This is not a book I could share with students in my second grade classroom, and might not be appropriate in households of other faiths. While the publisher may have wanted this Christian prose to be included, I find it unfortunate that this book could not have been written to appeal to a wider audience."
2,"Just cubes, no drawers and different sized openings.","If you are like me and you thought that 1) You were going to end up with 3 same sized cubes, you are wrong. 2) Or that this unit is designed to hold 3 each Closet made fabric drawers, you are wrong. What a horrible design, what a horrible unit. You can make it work and fit two of the Closet maid foldable cloth drawers inside this unit with a short shelf space left for a book or something, but even then the two openings for the drawers are different sizes, look stupid, not uniform and the whole thing is super flimsy throughout! It would have been just as easy to design and manufacture a unit that takes 3 of the Closetmaid fabric drawers that they always sell right next to this unit, but instead somebody just decided to screw it all up. What a waste of my money and time, gotta pack up the whole mess and return it to the store."
4,Nice Storage,This shelving unit is attractive and convenient. It only holds two of the larger baskets but the little bit of room at the bottom will hold slippers!!
4,Chihuly: DVD Collection,Wonderful and informative collection of insights into the life of the best-known artist working with glass today.
3,"Por qué no dice ""versión en concierto"" ?","Sí. La compilación es muy buena; pero, lo que no me gusta es que los compiladores de OBRAS CUMBRES no te digan por ningún lado (solo hasta cuando abres el disco) que en cuanto a las canciones ""Sobredosis de TV"", ""Cuando pase el temblor"" y ""Signos"" que éstas canciones vienen en versión en vivo (en concierto) y no en la versión del album... Entonces si te interesa tener esta canciones dentro de una compilación pero en su versión original (no en concierto) busca en otro lado...Ahora, si ya tienes el album y quieres nuevas versiones...pues sí."
1,WASTE OF PAPER,"If it were possible to rate this book with less than one star I would have done so. I purchased and read this book hoping for some insight which would help me prepare for my daughter's IEP. I wish I had spent the time reading this book organizing my closets or on some worthy endeavor as I feel that the time I spent reading was wasted. I found this book to oversimplify the necessary elements of an IEP and of the IDEA. For parents who have never been through an IEP, this will not give them much assistance. I much prefer the Wrightslaw publications, as they are much more thorough and better outline the children's rights."
2,Disappointed,"I found this book was overrated and lumpy. I found more concise and useful information in WrightsLaw. This book talks about a non-existent world of school administrators, and impractical and misleading sunny little paragraphs about what to do, like they will actually work. The brief sojourn into methodology is glaringly misinformed, ignoring 40 years of Applied Behavioral Analysis, OT, Speech and other therapies with a dismissive paragraph about Lovaas Method vs. TEACCH. This book is long-winded other places where a tactful editor could have made it a lot easier to read and understand. The best part was the index of common phrases, the cute case examples about kids and the list of other books to read. Some of the copy came off as insulting too, like parents are slow-witted and need help in understanding everything, so speak slowly. Wished I'd spent the money on something else."
3,Good For Younger Kids,"This book is good for children who will be acquiring mice in the future, but definetely the parent or guardian of the child should absolutely check out/buy some more in-depth books geared toward seriously conscientious mouse-keepers. This book is really only for the child in the situation to have something to briefly educate themselves with. Children over seven should read something more difficult and at their level.Other wise, this book is stellar, and it is especially nice because of the emphasis that mice need to be taken to vet on occasion, too. A good book for younger readers."
2,I guess this book is ok if you want to know about intimacy,"For those of you who want to buy this book and you think by intimacy, the title is alluding to sex, you're wrong it's not. Very few things, like 2 or 3 can be found in this book about the church's view on marital sex. Those 2 or 3 things couldn't be farther apart from each other or more vague. If you really want to know what the church thinks and you can't wait until right before you get married, ask a couple who was married in the temple or some one who has received instruction about such matters from a bishop or someone like that."
4,"Good stuff, needs one thing",This is a nice tutorial and accurate! it does need a jam track of each song at the end of the lesson so that you can put it all together before jamin' with the dead. I hope that they are doing another!!!
5,Great,The dvd got here on time. I havent opened the package yet because i've been busy. I am giving the seller the benefit of the doubt that all is well with the dvd.
5,It's hard to get excited about pool cartridges,"They were what I ordered, what I needed, and they came quicker UPS than promised. Let me add a lot cheaper than purchasing at the local Leslies pool supplies store. Good value and customer service. I'm happy, which my general attitude about my poolis it's a waste of time and money."
1,Wrong Filter,A wrong filter was sent and I everytime I try to contact the company it sends me to a voice mail and I never got a call back.
3,ok..but there is better,Easy to attach but needs to be brighter. The metal TLR1 is a finer choice and can be dropped and handles water better.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was disappointed to find out that there was a LOT more highlighting then advertised!! Almost every Chapter has some and quite a few are almost the whole chapter itself!!! If I had known I would not have purchased,or at least returned, unfortunately I needed the book for a class pronto."
4,Works great,"Bought as an additional power extension for my vacume, works great indoor and outdoor, just about the correct length for my usage. Only thing is that its a little heavy when shipping so u pay almost 3/4 additional price for that."
4,Good All Around Extenstion Cord,"Needed a second extension cord. Checked prices at retail stores, ebay, etc. Decided for the money this looked like the one. Have not been disappointed. Plus, since it is green it comes in hand at christmas time."
3,Decent cord for the price...but gets stiff in cold weather,"I got this to span across my driveway to my snowmobile trailer, after the snow plow guy massacred the last one I had. The last cord I have had for some years and do not know the manufacturer, but it was orange, and stayed very pliable - the same as room temp - in any ambient temps. This coleman cable does serve it's purpose - it works as an extension cord - but when I had it running across the driveway for a few days last week in cold winter temps (10-15F), I was unable to coil it very easily, it was pretty much frozen stiff. Hope that info helps someone, other than the cold stiffness issue, it's a perfectly good cord."
4,It Works,"Works just fine and plenty long for my needs. What are you waiting for? If you need it, get it, you probably won't beat the price."
4,Civil War Ghost Stories,"Gift for my husband. He really liked it! The cover was a little messed up, but it looked like this was from the post-office because the envelope was a little messed up too. Overall, great purchase."
3,Not what I thought,"The stories are good, but they are long. I was looking for some short stories to tell at a Halloween story telling event. The service provided by the vendor was very good."
5,HIdden Treasure,"Evans did not want this record released - it first hit stores after his death. I would guess that he considered this a step backwards in his career. The level of interplay on the original Village Vangard recordings set a high standard that this session never quite attains. Relatively few bass and drum solos create a piano-centric dynamic reminiscent of Evans' first two albums (Conceptions and Everybody Digs...) However, viewed in isolation, this is a great album. Evans plays with a bottomless reserve of flair end energy, with nary a weak moment or wasted note. ""Philly"" Joe Jones keeps the fire lit under Evans all night long (this is a LONG single CD) and throws in a few memorable rhythmic curve balls. Gomez's solos sound surprisingly like Scott LaFaro. Though it never tops Sunday at the Village Vanguard, California Here I Come compares very favorably with Evans' early trio recordings."
2,Wearysome notation,"I bought this text because it seemed to cover all the topics in which I was interested. Alas, the coverage is far from uniform and the notation is constantly changing. No point in requesting clarification directly from Peacock. In reply to, ""some symbols are used before they are defined,"" you'll be told that ""the meanings of the symbols are well known to any physics undergraduate."" Complain that one of those well-known symbols seems to have an entirely different meaning in some other section of the text, and you'll be told to look at such and such an equation for the new definition. Mathematicians who have their own set of standard symbols, such as ^ for the outer product will find themselves completely baffled.Text lacks all mention of loop quantum gravity."
1,Possibly the worst book that I own,"This book is possibly the worst book that I own. I found it totally incomprehensible. The other reviewer must have only flipped through the book and not attempted to read it. I admit that the book looks good when flipping through it, but don't be decieved.This book was used in a cosmology class that I took, but was abandoned after 1 week because it was so bad.Try to find another book!"
4,"Under Barry Goldwater, how Arizona grew from a desert",This is an easily readable and well balanced biography of a man whose love of the land where he was born enabled him to guide the development of the state to its economic heights of today. Tthe author is a history professor at Arizona State. He has well researched his material and had access to Goldwater's papers as well. A fine gift for Democrat or Republican or anyone interested in the development of the state.
5,femme is rad!!,this girl is the raddest most beutiful girl on the planet!!! you have gott to see this movie if nothing else but for femm! femm! femm! the special effex are rad to.
5,mutants. damn.,"I really like this movie. Good comedy, and lots of gore. It's like apple pie and cheese...or something like that."
5,You MUST own this if you love Bruce!,"When Bruce put his two DVDs out I had to run out and buy a DVD player so I could view them. They are still the only two DVDs I own and it was well worth the $200 for the DVD player! All of us Bruce fans know that he NEVER disappoints us...This will make you feel like you are right in the room with Bruce, Patti and the guys as they record ""Blood Brothers"". This is a must have for your collection!By the way - today happens to be his birthday (Happy 52 Bruce!)"
5,Great Look At Band Reunion!!,A must have if you are a fan of Springsteen; reunion recording session at the Hit Factory. Reveals the greatness of this band and the painstaking recording process of the band. First time Nils Lofgren actually records with the band.
5,The Future Now And Then,"Another amazing tale from the master. I'm surprised Venus isn't as described, considering all the other details Heinlein wrote about correctly in his time. And it's a great human story, as well."
4,Timeless as the Stars,"I read this item when I was twelve. It filled me not with a sense of wonder per se, but with a vision of what it means to be a part of something greater than myself, an ideal that needed to be upheld. Now, at twenty, I still consider those values of worth. In a world filled with Harry Potter and Video Games, where is the voice of inspiration for young people to hear? Potter is just fine for fantasy readers, but not all of us are. As an avid reader within the library field, with experience dealing with young adult readers my point is: This story is just as valid today as when it was written. Perhaps even more than that, it is necessary in an age when the only time virtues of humanity are extolled to teens is in a generally didactic manner, or one assuming they will not listen. This work displays good moral character in a non-confrontational way that lets young readers admire the characters of Matt Dodson and Tex, while disliking the ways of the morally bankrupt Burke."
3,"A little outdated, but still enjoyable Heinlein","This is basically a young adult novel. A little youthful for adults, unless you're a die-hard Heinlein fan. It's a little outdated, as well, however Heinlein never really disappoints."
3,Fair to middlin,"This was okay, not the greatest, but I think it was considered a jeuvenile, so whatcha whatcha whatcha want?If I had to guess I would say this was probly one of the Boys Life serials - judging from the form and content, it seems likely, and I can see why you might want to go tailoring the tale to the audience.Still, there is no chance of this joining Dark is the Sun - on my read over and over and over and over list, but the Pokeman mentality has me - Gotta read em all..."
5,Awesome Book!,"I read this book for a graduate school class and thought it was really amazing. First it is interesting to read about the differences between women living in India, a group of people that a western gaze tends to homogenize. It also shows the struggles that NGO's face, and the conflicts between the bureaucrats of those who run the NGO's and the real women who work for them. I would highly reccommend this book if you are interested in third world feminism, NGO's, and reading about real women's lives."
3,Gentle and peaceful--tape version worth 3.5 stars,"I have the cassette version of this album--it does not show the times of the pieces, but it's pretty short--certainly less than an hour of music. The playing of Rampal (flute) & Laskine (harp) is lovely, but the sound quality of the tape could be better. The music is gentle, lilting, peaceful--good for relaxing, meditation, etc. Interestingly, I was reading a chapter by Buddhist/Psychoanalyst Mokusen Miyuki (in ""Buddhism and Jungian Psychology"" 1561841110 by Marvin Spiegelman & Miyuki) at the time of listening to this tape. People interested in this album might also like ""Music for Flute and Harp"" B000005E92 also performed by Rampal and Laskin."
4,Cobalt luncheon plate ~,"I love Fiesta and have pieces in many colors, including cobalt, and it is one of my favorite colors. It's a beautiful rich color that goes with everything.There's a problem with this plate: there is no Fiesta stamp. The plate looks exactly like my other luncheon plates except for that and I'm keeping it for that reason but downgrading it a star. I'm accepting it on faith that it is authentic because it came wrapped in bubble wrap that was sealed with the Fiesta sticker.I find the 9"" luncheon plates to be the best size for most meals, especially if you enjoy using extra salad and/or bread plates. The dinner size plate is more of a buffet size."
5,Inspiring story of a pioneering woman educator.,"This is a great biography of Rosemond Tuve, a remarkable woman scholar, who began life on the prairies of South Dakota and rose to honor and acclaim in the United States and Europe.This inspiring story is a reflection on education and the rewards of the life of the mind. Believing that education is a series of transformative experiences - she had a profound impact on all who knew her. I highly recommend this insightful, engrossing new biography of a truly remarkable woman."
3,Variation on a theme,"I can recommend this book for a statistical reference and a factual source. The image are fairly good and some are really new, since they show the assault gun in factories and in dismantle view. You can follow the development of the assault gun even to the slihtest detail. In that optic this book is aim at the modeller and the detail devotee.And what really, really bug me with all the Schiffer Military books is that they use a old Typo and that mainly all the photography and schema have poor description and use a even worst Typo. It could sound odd, but when you read a manual like this, you dont want to be stress by the Typo.Dont go for this book if you want a photographic reference and avoid at all cost this book if you intend to entertain yourself._________________________Paul Bourgault2Lt/Fus MR21/34thCBG/RCAC"
5,METHOD MAN!!!,"i had this on vhs when i was kid. its also known as method man. o.k, i dont understand people, why do u guys bother to comment on the story line? who cares, its a kung fu flick, 90% of the time the plot is revenge. that gives us reason for all the fighting. now the fighting and acrobatics in this flick is top notch. if u see a kung fu movie with a wu tang rappers name, its probably pretty damn good. why else would they name themselves after a kung fu movie. i cant believe its only a quarter!!! i love being a kung fu collector during these times, its just so damn affordable!!! cant wait for it to come in..."
3,Story does not stay in one place.,"Classic fighting but terrible plot, we usually watch k movies for the action / fighting. This movie is okay for that but the down time is horrible"
3,A Decent Ring,"When I received this ring, I was very excited and surprised, because it was bigger than I expected. The luster of it is a brushed look but the craftsmanship is mediocre at best. I found many imperfections, and because the metal is on the soft side, if you wack it on things, it tends to leave very small indents.Pros: Very cool design. Got many compliments on it, and It is comfortable.Cons: Soft metal, imperfect craftsmanship.Overall, Id say that I liked this ring and it is a very cool accessory, as long as it is cared for. I'd recommend it to a friend."
3,pretty cool,"its a cool ring its interesting, yet its not all ""look at my i want attention"" like those finger armors. people that did see it always thought it was some sort of space ship though. it was one of my favorite rings to wear.but now its broken because of the cheap material its made of. a medium sized math book fell on it and it pretty much pancaked. so as long as nothing gets on top of it, it wont break. but its definatly not worth buying again unless you're one of those rich people/kids"
3,"Like, Wow Man! Pass a Cigarette","This ""documentary"" has its good and insightful points, but ultimately it grows old halfway through. After the first 20 minutes ""Ever Since The World Ended"" feels more like a 60's hippie commune than a group of end of the world survivors. I imagine if you live in San Francisco this film will seem very real, but for those of us outside this culture it comes off as a group of 21st century hippies playing pretend."
1,Too unrealistic,"I don't expect too much from low budget films, but some mistakes are just plain dumb to make.Tiny things like nail polish ruined the feel of it being post-apocalyptic. Long yawn..."
4,A interesting different look at the end,"I liked this movie. That by itself won't make anybody get the DVD but I did. This is the side that you don't see. Most of the time you see action movies about the climactic ending, or maybe roving bands of marauders attacking villages (there is a very brief bit of that) but this movie focuses more on how the rest of scociety deals with the aftermath. In this cas the culpret wasn't a roving band (I'm not going to say what it was). The rest of the people - not the main charactors in the movies. but the other people, what happens to them? This movie focuses on them, but it does it in a way that it makes it seem like it really happened. This movie is made to be a homemade documentwry filmed by future reporters who want to make a name for themselves by explaining what happened, interviewing people, and saying what life is like now. It's a great thought provoking movie. I say that, but who am I? Check it out and decide for yourself>"
4,Well done,"the opening credits turned me off a bit but the rest of teh story carries you along quite nicely. I was realy surprised with how engaging the format was and how entertaining it was too. yes Adam Savage is in it but he's notthe ""star"" so don't watch it just for that. watch it becasue its an engaing and intersting movie that provides a good think."
4,Ever Since the World Ended,This Movie was good as far as good goes but it was a good movie in some frams it will keep you in your chair so to speak I would recamend this movie to anyone over the age of 17.
1,A Cure For Insomnia,"A third grader could have written this movie better. There is basically no story at all, just a bunch of inserted stunts about a guy with no personality. The movie just ends (which is the best part about this movie) without rhyme or reason. If you can't sleep, watch this movie!"
4,civic si transformer,I bought this toy because i just bought the really car in June. This is a very accurate toy model and I was surprised with the details on it. Very happy with the toy and the seller. Item came fast and packaged nicely.
5,Highly entertaining overview of anime fans,"Not certain what the negative reviewers were expecting, but I found OTAKU UNITE! to be a blast. Informative and a hell of a lot of fun, the film should be equally satisfying to both the layman and the longtime fan. Filled with the typical eccentrics (anyone who's ever been to a fan convention will smile in recognition upon seeing these folks), the film takes an amused yet not condescending view, the outcome of the Cos Play being an excellent -- and hilarious -- example.The extras on the DVD are also great, with a goofy-but-fun piece on the film's premiere at the Philadelphia Film Festival, and a breezy but thorough audio commentary. Highly recommended."
2,audio quality issues,"Good collection; sound is rotten. Billed as ""Digitally remastered"" (see, e.g., liner notes), this version has the same severe audio range limitations as the original. I'd been waiting a long time for a CD version, only to find there's NO improvement in sound quality. Bummed."
1,"""Weep for the dead but do not neglect to feed the living.""","I'm not surprised that nobody else has reviewed this episode to date.This episode is as bad as others are good.See my review of Longarm and Big Trouble in Bodie , No.201, that I did on February 16,2006.There were only two pages in the book that came up to the standards of a good Western.That was howLongarm resolved a stand-off in a saloon while he was Police Chief in Addington Texas after the previous Chief had been murdered.However; two pages does not a novel make.As a matter of fact,I found this episode so trashy,that if it had been the first one I read,I would have quit right then and there.Fortunately, after reading 75 or so episodes,I know that most are good to excellent;but this has to be the worst so far for me.I fail to understand that this would have been accepted by the editors, after the high quality of No.201.If this is your first Longarm novel,believe me;most are far superior to it."
5,Access Points,This access point is a very satisfactory product. It is easy to install and works exactly as described. It has very good range and excellent coverage.
5,Wireless Access Point,"This product worked as advertised, but it didn't solve the problem we got it for, which was interference from wireless surveillance cameras. Even with this access point in the same room, I couldn't get an iPod Touch to reliably use Wi-Fi connectivity if the surveillance cameras were active. The final solution was to get cameras that operate on 5.8 Mhz. You can find those by searching on Amazon. This access point however did work fine, and was easy to set up."
5,Wireless access point at its best.,This product is great. No antennas and I still get great signal strength. Its compact and perfect. Don't mind the price either.
5,This is the one...,"Yep, this is the one to buy. But don't try the fully wireless ""Repeater"" mode...their manual says nothing about how to configure it...and their tech support suggestions sounded like they were making it up."
3,Net Gear,"Purchased this Access point to go with my router. Everyone said you could pick up the weak signal and extend your network. I could not get it to work, nor could my garu son. I still have a NetGear Router and like net gear products. This one just didn't do what I wanted it to do. Extend my network on the same frequency so the print server would work also."
2,Range inferior and setup harder than Linksys,"I had a Linksys SRX but wanted a second access point to complete coverage in house. The linksys was an older model and one complaint was that it would randomly power off i think mostly after power outages. I put this netgear product in the same location and got half the bars on each of the multiple laptops that i use in the same location i used the linksys. I changed the position of the access point every which way possible. The linkys has better range by far. Also the setup requires that you plug it into a computer and change IP settings and then after its set up any setting changes will require that you take it off your router, change ip settings etc etc. not impossible but far less easy than the linksys set up and a much bigger pain managing it after installation."
4,"Works well, but the instructions are a bit lacking","I needed to buy a new wireless access point because the Link Sys I had... well... stank. It would lock up and need to be rebooted at least once per day if not more.I bought this one and got it hooked up in about half an hour or so. I've had it a few weeks now and I have not needed to reboot it one time.So, why the four stars? I only wish they had put as much thought into the instructions as they did the access point. In a lot of the steps, they only tell you to do things without actually telling you how to do them. I needed to use Google to do some of the steps like changing my IP address. It also doesn't give you a lot of help on the security set up, but luckily I have done that part before and I just set it to look like my old one.All in all, it is a good little access point, they just need to put some more effort into their instructions."
3,She was prettier in the store...,"I looked at this doll in the toystore, and she looked very pretty and different than all the other barbies. I didn't get her, until later when I saw her on a store on the internet. When I got her in the mail, she looked like all the other barbie dolls, but only with short hair. I was very disapointed. Although the price was good, I had fun with her in my display box. I guess she looked better in the store because the lighting was darker, and you don't see her that well. But she is still cute and I love her clothes."
1,Angry Customer/ 0 STARS!!!!!,I would love to rate this book. The only problem is I have not recieved it yet!!
2,"Great information, terrible editing","This is an excellent guide in terms of information, but the numerous typos on pages 26 and 27 (I counted 15, I believe) are terribly distracting. As an instructor, I think this guide is a valuable, educational source. However, I advise that customers wait for the new corrected edition."
2,expected more,"This book isn't what I expected. There is much more you have to know, if you want to learn the proper way of Pilates. But I would say, it could be a start."
3,Simple but useful,"It is not very in depth, but the book does break down the basic needs for understanding planes of movement and anatomy.I used it to study along with other books.Its just too basic for any real studying."
4,Essential for students or those with an interest in biology,"Studying year 12 biology myself, I've found this book invaluable for looking up terms, clarifying uncertainties, etc. The comprehensive list of defintions are concise, but you may find yourself looking up a word from the definition of the term you looked up just to understand the defintion if you're not too well-versed on biological terms (hence the usefulness of this book!) Anyway, my limited vocabulary of scientific terms aside, this book is great for those who are studying, or who just have an interest in all things living and want to use the correct terminology to express it, or for those who just want to understand someone else's scientific gobbly-gook."
3,Toolkit ? Well ... it is more phylosophical than practical,"I liked the first paragraphs, as it stresses some important points regarding KM. But is it really a toolkit ? It is not practical enough to be called a toolkit. There are better books to speak about knowledge management strategy or concepts. There are also shorter and much more concrete books about methods. This one mixes bit too much of all, it's overwelming."
2,More Theory Than Experience,"HelloIn general the book covers some interesting topics in KM, but as a toolkit it leaves a lot to be desired -- some actual hands on evidence of the utility of some of the approaches mentioned would have been useful and might have convinced me that this was a more practical book, however I didn't see too much of this.There were some funny tautologies and oxymorons smattered throughout the book and there are some interesting although well worn case studies.If you can read it in your library first then do so.Regards,Martyn R Jones Iniciativa Consulting Spain"
4,Good for me,"This book is useful. Good product. And the condition is ok. It is clean ,But no CD in the book."
3,"Just ok--thought it was a must have, but I could live without it.","I have a freezer full of frozen breastmilk for my baby, and every morning, I thaw out a bag of milk for his morning bottle. I saw this product and thought I MUST have it, but I am a little disappointed in it. It is nothing more than a tall plastic container to hold water and a bag of breastmilk. I find that it takes longer to thaw the breastmilk in this than it does just to hold the bag of milk under a faucet of warm water. The body of this container can be a little narrow for the Lansinoh breast milk storage bags, and I have actually had one of my bags punctured and the milk rendered useless because of the narrowness. Save yourself the $$ and just run it under warm water or let it thaw in the fridge and warm in a bottle warmer."
4,"Great for warming, useless for thawing","The mistake here is that it's called a ""Thaw and Warm Cup"". This product is useless for thawing - most products are. The best thing to do is take the milk out of the freezer the night before to thaw. That being said, I found it rather useful for warming milk. The lid keeps the bottle in place, which is always a problem when you try to warm the milk on the stovetop - the bottle just bobs around. Because you're using tap water, which even at it's hottest isn't scalding hot, you can avoid the hotspots some bottle warmers cause. Placing a bottle in the container, popping the lid on and turning on the faucet is all very easy to do with a squirmy baby in your hand as well!There may be a bottle warmer that is better than this product, but you're not going to get it for 10 dollars. Learning Curve should just remove the word ""Thaw"" from the product name."
2,"Great, but not dishwasher safe","This was great, until we put it in the dishwasher. It says top shelf dishwasher safe, but after running it through the the temperature sticker started coming off and the top 'cap' no longer held in place. One of the benefits of this over a bowl is that the lid keeps the bottle being warmed from floating out of the water. This helps the bottle warm faster since all of the milk is submerged. We tried contacting Firt Years to get the top replaced and were told they were not able to and to return it to the store. Surprised at the hassle and the warmer now serves limited purpose."
1,I was severely disappointed,"This is my first experience in shopping for Reggae. I've heard Reggae around and fell in love with it, problem is I've only heard Jamaican reggae (True reggae in my opinion). This CD is the most boring, placid and unexciting thing I think I've ever heard and I wish so much I never wasted the money. For those out there searching for reggae be very sure to be far more selective and careful than I since reggae comes in so many forms and if you don't find the one right for you you're going to be running for cover from a form not suited for you (Sheesh I am running too.)To sum up this CD ,from my own personal perspective, I'd say first the accoustics are low key, the music is sung like a mexican salsa, and the lyrics seem to be drudged up from a person with little imagination."
5,A pleasant Toscanini sampler,I enjoyed this as an album but now have no way to play it. The CD is just as wonderful.
5,"Exciting, funny, sad. This book has it all.","When I first came to the end of reading Watch My Back, I felt compelled to go right back to the start and read again. It isn't just a book about martial arts or bouncing - it is a book about life and the sort of fears and worries that we all have lurking within. And as with all of Geoff's other titles, there is something that we can all gain by reading them. Watch My Back really affected me and my life in many ways. Firstly, it made me realise that no matter who you are, we all have obsticals in life that can be overcome if we really want it. And secondly, it forced me to eventually meet and befriend Geoff, who is a great man. His advice has led me to try my hand at writing and I am now a published author myself. Watch My Back - simply superb!"
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"This CD could have been better if the company that produced it could've been a little more selective in the song listings. Some of the songs are pretty lousy while the others are good. The good songs are:""Cherokee"" by Charlie Barnet""Begin The Beguine"" by Artie Shaw""Don't Be That Way"" by Benny Goodman""Lonely Melody"" by Paul Whiteman""Opus One"" by Tommy DorseyThe other songs (however) are pretty lousy. If only they had selected another Glenn Miller song, than that would've been nice, but ""Song Of The Volga Boatmen"" is NOT one of his BETTER SONGS. Same thing with Tommy Dorsey's ""Opus One"" and Charlie Barnet's ""Cherokee."" But nonetheless, who cares?If they come out with another volume in this series, I hope theirs better songs."
3,A folkloristic insight into ancient attitudes.,"This book is a collection of stories told to Paul Bowles by a supposedly illiterate Moroccan with a great store of oral literature in his head. These stories are presented as representative examples of Moroccan folklore as passed down through the generations. One recurrent theme is the culture hero (similar to elder brother in other cultures) coming upon an unjust situation and making it right. It may be a hearkening back to the Caliphate of Cordova that in several of these stories the unjust situation consists of a Christian ruling over Muslim subjects -- the hero corrects this situation by killing the ruler and restoring Muslim rule. In light of present-day political strife, reading these culturally relevatory stories may be instructive."
2,It does NOT come with 120 foot hose-it has NO hose!!,Amazon needs to change the copy for this product. It does NOT come with the hose! Now I need to find a hose that will fit the sprayer. You can't use the foamer in a drain because it does not spray on its side and you can't stand it up and have the foam actually go into the drain. The product itself works just fine-it is that it is almost worthless without a hose!
4,Great reading!,My son has been reading this book and loves the illustrations as well as the detailed writing. ++
1,Maybe more like Mastering Kung Fool,"The authors have taken old articles and China myths and spun them to suit their own marketing plan. Looking at the moves, you can see it is derived from William Chung's WC and the poor use of shoulders and silly facial expressions only makes me laugh."
5,Someone Has done thier reseach,"This book is definitly a higher level of thinking than all the other wing chun books I have read. I am a senior instructor thru the Ving Tsun Athletic Association and most of the books out there our still at the technical level of thinking not truely getting in depth in the principles and science aspects. The history is for more logical than the famous nun story. This book also is the first of its kind to truely connect the spiritual and philosophical aspect to Wing Chun. The time and space chapter was really good by explaining a science perspective like I haven't seen before. It has definitly made me more aware of the uderstanding of the system as a whole, not a small part."
1,handbook to happiness,"Very unsatisfied with this company. Said I was to receive a new book... and received a worn, used book, that even had writing in it."
3,Good direction,"Solomon's Handbook to Happiness basically directs Christians to be crucified with Christ, and then to rise with Him in victory. According to the book, once a Christian does this, all his or her emotional problems go away. I think this is a wonderfull idea. If and when we realize that we are not on this earth to please ourselves, we become almost immune to all and any problems this life can throw at us. However, I think that knowing what to do in your head and actually doing it are two different things. I think this book is especially helpful in assisting a Christian to realize that he or she has not fully surrendered his or her life to Christ. It helped me to understand that, and now I can say that I have, at least in some part, tasted the peace that comes from recklessly abandoning your own ambitions and living for Christ or as the book would say allowing Christ to live through you."
5,great service,I was very satisfied with the prompt delivery and the excellent condition of the product. I would do business with this sellor again.
5,Office fun,A great read from your office desk. Anything to avoid another meeting with the evil boss with horns on his head.
1,Could have been good,"Only the first 26 pages downloaded, and couldn't getthe rest of it to load. The others seem to have worked."
4,Excuse Me While I Wag,"This is one of those books you want read because you liked so must the previous. You will keep reading it waiting for that incredible funny smell of absurd reality. And you keep it reading until the end. Yes, you will find some thing to laugh about, some others to realy cry. But a really, really fun joke? It will be like digging gold."
3,what happened?,"I'm a big fan of the Carrier series, I've read 1-15 in sequence, and whenever I see one in a bookstore ...I get it. But #15 disappointed me. The writing was as exciting as usual but it seemed to end very abruptly without resolving many of the issues laid out in the plot. They just ended up with the usual big air battle but we never found out what happened to the main villain or the main characters he held in custody or what happened with the secret diplomacy going on at the UN. It was like there were 4 or 5 chapters missing because Keith had a deadline for publication. Maybe some of the story will get resolved in #16. I gave it 3 stars because it's part of a great series but on its own I would only give it a 2."
3,Where's the index?,"The cover of this book boldly states: ""Great index helps you quickly locate the type of problem you need to solve."" Ha! There is no index in the book. This severely limits its utility as a quick look-up for problem solving techniques. The Table of Contents is more detailed than most but it is no substitute for an index."
5,Great book overall!!,"I have never read any of Iain H. Murray's books before, but i will now. This book deals with the little known history of Christianity in Australia. He uses extensive quotes and primary sources (many of them the personal correspondence of the people he writes about, as well as personal accounts etc.) and it includes a map and many illustrations made from those times. Being an Australian Christian pastor himself, he does not only the history justice, but the presentation of it as well. i was very pleasantly surprised.It is only an introduction, so it necessarily takes more of an overview, but it goes into the right amount of detail that you would expect. Needless to say, it is well worth the purchase. Just right for a layman interested in the Christianity of Australia."
4,All That You Are,"Once again W. M. Hubbard has reached into her colorful and creative bag and outdone herself. It is truly a pleasure to include her and her works with my family during quality time. ""We"" ARE ""All That You Are""."
2,A picture book for (some) adults,"Short on text but not on depth, graphic artist Woodleigh Hubbard offers an extremely colorful ego boost. Although the book is quite pleasant, I cannot imagine myself as a child connecting with any bit of it. According to Hubbard, one should hug an elephant if it steps on your bicycle. ""You Forgive"" commands the text, and, obviously it was an accident, as the elephant is shedding a single tear. This seems another of those ""picture books for parents"" we always wish we had a separate shelf for. Buy it if you have the new age parents who need such affirmations. Hopefully the bright, whimsical illustrations will hold the kids' interest because they are good enough, smart enough, and dog-gone it, they deserve it."
5,"Sweet, Sweet Tunes","Fathom is an EXCELLENT album and Sattie Clark is an INCREDIBLE artist. This album has everything a true music fan craves. First, Sattie's voice is nothing short of angelic. How she hits and holds some of those notes, I'll never understand. This gal can sing.The lyrics are awesome. Without music the words stand alone as beautiful poetry. They instigate deep thinking and contemplations of pain and loss, acceptance and forgiveness, and ultimately, peace and hope.The music behind the voice is solid and very original. In addition to the wonderful acoustic guitar, there are selections featuring haunting cello and groovy electric guitar. The drumming is exceptional.This is the rare album that you don't skip through to hear that one good song. Every song is very good and flows easily to the next. This is the right stuff.The folks in Chico, California are impatiently waiting for Sattie to tour."
3,Cute book,"This is a cute book. However I had intended to use it with struggling 2nd graders. I think that they would consider it too babyish., so I haven't used it with them. Although my 4 year old thinks this book is great!!"
2,"Seller did not deliver my book, but Amazon made good on their guarantee!","I would very much like to read this book by the Rogue Investor, but the seller did not deliver on the goods. I took my complaint to Amazon and they refunded my money. Yay for Amazon!"
1,forget it,"I've liked everthing this lady has written. Well, at leastI did until I read this book. Story is okay, but leavingthe body on the imiganing chamber floor was just a littleto much and I couldn't get past it to enjoy the rest ofthe story."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this product from a company called Worldwide Liquidators. The press that I got is a Cummins that got relabed as a Pro-Tech. Mine is absolutely identical to this model. I was really excited about this press but once I got it put together and started using it, I'm horribly let down. The main problem is that there is about 1/8 inch of play in the spindle when it's extended. I can wiggle the drill bit in a circle with tons of play. When the spindle is completely raise, there is no play, but if you pull down on a handle, there comes the play. I don't know if mine is defective or what, but I don't want to buy another one."
1,Broken tool and BAD VENDOR,"I purchased this drill press for a low price, but it was not a good deal because it didnt't work at all, dead since the first day. I said to myself ""I'm not lucky!"", but I was much more disappointed when I called Cummins Industrial for the return & refund; they accepted to pay only for the cost of the return shipping and not for the first shipping. Please note that they sent me a not working item ...ZERO STARS!. I didn't give up and I filed a claim with Amazon which resolved the problem with courtesy and professionality (5 stars for Amazon!)"
4,Ferguson fan from way back,Maynard Ferguson was a musical genius. The MF horn variations on this CD are out of this world.
2,"Again, second rate city, third rate writer","Just another example of Mr. Lindberg's pitiful attempt at exhibiting a strong expertise on a subject with which he is clearly obsessed. Don't waste your time with this book, either. It is poorly written and fails to engage the reader. You might consider using this book and the first book he wrote on the same subject, as a pair of bookends. That is about all they are worth."
5,Do not hesitate - Buy this book!,"Anyone who is a Foster or Adoptive Parent, needs this book on their bedside table! Simple to read, easy to understand, and enlightening for all, dealing/living with ""kids in care"". I would reccommend this book be mandatory for all Child Care Agencies to provide to Foster/Adoptive parents!Thank you Mr. Delany and please keep the books coming!"
2,Not a guide,"When one is researching culinary schools it helps to have some sort of a way of classifying them. Unfortuneatly the author decided to only list the schools, with almost no other information. I now know the name of every culinary school in texas, and he missed a couple(!), but I know next to nothing about them. All the information listed is what degrees or certificates they offer. No real information on quality.Frankly I found better information for free online. Unless you can't locate information online this book is largely worthless."
4,"A fascinating, inspiring, scary, and rambling story","I read Glasser's _The Body is the Hero_ many years ago and first had some idea of ""modern"" immunology, a la 1970 or so. Totally fascinating. This book rambles more (I'm not sure why he did this) but again gives me a new perspective on immunology, viruses, cancer, AIDS, the medical establishment, viral disease, the history of medicine and the evolution of life. I could scarcely put it down, and I wish I had an update, since a book published in 1997 probably represents the status as of 1995 or 1996. He covers the whole range of history of medicine, focussing on Pasteur and after, and also theories and data on the evolution of living system and immmune systems. And has some pretty horrible stories about how the med. establishment and governments have dealt with AIDS, mad cow disease, etc. And left me with hope."
5,Probably the best GU released so far,"alright, I was not going to write anything but I am just sick and tired of all these elitist technofiles labeling everything that has a melody as 'commercial.' Why is melody bad? what world are you guys from? Melody is what music is all about. Sure, minimalistic stuff that digweed spins (example: Hong Kong and LA) is good but it is not as accessible, and you need to be in the right mood to enjoy it. Seaman tries to appeal to a wider audience, and so what? This notion that if your tracks have some sort of melody, no matter how good, then you are not a 'true' dj is nonsense. by the way, Seaman's selections, while more accessible than those of, say, sasha or digweed, still do not represent mainstream dance music. seaman is very good at mixing minimal with melodic tracks. I love this compilation, and if you liked seaman's Renaissance Awakening, you will too. enough said."
4,Cd 2,"I went back and bought this album after buying Renaissance and being blow away. In fact, I've gone back and bought a lot of Seaman. The cd is off to a slow start and picks up a little bit with Moby's Porcelain. It also has Way Out West, James Holden and Junkie XL. The second disc is a superb set but the first disc falls short."
4,Mood music of Cape Town,"After leaving Cape Town I picked up this CD. Now I listen to it whenever I need to be reminded of the Beat Boutique, Baraka or any of the other Cape Town clubs that make me long to return. Dave Seaman's mixes take you to places far away from the U.S., or let you return to places you call home."
3,not bad but definently not as good as ...,"I eagerly bought this album after absolutely loving Dave's Buenos Aires set. Theres nothing really wrong with either CDs here, except that a lot of it is very BORING, especially the middle half of CD2. CD1 was definently better, but ending with breeders tyratanic was disappointing because by that point youre really expecting a fast uplifting song and you get instead a song with a hundred pauses. Anyways, I know that a lot of DJs are recently changing their style...."
2,Boring and comercial set!,"I'm very disappointed with this set, definitively all the tracks are very comercial trance and boring, strange to be a GU CD,nothing to do with the Global underground quality sets, if you like the comercial trance buy it.Definitivamente para los que les gusta el trance burdo y comercial este es un buen CD, mas nada que ver con las maravillas que habiamos escuchado como por ejemplo Ibiza de Sasha o Moscu de Deep Dish, creo que es muy el estilo de Seaman ya que se asemeja mucho al set de Buenos Aires."
1,Too little for the title,"This book does contain a few nuggets, but falls severely short of Jerry's wisdom. Most of the one-liners are catchy, sometimes introspective, sometimes humorous, but for those who have not read enough interviews with the man, to take this little book as a summation of the man's wisdom would be folly. Jerry had so much more to say (and he did) about things like life than this book contains. Someone who doesn't know any better and bases his/her opinion of the man's influence on millions of lives on this book will end up being disappointed and ultimately dismissive of the man's greatness. For true insights into the man's wisdom, read his interviews! Read ""Garcia"" by the editors of Rolling Stone! Please! and besides, i don't believe this book was cooked up by David Gans. Too bad I can't really check the book itself since I'm away from home, but I trust that David Gans would not be so careless."
4,Jerry Jerry... that crazy Jerry!,"You gotta love Jerry's wit and candor. Not a complete account of his quotes by any means, but there are some real gems here. Pick it up, read a few pages, reflect... repeat."
3,something to read when youre stoned,"it's no large-scale biographical informative piece of work, but it holds a lot of insightful and curious quotes that weren't previously held in that sort of solo light before. besides, each page takes about two hot seconds to read... the perfect bible for any head."
2,Lovely and Fruitful!,"This was a wonderful. The bit about the horses running in the field of corn was my favourite! Sammy the Lamb was my best character. I hated snoopy the snoop, though."
5,back to the fusion,"When you first heard this band live, it was like hearing a more rocking version of the Crusaders (with Joe Sample and Larry Carlton on board, bringing the notable sonic similarity). This was a great band to hear live, it's a shame they didn't stay together long enough to record a live album at the Baked Potato in North Hollywood where this band used to woodshed. This great record will give you a taste of how ""fusion"" can be when it's done with true taste and jazz chops. No overbearing typewriter music or ridiculous overtures, just foot-tapping fun. And Scott's beautiful ""Spindrift"" is worthwhile all by itself, a beautiful melodic mood enhanced by the sound of Carlton's silky guitar and drummer John Guerin's wonderful rhythmic spirit."
4,Tom Scott,"Meant to buy the record in college, when so many of my friends did. Meant to do buy the tape a few years later. Meant to buy the CD. Finally broke down a got the digital version - now I feel better."
2,you must of ate too much glitter,"thought it would be fun romp, but the entire album isn't that great.. a few songs stand out.. but will not be playing this album much at all, if ever.."
3,Better of Elsewhere,"My son loves watching the manufacturing process. He has the ""How'd they Build That"" videos for garbage trucks, school buses, and concrete mixers. The problem with the fire truck video, according to him, is that there is little actual manufacturing--the video shows the trucks in action more than the actual making of the truck."
4,Very good reference material,The video was very instrumental in the instruction of my fire science class. It peaked my class of fire science students interest in a piece of equipment that plays a major role in their chosen profession.
1,Who should buy this book?,"I had Vista removed from my HP computer in favor of XP as an easier step up from Windows 98. Then, just because I had never navigated XP, ""thought"" ""Windows XP"" would a different approach with pictures and text. And the used version was advertised as ""like new."" The cost was low, too. But the book arrived late, sent first class mail by someone with a conscience, but was not as advertised by seller. Cover was bent--the quizzes were partially filled in by a student. Bad advertising! Plus the book seemed to me to lack text explaining the ""pretty pictures,"" and I certainly didn't need a full page photograph of Bill Gates.Wish I had saved my husband's money. Constance Kritzberg"
1,don't get it if you haven't read the manga - not good by itself,"If I had read the manga, I'm sure I would enjoy seeing it brought to life, but as a stand-alone it's not worth it. The characters aren't very developed and the story line is definitely lacking. It's short. The extras are nothing fun. The artwork is passable; I've seen worse but it's nothing exceptional. The voices aren't that appealing (a big selling point for me when it comes to anime). It was a waste of money, honestly."
3,I'd hold out for Gravitation,"Kizuna seems to have an old school anime look, and the feel of the movie is just akward... I'm willing to venture it has little to do with the actual series being a one shot movie. I would hold out for Gravitation if I needed to be selective with my DVD library. Fake is also a little better than Kizuna, but not by leaps and bounds. Just an opinion!"
3,Philmore Rocks!,"I bought this cd after hearing them at a concert were i thought they were pretty good. After listening to the cd i think they're excellent. Their lyrics seem so genuine, and i feel that i can relate to what they are saying, there is not a song on this cd i don't like, which means I can listen to it over and over again. The first four songs are all really good, including the cover of Living on a Prayer. As I Lift My Hands is a gorgeous worship song. You cannot go wrong buying this cd."
5,profound and very fitting for our age,"Steve Scott is so beyond his time it ain't funny. As a Christian musician, he has produced far too little music. If he had 50 albums, I'd buy ever single one of 'em. That being said, I had no idea his writing would be so deep, so profound.""Like a house on fire"" reads like a college textbook, and it should be required at any Christian campus teaching arts. Why as an artist do you create? What is the role of an artist in society? What is the role of a Christian? Are they compatible? Can the arts be redeemed? There is enough food for thought in here to keep your mind fed for months, and to get you renewed in serving Jesus with a purpose beyond what you thought possible."
2,red shoe diaries dvdr,"I did not know it was a dvdr copy off of vhs no doubt, disapointing it was not noted in the listing as dvdr"
4,good but concise,"This text may not have the academic depth of the ""dragon book"" (Aho et al.), but it provides concise, professional, balanced coverage of the essential concepts of syntax analysis, code generation, code optimization, and the like. Also, in distancing itself from certain gory implementational details, the book also keeps its distance from the almost de rigueur UNIX bent of Aho and its ilk. After all, there are other tools in the world than yacc and lex: indeed, I found yacc to be quite problematic when (some years ago) building an instrumentation tool for Model 204 User Language, a beast more syntactically bizarre and outside-the-box than even FORTRAN 66 (now, can you imagine that, sonny boy?)."
2,MEH!!!!!,"Okay, this album... isn't that good. It's a bunch of LP songs deformed into technoish music... I couldn't even tell what some of the songs were! It's that bad. Some people might like this though... if your looking for a tribute to linkin park that is good, check out the string quertet one"
5,Gaither Homecoming Friends,"Bill Gaither, Vestal Goodman, Ben Speer..we all know these names and talents. We often forget ,though, who gave them their talents. God. This cd reminds us of that. It's amazing to know that He smiles down on each of us, especially these veterans of the Southern Gospel world as they raise their voices high toward Him. Bless His Holy Name, I Will Glory in the Cross, Holy Ground. We all know these songs. They go back a long way, but their meaning never changes. This cd is SO amazing; no one could ever give it only one star. I don't know how people can listen to hard rock, pop, and other music, when this one cd can satisfy their very need. It is THAT amazing. I reccommend this to everyone."
1,rubbish,"This video is nothing but highlights of the players, most of whom were no big deal, with monotonous voices spouting platitudes. I got it free, but I still want money back, because I'll never get back the time I wasted on this. Legends? Quinn, Abiamiri, Shark, Carlson? Not by any stretch of the imagination.My only regret (other than watching it) is that I can't give zero stars."
5,Thoroughly impressed,"Jackie Greene simply shines on this album. He took two steps forward, no steps back, and turned out a collection that is as varied and layered as his influences seem to be. His voice is noticibly stronger and more refined than on his previous efforts, and the musicianship on this album is top-of-the-line. True rock'n'roll fans rejoice: with this album Greene proves that there is at least one young artist making creative and inspired music even as the artistic standards of the mainstream music industry crumble around his feet. I only hope Greene finds a large enough audience that recognizes quality when they hear it, so we can continue to enjoy the evolution of a truly rare talent. In short (just in case it didn't go without saying), I highly recommend this album to any thinking music fan."
3,not his best work,"Im a Jackie greene fan yes. I've seen him live, own his others cds and his dvd. This is by far the worst cd hes released. The definition of supersede (song # 13 on the album) is to replace, and thats exactly what I did with this disc in my cd changer. Its just too poppy for me. Im all for change but this Im sorry was a bad one. With that said, I still think Jackie Greene is talented and has some songs that are worth it on this album. Now, some people will like this album (as a whole) and i'll understand fully, its a decent set of songs, just not something I can listen to like the days I wore out his other albums."
1,Are you people kidding me?,"I saw this dude open for Mavis Staples last summer in SF and it was the most masturbatory, by-the-numbers, stale as crotons show I've seen in many years. No question this guy knows how to play, but this material is just plain boring. I mean, this smug, sunglasses-wearing, vintage-guitar-collecting poser makes the Black Crowes look like the Faces. If you're really looking for some down homey sounding tube-driven rock made within the last 15 years or so, you might want to look the way of the Jayhawks or Uncle Tupelo (and their offshoots)."
4,Great album for a fan of great music.,"I became hooked on Jackie Greene after hearing him sing and play with Phil Lesh and Friends, and this is his first solo album that I bought. I was not dissappointed in the least.The album starts very storng and by the third track, ""So Hard to Find My Way"" you are engrossed by not only the music but the lyrics. The middle of the album slows down quite a bit and I thought another up beat song would have been a good addition.Slow or not this is a great album that everyone should check out. I can't wait for his other albums to come out. He is an up and coming and we need more artist and musicians like this rather than the current ""performers"" that plague todays music world."
4,Well-crafted music and lyrics,"Bluesy, folky, country-y, indie-y, familiar sounds, very well-crafted, intelligent, and really good to listen to, from edge to edge.Jackie Greene and Jacob Dylan: separated at birth? Tell me if you don't hear Nora Jones and Sufjan Stevens, too.Great for a sunny day in a beautiful place, while getting ready to go out and do something fun!"
1,don't stick,"These look great, but they don't stick on any rounded surfaces. I cleaned my bike with rubbing alchhol, they still didn't stick. don't bother unless your using it on a completely flat surfaces."
1,flame decals,"I was extremely disappointed!!!! I loved the design itself, and bought them to accent my new 2009 bicycle. I properly applied 8 decals on my bike; however, on my very first ride, they all came off but one. They just peeled right up. I was bummed. If there was any way to get my money back, I would have. It was a total waste as far as I am concerned. I really wanted them to work properly because they would have looked good. My advice: don't buy these decals!"
